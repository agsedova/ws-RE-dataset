Founded in 1878, the school is housed in the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the oldest private cultural institution in Washington, located on The Ellipse, facing the White House. The Corcoran School is part of GW's Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and was formerly an independent college, until 2014.\n\nWilliam Wilson Corcoran founded the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1869. Construction had begun at 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in 1859, but shortly after the exterior work was completed, the Quartermaster General's corps of the Union Army occupied the building, setting up offices for the duration of the Civil War.\n\nWork resumed immediately after the conclusion of the war, with Corcoran formally founding his gallery as an institution in 1869. The first special event held that year was a fundraiser for the completion of the Washington Monument. Corcoran's gallery welcomed its first visitors in 187, which included art students, who were eager to sketch and paint copies of the collection's famous works.\n\nIn 1877, the painter E.F. Andrews (1835–1915) started offering the visiting students and artists formal instruction in two dimensional media for no cost. In 1878, William Wilson Corcoran donated additional funding to be used to establish a school to be associated with the gallery. After Corcoran's 1888 death, a small building was built in 1889 for the purpose of the gallery's burgeoning identity as a place for education in the arts. In 1890 the school officially opened as the Corcoran School of Art.\n\nBy the 1890s, both the gallery and the school programs had outgrown their respective spaces. A new, larger building designed by Ernest Flagg was constructed in 1897 at New York Avenue and 17th Street, with the basement level dedicated to workshops and studios for the students, and an upper two floors given over to large gallery spaces. From 1897 to the 1930s, the school continued in a modest existence for art students interested in a museum school. By the 1930s, the school had begun expanding: commercial art classes, scholarships, children's courses, the library, ceramics facilities and courses, weekend classes and summer opportunities were added.\n\nSuccessful accreditation in the National Association of Schools of Art (NASAD) was achieved in the mid-1970s, with the first BFA degree bestowed in 1978. During this time artists that taught at the school included Gene Davis, Tom Downing, Sam Gilliam, Anne Truitt, Ed McGowin, William Christenberry,Percy Martin and Paul Reed.\n\nStarting in the 1970s, the College utilized three facilities: the historic Flagg Building housed fine art facilities, the fine art photography and photojournalism facilities. A second building, in Georgetown, housing the Digital Media, Graphic Design, and New Media Photojournalism programs, as well as many fine art offerings in painting and drawing. Additional programs were offered through the Smithsonian's S. Dillon Ripley Center. In 1985, the college was formally accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\nIn 1999, the school was formally renamed as The Corcoran College of Art and Design and worked to further its reputation as the singular four-year arts and design institution in Washington, D.C. As a museum school, students and faculty benefited from co-existing with the Corcoran Gallery with its more than 17,000 works and objects. In the later years of the gallery, a dedicated space known as Studio 31 displayed student art, in addition to special biennials and exhibitions of student work on display throughout the year. The annual NEXT show, staged at the end of each academic year, displayed student senior thesis projects to the greater DC community.\n\nIn 2014, a D.C. Superior Court approved agreement saw the closure of the Gallery and the passing of most of the original collection into the public National Gallery of Art. The Flagg Building and college operations were handed over to the George Washington University, which today operates the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design within the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe Corcoran School of the Arts and Design currently offers the degrees of Bachelor of Fine Arts (in Fine Art, Fine Art Photography, Photojournalism, Graphic Design, Interaction Design, and Interior Architecture); Bachelor of Arts (in Fine Art, Art History, Theatre & Dance and Music); Master of Fine Arts (in Fine Arts, Interior Architecture, Classical Acting and Production Design); Master of Arts (in Art History, New Media Photojournalism, Museum Studies, Interaction Design, Exhibition Design, and—in partnership with the Smithsonian Associates—Decorative Arts and Design History); graduate certificates in Museum Collections Management and Care, and Museum Studies; and a joint BA/MA program. After merging with George Washington University, the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design discontinued their Interior Design and Art Education programs.\n\nStudents are exposed to internships with organizations including National Geographic Magazine, embassies, and White House news photographers; summer study abroad trips in Italy, Greece, and India; and visiting artists such as Annie Leibovitz, Shepard Fairey, Maya Lin, Abelardo Morell, and William Pope. For a period of time in the spring, senior students' works for their senior theses are exhibited within the museum, giving the students experience in gallery openings as well as public exposure to their work.\n\nThe College's Continuing Education Program, which offers partial credit and non-credit classes to children and adults, draws more than 3,500 participants every year. The Corcoran offers a pre-college portfolio development program in the summer for high school students.\n\nNotable alumni of the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design include:\n"}

They are endemic to Madagascar. The three Dyscophus species differ in chromatin pattern. Both sexes of D. guineti show a heteromorphic chromosome pair 11, with one element larger (11a) than the other 11b due to the presence of the large terminal tract on the short arm with an euchromatic band enclosed between two heterochromatic bands. This condition in dyscophus probably characterizes the beginning of a cladogenetic process. \n\nThe common name comes from \"D. antongilii\"'s bright red color. When threatened, a tomato frog puffs up its body. When a predator grabs a tomato frog in its mouth, the frog's skin secretes a thick substance that numbs up the predator's eyes and mouth, causing the predator to release the frog to free up its eyes. The gummy substance contains a toxin that occasionally causes allergic reactions in humans. The allergic reaction will not kill a human and the frog secretes it only when frightened.\n\nThe lifespan of the tomato frog can be from 6 to 8 years.\nWhen adult, the colors may vary from yellowish orange to deep red. Tomato frogs will reach sexual maturity in 9–14 months. Females are larger than males and can reach 4 inches in length. Males can reach 2 to 3 inches in length. Most females range from reddish-orange bright dark red. The bellies are usually more yellowish, and sometimes there are black spots on the throat. But males are not as brightly colored but more of a duller orange or brownish-orange. Juveniles are also dull in color and develop brighter coloration as they mature. They are also on the endangered species list. They breed in the rainy season and are nocturnal. They tend to eat small insects and invertebrates.\n\nThere are three different species:\n\nTomato frogs lay fresh eggs during every month of the year except for November. Their reproductive activity is high during the months January–May and low between the months June–December.\n\n"}

Gardner\n\nRichard Alan Gardner (April 28, 1931 – May 25, 2003) was an American child psychiatrist known for his work in psychotherapy with children, parental alienation and child custody evaluations. Gardner introduced the term Parental alienation syndrome (PAS). He wrote 41 books and more than 200 professional journal articles and book chapters. He developed child play therapy and test materials which he published through his company Creative Therapeutics. Gardner was an expert witness in child custody cases. Gardner and his work have been both disputed and supported.\n\nGardner graduated from Columbia College, Columbia University in 1952 and SUNY Downstate Medical Center in 1956. After internship at the Montefiore Hospital, he completed residencies in adult psychiatry and in child psychiatry at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. He was certified as a psychoanalyst in 1966 after training at the William Alanson White Institute.\n\nIn 1960-1962 he worked as director of child psychiatry in the U.S. Army Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.\n\nGardner's professional affiliations included American Psychiatric Association, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Psychoanalysis, American Medical Association, American Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians and American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.\n\nFrom 1963 until his death Gardner was a clinical professor at Columbia University's medical school, Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. He also held academic teaching appointments at the William A. White Psychoanalytic Institute (1966–83), the University of Louvain, Belgium (1980–82) and at the University of St. Petersburg, Russia (1989-1997). \nGardner wrote about false allegations of sexual abuse in his 1990 book \"Sex Abuse Hysteria: Salem Witch Trials Revisited\". He assisted the defense team of Margaret Kelly Michaels which successfully appealed her prison conviction in the Wee Care Nursery School abuse trial.\n\nIn 1970 when divorce was becoming more common in the United States, Gardner wrote \"Boys and Girls Book About Divorce\" to provide children with suggestions on how to cope. In 1973 he created one of the first board games for use in child psychotherapy.\n\nHis views stirred considerable controversy and he published rebuttals of his critics' arguments.\n\nGardner's observation of a \"parental alienation syndrome\" focused on how one parent may misuse the powers of socialization to turn a child against a once loved parent. Gardner's labeling of alienation processes as a \"syndrome\" remains controversial among psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists. PAS has not been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association or any other medical or professional association. It has been extensively criticized by scientists and jurists, who describe it as inadmissible in child custody hearings based on both science and law. Gardner's claims that PAS is scientifically valid and legally admissible have been disputed. Proposals to include PAS in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders have been controversial. DSM-5 Task Force Chair David Kupfer and DSM-5 Task Force Public Representative James McNulty have written letters to concerned professionals that PAS will not be included in DSM-5.\n\nCarol S. Bruch, Research Professor of Law at the University of California, Davis, implied that Dr. Gardner's description of PAS could inflict emotions on his audience. She found lack of careful analysis and rigor among the adopters of Dr. Gardner's observations.\n\nIn a 2002 article in the \"American Journal of Family Therapy\", Gardner dismissed most of his critics as either biased or misinformed. \"Attorneys frequently select out-of-context material in order to enhance their positions in courts of law... some of these misperceptions and misrepresentations have become so widespread that I considered it judicious to formulate this statement,\" he wrote.\n\nIn the same article, Gardner denied that he condoned pedophilia. \"I believe that pedophilia is a bad thing for society,\" he wrote. \"I do believe, however, that pedophilia, like all other forms of atypical sexuality is part of the human repertoire and that all humans are born with the potential to develop any of the forms of atypical sexuality (which are referred to as paraphilias by DSM-IV). My acknowledgment that a form of behavior is part of the human potential is not an endorsement of that behavior. Rape, murder, sexual sadism, and sexual harassment are all part of the human potential. This does not mean I sanction these abominations.\"\n\nGardner also advocated against mandatory reporting laws for child abuse, against immunity from prosecution of individuals reporting child abuse and for the creation of programs with federal funding designed to assist individuals claimed to be falsely accused of child abuse.\n\nGardner was born in The Bronx on April 28, 1931. Gardner had three children with Lee Gardner before their divorce.\n\nAfter his suicide on May 25, 2003 at age 72, his son revealed that Gardner was suffering from type I complex regional pain syndrome, a neurological syndrome formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy.\n\n"}

They also destroy embryos in the womb, causing miscarriage, and can steal babies forty days after childbirth, replacing them with imps. They are male and female. They have clay noses and fiery eyes, and \"appear with sharp fangs, disheveled hair, copper claws, iron teeth, the tusks of a wild boar and sagging breasts, resembling a crone.\" After stealing the organs of a woman, the al attempts to escape and cross the first source of water, after which the woman cannot be saved.

{"id": "2274226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274226", "title": "Flutina", "text": "Flutina\n\nThe Flutina is an early precursor to the diatonic button accordion, having one or two rows of treble buttons, which are configured to have the tonic of the scale, on the \"draw\" of the bellows. There is usually no bass keyboard: the left hand operates an air valve (silent except for the rush of air). A rocker switch, called a \"bascule d'harmonie\" is in the front of the keyboard. When this switch is thumb activated, it would open up a pallet (a pad that covers a tone hole, at the other end of the key button(s), (see photo) for a simple Tonic/Dominant drone: Tonic on the draw and Dominant on the press, e.g. Tonic notes C/g, and Dominant G/d, without any major or minor thirds.\n\nMany of these \"Flutina\" accordions were imported into the United States and were common photographers' studio props. This imparted a touch of \"culture\" to the sitter, hence the many tintype, ambrotype, etc. images of men and women, with their hands poised over \"Flutinas\", which they may (or may not) have actually played. Many of the images date from the 1850s through the American Civil War period (1861–1865).\nThe internal construction of the flutina resembles the English Wheatstone concertina more than the \"reed banks\" used in regular accordion construction. Thus, it has a concertina-like sound. Underneath the pallet/keyboard face, there is a rectangular, wooden board, reed pan, with reed chambers, made with airtight, leather covered, thin wooden dividers. These dividers are between the reeds, for the diatonic scale notes. The brass reed tongues are mounted on reed shoes, with each tongue nailed on with a single metal pin. These reed shoes (or frames) are inserted into dovetail-shaped slots into the top side of the pan. If the keyboard has two rows of keys, the outside row plays the diatonic scale, while the inside row plays the sharps and flats, and these chromatic reeds face the interior of the bellows, in dovetailed slots on the backside of the pan board, without any dividers. The face of the pallet/keyboard actually slides out to reveal the inset reed pan, reminiscent of the construction of a pencil box, or a Japanese puzzle box. The accordion bellows has a very short \"throw\" (the maximum extension of the bellows, when drawn out), with most instruments having only four folds. Larger versions had 5 to 7 folds in the bellows. The use of the 4 fold bellows made the duration of the note played very short, and the volume of the note comparatively soft, in contrast to the later \"German\" style accordions, with their larger, multi-fold bellows.\n\nThe term \"flutina\" is actually a more specific English name for a version of the \"accordéon diatonique\", \"accordéon mélodique\", \"clavier\" (keyboard) \"mélodique\", or even \"accordéon romantique\". Instrument makers of the 19th century often invented many distinct names for all these \"new\" versions of the same instrument. In addition, English musical instrument dealers\nwould switch the brass reeds out of the French instruments, and replace them with steel reeds. Then, these English dealers\nwould stamp their own company name inside the instrument, or the stamp of the specific store that was selling the accordion.\nThis was a common practice in the 19th century and has continued to be used by many reputable, as well as disreputable,\nmusical instrument dealers.\n\nAll these names, which the French makers gave these instruments, have the pallets on the outside, but the name \"Flutina\" implies an accordion with the pallets opening on the interior side of the face, just above the buttons, and the air exiting from a narrow slot in back of the protruding keyboard. This feature was supposed to give a more \"flute-like\" tone to the reeds. Whether the French makers ever used the name \"Flutina\" is not known.\n\nThe earliest version was known as the \"Clavier Melodique\" (\"melodious keyboard\"), circa 1831. It was made by Pichenot Jeune (\"Young Pichenot\"), and was probably one of the first accordions capable of playing a melody. The first recorded factory was that of Napoleon Fourneaux in Paris.\n\nThe Accordion of Cyril Demian (1829) described in his Austrian (at Vienna) patent application, had 5 pallets with 10 chords (musical triads) available. It all depended on which direction the player moved the bellows. One key pressed down had 2 chords: one chord on the \"press\" (in) and the other chord, on the \"draw\" (out). Demian also produced some Accordions with a single note per button \"on the draw\" or, \"on the press\". One of his models, had single notes and two rows of keys: first row the diatonic scale, the second row played the accidentals. The accordion tutor published in the Year of 1833 by Adolph Müller (Austrian National Bibliotheca) has an example which includes pictures and descriptions of many different models. A music journal of Paris, printed in the year of 1831, has many details about the beginning of accordion production in Paris. The article starts out with the statement that the first accordion was copied from a Demian instrument, and later, Demian invented many different scale systems, but only later French models had some buttons in the second row being divided in the middle.\nMore information about it, is in the German Wikipedia. \"\" text.\nNote: After Demian's 1829 patent, there is some controversy about the exact dates of further inventions, and the times of applied manufacture, of accordions. Thus, opinions differ, somewhat, among musical instrument historians.\n\n1837, an advertisement in the musical news paper „LE MENESTREL“ of M. Reisner, selling accordions.\nBy 1845, There were many makers of accordions, listed in various journals: Alexandre, Fourneaux, Jaulin, Lebroux, Neveux, Kasriel, Leterme, Reisner, Busson, M. Klaneguisert. All of these makers sold two different models at that time: one without any chromatic accidentals (a diatonic one row or two row system), and one two rows of buttons with accidentals (diatonic outside row/chromatic inside row.)\n\nA single scale system for these accordions was not universally adopted: Many competing \"key layouts\" existed. These variations offered slightly differing advantages to the player, and were \"championed\" by the different manufacturers.\nLater versions of the \"Flutina\" had a few open (tonic and fifth) chords available on the bass side, in addition to the silent \"air\" key. The most famous maker of these \"flutina\" accordions was Busson of Paris. Busson also is thought to have had a part in the development of the piano accordion (circa 1880s). The heyday of the \"Flutina\" was approximately from 1840 to 1880. In the United States of America, the more robust steel-reeded German Melodians \"won out\" over these brass-reeded, soft, and delicate \"\"accordion melodiques\"\". French \"accordion\" manufactures nearly came to an end during the Franco-Prussian War 1870-71. From 1880 on, the Italian accordion makers took over a large share of the French market for accordions.\n\n\n"}

In 2013, its international network serves customers in more than 100 countries and employs approximately 134,000 people. Operations include approximately 1,100 facilities, and 13,300 vehicles. The company emerged from the Pittston Company and changed its name to the Brink's Company in 2003.\n\nBrink's is popularly known for its bullet-resistant armored trucks which carry money and valuable goods (once used to transport the Hope Diamond from an auction to the buyer's home). Brink's is a provider of security services to banks, retailers, governments, mints and jewelers. Founded in 1859 by Perry Brink of Chicago, Illinois, Brink's business evolved from local armored transportation services to providing corporate financial logistics and international secure transportation.\n\nIn 1962, Brink's was acquired by Pittston, a coal company. Burlington Air Express was acquired in 1982. Brink's Home Security was started in 1983. Pittston sold off its coal assets in the 2000s and renamed the company Brink's. The home security unit was also spun off.\n\nA significant portion of Brink's business is conducted internationally, with 82% of $3.9 billion in revenues earned outside the United States in 2013. The majority of Brink's consolidated revenues in 2013 was earned in operations located in nine countries, each contributing in excess of $100 million of revenues. The 2013 revenues from these countries totaled $3.0 billion or 79% of consolidated revenues. These operations, in declining order of revenues, were the U.S., France, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Canada, Colombia, Argentina and the Netherlands.\n\nIn January 2012, Brink's acquired Kheops, SAS, a provider of logistics software and related services in France, for approximately $17 million. This acquisition gave the company proprietary control of software used primarily in cash-in-transit and money processing operations in France.\n\nOn January 31, 2013, Brink's acquired Brazil-based Rede Transacoes Eletronicas Ltda. (\"Redetrel\") for approximately $26 million. Redetrel distributes electronic prepaid products, including mobile phone airtime, via a network of approximately 20,000 retail locations across Brazil. Redetrel's strong distribution network supplements Brink's existing payments business, ePago, which has operations in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Panama.\n\nBrink's sold one of its core operations, BAX Global, a shipping company for U.S. $1.1 billion to Deutsche Bahn on January 31, 2006. BAX Global used to be known as Burlington Air Express.\n\nIn November 2010, Brink's former cash-in-transit (CIT) operations in Belgium filed for bankruptcy, after local union employees rejected a restructuring plan, and was placed in bankruptcy on February 2, 2011. Brink's deconsolidated the Belgium subsidiary in 2010.\n\nIn 2012, Brink's agreed to sell its cash-in-transit operations in Germany and Poland, and event security operations in France, and the company completed the divestiture of its guarding operations in Morocco, in December 2012.\n\nIn May 2014, Brink's US decided to cease their cash-in-transit operations throughout Australia. Linfox Armaguard made an offer to purchase Brink's Australia's CIT operations, and Brink's is continuing their precious goods logistics business within Australia.\n\nBrink's had a business line in home security named Brink's Home Security which accounted for 15% of Brink's revenue in 2008; it decided that year to spin the business off into a separate publicly traded company in order to focus on its other businesses. The company rebranded as Broadview in 2009 with a massive advertising campaign. Broadview was acquired and merged into The ADT Corporation in 2010.\n\nIn 2018 Brink's re-entered the business through a trademark licensing deal, re-creating the Brink's Home Security brand.\n\nThe Great Brink's Robbery was an armed robbery of the Brinks Building at the corner of Prince St. and Commercial St. in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts, on the night of January 17, 1950. Led by Boston small-time criminal Tony \"Fats\" Pino, 11 men broke in and stole $1,218,211.29 in cash, and $1,557,183.83 in checks, money orders, and other securities. At the time, it was the largest robbery in the history of the United States. Skillfully executed with only a bare minimum of clues left at the crime scene, the robbery was billed as \"the crime of the century\".\n\nAll 11 members of the gang were later arrested, and all were paroled and released by 1971, except for Joseph \"Big Joe\" McGinnis, the originator of the heist, who died in prison. Despite ongoing efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local authorities, only $58,000 of the initial $2.7 million stolen was ever recovered.\n\nOn October 20, 1981, members of the Weather Underground Organization and Black Liberation Army attempted an armed robbery of a Brink's armored car in Nanuet, New York. The robbery resulted in a shootout that left two police officers, Edward O'Grady and Waverly Brown, and a Brink's security guard, Pete Paige, dead. Paige's partner, Joe Trombino, was severely wounded in the gun battle but survived. He later died in the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\nOn November 26, 1983, there was an armed robbery at a warehouse near London's Heathrow Airport, operated by Brink's-Mat, a former joint venture between Brink's and the London-based company MAT Transport, which specialized in the transportation of valuable goods. Three tonnes of gold bullion (worth £26 million) was stolen. Most of the gold has never been recovered.\n\n$7.4 million was stolen from the Brink's Armored Car Depot in Rochester, New York, the fifth largest robbery in US history. Four men, Sam Millar, Patrick Moloney, former Rochester Police officer Thomas O'Connor, and Charles McCormick, all of whom had ties to the Provisional Irish Republican Army, were accused.\n\nOn September 30, 2008, in Monroe, Washington, a Brinks Armored Car pulled up to make a delivery to the Bank of America. A landscaper, who was working the grounds and wearing a blue shirt, blue hat, and yellow safety vest, approached the armored car guard, pepper-sprayed him, stole $400,000 in cash, and escaped on an inner tube. When police arrived, they found the bank's parking lot was full of men wearing clothing identical to the mysterious robber's. All were \"hired\" by a phony ad, placed on Craigslist by a culprit the media dubbed \"D.B. Tuber\" (after famed hi-jacker, D. B. Cooper), instructing them to show up at the bank at the same time, wearing a blue shirt, blue hat, and yellow safety vest. Months later, the FBI received a tip from a very attentive homeless man who had witnessed a \"practice run\" weeks prior to the robbery. DNA evidence later convicted former college football player Anthony Curcio of the crime.\n\nOn 18 February 2013, eight masked gunmen, in two cars with police markings, stole approximately €38 million worth of diamonds by attacking in a very small time window during which they were being transferred from a Brink's armored van to a Swiss-bound Fokker 100 operated by Helvetic Airways. The Fokker 100 was on the apron at Brussels Airport, Belgium, just before 20:00 CET. The heist was accomplished without a shot being fired.\n\nIn May 2014, California resident Joe Cornell found a Brink's bag with $125,000 inside; Cornell saw the bag of cash accidentally fall out of the back of a Brink's transport car as it drove over the railroad tracks in downtown Fresno. Cornell returned the bag of cash claiming, \"it was the right thing to do.\" Brinks thanked the man for his honesty with a $5,000 reward and a $5,000 donation in Cornell's name to the Salvation Army, where he works.\n\nIn October 2015, Brink's activist investor Starboard Value LP announced it had raised its stake in the company to around 12.4%. Later that year, Brink's responded to Texas RFI 212P with their perspective on a solution for Texas HB 483, establishing the Texas Bullion Depository.\n\nIn April 2017, it was announced that Brinks had chosen the FN Herstal FN 509 9mm to be the new sidearm for their armed guards.\n\nIn August 2018, Brinks Inc. acquired Dunbar Armored for $520 Million.\n 7.

{"id": "2274234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274234", "title": "Alex Pettyfer", "text": "Alex Pettyfer\n\nAlexander Richard Pettyfer (born 10 April 1990) is a British actor and model. He appeared in school plays and on television before being cast as Alex Rider, the main character in the 2006 film version of \"Stormbreaker\". Pettyfer was nominated for a Young Artist Award and an Empire Award for his role.\n\nHe has been seen as a model in several advertising campaigns for Burberry and has starred in a number of other films, including \"I Am Number Four,\" \"Beastly\", and \"Magic Mike\". He starred as Brody in the Netflix science fiction miniseries \"The I-Land\".\n\nPettyfer was born in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England, the son of Lee Robinson, an actress and Richard Pettyfer, an actor. Both parents met while performing in London's West End in \"West Side Story\", \"Cats\" and \"Miss Saigon\". He has a younger half-brother, James Ireland, a professional tennis player and regional coach, from his mother's remarriage to Michael J. Ireland, a retired builder and property developer.\n\nPettyfer was brought up in Esher and then Windsor, Berkshire and began his career initially being managed by his mother as a young fashion model at the age of seven, for Gap, after meeting Ralph Lauren in a toy store in New York. He also did advertisements for some yogurt brands. His first commercial was at age six.\n\nAs a schoolboy, he performed in plays, including in the role of Willy Wonka in a production of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", Jack in his school play \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" and Robin Hood in the adaptation of \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). Pettyfer was educated at two junior independent schools: The Mall School, a small school in Twickenham, followed by the Lambrook Haileybury school in Winkfield, Berkshire. He subsequently attended two other independent boarding schools: Millfield School in Street, Somerset and Shiplake College near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. Before his GCSEs, he left Shiplake College to attend the independent Sylvia Young Theatre School in London.\n\nIn 2005, Pettyfer made his professional acting début in the British television production of \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\", playing the lead character, Tom Brown; he received positive reviews for the role. In June 2005, he was cast in his most prominent role so far, that of teenage MI6 spy Alex Rider in the film \"Stormbreaker\", based on the novel by Anthony Horowitz. He was one of 500 who auditioned for the role. Pettyfer chose to appear in the film over a role in the film \"Eragon\", noting that he preferred \"Stormbreaker\" because it would be filmed in Britain, in the Isle of Man, while \"Eragon\" would film in Hungary; Pettyfer has a fear of flying, and he liked the looks of the cast for \"Stormbreaker\". \"Stormbreaker\" was released on 21 July 2006 in the United Kingdom, on 6 October 2006 in the United States and on 21 September 2006 in Australia.\n\nOne review of Pettyfer's performance described him as playing the role with an \"earnest intensity\", although another noted that he \"isn't quite at ease as an actor\". Media reports specified that the film was expected to make Pettyfer a \"teen idol\". In September 2006, it was reported that Pettyfer would not reprise the role if there was another Alex Rider film because he had become too mature for the role.\n\nAt around age 17, because of his earlier acting success and to supplement his income, Pettyfer started modelling, notably in some advertising campaigns for Burberry.\n\nHe next appeared in \"Wild Child\", a film set in California, Kent and Yorkshire part of which took place at Cobham Hall Girls' School in Kent. He played schoolboy Freddie Kingsley and he co-starred with Emma Roberts. In 2009, he played the callous ringleader of a group of cool but cruel teenagers who are picked off one by one by the ghost of one of their former victims, in the horror-comedy, \"Tormented\".\n\nHe starred in the film \"Beastly\", based on the novel by Alex Flinn, alongside Mary-Kate Olsen, Vanessa Hudgens and Neil Patrick Harris. He finished filming on 13 August 2009, and the film was released on 4 March 2011. Pettyfer portrayed the main character in \"I Am Number Four\", released in February 2011. The film co-starred Timothy Olyphant, Dianna Agron and Teresa Palmer, and was directed by D.J. Caruso, produced by Michael Bay and executive produced by Steven Spielberg.\n\nHe was offered the part of Jace Wayland in the upcoming portrayal of Cassandra Clare's best selling book, \"City of Bones\". Jamie Campbell Bower was later cast as Jace Wayland. Pettyfer had also been offered a part in an upcoming film adaption of Joseph Delaney's \"The Wardstone Chronicles\", but he declined the role. He was in line to star in \"The Paperboy\", based on the Pete Dexter novel of the same name, but was dropped for the role (filled by Zac Efron). In 2012 he played Adam, a 19-year-old who enters the world of male stripping in \"Magic Mike\".\n\nIn 2013, Pettyfer had a small role as Thomas Westfall in \"The Butler\". In 2014, he starred in the romantic drama \"Endless Love\" alongside actress Gabriella Wilde, where they play love interests. In 2016, Pettyfer played the role of Jerry Schilling in the biography film \"Elvis & Nixon\" alongside Kevin Spacey and Michael Shannon. In 2017, he starred as Nick in the indie thriller \"The Strange Ones\" directed by Christopher Radcliff and Lauren Wolkstein. Pettyfer and his producing partner Craig Robinson launched Upturn Productions in 2015 with the intent of securing literary works that could be made into film or television. In 2017, \"Back Roads,\" based on the book of the same name by Tawni O'Dell, was their first independent film produced under the Upturn banner. Pettyfer made it his directorial debut and also played the lead role of Harley Altmyer.\n\nIn 2018, Pettyfer starred as Stephen Underwood, a journalist who uncovers the horrific murder of 22,000 Poles under Stalin's instructions, in the post–World War II thriller \"The Last Witness\". In the same year, it was announced that Pettyfer had been cast in the main role of Brody on the Netflix science fiction miniseries \"The I-Land\". The miniseries was released on 12 September 2019.\n\nIn June 2009, Pettyfer was voted number 35 on British women's magazine \"Company's\" list of the top 50 most eligible bachelors. In August 2009, the British magazine \"Glamour\" ranked him number 21 on their list of the sexiest men on the planet.\n\nAfter Pettyfer completed filming \"Stormbreaker\", he did not discuss the film with anyone at his school, citing the advice of his \"Stormbreaker\" star Ewan McGregor, who told him to keep his personal and professional lives separate. Pettyfer subsequently decided to leave school without any qualifications and concentrate on his film career, saying that \"When you have already experienced going out and working in the real world, and you come back to school, you just see it as a playground and you don't want to be there any more\".\n\nPettyfer was briefly engaged to Elvis Presley's granddaughter, the actress Riley Keough, in 2012. They met on the set of their film, \"Magic Mike\".\n\nPettyfer has seven tattoos, including a Celtic cross on his chest, Tibetan script on the inside of his right arm, the words \"What Goes Around Comes Around\" on his right shoulder, a Katakana script on his lower waist, and the letters \"ER,\" the initials of ex-girlfriend Emma Roberts inside interlinking hearts on his right wrist. When Contactmusic asked him about the \"ER\" tattoo he said \"I don't know how to say it, she's a lovely, lovely girl, we had a spell of something that is over now, but we're on good terms. She's beautiful, she's great; we're really good friends.\" The actor had Roberts' name tattooed on his wrist while the two were dating. \"I'm going to get asked about this, aren't I? I thought it was just between me and her,\" he said when asked about the tattoo.\n\nIn a 2011 interview, he stated \"I felt like the industry was just a factory. You hear a lot of people say they want to make art in this industry, but so few people actually fucking do it. I was disillusioned by Hollywood at the time, but now I've come to accept that's just the way things are: it's called show business, not show art.\"\n\nIn the same interview, when asked about how he liked living in Los Angeles, he stated, \"LA is growing on me a little bit, but it's still a shit-hole. I think it's this insidious pool where nearly everyone lives in fear. Geographically it's fantastic: in a half hour, you can be on the beach in one direction, go snowboarding in another, or go out into the desert. But socially it's disgusting. I wish they'd just run all the cunts out.\"\n\nOn 24 December 2019, he became engaged to German model Toni Garrn after ten months of dating.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2274247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274247", "title": "Psittacosaurus", "text": "Psittacosaurus\n\nPsittacosaurus ( ; \"parrot lizard\") is a genus of extinct ceratopsian dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of what is now Asia, existing between 126 and 101 million years ago. It is notable for being the most species-rich dinosaur genus. Up to 12 species are known, from across China, Mongolia, Siberia, and possibly Thailand and Laos. The species of \"Psittacosaurus\" were obligate bipeds at adulthood, with a high skull and a robust beak. One individual was found preserved with long filaments on the tail, similar to those of \"Tianyulong\", and scales across the rest of the animal. \"Psittacosaurus\" probably had complex behaviours, based on the proportions and relative size of the brain. It may have been active for short periods of time during the day and night, and had well-developed senses of smell and vision.\n\n\"Psittacosaurus\" was one of the earliest ceratopsians, but closer to \"Triceratops\" than \"Yinlong\". Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like \"Hongshanosaurus\", it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter and an early offshoot of the branch that led to more derived forms. The genera closely related to \"Psittacosaurus\" are all from Asia, with the exception of \"Aquilops\", from North America. The first species was either \"P. lujiatunensis\" or closely related, and it may have given rise to later forms of \"Psittacosaurus\".\n\n\"Psittacosaurus\" is one of the most completely known dinosaur genera. Fossils of hundreds of individuals have been collected so far, including many complete skeletons. Most age classes are represented, from hatchling through to adult, which has allowed several detailed studies of \"Psittacosaurus\" growth rates and reproductive biology. The abundance of this dinosaur in the fossil record has led to the labelling of Lower Cretaceous sediments of east Asia the \"Psittacosaurus\" biochron.\n\nThe species of \"Psittacosaurus\" vary in size and specific features of the skull and skeleton, but share the same overall body shape. The best-known—\"P. mongoliensis\"—can reach 2 metres (6.5 ft) in length. The maximum adult body weight was most likely over 20 kilogrammes (44 lb) in \"P. mongoliensis\". Several species approach \"P. mongoliensis\" in size (\"P. lujiatunensis\", \"P. neimongoliensis\", \"P. xinjiangensis\"), while others are somewhat smaller (\"P. sinensis\", \"P. meileyingensis\"). The smallest known species, \"P. ordosensis\", is 30% smaller than \"P. mongoliensis\". The largest are \"P. lujiatunensis\" and \"P. sibiricus\", although neither is significantly larger than \"P. mongoliensis\". \"Psittacosaurus\" postcranial skeletons are more typical of a 'generic' bipedal ornithischian. There are only four digits on the manus ('hand'), as opposed to the five found in most other ornithischians (including all other ceratopsians), while the four-toed hindfoot is very similar to many other small ornithischians.\n\nThe skull of \"Psittacosaurus\" is highly modified compared to other ornithischian dinosaurs of its time. Extremely tall in height and short in length, the skull has an almost round profile in some species. The portion in front of the orbit (eye socket) is only 40% of total skull length, shorter than any other known ornithischian. The lower jaws of psittacosaurs are characterised by a bulbous vertical ridge down the centre of each tooth. Both upper and lower jaws sport a pronounced beak, formed from the \"rostral\" and \"predentary\" bones, respectively. The bony core of the beak may have been sheathed in keratin to provide a sharp cutting surface for cropping plant material. As the generic name suggests, the short skull and beak superficially resemble those of modern parrots. \"Psittacosaurus\" skulls share several adaptations with more derived ceratopsians, such as the unique rostral bone at the tip of the upper jaw, and the flared jugal (cheek) bones. There is still no sign of the bony neck frill or prominent facial horns which would develop in later ceratopsians. Bony horns protrude from the skull of \"P. sibiricus\", but these are thought to be an example of convergent evolution.\n\nThe integument, or body covering, of \"Psittacosaurus\" is known from a Chinese specimen, which most likely comes from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, China. The specimen, which is not yet assigned to any particular species, was illegally exported from China, in violation of Chinese law, but was purchased by the Senckenberg Museum in Germany. It was described while awaiting repatriation.\n\nMost of the body was covered in scales. Larger scales were arranged in irregular patterns, with numerous smaller scales occupying the spaces between them, similarly to skin impressions known from other ceratopsians, such as \"Chasmosaurus\". A series of what appear to be hollow, tubular bristle-like structures, approximately long, were also preserved, arranged in a row down the dorsal (upper) surface of the tail. These were confirmed by the authors, as well as an independent scientist, to not represent plant material. The bristle-like integumentary structures extend into the skin nearly to the vertebrae, and were likely circular or tubular before being preserved. Under ultraviolet light, they gave off the same fluorescence as scales, providing the possibility they were keratinized. The study stated that, \"at present, there is no convincing evidence which shows these structures to be homologous to the structurally different integumentary filaments of theropod dinosaurs\". However, they found that all other feather-like integument from the Yixian Formation could be identified as feathers.\n\nIn 2008, another study was published describing the integument and dermis of \"Psittacosaurus\" sp., from a different specimen. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in \"Psittacosaurus\" are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.\nAs described in a 2016 study, examination of melanosomes preserved in the specimen of \"Psittacosaurus\" preserved with integument indicated that the animal was countershaded, likely related to living in a dense forest habitat with little light, much like many modern species of forest-dwelling deer and antelope; stripes and spots on the limbs may represent disruptive coloration. The specimen also had dense clusters of pigment on its shoulders, face (possibly for display), and cloaca (which may have had an antimicrobial function), as well as large patagia on its hind legs that connected to the base of the tail. Its large eyes indicate that it also likely had good vision, which would have been useful in finding food or avoiding predators. The authors pointed out that there might have been variation in coloration across the range of the animal, depending on differences in the light environment. The authors were unable to determine which species of Jehol Formation \"Psittacosaurus\" the specimen belonged to due to the way the skull is preserved, but ruled out \"P. mongoliensis\", based on hip features.\n\nAnother 2016 study used laser-stimulated fluorescence imaging to analyze the internal structure of the bristles. The highly cornified bristles were arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being most similar to the quills of \"Tianyulong\", and the sparsely distributed elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of \"Beipiaosaurus\". Similar, non-feather-derived bristles are found in a few extant birds such as the \"horn\" on the horned screamer and the \"beards\" of turkeys; these structures differ from feathers in that they are unbranched, heavily cornified and do not develop from a follicle, but instead arise from discrete cell populations that exhibit continuous growth. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a skin flap.\n\nSkulls of \"P. mongoliensis\" are flat on top, especially over the back of the skull, with a triangular depression, the antorbital fossa, on the outside surface of the maxilla (an upper jaw bone). A flange is present on the lower edge of the dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw), although it is not as prominent as in \"P. meileyingensis\" or \"P. major\" (=\"P. lujiatunensis\"). \"P. mongoliensis\" is among the largest known species. The skull of the type specimen, which is probably a juvenile, is 15.2 centimetres (6 in) long, and the associated femur is 16.2 centimetres (6.4 in) in length. Other specimens are larger, with the largest documented femur measuring about 21 centimetres (8.25 in) long.\n\n\"P. sinensis\" is readily distinguished from all other species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of \"P. mongoliensis\" and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (cheek) bone on the outside of the skull. The jugals flare out sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally wider than in any other known \"Psittacosaurus\" species except \"P. sibiricus\" and \"P. lujiatunensis\". Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the eye, at the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in \"P. sibiricus\". The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or \"fenestra\", seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an underbite. The skull of an adult \"P. sinensis\" can reach 11.5 centimeters (4.5 in) in length.\n\n\"P. sibiricus\" is the largest-known species of \"Psittacosaurus\". The skull of the type specimen is 20.7 centimetres long (8.25 in), and the femur is 22.3 cm (8.75 in) in length. It is also distinguished by its neck frill, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of \"P. sibiricus\" is the number of 'horns' around the eyes, with three prominences on each postorbital, and one in front of each eye, on the palpebral bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of \"P. sinensis\" are not as pronounced but may be homologous. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related \"P. sinensis\". There is a flange on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to \"P. mongoliensis\", \"P. meileyingensis\", and \"P. sattayaraki\". It can be told apart from the other species of \"Psittacosaurus\" by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. Most of these are skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.\n\n\"P. xinjiangensis\" is distinguished by a prominent jugal 'horn' that is flattened on the front end, as well as some features of the teeth. The ilium, one of the three bones of the pelvis, also bears a characteristically long bony process behind the acetabulum (hip socket). An adult femur has a published length of about 16 centimetres (6.3 in). \"P. meileyingensis\" has the shortest snout and neck frill of any species, making the skull nearly circular in profile. The orbit (eye socket) is roughly triangular, and there is a prominent flange on the lower edge of the dentary, a feature also seen in specimens of \"P. lujiatunensis\", and to a lesser degree in \"P. mongoliensis\", \"P. sattayaraki\", and \"P. sibiricus\". The complete type skull, probably adult, is 13.7 centimetres (5.5 in) long. The dentary of \"P. sattayaraki\" has a flange similar to that found in \"P. mongoliensis\", \"P. sibiricus\", \"P. lujiatunensis\" and \"P. meileyingensis\", although it is less pronounced than in those species. The material appears to be roughly the same size as \"P. sinensis\". The frontal bone of \"P. neimongoliensis\" is distinctly narrow compared to that of other species, resulting in a narrower skull overall. The ischium bone of the pelvis is also longer than the femur, which differs from other species in which these bones are known. The type specimen has a skull length of 13.2 centimetres (5.2 in) and a femoral length of 13 centimetres (5.1 in), but is not fully grown. An adult \"P. neimongoliensis\" was probably smaller than \"P. mongoliensis\", with a proportionately longer skull and tail. \"P. ordosensis\" can be distinguished by numerous features of the jugals, which have very prominent 'horns'. It is also the smallest known species. One adult skull measures only 9.5 centimeters (3.75 in) in length.\n\nThe type skull of \"P. lujiatunensis\" measures 19 cm (7.5 in) in length, while the largest-known skull is 20.5 centimetres (8 in) long, so this species was similar in size to \"P. mongoliensis\" and \"P. sibiricus\". There is a fossa in front of the eye, as in \"P. mongoliensis\". The jugal bones flare outwards widely, making the skull wider than it is long, as seen in \"P. sinensis\". Widely flared jugals are also found in \"P. sibiricus\". Overall, this species is thought to exhibit several primitive characteristics compared to other species of \"Psittacosaurus\", which is consistent with its greater geological age. \"P. gobiensis\" was small-bodied ( long) and differs from other species of \"Psittacosaurus\" by \"significant, but structurally minor, details.\" These include the presence of a pyramidal horn on the postorbital, a depression on the postorbital-jugal contact, and enamel thickness. \"P. mongoliensis\" was a contemporary.\n\n\"Psittacosaurus\" was first described as a genus in 1923, by Henry Fairfield Osborn. He named the type species \"P. mongoliensis\", for the location of its discovery in Mongolia, placing it in the new family Psittacosauridae. Remains of this dinosaur were first discovered the year before, on the third American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, when one of the expedition's drivers, Wong, found the type specimen (AMNH 6254), which preserves a nearly complete skull, as well as a post cranial skeleton lacking sections of the limbs. This same expedition turned up the remains of many other famous Mongolian dinosaurs, including \"Protoceratops\", \"Oviraptor\", and \"Velociraptor\". Many later expeditions by various combinations of Mongolian, Russian, Chinese, American, Polish, Japanese, and Canadian paleontologists also recovered specimens from throughout Mongolia and northern China. In these areas, \"Psittacosaurus mongoliensis\" fossils are found in most sedimentary strata dating to the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 125 to 100 mya. Fossil remains of over 75 individuals have been recovered, including nearly 20 complete skeletons with skulls. Individuals of all ages are known, from hatchlings less than long, to very old adults reaching nearly in length.\n\nWhen describing \"Psittacosaurus mongoliensis\" in 1923, Osborn also gave the name \"Protiguanodon mongoliense\" to another skeleton found nearby, believing it to represent an ancestor of the ornithopod \"Iguanodon\", in the new subfamily Protiguanodontinae. \"Protiguanodon mongoliense\", AMNH 6523, measured long, and was known from much of the skeleton, although at the time of description the neck vertebrae were still covered by matrix. Osborn diagnosed his taxa on the basis of features of the teeth and snout. However, modern taxonomists find these features insignificant, instead placing \"Protiguanodon mongoliense\" within \"Psittacosaurus mongoliensis\". When the skeleton was prepared further, it became clear that it was nearly identical to \"Psittacosaurus mongoliensis\". In 1958, Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian (better known as C. C. Young) renamed the skeleton \"Psittacosaurus protiguanodonensis\". Today the specimen is generally referred to as the species \"Psittacosaurus mongoliensis\" and the names \"Protiguanodon mongoliense\" and \"Psittacosaurus protiguanodonensis\" are considered junior synonyms of the name \"Psittacosaurus mongoliensis\", which was coined first.\n\nIn 1931, C. C. Young named a new species of \"Psittacosaurus\" for a partial skull discovered in Inner Mongolia, China. The skull was named \"P. osborni\" after Henry Fairfield Osborn. The validity of this species is now considered equivocal. Sereno (1990) considered it a synonym of \"P. mongoliensis\", which is found in nearby strata of the same age. You and Dodson (2004) listed it as valid in a table, but not in their text. In a 2010 review, Sereno again regarded \"P. osborni\" as a synonym of \"P. mongoliensis\", but noted it was tentative because of the presence of multiple valid psittacosaur species in Inner Mongolia. Young also described the species \"P. tingi\" in the same 1931 report which contained \"P. osborni\". It is based on several skull fragments. He later synonymised the two species under the name \"P. osborni\". You and Dodson (2004) followed this in a table, but Sereno regarded both species as synonyms of \"P. mongoliensis\"; a table in the latter reported \"P. tingi\" as a \"nomen dubium\", however. The front half of a skull from Guyang County in Inner Mongolia was described as \"Psittacosaurus guyangensis\" in 1983. Disarticulated postcranial remains representing multiple individuals were found at the same locality and were assigned to the species. While it differs from the type specimen of \"P. mongoliensis\", it falls within the range of individual variation seen in other specimens of that species and is no longer recognised as a valid species. You and Dodson (2004) included \"P. guyangensis\" in a table of valid taxa, but did not include it as such in their text.\n\nSeventeen species have been referred to the genus \"Psittacosaurus\", although only nine to eleven are considered valid today. This is the highest number of valid species currently assigned to any single dinosaur genus (not including birds). In contrast, most other dinosaur genera are monospecific, containing only a single known species. The difference is most likely due to artifacts of the fossilisation process. While \"Psittacosaurus\" is known from hundreds of fossil specimens, most other dinosaur species are known from far fewer, and many are represented by only a single specimen. With a very high sample size, the diversity of \"Psittacosaurus\" can be analysed more completely than that of most dinosaur genera, resulting in the recognition of more species. Most extant animal genera are represented by multiple species, suggesting that this may have been the case for extinct dinosaur genera as well, although most of these species may not have been preserved. In addition, most dinosaurs are known solely from bones and can only be evaluated from a morphological standpoint, whereas extant species often have very similar skeletal morphology but differ in other ways which would not normally be preserved in the fossil record, such as behaviour, or colouration. Therefore, actual species diversity may be much higher than currently recognised in this and other dinosaur genera. As some species are known only from skull material, species of \"Psittacosaurus\" are primarily distinguished by features of the skull and teeth. Several species can be recognised by features of the pelvis as well.\n\nIn the 1950s, a new Chinese species of \"Psittacosaurus\" was found in the Aptian-Albian Qingshan Formation of Shandong Province, southeast of Beijing. C. C. Young called it \"P. sinensis\" to differentiate it from \"P. mongoliensis\", which had originally been found in Mongolia. Fossils of more than twenty individuals have since been recovered, including several complete skulls and skeletons, making this the most well-known species after \"P. mongoliensis\". Chinese paleontologist Zhao Xijin named a new species after his mentor, C. C. Young, in 1962. However, the type specimen of \"P. youngi\" (a partial skeleton and skull) was discovered in the same rocks as \"P. sinensis\" and appears to be very similar, so \"P. youngi\" is generally considered a junior synonym of that better-known species. As with \"P. guyangensis\" and \"P. osborni\", You and Dodson (2004) listed it as valid in a table, but not in their text.\n\nIn 1988, Zhao and American paleontologist Paul Sereno described \"P. xinjiangensis\", named after the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in which it was discovered. Several individuals of different ages were discovered in the early 1970s by Chinese paleontologists and described by Sereno and Zhao, although the holotype and most complete skeleton belonged to a juvenile. An adult skeleton was later discovered at a different locality in Xinjiang. These specimens come from the upper part of the Tugulu Group, which is regarded as Aptian-Albian in age.\n\n\nA second species described in 1988 by Sereno and Zhao, along with two Chinese colleagues, was \"P. meileyingensis\" from the Jiufotang Formation, near the town of Meileyingzi, Liaoning Province, northeastern China. This species is known from four fossil skulls, one associated with some skeletal material, found in 1973 by Chinese scientists. The age of the Jiufotang in Liaoning is unknown, but in the neighbouring province of Inner Mongolia, it has been dated to about 110 Ma, in the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous.\n\nFrench paleontologist Eric Buffetaut and a Thai colleague, Varavudh Suteethorn, described a partial upper and lower jaw from the Aptian-Albian Khok Kruat Formation of Thailand in 1992, giving it the name \"P. sattayaraki\". In 2000, Sereno questioned the validity of this species, citing its eroded and fragmentary nature, and noted an absence of features characteristic of the genus \"Psittacosaurus\". However, in 2002 the original authors published new images of the fossil which seem to show teeth in the lower jaw that exhibit the bulbous vertical ridge characteristic of psittacosaurs. Other authors have also defended its validity, while some continue to regard it as dubious. Sereno (2010) proposed that the best assignment for the type material may be Ceratopsia \"incertae sedis\".\n\nTwo new species of \"Psittacosaurus\" were described by Canadian Dale Russell and Zhao in 1996. The first was named \"P. neimongoliensis\", after the Mandarin Chinese name for Inner Mongolia. It is based on a nearly complete fossil skeleton, including most of the skull, found in the Early Cretaceous Ejinhoro Formation with seven other individuals. Russell and Zhao also named \"P. ordosensis\" in 1996, after the Ordos prefecture of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The type specimen is a nearly complete skeleton, including part of the skull. However, only the skull, lower jaw, and foot have been described. Three other specimens were referred to this species but remain undescribed. Like \"P. neimongoliensis\", this species was discovered in the Eijnhoro Formation. Sereno (2010) found the species as described to be indistinguishable from \"P. sinensis\", another small species, but suggested that additional study of \"P. ordosensis\" might reveal diagnostic features. He provisionally designated \"P. ordosensis\" a \"nomen dubium\".\n\nXu Xing, another Chinese paleontologist, named a new species of \"Psittacosaurus\" in 1997, based on a complete skull with associated vertebrae and a forelimb. This material was recovered in Gansu Province, near the border with Inner Mongolia. This species is named \"P. mazongshanensis\" after the nearby mountain called Mazongshan (Horse Mane Mountain) and has been described in a preliminary manner. Unfortunately, the skull was damaged while in the care of the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), and several fragments have been lost, including all of the teeth. The remains were found in the Lower Xinminbao Formation, which have not been precisely dated, although there is some evidence that they were deposited in the late Barremian through Aptian stages. Sereno suggested in 2000 that \"P. mazongshanensis\" was a \"nomen dubium\", with no unique features that separate it from any other species of \"Psittacosaurus\". However, more recent authors have noted that it can be distinguished by its proportionally long snout compared to other species of \"Psittacosaurus\", as well as a prominent bony protuberance, pointing outwards and downwards, on the maxilla of the upper jaw. The maxillary protuberance is also now missing. Other features originally used to distinguish the species have been recognised as the results of the deformation of the skull after fossilisation. Sereno (2010) remained unconvinced of its validity.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Russian paleontologists began excavating \"Psittacosaurus\" remains at a locality near the village of Shestakovo in the oblast of Kemerovo in Siberia. Two other nearby localities were explored in the 1990s, one of which produced several complete skeletons. This species was named \"P. sibiricus\" in 2000 in a scientific paper written by five Russian paleontologists, but credit for the name is officially given to two of those authors, Alexei Voronkevich and Alexander Averianov. The remains were not completely described until 2006. Two nearly complete, articulated skeletons and a variety of disarticulated material from other individuals of all ages are known from the Ilek Formation of Siberia, which ranges from the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous.\n\n\"P. lujiatunensis\", named in 2006 by Chinese paleontologist Zhou Chang-Fu and three Chinese colleagues, is one of the oldest-known species, based on four skulls from the lower beds of Yixian Formation, near the village of Lujiatun. While this bed has been dated differently by different authors, from 128 Ma in the Barremian stage, to 125 Ma in the earliest Aptian, revised dating methods have shown them to be about 123 million years old. \"P. lujiatunensis\" was contemporaneous with another psittacosaurid species, \"Hongshanosaurus houi\", which was found in the same beds. It is potentially synonymous with \"H. houi\"; Sereno (2010), who proposed that \"Hongshanosaurus\" is a synonym of \"Psittacosaurus\", opted to leave \"P. lujiatunensis\" and \"H. houi\" separate species due to the inadequacies of the latter's type specimen.\n\nOne nearly complete skeleton of \"P. lujiatunensis\" from the same lower beds of the Yixian Formation had previously been classified in its own species, \"Psittacosaurus major\", named for the large size of its skull by Sereno, Zhao and two colleagues in 2007. You and colleagues described an additional specimen and concurred that it was distinct from \"P. lujiatunensis\". \"P. major\" was originally characterised by a proportionately large skull, which was 39% of the length of its torso, compared to 30% in \"P. mongoliensis\", and other features. However, a 2013 study utilising morphometric analysis showed that the supposed differences between \"P. lujiatunensis\" and \"P. major\" were due to differences in preservation and crushing. The study concluded that both represented a single species.\n\nA third species of Lujiatun psittacosaur, the first to be named, was described as \"Hongshanosaurus houi\" in 2003. The generic name \"Hongshanosaurus\" was derived from the Mandarin Chinese words 紅 (\"hóng\": \"red\") and 山 (\"shān\": \"hill\"), as well as the Greek word \"sauros\" (\"lizard\"). This name refers to the ancient Hongshan culture of northeastern China, who lived in the same general area in which the fossil skull of \"Hongshanosaurus\" was found. The type and only named species, \"H. houi\", honours Hou Lianhai, a professor at the IVPP in Beijing, who curated the specimen. Genus and species were both named by Chinese paleontologists You Hailu, Xu Xing, and Wang Xiaolin in 2003. Sereno (2010) regarded its distinct proportions as due to crushing and compression of the \"Hongshanosaurus\" skulls. He regarded \"Hongshanosaurus\" as a junior synonym of \"Psittacosaurus\", and potentially the same as \"P. lujiatunensis\". He did not synonymise the two species because of difficulties with the holotype skull of \"H. houi\", instead considering new combination \"P. houi\" a \"nomen dubium\" within \"Psittacosaurus\". Sereno's hypothesis was supported by a morphometric study in 2013, which found \"P. houi\" and \"P. lujiatunensis\" to be synonymous. While \"P. houi\" is the oldest available name, the researchers argued that because the type specimen of \"P. lujiatunensis\" was better preserved, the correct name for this species should be \"P. lujiatunensis\" rather than \"P. houi\", which would normally have priority.\n\n\"P. gobiensis\" is named for the region it was found in 2001, and first described by Sereno, Zhao and Lin in 2010. It is known from a skull and partial articulated skeleton with gastroliths. Many other specimens either cannot be determined to belong to any particular species, or have not yet been assigned to one. These specimens are generally all referred to as \"Psittacosaurus\" sp., although it is not assumed that they belong to the same species. More than 200 specimens of \"Psittacosaurus\" have been found in the Yixian Formation, which is famous for its fossils of feathered dinosaurs. The vast majority of these have not been assigned to any published species, although many are very well preserved and some have already been partially described. Nearly 100 \"Psittacosaurus\" skeletons were excavated in Mongolia during the summers of 2005 and 2006 by a team led by Mongolian paleontologist Bolortsetseg Minjin and American Jack Horner from the Museum of the Rockies in Montana. Although only \"P. mongoliensis\" has been described from Mongolia so far, these specimens are still in preparation and have not yet been assigned to a species.\n\n\"Psittacosaurus\" is the type genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except \"Yinlong\" and perhaps the Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, \"Psittacosaurus\" itself was probably not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of \"Psittacosaurus\" had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the \"antorbital fenestra\", an opening in the skull between the eye socket and nostril, was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.\n\nIn 2014, the describers of a new taxon of basal ceratopsian published a phylogenetic analysis encompassing \"Psittacosaurus\". The below cladogram is from their analysis, placing the genus as one of the most primitive ceratopsians. The authors (Farke \"et al.\") noted that all taxa outside of Leptoceratopsidae and Coronosauria with the exception of their genus \"Aquilops\" are from Asia, meaning the group likely originated there.\n\nAlthough many species of \"Psittacosaurus\" have been named, their relationships to each other have not yet been fully explored and no scientific consensus exists on the subject. Several phylogenetic analyses have been published, with the most detailed being those by Alexander Averianov and colleagues in 2006, Hai-Lu You and colleagues in 2008, and Paul Sereno in 2010. The middle one is shown below.\n\nIn 2005, Zhou and colleagues suggested that \"P. lujiatunensis\" is basal to all other species. This would be consistent with its earlier appearance in the fossil record.\n\nThe brain of \"P. lujiatunensis\" is well known; a study on the anatomy and functionality of three specimens was published in 2007. Until the study, it was generally thought the brain of \"Psittacosaurus\" would have been similar to other ceratopsians with low Encephalisation Quotients. Russell and Zhao (1996) believed \"the small brain size of psittacosaurs implies a very restrictive behavioural repertoire relative to that of modern mammals of similar body size\". However, the 2007 study dispelled this theory when it found the brain to be more advanced. There is generally negative allometry for brain size with development in vertebrates, but this was shown not to be true in \"Psittacosaurus\". The EQ score for \"P. lujiatunensis\" is 0.31, significantly higher than genera such as \"Triceratops\". A higher EQ correlates with more complex behaviour, and various dinosaurs have high EQs, similar to birds, which range from 0.36 to 2.98. Thus, \"Psittacosaurus\" behaviour could have been as complex as that in \"Tyrannosaurus\", whose EQ ranges from 0.30 to 0.38. Behaviours influenced by high EQs include nest-building, parental care, and bird-like sleeping, some of which have been shown to be present in \"Psittacosaurus\".\n\nThe senses of \"Psittacosaurus\" can be inferred from the endocast. Large olfactory bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show the size of the eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in \"Psittacosaurus\", with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they are similar to those of \"Protoceratops\", \"Psittacosaurus\" would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in \"Psittacosaurus\" show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of \"Psittacosaurus\" and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.\n\nFord and Martin (2010) proposed that \"Psittacosaurus\" was semi-aquatic, swimming with its tail like a crocodile, and paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; the position of the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of \"Psittacosaurus\" were more terrestrial than others.\n\nPsittacosaurs had self-sharpening teeth that would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a gizzard, as in modern birds.\n\nUnlike many other dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: that is to say, the upper and lower jaws each behaved as a single unit, without internal joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could slide their lower jaws forward and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action. Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened. If the jaws were aligned, the beaks could be used to crop objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, the jaws may have served a nutcracking function. A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.\n\nStudies by Phil Senter in 2007 conducted on \"P. neimongoliensis\" and \"P. mongoliensis\" concluded that the forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other \"Psittacosaurus\" species) were too short (only about 58% as long as the hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that \"Psittacosaurus\" was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if \"Psittacosaurus\" needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, \"Psittacosaurus\" could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.\n\nHowever, \"Psittacosaurus\" may not have been entirely bipedal for its entire lifespan. Taking sections from the limb bones of 16 specimens of \"Psittacosaurus\", ranging in age from less than a year old to ten-year-old adults, Qi Zhao from the University of Bristol found that \"Psittacosaurus\" was probably secondarily bipedal. The infants' front limbs grew at faster rates than the hind limbs at between birth and three years of age. At the age of between four and six years, arm growth slowed and leg growth accelerated as the animal became mature. At this stage, \"Psittacosaurs\" would switch to a bipedal stance. These findings further reveal that the ancestor of \"Psittacosaurus\" was likely quadrupedal and eventually gained the ability to become bipedal as it evolved, with the young retaining the quadrupedal gait of the ancestor in question. These findings also lead to the hypothesis that many such dinosaur families may have evolved along this path at some point in their evolution.\n\nSeveral juvenile \"Psittacosaurus\" have been found. The smallest is a \"P. mongoliensis\" hatchling conserved in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), which is only 11 to 13 centimetres (4–5 inches) long, with a skull in length. Another hatchling skull at the AMNH is only long. Both specimens are from Mongolia. Juveniles discovered in the Yixian Formation are approximately the same age as the larger AMNH specimen.\n\nA histological examination of \"P. mongoliensis\" has determined the growth rate of these animals. The smallest specimens in the study were estimated at three years old and less than , while the largest were nine years old and weighed almost . This indicates relatively rapid growth compared to most reptiles and marsupial mammals, but slower than modern birds and placental mammals. An age determination study performed on the fossilized remains of \"P. mongoliensis\" by using growth ring counts suggest that the longevity of the basal ceratopsian was 10 to 11 years.\n\nThe find of a herd of six \"Psittacosaurus\" individuals killed and buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence of at least two age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.\n\nIn 2004, a specimen found in the Yixian Formation was claimed as evidence for parental care in dinosaurs. The specimen DNHM D2156 consists of 34 articulated juvenile \"Psittacosaurus\" skeletons, closely associated with the skull of an adult. The juveniles, all approximately the same age, are intertwined in a group underneath the adult, although all 34 skulls are positioned above the mass of bodies, as they would have been in life. This suggests that the animals were alive at the time of burial, which must have been extremely rapid, perhaps due to the collapse of a burrow. However, a 2013 paper pointed out that the adult specimen did not belong with the nest, its skull having no sedimentary connection to the main slab where the juveniles occurred, but had been glued onto it. This artificial association led to the inference that the skull belonged to an individual, possibly a \"mother\", that was providing parental care for the 34 juveniles—a claim that is unfounded. Furthermore, the adult was also shown to be six years old, whereas histological studies have shown \"P. mongoliensis\" was unable to breed until it reached ten years of age. It is also unlikely that a single female would have so many offspring at one time.\n\nA 2014 analysis of the same specimen supported the association and concluded that the proximity of the six-year-old specimen to the post-hatchlings may indicate post-hatchling cooperation, making the six-year-old specimen a possible caretaker.\n\nOut of the hundreds of known \"Psittacosaurus\" specimens, only one has been described to possess any sort of pathology. The specimen in question, consisting of a complete adult skeleton and tentatively assigned to \"P. mongoliensis\", was found in the lower beds of the Yixian Formation. There is no sign of a bone fracture, but very clear signs of an infection can be seen near the midpoint of the right fibula. The bone exhibits a large round pit, evidence of necrosis due to a lack of blood supply to the region. The pit is surrounded by a massive amount of swelling along the lower third of the bone. This large amount of bone deposited around the injury indicates that the animal survived for quite a while despite the injury and subsequent infection. As psittacosaurids were bipedal animals, a similar injury to a weight bearing bone in the leg would most likely have been fatal. Unlike the femur and tibia, the fibula is not a weight-bearing bone, so this animal would still have been able to walk to some extent. The source of the injury remains unknown.\n\nAnother fossil from the Yixian Formation provides direct evidence of \"Psittacosaurus\" as a prey animal. One skeleton of \"Repenomamus robustus\", a large triconodont mammal, is preserved with the remains of a juvenile \"Psittacosaurus\" in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first-known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile \"Psittacosaurus\" may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.\n\n\"Psittacosaurus\" is known from hundreds of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned to the type species, \"P. mongoliensis\". All \"Psittacosaurus\" fossils discovered so far have been found in Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly as far south as Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing \"Psittacosaurus\" fossils is from the late Barremian through Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101 mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of \"Psittacosaurus\", leading to the definition of this time period in the region as the \"Psittacosaurus\" biochron.\n\nThe earliest known species is \"P. lujiatunensis\", found in the lowest beds of the Yixian Formation. Over 200 specimens attributed to this genus have been recovered from these and other beds of the Yixian, the age of which is the subject of much debate. Although many early studies using radiometric dating put the Yixian in the Jurassic Period, tens of millions of years outside of the expected temporal range of \"Psittacosaurus\", most recent work dates it to the Early Cretaceous. Using argon–argon dating, a team of Chinese scientists dated the lowest beds in the formation to about 128 mya, and the highest to approximately 122 mya. A more recent Chinese study, using uranium–lead dating, suggests that the lower beds are younger, approximately 123.2 mya, while agreeing with an age of 122 mya for the upper beds.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1846 by Hector Henderson. The distillery did not fare well, and changed hands in 1854 when Norman Buchanan, owner of the Isle of Jura Distillery, took over. In 1863 the business was acquired by Bulloch Lade & Co, of Glasgow, traders in whisky stocks. \nAccording to the 1871 census, Duncan Johnston was the Distillery Manager at the time. Duncan was the nephew of John Johnston of Lagavulin and cousin to the Laphroaig Johnstons and so the family were involved with yet another distillery on the island.\nBy the 1880s over of whisky were produced there each year.\n\nIn 1920 Bulloch Lade went into voluntary liquidation, and a consortium of businessmen formed the Caol Ila Distillery Company Ltd. In 1927 the Distillers Company acquired a controlling interest in Caol Ila, and in 1930 Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd obtained ownership of all the shares. The distillery closed during World War II, from 1942 to 1945, because of wartime restrictions on the supply of barley to distillers. From then, production continued until 1972, when the entire structure of the distillery was demolished. A larger distillery was then built, designed by George Leslie Darge in the same architectural style as many of his others with his trademark glazed curtain walls to the still houses, and production resumed in 1974. The company eventually became part of Diageo.\n\nCaol Ila is one of the lighter Islay whiskies, pale in colour, with peaty, floral and peppery notes. In addition to being sold as a single malt, it is used heavily (around 95% of their production) in blends such as Johnnie Walker and Black Bottle. Since 1999, the distillery has also produced a non-peated \"highland spirit\".\n\nDifferent expressions of Caol Ila have generally rated highly at spirit ratings competitions. The 12-year, for example, received two double gold, three gold, and one silver medal from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2005 and 2010.

The 18- and 25-year expressions, though not as frequently rated by outside agencies, have also tended to score well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2274260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274260", "title": "Putting It Together", "text": "Putting It Together\n\nPutting it Together is a musical revue showcasing the songs of Stephen Sondheim. Drawing its title from a song in \"Sunday in the Park with George\", it was devised by Sondheim and Julia McKenzie. The revue has received several productions, beginning with its premiere in England in 1992, Broadway in 1999 and the West End in 2014.\n\nThe revue came about due to many requests for an update to \"Side by Side by Sondheim\" (1976). Having resisted a new show, he was finally convinced by producer Cameron Mackintosh, and Julia McKenzie was brought in to assist.\n\n\"Putting It Together\" was first performed on January 27, 1992 at the Old Fire Station Theatre in Oxford, England, where it ran for 24 performances. Directed by Julia McKenzie and produced by Cameron Mackintosh, the cast included Diana Rigg, Clive Carter, Claire Moore, Clarke Peters, and Kit Hesketh-Harvey.\n\nThe Manhattan Theatre Club production opened Off-Broadway on April 1, 1993 at New York City Center, where it ran for 59 performances and 37 previews.

Examples of this are \"Pachyrukhos\", a notoungulate that filled an ecological niche similar to those of rabbits and hares, and \"Homalodotherium\", which resembled chalicotheres. During the Pleistocene, \"Toxodon\" was the largest common notoungulate. Most of the group (\"Mixotoxodon\", \"Piauhytherium\" and \"Toxodon\" being exceptions) became extinct after the landbridge between North and South America formed and allowed North American ungulates to enter South America in the Great American Interchange, and then to out-compete the native fauna. \"Mixotoxodon\" was the only member of the group to be successful in invading Central America and southern North America, reaching as far north as Texas.\n\nThis order is united with other South American ungulates in the super-order Meridiungulata. The notoungulate and litoptern native ungulates of South America have been shown by studies of collagen and mitochondrial DNA sequences to be a sister group to the perissodactyls, making them true ungulates. The estimated divergence date is 66 million years ago. This conflicts with the results of some morphological analyses which favoured them as afrotherians. It is in line with some more recent morphological analyses which suggested they were basal euungulates. Panperissodactyla has been proposed as the name of an unranked clade to include perissodactyls and their extinct South American ungulate relatives.\n\nCifelli has argued that Notioprogonia is paraphyletic, as it would include the ancestors of the remaining suborders. Similarly, Cifelli indicated that Typotheria would be paraphyletic if it excluded Hegetotheria and he advocated inclusion of Archaeohyracidae and Hegetotheriidae in Typotheria.\n\nNotoungulata were for many years taken to include the order Arctostylopida, whose fossils are found mainly in China. Recent studies, however, have concluded that Arctostylopida are more properly classified as gliriforms, and that the notoungulates were therefore never found outside South and Central America.\n\nBased on an analysis of 133 morphological characters in 50 notoungulate genera, Billet in 2011 concluded that Homalodotheriidae, Leontiniidae, Toxodontidae, Interatheriidae, Mesotheriidae, and Hegetotheriidae are the only monophyletic families of notoungulates.\n\n\n\n"}

Edwards supported the slave trade, and was described by abolitionist William Wilberforce as a powerful opponent.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Bryan Edwards (died 1756) and his wife, Elizabeth Bayly, sister of Zachary Bayly, a slave-owner in Jamaica. After his father's death he was supported for a time by Nathaniel Bayly, another uncle, but they fell out.\nHis maintenance and education were then undertaken by Zachary Bayly. About 1759 Edwards joined his uncle Zachary Bayly in Jamaica, and Bayly engaged a private tutor to complete the boy's education.\n\nWhen Bayly died Edwards inherited his wealth, including six Jamaican plantations. In 1773 he also succeeded to the estate of another Jamaica resident named Hume.\n\nEdwards married Martha Phipps, daughter of Thomas Phipps of Brook House, Westbury and had one surviving son a daughter. He left the bulk of his estates to the son, Zacchary Hume Edwards, when he died in Southampton in 1800.\n\nEdwards became a leading member of the colonial assembly of Jamaica, but in a few years returned to England.\n\nIn 1782 Edwards tried and failed to secure a seat in parliament as member for Chichester. He was in Jamaica again from 1787 to 1792. He then settled in England as a West India merchant, making another failed attempt to enter Parliament in 1795, this time standing in Southampton.\n\nOn 28 May 1796, he became Member of Parliament for Grampound, a notoriously corrupt Cornish borough, along with Robert Sewell, another pro-slavery politician with interests in Jamaica. Edwards retained this seat until his death.\n\nIn 1784 Edwards wrote \"Thoughts on the late Proceedings of Government respecting the Trade of the West India Islands with the United States of America\", in which he attacked the restrictions placed by the government upon trade with the United States. In 1793 he published in two volumes the \"History, Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies\", and in 1797 published his \"Historical Survey of the French Colony in the Island of St Domingo\". The latter two titles were later republished, with some additional material, as the \"History of the British Colonies in the West Indies\", in three volumes. This has been translated into German and, in part, into French and Spanish. A fifth edition was issued in 1819.\n\nWhen Mungo Park returned in 1796 from his celebrated journey in Africa, Edwards drew up from Park's narrative an account of his travels. Edwards was secretary of the Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa, which published this piece in their \"Proceedings\". When Park wrote his own account of his journeys he availed himself of Edwards' assistance.\n\nEdwards also wrote poems and some other works relating to the history of the West Indies.\n\nEdwards was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1794.\n\n\n"}

At 13 he was awarded a sports scholarship to Ardingly College. He then moved to his home town club Brighton. He memorably scored a 120th-minute equaliser against Swindon Town in the 2004 Division Two Play Off Semi Final 2nd leg, to force a penalty shootout. Brighton won the shootout then faced Bristol City at the Millennium Stadium, who they beat to win promotion to the second tier. In the 2004–05 season he earned nationwide coverage on his significant performances that maintained Brighton's position in the Football League Championship.\n\nIn July 2005, he completed a move to Celtic for a reported £1.5 million. Virgo remained on the fringes until first-choice centre back Bobo Balde left for the African Cup Of Nations. He was given his second start of his Celtic career against Motherwell. He was awarded man of the match for his display by both broadcaster Setanta and the official Celtic website.\n\nOn 7 August 2006, he completed a season-long loan move to Coventry City, but on 31 August, Virgo was sent back to Celtic to continue his rehabilitation from a knee injury suffered whilst playing for Coventry. He scored once during his spell at Coventry; in a 2–1 loss to Leeds United.\n\nOn 17 August 2007, he moved to English Championship side Colchester United on a six-month loan deal. Having earned regular playing time at Colchester United, it was announced on 1 January 2008, that Virgo's loan spell at Colchester United was to be extended until the end of the season. However, the club was relegated and Virgo returned to Celtic. He scored once during his spell at Colchester; in a 3–2 loss to Burnley.\n\nOn 13 June 2008, it was announced that Virgo was free to leave Celtic, and seventeen days later, on 30 June 2008, Virgo re-joined Brighton on a free transfer. Virgo made a promising start to the 2008–9 season, netting three goals in his first two competitive appearances as well as making some eye-catching performances. After he left Celtic, he complained that he was not given enough opportunity (just 10 starts) and also that he was not treated properly especially after the death of his father and being attacked in a burglary just a few months later. Three years on, in an interview with vitalfootball.co.uk, Virgo complained that Manager Gordon Strachan lied to him after being persuaded to join Celtic and was dropped in favour of new Chinese player Du Wei after making his first appearance for Celtic. Those claims were denied by the club.\n\nVirgo was informed that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season and that he will be released by Brighton on 30 June 2010. On 3 July 2010, it was announced that Virgo was training with League One side Yeovil Town. He scored in a pre-season victory against Manchester United Reserves, before signing a one-year contract, five days later After making his debut against Leyton Orient on the opening game of the season, Virgo got his first league goal for his new club when he found the net in an away game at Bristol Rovers. He then found the net twice in a week as he first converted a penalty against Southampton, and then headed a winner at Walsall a few days later. Later in the season, Virgo then bagged two more goals against MK Dons several months later after his recent goal and another came against Bournemouth later towards the end of the season. After a promising season for Yeovil, he was offered a new contract, but decided to leave on a free transfer on 13 June 2011.\n\nShortly after his release from Yeovil, Virgo joined Paul Buckle's Bristol Rovers in League Two on a two-year contract. Ahead of the 2011–12 season, Virgo was appointed Vice-Captain of the club, under Matthew Gill. He made his debut live on Sky Sports against Wimbledon on the opening day of the season. He scored a penalty in the 85th minute to win Rovers the game 3–2. After making nine appearance in 2011–12 season, Virgo suffered a knee injury during training and had to undergo surgery. Following his recovery from injury, Virgo told BBC Radio Bristol that he was relieved to continue his football career after a career-threatening injury.\n\nIn 2012–13 season, Virgo played his first match in over six-months, in the opening game of the season, a 2–0 loss against Oxford United. Virgo was a regular in the first team, in the first six matches of the season, but by late October he soon suffered another knee injury. One month later it was announced he would be out for the remainder of the 2012/13 season. Though he had been told his time at Bristol Rovers was over, Virgo (along with Scott Bevan) remained at the club until they recovered from their injuries. In July 2013 it was announced that Virgo and Bevan had left the club, despite being offered the opportunity to finish their rehabilitation periods.\n\nFollowing this, Virgo trained with Crawley Town and made a substitute appearance in their pre-season friendly against Millwall.\n\nBorn and raised in Brighton in southern England, Virgo qualified to play for either England or Scotland. He was selected twice by Scotland at B international level.\n\nVirgo has worked for BT Sport as their main co-commentator to their National League coverage as well as their FA Cup and also coverage of European Football which covers French, German and Italian leagues. Adam has appeared on the Channel 5 Football Tonight show as a lead pundit. He has worked for Eurosport's coverage of Youth Tournaments and MLS football.

It is the story of a middle-aged schoolmaster (Bill Mor) with political ambitions who meets a young painter (Rain Carter), come to paint a former school headmaster's portrait.\n\nBill Mor is a middle-aged History and Latin teacher at a public school. He is married to Nan and has two children, Donald and Felicity. Mor has political ambitions to stand as a candidate for the Labour party, although his wife is firmly opposed to any such ambitions. At a friends' dinner, he makes the acquaintance of Rain Carter, a young artist who has arrived at the school to paint a portrait of Demoyte, the school's former headmaster. Mor shows Rain Carter around the town. They are spotted together by Mor's friend Tim Burke, who suspects Mor and Carter might be having an affair.\n\nOn one outing, Mor wants to show Miss Carter a small river outside the town. Miss Carter lets Mor, who doesn't have a license, drive her car through rough terrain, but the car gets stuck and damaged. Mor gets home late from this misadventure but chooses not to tell his wife about the incident. Nan and Felicity go away for a holiday in Dorset, and the love affair between Mor and Rain Carter develops during this time.\n\nNan comes home early from her holiday and surprises Mor kneeling in front of Rain with his head in her lap. In despair, Nan goes to Tim Burke. After a moment of mutual attraction between the two, Burke advises Nan to go back to her husband and not to ruin their relationship. However, Bill finds himself incapable of letting go of Rain. He is taken by her to an exhibition of her works in London and is deeply impressed with the pictures.\n\nMeanwhile, Mor's son Don climbs the school tower with a friend and is saved from a dangerous fall by his father, upon which Don is expelled from the school. He runs away from home and is missing for days. During his absence, there is a function at the school for the unveiling of the new portrait. Nan gives a public speech at this gathering, praising and encouraging her husband's political ambitions. Rain, who knew nothing of this side of Mor's life, decides to leave him in order not to be in the way of his ambitions and resolves to go back to France.\n\nThat night, she paints until the early hours of the morning, changing Demoyte's face in the portrait and, by daybreak, has left.

But a Mediterranean beach is not a place for playing on. It is dirty and very dry. The tides never wash the sand or make it firm. When I tried to make a sandcastle, the sand would just run away between my fingers. It was too dry to hold together. And even as I poured sea water over it, the sun would dry it up at once.\"\n\nWilliam Ingram adapted it as a television drama in 1963.\n"}
{"id": "2274332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274332", "title": "Eudimorphodon", "text": "Eudimorphodon\n\nEudimorphodon was a pterosaur that was discovered in 1973 by Mario Pandolfi in the town of Cene, Italy and described the same year by Rocco Zambelli. The nearly complete skeleton was retrieved from shale deposited during the Late Triassic (mid to late Norian stage), making \"Eudimorphodon\" one of the oldest pterosaurs known. It had a wingspan of about and at the end of its long bony tail may have been a diamond-shaped flap like in the later \"Rhamphorhynchus\". If so, the flap may have helped it steer while maneuvering in the air. \"Eudimorphodon\" is known from several skeletons, including juvenile specimens.\n\n\"Eudimorphodon\" was a small pterosaur, being in length, and weighing no more than . Its fourth finger had a very large size, and attached to the membrane making up the wing.\n\"Eudimorphodon\" showed a strong differentiation of the teeth, hence its name, which is derived from ancient Greek for \"true dimorphic tooth\". It also possessed a large number of these teeth, a total of 110 of them densely packed into a jaw only six centimeters long. The front of the jaw was filled with fangs, per side four in the upper jaw, two in the lower jaw, that rather abruptly gave way to a line of smaller multipointed teeth, 25 in the upper jaw, 26 in the lower jaw, most of which had five cusps\n\nThe morphology of the teeth are suggestive of a piscivorous diet, which has been confirmed by preserved stomach contents containing the remains of fish of the genus \"Parapholidophorus\". \"Eudimorphodon\" had slightly differing dentition with fewer teeth and may have had a more insectivorous diet. The top and bottom teeth of \"Eudimorphodon\" came into direct contact with each other when the jaws were closed, especially at the back of the jaw. This degree of \"dental occlusion\" is the strongest known among pterosaurs. The teeth were multi-cusped, and tooth wear shows that \"Eudimorphodon\" was able to crush or chew its food to some degree. Wear along the sides of these teeth suggests that \"Eudimorphodon\" also fed on hard-shelled invertebrates. The teeth distinguish \"Eudimorphodon\", because almost all other pterosaurs either had simple teeth, or lacked them altogether. Benson \"et al.\" (2012) noticed that the teeth would have been perfect for grabbing and crushing fish.\n\nDespite its great age, \"Eudimorphodon\" has few primitive characteristics making the taxon of little use in attempting to ascertain where pterosaurs fit in the reptile family tree. Basal traits though, are the retention of pterygoid teeth and the flexibility of the tail, which lacks the very long stiffening vertebral extensions other long-tailed pterosaurs possess. The paucity of early pterosaur remains has ensured that their evolutionary origin continues to be a mystery, with different experts suggesting affinities to dinosaurs, archosauriformes, or prolacertiformes.\n\nWithin the standard hypothesis that the Dinosauromorpha are the pterosaurs' close relatives within an overarching Ornithodira, \"Eudimorphodon\" is also unhelpful in establishing relationships within Pterosauria between early and later forms because then its multicusped teeth should be considered highly derived, compared to the simpler single-cusped teeth of Jurassic pterosaurs, and a strong indicator that \"Eudimorphodon\" is not closely related to the ancestor of later pterosaurs. Instead it is believed to be a member of a specialized off branch from the main \"line\" of pterosaur evolution, the Campylognathoididae. The following phylogenetic analysis follows the topology of Upchurch \"et al.\" (2015).\n\n\"Eudimorphodon\" currently includes one species, the type species \"Eudimorphodon ranzii\", which was first described by Zambelli in 1973. It is based on holotype MCSNB 2888. The specific name honours Professor Silvio Ranzi. A second species, \"Eudimorphodon rosenfeldi\", was named by Dalla Vecchia in 1995 for two specimens found in Italy. However, further study by Dalla Vecchia found that these actually represented a distinct genus, which he named \"Carniadactylus\" in 2009. A third species is \"Eudimorphodon cromptonellus\", described by Jenkins and colleagues in 2001. It is based on a juvenile specimen with a wingspan of just 24 centimeters, MGUH VP 3393, found in the early nineties in Jameson Land, Greenland. Its specific name honors Professor Alfred Walter Crompton; the name is a diminutive because the exemplar is so small. In 2015 it was named as a separate genus \"Arcticodactylus\" by Alexander Kellner. Specimen BSP 1994 I 51, in 2003 referred to a cf \"E. ranzii\", was in 2015 by Kellner made the genus \"Austriadraco\".\n\nIn 1986 fossil jaw fragments containing multicusped teeth were found in Dockum Group rocks in western Texas. One fragment, apparently from a lower jaw, contained two teeth, each with five cusps. Another fragment, from an upper jaw, also contained several multi-cusped teeth. These finds are very similar to \"Eudimorphodon\" and may be attributable to this genus, although without better fossil remains it is impossible to be sure.\n\nMany fossils have been found that once were referred to \"Eudimorphodon\", making \"Eudimorphodon\" represent one of the most abundant pterosaurs from Italy. Today, these have largely been made separate genera.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2274336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274336", "title": "Only Happy When It Rains", "text": "Only Happy When It Rains\n\n\"Only Happy When It Rains\" is an 1995 alternative rock song written and produced by alternative rock band Garbage for their self-titled debut studio album (1995). The song was recorded at the band's own recording studio, Smart Studios, in Madison, Wisconsin, and became known for its tongue-in-cheek lyrics parodying the typically angst-filled themes of mid-nineties alternative rock genre.\n\nReplacing \"Queer\" at the last-minute as the lead-in single for the debut album, \"Only Happy When It Rains\" was the band's breakthrough track in the United Kingdom, receiving positive reviews from the music press and strong support from BBC Radio One. In the United States, the single built upon the success of \"Queer\" at alternative radio and in early 1996 charted strongly on the Hot 100. The music video made MTV's next-big-thing Buzz Bin category, helping \"Only Happy When It Rains\" to cross over to Top 40 radio formats, and propelling the album \"Garbage\" from being a Heatseeker title into the top half of the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart. In Europe, where it was the fourth single from \"Garbage\", \"Only Happy\" followed the success of \"Stupid Girl\", by reaching the top ten European Alternative Rock airplay charts over the summer of 1996.\n\n\"Only Happy When It Rains\" has gone on to be an enduring work for the group. It has been covered by multiple artists, including metal legends Metallica, was featured as a playable track in the video game \"Guitar Hero 5\", and licensed to appear in episodes of nineties television shows such as \"\" and \"The X-Files\" and in 2019, featured on the soundtrack of the movie \"Captain Marvel\".\n\n\"Only Happy When It Rains\" was written and recorded between March 1994 and May 1995. It was written in sessions with band members Duke Erikson, Shirley Manson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig in Marker's basement recording studio, and recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. Bass on \"Only Happy When It Rains\" was played by Mike Kashou, and additional percussion by Pauli Ryan. In the latter stages of the album's recording, Garbage mixed \"Only Happy When It Rains\" twice before it was sent for mastering. At the last minute, Vig decided to make the guitar tracks louder; he later claimed the song still didn't sound the way he heard it in his head. The mix was noted for Manson's voice being at the same volume as the instruments; in mainstream pop, the lead vocal is usually louder than the instruments. The song is in the key of G# minor, the time signature of 4/4, and at a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Its chord progressions are G#m–F#–E–C#m–E–F# in the verses and C#-F#-A-B in the chorus.\n\nMarker explained the song's bleak lyrics as a mockery of the angsty \"wearing your heart on your sleeve thing\" prevalent in mid-1990s alternative rock songs, as well as a self-deprecating reference to Garbage's own dark lyrics. Manson explained that the song was \"a dig at ourselves because we like records that don't make us feel very happy, and at this so-called 'alternative' scene of 'we're so weird and more wonderful than everybody else'\". Vig added that \"'Only Happy When It Rains' was \"about what happened with grunge and the angst-filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene... With us there's self-deprecation, we have to poke fun at ourselves because we're so incredibly obsessive about the songs and the lyrics, which makes us filled with self-loathing, hurhur.\" Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song \"Happy When It Rains\" (1987) and Manson's own Scottish psyche. Lyrically, Manson described \"Only Happy When It Rains\" as \"about wanting love but knowing life will always get in the way... yet not being obliterated by that. It's a song for people that know what it is like to live on the dark side of life. It's about devotion but a different kind—a devotion to the truth and to freedom... and to hell with the consequences.\"\n\nWhen \"Only Happy When It Rains\" was remastered in 2007 for Garbage's greatest hits album \"Absolute Garbage\", it had to be reverse engineered from a damaged backup DAT as the analog masters for the debut album had been lost. This resulted in some discernible differences in the remaster. The original master tapes were found a few years later.\n\nIn 2015, an early demo mix of \"Only Happy When It Rains\" was included as a previously unreleased bonus track on \"Garbage (20th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition)\".\n\nUpon both the release of \"Garbage\" and of \"Only Happy When It Rains\" as a single, the song received a positive reception from music journalists. In his review of the single, Patrick Brennan of \"Hot Press\" declared \"Only Happy When It Rains\" his Single of the Fortnight, writing: \"It's hugely refreshing to come across a song which celebrates all those sad moments of loneliness that can be so life affirming\". \"Billboard\"s Larry Flick described the song as \"solid all the way through\", praising the overall production. A reviewer for \"Kerrang!\" wrote, \"A truly inspired single... Garbage combine a slightly sinister acidic approach with an infectious melodic atmosphere and an alternative punch. The result is awesome,\" and a reviewer for \"Music Week\" stated that \"Shirley Manson's vocals veer between fuzzy darkness, grinding catchy and crystal brilliance.\" Alastair Mabbot, writing for \"The List\", described the song as \"\"Spitting Image\"'s notion of alternative rock\".\n\nIn reviews for the debut album, Robert Yates of \"Q\" wrote that there was \"a nice self-deflating Morrissey touch to [the song]\", while Jackie Hinden of \"Hot Press\" felt that \"Only Happy When It Rains\" was \"like a Pretenders for the nineties\". Caroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" described the song as \"perversely pretty\", while Leo Finlay of \"Music Week\" compared the song to Mazzy Star, and that it \"employs the current hip status of country music to devastating effect\". \"Spin\"s Eric Weissard said the song was the only one he hated in Garbage's debut album, but reacted positively to the intro where \"backward guitars produce a chiming solo.\" At the end of 1995, \"Melody Maker\" rated \"Only Happy When It Rains\" the 49th best Song of the Year, writing up: \"In a year of sunny Britpop, reservoir supplies of ironic bubblegum pop-noir were dangerously low. This burst of mocking miserablism helped\". The track has been described as Garbage's signature song, and in 2000 was ranked as 69th in a list of 100 Greatest Pop Songs Of All Time jointly compiled by \"Rolling Stone\" and MTV.\n\nInitially, Mushroom Records had scheduled \"Queer\" to be the lead single for the UK release of the debut album \"Garbage\", matching the single release strategy internationally. At last minute, it was decided to release \"Only Happy When It Rains\" as a single ahead of the album, with \"Queer\" rescheduled to later in 1995. \"Only Happy When It Rains\" was quickly picked up by radio, and was C-listed by Radio One, and reached number 47 on the airplay chart. Mushroom issued the single on a limited-edition 7\" vinyl, CD and cassette on September 18, 1995. All formats were backed with two new tracks recorded specifically for the single: \"Girl Don't Come\" and \"Sleep\". After its first week on-sale, \"Only Happy When It Rains\" debuted and peaked on the UK Singles Chart at #29. At the end of the month, Garbage made their debut live appearance to perform the single on \"Top of the Pops\", providing momentum for the album \"Garbage\" to debut on the UK Albums Chart at #12.\n\nIn United States, after multiple stations began playlisting \"Only Happy When It Rains\" from mid-December 1995, Almo Sounds officially serviced the track to alternative radio at the start of January 1996. By the end of its first week, \"Only Happy\" had been added by thirty-five stations, in addition to the nine who jumped the release date. The track gained another eighteen stations the following week, and increased its playcount by almost 500 plays and a week later debuted on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. On February 20, Almo Sounds issued a commercial single for \"Only Happy\" in two formats, CD maxi and cassette single, backed with \"Girl Don't Come\" and \"Sleep\" as b-sides. On March 26, Almo serviced a new single remix of \"Only Happy When It Rains\" (which muted the synths) to Top 40 radio. Thirteen stations initially playlisted the single remix, rising to fifty by the end of the following month. Almo's marketing partner, Geffen, was at this point committed to working \"Only Happy When It Rains\" up to be a sizable hit. Garbage made their US TV debut performing \"Only Happy When It Rains\" on \"Saturday Night Special\" on April 27 as the song peaked at #54 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. In mid-May, \"Only Happy When It Rains\" peaked at #16 on the alternative charts and at #55 on the Hot 100, eventually spending twenty weeks on the chart. Garbage rounded out the promotional work for the track by performing \"Only Happy When It Rains\" at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards on June 8.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, Garbage's Australasian record label, White, released \"Only Happy When It Rains\" on May 27, 1996 as the follow-up to \"Stupid Girl\". The single was issued on CD single and cassette, backed with \"Driving Lesson\" and a house remix of album track \"Dog New Tricks\", both of which had been recorded by the band earlier in the year. On June 16, 1996, \"Only Happy When It Rains\" debuted on the ARIA singles chart and spent nine weeks in the top 100, peaking at n#80. A month later, the song debuted at #42 on the New Zealand singles chart, peaking the following week at 38th.\n\nAcross Europe, Mushroom Records international distributor BMG released \"Only Happy When It Rains\" in two formats, a two-track card sleeve CD single with \"Dog New Tricks\", or a four-track maxi single with \"Dog New Tricks\", a remix of \"Stupid Girl\" by Red Snapper and a remix of \"Queer\" by Danny Saber. Following the band's performance at the Lowlands Festival, the single was a success in the Netherlands, peaking at #34 on the Dutch Top 40 and #36 on the Single Top 100. \"Only Happy When It Rains\" began to be playlisted by a number of radio stations across the continent, eventually reaching #8 on the European alternatvie rock chart by September 1996.\n\nIn 1999, B-side \"Girl Don't Come\" was used in the PlayStation game F1 Racing Championship.\n\nThe promotional video for \"Only Happy When It Rains\" was filmed in mid-January 1996 in Los Angeles by director Samuel Bayer, simultaneously with the video for single \"Stupid Girl\". As Almo Sounds thought \"Only Happy When It Rains\" would be more successful, the video was given a higher budget than the video for \"Stupid Girl\". The music video debuted in the United States on February 12, 1996, where it was playlisted immediately by MTV as a \"Buzz clip\", which would guarantee heavy rotation on their network.\n\nThe video begins a short prologue sequence with several children dressed in animal costumes playing in an overcast field, before cutting to Garbage upon the commencement of the song. Garbage are located in a litter-strewn warehouse, where the male members of the band destroy vinyl records, videotape and musical instruments as Manson performs to the camera. Some sequences feature Manson performing the song while on her own in dilapidated toilet stalls. The video ends with inter-cut footage of Manson joining the children on the field.\n\nThe \"Only Happy When It Rains\" video was first commercially released – along with out-take footage shot while filming – on VHS and Video-CD on 1996's \"Garbage Video\". A remastered version of the video was later included on Garbage's 2007 greatest hits DVD \"Absolute Garbage\" and made available as a digital download via online music services the same year. The \"Only Happy When It Rains\" video was uploaded to VEVO in 2013.\n\nAs one of Garbage's signature songs, \"Only Happy When It Rains\" has been covered by a number of artists over the years. In 2000, comedic musician Richard Cheese performed a lounge arrangement of the song on his album \"Lounge Against the Machine\". Actress Katerina Graham recorded a pop rock cover for use in \"The Vampire Diaries\" second season episode \"The Sacrifice\". In 2006, The Pretenders played the song with Shirley Manson at VH1 Decades Rock Live!. In 2007, Metallica covered the song during an acoustic performance at Neil Young's Bridge School Benefit show. In 2010, The I.M.F.s (Bernard Fowler, Stevie Salas, T. M. Stevens and Dave Abruzzese) played a funk/soul version of the song at Rockpalast. In 2017, New Years Day and Lzzy Hale from Halestorm covered the song at Alternative Press Music Awards. New Years Day would later include a studio version of the cover featuring Hale on their 2018 EP \"Diary of a Creep\".\n\nIn 2009, \"Only Happy When It Rains\" was featured as a playable song in the videogame \"Guitar Hero 5\". By playing the song in \"Career Mode\", a virtual avatar of Shirley Manson could be unlocked for use elsewhere within the game.\n\n\"Only Happy When It Rains\" appeared in the episode and in an 1999 episode of \"The X-Files\" entitled \"Terms of Endearment\". The song was going to appear in the 1997 movie \"Nightwatch\" (along with \"Supervixen\"), but they got replaced by different songs in the final cut. \"Only Happy When It Rains\" also appeared in the 2019 movie \"Captain Marvel\".\n\nContinuing their theme of collectible 7\" vinyl releases, which had seen \"Vow\" packaged in an aluminium sleeve and \"Subhuman\" in black rubber, Mushroom packaged the 7\" format for \"Only Happy When It Rains\" in a \"Prismaboard\" (rain-effect) die-cut card sleeve, with a hologram logo sticker on the inner jacket. The b-side of the vinyl was pressed with a double-groove, so that either \"Girl Don't Come\" or \"Sleep\" played depending on where the stylus landed; the songs were shorter on the vinyl than they were on the CD or cassette formats to accommodate both on one side of the disc. This pressing was limited to 5,000 copies. The original design for the vinyl was for the sleeve to be made from wood, or corrugated cardboard, with wing-nuts in each corner like a flower-press. The nuts would have to have been unscrewed to find the vinyl disc inside - between ten layers of different types of cardboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nGarbage\n\nAdditional musicians\nProduction\n\n"}

{"id": "2274342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274342", "title": "Eivind Berggrav", "text": "Eivind Berggrav\n\nEivind Josef Berggrav (25 October 1884 – January 14, 1959) was a Norwegian Lutheran bishop. As Primate of the Church of Norway (Norwegian:\"Preses i Bispemøtet i Den norske kirke\"), Berggrav became known for his unyielding resistance against the Nazi occupation of Norway during World War II.\nBerggrav also became an important figure in 20th-century ecumenical movement and served as president of the United Bible Societies.\n\nBerggrav was born Eivind Jensen in Stavanger and raised in Asak in Østfold. His father, Otto Jensen (like his father before him) was an educator and parish priest, who when Eivind was 22 became for a short time Norway's National Minister of Education and Church Affairs in a coalition government before returning to his Skjeberg parish. Rev. Jensen later became dean in the Diocese of Kristiania, and, in the year before his death, bishop of the Diocese of Hamar. His wife, and Eivind's mother, was Marena Christine Pedersen (1846–1924).. His sister's daughter was Kari Berggrav, the pioneer press photographer\n\nEivind studied theology in Oslo at what was then the University of Kristiania beginning in 1903, and continued family tradition by becoming a priest in the Church of Norway. He changed his surname to that of his paternal grandmother's family: to Jensen Berggrav in 1907 and a decade later to simply Berggrav.\n\nUpon graduating from the university in 1908, Jensen Berggrav taught school for a decade (at the Eidsvoll folkehøgskole, Holmestrand offentlige lærerskole and Akershus fylkesskole). He also started writing for the journal, \"Kirke i Kultur\", which Berggrav continued to do intermittently for decades, until his death. During World War I Berggrav filed some stories as a war correspondent for the \"Morgenbladet,\" Norway's largest newspaper. Berggrav also became involved with the \"Østlandsk reisning\" political party and the \"Østlandsk ungdomsfylking\" youth movement with Alf Frydenberg. Both social movements sought to incorporate the language spoken in eastern Norway into the national written language. (See Norwegian language conflict).\n\nBerggrav eventually was called as a parish priest in Hurdal, and he continued to study for his doctorate in theology at the University. In the three years after he received it in 1924, Rev. Berggrav also served as chaplain of Botsfengselet national prison in Oslo. In 1928 Berggrav was selected as bishop for the Diocese of Hålogaland based at Tromsø. He dedicated a number of new chapels as he served the largely rural diocese until 1937. In that year, although younger than many other candidates, Berggrav was selected bishop for the Diocese of Oslo, which although the first among equals, remains the highest position in Norway's national church. The funeral of Queen Maud the following year first brought Berggrav international attention. Except technically during his house arrest during 1942-1945 as discussed below, Berggrav continued to lead the Norwegian faithful until 1951.\nBerggrav achieved international renown for leading the Church of Norway's resistance to the Nazi occupation of Norway during World War II, even though he was under isolated house arrest during most of the war.\n\nIn the years immediately before the war, Bergrrav worked with then Crown Prince Olav and others to try to mediate between Germany and England. Shocked by the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, with its attempted capture of King Haakon VII, Berggrav initially appealed to Norwegian Christians to \"refrain from any interference\" and to refuse to \"mix themselves up in the war by sabotage or in any other way.\" After King Haakon was forced to leave for England after 62 days of fighting, with his king's approval, Berggrav became the leader of the Administrative Council which tried to govern his occupied homeland. However, it became increasingly clear that the occupying Nazi powers would not honor their promises to allow Norwegians freedom of religion nor preserve their structures of government. On September 25, the Nazis dissolved the Administrative Council, in favor of another established by Vidkun Quisling, a Norwegian priest's son who had a military career before becoming a Nazi sympathizer (and whom King Haakon refused to appoint as prime minister after the 1940 Nazi invasion).\n\nA month later Berggrav led his six fellow bishops of the Church of Norway, with ten leaders of other denominations, to form the Christian Council for Joint Deliberation. When the Nazis ordered the Church of Norway to alter its liturgical practices, Bishop Berggrav refused to comply. Matters grew even more serious in January 1942 when the Nazis wound down their occupation government and allowed Quisling (head of a party with only 1% popular support) to try again. On February 1, 1942, a group of Quisling sympathizers invaded Nidaros Cathedral and by the end of the day refused the Cathedral's Dean Kjellbu entry to conduct services. Thousands of Norwegians gathered outside to sing \"A mighty fortress is our God,\" and the following day all seven Norwegian bishops resigned. \n\nShortly after Easter, 1942, Berggrav was arrested, and Quisling tried to get him indicted, which provoked further public uproar. Along with four other members of the Christian Council, Berggrav was initially imprisoned in the Bredtvet concentration camp. Berggrav was saved from execution by Theodor Steltzer and Helmuth von Moltke, members of the Kreisau Circle and Schwarze Kapelle. Instead, the bishop was placed in solitary confinement at an isolated location in the forests north of Oslo, allowed to see no one but his guards. Almost all of the priests of the Church of Norway resigned in protest against the Nazi tyranny, as did teachers a few months later when faced with Quisling's proposal to force Norwegian children to join an organization modeled on the Hitler Youth. Since all the clergy of the Church of Norway were also civil servants at the time, this shunning of the orders of the Quisling regime sent a powerful message to Norwegians that tyrants would not be obeyed - no matter what the price.\n\nWith his guards' implicit cooperation, Berggrav often secretly left his hut in Asker to meet with the Norwegian underground. Because his face was well known, the bishop often wore disguises, such as a policeman's uniform or thick glasses and a fake mustache. In its Christmas 1944 edition, \"TIME magazine\" put Berggrav on its cover; he thus became one of the relatively few protestant religious figures to have received this honor.\n\nBerggrav wrote many books, all in the Norwegian language, but some translated into English: \"The Norwegian Church in Its International Setting\", \"Man and State\", and \"With God in the Darkness, and Other Papers Illustrating the Norwegian Church Conflict\". Berggrav founded an association focused on Norway's local history, Romerike Historielag, in 1920, and continued to contribute pieces long after he relinquished the helm upon becoming bishop. Berggrav also led the Norwegian Bible Society (\"Det Norske Bibelselskap\") from 1938 to 1955, even after his retirement as Norway's primate.\n\nBerggrav married Kathrine Seip (1883–1949), the daughter of pastor Jens Laurits Arup Seip (1852–1913). They remained married until her death in 1949. Their son Dag Berggrav became an important civil servant and sports administrator. Berggrav died in Oslo and was buried in Vår Frelsers Gravlund with a simple slab gravemarker.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It had a wingspan of 0.9 m (3 ft).\n\nThe first known \"Scaphognathus\" specimen was described in 1831 by August Goldfuss who mistook the tailless specimen for a new \"Pterodactylus\" species: \"P. crassirostris\". The specific name means \"fat snout\" in Latin. This specimen was an incomplete adult with a 0.9 m (3 ft) wingspan recovered from the Solnhofen strata near Eichstätt. In 1858 Johann Wagner referred the species to \"Rhamphorhynchus\". After recognising the fundamentally different snout shape, Wagner, after previous failed attempts by Leopold Fitzinger and Christoph Gottfried Andreas Giebel, who used preoccupied names, in 1861 named a distinct genus: \"Scaphognathus\", derived from Greek \"skaphe\", \"boat\" or \"tub\", and \"gnathos\", \"jaw\", in reference to the blunt shape of the lower jaws.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the \"rhamphorhynchoid\" nature of \"S. crassirostris\" was recognized after the discovery of the second specimen in Mühlheim, whose long tail was preserved. The second \"Scaphognathus\" specimen was more complete than its predecessor, but only half the size (twenty inch wingspan) and with partially ossified bones. These characters indicate that the second specimen was a juvenile.\n\nThe \"Scaphognathus\" is known from three specimens, all of which originated in the Kimmeridgian-age Solnhofen Limestone. Physically it was very similar to \"Rhamphorhynchus\", albeit with notable cranial differences.\n\nFor one, \"Scaphognathus\" had a proportionately shorter skull (4.5 in) with a blunter tip and a larger antorbital fenestra. Its teeth oriented vertically rather than horizontally. The traditional count of them held that eighteen teeth were in the upper jaws and ten in the lower. S. Christopher Bennett, studying a new third specimen, SMNS 59395, in 2004 determined there were only sixteen teeth in the upper jaws, the higher previous number having been caused by incorrectly adding replacement teeth.\n\nComparisons between the scleral rings of \"Scaphognathus\" and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been diurnal. This may also indicate niche partitioning with contemporary pterosaurs inferred to be nocturnal, such as \"Ctenochasma\" and \"Rhamphorhynchus\".\n\nThe \"cladogram\" (family tree) of rhamphorhynchids below is the result of a large phylogenetic analysis published by Andres & Myers in 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

Novak was co-host of a weekly cable television show, \"American Political Zone,\" and of a nationally syndicated radio show, \"Vernuccio-Novak Report.\"\n\nIn April 2018, Dan Postemski, an Iraq War veteran and chairman of the Hampton Republican Town Committee, announced his plans to challenge Courtney in the 2018 election. Postemski said that he wanted \"to bring common sense to budgeting\" and that he was \"a strong supporter of the 2nd amendment\" and would \"fight to the death to save it.\" In a reference to Courtney's participation in a gun-control sit-in, Postemski said, \"Joe Courtney has literally sat down on the job, right on the floor of the House. That’s not how a leader makes change.\"\n\nIn March 2015, after receiving two phone calls at home from scammers impersonating IRS agents demanding payment of owed taxes, Courtney warned his constituents to be wary of such scams.\n\nA golf game Courtney played with President Obama was highlighted on \"NPR\" in June 2015.\n\nIn response to purported Republican hostility toward Muslims, Democratic National Committee Vice Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) urged Democratic members of Congress to invite Muslims as their guests to President Obama's State of the Union address in January 2016. Accordingly, Courtney invited Dr. Mohammed Qureshi, president of the Baitul Aman Mosque, an Ahmadiyya house of worship in Connecticut. The invitation garnered considerable media attention.\n\nIn a statement responding to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Courtney called it \"one gigantic gift for corporations and the wealthiest Americans in exchange for next to nothing for average middle-class and working families.\"\n\nAlong with other members of Congress who demanded that the House pass stricter gun-control legislation, Courtney took part in a sit-in on the House floor on June 22, 2016.\n\nIn 2010, Courtney was the leading voice in the House against the so-called \"Cadillac tax\" on high-dollar health plans, part of the funding proposed for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn March 2008, Courtney described the U.S. policy in Iraq as \"two-headed.\" While the Bush Administration asked troops \"to serve and sacrifice on behalf of Iraq's fledgling government,\" Iraqi leaders are friendly with Iran. \"The White House,\" he wrote, \"needs to work with Congress to construct a reasonable long term security agreement with Iraq that address Iraq's relations with Iran.\"\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Courtney issued a statement in support of President Obama's Iran deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. \"I believe that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best option for our nation and the international community to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapons capability,\" he wrote.\n\nWhen President Trump decided to withhold certification of the Iran nuclear agreement, Courtney issued a statement in which he claimed that Trump's move \"directly contradicts the opinion of our nation's highest military leadership\" and \"puts us at odds with our closest allies such as the U.K., France and Germany, and undermines our country's ability to credibly execute a multilateral diplomatic resolution of the crisis in the Korean peninsula.\"\n\nCourtney is known for his success at delivering funding for his district's submarine bases, and has acquired the nickname \"Two-Sub Joe\" for having made possible the construction of two new submarines. In 2016, the \"Hartford Courant\" endorsed him primarily because he had \"brought home defense jobs.\"\n\nIn March 2017, Courtney protested President Trump's revised executive order temporarily restricting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. He maintained that America's \"moderate allies from Muslim-majority nations\" had \"repeatedly warned President Trump that these rash orders damage our standing to lead the anti-ISIS collation\" and that the executive order would result in a \"backlash...overseas.\" Courtney added that the U.S. is \"a nation of opportunity and a nation of immigrants, and this blanket ban on entry from six nations could mean that best and the brightest from those countries, and other Muslim-majority countries will no longer view the United States as an option for making a better life. This ban is not only a prize propaganda tool for terrorists who want to hurt us, it hurts American prestige abroad, and harms American businesses, schools, and institutions that rely on the hard work of immigrants from around the world, including these six countries.\"\n\n\nPrior to the 112th Congress, Courtney served on the Committee on Education and Labor with membership on the Subcommittee on Higher Education, Lifelong Learning, and Competitiveness and Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\nCourtney has branded himself as bipartisan and has blamed various government crises on failure to \"support a real compromise.\" He said in 2012 that though recent budget cuts to education were a \"little heavy\" and the Budget Control Act \"ham handed,\" he voted for them out of a spirit of compromise. \"It took guys like me to cross the aisle and make sure we didn't fall off the tracks there as a country,\" Courtney said.\n\nIn a March 30, 2017, column, David Collins of \"The Day\" complained that in the era of Trump, Courtney's \"calm diligence, his even-mannered consideration of the issues, his bent toward bipartisanship, which have been the hallmark of his successful terms in Washington,\" now seemed \"a bit shy of the task at hand.\" While callers to a recent town hall meeting \"laid out their many anxieties in the time of Trump, from fears about Medicaid to climate change and flood risks, Courtney responded with soothing retorts\" and with \"talk of bipartisanship and accommodation.\" Collins complained they would prefer to \"hear a loud voice from the new party of no.\"\n\nCourtney was criticized in August 2009 for holding a teleconference with voters about health care instead of an in-person town hall. Richard Hanley, graduate journalism director at Quinnipiac University complained that part of Courtney's job \"is to wade into the muck of the process as it is, not as we would like it to be.\"\n\nAfter seeing Steven Spielberg's film \"Lincoln\" in February 2013, Courtney wrote a letter to the director pointing out that although the film showed Connecticut House members voting against the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, in fact the state's entire congressional delegation had supported the amendment. He asked Spielberg for some kind of acknowledgment of the error, perhaps on the DVD. \"It's important that people be aware who saw this movie that we were a state that lost soldiers, were staunch supporters of Lincoln in both elections and, in the case of the Democrat from New Haven, actually voted against his party in support of the amendment,\" said Courtney, who made his letter public. \"The state's good name, I personally feel, was tarnished a bit.\" His criticism, in the words of the \"Washington Post\", \"played well back home in Connecticut,\" where it occasioned \"a number of grateful newspaper editorials,\" but \"set off alarms in showbiz circles: Ballots had just gone out to Oscar voters. Was the congressman trying to influence the Academy Awards in favor of another contender?\" \"The Post\" noted that \"Courtney had a debt to Ben Affleck,\" who had campaigned for him and whose film Argo was up against Lincoln for Best Picture.\n\nCourtney lives with his wife, a nurse practitioner, and two children in Vernon, a suburb of Hartford.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Beasley Broadcast Group and broadcasts an adult hits format. Studios are located in Bala Cynwyd and the broadcast tower used by the station is located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia at ().\n\nThe station plays a mix of 1970s, 1980s and 1990s hits, with some current hot adult contemporary singles. Named after Benjamin Franklin, the station pioneered a \"Playing Anything We Feel Like\" radio format, a formula that originated in Canada as Jack FM. Unlike many Adult Hits stations, WBEN-FM uses DJs. The voice of actor l John O'Hurley was used for station imaging voiceovers, now they use Howard Cogan the former voice of JACK FM.\n\nThe station was founded as WFLN by civic leaders as a \"fine arts\" station, and first went on the air in March 1949 with a classical music format. WFLN added the -FM suffix in 1956 when an AM simulcast of the station launched on 900 kHz. The station was sold in 1988 to Marlin Broadcasting, which added more news, sports and traffic reports. From 1995 to 1997, WFLN was bought and sold five more times. With each purchase, budget cutbacks were instituted and, while maintaining the Classical format, the station adopted a more commercial sound with shorter familiar selections dominating the playlist in most dayparts.\n\nFinally, on September 5, 1997, at 6 p.m., Tom Milewski, the chief operating officer for Greater Media, which had recently acquired the station, announced that the station was ending its Classical programming. WFLN's classical recordings were donated to WRTI (Temple University's non-commercial radio station) and Greater Media provided financial support to Temple as formerly all-Jazz WRTI adopted the WFLN Classical format during the day along with three of the WFLN program hosts. WRTI continued to program its Jazz format at night. Greater Media stated at the time that classical music would be best preserved as a non-commercial format; Greater Media's support of WRTI also served to deflect criticism that the company was taking away Philadelphia's only Classical radio station.\n\nAfter the Classical format ended, 95.7 then became WXXM, \"Max 95.7\", adopting a Modern AC format similar to, but slightly softer than alternative rock station Y100. The first song played in the new format was Sheryl Crow's \"A Change Would Do You Good.\" The station reported to radio trade publications as a hot adult contemporary station. WXXM was jockless for the first 6 months as \"Max\", and the ratings plummeted compared to the final survey under the Classical format. Although WXXM added well-known Philadelphia jock Paul Barsky to mornings in February 1999, which resulted in some ratings improvement, it wasn't enough to warrant keeping the format.\n\nAt Noon on May 13, 1999, in the middle of Sarah McLachlan's \"Building a Mystery\", the station switched format to rhythmic oldies, playing a blend of urban oldies from the '60s to the '80s, disco, classic dance tunes, and some '70s pop hits, branded as \"Jammin' Gold\". The first song under the new format was \"Back Stabbers\" by The O'Jays. On August 30, the station changed call signs to WEJM. Given Philadelphia's history with the R&B genre, as well as having the demographics needed to support the format, \"Jammin' Gold\" was initially well received in the market. However, by 2001, the station's ratings began to slip.\n\nOn June 15, 2001, WEJM became \"Mix 95.7\", another incarnation of Hot AC. On July 17, WEJM changed call signs to WMWX. The station initially leaned toward Modern AC, before moving to a more traditional Hot AC approach. The station continued to be plagued by mediocre ratings.\n\nMeanwhile, Infinity/CBS Radio was in the process of switching some of its FM stations to adult hits, a broad-based adult rock and pop format branded as \"Jack FM\" with its most-notable slogan \"We play what we want!!\" Jack stations typically had playlists that could encompass up to two thousand songs. Stations that adopted the format were mostly under-performers in their previous formats, but a few, such as New York's WCBS-FM, were decently-rated heritage oldies stations.\n\nWith rumors circulating that there were plans to switch oldies WOGL to \"Jack,\" on March 21, 2005, at 5 p.m., after playing \"Better Man\" by Pearl Jam, the station rebranded as \"95.7 Ben FM\". The first song on \"Ben\" was \"Philadelphia Freedom\" by Elton John. The call sign was changed to WBEN-FM on May 9, 2005. The \"Ben\" format is similar to the \"Jack FM\" stations in terms of playlist size and the character of the songs played (format and decade of original release), with the slogan \"playing anything we feel like.\" WBEN-FM has tweaked its format in recent years to add more classic alternative tracks from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.\n\nOn July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WBEN-FM) for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, and the sale closed on November 1.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, for one week, Ben FM rebranded as \"95.7 Bryce FM\" to celebrate the signing of Bryce Harper to the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nOn April 1, 2019, the station switched to television music as part of an April Fools joke.\n\nIn 2006, WBEN added an HD2 subchannel to carry a commercial-free hybrid Rhythmic AC/Classic Dance format under the name \"Club Ben.\" The format consists of a mix of ‘70s funk and R&B, and ’80s and ‘90s pop/dance music. This format is similar to the former \"Jammin' Gold\" format, as well as the Rhythmic AC format formerly aired on WISX.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2274399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274399", "title": "Pterodaustro", "text": "Pterodaustro\n\nPterodaustro is a genus of Cretaceous pterodactyloid pterosaur from South America, which lived 105 million years ago.\n\nThe first fossils, among them the holotype PLV 2571, a thigh bone, were in the late sixties discovered by Bonaparte in the Lagarcito Formation, situated in the San Luis Province of Argentina, and dating from the Albian. The genus has later also been found in Chile in the Santa Ana Formation. At the Argentine site, the just large \"Loma del \"Pterodaustro\"\", since then during several expeditions over 750 \"Pterodaustro\" specimens have been collected, 288 of them having been catalogued until 2008. This makes the species one of the best known pterosaurs, with examples from all growth stages, from egg to adult.\n\nThe genus was named in 1969 by José Bonaparte as an as yet undescribed \"nomen nudum\". The first description followed in 1970, making the name valid, the type species being \"Pterodaustro guiñazui\". The genus name is derived from Greek \"pteron\", \"wing\" and Latin \"auster\", \"south (wind)\". The elements are combined as a condensed \"pteron de austro\", \"wing from the south\". The specific name honours paleontologist Román Guiñazú. It was emended in 1978 by Peter Wellnhofer into \"guinazui\", because diacritical signs such as the tilde are not allowed in species names.\n\n\"Pterodaustro\" has a very elongated skull, up to 29 centimetres long. The portion in front of the eye sockets comprises 85% of skull length. The long snout and lower jaws curve strongly upwards; the tangent at the point of the snout is perpendicular to that of the jaw joint. \"Pterodaustro\" has about a thousand bristle-like modified teeth in its lower jaws that might have been used to strain crustaceans, plankton, algae, and other small creatures from the water. These teeth stand for the most part not in separate alveoli but in two long grooves parallel to the edges of the jaw. They have a length of three centimetres and are oval in cross-section, with a width of just 0.2–0.3 millimetres. At first it was suspected these structures were not true teeth at all, but later research established they were built like normal teeth, including enamel, dentine and a pulp. Despite being made of very hard material, they might still have been flexible to some extent due to their extreme length-width ratio, a bend of up to 45° being possible. The upper jaws also carried teeth, but these were very small with a flat conical base and a spatula-formed crown. These teeth also do not have separate tooth sockets but were apparently held by ligaments in a special tooth pad, that was also covered with small ossicles, or bone plates.\n\nThe back of the skull was also rather elongated and in a low position; there are some indications for a low parietal crest.\n\n\"Pterodaustro\" had an adult wingspan of approximately . Its hindlimbs are rather robust and its feet large. Its tail is uniquely elongated for a pterodactyloid, containing 22 caudal vertebrae, whereas other members of this group have at most sixteen.\n\n\"Pterodaustro\" probably strained food with its tooth comb, a method called \"filter feeding\", also practised by modern flamingos. Once it caught its food, \"Pterodaustro\" probably mashed it with the small, globular teeth present in its upper jaw. Like other ctenochasmatoids, \"Pterodaustro\" has a long torso and proportionally massive and splayed hindfeet, adaptations for swimming.\nRobert Bakker suggested that, like flamingos, this pterosaur's diet may have resulted in a pink hue.\n\nAt least two specimens of \"Pterodaustro\" have been found, MIC V263 and MIC V243, with gizzard stones in the stomach cavity, the first ever reported for any pterosaur. These clusters of small stones with angled edges support the idea that \"Pterodaustro\" ate mainly small, hard-shelled aquatic crustaceans using filter-feeding. Such invertebrates are abundant in the sediment of the fossil site.\n\nA study of the growth stages of \"Pterodaustro\" concluded that juveniles grew relatively fast in their first two years, attaining about half of the adult size. Then they reached sexual maturity, growing at a slower rate for four to five years until there was a determinate growth stop.\n\nIn 2004 a \"Pterodaustro\" embryo in an egg was reported, specimen MHIN-UNSL-GEO-V246. The egg was elongated, six centimetres long and 22 millimetres across and its mainly flexible shell was covered with a thin layer, 0.3 mm thick, of calcite. Three-dimensionally preserved eggs were reported in 2014.\n\nComparisons between the scleral rings of \"Pterodaustro\" and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been nocturnal and similar in activity patterns to modern anseriform birds that feed at night.\n\nBecause of its long torso and neck and comparatively short legs, \"Pterodaustro\" was unique among pterosaurs in having difficulties to launch. Even with the pterosaurian quadrupedal launching mechanism, it would have required frantic and fairly-low angled take-offs possible only in open areas, much like modern geese and swans.\n\nBonaparte in 1970 assigned \"Pterodaustro\" to the Pterodactylidae; in 1971 to a Pterodaustriidae. However, from 1996 cladistic studies by Alexander Kellner and David Unwin have shown a position in the Ctenochasmatidae, together with other filter feeders.\n\nThe genus \"Puntanipterus\" might be a subjective junior synonym of \"Pterodaustro\".\nCladogram following Andres, Clark & Xu, 2014.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2274409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274409", "title": "Toxodonta", "text": "Toxodonta\n\nToxodonta or Toxodontia is a suborder of the meridiungulate order Notoungulata. Most of the members of the five included families, including the largest notoungulates, share several dental, auditory and tarsal specializations. The group is named after \"Toxodon\", the first example of the group to be discovered by science.\n\nIsotemnidae, the oldest and most primitive family of toxodonts, were generally large animals with larger canines than other early notoungulates. The family is probably paraphyletic or polyphyletic since only primitive dental features unite the 12 included genera, such as a complete dentition with unreduced canines and no diastemata in the earliest genera. Likewise, they are only weakly linked to other toxodonts by a few dental features, and their primitive cheek tooth pattern can be basal to all notoungulates except notioprogonians. The oldest of the 12 genera in this family is \"Isotemnus\" known from the Riochican-Casamayoran, but other genera are known from the Casamayoran, including \"Thomashuxleya\", \"Pleurostylodon\", and \"Pampatemnus\". Of these, the sheep-sized \"Thomashuxleya\" is the best known; its skeleton shows that it was relatively robust, had limbs with reduced distal elongation, and five-hoofed feet with a large central digit.\n\nNotohippidae was also present during the Casamayoran but tend to have more hypsodont cheek teeth than isotemnids. \"Pampahippus\", one of the earliest genera in this family was, nevertheless, low-crowned with densely packed cheek teeth. Its primitiveness is suggested by the retained paraconids on the lower molars. \"Eomorphippus\", a Mustersan notohippid, was moderately hypsodont, Deseadan genera such as \"Thynchippus\" and \"Eurygenium\" were very high-crowned, and Santacrucian genera had acquired cementum on the crowns similar to equids.\n\nThe last surviving notohippid was \"Colpodon\" from the late Oligocene, which was medium-sized but heavily built.\nThe last toxodont family from the early Tertiary are the Leontiniidae. They share several derived tarsal and auditory features with the notohippids and are, together with the Deseadan Toxodontidae, nested within the paraphyletic Notohippidae. Leontiniids are known from the Deseadan or later, but the oldest and most primitive leontiniid, the Mustersan \"Martinmiguela\", retained a primitive brachydont dentition without diastemata except around the very small canines. \"Scarrittia\", the best-known leontiniid, had mesaxonic (enlarged central digit) feet with reduced lateral digits.\n\nToxodontids first appeared during the Oligocene in the form of \"Proadinotherium\". Another well-known toxodontid is \"Nesodon\", a medium-sized Miocene toxodontid descended from \"Proadinotherium\" which had converted its second upper incisors into tusks. \"Toxodon\" itself evolved during the Pliocene alongside the related \"Trigodon\", an equally large mammal which possessed a horn projecting from its forehead, in the same way as a modern rhinoceros. \"Toxodon\" was a huge herbivore (about the size of a modern black rhinoceros) with four toes on each foot.\n\n"}

The specific name honours German paleontologist Peter Wellnhofer. Two larger species, originally named \"Tapejara imperator\" and \"Tapejara navigans\", were later classified in the genus \"Tapejara\". However, several studies have shown that \"T. imperator\" and \"T. navigans\" are significantly different from \"T. wellnhoferi\" and therefore were reclassified into new genera. The species \"T. imperator\" was given its own genus, \"Tupandactylus\", by Kellner and Campos. Unwin and Martill found that \"T. imperator\" and \"T. navigans\" belong in the same genus, and named them \"Ingridia imperator\" and \"I. navigans\", respectively. This genus name honoured Wellnhofer's late wife Ingrid. \n\nBecause \"Tupandactylus\" was named first, it retained priority over the name \"Ingridia\". To complicate matters, both the name \"Tupandactylus\" and \"Ingridia\" used the former \"Tapejara imperator\" as their type species. The scientists who described \"Tupandactylus\" did not name a \"Tupandactylus navigans\" (but instead suggested it was synonymous to \"Tupandactylus imperator\"), and \"Tapejara navigans\" was not formally reclassified as a distinct species of \"Tupandactylus\" until 2011.\nThe cladogram below follows the 2014 analysis Andres and colleagues.\n\nComparisons between the scleral rings of \"Tapejara\" and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.\n\n"}

His character works as Assistant Trailer Park Supervisor and Weekend Trailer Park Superviser. His character, Randy, is in an on-again/off-again relationship with the Trailer Park Supervisor Jim Lahey (John Dunsworth), whom he always calls Mr. Lahey. Lahey is largely dependant on his assistant for his daily care. Roach has commented in an interview that Randy is gay, though the show portrays the character as bisexual.\n\nHe was also in the original \"Trailer Park Boys\" short film before it was made into a series. His character was the basis for Randy, but was named Patrick and wore a shirt. In between shooting the show, Roach and Dunsworth travelled across Canada performing at comedy clubs and other music events as a stand-up/improv act. After Dunsworth's death in 2017, Roach created his own stand-up comedy show called Randy's Cheeseburger Picnic.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Roach worked at Investors Group as a personal finance consultant.

(21 December 182823 November 1905) was an English physiologist born near Newcastle upon Tyne, and a member of a well known Northumbrian family.\n\nHe was born at Jesmond near Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 21 December 1828 the son of Richard Burdon (1791-1865) and his wife Elizabeth Sanderson. His paternal grandfather was Sir Thomas Burdon.\n\nHe received his medical education at the University of Edinburgh and at Paris. Settling in London, he became Medical Officer of Health for Paddington in 1856 and four years later physician to the Middlesex Hospital and the Brompton Consumption hospitals.\n\nWhen diphtheria appeared in England in 1858 he was sent to investigate the disease at the different points of outbreak, and in subsequent years he carried out a number of similar inquiries, e.g. into the cattle plague and into cholera in 1866. In 1871, he reported that \"Penicillium\" inhibited the growth of bacteria, an observation which places him among the forerunners of Alexander Fleming. He became first principal of the Brown Institution at Lambeth in 1871, and in 1874 was appointed Jodrell Professor of Physiology at University College London, retaining that post until 1882. When the Waynflete Chair of Physiology was established at Oxford in 1882, he was chosen to be its first occupant, and immediately found himself the object of a furious anti-vivisectionist agitation. The proposal that the university should spend a large amount of money providing him with a suitable laboratory, lecture rooms, etc., in which to carry on his work, was strongly opposed, by some on grounds of economy, but largely because he was an upholder of the usefulness and necessity of experiments upon animals. It was, however, eventually carried by a small majority (88 to 85), and in the same year the Royal Society awarded him a Royal Medal in recognition of his researches into the electrical phenomena exhibited by plants and the relations of minute organisms to disease, and of the services he had rendered to physiology and pathology. In 1885 the University of Oxford was asked to vote £500 a year for three years for the purposes of the laboratory, then approaching completion. This proposal was fought with the utmost bitterness by Sanderson's opponents, the anti-vivisectionists including E. A. Freeman, John Ruskin and Bishop Mackarness of Oxford. Ultimately the money was granted by 412 to 244 votes.\n\nIn 1895 Sanderson was appointed Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, resigning the post in 1904. In 1899 he was created a Baronet, of Banbury Road in the Parish of Saint Giles in the City of Oxford. His attainments, both in biology and medicine, brought him many honours. He was Croonian Lecturer to the Royal Society in 1867 and 1877 and to the Royal College of Physicians in 1891. He gave the Harveian Oration before the College of Physicians in 1878, acted as President of the British Association at Nottingham in 1893 and served on three Royal Commissions: on Hospitals (1883), on Tuberculosis, Meat and Milk (1890), and on a University for London (1892).\n\nIn February 1902 he received the honorary degree Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from the Victoria University of Manchester, in connection with the 50th jubilee celebrations of the establishment of the university.\n\nHe died in Oxford on 23 November 1905. He is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford.\n\nIn 1853 he married the author Ghetal Herschell, daughter of Ridley Haim Herschell. His wife wrote his biography.

Between 1990-92, he was Speaker of the People's Assembly of Republika Srpska. Between June and December 1992, he also served as member of the expanded Presidency of Republika Srpska.\n\nAfter the Bosnian War, he was elected Serb member of the tripartite Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the September 1996 and served in that post from October 1996 to October 1998. He lost his bid for re-election in 1998 to Živko Radišić. In 2006, Krajišnik was found guilty of committing crimes against humanity during the Bosnian War (1992–95) by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. He was later granted early release on 1 September 2013, and he returned to Republika Srpska.\n\nAn ethnic Serb, Krajišnik was born in Zabrđe, a village near Sarajevo in central Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nOn 15 October 1991, the parliament of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina passed a resolution on the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in spite of strong opposition from Bosnian Serb deputies. Ten days later, the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) formed a Bosnian Serb Assembly, with Momčilo Krajišnik acting as its president. The Bosnian Serb Assembly began establishing parallel government structures.\n\nKrajišnik took part in the negotiations leading to the Dayton agreements. He earned the nickname \"Mr. No\" for his uncompromising stance during negotiations. About that period, Richard Holbrooke noted in his memoirs:\n\nKrajišnik was indicted by the ICTY on various charges of crimes against humanity - namely extermination, murder, persecution, deportation, and forced transfer, murder as a war crime, and genocide - in relation to acts committed in 1992 in Bosnia and Herzegovina by Bosnian Serb forces. He was arrested on 3 April 2000 at Pale by French naval commandos which were part of SFOR.\n\nOn 27 September 2006 Krajišnik was convicted of the following crimes against humanity: extermination, murder, persecution, deportation, and forced transfer. He was acquitted of the charges of murder as a war crime, genocide, and complicity in genocide. He was sentenced to 27 years imprisonment.\n\nICTY judges found that Krajišnik had been part of a joint criminal enterprise which carried out the extermination, murder, persecution and deportation of non-Serbs during the Bosnian war between 1992 and 1995.\n\nJudge Alphons Orie observed that \"Krajišnik's role in the commission of the crimes was crucial ... His positions within the Bosnian Serb leadership gave him the authority to facilitate the military, police and paramilitary groups to implement the objective of the joint criminal enterprise\". He noted \"Mr Krajišnik... accepted that a heavy price of suffering, death and destruction was necessary to achieve Serb domination.\"\n\nKrajišnik was acquitted of genocide or complicity in genocide on the grounds that the court had found no evidence of a genocidal intent on his part to destroy in full or part ethnic or religious communities. This decision was greeted with anger by representatives of victims of crimes of which Krajišnik had been found guilty, who found his acquittal on the charge of genocide difficult to accept. Bakira Hasečić of the Association of Women Victims of War, an organisation which campaigns for the prosecution of those responsible for the use of rape as a weapon of war that was a feature of the ethnic cleansing campaign, commented that \"The sentence is a major blow to justice. It is an insult for the victims.\"\n\nOn 17 March 2009 the charges of murder and extermination were dropped and the sentence was reduced to 20 years. While the ICTY judges found that while there was evidence that crimes committed in Bosnia constituted the criminal act of genocide (\"actus reus\"), they did not establish that the accused possessed genocidal intent, or was part of a criminal enterprise that had such an intent (\"mens rea\").\n\nAccording to Edina Bećirević, both Krajišnik and Radovan Karadžić were warned by Bosnian Serb military commander General Ratko Mladić, also indicted on genocide charges, that their \"plans\" could not be committed without committing genocide:\n\nIn 2009, Krajišnik was transferred to the UK under the UK's enforcement agreements with the ICTY to serve his sentence at HM Prison Belmarsh. In 2010, after a single year in prison, he filed a request for early release, which was rejected, as in practice the ICTY considers early release only after two thirds of the original sentence is served, unlike the UK where it is often considered after only half of the sentence is served.\n\nIn 2011, another request for early release was made, according to Krajišnik's brother, Mirko, in response to a British government initiative. Krajišnik said that the ICTY had received a proposal from the UK's Ministry of Justice that Momčilo Krajišnik, as a person serving a sentence in the UK, should apply for premature release based on the fact that he had served half his sentence. He had at that point been in prison both at The Hague and then in the UK since 3 April 2000.\n\nOn 1 September 2013, he was released from prison and went back to Republika Srpska after being granted early release by ICTY President Theodor Meron, having served two thirds of his 20 year sentence. After arriving in Banja Luka, a government helicopter flew him home to his wartime stronghold of Pale, where thousands of people welcomed him home. His supporters arrived by bus from across Republika Srpska and convoys of cars were on the streets of Pale with people waving Serbian flags, honking horns, and stopping at the main square as Serb nationalist songs were played. He then told reporters: \"It's like a dream. You have no idea how beautiful this country is\". He added that he was surprised by his welcome, as \"after all, I am 'a war criminal'\".\n\n"}

Its western terminus is at its interchange with U.S. Route 30 (US 30) near Delphos, and its eastern terminus is at its interchange with US 30 in Mansfield. Its current route takes it through the cities of Lima, Kenton, Marion, Galion, and Ontario; as well as the villages of Elida and Caledonia.\n\nWithin the city of Lima, SR 309 is officially designated along SR 81 (North Street) from Jameson Avenue to Union Street, south along Union Street (concurrent with SR 65, and east along Elm Street (SR 117). The eastbound direction of SR 309 is signed south along Jameson Street to SR 117, then east along it while the westbound direction is signed along Central Avenue and Front Street.\n\nSR 309's current route was the route of U.S. Route 30S, a divided U.S. route of US 30 until November 1973 when what was US 30N became the mainline of US 30. US 30S was so numbered in the 1920s to avoid conflict from local business owners worried about the diversion of traffic from their shops along the southern route.\n\nThe only significant change of the route since this certification is its western terminus, which originally was with U.S. 30 in Delphos. When U.S. 30's bypass around Delphos was completed in 1981, Ohio 309's western terminus was made the easternmost interchange of the bypass.\n\nBefore being used as its current route, the route number 309 was used as the route number of what is now State Route 541. It was replaced with the now defunct State Route 271 in 1935.\n\nThe Lincoln Highway left the present State Route 309, a better-quality road at the time, in favor of the direct Delphos-Mansfield route now generally followed by US 30. Only two weeks after the official route was announced in September 1913, it had already been redefined to a straighter path between Lima and Galion; the rest of the straightening came later. The towns along the route got together and formed the Harding Highway, named after President Warren G. Harding, who had grown up in the area.\n\nThis Harding Highway continued east via the Lincoln Highway to Canton, turning southeast from there to Steubenville via State Route 43. To the west, it was marked along the Lincoln Highway to Van Wert, heading west along the present U.S. Route 224, roughly State Road 114, State Road 10, State Road 8, and State Road 2 through Indiana to the Illinois state line.\n\n"}

A swagger stick is shorter than a staff or cane, and is usually made from rattan. Its use derives from the vine staff carried by Roman centurions as an emblem of office.\n\nIn the British Army before World War I, swagger sticks were carried by all other ranks when off duty, as part of their walking out uniform. The stick took the form of a short cane of polished wood, with an ornamented metal head of regimental pattern. The usual custom was for the private soldier or NCO to carry the stick tucked under his arm. Cavalrymen carried a small riding cane instead of the swagger stick of infantry and other branches. This practice was restricted to the army and Royal Marines, and was never imitated by the other services, although T. E. Lawrence when he had enlisted in the Royal Air Force under the name of Ross, mentions that airmen under training at the RAF Depot at Uxbridge carried swagger sticks. It is thought that this practice was limited to the Depot.\n\nUntil 1939 swagger sticks were still carried by peacetime regular soldiers when \"walking out\" of barracks but the practice ceased with the outbreak of World War II. Uniforms are no longer worn by British army personnel when off-duty and the swagger stick has accordingly become obsolete.\n\nIn the British Army and other military forces following the Commonwealth traditions, commissioned officers of most infantry regiments formerly carried swagger sticks (described as canes) when on duty, whilst Warrant Officers and Senior NCOs carried pace sticks instead. This practice continues in some regiments, especially by Warrant Officers when in Barrack Dress. Cavalry officers would often carry a riding crop rather than a swagger stick, in deference to their mounted traditions. In some Irish regiments in the British army, such as the Irish Guards, officers carried a blackthorn walking stick, based on the shillelagh. In the Royal Tank Regiment, officers carried an 'ash plant' or walking stick instead, in reference to World War I tank attacks, when officers would prepare lines of advance by testing the ground's firmness and suitability for tanks.\n\nSwagger sticks were once in vogue in the United States Marine Corps, starting as an informal accessory carried by officers in the late 19th century. In 1915, it gained official approval as recruiters were encouraged to carry them to improve their public image. This tradition grew when Marines deployed for World War I encountered European officers carrying swagger sticks, leading to an entry in the uniform regulations in 1922 authorizing enlisted Marines to carry them as well. The usage died down in the 1930s and 40s, with the exception of China Marines, and came back into vogue with a 1952 regulation encouraging them, reaching a peak from 1956 to 1960 when on 4 January 1960, the Commandant, General David M. Shoup, commented on their use with regard to Uniforms and Equipment.\nThere is one item of equipment about which I have a definite opinion. It is the swagger stick. It shall remain an optional item of interference. If you feel the need of it, carry it…\n\nFew, if any, contemporary officers carry a swagger stick, and it has no official sanction in any branch.\n\nGeneral George S. Patton carried a swagger stick throughout World War II; however, his contained a concealed blade, similar to a Victorian gentleman's sword cane.\n\nGeneral Paul D. Harkins, United States commander in Vietnam from 1962 to 1964, habitually carried a swagger stick.\n\nGeneral William J. Livsey, who was the commanding general of the Eighth United States Army in South Korea from 1984 to 1987, publicly carried a swagger stick that was carved from wood collected from the poplar tree at the center of the Axe Murder Incident.\n\n\n"}

It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Liverpool, the archdeaconry of Liverpool, and the deanery of Toxteth and Wavertree. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It was described by John Betjeman as \"Liverpool's best Georgian church\".\n\nHoly Trinity was built in 1794 as a chapel of ease to All Saints' Church, Childwall, and was designed by John Hope. The church was consecrated on 5 August 1794 by Rt Revd William Cleaver, bishop of Chester. It became a separate parish in its own right in 1867. In 1911 the church was reordered, and the east end was rebuilt, by Charles Reilly. At the east end he added a bay and an apse, creating a chancel. The north and south galleries were removed, and a baptistery was created at the base of the tower. In the 1950s the tower was found to be unstable, and its upper parts, consisting of superimposed cupolas, were removed. In 1961, and again in 1971, the church had to be restored following serious fires.\n\nThe church is constructed in stone with a slate roof. The body of the church is in Georgian style, and the east end is Neoclassical. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave, an apsidal chancel, and a west tower containing the baptistry. The tower has a west window (which was formerly a door), above which is a circular window and decorated panels. Towards the top of the tower are diamond-shaped clock faces on all sides, and on the top is the base of the truncated cupola. Along the sides of the church are windows in two tiers, the lower ones having segmental heads, and the larger upper ones having round heads. Attached to the tower are large buttresses in the form of obelisks. In each west bay is an entrance with a pediment on a bracket. At the east end there is also a pedimented entrance on both sides, above which is a rectangular window with an architrave, a frieze, and a cornice. In the apse are three round-headed windows.\n\nInside the church is a west gallery carried on quatrefoil iron columns. The nave ceiling is flat with a central rose, the baptistry has a saucer-shaped dome, and the apse is vaulted. In the chancel are large pilasters rising to pillars, forming lateral spaces which include a vestry and an organ chamber. Above the entrances to these are pediments surmounted by urns. The marble font has a shallow bowl, the pulpit is square and panelled with a dentilled cornice, and the shaft of the lectern consists of a fluted Greek Doric column; all these are in Neoclassical style. The pipe organ was built in 1972 by J. W. Walker.\n\nIn the churchyard is a war memorial dating from about 1920. It is constructed in Portland stone, and was designed by H. Tyson Smith. The upright has a rectangular section, and the cross arms are short. It is flanked by female figures clothed in classical drapery holding laurel leaves, and standing on a rendered pyramidal plinth. On the front of the memorial is a panel carrying an inscription, and on the back is a relief of a pelican feeding her young. The memorial is listed at Grade II*. The churchyard also contains the war graves of 11 British service personnel of World War I and 17 of World War II.\n\n"}

The city is located on the Brahmaputra River, about north of Dhaka the capital of the country. It is a major financial center and 'Educational district' of North Central Bangladesh and the 4th largest city in Bangladesh. Border area cover Himalayan state of India, Gazipur District, Tangail District, Jamalpur District, Netrokona District, Kishoreganj District. Mymensingh is the 8th administrative divisional headquarter and 12th City corporation of Bangladesh. According to Ministry of Public Administration, Mymensingh is ranked 4th in district status. The density of Mymensingh city is 44,458/km (115,150/sq mi) which is the second most densely populated city in Bangladesh. Mymensingh attracts 25 percent of health tourists visiting Bangladesh. Mymensingh is the anglicised pronunciation of the original name \"Momenshahi\", referring to a Muslim ruler called Shah Momin. Its elevation is over 19 m above sea level, the highest of Bangladesh's major cities. Mymensingh related with old Brahmaputra river, handcrafted duvet called \"Nakshikantha\" () and a rural ballad called Maimansingha Gitika\n\nThe cadet college established in Tangail in 1963 was called Momenshahi Cadet College. The city is known for educational institutions. Other landmark institutions include Momenshahi Cantonment, Mymensingh, once the HQ of 19th Infantry Division and now the Headquarters of ARTDOC..\n\nMymensingh is one of the 16 old districts of Bangladesh which was constituted by the British East India Company on 1 May 1787. Being more than 220 years old, Mymensingh has a rich cultural and political history. In the beginning, Begunbari was chosen as the headquarters of the district. However, the district headquarters was relocated to Mymensingh when Begunbari devastated by a flash flood. Earlier Mymensingh was called Nasirabad, after Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah. During the British Raj most of the inhabitants of the town were Hindus..During the British, this district was ruled by Banik Zamindars who moved to India during Partition.\n\nFrom the early 20th century Muslims moved into town. Since then this city has played an important role as a centre for secularism. The Vidyamoyee Uccha Balika Bidyalaya and Muminunnesa Women's College have played a great role in educating Bengali Muslim women. A majority of first-generation successful Bangladeshi women have attended these schools and colleges, including the first woman justice of the High Court of Bangladesh, Justice Nazmun Ara Sultana. However, many Hindu families left Bangladesh during the partition of India in 1947. A second spell of Exodus took place following the Indo-Pak war of 1965. Many people born and raised Mymensingh have left for West Bengal since the 1960s. The exodus continues albeit at a slower pace.\nThe nine-month liberation war of Bangladesh started on 27 March 1971. Mymensingh remained free from the occupation army until 23 April 1971. Pakistani occupation forces deserted Mymensingh on 10 December, and Mukti Bahini took over on 11 December, just five days ahead of the victory of Dhaka on 16 December.\n\nThe city has no officially defined geographical limits. Since the 1980s the city has expanded with fast urbanisation. Mymensingh city is clearly marked by the old Brahmaputra river flowing along its north. Shambhuganj is situated on the other side of the Brahmaputra, connected by the Shambhuganj Bridge. Other ends of the city are marked respectively by the beginning of the Agricultural University campus, the Medical College, Army cantonment and, finally, Sultanabad, a township built for the followers of Aga Khan. A railway line connecting Dhaka with northern districts, built between 1885 and 1899, passes through the city and divides it into two sides.\n\nThe climate of Mymensingh is moderate, much cooler than Dhaka, as it is closer to the Himalayas. The monsoon starts in May or June and continues till August. It rains heavily and sometimes for days and weeks. During the monsoon, the temperature varies between 15 and 20 degrees. The temperature falls below in winter which is spread over December and January and may well include November and February. The highest temperature is felt during April–May period, when the temperature may be as high as . High humidity causes heavy sweating during this period. For western travellers, the best time to visit is between November and February.\n\nHistorically, Mymensingh district was known for jute production which was termed 'golden fibre' due to revenue it generated as a cash crop.

{"id": "2274477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274477", "title": "Trustee from the Toolroom", "text": "Trustee from the Toolroom\n\nTrustee from the Toolroom is a novel written by Nevil Shute. Shute died in January 1960; \"Trustee\" was published posthumously later that year.\n\nThe plot of the novel hinges on the actions of a modest technical journalist, Keith Stewart, whose life has been focused on the design and engineering of small and scale-model precision machinery. Stewart writes serial articles about how to build miniature machines in a magazine called the \"Miniature Mechanic\", which are extremely well regarded in the modelling community — as is he.\n\nKeith's sister had married a wealthy naval officer, recently retired from service at the opening of the story. The couple plan a long pleasure cruise in their small yacht before settling in British Columbia, meanwhile leaving their 10-year-old daughter with Keith and his wife. Before leaving, they ask Keith for assistance in hiding a jewelry box in the yacht's concrete ballast. When the couple are killed in a shipwreck in French Polynesia, Keith becomes the permanent guardian and trustee of his niece (hence the title). But, the solicitor handling the estate finds that the money has disappeared; the evidence suggests that Keith's brother-in-law converted his wealth into diamonds to take with him abroad in order to evade export and currency restrictions intended to prevent capital leaving Britain.\n\nKeith infers that the metal box he secreted contained the diamonds, and he starts to investigate how he may retrieve them from the wreck. It is a difficult problem. Keith, while not poor, has chosen to do work he loves in place of better-paying work, and cannot afford to travel to Polynesia. He is able to call on connections in the model engineering world to deadhead his way on a flight as far as Hawaii. Finding no conventional way to get further which is within his means, he takes passage on the hand-built sailing ship of an illiterate half-Polynesian from Oregon, Jack Donelly.\n\nOne of the aircrew who took Keith to Hawaii worriedly approaches Keith's editor on his return to England. The editor, somewhat shocked at the risks that Keith is taking, starts trawling the close-knit world of miniature mechanics for someone who could help Keith. Eventually, Mr. Solomon Hirzhorn, who runs a vast timber business near Tacoma, Washington, is informed. Hirzhorn, an inexperienced modeller, has sent lengthy letters asking for elementary clarifications of Keith's modelling articles, which Keith always patiently answered. Hirzhorn is currently building one of Keith's designs, a Congreve clock, and jumps at the chance to help him in return. Hirzhorn arranges for the yacht of a business associate, Chuck Ferris, to proceed to Tahiti to help Keith out. Coincidentally, Keith and Jack had already consulted the yacht's captain for navigation advice in Honolulu.\n\nKeith and Jack arrive safely in Tahiti but are in danger of being thrown into jail due to not having proper ship's papers. The yacht captain smooths over the situation, and brings Keith to the island where the wreck is located.\nThere he meditates on the fate that has brought him so far, takes many pictures, erects a headstone, and salvages the yacht's engine, which he arranges to ship back to Britain to sell.\nAfter an amusing incident where Ferris's much-married daughter, Dawn, runs off with Jack Donelly, the yacht proceeds to Washington State. Keith spends several days visiting Hirzhorn, helping him with his model. After Keith catches an engineering error in the contract between Hirzhorn's company and Ferris's that might have cost a couple of million dollars, Hirzhorn arranges for a large consultancy fee to be paid by Ferris's company and has his own company pay Stewart's airfare home.\n\nThe consultancy fee enables Keith's wife to stop working and take care of their niece. The diamonds are \"discovered\" by Keith in the oil in the engine's sump soon after it arrives, and proceeds from their sale enable them to take care of their niece's education and other needs. The other characters proceed on their lives happily, we are told at the end of what is probably Shute's most villain-free novel.\n\nThe book is well loved by tool lovers, especially engineers and model engineers, for its reverent treatment of machinery, tools, and craftsmanship. The fictional magazine \"Miniature Mechanic\" is based on the actual British magazine, \"Model Engineer\", and Shute himself admitted that the novel's protagonist is inspired by an author of that magazine, Edgar T. Westbury. The novel's plot is not especially complex, nor is the novel's mystery terribly well hidden: the tension and drama of the story are generated by suspecting the outcome but not knowing how it will be achieved.\n\nTwo contrasts are regularly apparent throughout the book. The first is between the seriousness with which the craft of model engineering is treated by its practitioners, and the physical scale of operations (which in today's language might be dismissed as \"boys' toys\"). Naturally, only the non-technical characters find this contrast amusing, since to an engineer the ultimate seriousness is that what he designs works, and Shute was a professional engineer. The other contrast is between Keith Stewart's generally low estimation of his own abilities and the high esteem in which he is held by engineers worldwide. \"Not \"the\" Keith Stewart?\" is the amusing recurrent response when one engineer introduces him to another on his journey. \"A very competent student of engineering matters\" is how Shute the neutral narrator describes him, \"though he would have been amazed to hear himself described in those terms.\"\n\nThe novel represents a more liberal view of sexual conduct than we see in Shute's earlier books. The affair between Donelly and Dawn Ferris is accepted with amusement or resignation by most of the characters. In earlier books, such as \"A Town Like Alice\", premarital sex was deprecated.\n\nSeveral of the novel's characters come from groups subject to prejudice. The Hirzhorn family is Jewish, as is the diamond merchant Elias Franck. Jack Donelly is a 'coloured' American who is also illiterate and mentally 'deficient', although a talented boat-builder and sailor. The hero, Keith Stewart, is a 'working class' mechanic, although an extremely talented one. All four characters are portrayed in a positive light.\n\n\"Trustee from the Toolroom\" was voted #27 on the Modern Library Readers' list of the top 100 novels. The top ten in that poll included four works by Ayn Rand and three by L. Ron Hubbard and according to David Ebershoff, Modern Library's publishing director, \"the voting population [was] skewed.\"\n\nShute describes Keith Stewart and his wife as living in the very house in South Ealing, London, where Shute himself was born and brought up. There is a faithful description of the property and of the modest way of life that went on there.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2274481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274481", "title": "Psych-Out", "text": "Psych-Out\n\nPsych-Out is a 1968 counterculture-era psychedelic film about hippies, psychedelic music, and recreational drugs starring Susan Strasberg, Jack Nicholson (the film's leading man despite being billed under supporting player Dean Stockwell), and Bruce Dern, and produced and released by American International Pictures. Originally scripted as \"The Love Children\", the title when tested caused people to think it was about bastards, so Samuel Z. Arkoff came up with the ultimate title based on a recent successful reissue of \"Psycho\". The cinematographer was László Kovács.\n\nDirector Richard Rush's cut came in at 101 minutes and was edited to 82 minutes by the producers. This version is the one released on DVD. For some reason, when HBO Video released the film on VHS, they used a 98-minute version. On February 17, 2015 a 101-minute Director's cut was released on DVD and Blu-Ray. The majority of the songs in the movie and on the original soundtrack album were performed by the Storybook. This credit is never mentioned on movie posters and articles. They were a local band from the San Fernando Valley.\n\nJenny (played by Susan Strasberg) is a deaf runaway who arrives in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, searching for her brother Steve. She encounters Stoney (Jack Nicholson) and his hippie band \"Mumblin' Jim\" in a coffee shop. The boys are sympathetic, especially when they discover that she is deaf and uses lip reading. They hide her from the police and help her look for her brother. She has a postcard from him which reads \"Jess Saes: God is alive and well and living in a sugar cube\". The band is approached by a promoter who arranges for them to perform at \"the Ballroom\".\n\nArtist Warren (Henry Jaglom), who designs the psychedelic posters advertising the band, freaks out badly in his gallery, apparently on STP. He sees everyone, including himself, as walking dead and his own hand as festering), trying to cut it off with a circular saw. While they help him, Jenny notices a large sculpture resembling abstract flames in a corner and recognizes it as her brother's work. The gallery owner says the artist is known as \"The Seeker\", an itinerant preacher. Ex-band member Dave (Dean Stockwell) may know The Seeker's current whereabouts.\n\nDave left the band because he felt they were too concerned with worldly success, rather than serious focus on music for its own sake. His information leads the gang to a junkyard. Nearby is a sign reading \"Jess Saes\" -- \"Jesus Saves\", with some letters missing. The \"sugar cube\" slogan is painted on the side of a car which Jenny recognizes as her brother's. However, a group of thugs who frequent the junkyard accost the group. They have it in for The Seeker. They dislike his street preaching and his themes of love and peace. They threaten to rape Jenny. Violence ensues, and the group barely escape with their lives.\n\nJenny's friendship with Stoney has become sexual. She does not know his reputation for one-night stands and lack of commitment. She attends a mock funeral staged by a large group of hippies, with background music by The Seeds; the theme of their play is that death is not the end, and that love and a refusal to hurt others are what keep us alive. In Stoney's crowded home, everyday hippie life is less than ideal. The residents are all involved in contemplation, sex, sleeping, dancing, or decorating, but little cleaning or maintenance. Jenny tries to wash the mountain of dishes in the kitchen and finds that the plumbing is broken, but everybody just continues dancing. Frustrated, she interrupts Stoney's band practice to inform him she is going to take a walk. He answers angrily that he has no leash on her. Dave, sitting quietly in the next room, is distressed at the way Stoney treats Jenny. Concerned in spite of himself, Stoney later goes to find her. He ends up at the art gallery, where he hears breaking glass and slips inside.\n\nThe Seeker (Bruce Dern) has returned to the art gallery to pick up his sculpture. Challenged by Stoney, he pleads that the work should not be touched; it is actually not art, but a shrine he created on God's request. He is glad Jenny is looking for him, but says he is on drugs and wants to be sober when they meet. Jenny's deafness is pathological; their mother was cruelly abusive, and burned Jenny's beloved toys. Jenny was violently traumatized and apparently had a stroke; she was deaf from that moment.\n\nThe performance at the Ballroom is a success; Mumblin' Jim play, along with the Strawberry Alarm Clock. Steve the Seeker shows up, hoping to see Jenny, but the junkyard thugs are also present and chase him back to his home. Steve runs right behind Jenny without her noticing, since she hears nothing. At an after-show party Dave remonstrates Stoney over his ambition for commercial success, as well as his cavalier treatment of Jenny. Stoney saunters off with another woman, and Dave consoles Jenny. She sees him put STP in some fruit juice. He offers himself to her, but Stoney charges in and angrily shouts at Jenny, calling her a \"bitch\". Heartbroken, Jenny accepts Dave's glass of fruit juice and drinks nearly all of it.\n\nShe again explains her search for Steve, and Dave pulls a note from his pocket: \"God is in the flame,\" and an address. Jenny runs out and takes a streetcar. Stoney rouses Dave, now tripping on STP, to help find her. Pursued by the junkyard thugs back to his home, Steve lights a fire inside his shrine. Soon the entire house is ablaze. Jenny arrives to find a crowd gathering near the house; she runs in just in time to see him standing in the middle of the flames, absorbed in prayer; he sees her, but merely smiles and waves.\n\nIn her grief and confusion, she runs up to the roof, hallucinating wildly. She apparently jumps into a reservoir. She then sees fire bombs heading towards her barely missing her. She is standing in the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge, cars coming at her from both directions with their horns blaring. She holds her hands over her ears. Dave and Stoney find her. Dave shoves her out of the way of an oncoming car and is struck and killed. As he dies, he murmurs that he hopes this, too, will be a good trip. Sickened and angry, Jenny tries to leave, but Stoney embraces her. The film ends with the two holding each other and crying, while an image of the mock funeral reappears.\n\n\nDick Clark produced the film. He later wrote in his memoirs that he insisted the film have an anti drug message \"because I'd seen the kids in the hippie commune living in awful squalor.\"\n\nHe wrote in 1976 \"if you saw it [the film] today you'd say it was a reasonably accurate account of what was going on then.\"\n\nThe film was originally called \"The Love Children\". Clark says the title was changed at the request of distributors who worried people might think it was \"a film about bastards\".\n\nThe special effects on the film were created by the stunt coordinator Gary Kent.\n\n\"Psych-Out\" was released on DVD by Fox Video (distributing for MGM) on April 15, 2003 under the 'Midnite Movies' brand as a two-sided DVD, with the other side containing \"The Trip\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2274504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274504", "title": "French verbs", "text": "French verbs\n\nFrench verbs are a part of speech in French grammar. Each verb lexeme has a collection of finite and non-finite forms in its conjugation scheme.\n\nFinite forms depend on grammatical tense and person/number. There are eight simple tense–aspect–mood forms, categorized into the indicative, subjunctive and imperative moods, with the conditional mood sometimes viewed as an additional category. The eight simple forms can also be categorized into four tenses (future, present, past, and future-of-the-past), or into two aspects (perfective and imperfective).\n\nThe three non-finite moods are the infinitive, past participle, and present participle.\n\nThere are compound constructions that use more than one verb. These include one for each simple tense with the addition of or as an auxiliary verb. There is also a construction which is used to distinguish passive voice from active voice.\n\nFrench verbs are conjugated by isolating the stem of the verb and adding an ending. In the first and second conjugation, the stem is easily identifiable from the infinitive, and remains essentially constant throughout the paradigm. For example, the stem of (\"speak\") is \"parl-\" and the stem of (\"finish\") is \"fin-\". In the third group, the relationship between the infinitive form and the stem is less consistent, and several distinct stems are needed to produce all the forms in the paradigm. For example, the verb (\"drink\") has the stems \"boi-\", \"boiv-\", \"bu-\", and \"buv-\".\n\nThe ending depends on the mood, tense, aspect, and voice of the verb, as well as on the person and number of its subject. Every conjugation exhibits some degree of syncretism, where the same (homophonous, and possibly also homographic) form is used to realize distinct combinations of grammatical features. This is most noticeable for \"-er\" verbs. For instance, the conjugated form \"parle\" can be the 1st or 3rd person singular indicative or subjunctive form of \"parler\", or the singular familiar imperative. Furthermore, the 2nd person singular indicative and subjunctive form \"parles\" and the 3rd person plural form \"parlent\" are pronounced the same way as \"parle\" (except in liaison contexts). The prevalence of syncretism in conjugation paradigms is one functional explanation for the fact that French does not allow null subjects, unlike most of the other Romance languages.\n\nAside from and (considered categories unto themselves), French verbs are traditionally grouped into three \"conjugation classes\" (\"groupes\"):\n\nAs with English verbs, French verbs have both non-finite moods (\"les modes impersonnels\"), also called verbals, and finite ones (\"les modes personnels\").\n\nThe finite moods are the indicative (\"l'indicatif\"), the imperative (\"l'impératif\"), and the subjunctive (\"le subjonctif\"). As discussed below, sometimes the conditional is recognized as a fourth mood. While the rules that determine the correct mood are quite complex, they are simplified and summarized in the following table:\n\nMany linguists recognize a fourth mood, the conditional (\"le conditionnel\"), which is used in almost exactly the same circumstances as the conditional in English. In French, « Je le \"ferais\" si j'avais assez de temps » is \"I \"would do\" it if I had enough time\" in English. The conditional can also be used evidentially, to express reservations about the verb: « Il \"serait\" suivi par un psychologue », \"He \"is apparently/is said to be/\"[etc.] under the care of a psychologist.\" Other linguists consider the conditional to be a tense of the indicative mood. The two camps do not disagree on the rules for when and how to use the conditional. A third camp recognizes both \"conditionnel présent/conditionnel passé\" (for use in conditional sentences), and \"indicatif futur du passé / indicatif futur antérieur du passé\" (for tense concords, \"future from a past point of view\"; e.g. « Il m'a dit qu'il le \"ferait\" le lendemain », \"He told me he \"would do\" it the next day\"), but they recognize also that both are conjugated the same.\n\n\nThe indicative mood has five \"simple\" (synthetic) tense-aspect forms, conveying four tenses (times of action) (future, present, past, and future-of-past) and two aspects (fabrics of time) (perfective, conveying an action viewed in its entirety without its time frame being considered in more detail, and imperfective, conveying an action that occurs repeatedly or continuously). The tense-aspect forms of the indicative mood in French are called the present (\"le présent\": present tense, imperfective aspect), the simple past (\"le passé simple\": past tense, perfective aspect), the imperfect (\"l'imparfait\": past tense, imperfective aspect), the future (\"le futur\": future tense, unspecified aspect), and the conditional (\"le conditionnel\": future-in-past tense, unspecified aspect). Note that, as discussed above, in some uses the conditional can be considered a separate mood completely, while in other uses it is the future-in-past tense of the indicative. The use of the various tense forms is described in the following table:\n\nAdditionally, the indicative has five compound (two-word) tense-aspect forms, each of which is formed analogously to the perfect in languages such as English (e.g., \"have done\") (though in French this form does not indicate the perfect aspect) as applied to one of the above simple tense forms. These tense forms are used to indicate events before the corresponding simple tense forms; for example, « À ce moment-là, il se souvint de ce qu'il \"avait promis\" » (\"At that moment, he remembered what he had promised\"). In addition, except in literature or very formal speeches, the present perfect form is used in modern French wherever the simple past would have been used in older or more literary writing. Since this use is much more common than its use as a true present perfect, it is usually called the compound past (\"le passé composé\"). Further, where older or more literary French would have used the perfect form of the simple past tense (\"le passé antérieur\") for the past-of-the-past, modern non-literary French uses the pluperfect (\"le plus-que-parfait\"; the perfect of the imperfect), or sometimes a new form called the \"surcomposé\" (literally, \"over-compound\"), which re-applies the perfect to the compound past, resulting in a structure like « Je l'\"ai eu fait\" » (literally, \"I it \"have had done\"\").\n\nUnlike English or Spanish, French does not mark for a continuous aspect. Thus, \"I am doing it\" (continuous) and \"I do it\" both translate to the same sentence in French: « Je le fais. » However, the distinction is often clear from context; and when not, it can be conveyed using periphrasis; for example, the expression \"être en train de <nowiki>[faire quelque chose]</nowiki>\" (\"to be in the middle of <nowiki>[doing something]</nowiki>\") is often used to convey the sense of a continuous aspect. (For example, \"I am doing it\" might be expressed as « Je suis en train de le faire », \"I am in the middle of doing it.\") In the case of the past tense, neither the simple nor the compound past tense is ever used with a continuous sense; therefore, the imperfect often indicates a continuous sense (though it does have other uses, as discussed above).\n\nSimilarly to English, the verb (\"to go\") can be used as an auxiliary verb to create a near-future tense (\"le futur proche\"). Whereas English uses the continuous aspect (\"to be going\"), French uses the simple present tense; for example, the English sentence \"I am going to do it tomorrow\" would in French be « Je \"vais\" le \"faire\" demain ». As in English, this form can generally be replaced by the present or future tense: \"I am doing it tomorrow\", \"I shall do it tomorrow\", « Je le \"fais\" demain », « Je le ferai demain ».\n\nMuch like the use of (\"to go\") to create a near-future tense, the verb (\"to come\") can be used as an auxiliary verb to create a near-past tense (\"le passé proche\"). As in the near-future tense, the auxiliary verb is in the present tense. Unlike , needs the preposition \"de\" before the infinitive. Hence the English sentence \"I [just] did it a minute ago\" would in French be « Je \"viens de\" le \"faire\" il y a une minute ».\n\nThe subjunctive mood has only two simple tense-aspect forms: a present (\"le présent du subjonctif\") and an imperfect (\"l'imparfait du subjonctif\"). Of these, only the present is used nowadays; like the simple past indicative, the imperfect subjunctive is only found in older and more literary works. When both tense-aspect forms are used, there is no difference in meaning between the two; the present is used in subordinate clauses whose main clauses are in a present or future tense, as well as in the few main clauses that use the subjunctive, and the imperfect is used in subordinate clauses whose main clauses are in a past tense form (other than present perfect). Except in literature and very formal speeches, modern French uses the present subjunctive even where an older or more literary work would use the imperfect subjunctive.\n\nAs with the indicative, the subjunctive also has one compound tense form for each simple tense form. The difference between the present perfect subjunctive (\"le passé du subjonctif\") and the pluperfect subjunctive (\"le plus-que-parfait du subjonctif\") is analogous to the difference between the present subjunctive and imperfect subjunctive; of the two, only the present perfect subjunctive is found in modern French.\nThe subjunctive in French is used almost wherever it would be in English, and in many other situations as well. It is used in \"que\" (\"that\") clauses to indicate emotion, doubt, possibility, necessity, desire, and so forth. For example, as in English one says\n\n\nBut also, unlike in English, the subjunctive is used in, for example,\n\n\nSometimes the subjunctive is used in the interrogative and the negative but not in the affirmative:\n\n\nIn addition to situations of doubt, negatives stated with certainty take the subjunctive:\n\n\nSuperlatives also can optionally be accompanied by the subjunctive in a \"que\" clause, if the speaker feels doubt:\n\n\nFinally, as in English, counterfactual conditions in the past are expressed by backshifting the apparent time reference. In English this backshifted form is called the pluperfect subjunctive, and unless it is expressed in inverted form it is identical in form to the pluperfect indicative; it is called subjunctive because of the change in implied time of action. In French, however, there is a distinction in form between the seldom used pluperfect subjunctive and the pluperfect indicative, which is used in this situation. For example,\n\n\nThe imperative only has a present tense, with a rarely used perfect: \"fais-le\" and \"aie-le fait\" both mean \"do it\", with the latter implying a certain deadline (somewhat like English \"have it done\").\n\nLike English, French has two voices, the unmarked active voice and the marked passive voice. As in English, the passive voice is formed by using the appropriate form of \"to be\" (\"être\") and the past participle of the main verb.\n\nIn French, all compound tense-aspect forms are formed with an auxiliary verb (either \"to be\" or \"to have\"). Most verbs use \"avoir\" as their auxiliary verb. The exceptions are all reflexive verbs and a number of verbs of motion or change of state, including some of the most frequently used intransitive verbs of the language:\n\n\nVerbs that are derived from these by prefixation may continue to select \"être\", but this is not always the case. For example:\n\nA small number of verbs, including some already mentioned above, can in fact be found with either auxiliary (, , , , , , ). There may be a subtle change of meaning depending on the auxiliary chosen, and one auxiliary is usually more literary or archaic than the other.\nThe distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tense-aspect forms and is essential to the agreement of the past participle.\n\nThe past participle is used in three ways in French: as an adjective, in the passive construction, and in the compound tense-aspect constructions. When it is used as an adjective, it follows all the regular adjective agreement rules. In passive constructions, it always agrees with the passive subject.\n\nIn compound tense-aspect forms, more complicated agreement rules apply, reflecting the subtle priority rules between the attribute meaning (which implies an agreement) and the compound tense construction (which by itself does not imply any agreement).\n\nA. The auxiliary verb is \"avoir\".\n\nB. The auxiliary is \"être\", and the verb is not reflexive. The past participle agrees with the subject: \nC. The auxiliary is \"être\" and the verb is reflexive. The agreement rules are in fact the same as those for structures with \"avoir\" in A, keeping in mind that the reflexive pronoun corresponds to either the direct object or the indirect object of the verb.\n\n"}

Hear Music began as a catalog company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1990 before being purchased by Starbucks in 1999.\n\nThe Hear Music brand has four components: the music that each location plays; in-store CD sales, including Starbucks exclusives; branded retail stores, which opened shortly after the catalog was formed, and a label distributing their recordings.\n\nAs of December 2006, there are four Starbucks Hear Music Coffeehouses: Santa Monica, California, on the Third Street Promenade; San Antonio, Texas, on the River Walk; Miami, Florida, on the Lincoln Road shopping promenade; and Bellevue, Washington, in Bellevue Square. The original, now-defunct Hear Music Store was located in Berkeley, California. Ten Starbucks locations also have Hear Music \"media bars,\" a service which uses tablet PCs to allow customers to create their own mix CDs. The media bars are located in Seattle and in Austin, Texas. The music section in Canadian bookstore chain Chapters was at one time licensed version of the Hear Music concept; however, the company no longer uses the brand name.\n\nIts biggest seller was Ray Charles' Grammy-winning \"Genius Loves Company\", with sales of 2.86 million records; 25% of those were sold at Starbucks locations.\n\nIn 2005, Starbucks announced a partnership with singer/songwriter Alanis Morissette. In a six-week deal, Morissette sold an acoustic version of \"Jagged Little Pill\" in Starbucks stores only. The acoustic version was released on June 13, 2005 to mark the album's tenth anniversary. This limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and HMV Canada, who retaliated by removing Morissette's other albums from store shelves for the duration of Starbucks' exclusive sale.\n\nIn April 2008, Starbucks announced that it was refining its entertainment strategy and turning over the day-to-day management of Hear Music to Concord.\n\nAt the same time that Starbucks closed 600 coffeehouses in July 2008, it was announced that the Hear Music label would be shutting down. One of the four Hear Music stores, in Santa Monica, California, has indicated that its music operation will be permanently closed approximately September 20, 2008. Another Hear Music store in Bellevue, Washington has been converted to a regular Starbucks. The Lincoln Road Miami Beach location has since been downgraded as well, since November 2008.\n\nOn March 12, 2007 Starbucks and Concord Music Group launched the Hear Music record label. The company's first artist signing was Paul McCartney, leaving his long-time label EMI on March 21, 2007.\n\nIn July 2007, the label signed Joni Mitchell and announced that her first album of new material in nearly ten years, \"Shine\", would be released on September 25, 2007.\n\nIn March 2008, it was announced that Carly Simon had signed with the label and would be releasing a new album entitled \"This Kind of Love\" in late April 2008, her first collection of original songs since 2000's \"The Bedroom Tapes\". She blamed poor sales on Hear Music's failure to promote the album. She sued the company and lost.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2274525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274525", "title": "Myeloblast", "text": "Myeloblast\n\nThe myeloblast is a unipotent stem cell which differentiates into the effectors of the granulocyte series. It is found in the bone marrow. Stimulation of myeloblasts by G-CSF and other cytokines triggers maturation, differentiation, proliferation and cell survival. \n\nMyeloblasts reside extravascularly in the bone marrow. Hematopoiesis takes place in the extravascular cavities between the sinuses of the marrow. The wall of the sinuses is composed of two different types of cells, endothelial cells and adventitial reticular cells. The hemopoietic cells are aligned in cords or wedges between these sinuses, with myeloblasts and other granular progenitors concentrated in the subcortical regions of these hemopoietic cords.\n\nMyeloblasts are rather small cells with a diameter between 14 and 18μm. The major part is occupied by a large oval nucleus composed of very fine nonaggregated chromatin and possessing 3 or more nucleoli. The cytoplasm has a basophilic character and is devoid of granules, which is a major difference from the myeloblast's successor, the promyelocyte. The nucleolus is the site of assembly of ribosomal proteins, which are located in various particles dispersed over the cytoplasm. Mitochondria are present but have a rather small size.\n\nThe main features that distinguish a myeloblast from a lymphoblast upon microscopic examination are the presence of cytoplasmic granules, the lesser degree of condensation in the nuclear chromatin, and the increased prominence of the nucleoli.\n\nThese cells descend from the primitive reticulum cells, which are found in the stroma of the marrow. There is also an intermediate phase between the myeloblast and these primitive reticulum cells, namely the hemocytoblast. At this time several developing blood cell lines are available, like erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis. Granulopoiesis is regulated by humoral agents, like colony-stimulating factor (CSF) and interleukin 3.\n\nGranulopoiesis consists of 5 stages, in which the myeloblast is the first recognizable cell. Next in the differentiation sequence is the monoblast and the promyelocyte, which can develop into one of three different precursor cells: the neutrophilic, basophilic or eosinophilic myelocyte. This proliferation takes five divisions before the final stage is obtained. These divisions all take place in the first three stages of granulopoiesis.\n\nThe most common problem with malfunctioning myeloblasts is acute myeloblastic leukemia. The main clinical features of acute myeloblastic leukemia are caused by failure of hemopoiesis with anemia, hemorrhage and infection as a result. There is a progressive accumulation of leukemic cells, because some blast progenitor cells renew themselves and have a limited differentiated division. Sometimes acute myeloblastic leukemia can be initiated by earlier hematologic disorders, like myelodysplastic syndrome, pancytopenia, or hypoplasia of the bone marrow.\n\n\n"}

It is yet another story in Gwar's grand storyline (about the ne'er-do-well Scumdogs of the Universe), and the third to be released on video.\n\n\"Skulhedface\" being the movie coinciding with \"This Toilet Earth\", the story of both album and movie are nearly identical (though the album diverges from that story frequently). Skulhedface, formerly a beautiful queen of a peaceful, vegetarian planet, was transformed into a foul creature during a raid on her planet by Cardinal Syn, Gwar's eternal foe. She travels to Earth, where she is instructed to acquire sufficient amounts of Jizmoglobin, a blue bodily fluid that is responsible for the creativity, rebellion and decadence of all creatures.\n\nGwar, meanwhile, is hosting a telethon on their pirate television network, Slave Pit TV. The goal of the telethon: offer enough human sacrifices to unite with the World Maggot, which lies dormant in the Earth's core, and ride it off the planet. They are having an increasing amount of success, which draws the attention of GlomCo, an archetypical evil media conglomerate.\n\nBoss Glom, the CEO, summons Gwar's manager, Sleazy P. Martini, in the hopes that he will sell Gwar out, reduce them to commodities, and ultimately kill the band to prevent any interference. Martini repeatedly refuses, until he is offered more money than he has ever seen in his life. At this point, Gwar breaks through the ceiling, and Boss Glom summons his armed guards. Gwar makes short work of the guards and the other board members, but Glom escapes to his private elevator. After that, Slave Pit TV is then broadcast to the public, having taken over the equipment as well as the corporation.\n\nOn the way down to a secret laboratory, Boss Glom is revealed to be Skulhedface, and in her laboratory, her assistant, Flopsy, assists her to a large Jizmoglobin extraction device. Rocker Sebastian Bach is placed in the device, his Jizmoglobin removed, and emerges a business type with absolutely no personality. Skulhedface starts to drink the Jizmoglobin, when a transmission from Cardinal Syn comes in - he will \"be arriving in the next movie\" (which he does) to collect Jizmoglobin and subjugate the planet (which he attempts to do, but fails).\n\nMeanwhile, the telethon is still going well, and Gwar feasts their imminent departure from the planet. Beefcake the Mighty, however, spots Flopsy, who has come to lure him into a trap. Skulhedface removes his face, dons it herself, and tells Gwar of midgets in the basement (with which they could sate their sexual appetite one last time before leaving).\n\nWhen they get to the basement, they find Beefcake, tied up and without a face. During a conversation with Skulhedface, Flopsy returns Beefcake's face, and in return, decides to stick his fist in Flopsy's mouth (which is vaginal in shape). Unfortunately, he is too rough, and Flopsy dies.\n\nSkulhedface reveals her greatest weapon - the Flesh Column, composed of the foulest of human pieces. The combined efforts of Gwar are insufficient, and they are subjected to the device, which is overloaded with their combined Jizmoglobin. Skulhedface is reverted to her old self, and Gwar into infants. Now benevolent, she returns their Jizmoglobin, and things return to as they were. The entire band (minus Slymenstra Hymen) rapes her to death, and they promptly return to the World Maggot. As they reach the surface, they see the World Maggot flying away, while Sleazy P. Martini \"consoles\" them and concludes the broadcast day.\n\n\"This Toilet Earth\" had three music videos: \"Saddam a Go-Go\", \"The Insidious Soliloquy of Skulhedface\" and \"Jack the World.\" Two of these videos, \"The Insidious Soliloquy of Skulhedface\" and \"Jack the World\", were filmed during the making of this movie (the former actually being a portion of the movie itself). \"Saddam a Go-Go\" used footage (and new bassist Casey Orr) from the tour corresponding with the album and film, and was not in the final release.\n\n"}

Earlier it was a Mohkuma (মহকুমা) under the Mymensingh district. Greater Mymensingh, the largest district on the Indian subcontinent, was separate from their 6 upazila Kishorgonj (Mohkuma), Tangail, Sherpur, Jamalpur, Netrokona (Presently all upazilla upgraded as District status). The district consists of 8 municipalities, 13 upazilas, 105 union parishads, 39 wards, 145 mahallas, 946 mouzas and 1775 villages.\n\n\nThe district of Kishoreganj contains 3,980 mosques, 530 temples and seven churches.\n\nKishorganj is a place of the creed of respectively Sanatana and Loukik Islam. Both Meghna and Brahmaputra river have contributed to its existence. Many traditional rituals are observed every year in Kishoreganj. Among them Kurikhai Mela is one of the most celebrated fair. It is a shrine-oriented festival. It is held every year on the last Monday of the month of Magh. The shrine is situated in Katiadi thana. The notable Shamsuddin Aulia, one of the fellow of Hajrat Shahjalal, died in this particular place.\n\nJangalbari Fort is situated in Jangalbari village of Karimganj Upazila. It was once a strong outpost of the Bengal Ruler Isa Khan. Isa Khan erected several structures inside the fort area. This fort was severely damaged by the great earthquake in 1897. Isa Khan's descendants still live in this village. Currently the fourteenth descendant of Isa Khan, Dewan Amin Dau Khan, lives in the fort.\n\nEgarosindur () is a village in Kishoreganj. The village is situated on the east side of the river Brahmaputra. The name of this village is found in the \"Akbornama\" by the historian Abul Fazal. There is a debate among historians about the history of Egarosindur. Some engraved silver coins, iron-axes, lances and bows and arrows were discovered there presumed to be from the 10th century BC. Historians also believe that Egarosindur was inhabited since 1000 BC, i.e. the time of the Murza. There lived many tribals named Koch and Hajong. Egarosindur was a centre of trade and commerce.\nIn 380 AD Egarosindur was under the reign of Dobak state. After that this region was reigned by the King of Kamarupa. Another historical analyses prove that in the 8th century Egarosindur was an important river port where Muslim traders exported and imported their product with Rome and Paris. In the 10th century Egarosindur was under the control of Azhaba, a king of Hazradi. Azbaha triumph over this land by defeated King Botong. But after some years Azbaha was beaten by Bebuid Raza and Bebuid Raza was the first popular king of this land. In his time, Egarosindur was reborn again. He built spectacular palaces, forts, big canals, temples etc.\n\nIn the second part of the 10th century King Srishochandra controlled this land. After that this area might be governed by Shen king and then it is included with the land of Kamarupa. In the beginning of 14th century the king of Goura, Firoz Shah succeed to win Egarosindur. In 1338 Sultan Fakruddin Mubarak Shah take the authorization of this ancient land. It was seemed that when Sultan was in a critical position, he took shelter in Egarosindur. In 1577 Isa Khan declared Egarosindur a sovereign state. In his age this place appeared as a remarkable place of trade and commerce. In the fort of Egarosindur there held a massive battle between Isa Khan and Mansingh, the general of Akbar. But in the battlefield Mansingh was greatly impressed by the boldness and hospitality of Isa Khan. In one stage when they carried out a duel, Mansingh's sword broke down. Isa Khan did not take his life and most surprisingly he offered his own sword to Mansingh. He said, \"I could not kill any helpless person\". And then they made an agreement in the battlefield. Akbar granted Isa Khan a jaigir lease over 22 pargonas. After Isa Khan, Egarosindur as a distinct entity was again lost to history. In the reign of Shahjahan in 1638, the king of Assam attacked Egarosindur. Though he was not competent to defeat the warrior of Shahjahan, he destroyed this land ruthlessly when he fled from the battlefield.\n\nIt is an attractive building at Egarosindur may be dated sometime around 1680AD. The mosque stands at the back of a slightly raised platform, which is enclosed by a low wall with a gateway consists of an oblong structure with do-chala roof.\nThe mosque proper is a square structure, 5.79m a side in the inside, and is emphasized with octagonal towers on the four exteriors angles. All these towers shooting high above the roof and terminating in solid kiosks with cupolas, were originally crowned with kalasa finials, still intact in the southern one. The western wall accommodates inside three mihrab –the central one semi –octagonal and the side ones rectangular. The central doorway and central mihrab are larger than their flanking counterparts. The mosque has four axially projected frontones, each corresponding to the centrally located doorways and the central mihrab. The parapets and cornices are horizontal in the usual Mughal fashion.\n\nAll the mihrabs are enriched with terracotta decoration. The mihrabs are arched having cuspings in their outer faces. The pilasters, supporting the mihrab arches, show a series of decorated bands topped by a frieze of petals. The spandrels of these arches, though now plain must have been originally enriched with terracotta plaques. Above the rectangular frame of the central mihrab there is a row of arched-niches filled with varieties of small trees containing flowers.\nThe mosque should specially be noted for its four axially projected frontons with bordering ornamental turrets, a device which must have been borrowed from the four axial iwan-type gateways of the Persian influenced north Indian Mughal standard mosques of Fathpur,Agra and Delhi.\n\nAnother structure of Egarosindur, is one of the best-conserved monuments in the country. A pertain inscription tablet, fixed over the central mihrab, record that the mosque was built in 1062 AH (1652 AD) by one Sadi, son of Shaikh Shiroo, during the reign of Shahjahan.\n\nMeasuring 25 ft a side, the single-domed square mosque was built on a raised piece of land. There are three arched entrances in the east, and one each in the middle of the north and the south sides. The central archway, which is larger, is set within a slightly projected rectangular frame, but the flanking archways are contained within slightly recessed rectangle.The qibla wall is recessed with three semi-octagonal mihrabs, which correspond to the three eastern doorways. The mosque represents a happy blending of Mughal elements with the Sultanate architectural traits characteristic of Bengal.\n\nThe remain fort is still visible in a spot near the site of Sadi mosque. In this fort Isa Khan was fought against Manshingh, the general of Akbar. Recently some valuable antiques are also found in this place, which bear the attractive history of this legendary place.\n\nIn Egarosindur, many pious and kind religious leaders came here for inviting people into the light of Islam. Some of them named- Hazrat Samsuddin Bokhari (RH), Fakir Garibullah Shah (RH), Syed Ahmed Rumi (RH), Nigrin shah(RH) and so on. Their \"mazars\" are situated in this village. The \"Mazar\" of Garibullah shah(RH) is in a hill like higher position. People treat their \"Mazar\" with great respect.

The film stars Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Robin Wright and Anjelica Huston. It tells the story of Freddy Gale, a man who has been tormented for more than five years by his daughter's death in a car accident. When he finds out that the man who was responsible for the death is being released from prison, he decides to seek vengeance.\nThe film was released on November 16, 1995 and received generally positive reviews from critics. Despite the positive critical reception, the film was a commercial failure, grossing only $869,000 worldwide, against a budget of $9 million.\n\nFreddy Gale (Nicholson) has been tormented for the five years following the death of his daughter Emily. Once a devoted husband and father, he is now an alcoholic who spends his nights hanging out in strip clubs and sleeping with prostitutes. Now the drunk driver who killed her, John Booth (Morse), is released from prison. Freddy immediately reveals to his ex-wife Mary (Huston) that he is going to kill Booth. She begs him not to, and they get into an altercation that ends with her new husband throwing him out of the house.\n\nJohn Booth is now living in a trailer outside of his parents' house and merely plans to go on with his life, even as he is haunted by remorse for killing Emily. At night Freddy arrives at the Booth residence, armed with a pistol. He clumsily breaks into the trailer trying to shoot, but he forgot to load a magazine. John calmly tells him he won't call the police and will let Freddy kill him, but asks for some time to savor his freedom. Freddy accepts, and gives John three days to live.\n\nJohn tries to live his life as best as he can before the third day arrives. He meets an artist named JoJo (Wright) at a friend's party and he has a brief romance with her before she realizes that he can't let go of the mistake he made. He reveals to her that when he hit Emily, he came to her side as she was dying and she apologized to him for \"not having looked both ways.\" John goes to Emily's grave and leaves flowers, but leaves when he sees Mary there.\n\nOn the third day, Freddy calls Mary and breaks down in tears as he tells her of a terrible nightmare he had. In the nightmare, he is driving by his daughter's school and stops at a crosswalk where children (including a living Emily) wait. He sees that John Booth is the crossing guard. Freddy then sees himself run over all of the children, even Emily. They meet at a diner, and Mary tells him that he is beyond her help; Freddy becomes enraged and curses her. After Mary leaves, Freddy gets drunk and starts to drive to John's house. John waits in his trailer. Freddy is pulled over by the police en route to the house and arrested for drunk driving. Before the police can take him in, however, Freddy grabs his pistol and runs away. He breaks into a home and hides in a little girl's room. The girl guides the police away, and Freddy thanks her and leaves.\n\nFreddy arrives at John's trailer and waits before he enters. John abruptly jumps from a corner with a rifle in hand. Freddy tells him since he is on the run, on his property, and armed, John should be able to get away with killing him. There is a standoff as they point guns at each other. John however drops his rifle and runs away; Freddy follows him. After a lengthy chase across the city, Freddy catches John climbing a fence and fires at him. John is only superficially wounded, however, and continues running. Freddy follows him, until he realizes that John has led him to the graveyard where Emily is buried. John talks silently to the grave and finally says \"Your daddy's coming\". Freddy hands John his pistol and cries over the grave, apologizing to his daughter. John takes Freddy's hand as the sun rises.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes reporting a score of 75% based on 28 reviews.\n\nAnjelica Huston's performance in the film was praised and she received nominations for Best Supporting Actress from the Hollywood Foreign Press and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). She lost out on the Golden Globe to Mira Sorvino for \"Mighty Aphrodite\" and the SAG award to Kate Winslet for \"Sense and Sensibility\".\n\n"}

W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the fourth Prime Minister of Ceylon (later Sri Lanka), who served from 1956 until his assassination by Somarama in 1959.\n\nSomarama Thero was born on August 27, 1915, to Iso Hamy and Ratugama Rallage Dieris Appuhamy. He was robed when he was 14 on January 20, 1929, and received his schooling at Talduwa Ihala School. He allegedly received his higher ordination as a Thero (Buddhist priest) in Kandy on June 25, 1936.\n\nAllegedly drafted into the conspiracy by Mapitigama Buddharakkitha Thero, the chief incumbent of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara, Somarama Thero reluctantly consented to assassinate the Prime Minister, \"for the greater good of his country, race and religion\". Buddharakkitha Thero attributed Bandaranaike's failure to aggressively pursue the Nationalist reforms as the motive to eliminate him. \n\nThe date was set to September 25, 1959, when Somarama Thero was to visit the Prime Minister at his home and shoot him at point blank range. His saffron robes gave him free access to 'Tintagel', the private residence of Bandaranaike, in Rosmead Place, Colombo. As the Premier commenced his routine meetings with the public, Somarama waited in patience for his turn. When the monk's presence was announced to him, Bandaranaike rose to greet him in the traditional Buddhist manner. The assassin then pulled out the revolver hidden in his robes and fired at the prostrate Prime Minister. Somarama was injured in firing between himself and the Prime Minister's bodyguards.\n\nSomarama Thero then faced trial, along with four other involved in the conspiracy. It was a hopeless case, and in spite of a resourceful defense the jury unanimously found Somarama Thero guilty of the capital offense. Before sentencing him to death, the trial judge, Justice T.S. Fernando, QC, CBE, told Somarama Thero he had a \"streak of conscience as he did not attend court in his saffron robes.\" The chief conspirator, Mapitigama Buddharakkitha Thero and H. P. Jayawardena, a businessman closely associated with him, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder. Bandaranaike had suspended capital punishment, but after his death the government had it restored.

{"id": "2274597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274597", "title": "Auxiliary Territorial Service", "text": "Auxiliary Territorial Service\n\nThe Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS; often pronounced as an acronym) was the women's branch of the British Army during the Second World War. It was formed on 9 September 1938, initially as a women's voluntary service, and existed until 1 February 1949, when it was merged into the Women's Royal Army Corps.\n\nThe ATS had its roots in the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC), which was formed in 1917 as a voluntary service. During the First World War its members served in a number of jobs including clerks, cooks, telephonists and waitresses. The WAAC was disbanded after four years in 1921.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, the government decided to establish a new Corps for women, and an advisory council, which included members of the Territorial Army (TA), a section of the Women's Transport Service (FANY) and the Women's Legion, was set up. The council decided that the ATS would be attached to the Territorial Army, and the women serving would receive two thirds the pay of male soldiers.\nAll women in the army joined the ATS except for nurses, who joined Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS), and medical and dental officers, who were commissioned directly into the Army and held army ranks, and those remaining in the FANY, known as Free FANYs.\n\nThe first recruits to the ATS were employed as cooks, clerks and storekeepers. At the outbreak of the Second World War, 300 ATS members were billeted to France. As the German Army advanced through France, the British Expeditionary Force was driven back towards the English Channel. This led to the evacuation of troops from Dunkirk in May 1940, and some ATS telephonists were among the last British personnel to leave the country.\n\nAs more men joined the war effort, it was decided to increase the size of the ATS, with numbers reaching 65,000 by September 1941. Women between the ages of 17 and 43 were allowed to join, although these rules were relaxed in order to allow WAAC veterans to join up to the age of 50. The duties of members were also expanded, seeing ATS orderlies, drivers, postal workers and ammunition inspectors.\n\nOver the six-year period of the War, about 500 ATS personnel were trained to operate the Cinetheodolite, with the highest number being in 1943–44, when 305 ATS were in active service using this equipment. One application of this specialist camera was in gunnery practice, where a pair of Cinetheodolites a known distance apart filmed the shell bursts from anti-aircraft artillery against target drones towed by an aircraft. By comparing the filmed location of the shells' detonation and the target, accurate calculations of their relative position could be made that would reveal any systematic error in the gunsights.\n\nIn December 1941, Parliament passed the National Service Act, which called up unmarried women between 20 and 30 years old to join one of the auxiliary services. These were the ATS, the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and the Women's Transport Service. Married women were also later called up, although pregnant women and those with young children were exempt. Other options under the Act included joining the Women's Voluntary Service (WVS), which supplemented the emergency services at home, or the Women's Land Army, helping on farms.\n\nThere was also provision made in the act for objection to service on moral grounds, as about a third of those on the conscientious objectors list were women. A number of women were prosecuted as a result of the act, some even being imprisoned. Despite this, by 1943 about 9 out of 10 women were taking an active part in the war effort.\n\nWomen were barred from serving in battle, but due to shortages of men, ATS members, as well as members of the other women's voluntary services, took over many support tasks, such as radar operators, forming part of the crews of anti-aircraft guns and military police. However, these roles were not without risk, and there were, according to the Imperial War Museum, 717 casualties during World War II.\nThe first 'Mixed' Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) battery of the Royal Artillery (435 (Mixed) HAA Battery) was formed on 25 June 1941, and took over an operational gun site in Richmond Park, south-west London, in August. It was the forerunner of hundreds of similar units with the ATS supplying two-thirds of the personnel: at its height in 1943 three-quarters of Anti-Aircraft Command's HAA batteries were mixed. Several Heavy Anti-Aircraft regiments deployed to North West Europe with 21st Army Group in 1944–45 were 'Mixed' regiments.\n\nA secret trial (the 'Newark Experiment' in April 1941) having shown that women were capable of operating heavy searchlight equipment and coping with conditions on the often desolate searchlight sites, members of the ATS began training at Rhyl to replace male personnel in searchlight regiments. At first they were employed in searchlight Troop headquarters, but in July 1942 the 26th (London Electrical Engineers) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery became the first 'Mixed' regiment, with seven Troops of ATS women posted to it, forming the whole of 301 Battery and half of 339 Battery. In October that year the all-women 301 Battery was transferred to the new 93rd (Mixed) Searchlight Regiment, the last searchlight regiment formed during World War II, which by August 1943 comprised about 1500 women out of an establishment of 1674. Many other searchlight and anti-aircraft regiments on Home Defence followed, freeing men aged under 30 of medical category A1 for transfer to the infantry.\n\nSimilarly, by 1943 the ATS represented 10 per cent of the Royal Corps of Signals, having taken over the major part of the signal office and operating duties in the War Office and Home Commands, and ATS companies were sent to work on the lines of communications of active overseas theatres.\nBy VE Day and before demobilization, there were over 190,000 members of the women's Auxiliary Territorial Service.\n\nFamous members of the ATS included Mary Churchill, youngest daughter of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Princess (later Queen) Elizabeth, eldest daughter of the King, who trained as a lorry driver and mechanic.\n\nAfter the cessation of hostilities women continued to serve in the ATS, as well as in the WRNS and WAAF. It was succeeded by the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC), which formed on 1 February 1949 under Army Order 6.\n\nInitially ranks were completely different from those of the army, but used the same rank insignia, although the crown was replaced by a laurel wreath. Members were required to salute their own superior officers, but not other organisations' officers, although it was considered courteous to do so.\n\nOn 9 May 1941, the ATS rank structure was reorganised, and as of July 1941 the ATS was given full military status and members were no longer volunteers. The other ranks now held almost identical ranks to army personnel, but officers continued to have a separate rank system, that was somewhat modified. All uniforms and badges of rank remained the same, although crowns replaced laurel wreaths in the rank insignia. Members were now required to salute all superior officers.\n\nThe only holders of the rank of chief controller were the first three directors, promoted to the rank on their appointment, and Princess Mary, who held it from 1939 and was appointed the ATS's honorary controller-commandant in August 1941.\n\nWhen other ranks were assigned to mixed-sex Royal Artillery batteries of Anti-Aircraft Command starting in 1941, they were accorded the Royal Artillery ranks of gunner, lance-bombardier, and bombardier (instead of private, lance-corporal, and corporal), and wore the RA's braided white lanyard on the right shoulder and the 'grenade' collar badge above the left breast pocket of their uniform tunic.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2274616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274616", "title": "Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children", "text": "Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\n\nThe Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), developed by David Wechsler, is an individually administered intelligence test for children between the ages of 6 and 16. The Fifth Edition (WISC-V; Wechsler, 2014) is the most recent version.\n\nThe WISC-V takes 45–65 minutes to administer. It generates a Full Scale IQ (formerly known as an intelligence quotient or IQ score) that represents a child's general intellectual ability. It also provides five primary index scores: Verbal Comprehension Index, Visual Spatial Index, Fluid Reasoning Index, Working Memory Index, and Processing Speed Index. These indices represent a child's abilities in discrete cognitive domains. Five ancillary composite scores can be derived from various combinations of primary or primary and secondary subtests.\n\nFive complementary subtests yield three complementary composite scores to measure related cognitive abilities relevant to assessment and identification of specific learning disabilities, particularly dyslexia and dyscalculia. Variation in testing procedures and goals can reduce time of assessment to 15–20 minutes for the assessment of a single primary index, or increase testing time to three or more hours for a complete assessment, including all primary, ancillary, and complementary indices.\n\nThe original WISC (Wechsler, 1949) was an adaption of several of the subtests that made up the Wechsler–Bellevue Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1939) but also featured several subtests designed specifically for it. The subtests were organized into Verbal and Performance scales and provided scores for Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ).\n\nEach successive edition has re-normed the test to compensate for the Flynn effect, ensuring not only that the norms do not become outdated which is suggested to result in inflated scores on intelligence measures, but that they are representative of the current population (Flynn, 1984, 1987, 1999; Matarazzo, 1972). Additional updates and refinements include changes to the questions to make them less biased against minorities and females and updated materials to make them more useful in the administration of the test. A revised edition was published in 1974 as the WISC-R (Wechsler, 1974), featuring the same subtests. However, the age range was changed from 5–15 to 6–16.\n\nThe third edition was published in 1991 (WISC-III; Wechsler, 1991) and brought with it a new subtest as a measure of processing speed. In addition to the traditional VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ scores, four new index scores were introduced to represent more narrow domains of cognitive function: the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), the Perceptual Organization Index (POI), the Freedom from Distractibility Index (FDI), and the Processing Speed Index (PSI).\n\nThe WISC-IV was produced in 2003. The WISC-V was published in 2014. The WISC-V has a total of 21 subtests. It yields 15 composite scores.\n\nThe WISC is one test in a suite of Wechsler intelligence scales. Subjects 16 and over are tested with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), and children ages two years and six months to seven years and seven months are tested with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). There is some overlap between tests: children aged 6 years 0 months through 7 years 7 months can complete the WPPSI or the WISC; children aged 16 can complete the WISC-V or the WAIS-IV. Different floor effect and ceiling effect can be achieved using the different tests, allowing for a greater understanding of the child's abilities or deficits. This means that a 16-year-old adolescent who has an intellectual disability may be tested using the WISC-V so that the clinician may see the floor of their knowledge (the lowest level).\n\nThere are five primary index scores, the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Visual Spatial Index (VSI), Fluid Reasoning Index (FRI), Working Memory Index (WMI), and Processing Speed Index (PSI). Two subtests must be administered to obtain each of the primary index scores; thus, a total of 10 subtests are primary subtests. The Full Scale IQ is derived from 7 of the 10 primary subtests: Both Verbal Comprehension subtests, one Visual Spatial subtest, two Fluid Reasoning subtests, one Working Memory subtest, and one Processing Speed subtest. Verbal Comprehension and Fluid Reasoning are weighted more heavily in the Full Scale IQ to reflect the importance of crystallized and fluid abilities in modern intelligence models (Wechsler, 2014).\n\nThe VCI is derived from the Similarities and Vocabulary subtests. The Verbal Comprehension scale subtests are described below:\n\n\nThe VCI is an overall measure of verbal concept formation (the child's ability to verbally reason) and is influenced by semantic knowledge.\n\nThe VSI is derived from the Block Design and Visual Puzzles subtests. These subtests are as follows:\n\nThe VSI is a measure of visual spatial processing.\n\nThe FRI is derived from the Matrix Reasoning and Figure Weights subtests. The Fluid Reasoning scale subtests are described below:\n\nThe FRI is a measure of inductive and quantitative reasoning.\n\nThe WMI is derived from the Digit Span and Picture Span subtests. The Working Memory scale's subtests are as follows:\n\nThe WMI is a measure of working memory ability.\n\nThe PSI is derived from the Coding and Symbol Search subtests. The Processing Speed subtests are as follows:\n\nThe PSI is a measure of processing speed.\n\nThe 2014 publication of the WISC-V contained five ancillary index scores that may be derived for special clinical purposes or situations: the Quantitative Reasoning Index (QRI), the Auditory Working Memory Index (AWMI), the Nonverbal Index (NVI), the General Ability Index (GAI), and the Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI). Three of these ancillary index scores (NVI, GAI, and CPI) can be derived from the 10 primary subtests. The QRI and the AWMI can each be derived by administering one additional subtest from subtests that are within one of the five primary scales (Verbal Comprehension scale, Visual Spatial Index, Fluid Reasoning scale, Working Memory scale, and Processing Speed scale) but are not primary. The set of these subtests is termed secondary subtests (Wechsler, 2014).\n\nTwo ancillary index scores termed the expanded index scores were released the year after the 2014 publication, so are not included in the published manuals. These are the Verbal (Expanded Crystallized) Index (VECI) and the Expanded Fluid Index (EFI) (Raiford, Drozdick, Zhang, & Zhou, 2015).\n\nThree complementary index scores are available to measure cognitive processes that are important to achievement and are sensitive to specific learning disabilities. The complementary index scores are the Naming Speed Index (NSI), designed to measure rapid automatized naming, and the Symbol Translation Index, designed to measure visual-verbal associative memory, which is sometimes termed visual-verbal paired associate learning in the published literature (Wechsler, 2014). The Naming Speed scale contains Naming Speed Literacy, which measures rapid automatic naming, and Naming Speed Literacy, which is the only commercially published and normed measure of rapid quantity naming, also known as subitizing. Naming Speed Quantity is uniquely sensitive to math achievement and specific learning disabilities in mathematics (Raiford et al., 2016; Wechsler, Raiford, & Holdnack, 2014).\n\nThe WISC–V normative sample consisted of 2,200 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years 11 months. In addition to the normative sample, a number of special group samples were collected, including the following: children identified as intellectually gifted, children with mild or moderate intellectual disability, children with specific learning disorders (reading, written expression, and math), children with ADHD, children with disruptive behavior, children who are English Language Learners, children with autism spectrum disorder with language impairment, children with autism spectrum disorder without language impairment, and children with traumatic brain injuries.\n\nThe WISC–V is also linked with measures of achievement, adaptive behavior, executive function, and behavior and emotion. Equivalency studies were also conducted within the Wechsler family of tests and with a Kaufman test (the KABC-II) enabling comparisons between various intellectual ability scores over the lifespan. A number of concurrent studies were conducted to examine the scale's reliability and validity. Evidence of the convergent and discriminant validity of the WISC–V is provided by correlational studies with the following instruments: WISC–IV, WPPSI–IV, WAIS–IV, WASI–II, KABC–II, KTEA–3, WIAT–III, NEPSY–II, Vineland–II, and BASC–II. Evidence of construct validity was provided through a series of factor-analytic studies and mean comparisons using matched samples of special group and nonclinical children.\n\nThe WISC is used not only as an intelligence test, but as a clinical tool. Some practitioners use the WISC as part of an assessment to diagnose attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disabilities, for example. This is usually done through a process called \"pattern analysis\", in which the various subtests' scores are compared to one another (ipsative scoring) and clusters of unusually low scores in relation to the others are searched for. David Wechsler himself suggested this in 1958.\n\nHowever, the research does not show this to be an effective way to diagnose ADHD or learning disabilities. The vast majority of children with ADHD do not display certain subtests substantially below others, and many children who display such patterns do not have ADHD. Other patterns for children with learning disabilities show a similar lack of usefulness of the WISC as a diagnostic tool. Although, when Cattell Horn Carrol (CHC) theory is used to interpret the WISC–V subtests, things tend to make a great deal more sense.\n\nWhen diagnosing children, best practice suggests that a multi-test battery (i.e., multi-factored evaluation) should be used as learning problems, attention, and emotional difficulties can have similar symptoms, co-occur, or reciprocally influence each other. For example, children with learning difficulties can become emotionally distraught and thus have concentration difficulties, begin to exhibit behavior problems, or both. Children with ADD or ADHD may show learning difficulties because of their attentional problems or also have learning disorder or disability (or have nothing else). In short, while diagnosis of any childhood or adult difficulty should never be made based on IQ alone (or interview, physician examination, parent report, other test etc. for that matter) the cognitive ability test can help rule out, in conjunction with other tests and sources of information, other explanations for problems, uncover co-morbid problems, and be a rich source of information when properly analyzed and care is taken to avoid relying simply on the single summary IQ score (Sattler, Dumont, & Coalson, 2016).\n\nThe WISC can be used to show discrepancies between a child's intelligence and his/her performance at school (and it is this discrepancy that school psychologists look for when using this test). In a clinical setting, learning disabilities can be diagnosed through a comparison of intelligence scores and scores on an achievement test, such as the Woodcock Johnson III or Wechsler Individual Achievement Test II. If a child's achievement is below what would be expected given their level of intellectual functioning (as derived from an IQ test such as the WISC-IV), then a learning disability may be present. Other psychologists and researchers believe that the WISC can be used to understand the complexities of the human mind by examining each subtest and can, indeed, help in diagnosing learning disabilities.\n\nSubsequently, the WISC can be used as part of an assessment battery to identify intellectual giftedness, learning difficulties, and cognitive strengths and weaknesses. When combined with other measures such as the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System–II (ABAS–II; Harrison & Oakland, 2003) and the Children's Memory Scale (CMS; Cohen, 1997) its clinical utility can be enhanced. Combinations such as these provide information on cognitive and adaptive functioning, both of which are required for the proper diagnosis of learning difficulties and learning and memory functioning resulting in a richer picture of a child's cognitive functioning.\n\nThe WISC–V is linked with the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement–Third Edition (KTEA–3; Kaufman & Kaufman, 2014) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-III (WIAT–III; Pearson, 2009), a measure of academic achievement. This linkage provides information on both cognitive ability and academic achievement in children. Tests of intellectual functioning are used extensively in school settings to evaluate specific cognitive deficits that may contribute to low academic achievement, and to predict future academic achievement. Using the WISC–V in such a manner provides information for educational intervention purposes, such as interventions that address learning difficulties and cognitive deficits.\n\nThe WISC–V can also be used to assess a child's cognitive development, with respect to the child's chronological age. Using such comparisons with other sources of data, the WISC can contribute information concerning a child's developmental and psychological well-being. Very high or very low scores may suggest contributing factors for adjustment difficulties in social contexts that present problems in accepting such developmental diversity (or that cannot accommodate more than a certain level of high cognitive functioning). \n\nWISC has been translated or adapted to many languages, and norms have been established for a number of countries, including Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), Arabic, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Czech, Croatian, French (France and Canada), German (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), English (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia), Welsh, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese (Hong Kong), Korean (South Korea), Greek, Romanian, Indonesian, Slovenian and Italian. Separate norms are established with each translation. (Norway uses the Swedish norms). India uses the Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC), an adaptation of WISC by Arthur J. Malin. However, the norms of MISIC are outdated (have not been updated since 50 years) and many Clinical Psychologists do not use this test in their practice due to possible errors in measured IQs because of Flynn effect. Being from a developing nation, Indian children have undergone numerous changes in their intellectual abilities in last 5 decades, which makes the application of MISIC redundant, though some psychometricians suggest that such changes are minor, hence the test is still applicable. Instead of MISIC, the fourth edition of WISC that was adapted and standardized for India in 2012, is more commonly accepted and used by clinicians. Being the most widely used test for intelligence assessment in India, MISIC still has its supporters, and will continue to be used by clinicians all over the country, owing to which its norms must be updated. The Japanese version of the WISC-IV was developed by Japanese psychologists Kazuhiko Ueno, Kazuhiro Fujita, Hisao Maekawa, Toshinori Ishikuma, Hitoshi Dairoku, and Osamu Matsuda.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2274628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274628", "title": "Optacon", "text": "Optacon\n\nThe Optacon (OPtical to TActile CONverter) is an electromechanical device that enables blind people to read printed material that has not been transcribed into Braille. The device consists of two parts: a scanner which the user runs over the material to be read, and a finger pad which translates the words into vibrations felt on the finger tips. The Optacon was conceived by John Linvill, a professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, and developed with researchers at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). Telesensory Systems manufactured the device from 1971 until it was discontinued in 1996. Although effective once mastered, it was expensive and took many hours of training to reach competency. In 2005, TSI suddenly shut down. Employees were \"walked out\" of the building and lost accrued vacation time, medical insurance, and all benefits. Customers could not buy new machines or get existing machines fixed. Some work was done by other companies but no device with the versatility of the Optacon had been developed as of 2007. Many blind people continue to use their Optacons to this day. The Optacon offers capabilities that no other device offers including the ability to see a printed page or computer screen as it truly appears including drawings, typefaces, and specialized text layouts.\n\nThe Optacon consists of a main electronics unit about the size of a portable tape recorder connected by a thin cable to a camera module about the size of a penknife (See Fig. 1).\n\nThe main electronics unit contains a \"tactile array\" onto which the blind person places their index finger. The Optacon user moves the camera module across a line of print, and an image of an area about the size of a letterspace is transmitted via the connecting cable to the main electronics unit. The tactile array in the main electronics unit contains a 24-by-6 matrix of tiny metal rods, each of which can be independently vibrated by a piezoelectric reed connected to it. Rods are vibrated that correspond to black parts of the image, thus forming a tactile image of the letter being viewed by the camera module. As the user moves the lens module along the print line, tactile images of print letters are felt moving across the array of rods under the user's finger. The Optacon includes a knob to adjust the intensity at which the tactile array rods vibrate, a knob to set the image threshold between white and black needed to turn on the vibration of the rods in the tactile array, and a switch that determines whether images will be interpreted as dark print on a light background or as light print on a dark background.\n\nLyle Thume, an Optacon user and director of blind rehabilitation services at the Rehabilitation Institute in Detroit summed up the Optacon this way in 1973: \"It opens up a whole new world to blind people. They aren't restricted anymore to reading material set in braille.\"\n\nThe Optacon was developed by John Linvill, a professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, who later became head of the Electrical Engineering Department. The Optacon was developed with researchers at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). Linvill was one of Telesensory's founders and Chairman of the Telesensory Board. The initial stimulus for development of the Optacon was Linvill's daughter, Candy (born 1952, blind since the age of 3). Using the Optacon, Candy graduated from Stanford and received a PhD. She has worked as a clinical psychologist since, so, like her father, she is often referred to in the press as \"Dr. Linvill\".\n\nIn 1962, during a sabbatical year in Switzerland, Linvill visited an IBM laboratory in Germany, where he observed a high speed printer that used a set of small pins—like hammers—to print letters onto strips of paper. He thought, \"If you could feel the hammers with your fingertip, you could surely recognize the image.\" So on our return to Zurich, I told my wife and son and daughter, Candy, who was blind: \"Guys, I've got the most magnificent idea. We'll make something that will let Candy read ordinary printed material.\" And although his family laughed at this notion, \"oh, that'll never work!\" the idea for the Optacon was born.\n\nUpon returning to Stanford, Linvill, together with graduate students G.J. Alonzo and John Hill, developed the concept further with the support of the Office of Naval Research. A key aspect of Linvill's concept was to use vibrating piezoelectric reeds, called bimorphs, to move the pins in a two-dimensional array to produce tactile images. The idea of using vibrating bimorphs was critical for several reasons:\n\nIn 1964 Linvill applied for a patent, and U.S. Patent 3,229,387 was granted in January 1966.\n\nAmazingly, in 1913 a reading machine for the blind, called the optophone, was built by Edmund Edward Fournier d’Albe in England. It used selenium photosensors to detect black print and convert it into an audible output which could be interpreted by a blind person. A small number were built with reading being exceedingly slow for most people. The concept of a tactile optical scanning device can be traced back to 1915, as mentioned (and dismissed) in Fournier d'Albe's 1924 book, The Moon-Element . Described as a device using iron pins stimulated by electro-magnets to convey dark and light in a tactile manner, questions hung over the feasibility of such a device, and indeed, if it existed at all at that time.\n\nOf note, in In 1943, Vannevar Bush and Caryl Haskins of the wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development directed resources toward the development of technologies to assist wounded veterans. The Battelle Institute was provided with funding to develop an improved Optophone and Haskins Laboratories was funded to conduct research toward a synthetic speech reading machine. This group turned “sour” on the Optophone approach after concluding that reading would be too slow.\n\nIn 1957 U.S. Veteran's Administration, Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service (PSAS), under Dr. Eugene Murphy, began funding the development of a reading machine for the blind. The principal investigator on this project was Hans Mauch, a German scientist brought to the U.S. after World War II. (During World War II Mauch worked for the German Air Ministry as part of the German V-1 missile development team.)\n\nMauch worked on reading machines having an “optophone-like” output, a “speech-like” sound output, and a synthetic speech output. The only one of these that was competitive to the Optacon development was the Stereotoner, basically an improved optophone. The Stereotoner design concept was that the user would move a vertical array of photosensors across a line of text. Each photosensor would send its signal to an audio oscillator set to a different frequency, with the top photosensor driving the highest frequency and the bottom photosensor driving the lowest frequency. The user would then hear tones and chords from which the letters could be identified.\n\nInitially Linvill was unaware that the Optacon was not the only reading machine for blind people under development. However, in 1961 James Bliss had returned to SRI from MIT where he had done a doctoral dissertation in a group working on the application of technology for the problems of blindness. Bliss was interested in basic research on the tactile sense, to better understand how it could be used to substitute for loss of vision. While at MIT, Bliss became aware of the existing research and development on reading machines for the blind, as well as the researchers and funding agencies. At SRI Bliss had obtained funding for his tactile research from the Department of Defense and NASA, who were interested in tactile displays for pilots and astronauts. This had enabled him to obtain a small computer and develop software to drive hundreds of tactile stimulators he had developed for research purposes. These tactile stimulators were small air jets, which were ideal for research because their arrangement and spacing could easily be changed and the contact to the skin was always assured. Bliss was studying how well subjects could recognize dynamic patterns presented on his array of air jet stimulators.\n\nAfter Linvill and Bliss decided to join forces to work on Linvill's vision of a reading machine, it became apparent that they needed to obtain funding for this objective, rather than the objectives of Department of Defense and NASA which had provided the funding up until that time. As a start, Bliss suggested that they visit Dr. Murphy at the VA, since he was the only then currently active government source of reading machine funding. However, Bliss knew that the research on “Optophone-like” reading machines had created negativity toward this “direct translation” approach because of the slow reading rates obtained. To counter this negativity, Bliss programmed an SRI computer to present text in a moving belt display, similar to that in Times Square New York City, on both his air jet stimulator array and on the Stanford bimorph array. Linvill's blind daughter, Candy, was then the subject who attempted to learn to read the text presented in this fashion. After several hours of training and practice, Candy was reading in excess of 30 words per minute. Bliss and Linvill felt this computer driven test was a valid simulation of the reading machine they proposed to develop. They felt the 30 words per minute reading rate achieved in a short time by Candy proved that if such a reading machine were developed, it would be useful. They didn’t know what the upper limit of reading speed would be, but had hopes that 100 words per minute could be achieved, since this was typical Braille reading rate.\n\nArmed with this result, Bliss and Linvill made an appointment to visit Dr. Murphy in Washington, D.C. Initially the meeting was going very well, with Dr. Murphy seeming to be very positive toward the possibility of funding the development. Murphy then mentioned that Linvill would have to assign his patent to the Veterans Administration. Linvill refused and the meeting abruptly ended.\n\nAs it turned out, this rejection was fortunate. The Office of Education was directed by a colleague of Linvill's from when he worked at Bell Laboratories. Development of a reading aid for the blind was very relevant to their mission since providing instructional material to blind mainstreamed students was an important problem. Linvill presented the Optacon idea to the Office of Education and it was enthusiastically received. This led to funding at a higher level (over $1.8 million of 1970 dollars over 4 years) than would have been likely from the Veterans Administration.\n\nThis higher level of funding was necessary to develop the custom integrated circuits that enabled the Optacon's small size, which was critical to its success. The Optacon project also assisted Stanford in establishing their Integrated Circuits facilities, leading MIT's Dean of Engineering to remark that Stanford got the lead in integrated circuit research because of the Optacon.\n\nWith funding established, Bliss joined the Stanford faculty half-time, the other half being at SRI. At SRI tactile reading experiments were conducted to maximize the reading rates achievable with the Optacon, as well as development of the bimorph tactile array and the optics for the camera. At Stanford custom integrated circuits were developed including the silicon retina and the drivers for the bimorphs, since they required a higher voltage than normal for solid state circuits at that time.\n\nThe first technical challenge toward developing the reading machine was how to build a \"tactile screen\" that could create a dynamic tactile image which was perceivable by the user and that had a refresh rate fast enough for useful reading rates. Linvill's initial work with graduate students Alonzo and Hill indicated that a piezoelectric bimorph could be suitable as the transducer to convert an electrical signal into a mechanical motion. The advantages of bimorphs were efficient transduction of electrical to mechanical energy (important for battery operation), small size, fast response, and relatively low cost.\n\nAlonzo determined that at vibration frequencies around 300 Hz, the amplitude needed for detection was much less than for frequencies around 60 Hz. Moreover, for reading rates of 100 words per minute, vibration rates of at least 200 Hz were needed. Linvill calculated the length, width, and thickness of a bimorph reed necessary for a resonance frequency of 200 Hz that could produce enough mechanical energy to stimulate a fingertip above the threshold of the sense of touch.\n\nBased on these calculations, an array of bimorphs was constructed for reading rate tests with the computer simulation at SRI. The computer simulation presented tactile images of perfectly formed and aligned letters in a stream that moved across the bimorph array. Candy Linvill and other blind subjects learned to read text presented in this fashion with encouraging results. However, this simulation differed from the conditions that the user would encounter with an Optacon in the real world. There would be a wide range of type fonts and print qualities, plus the user would have to move the camera across the text rather than the computer moving the text across the tactile screen at a fixed rate. It wasn’t known how much the mental load of controlling the camera would reduce the reading rate.\n\nIn considering the transition from the text being presented by the computer to the user moving a camera across a printed page, Bliss realized that there was a critical flaw in the design of the Veteran Administration Stereotoner. Since English alphabetic characters can be adequately displayed with 12 vertical pixels, the Stereotoner designer had assumed that only 12 photocells would be needed in the camera. However, this assumes perfect alignment between the camera and the printed text, which is never the case with a hand held camera. When the alignment is random, as with a hand held camera, a well known engineering theorem states that twice as many pixels are needed. Therefore, the Optacon was designed with 24 vertical pixels instead of 12. This theorem isn’t applicable in the horizontal dimension, so the columns in a two dimensional array can be twice as far apart as the rows.\n\nWhen a single column of 24 pixels is scanned across a line of text, all of the information is acquired. However, with the sense of touch, people are capable of perceiving two dimensional images. Bliss wondered if the reading rate would be higher if more than one column of 24 pixels were used, and if so, how many columns would be appropriate? Experiments with the computer simulation determined that reading rate increased dramatically up to 6 columns, which was a window width of about one letter space and this was about the maximum number of columns that could be placed on one finger. Jon Taenzer, one of Bliss’ Stanford graduate students, ran visual reading experiments on the same computer simulation and determined that for visual reading, reading rates continued to increase up to a window width of up to about 6 letter spaces. This led to a number of experiments toward trying to increase the tactile reading rate by increasing the number of columns in the tactile screen so more than one letter would be in view at a time. Instead of moving the text across only the index fingertip, tests were run with a screen wide enough for both the index finger and the middle finger to be used so two letters could be simultaneously tactually sensed. In another experiment the moving belt of text was run down the length of the fingers, rather than across them. The only approach that showed any promise of increasing the reading rate was when both index fingers were used, rather than the index finger and the adjacent middle finger. However, the use of both index fingers was incompatible with the design concept of using one hand to control the camera while the other hand sensed the tactile screen. The Optacon design was therefore based on an array of 24-by-6 pixels in both the camera retina and bimorph array.\n\nOther questions had to do with the spacing between the tactile pins in the bimorph array and their frequency of vibration. It was well known from experiments reported in the literature that people could distinguish two points from one with their index finger when they were a millimeter apart. However these previous experiments had not been done with vibrating pins. What effect would the vibration have and was there an optimum vibration frequency? These questions were answered by experiments conducted by Charles Rogers, a Stanford graduate student working with Bliss.\n\nWhile the neurophysiological data suggested that the smallest two point thresholds would be at vibration frequencies less than 60 Hertz, Roger's experiments showed that the two point thresholds around 200 Hertz were actually smaller. Bliss hosted a conference at SRI, including some leading neurophysiologists and psychophysicists, to try to resolve this discrepancy, but no one had an explanation. From a practical standpoint, Roger's result was very fortunate because the higher frequencies were required for refresh rates fast enough for reading up to 100 words per minute and for use of bimorphs small enough to construct a 24-by-6 array that fit on a fingertip.\n\nThe question of whether 144 tactile stimulators on a fingertip could be independently distinguished led to a confrontation at a scientific conference between Bliss and Frank Geldard, a University of Virginia professor. Geldard had written a major book on the human senses and was a leading researcher on using the sense of touch to communicate information. When asked how many tactile stimulators should be used in a tactile display, he maintained that no more than 8 tactile stimulators could be independently distinguished, and these should be on widely separated parts of the body. Bliss’ data showing useful reading with 144 stimulators on a fingertip appeared to be in conflict with Geldard's research. The difference was between communicating using two dimensional tactile images versus an 8-point code. Both Bliss and Geldard were reporting similar reading rates, but in the days before high accuracy optical character recognition, the Optacon approach was much more practical.\n\nThese experiments determined the design parameters for Optacon's man-machine interface: a 24-by-6 array of tactile stimulators, vibrating between 250 and 300 Hz, and with the rows spaced at 1 mm and the columns spaced at 2 mm (See Fig. 2).\n\nIn parallel with this human factors research was a pioneering effort to realize this design in a convenient portable unit, which would be critical for its success. In July 1972, Harry Garland suggested a new design for the Optacon that incorporated the sensor, tactile array, and electronics in a single hand-held unit. Roger Melen and Max Maginness developed a prototype of the unit, called the \"one-hand\" Optacon, at Stanford University.\n\nIn the 1960s, when the Optacon was being developed, integrated circuitry was in its infancy, and no suitable integrated solid state arrays of photo detectors was available. The earliest complete Optacon-like reading aids were built at Stanford and SRI with a lens system that focused the images from the printed page on a fiber optic bundle with individual fibers connected to discrete phototransistors. Not only was this system large and bulky, it was expensive and difficult to assemble. An effort was launched to develop a monolithic silicon retina with an array of 24-by-6 phototransistors about the size of one letter space so simple optics with no magnification could be used. Basic research in integrated circuit technology available at that time had to be conducted, resulting in Ph.D. theses by several Stanford graduate students, including J. S. Brugler, J. D Plummer, R. D. Melen, and P. Salsbury. The phototransistors had to be sufficiently sensitive, fast enough for the required refresh rate, have a spectral response appropriate for detecting ink on paper, in a closely packed matrix without blind spots, and interconnected so only connections to the rows and columns were needed.\n\nThe successful fabrication of such a silicon retina was a major milestone toward a practical Optacon.\n\nThe first Optacon prototype using this retina was completed on September 1, 1969. It was portable and completely self-contained in that it combined the stimulator array, electronics, batteries, and camera in a single package measuring 13.5″ by 8″ by 2.25″. The total weight was 9 pounds. The low power electronics design in this unit was a joint effort by J. S. Brugler and W. T. Young which made possible about 12 hours of sustained operation from the rechargeable batteries. This unit included an improved optical system and camera plus a tactile bimorph driven screen, both developed by James Baer and John Gill at SRI.\n\nAs integrated circuit technology progressed, another custom integrated circuit was developed in the Stanford laboratories. This integrated circuit contained 12 bimorph drivers and interfaced between the 5 Volt circuitry and the 45 Volts required to drive the bimorphs. The incorporation of this circuit and the use of lower power components enabled the size to be reduced to 8″ by 6″ by 2″ and the weight to be reduced to four pounds. Again the team of Brugler, Young, Baer, and Gill were responsible for the design of electronics, optics, and packaging. The first Optacon incorporating these advances, Model S-15, was a significant milestone. It won an IR-100 Award as one of 100 best designed products in 1971 and was the prototype of the Telesensory Optacon. It is now at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.\n\nWith a number of operational prototype Optacons available, an effort was made to get them in daily use by blind people in the community. The engineers were anxious to know how well the Optacon components held up in a real life environment, what uses were made of the Optacon, how much was it used, and how important was it in educational, vocational, and daily living. Several blind people in the Palo Alto community volunteered to participate, and Carolyn Weil was hired to coordinate, teach, and document this part of the project.\n\nThe first issue was how should a blind person be taught to read with and Optacon? Some blind people were unaware of letter shapes, and most were not familiar with the various type fonts. In addition spelling was usually not a strong point, since the education of blind students had often been in Braille, which has about 180 contractions. Of course, none were familiar with recognizing vibratory tactile images of letters moving across their index finger.\n\nWeil developed lessons to teach recognition of letters presented in this fashion using both the computer simulation and the Optacon prototypes. It soon became apparent that while letter recognition could be taught in a few days, building reading speed was much more time consuming. However, there were soon a number of blind people effectively using an Optacon prototype in their daily lives. These people contributed greatly to the project not only in providing important information for the design of future models, but also for motivating the Optacon development team toward making the Optacon widespread. Among this group of pioneering Optacon users were:\n\nThe Optacon was manufactured and marketed from 1971 to 1996 by Telesensory Systems Inc. of Silicon Valley, California. Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, the Optacon underwent upgrades, including the development of a new model, known as the Optacon II, which featured improved capabilities to interface to a computer.\n\nAs the Optacon project progressed and more obstacles and unknowns were overcome, the importance of making the Optacon generally available was apparent. TeleSensory's initial sales were to provide Optacons for test evaluations for the U.S. Office of Education, St. Dunstan's for blinded veterans in London, England, the Berufsbildungswerk in Heidelberg, Germany, and Sweden. The success of these evaluations led to larger dissemination programs funded by the U.S. Department of Education, private U.S. foundations such as Melen and Pew, state Departments of Rehabilitation, and various programs in many countries around the world such as Japan, Italy, Germany, France, and Scandinavia. The number of Optacons purchased privately by individuals was small. Approximately 15,000 Optacons were eventually sold.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, the Optacon underwent upgrades, and various accessories were added, including different lens modules to be used with the camera for reading text in a typewriter and on computer and calculator screens. In 1985 Canon Inc. and Telesensory cooperated in the development of the Optacon II, which featured improved packaging and capabilities to interface to a computer (See Fig. 3).\n\nThe design decision to reduce the number of image pixels from 144 to 100 to lower cost resulted in Optacon II not being successful.\n\nIn the 1990s Telesensory increasingly shifted its emphasis toward the low-vision market and became less devoted to the Optacon. Page scanners with optical character recognition had come to be the tool of choice for blind people wanting access to print. Page scanners were less expensive and had a much shallower learning curve than the Optacon. In addition, blind people could generally read through material more quickly with a page scanner than with an Optacon.\n\nIn 1996 Telesensory announced that it would no longer manufacture the Optacon and that it would cease to service the device in 2000. Many users purchased used machines and cannibalized them for parts, presumably with much help from sighted, electromechanically-talented friends. In March 2005, TSI suddenly shut down. Employees were \"walked out\" of the building and lost accrued vacation time, medical insurance, and all benefits. Customers could not buy new machines or get existing machines fixed. Some work was done by other companies to develop an updated version of the Optacon to reduce the cost of the device and take advantage of newer technology, but no device with the versatility of the Optacon had been developed as of 2007.\n\nMany blind people continue to use their Optacons to this day. The Optacon offers capabilities that no other device offers including the ability to see a printed page or computer screen as it truly appears including drawings, typefaces, and specialized text layouts.\n\n"}

The phrase was generally used in the United Kingdom by Conservatives to attack the New Labour government's behaviour. It should not be confused with double taxation or privatisation.\n\nOn 16 September 1996 the National Association of Pension Funds demanded a reverse to a tax on UK pension funds' dividends. Anne Robinson, their director general said pension funds are being \"taxed by stealth\".\n\nThe exact phrasing \"stealth tax\" has been in British political use since 1998 and referred to tax rises that apparently circumvented the 1997 New Labour manifesto commitment that \"over the five years of a Labour government ... there will be no increase in the basic or top rates of income tax\".\n\nAnne Segall of The Daily Telegraph claimed on 17 January 1998\nthat, \"taxes will rise by £7 billion this year ... as a result of a variety of measures introduced or extended by the previous chancellor Gordon Brown. Mr Brown's 'stealth' taxes are directed mainly at middle-class voters and in particular at middle-class professionals and those with savings\".\n\nOn October 19, 1998 Francis Maude, then Shadow Chancellor (the opposition finance minister) claimed the Chancellor Gordon Brown was imposing \"stealth taxes ... designed to conceal their effect\".\n\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair only made occasional references to stealth taxes, such as on 1 November 2001 in relation to Company Car taxation, 9 November 2000 in relation to Fuel prices and on 21 October 2002 in reference to Pensions.\n\nOn 22 May 2001, the expression \"increasing taxes by stealth\" was extensively used by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on her address to the Conservative Party's rally in Plymouth.\n\nOne example of a stealth tax is in the United Kingdom, where the British Government diverted revenue from the National Lottery to fund public spending.\n\nAnother form of stealth taxation occurs when deductions or exemptions are reduced based on income level resulting in more taxable income, but the same tax rate for a higher total tax. Under 2007 US tax law 1040 Schedule A itemized deductions and the $3,400 personal exemption are phased out (reduced) at higher income levels ($234,600 for married filers).\n\nStealth taxes might be recognized as taxation but remain largely unnoticed, as with Value Added Tax (VAT) in the UK between 1979 and 1991, during which period it rose from 8% first to 15% (compensating for a large reduction in the higher and basic rates of income tax) then to 17.5% (when the Poll Tax was replaced by a council tax), somewhat shifting the burden of taxation away from income onto consumption.\n\nAnother example of a stealth tax is in South Australia, where Australian Government cut down budget for SA state households, South Australia state government increases the rate of Emergency Services Levy (ESL), so that get more tax from households.\n\nStealth taxes can be viewed as regressive, as more affluent people are less affected by VAT, for example. State lotteries may also be viewed as a form of taxation, and there is evidence that they are played more by poor people than by the affluent.\n\nIn January 1999 Conservative culture spokesman Peter Ainsworth described the National Lottery's New Opportunities fund as a \"stealth tax\". and Conservative leader William Hague claimed \"The Labour stealth tax amounts to £1,500 for every working person\". In Parliament on 3 November 1999 William Hague \"accused the government of levying a £500 million 'stealth tax' that would hit IT companies\".\n"}

American agents he ran for the Soviets include Laurence Duggan, Mary Price, and Michael Straight (the last knew Akhmerov as \"Michael Green\"). Places he likely lived during that time include New York City and Baltimore.\n\nIn 1945, Akhmerov returned again to the Soviet Union to become deputy chief of the KGB's 'illegal' intelligence section (отдел нелегальной разведки ). He attained the rank of colonel.\n\nAkhmerov is known to have used the cover names \"William Grienke\", \"Michael Green\", \"Michael Adamec\", and several others while in the United States. His code names in the Venona project decrypts of Soviet intelligence messages are \"MAYOR\" and \"ALBERT\".\n\nHede Massing describes a Soviet \"rezident\" in the United States named \"Bill Grinke,\" \"Bill,\" and \"Walter Grinke,\" whom she describes as a \"pedestrian\" man, looking about 40 years old, who took her on from Valentin Markin at the end of 1934. When Massing reported her encounters with Noel Field, she was reporting to \"Bill\": she had met Field through \"Daily Worker\" journalist Marguerite Young. By \"May or June 1935,\" another \"rezident\" named \"Fred\" had taken over from \"Bill,\" at which point she began to \"develop\" Field. In January or February 1937, just before Ignace Reiss defected from the Soviet underground, Massing received an assignment to spy on Ludwig Lore, and \"Bill\" resumed her management.\n\nScholars John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr report that the FBI considered Elizabeth Bentley's \"Bill\" to be Akhmerov.\n\nScholar Raymond W. Raymond stated that \"Walter Grinke\" was known to Whittaker Chambers and Elizabeth Bentley as \"Bill\" – and that he worked for Amtorg.\n\nAkhmerov spoke Turkish, English and French.\n\nHe married Helen Lowry (AKA \"Elza Akhmerova\"), a niece of the CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder and who also worked for Soviet intelligence. She was also a \"full partner\" in his espionage.\n\nHe died in 1976.\n\nAkhmerov received the Order of the Red Banner twice, the Order of the Badge of Honor, and the badge of Honored Chekist.\n\n On April 7, 2011, a memorial plaque was unveiled in honor of the 110th anniversary of Akhmerov's birth.\n\nOn April 16, 2015, a monument for Akhmerov was unveiled at the Scarlet Field in Chelyabinsk.\n\nAs chief of KGB in the US during WWII, Akhmerov's name appears on many decrypted Venona documents, as does his wife. During WWII, he served as one of three major contacts for comrade Vasily Zarubin. He also ran the Perlo group of Victor Perlo, which had reported previously to Jacob Golos and Elizabeth Bentley. Cables also mention the Silvermaster group under Nathan Gregory Silvermaster.\n\n"}

The name is Welsh, and probably means \"On (the brook called) Rhath\".\n\nAmroth lies in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and is the southern start of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, part of the national Cistercian Way.\n\nThe beach stretches the whole length of the village and at extreme low tide one can still see the petrified forest, destroyed when sea levels rose 7,000 years ago, while fossilised antlers, nuts, animal bones and Neolithic flints have been discovered. The parish was an important anthracite coal mining area until the end of the 19th century. Slight remains of mines and tramways are still visible. Ruins of Amroth Castle still remain, and one mile inland is the Anglican parish church of St Elidyr, which is a grade II* listed building.\n\nAmroth Castle stands on the north side of the unclassified coast road east of the village of Amroth. It is surrounded by a high wall with an entrance archway at the south-western corner. The present building is a 19th-century country house built in the style of a mock castle which possibly replaced a small stone castle dating from the 12th century. The gatehouse is much restored. The ruinous remains of the house are a grade I listed building.\n\nAfter passing through several hands the castle was used as a lunatic asylum in the 1850s. Converted back to a private house in the 1880s it was later owned and occupied by Owen Colby Philipps, the shipping magnate who bought the White Star Line and was created Baron Kylsant of Carmarthen and Amroth in 1923. It passed to his daughter Nesta, who had married George Coventry, grandson of the 9th Earl of Coventry. They moved out in 1930 when George inherited the Coventry title and estates.\n\nAmroth is an electoral ward and a community in Pembrokeshire, which includes Amroth, Crunwere, Summerhill, Stepaside, Pleasant Valley, Wisemans Bridge, Llanteg and Llanteglos. The ward elects a councillor to Pembrokeshire County Council and up to twelve community councillors to Amroth Community Council.\n\n"}

{"id": "2274727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274727", "title": "Goose Lake International Music Festival", "text": "Goose Lake International Music Festival\n\nThe Goose Lake International Music Festival held August 7–9, 1970 in Leoni Township, Michigan, \"was one of the largest music events of its era\", and featured many of the top rock music bands of the period.\n\nThe festival took place nearly one year after Woodstock, and the Goose Lake promoters set out to create a better planned event with better facilities for rock fans than Woodstock. The lead promoter was Richard Songer, a wealthy 35-year-old man who had been successful in the construction business. Songer teamed up with experienced Detroit disc jockey and promoter, Russ Gibb, and his associate, Tom Wright, to help plan the festival.\n\nGoose Lake Park was built on 390 acres of land, with a budget of $1 million, and was billed as the \"world's first permanent festival site\". It was projected that 60,000 fans would attend the first festival.\n\nThe stage was built on a large, revolving turntable with two performance spaces so that the previous band could disassemble its gear and the next band set up while the current band was performing. At the end of each performance, the stage would rotate 180 degrees, and the next act would begin performing almost immediately. The backstage area had a tent where 20 to 30 groupies described as \"sizzlers\" were available for the performers.\n\nThose who attended were provided free campsites, free parking and free firewood. There were restrooms and showers every 500 feet, medical staff, motorcycle and dune buggy trails, a lake with a beach, and also the \"longest slide in the world\". To keep gate crashers out, the site was surrounded by a high chain-link fence topped by barbed wire.\n\nThe admission price for the three-day event was $15.00, and entry tokens in the style of poker chips were sold to avoid the counterfeiting of paper tickets.\n\nBefore the festival, concerned local officials sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the event, but a judge denied the request. Many Canadian rock fans were turned back at border crossings and were unable to attend.\n\nNational and international acts performing at the festival included Faces featuring Rod Stewart, Jethro Tull, Chicago, Ten Years After, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Mountain, John Sebastian, the James Gang featuring Joe Walsh, The Flock and The Litter. \n\nNotable Detroit area bands performing included Bob Seger, the MC5, The Stooges, Detroit featuring Mitch Ryder, Brownsville Station, Savage Grace, Third Power and SRC. Masters of ceremonies were Teegarden & Van Winkle, who also performed. Dave Alexander of the Stooges was dismissed by the band after a disastrous performance.\n\nSavoy Brown, Joe Cocker and Alice Cooper were announced acts that did not perform due to contractual problems.\n\nAn estimated 200,000 rock music fans attended the festival. The initial attitude of the \"young, hip police force\" toward the fans in attendance was to \"leave them alone\", at least when they were inside the festival grounds. The festival was known for widespread, openly visible drug sales and public nudity.\n\nJohn Laycock of the \"Windsor Star\" praised the festival, writing that \"The Organization Men of Goose Lake have resurrected the spirit of Woodstock without the discomforts\" and that \"the giant amphitheatre was superbly equipped.\" Laycock mentioned the performances of Frost, Savage Grace, Chicago, The Flock, Jethro Tull, John Sebastian, Faces, Ten Years After, Mountain and The Flying Burrito Brothers as particularly memorable. Tom Wright, who was responsible for staging and logistics at the festival, including design of the revolving stage, reported that it had gone off \"virtually hitch free\".\n\nThe rotating stage was a success. Record store owner Dave Bernath remembered, \"The band would literally hit their last note, say 'thank you' and 'goodbye,' they spun around and the next band started within a minute — in seconds! The first band was still fading out when the other band came on! That's the way it should be!\"\n\nDespite some problems, \"most fans and musicians recall a sunny attitude surrounding the weekend\". Rod Stewart enjoyed his Friday night performance so much that he stayed to watch Alvin Lee perform with Ten Years After the following night.\n\nThe participation of the White Panther Party and the affiliated Serve the People (STP) Coalition added some \"street credibility\" to the event. The festival took place at the time of the 25th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and peace groups publicized an anti-nuclear weapons message during the event.\n\nDetroit rock historian David A. Carson wrote that \"drugs took center stage\" at Goose Lake, and that the park was \"reminiscent of Attica\" because of the barbed wire topped perimeter fence. There was a report of a rape by a group of bikers while The Stooges were performing.\n\nThere were 160 arrests of those leaving after the event, mostly on drug charges. Jackson County sheriff Charles Southworth estimated that \"75% of the youths were on drugs\"\n\nExtensive newspaper coverage concentrated on the open drug sales and use at the festival. Michigan governor William Milliken denounced the \"deplorable and open sale and use of drugs\" at the festival, and called for investigation and prosecution of the \"drug pushers\" who were present. Michigan attorney general Frank J. Kelley said \"I think we have seen the first and last rock concert of that size in Michigan\".\n\nPromoter Richard Songer was indicted for promoting the sale of drugs. He was acquitted in December 1971. The district attorney obtained an injunction barring any other public shows at the park. No further rock festivals took place at Goose Lake.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2274728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274728", "title": "Siegfried and Nightmare", "text": "Siegfried and Nightmare\n\nSiegfried is a young German knight that, driven mad after unknowingly killing his father, becomes possessed by the evil sword Soul Edge and physically transforms into the demon known as Nightmare. Though Siegfried does temporarily regain his sanity after Nightmare is defeated by Xianghua in \"Soulcalibur\" (only to be taken over by Soul Edge again shortly after), it is not until after the events of \"Soulcalibur II\" that he is freed from the sword's control entirely and went on to pierce the cursed sword using Soul Calibur. He then seeks atonement for the atrocities he committed as Nightmare. In their final confrontation in \"Soulcalibur IV\", Siegfried successfully destroyed Soul Edge and freed himself from the evil power.\n\nNightmare first appeared in one of the possible endings for the Siegfried character in \"Soul Edge\". In the sequel \"Soulcalibur\", he was given a name and featured as a central character. Ever since then, Nightmare has been the owner of the powerful evil sword Soul Edge, and thus the objective of most other characters in the story. Appearing in every game of the series, Nightmare has served as a recurring antagonist in contrast to the protagonist role played by Siegfried, as well as serving as Siegfried's archenemy.\n\nIn his \"Soul Edge\" debut, Siegfried is a 16-year-old former child of Frederick Schtauffen, a brave knight in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation following the Italian Wars. Named by his mother after the legendary Germanic hero Sigurd, Siegfried had joined a band of brigands called the Schwarzwind after his father has had left on a foreign crusade, only to unintentionally kill his own returning father during an ambush. Driven insane by this act, Siegfried convinced himself that someone else was to blame for his father's death, thus embarking on a journey to find the legendary weapon known as Soul Edge and use it to take revenge.\n\nHe traveled first to Ostrheinsburg Castle belonging to the noble Stefan, who he believed to be the possessor of Soul Edge; and he joined in its forces as a Landsknecht, rising in its ranks with the hopes of acquiring Stefan's blade. During a siege on the castle, Siegfried saw an opportunity to kill Stefan, running off with his prized possession into the Black Woods, but the sword held no power. Frustrated, he continued to search for the real Soul Edge, growing increasingly more insane for its power as time passed. He finally managed to come across the real Soul Edge, lying beside the corpse of the corrupted pirate Cervantes de Leon that lit up in a hellish blaze of fire and attacked him. Siegfried raised his mighty zweihänder and defeated his lingering spirit, the fiery demon Inferno, breaking his sword in the process and earning the right to wield the Soul Edge for himself. But at the moment that Siegfried obtained the cursed blade, the Evil Seed emanated from him in a beam of light that rained across the entire world, leading only to death and destruction. Soul Edge tempted Siegfried to wield it with a promise to resurrect his dead father in exchange for gathering souls for its consumption. Not knowing that he is just being used, Siegfried agreed and started killing people to gather souls. Eventually, Soul Edge consumed him and Nightmare is born, transforming him into the Azure Knight.\n\nIn \"Soulcalibur Legends\", Siegfried is saved from the Evil Seed by a group sent by the Masked Emperor to investigate it. Once brought to him, the Emperor requested that he resurrect Soul Edge to defeat the Ottoman Sultan Barbaros, who wielded Soul Calibur. The Emperor reminded the reluctant Siegfried of his father - who lived in the Empire's service and died protecting it - and he finally accepted the request, starting a journey alongside Ivy Valentine and court jester Iska Farkas. Siegfried travels around the world, gathering Soul Edge's shards and receiving help from Sophitia, Astaroth, Mitsurugi, Taki and Lloyd Irving, eventually forming a bond with them, despite the fact that they all wish to either take Soul Edge away from him or destroy it. Along the way, Siegfried manages to defeat several Guardians of the Soul Edge shards and restore Soul Edge's power. Using it, Siegfried defeats Barbaros. The Masked Emperor gets Soul Calibur and reveals that she planned to defend her people by annihilating all possible enemies with the combined powers of it and Soul Edge. However, she is unsuccessful in seizing Soul Edge from Siegfried, and an event seemingly similar to the Evil Seed takes place during their battle. He defeats Inferno when the demon tries to stop him in the form of Nightmare and succeeds in sealing Soul Edge, replacing it with the sword Requiem. Siegfried saves his allies, and together they march against the Empire's army. He confronts and defeats the Masked Emperor and stop her conquest. As he leaves her, Soul Calibur, and Soul Edge behind, Iska betrays him and takes both swords but Siegfried emerges victorious. As Iska dies he exclaims that in the end all will betray Siegfried and that only those with power will prevail in the end, leaving those without it to suffer and ultimately die. As Siegfried leaves, he takes the unsealed Soul Edge with him again.\n\nIn \"Soulcalibur\", his group of followers (Astaroth, Aeon Calcos, and Ivy) aided him in Soul Edge's quest to devour souls for a resurrection ceremony to be performed in his chosen stronghold, Ostrheinsburg. But as the ceremony was about to take place, both Aeon Calcos and Astaroth have been defeated, and Ivy had left after learning the truth of her past from Taki. Two young warriors confronted Nightmare: Kilik and Xianghua. After a raging battle, the evil sword shattered and Siegfried regained some of his humanity and managed to briefly break free from Soul Edge's control. But along came the memories of the sins he committed when he was consumed by Soul Edge. Moreover, he realized that he had been the one who murdered his father, and that his \"resurrection\" was only an illusion brought by his mind. Siegfried meditated on all he had done and decided that if he was to be successful in his new resolve, he must distance himself from the civilized society so that he never kills again. He could not see his mother until he was fully redeemed.\n\nBy \"Soulcalibur II\", the balance between the restored Soul Edge and Siegfried was broken, and Soul Edge was able to take over Siegfried's mind. He has been well aware that although he had regained his sanity and learned to accept his past sins, he was not yet fully redeemed. At first it was for short periods of time during his sleep, but eventually he took Siegfried's body completely and used him to cause destruction once more. Four years passed, as he had assumed the azure armor for a second time, becoming Nightmare all over again, desperately pursuing fragments of the Soul Edge that he might fully restore it. As Nightmare plundered powerful souls and recovered shattered fragments, the cracks in Soul Edge healed one by one. His goal nearing completion, Nightmare returned to Ostrheinsburg for the restoration of the evil sword's true power. Raphael Sorel, a French former-nobleman pursuing the blade for his own scheme, challenged Nightmare and was completely defeated, but managed to pierce Soul Edge's eye with his rapier in one final attack when Siegfried's will awakened and he struggled to free his mind from the influence of evil. The sword now in agony lost control over Siegfried, and allowed him to defeat Inferno and break free once again. Siegfried then discovered Soul Calibur, released from Inferno's body after its defeat, and impaled Soul Edge's eye with it. Both swords sealed, Siegfried abandoned his old armor and left with them, swearing to seal away Soul Edge for all eternity and atone for his sins.\n\nHis fate would not release him so easily, however. In \"Soulcalibur III\", Zasalamel revived \"Nightmare\" in essence. Created as an avatar for a disembodied Inferno using the original armor as a shell, he pursued and eventually recovered his true body, Soul Edge. Nightmare also met Tira, who became his servant and manipulated others into protecting Soul Edge and sacrificing souls for Nightmare, to eventually become sacrifices themselves. Meanwhile, Zasalamel manipulated Siegfried, leading him to Nightmare, and wielding Soul Calibur, he clashed against Soul Edge. At the moment the swords struck a burst of energy was released; Siegfried was mortally wounded, while Soul Edge and its body were pulled into a warped dimension, eventually returning to Ostrheinsburg.\n\nIn \"Soulcalibur IV\", Soul Calibur revived Siegfried, while Inferno restored Soul Edge fully and strengthened his hold over the animated armor that was Nightmare. Inferno then claimed the entire city of Ostrheinsburg as a vessel due to the fact that Nightmare lacked the capacity to contain his consciousness, and as a result, the city became cursed and many of its inhabitants were corrupted. Tira continued serving Nightmare and manipulating Astaroth, Sophitia and others into serving Soul Edge, in order to weaken Soul Calibur and provide Nightmare with the strength necessary to destroy the spirit sword. Nightmare would then clash against Siegfried in a final duel, though his plans were interfered with the appearance of Algol and the Tower of Remembrance.\n\nAs revealed in \"Soulcalibur V\", Siegfried gathered his staunchest allies from the Schwarzwind, having reformed the bandits into mercenaries, including Hildegard von Krone and Viola. One day, after more than a decade of service protecting humanity from the malfested, Siegfried discovered that Soul Calibur had transformed into a new one-handed sword—a clear harbinger of Soul Edge's return. A new champion to wield Soul Calibur would need to be found and the now 40-year-old Siegfried assigned the task to the young Z.W.E.I., a wandering swordsman who had joined his group. Meanwhile, Soul Edge regained consciousness with what little pieces of it were found and collected by its servants; allowing Nightmare to gain a new body and assume the alias of Graf Dumas. From there, Dumas worked his way into the grace of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to be awarded the Kingdom of Hungary, exploiting the war with the Ottomans to initiate a widespread search to find the remaining fragments to restore Soul Edge to its former glory, while simultaneously wanted to consume more souls under the guise of massacring the \"malfested\", the cursed sword's minions. Unknown to him however, his former servant, Tira had been working to create a new Nightmare as she is not satisfied with Dumas. One of his soldier, Patroklos Alexander; whom he manipulated for the massacre in exchange for searching his sister Pyrrha, revolted and fled from service. Dumas eventually met with Patroklos and Pyrrha again; this time revealing himself as Nightmare, and forced Pyrrha's hidden Soul Edge power to consume her, causing Patroklos to abandon her. Nightmare then initiated a war throughout Europe with his newfound power, but is eventually struck down and killed by Z.W.E.I., whom he previously tried to hunt before. Though after Pyrrha Omega kills Z.W.E.I., Inferno made her his new host for Soul Edge, but was eventually defeated by Patrokalos and together the siblings use Soul Edge to Piece Soul Calibur and sealing them back into the Astral Chaos.\n\nSiegfried also appeared playable in \"\", where he is 40-years-old.\n\n\"Soulcalibur VI\" serves as a reboot timeline after the event of \"Soulcalibur V\", immediately takes place in the beginning of the second \"Soul\" game's reboot storyline, the original \"Soulcalibur\", rather than beginning of \"SoulEdge\". Shortly after becoming Nightmare, Siegfried slaughters thousands of innocents in an attempt to resurrect his father, with Soul Edge mimicking Frederick's voice to manipulate Siegfried. Nightmare is eventually defeated by Kilik and Xianghua. After the Azure Knight's defeat, Siegfried reawakens in a nearby forest wracked with guilt over his memories of his atrocities as Nightmare and his role in his father's death. After facing off against multiple people who want revenge on him for Nightmare's crimes, his soul is partially purified by Sophitia, giving him the motivation to take down Soul Edge for good. After hearing the voice of Soul Calibur cry for help, he grips Soul Edge and becomes Nightmare once more to prevent Soul Edge from consuming Soul Calibur. He then waits for his chance to regain control of his body once more.\n\nOutside of the \"Soul\" series, Nightmare appeared in \"Seme COM Dungeon: Drururuaga\" where the player can obtain him as an \"ally\" and use his armor along with Soul Edge. Soul Edge also appeared as an enemy in \"Namco x Capcom\" where its shards became Charade and was fought as enemies, and made a cameo in \"Retro Game Challenge\". A Sackboy costume of Nightmare was released as a DLC for \"LittleBigPlanet 3\".\n\nIn 2000, Epoch C-Works released a series of action figures based upon the original \"Soulcalibur\", amongst them Nightmare. The semi-posable figure came with equipable weapons from the title in the same package. In 2003, Todd McFarlane Productions released a Nightmare sculpture amongst a set of five based on characters from \"Soulcalibur II\". The immobile figure was modeled after his primary outfit and stood six inches tall with a base. In the web series \"Death Battle\", Nightmare fought Guts, the protagonist from \"Berserk\", in his standard, Night Terror, and Inferno forms. He lost as Guts was able to cut through Soul Edge in half.\n\nSiegfried and Nightmare both appear in \"Soulcalibur\" manga and make a guest appearance as cards in a mobile video game \"Outcast Odyssey\" and in many cards in \"Universal Fighting System\". They are also both featured on the official \"Soulcalibur VI\" arcade stick.\n\nIn his debut, Siegfried appeared as a young man with short blond hair and blue eyes, covered in simple knight armor. Following his redemption in \"Soulcalibur\" and beyond, he retains the armor but his hair has grown longer, past shoulder length. During \"Soulcalibur\"\" he also gains a long scar dashing over his right eye. In \"Soulcalibur III\", he returns with armor bearing the motif of a phoenix as well as feathers on his pauldrons. As of \"Soulcalibur IV\", his armor remains the same, but a second layer of crystalline armor covers with an intricate design and wields Soul Calibur instead of Requiem. He also gains a long blue scarf as well, completing the 'knight in shining armor' visage. His weapon in Soul Edge was originally Faust, a simple zweihander (two-handed sword) with a basic design, but swapped it for Requiem, a large blade with a flat end and a black lining in the center. He continues to use this sword from \"Soulcalibur\" all the way to \"Soulcalibur III\" and resumes its use in \"Soulcalibur V\". In \"Soulcalibur V\", Siegfried's appearance begins to take on the traits of his father, and has grown a stubble. His hair is swept up with a couple bangs hanging down and his scar still remains. In all games, he is left-handed.\n\nUsually a standalone character, Siegfried is an unlockable character in \"Soulcalibur.\" In \"Soulcalibur II\", he only appears as Nightmare's alternate costumes. The 2P costume is Siegfried mid-transition into Nightmare, featuring his human form with a grotesque dragon-like arm, a golden right eye and ruined armor based off his Soulcalibur design. Nightmare's bonus costume is Siegfried in standard platemail without any mutations to his body.\n\nEven though Nightmare originally debuted in \"Soulcalibur\", its predecessor, \"Soul Edge\", featured a prototype of his character. In the home version, an extra character named \"Siegfried!\" (an alternate version of normal Siegfried taken from his no-input ending, where he was consumed by the cursed sword Soul Edge) was added as an unlockable character. This early version has crimson armor and a more flesh-like design, almost as if he were part of Soul Edge itself; he has no story nor ending, and only used Siegfried's Soul Edge without effects. Nightmare has appeared as a playable character in all the main sequels to \"Soulcalibur\", visually different for each game.\n\nSiegfried's blade is powerful and has long range, but it has a slow swing. In addition to standard attacks, Siegfried fights with multiple stances. This allows him to mix up his attacks, allowing him to play mind games with his opponent. Mastering the stance changes will allow the player to maintain control over the battle and perform damaging combos against the opponent. 1UP.com recommended Siegfried in \"Soulcalibur IV\" for both beginners and experts of the series due to his easy combos despite his slow movements.\n\nNightmare's moveset before the events of \"Soulcalibur III\" was nearly identical to Siegfried's (barring a couple of exclusive moves in each moveset). However, Nightmare's fighting style was altered after Siegfried was freed from Inferno's influence between \"Soulcalibur II\" and \"Soulcalibur III\". Siegfried retained a majority of his old moveset while Nightmare's new moveset became a brutish twist of Siegfried's moveset. Nightmare's moveset relies far less on stances and mindgames and focuses more on overwhelming the opponent with strong blows and otherworldly might. As such, Siegfried is seen as a technical stance character focused on mindgames and mix ups while Nightmare is an aggressive rushdown character focused on punishing his opponent's mistakes with his raw power. Despite \"Soulcalibur VI\" being a reboot that takes place during the events of \"Soulcalibur\", Nightmare and Siegfried retain these differences in their movesets.\n\nInferno is the physical manifestation of the cursed sword Soul Edge's own soul and the true antagonist within \"Soul\" series, where it mostly started out as the final boss in \"Soul Edge\" (originally listed as \"SoulEdge\") until \"Soulcalibur II\", including the reboot/retelling game \"Soulcalibur VI\". It fights using the attack style of other fighters from its memories of past battles and will switch to a random one at the start of each round. Though it exists in its own dimension, Astral Chaos (a realm where time and space never exist), it has used duplicity such as in the case of tricking Siegfried into expanding its will, and in more extreme cases utilized Cervantes' flaming corpse and later the remnants of Nightmare's armor to create an avatar for itself. Within Astral Chaos, Inferno can manifest itself as a flaming and mostly skeletal body for itself, creating weapons to match whichever fighting style it currently uses, particularly Siegfried's being its primary likeness at most part.\n\nInferno, along with Soul Edge is destroyed by Siegfried at the end of \"Soulcalibur IV\", though its will continues to live in the leftover shards of Soul Edge and later manifests itself in a new Soul Edge. However, after the new Nightmare was slain, Inferno choose Pyrrha as its new host until being defeated by her brother and Soul Edge along with Soul Calibur were both sealed away in the astral chaos. Its will and power has, directly and indirectly, affected several other characters in the series, such as the Evil Seed event that caused many to turn somewhat evil or insane. It has also caused the creation of several life forms or modification of them, such as Ivy's sword, Charade, Necrid and Abyss.\n\nIn \"Soulcalibur VI\", Inferno's gameplay is similar to his original \"Soul Edge\" counterpart, as being more of an enhanced version of certain Soul Edge wielders than as a mimic fighter; in this case, its main alter-ego Nightmare instead of Cervantes. Due to his final boss role despite being an unlockable character, Inferno is banned from online matches and official tournaments.\n\n is the secret final boss of \"Soulcalibur III\", replacing the normal final boss Abyss if certain requirements are met. Its appearance has been a mystery as it is not player-controllable, is given very little mention in-game (its profile only stated that it is the result of Soul Edge and Soul Calibur fusing with Nightmare's remains), and does not appear or mentioned in future games. The official artbook of \"Soulcalibur V\" mentions the creature as the personification of \"Catastrophe\" residing in Astral Chaos who is very powerful that even Soul Calibur's creator, Algol avoids confronting it for the time being.\n\nNight Terror utilizes a complete version of Soul Edge as its weapon with a fighting style simply referred to as \"Memories of Nightmare?\". It borrows many moves from Nightmare, albeit greatly amplified, including having greater range and power or becoming unblockable. Notably, Night Terror is the only character in the history of the series who cannot be defeated by ring outs; whenever it is knocked off the stage, it simply flies back using its wings.\n\nSiegfried's overall reception in the series has been positive. Outlets such as Eurogamer, Gameplanet and GamesRadar commented positively on his redesigns for \"Soulcalibur IV,\" and \"Soulcalibur VI\". IGN has too praised Siegfied for an appealing design and a powerful yet graceful fighting style while listing him together with Nightmare at a top of their top ten list for the series in 2008, where they both were called \"a perfect representation of the series' core conflict,\" and opining that \"a Soul game simply feels incomplete without an appearance by the warring personalities of Siegfried and Nightmare.\" In 2013, \"Complex\" ranked Siegfried/Nightmare the best character in the series, citing his duality as the reason that makes the character \"one of the most fascinating characters in the entire series.\" In a preview of \"Soulcalibur V\", Siliconera said the franchise would not be same without Siegfried or Nightmare. The Gamer listed him as the 12th most powerful \"Soulcalibur\" character in 2017, praising his role and impact in the series.\n\nGameAxis Unwired expressed mixed thoughts about the character in \"Legends\" due to the fact he is the only playable character at first as the rest are unlockable. Additionally, the lack of his relationship with Nightmare not being featured as usual earned criticism. Expressing disappointment by the lack of famous characters in \"Soulcalibur V\", GameSpy noted that at least Siegfried's return might at least encourage him to play the game, citing lack of interest with the new cast.\n\nNightmare has received praise both as an aspect of Siegfried and as a series villain, and has been described as \"one of the most memorable fighting-game villains in history.\" \"The New York Times\" noted his size and appearance alongside Astaroth's as standouts in the series, adding \"they offer characters made for the sort of player who would have preferred Sonny Liston to Muhammad Ali, or Shaquille O'Neal to Michael Jordan.\" Others have been critical of the character's strength, such as \"JIVE Magazine\" which described him as one of several \"total crutches for mediocre players\" in \"Soulcalibur II\".\n\nNightmare placed first in UGO.com's \"Top 11 SoulCalibur Fighters\" article, with the writers statement \"Was there ever really any question? Not for us...\" and praise for his strength and role as a \"badass, playable villain.\" IGN listed him as a character they wished to see in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" as a playable guest villain, though noted he was also \"too extreme\" for the series. In a later article on the \"Soul\" series itself, they noted \"a \"Soul\" game simply feels incomplete without an appearance by the warring personalities of Siegfried and Nightmare\", and praised the contrast between Siegfried's angelic figure and Nightmare's demonic form. In \"Game Informer\"s 2009 list of best fighting game characters, Nightmare placed second.\n\nIn a 2002 poll by Namco prior to the release of \"Soulcalibur II\" regarding their favorite character, Siegfried placed ninth with 2.5% of the tally, tied with Mitsurugi. In Bandai Namco's 2015 poll, Siegfried was voted the sixth most popular characters from the series, followed by Nightmare.\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds, Minnesota Twins, Boston Red Sox, Atlanta Braves and Chicago White Sox.\n\nMiller saw action in parts of 11 seasons in the major leagues and he played in parts of 17 seasons in the minor leagues, batting a cumulative .193 whilst in the majors and .248 in the minors. He played in a franchise-record ten seasons with the Louisville Bats, the AAA-affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds from 2001 to 2004, then again from 2009 to 2014, and is currently the Louisville franchise's all-time leader in games played with 548.\n\nMiller was a star baseball and football player at Yucaipa High School in Yucaipa, California. His accolades include first-team All-State and All-CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) honors while leading the T-Birds to the CIF titles in 1993 and 1994. He was also first-team All-CIF in football. He was inducted into the Yucaipa High School Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nAfter high school, Miller was drafted by the California Angels in the 23rd round (629th overall) of the 1994 Major League Baseball Draft, but he did not sign, opting to attend the University of Nevada, Reno. Miller was a career .356 hitter in his two seasons for the Wolf Pack (1997 and 1998). Miller led the team in hitting in 1998 with a .377 batting average. His on-base percentages in two seasons were .470 in 1997 and .514 in 1998. He owns the school's single-season record for getting hit by a pitch (28 in 1998) and he was hit 54 times in his two seasons.\n\nMiller signed with the Cincinnati Reds as an undrafted free agent in 1998. Miller played for the Billings Mustangs, in Billings Montana. He made his Major League debut at age 25 on September 4, 2001, in a 7-1 Reds home loss to the Houston Astros, a game which he started and went hitless in three at-bats. He got his first big-league hit six days later, a single off Tony McKnight in a 3-1 road loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Miller remained with the Reds organization through 2004.\n\nMiller played in five games with 12 plate appearances for the Minnesota Twins in 2005. In 2005, he also pitched for the first time in a professional game with the Twins AAA-affiliate the Rochester Red Wings. (He has since pitched a number of times—using a knuckleball—for the Louisville Bats.)\n\nHe was signed by the Boston Red Sox on April 25, 2006, and added to the Pawtucket Red Sox Triple-A roster. Miller was promoted to Boston on August 5, , but his tenure in Boston would not last long. After appearing in just one game (a 7-6 defeat against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on August 6, 2006), Miller would be designated for assignment on August 14, 2006, to make room for Craig Breslow, who was promoted from Pawtucket.\n\nMiller was granted free agency after the season and signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves.\n\nOn July 31, , the Braves called up Miller to fill up the backup catcher role after previous backup catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia was traded that day. He made his debut on August 2, hitting a pinch-hit infield single. On August 5, Miller hit a game-tying RBI double, his first extra-base hit since , against the Colorado Rockies. On September 15, Miller hit his first home run since 2002.\n\nOn August 1, , Miller was designated for assignment, and was eventually sent outright to the minors. He returned to the Braves' active roster on September 1.\n\nMiller became a free agent following the 2008 season and signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox.\n\nAs a non-roster invitee to White Sox spring training, Miller impressed enough to be awarded the back-up catcher's role to A. J. Pierzynski. In his first regular season game for the White Sox on April 11, 2009 (vs. the Minnesota Twins) Miller went 2-4, with 2 RBI and a run scored. The game resulted in an 8-0 White Sox victory.\n\nOn June 26, 2009, Miller was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for outfielder Norris Hopper. On August 25, 2009, Miller was called up to the Cincinnati Reds from the Louisville Bats. He became a free agent following the season, but re-signed to a minor league deal.\n\nMiller started the 2010 season not on the Reds 40-man roster, but after the injury of Ryan Hanigan, he was placed on the active roster and took over backup duties to Ramón Hernández. He continued to fill the backup role, now with Hanigan and Hernandez switching spots on the disabled list. His starts came mostly as catcher for the Reds' young arms, such as Travis Wood and Matt Maloney, since he caught them in Louisville. He was outrighted back to Louisville on July 22, 2010, after Hanigan came back from the DL. Miller was called up on September 1. The Reds outrighted him from the roster in the offseason and he refused his assignment, becoming a free agent. They re-signed him to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training.\n\nOn April 21, 2013, Miller was promoted to the Reds, replacing the injured Ryan Hanigan. He made his first start of the season on April 23, 2013, against the Chicago Cubs. The Reds lost this game in extra innings. On May 10, 2013, Miller was outrighted back to Louisville, after Hanigan was activated from the DL. He was called up by the Reds again on July 11, 2013, after placing Hanigan on the disabled list again. On August 7 Miller started behind the plate and hit two RBI doubles in the game before leaving in the fifth inning after a home plate collision; he was later placed on the 15-day disabled list. Miller played in a total of 17 games with the Reds in 2013.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2013 regular season, the Reds outrighted him from the roster. He refused his assignment, becoming a free agent. However, during the Reds annual Redsfest an unsigned Miller appeared signing autographs. Miller would resign to a minor league deal with the Reds the next day.\n\nMiller started the 2014 season in Triple-A Louisville. Miller served as a primary catcher for the Bats due to Tucker Barnhart starting the season in Cincinnati with Devin Mesoraco on the DL. On April 13, 2014, while pitching for the Bats, Miller used a knuckleball to strike out a batter.\n\nMiller was placed on the inactive list in May before being placed on the disabled list in June for a back strain. The Bats announced on August 5, 2014 that they would retire Miller's jersey. Corky Miller is known to many Louisville Bats baseball fans for his mustache, but he’ll be remembered by his No. 8 jersey, the first to be retired by the franchise. Who at the time of his retirement held the franchise record for number of games played.\n\nCorky Miller was added to the Reds single A affiliate team, Dayton Dragons coaching staff for the 2015 season. Miller joined manager Jose Nieves, pitching coach Tom Browning, and hitting coach Luis Bolivar on the Dragons staff. Miller would also visit other Reds affiliates on select dates in a catching instructor role in 2015. \"We are excited to transition Corky Miller onto our Minor League coaching staff in 2015,\" said Jeff Graupe, Reds Director of Player Development. \"Corky will be based out of Dayton and will split his time working with the Dragons and roving around our system developing our catchers.\n"}

Houlding, the founder of Liverpool F.C., was also the first Chairman of the Everton Burial Board. Everton Cemetery was officially opened on 16 July 1880.\n\nMany of the headstones in Everton Cemetery date back much longer than the opening. Whenever work was undertaken in the city, like widening of roads or dock gates, if this work cut into the city's graveyards, the bodies would be exhumed, and moved to Everton, along with the headstones, and in fact sections of Everton Cemetery contain many of these graves, from the likes of St.Nicholas's, St. George's and St. Anne's to name but a few. \n\nOn 31 August 1898, Liverpool's Necropolis Cemetery (Low Hill/Everton), was closed, due to an edict of the City Council, citing the unsanitary conditions spreading to surrounding neighbourhoods, plus the fact that the cemetery was nearing its full capacity of 80,000 burials. The old headstones were 'dropped' over the graves, and subsequently landscaped in the early 1910s, to make Grant Gardens a public park, which was opened by City Alderman J.R. Grant in 1914.\n\nHeadstones from 'active' private plots at the Necropolis were removed to Everton Cemetery, along with much older headstones and remains from church graveyards within the city boundaries, when public works, such as road-widening or improvements to the riverside docks were undertaken in the early 1900s, which cut into these old burial sites.\n\nThe majority of standing Necropolis Headstones at Everton Cemetery are in the centre of Section GEN6; however, there are a few of these headstones placed in other religious denomination sections of the cemetery. Older 'dropped' headstones and remains, from churches within the city, long gone, are buried in the outer boundary sections of Everton Cemetery (CE32-38).\n\nThe gates to the cemetery, the lodge and the chapel are all Grade II listed buildings.\n\nEverton Cemetery is also described (by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) as Liverpool (Everton) Cemetery.\n\nIn December 1914, Liverpool became one of the 21 Auxiliary Patrol Bases and, in February 1915, the base of the 10th Cruiser Squadron during the First World War. During the Second World War, Liverpool was the headquarters of Western Approaches Command and a manning depot for officers and men of the Merchant Navy who agreed to serve with the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. \n\nLiverpool (Everton) Cemetery contains 55 First World War burials and 15 from the Second World War. There is a small Screen Wall memorial bearing the names of those whose graves are not marked by headstones. During the First World War, almost 700 American servicemen died in Liverpool's military hospitals and most of them were buried in Everton cemetery. Their remains were later removed in 1920 to the American military cemetery at Brookwood, or to the United States. There are 71 identified war casualties at Everton.\n\nThe head of Australian Aborigine warrior Yagan (c.1795–1833), after being kept in Liverpool Museum, was buried in the cemetery in 1964, in a box also containing a Peruvian mummy and a Maori's head that had also been kept by the museum. \n\nAfter lobbying of British and Australian governments by Noongar tribal representatives, the head was exhumed in 1997 (despite a common grave of 22 infant children having been made over it in intervening years) for repatriation and reburial in Belhus, Western Australia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2274780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274780", "title": "Belief bias", "text": "Belief bias\n\nBelief bias is the tendency to judge the strength of arguments based on the plausibility of their conclusion rather than how strongly they support that conclusion. A person is more likely to accept an argument that supports a conclusion that aligns with his values, beliefs and prior knowledge, while rejecting counter arguments to the conclusion. Belief bias is an extremely common and therefore significant form of error; we can easily be blinded by our beliefs and reach the wrong conclusion. Belief bias has been found to influence various reasoning tasks, including conditional reasoning, relation reasoning and transitive reasoning.\n\nA \"syllogism\" is a kind of logical argument in which one proposition (the conclusion) is inferred from two or more others (the \"premises\") of a specific form. The classical example of a valid syllogism is:\n\nAn example of an invalid syllogism is:\n\nTypically, a majority of test subjects in studies incorrectly identify this syllogism as one in which the conclusion follows from the premises. It might be true \"in the real world\" that a) \"girls study\" and b) \"this is because they are ambitious\". However, this argument is a fallacy, because the conclusion is not supported by its premises. The validity of an argument is independent from the truth of its conclusion: there are valid arguments for false conclusions and invalid arguments for true conclusions. Hence, it is an error to judge the validity of an argument from the plausibility of its conclusion. This is the reasoning error known as belief bias.\n\nWhen a person gives a response that is determined by the believability of the conclusion rather than logical validity, this is referred to as belief bias only when a syllogism is used. This phenomenon is so closely related to syllogistic reasoning that, when it does occur, in areas such as Wason's selection task or the THOG problem, it is called \"memory cueing\" or the \"effects of content\".\n\nMany researchers in thinking and reasoning have provided evidence for a dual-process cognitive approach to reasoning, judgment and decision making. They argue that these two mental processes (system 1 and system 2) engage in a constant battle for control over our brain to reason and make decisions. System 1 can be described as an automatic response system characterised by \"unconscious\", \"intuitive\" and \"rapid\" evaluation; whereas system 2 is said to be a controlled response system, characterised by “conscious”, “analytic” and “slow” evaluation; some researchers even claimed to have found a link between general intelligence and the effectiveness of decision making. It is important to note that the dual-process cognitive theory is different from the two minds hypothesis. Research done by Jonathan Evans in 2007 provided evidence for the view that System 1, which serves as a quick heuristic processor, fights for control over System 2's slower analytical approach. In the experiment, participants were asked to evaluate syllogisms that have valid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; valid arguments with convincing conclusions; invalid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; invalid arguments with convincing conclusions. The results show that when the conclusion is believable, people blindly accept invalid conclusions more so than invalid arguments are accepted.\n\nVarious studies have proved that the time period for which a subject is allowed to think when evaluating arguments is related to the tendency for belief bias to take place. In a study done by Evans and Holmes in 2005, they recruited two different groups of people to answer a series of reasoning questions. One group of people were given only two seconds to answer the questions; whereas the other group of people were allowed to use as much time as they would like to answer the questions. The result obtained was that a higher percentage of incorrect answers were found in the time pressured group than the other; they concluded that this was a result of a shift in logical to belief-biased way of thinking.\n\nThe nature of the content presented can also affect belief bias of an individual as shown by a study done by Goel & Vartanian in 2011. In their experiment, 34 participants were presented with a syllogism upon each trial. Each trial were either neutral or carried some degree of negative content. Negative content involved in the experiment were politically incorrect social norm violations, such as the statement “Some wars are not unjustified, Some wars involve raping of women, therefore, Some raping of women is not unjustified”. For syllogisms where the content was neutral, the results were consistent with studies of belief bias; however, for syllogisms with negative emotional content, participants were more likely to reason logically on invalid syllogisms with believable conclusions instead of automatically judging them to be valid. In other words, the effect of belief bias is reduced when the content presented is of negative emotion. According to Goel and Vartanian, this is because negative emotions prompts us to reason in more careful and in more detail. This argument was supported by the observation that for questions with negative emotions, the reaction time taken was significantly longer than that of questions that a neutral.\n\nIn an experiment done by Evans, Newstead, Allen & Pollard in 1994, where subjects were given detailed instructions which lack specific reference to the notion of logical necessity when answering questions, it was shown that a larger proportion of answers actually rejected invalid arguments with convincing conclusions as opposed to when no further instructions were given when the subjects were asked to answer the questions. The results of the experiments reflects that when elaborated instructions were given to subjects to reason logically, the effects of belief bias is decreased.\n\nIn a series of experiments by Evans, Barston and Pollard (1983), participants were presented with evaluation task paradigms, containing two premises and a conclusion. The participants were asked to make an evaluation of logical validity. The subjects, however, exhibited a belief bias, evidenced by their tendency to reject valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions, and endorse invalid arguments with believable conclusions. Instead of following directions and assessing logical validity, the subjects based their assessments on personal beliefs.\n\nConsequently, these results demonstrated a greater acceptance of more believable (80%), than unbelievable (33%) conclusions. Participants also illustrated evidence of logical competences and the results determined an increase in acceptance of valid (73%) than invalid (41%). Additionally, there's a small difference between believable and valid (89%) in comparison to unbelievable and invalid (56%) (Evans, Barston & Pollard, 1983; Morley, Evans & Handley, 2004).\n\nIt has been argued that using more realistic content in syllogisms can facilitate more normative performance from participants. It has been suggested that the use of more abstract, artificial content will also have a biasing effect on performance. Therefore, more research is required to understand fully how and why belief bias occurs and if there are certain mechanisms that are responsible for such things. There is also evidence of clear individual differences in normative responding that are predicted by the response times of participants.\n\nA 1989 study by Markovits and Nantel gave participants four reasoning tasks. The results indicated “a significant belief-bias effect” that existed “independently of the subjects' abstract reasoning ability.”\n\nA 2010 study by Donna Torrens examined differences in belief bias among individuals. Torrens found that “the extent of an individual's belief bias effect was unrelated to a number of measures of reasoning competence” but was, instead, related to that person's ability “to generate alternative representations of premises: the more alternatives a person generated, the less likely they were to show a belief bias effect.\"\n\nIn a 2010 study, Chad Dube and Caren M. Rotello of the University of Massachusetts and Evan Heit of the University of California, Merced, showed that “the belief bias effect is simply a response bias effect.”\n\nIn a 2012 study, Adrian P. Banks of the University of Surrey explained that “belief bias is caused by the believability of a conclusion in working memory which influences its activation level, determining its likelihood of retrieval and therefore its effect on the reasoning process.”\n\nMichelle Colleen and Elizabeth Hilscher of the University of Toronto showed in 2014 that belief bias can be affected by the difficulty level and placement of the syllogism in question.\n\n\n\n"}

During this mission he was sent to explore Lake Aral, but was hindered by the Tartars from reaching the lake. He then employed himself in surveying the south-eastern frontier of Russia, particularly part of the basins of the Kama, Volga, and Jaik. Returning to St. Petersburg in January 1738, he took umbrage at not obtaining promotion and quit the Russian service. In the same year he proposed to some of the British factors at St. Petersburg to carry on a trade through Russia into Iran and central Asia by way of the Caspian Sea. Associating himself with Mungo Graeme, a young Scot, he obtained credit for a small cargo of goods suitable for Khiva and Bokhara. They left Moscow on 19 March 1738-9, and, proceeding down the Volga from Nijni Novgorod to Astrakhan, embarked on the Caspian for Karagansk. At Karagansk they received such unpromising accounts of the state of the steppe that they resolved to continue their voyage to Rasht in Iran. Elton was successful in finding a good market and in obtaining a decree from the shah granting them liberty to trade throughout Iran, and extraordinary privileges. He persuaded the Russia Company to take up his scheme, and in 1741 an Act of Parliament sanctioning the trade was passed. In 1742 two ships were built on the Caspian, and Elton was placed in command of the first completed. These vessels carried the English flag, which, however, Anthony Jenkinson claimed to have first displayed on the Caspian about 1558. The apprehensions of the Russian court were, however, excited by the intelligence that Elton was building ships on the Caspian, after the European fashion, for the Iranian sovereign, Nader Shah. On receipt of the intelligence the Russia Company despatched Jonas Hanway to make inquiry concerning Elton's proceedings. Hanway arrived at Rasht on 3 December 1743 and found Elton earnestly pressing forward the construction of Iranian vessels. The Russian court, indignant at Elton's action, refused to countenance the Caspian trade and ruined the expectations of the Russia Company.\n\nIn the meanwhile Elton had constructed a ship of twenty guns for Nader Shah, of which he was placed in command. He was appointed admiral of the Caspian, and received orders to oblige all Russian vessels on those waters to salute his flag. During his service to Nader, he also twice transported supplies to Baku, and surveyed the southern coast of Dagestan as a preparation for another episode in his Dagestan campaign.\n\nThe Russia Company, in October 1744, vainly ordered him to return to England, Elton replying by the transmission of a decree from Nader Shah, dated 19 November 1745, forbidding him to quit Iran. Offers of a pension from the Russia Company and a post in the navy from the British government were equally ineffectual. Disregarding the injury which he was inflicting on the Russia Company, he maintained that a British subject may with loyalty take service with any foreign potentate on friendly terms with England, and that he was under no obligations to Russia. On the death of Nader in 1747 he narrowly escaped assassination, but found protection from several of the Iranian princes. Finally, however, in April 1751, he espoused the cause of Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar, and was besieged in his house at Gilan by the rival faction. He was subsequently taken prisoner by the governor of Gilan, Hajj Jamal Fumani, for his unwillingness to protect Rasht against the advancing Qajars. He was later shot dead.\n\nA great part of Elton's diary during his first expedition to Iran in 1739 is printed in Jonas Hanway's \"Historical Account of the British Trade over the Caspian Sea\" (1754). Lake Elton in south-eastern Russia is probably named after him.\n\nJohn Elton was the inventor of Elton's quadrant who patented his design in 1728 and published details of the instrument in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1732.\n\n"}
{"id": "2274789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274789", "title": "Taunton High School", "text": "Taunton High School\n\nTaunton High School (often abbreviated THS) is located within a large, three-floor, interconnected, multi-block complex in the eastern section of Taunton, Massachusetts, United States. It is an urban public high school with an estimated average student enrollment of 3,000 students. It offers many student-oriented services, specialty academic programs, extra-curricular clubs, various after-school programs and a wide array of scholastic sports. Taunton High School is one of the largest high schools in New England, and is the 4th largest in Massachusetts, behind Brockton, Lowell, and New Bedford.\n\nThe main section of the building is divided into four different \"houses\" in which different classes are held, along with an associate headmaster’s office in each, and the main headmaster’s office in the middle. One of the houses in the main building complex once contained a public middle school, John F. Parker Middle School, until 2009 where, during a total renovation of the entire school, a fifth, exterior wing was added to the front of the school to house the displaced middle school students. Adjacent to school is the fine arts house, Robert H. Park Auditorium, which currently holds seating capacities up to 1,500 people, and beneath that the music rooms, dressing rooms, and storage. The school also shares a two-leveled gymnasium with Parker Middle School, where most of the indoor sports teams perform and a \"pep rally\" is held in the fall. The school's field house is one of the largest gymnasiums in New England, capable of holding both indoor track meets and basketball tournaments.\n\nTaunton High School is set on a large urban campus containing many buildings including four student academic houses. Each of the four academic houses help to separate the academic departments and are home to their own \"house master\". The campus also features a field house, 10,000 seat football stadium, eight athletics fields, eight tennis courts, cross country trails, 1500-seat capacity multi-level auditorium, two LGI mini-auditoriums, student operated restaurant, TV and radio stations, school store, and a branch of Bristol County Savings Bank.\n\nThe current Taunton High School campus was state of the art for its time when it first opened in 1975, for it featured a modern greenhouse, pool, ice rink, planetarium, a modern public address system with a tone used for class-change signaling (in contrast to standard class-change bells) and telephones, and a high-tech (for 1975) TV studio. The academic houses and class rooms were carpeted from its opening in 1975 through the 2000 school year.\n\nThe requirement for High School level classes in Taunton was established in 1838. The City of Taunton, at that time, did not have a central building in which to hold high school level classes. The local school officials decided to hold high school classes in a neighborhood schoolhouse and rotate each semester to a different location. The first organization of a high school class was held in the District #11 Schoolhouse that later became known as the Woodward School at 52 Worcester Street. The rotation system continued for two years and the state of Massachusetts decided to discontinue the requirement for cities and towns to offer high school classes. From 1840 to 1848, there were no high school classes offered in Taunton. In 1849, Massachusetts, once again, required cities and towns to establish high school classes. The leaders of Taunton decided to hold high school classes in the basement of a church on Spring Street known as the Winslow Church. The classes continued at that location until local officials expanded the interior of the City Hall. The high School classes were moved to the second floor of Taunton City Hall in the mid-1850s and remained there until 1885 when a new High School was built on Washington Street on the site of a popular picnic grounds called 'King's Grove'.\nThe Taunton High School on Washington Street received numerous additions as well as a face lift over the years. The building was in need of replacement and city officials purchased the Baylies estate on Williams Street to construct a new and current Taunton High School complex in 1975.\n\nTaunton High School underwent a $112 million renovation. The John F. Parker Middle School was removed from the High School and a new wing was constructed that houses the operations of the John F. Parker Middle School. The renovation was handled by the firm of Bacon & Agostini.\n\nFrom Bacon & Agostini\n\nThe project consists of renovations to the existing 496,503SF three-story high school and middle school building and a new 62,365SF three-story middle school addition, as well as site, utility and road work.\n\nThis is a phase project in which the existing building will continue to be occupied during construction. The schedule is aggressive, especially during the summers and coordination will be complicated. The final completion was finished in August 2011.\n\"(EMass Division 1, Hockomock League, Kelley-Rex Division)\"\nSports:\n\n\n\n\n"}

A Democrat, Jennings served five terms over 20 years.\n\nGerald Jennings often goes by the name Jerry. Born in North Albany he began his career in the Albany City School District after graduating with a bachelor's degree from SUNY Brockport in 1970 and a Master of Science degree from the University at Albany in 1976. He served for 13 years on the Albany Common Council representing the 11th Ward.\n\nJennings won an upset in the 1993 Democratic mayoral primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic city—over Harold Joyce, who had the Democratic Party’s formal endorsement and had only recently been its chairman. In 1993, he won the general election, becoming the 74th mayor of Albany.\n\nIn a break from his party, Jennings endorsed George Pataki, a Republican, in the 2002 New York gubernatorial race. The mayor has also supported now-former U.S. Representative John E. Sweeney (R-Clifton Park). Jennings has been a strong proponent of the plan to build a convention center in downtown Albany. He hosts a call-in radio show on WGDJ every Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. He did not run for reelection and retired as mayor in 2013.\n\nJennings is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan group with a stated goal of \"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.\" The Coalition was co-chaired by former Boston mayor Tom Menino and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Beginning in 2002, the Albany Police Department endured a scandal regarding illicitly purchased machine guns.\n\nIn November 2008, local media reported that for 15 years the Albany Police Department has engaged in an unapproved effort to avoid parking fines. It was alleged that an unofficial, secret system resulted in \"zero fine\" tickets being issued to an unknown number of local drivers who either had special windshield decals or were on VIP lists. Both the New York State Comptroller's Office and the Albany Common Council investigated the practice, and the Albany Times Union made a request under the Freedom of Information Law to obtain more information about it. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli's audit faulted the city for \"lax oversight that allowed at least two informal systems for skirting parking fines to flourish.\" In November 2009, Jennings denied that he knew of any abuses in regard to parking tickets, and also directed that the issuance of no-fine tickets be ceased.\n\nAlbany has a strong-mayor form of government in which the city legislature (the Common Council) can vote on the budget, but a two-thirds majority is needed to override any disagreement with the Mayor. Albany's 2008 budget of $161.8 million was criticized for significant borrowing from reserves to bring it into balance. In 2007, the Common Council voted 9-6 to support the mayor's budget, although no cost-cutting measures were proposed or adopted.\n\nIn the 2006 primary, Jennings was voted out of his position on the New York State Democratic Committee by state Assemblyman John McEneny. The mayor had served on the committee since 2002. This race was a rematch of the 1997 primary, when McEneny unsuccessfully challenged Jennings for the Democratic mayoral nomination.\n\nThe Albany \"Times Union\" reported on November 25, 2008, that the mayor would seek re-election for a fifth term in 2009. The story noted that \"Safety in the city, with its youth violence and gun crimes, continues to mar Jennings' leadership and Albany's image.\" Jennings' opponent for the Democratic primary, Albany Common Council member Corey Ellis, announced his candidacy on March 2, 2009. (Common Council President Shawn Morris was originally also a candidate, but she dropped out over the summer.) Jennings won the primary, held on September 15, 2009, and went on to defeat Republican Nathan Lebron on November 3 in the general election.\n\n2005 election for Mayor of Albany\n2006 election for New York State Democratic Committee \n\n2009 Democratic Primary for Mayor of Albany\n\n2009 election for Mayor of Albany.\n\n\n"}

Here Comes the Pain (Known as Exciting Pro Wrestling 5 in Japan) is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and published by THQ for PlayStation 2. It is the sequel to \"WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth\", released in October 2003, and is part of the \"WWE SmackDown!\" series based on World Wrestling Entertainment's weekly TV show SmackDown. It was the first \"SmackDown!\" game to feature a catchphrase not linked back to The Rock in its title. It was also the final WWE game to solely use the \"SmackDown!\" name, as it was succeeded by \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw\" series in November 2004.\n\nAlongside a new grappling system, body damage displays and submission meters (for both the person applying the move and the person breaking out of the move), as well as the ability to break the submission hold when touching the ropes, and individual character scales that consisted of statistics (such as strength, endurance and speed) were all introduced for the first time. \"Here Comes the Pain\" also marks the first time the Elimination Chamber and the Bra and Panties Match would be featured in a wrestling game.\n\nAlongside a playable roster of over 50 Superstars who were active members of the WWE roster at the time of the game's release, legends were introduced for the first time, which included retired wrestlers like Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka and \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, as well as former iterations of current wrestlers, such as The Undertaker with his 1990s gimmick. It also marks the final time that The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin would appear in a WWE game as non-legends, and is the first WWE game to feature future mainstays John Cena, Batista, and Rey Mysterio as playable characters. It is also the first game to depict Kane without his mask. It is also known for being the only WWE game to feature Ultimo Dragon, who despite huge popularity in Japan and Mexico otherwise only appeared in WCW games.\n\nAdditional updates came in Season Mode, with decisions (such as where you wanted to go and what you wanted to do next) being made on a new menu screen in your locker room, while players could enter the General Manager's room to ask for title shots and brand switches. There are multiple titles to go after depending on if you go to \"SmackDown!\" or \"RAW\".\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics and \"universal acclaim\" from fans and gamers alike. With parts of the wrestling fanbase considering \"Here Comes The Pain\" to be one of the greatest wrestling video games of all time.\n\nThe development version featured Jeff Hardy, Hulk Hogan (along with his alter-ego Mr. America and his 1980s appearance) and The Ultimate Warrior. Hogan and Hardy were removed from the game when they left WWE and Warrior was omitted due to a legal dispute with the company. Data for other omitted wrestlers, including Al Snow, Spike Dudley, Billy Kidman, Billy Gunn, William Regal, Bradshaw, Molly Holly and 3-Minute Warning remains on the final discs, with none of them having any finished character models. The concept of having multiple versions of Hogan in one game was finally included with the release of \"WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006\". Chief Morley was originally planned for the game, but was changed last minute to Val Venis.\n\n\"WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain\" received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics and “universal acclaim” from fans and gamers alike, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nIGN called the game \"one of the best wrestling games we've ever played...With its ultra-improved gameplay mechanics, enhanced visual engine, smarter career mode, and established create-a-character feature, Yuke's and THQ are definitely the track to success.\" GameSpot said, \"What the game lacks in innovation, however, is more than made up for in sheer playability.\" Eurogamer called it \"a superb blend of traditional and wrestling-specific fight mechanics, and there's so much variety here that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say you could play this one from now until the next SmackDown without getting bored or running out of things to do.\" \"GMR\" said, \"Submission moves finally makes [sic] sense, thanks to a logical location-based damage system, and wrestlers' weights are accurately presented.\"\n\nOther reviews were more mixed. \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" called it \"the first game in the series that tries to accommodate both sides by combining quick action with the technical elements of wrestling, and it works -- almost.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 29 out of 40.\n\n\n"}

Ethnos360 has approximately 3,300 missionaries in more than 20 nations.\n\nEthnos360 sends missionaries from local churches around the world to Latin America, West Africa, Southeast Asia and the Arctic. Countries include Brazil, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Greenland, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mexico, Mozambique, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Philippines, Senegal, Tanzania, Thailand and formerly Venezuela. New Tribes Mission is also a member of the Forum of Bible Agencies International.\n\nThe mission's focus is on groups where no translation of the Bible exists. When such a group is identified, Ethnos360 first attempts to make contact and establish a relationship. Then, missionaries are sent to learn the language and the culture of the native people, while further developing relationships and providing humanitarian aid. The missionaries translate biblical literature into the indigenous language, as well as teach natives how to read and write in their own language. The professed goal, however, is to establish fully functioning churches that operate independently of missionaries, which \"in turn reach out to their own people and to neighboring tribes\".\n\nThe core belief of Ethnos360 is \"Sola Scriptura,\" accompanied by a historical-grammatical hermeneutic in interpreting the scriptures. This emphasis on \"word by word inspiration\" leads to literal belief \"in the fall of man resulting in his complete and universal separation from God and his need of salvation\". Those who die unsaved go to \"unending punishment\" (hence the mandate to evangelize those without access to the gospel). Additionally, Etnos360 is a dispensational organization, subscribing to the \"imminent... pretribulation and pre-millennial return\" of Jesus Christ to earth.\n\nNTM was founded by Paul Fleming, from Los Angeles, in 1942. In the 1930s Fleming had worked as a missionary in the British colony of Malaya. Initially, NTM was based in a former nightclub in Chicago.\n\nIn 1943 NTM started publishing its magazine \"Brown Gold\". In 1944/45, NTM moved headquarters to Chico, California. Shortly thereafter it established a \"boot camp\" (missionary training facility) at Fouts Springs, California.\n\nThe organization sent out its first group in November 1942 to Bolivia. On January 12, 1944 the startling news came back that five of the men were missing. These five men had been killed, however the facts were not revealed until years later. Ethnos360's first five missionaries were killed by the Ayoreo Indians in Bolivia. According to Time Magazine, five NTM missionaries were killed by aboriginal Bolivians in 1943.\n\nIn June 1950 the first plane bought by NTM crashed in Venezuela, killing all 15 people on board. The second plane bought by NTM crashed in November the same year at Mount Moran in Grand Teton National Park USA while on its way to bring missionaries abroad, killing all 21 aboard, including spouses, several children and founder Paul Fleming.\n\nIn July 1953, 14 NTM members serving as volunteer firefighters died in what became known as the Rattlesnake Fire about 25 miles north of Fouts Springs, California in the Mendocino National Forest.\n\nIn the late 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, a number of New Tribes Mission personnel have been killed by guerrillas in different parts of the world.\n\n\nEthnos360 requires all candidates to complete a training program. The training program can take up to four years to complete. In the US, this training culminates in an unaccredited bachelor's degree. Major Bible colleges such as Moody Bible Institute and Columbia International University recognize credits and degrees from Ethnos360.\n\nThe first phase of the training consists of basic Bible education. This phase lasts two years. In the US, this training takes place at one of two different Bible schools, one in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and the other in Jackson, Michigan. These schools are collectively called the New Tribes Bible Institute. This portion of the training program is often waived for candidates possessing previous Bible training from accredited Bible colleges.\n\nThe second phase of the program involves extensive study in cross-cultural communication, church planting, and linguistic analysis. It also lasts two years as candidates study advanced linguistic techniques, learning how to alphabetize unwritten languages and translate the Bible. Formerly called \"Boot Camp,\" this phase also emphasizes basic living skills necessary for survival in undeveloped areas of the world (e.g. constructing and cooking from clay stoves, building jungle shelters, etc.). In the US, this takes place at the Etnos360 Missionary Training Center in Camdenton, Missouri.\n\nAn NTM Canadian training center exists in Durham, Ontario. Similar training programs exist in other countries, including Brazil, Germany, Mexico and United Kingdom.\n\nNew Tribes Mission's strategy for \"church planting\" starts with language acquisition. NTM believes that individuals should have access to the Bible and its teachings in their native languages and refuses to teach in English or local trade languages. Several unwritten languages on the verge of extinction have been given new leases of life, because of missionary efforts to reduce them to writing and to teach their speakers in literacy.\n\nAfter becoming proficient in the local languages, NTM missionaries initiate in-depth Bible studies with interested parties. Rather than distributing tracts or showing the \"Jesus\" film (popular methods among many organizations), NTM focuses on teaching through the Scriptures chronologically. Missionaries begin with the Genesis account of creation and follow the storyline of the Bible through to the story of Jesus Christ and the teachings of the New Testament. This approach is necessary because most of the cultures in which they work have no exposure to any biblical teaching whatsoever, and therefore require solid grounding on the foundational principles of the Old Testament before they can be introduced to the New Testament Gospel.\n\nThis chronological curriculum consists of 50 lessons and is called \"Building on Firm Foundations\". It was written by Trevor McIlwain and Nancy Everson and originally published in 1985.\n\nEthnos360 is listed by Ministry Watch on the Shining Lights 'Top 30' Exemplary Ministries. MinistryWatch.com, in response to requests for a list of Christian ministries that are among the best to which donors can give with confidence, has released a \"Top 30\" list of ministries as the latest MinistryWatch.com Shining Light profile. Ethnos360 is one of those Top 30 Shining Lights.\n\nCritics contend that the New Tribes Mission and other evangelist groups \"hunt down primitive Indians and destroy their culture in the name of converting them to Christianity\". Paul Gifford, Professor of Religion at the University of London, accused NTM of changing indigenous cultures and representing US foreign policy interests in countries where they were active. Due to such claims, in 1989, NTM was investigated, and subsequently cleared, of any wrongdoing by the all-party Parliamentary Human Rights Committee in Britain. However, a letter of protest signed by Bishop Trevor Huddleston, Lord Avebury, Chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group; Rabbi Richard Rosen; and Survival International President Robin Hanbury-Tenison, called on the Mission to halt its controversial activities and respect tribal religion and culture. According to Stephen Corry, Director of Survival International, some missionaries do an enormous amount of work to help indigenous peoples and defend their rights, while others do great harm. He says he is not anti-missionary and that he himself and his organization have worked together with countless missionaries. He recalls how a senior member of a very large mission organisation personally told him that their critiques published in the 1970s had stimulated change for the better within his organisation.\n\nMembers of the Ayoreo Totobiegosode tribe, were forced into trucks and driven to a camp set up by NTM where they endured years of unpaid servitude, leading to numerous deaths from diseases introduced by the missionaries. The director of the mission, Fred Sammons, responded to these allegations with the claim that \"The Indians live in fear, in fear of evil spirits and in fear of violent death because it's in their culture to kill. But when they come with us, they accept a new way of life... We never force our religion on anyone.\" Mr. Sammons also wrote <nowiki>\"There are people who like to say that the Ayoreos are happy living in the jungle... Yet if you ask anyone who has had a taste of civilization if he wants to go back and live like he used to, the answer is always a very positive 'No'. \"</nowiki> Former Paraguayan minister of culture Ticio Escobar claimed that Ayoreos who were brought out of their isolation exhibited \"all of the side effects of losing one's cultural identity: alcoholism, social disorganisation, apathy, violence, suicide, prostitution, and marginalization\".\n\nIn 1981, in what is now the Río Puré National Park in Colombia, NTM missionaries interacted with the previously uncontacted Nukak people. Gift-giving led the Nukak to seek contact with settlers nearby. Combined with encroachment from guerrilla groups and cocoa growers, these later interactions with the outside world resulted in cultural instability and disease. Many members of the tribe now receive government subsidies in San José del Guaviare.\n\nIn October 2005, the BBC reported that Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez had announced his intention to expel New Tribes Mission from Venezuela. He accused New Tribes Mission of imperialism, of collaborating with the US CIA, of violating Venezuela's national sovereignty, and of violating the country's laws by making unauthorized flights into and out of the country. He also attacked the group for building lavish camps in which to live next to poverty-stricken villages.\n\nResponding to the allegations, NTM said, \"Any kind of air travel we do, we always do within the guidelines of what the government allows. We always file reports.\" With respect to \"luxury\" living, they \"live in homes that make it possible for them to continue the work that they do. The homes that they live in are very simple.\"\n\nOn November 3, 2005, hundreds of Venezuelan indigenous people marched in Puerto Ayacucho protesting against the expulsion of NTM by the Venezuelan government. Although the Venezuelan constitution recognized their collective ownership of ancestral lands in 1999, \"poverty remains acute among many Indian communities and many protesters said the missionaries were the only people who have tangibly improved their lives.\"\n\nA 2010 report by G.R.A.C.E.(Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment), an organization dedicated to helping Christian organizations deal with abuse, documented reports of sexual, physical, emotional abuse at the Fanda boarding school operated by NTM for the children of NTM workers in the country of Senegal during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDavid Brooks, a dorm parent at the Fanda Boarding School (Sengal) in the mid-1980s, sexually molested multiple girls, including Kari Mikitson and Bonnie Cheshire. He was identified as the school's most prolific perpetrator of sexual abuse, preying on one girl alone more than 50 times. Kari and Bonnie started, in 2009, a blog with the mission to create a network for abuse survivors and pressure New Tribes into addressing the allegations. On the blog, many people who had attended New Tribes boarding schools around the world detailed their own stories of sexual abuse, including reports from additional countries. As more stories emerged, New Tribes Mission requested Mikitson to come to its headquarters in Sanford, Florida, for a face-to-face meeting with board members. Kari requested a G.R.A.C.E. investigation. The report identified seven alleged perpetrators by name and outlined the acts the perpetrators carried out. Additionally, the report mentioned David Brooks telling the abused, \"He told these children not to tell, because bad things would happen and no one would believe them.\" According to 1992 New Tribe field committee notes obtained by the Grace investigators, the group did have a policy on child sexual abuse that expressly stated allegations should not be reported to police and outlined guidelines for different kinds of acts:\n\n\"If it is a homosexual act with a child, the person will be dismissed immediately and may never be considered for membership in the mission again. If it is a heterosexual act the person will be dismissed immediately but could be considered for ministry again in the future depending on the case. If it occurs in the field, it is not necessary to report it to the Senegalese or U.S. authorities. It must be investigated as not doing so could be ruinous for the mission.\"\n\nHowever even if New Tribes Mission were to report the perpetrators, there was little that law enforcement could do. It wasn't until Congress passed the Protect Act in 2003 that the U.S. government could prosecute Americans for sex crimes committed overseas without going through the onerous and often impossible task of proving the suspect had traveled to that country for the purpose of abusing kids. \n\n\n\n\n"}

The spread of the moths as an invasive species has resulted in the destruction of millions of hardwood trees throughout the eastern United States.\n\nTrouvelot was born at Aisne, France. During his early years he was apparently involved in politics and had republican leanings. Following a coup d'état by Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte in 1851, he fled with his family to the United States. They settled in the town of Medford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, at the address of 27 Myrtle St. There he supported himself and his family as an artist and astronomer.\n\nTrouvelot had an interest as an amateur entomologist. In the U.S., silk-producing moths were being killed off by various diseases. Trouvelot was very interested in Lepidoptera larvae including native North American silk moths which he believed could potentially be used for silk production. For reasons that remain unknown, Trouvelot brought some gypsy moth egg masses from Europe in the mid-1860s and was raising gypsy moth larvae in the forest behind his house. Unfortunately, some of the larvae escaped into the nearby woods. There are conflicting reports on the resulting actions. One states that despite issuing oral and written warnings of possible consequences, no officials were willing to assist in searching out and destroying the moths. The other notes that he was aware of the risk and there is no direct evidence that he contacted government officials.\n\nShortly following this incident, Trouvelot lost interest in entomology and turned again to astronomy. In this field he could put his skills as an artist to good use by illustrating his observations. His interest in astronomy was apparently aroused in 1870 when he witnessed several auroras.\n\nWhen Joseph Winlock, the director of Harvard College Observatory, saw the quality of his illustrations, he invited Trouvelot to join the staff there in 1872. In 1875, he was invited to use the U. S. Naval Observatory to use the 26-inch refractor for a year. During the course of his life he produced about 7,000 quality astronomical illustrations. Fifteen of his most superb pastel illustrations were published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1881. He was particularly interested in the Sun, and discovered \"veiled spots\" in 1875. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1877.\n\nBesides his illustrations, he published about 50 scientific papers.\n\nBy 1882, Trouvelot had returned to France and joined the Meudon Observatory where he worked with photography and became engaged in a bitter rivalry with his boss, the astronomer Jules Janssen. This was a few years before the magnitude of the problem caused by his gypsy moth release became apparent to the local government of Massachusetts. He died in Meudon, France. The gypsy moth was considered a serious pest and attempts were underway to eradicate it (ultimately these were unsuccessful). To this date, the gypsy moth continues to expand its range in the United States, and together with other foliage-eating pests, cause an estimated $868 million in annual damages.\n\n\nGypsy moths in the United States\nCamille Flammarion\n\n"}

The ecclesiastical province comprises the suffragan dioceses of Bydgoszcz and Włocławek.\n\nThe Metropolitan Archdiocese of Gniezno was established in 1000 AD on the initiative of the Polish duke Bolesław I the Brave. He had the relics of the missionary and martyr Adalbert of Prague (\"Wojciech\") transferred to Gniezno Cathedral, which soon became a major pilgrimage site. Here Bolesław met with Emperor Otto III in the Congress of Gniezno, where the duke obtained investiture rights and created the Gniezno archbishopric, superseding the older Diocese of Poznań. Led by Adalbert's half-brother Radim Gaudentius, the ecclesiastical province then comprised the suffragan dioceses in Kraków, Wrocław, and Kołobrzeg (extinct in 1015), and from about 1075 also Poznań.\n\nThe position of the archbishops and their suffragans was confirmed in the 1136 Bull of Gniezno issued by Pope Innocent II.

Jay Stewart announced for the first six weeks, after which Bob Hilton became the permanent announcer.\n\nThe game changed format several times over its short run, but all forms involved some variation on asking questions with percentage answers or statistics.\n\nTwo married couples competed. One contestant from each couple was asked to estimate what percentage of 300 people answered a specific question correctly. Whoever was closest to the actual percentage, high or low, scored the actual percentage points. If both contestants guessed the same percentage, either contestant was given the option to change their estimate.\n\nThe contestant who scored the points could then either answer the question (without conferring with his or her spouse) or challenge his or her opponent to answer. A right answer or a successful challenge added the remaining percentage points to the couple's score. For example, if 53% answered the question correctly, a team earned 53 points for the closer guess and could earn an additional 47 points from a correct answer to the question or a successful challenge.\n\nIf the contestant with the initial control missed the question, the opponent could steal the points. Originally, a successful challenge also allowed the contestant to answer the question for the same number of points. The first couple to reach 300 points won the game and $300.\n\nOriginally, if a team guessed the percentage exactly right, they won the game automatically. A week later, in addition to winning the game, the team won a cash jackpot that started at $10,000 and increased by $1,000 for every game in which it went unclaimed. Any couple who won five consecutive games received a new car.\n\nOn March 3, 1980, the format was overhauled. Two individual contestants, one a returning champion, competed in a straight quiz. Three categories were in play in each game. Two of the categories were selected by the players before the game, with each player selecting one that they felt they knew the most about. The third category consisted of random general knowledge questions and was called Potluck.\n\nA round started with a category being determined by a randomizer, and two questions were asked in that category. The challenger chose a value from ten to ninety points in ten point increments for the first question with the points based on the percentage of the people surveyed who answered the question incorrectly, rounded to the nearest zero. Answering correctly earned the challenger the points, but the champion could steal them if the challenger did not answer correctly. The second question was played the same way, but with the champion determining the value.\n\nIf one of the two preselected categories was chosen, both questions would be asked in turn. If Potluck was chosen, both questions were toss-ups and could be answered by either player by buzzing in. Later, every question became a toss-up.\n\nThe first contestant to reach 250 points won the game, $500, and advanced to the bonus round. If there was no winner after five rounds, a final toss-up question decided the winner (the player who is in the lead getting to choose the category), who then advanced to the bonus round. Any contestant who won five consecutive games won a new car.\n\nThe couple gave a target percentage that was larger than zero. The host read a question and three possible answers. One answer (usually the correct one) was the most popular and awarded the most points. Another choice was a less popular answer, and the third answer received no response and scored zero points. The couple chose an answer and scored points based on the percentage of the poll that also gave that response.\n\nIf the couple chose an answer which scored 0%, the bonus round ended immediately. The couple could also choose to end the bonus round at any time and take $10 per point earned. However, if a couple accumulated 100 points or more, the couple won $2,500. Also, if a couple chose an answer with a percentage that matched exactly the percentage stated at the start of the bonus round, the couple won a cash jackpot that started at $25,000 and increased by $1,000 each day.\n\nStarting the week of January 14, the format was changed to remove the jackpot. Also, if a couple chose the second-most popular response to a question, they were then required to choose the most-popular answer from the remaining two choices available before moving to the next question.\n\nA single question was presented with a list six of possible answers. Five of the answers were given by the survey respondents, and one answer was not given. Contestants chose answers one-at-a-time, winning $10 per point or $2,500 for guessing all five actual responses and avoiding the answer with 0%. As before, selecting the answer with 0% ended the game and forfeited all bonus winnings up to that point. The $2,500 cash prize was later replaced with a prize package worth between $3,000 and $3,500.\n\nWhen the format changed from couples to individual contestants, the champion was permitted to bring a spouse, other relative or friend onstage, but only for moral support—the champion was the only person who selected answers. (The supporter was permitted to suggest answers, but it was the champion's decision.)\n\nTo ensure that the percentage points in this format always added up to 100%, the points awarded were based on the percentage of the people who responded with that answer \"in relation to\" the five most popular answers of that survey, not the actual number of people who gave that answer.\n\nFrom February 18 until the program's cancellation, the same prize package was at stake for the entire show until won.\n\nUSA Network reran the series from April 27, 1987, to June 23, 1989. Game Show Network has aired episodes sporadically over the years.\n"}

The basic idea of a MoSoSo is to overlay a location and time element to the idea of digital networking. It enables users to find one another, in a particular vicinity and time, for social or business networking.\n\nThe term itself has its roots in social software and Groupware, computer applications designed for the desktop environment and aiming at facilitating various forms of social interaction, with the former being oriented to Internet-based informal exchanges, daily tasks and entertainment and the latter focusing on collaborative work (CSCW) or learning (CSCL) within a well defined group. Two typical groups that would benefit from these applications are or school classmates. While the term social software, introduced by Clay Shirky in recent years, has gained much popularity, Groupware is not anymore a trendy word, even if it has a strong tradition that goes back to the Eighties. Scientific research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) provides results which are still valid in the mobile environment. However, three important differences between desktop and mobile environments should be taken into account when conducting research on MoSoSo: firstly, the physical context of use moves from static desktop setting, where the user is typically sitting in front of his computer, to the more dynamic mobile context, which presents higher constraints to human attention, but also provides an opportunity for information or communication at any time and anywhere. Secondly, the social context becomes wider, shifting from the group to the network concept. Rather than relying on static and known membership criteria, where group members usually know each other, social network ties change often and are not as dense as in traditional groups. Therefore, network boundaries cannot be easily identified. A mobile social network is the social space determined by a MoSoSo application. Finally, an important distinction concerns the ultimate goal of MoSoSo applications, designed for usage in everyday life situations, including not only tools for communication, but also for coordination and knowledge sharing. From this perspective, MoSoSo is more similar to social software than Groupware applications, which aimed at increasing productivity and teamwork at work or at school.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, MoSoSo applications are very connected to the concept of Mobile Internet and the emphasis is more on data sharing than mere communication. Thus, only mobile phones with computational power, or Smartphones, can host this kind of applications. However, as there is not a universal definition of MoSoSo yet, many people consider as MoSoSo also phone calls and text messages, as they support social interaction on the move. In any case, the former perspective encounters wider consensus than the latter. The development of MoSoSo applications is rapid and already evolved from mobile extensions of Internet social networking sites to powerful software, providing novel opportunities for social interaction, especially when used for proximity interactions based on Bluetooth scanning and connectivity. The availability of GPS systems and the integration of maps in mobile devices offer great opportunities not only in the context of individual activities, such as \"search\", but especially in the social context. MoSoSo exploiting these possibilities is known as LBS-MoSoSo.\n\nIn one of the few critical studies on MoSoSo, Thom-Santelli (2007) argued that the real potential of MoSoSo was constrained by its limited conceptualization, and consequently implementation, as an urban entertainment gadget. Building on her argument, Lugano (2010) re-conceptualized MoSoSo as a general-purpose social platform for grassroots social change and proposed a holistic design model for empowering self-organizing digital communities to co-create, share and use community-generated services (CGS).

{"id": "2274936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274936", "title": "WOGL", "text": "WOGL\n\nWOGL (98.1 FM, \"98.1 WOGL\") is a commercial FM radio station licensed to serve Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by Entercom and broadcasts a classic hits radio format. The broadcast tower used by the station is located in the Roxborough section of the city at (). Studios and offices are on East City Avenue in Bala Cynwyd.\n\nWOGL uses HD Radio, and broadcasts a '70s music format on its HD2 subchannel. The talk radio programming of sister station WPHT is simulcast on its HD3 subchannel, while the programming on its HD4 subchannel is all Philadelphia Phillies baseball.\n\nStarting in 2018, the station no longer plays Christmas music during the Holiday season now that the parent company, Entercom owns an Adult Contemporary station, WBEB \"\"B101.1\"\" in the market to take care of the Holiday music.\n\nOn January 13, 1942, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the William Penn Broadcasting Company a construction permit for a new FM station on 47.3 MHz on the original 42-50 MHz FM broadcast band, with the call sign W73PH. Beginning the next month the station was issued a series of special authorizations to operate commercially with a temporary antenna, followed by its first full license on March 2, 1943.\n\nWilliam Penn Broadcasting also operated AM station WPEN (now WKDN) in Philadelphia, and on November 1, 1943 W73PH was assigned the WPEN-FM call sign. After the FCC created the current FM broadcast band on June 27, 1945, William Penn Broadcasting applied to the FCC for a construction permit on January 21, 1946 to install a new transmitter and antenna for operation on 99.5 MHz, and the FCC approved this application on October 24, 1946.\n\nThe station's license and construction permit were voluntarily assigned to the Philadelphia Record Company, owners of AM station WCAU (now WPHT) in Philadelphia, on November 28, 1947. This was effective December 18, 1947, and the station's call sign was changed to WCAU-FM the same day. On December 23, 1947, the FCC reassigned the station to 98.1 MHz, modifying the construction permit. The FCC granted a licensee name change from Philadelphia Record Company to WCAU, Inc. on March 3, 1948. The commission granted WCAU, Inc. a new license for the station for operation on 98.1 MHz on September 27, 1949.\n\nOn December 4, 1953, the FCC granted WCAU, Inc. a construction permit to relocate the station's transmitter and antenna to the Roxborough section of Philadelphia. The station's license was renewed by the FCC with the new facilities on October 19, 1954. The FCC granted a voluntary assignment of the station's license to Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. on July 23, 1958.\n\nUntil 1966, WCAU-FM simulcast the Middle of The Road music heard on AM 1210 WCAU. Along with other CBS FM stations, WCAU-FM began airing \"The Young Sound,\" a prerecorded format of instrumental easy listening songs based on contemporary hits.\n\nIn the fall of 1970, WCAU-FM replaced \"The Young Sound\" with an automated oldies format. For prerecorded announcements, the station used the voice of Jim Nettleton, a disc jockey on top-rated WABC in New York City. Prior to working for 77WABC in New York, Jim Nettleton was a very popular DJ on Famous 56 WFIL in Philadelphia from 1966 to 1969 before he was heard on WABC in late 1969 in New York. Live air personalities were eventually heard, with Nettleton moving from New York to host middays. The station played the hits from 1955 up to and including some current product.\n\nAt the end of 1975, the oldies format was replaced by disco music, a hot trend at the time. As disco cooled, the station called its format \"Fascinatin' Rhythm.\" When the 1970s came to a close, the music became more diversified with the addition of jazz, pop and R&B. The station experimented briefly with a format called \"Mellow Rhythm\" at this time, hosted primarily by Dr. Perri Johnson (now a music therapist in Los Angeles).\n\nProgram consultant Mike Joseph was brought into WCAU-FM in April 1981 to develop a new format to replace the struggling \"Mellow Rhythm.\" Joseph recommended that the station go Top 40. On September 22, 1981, at Midnight, the new format at WCAU-FM debuted: an all-current-hits, high-energy, jingle-intensive Top 40 sound dubbed \"Hot Hits.\" Joseph first put Hot Hits on the air in 1977 at WTIC-FM in Hartford, Connecticut, with a significant increase in ratings. Joseph called the station \"98 Now.\" WCAU-FM's ratings showed an immediate improvement, and subsequently, FM stations in major radio markets such as Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and San Francisco picked up the \"Hot Hits\" format.\n\nWCAU-FM found a great deal of success with this programming for much of the mid-1980s, although the original \"Fusion\" jingles from TM were dropped in the summer of 1982 and replaced with a package from JAM to increase appeal to older listeners. Some notable DJs on the station in this period included Paul Barsky, Rich Hawkins, Billy Burke, Terry Young and Christy Springfield.\n\nIn 1987, WCAU-FM found itself with stiff competition in the CHR/Top 40 format from WEGX, \"Eagle 106.\" CBS decided that WCAU-FM could be more profitable appealing to an older, more desirable demographic of 25-to 54-year-olds. On November 9, 1987, at 7 p.m., after playing \"Another One Bites the Dust\" by Queen, WCAU-FM returned to the oldies format as WOGL (which stood for \"Old Gold\"). The first song on WOGL was \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\" by Little Richard. Eleven hours later, however, 102.1 WIOQ shifted to oldies as well. WOGL had a deep playlist, playing a larger number of songs than most oldies stations. For the next year, the WOGL and WIOQ competed for Philadelphia's FM oldies audience, until WIOQ dropped the format early in 1989. Scott Walker, who programmed Hot Hits WCAU-FM, remained as Program Director.\n\nOriginally, WOGL was known as \"Oldies 98.\" By 1992, WOGL incorporated more soul oldies. The station still played artists such as Elvis, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, but in addition, it focused on soul, including Philadelphia-only hits. The mix was about 2/3 R&B and 1/3 rock and pop. The rock and pop songs played were the big hits typically heard on oldies stations. But WOGL also capitalized on Philadelphia's love of R&B. WOGL played about 15% 1950s, 15% early 1960s, 55% mid-to-late 1960s, 13% 1970s, and 2% 1980s.\n\nWOGL aired specialty shows such as the \"Hot Lunch Special\" request show, \"The Weeknight Hall Of Fame,\" \"Top 20 Oldies Countdown,\" \"Elvis & Friends,\" \"The Saturday Night Dance Party,\" \"Brunch With The Beatles,\" and \"Street Corner Sunday\" (a Doo Wop music program). In 2001, all the specialty shows were purged. The playlist was moved away from soul and Philadelphia-only hits (though a few remained), and moved towards a more traditional playlist as found on other oldies stations. The music was about 70% 1960s, 10% 1950s, 15% 1970s, and 5% 1980s. Scott Walker left the station in 2001.\n\nBy 2002, some of the specialty shows were brought back. A modified version of \"Street Corner Sunday\" was heard. While it was strictly doo wop in its previous incarnation, it was updated to play all types of pre-1964 oldies. More 1970s music was added and even some 1980s tracks were heard. In 2003, the name \"Oldies 98\" was downplayed and the station became known as \"Motown Soul Rock & Roll: 98.1 WOGL\". At that point, the station cut to one 1950s song per hour and one pre-'64 song per hour. It also played a couple of 1980s songs per hour. The rest of the music was roughly 50% mid and late 1960s and 50% 1970s music. In 2004, the playlist was tightened to about half 1960s and half 1970s. Their slogan also changed to \"Greatest Hits of the '60s and '70s.\" In late 2007 and early 2008, more 1980s music was added to the rotation, and effective July 6, 2008, WOGL's slogan was changed to \"The Greatest Hits of the 60s, 70s and 80's,\" which is also used on sister station WCBS-FM when it returned to an Oldies/Classic Hits format in July 2007.\n\nIn late 2016, morning co-host Valerie Knight was fired after 14 years with the station. \n\nAs of 2018, WOGL no longer plays any music from the 1960s and is mostly focused on songs from the 1980s, with a moderate amount of 1970s and a few 1990s hits.\n\nOn January 21, 2018, \"Street Corner Sunday\" was discontinued after 29 years in favor of regular programming.\n\nFrom the late 1980s through the early 1990s, WOGL used jingles from Frank Gari Productions, Otis Connor, and TM Studios. From the mid-1990s through the early 2000s, the station used the Do It Again jingle package by JAM Creative Productions and the Super Hits package by Tony Griffin, both of which were also used by sister station WCBS-FM. From 2003-2017, the station used jingles from a variety of different JAM packages, most of which were resings of 1970s-80s top 40 station jingles. Since late 2017, the station has been using jingles from Reelworld Productions. \n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to merge CBS Radio with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. Though CBS shareholders own 72 percent of Entercom, the latter is still its own public company, effectively separating WOGL and its sister stations from KYW-TV and WPSG-TV. \n\n"}

It was constructed between 1896 and 1898 and is positioned on the corner of James Street and The Strand across from the Pier Head.\nDesigned by architects Richard Norman Shaw and J. Francis Doyle, it was built for the Ismay, Imrie and Company shipping company, which later became the White Star Line. After White Star merged with Royal Mail Line the headquarters remained at Albion House until 1934 at which time the British Government forced the merger of Cunard Line and White Star Line. The building is situated on the corner of The Strand and James Street. The facade is constructed from white Portland stone and red brick. In 1912, when news of the disaster of the \"Titanic\" reached the offices, the officials were too afraid to leave the building, and instead read the names of the deceased from the balcony. During World War II, the gable was damaged and was later rebuilt in the late 1940s.\n\nAfter many years being vacant, in 2014 the building was converted into a Titanic-themed hotel known as 30 James Street.\n\nThe design closely follows the architect's earlier work of 1887, the former New Scotland Yard building in London. In the 1980s, the Offices in Albion House were noted for their exquisite Office desks of fine wood. The entrance to the building at James Street has a fine mosaic of South America set into the floor, also near the James Street entrance inside Albion House was a wooden war memorial listing the members of staff who \"Gave their lives for their country\" in the 1914-18 War.\n\nAlbion House is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2274938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274938", "title": "Friday the 13th Part 2", "text": "Friday the 13th Part 2\n\nFriday the 13th Part 2 is a 1981 American slasher film produced and directed by Steve Miner in his directorial debut, written by Ron Kurz, and starring Amy Steel and John Furey. The film also features the return of Adrienne King, Betsy Palmer and Walt Gorney, who respectively portrayed Alice Hardy, Pamela Voorhees, and Crazy Ralph in the prior installment. It is the second installment in the \"Friday the 13th\" film series and a direct sequel to \"Friday the 13th\" (1980). It picks up five years later, where Jason Voorhees begins stalking the camp counselors at a nearby training camp on Crystal Lake.\n\nOriginally, \"Part 2\" was intended to be part of an anthology series of films based on the Friday the 13th superstition. However, after the popularity of the original film's surprise ending, the filmmakers opted to continue the story and mythology surrounding Camp Crystal Lake, a trend which would be repeated in every film in the franchise.\n\nLike the original film, \"Part 2\" faced opposition from the Motion Picture Association of America, who noted its \"accumulative violence\" as problematic, resulting in numerous cuts being made to allow an R rating. The film was released theatrically in North America on May 1, 1981.\n\nAlthough it did not gross as much as the original, \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" grossed $21.7 million in the U.S. on a budget of $1.2 million and received negative reviews from critics. A direct sequel, \"Friday the 13th Part III\", was released one year later.\n\nTwo months after the murders at Camp Crystal Lake, sole survivor Alice Hardy is recovering from her traumatic experience. In her apartment, when Alice opens the refrigerator to get her cat some food, she finds the severed head of Pamela Voorhees in her refrigerator and is murdered by an unknown assailant with an ice pick to her temple.\n\nFive years later, Paul Holt opens a school for camp counselors on the shore of Crystal Lake. The camp is attended by Sandra Dier, her boyfriend Jeff Dunsberry, troublemaker Scott Cheney, tomboy Terry McCarthy, wheelchair-bound Mark Jarvis, sweet-natured Vickie Perry, jokester Ted Bowen, and Paul's assistant Ginny Field, as well as many other trainees. Around the campfire that night, Paul tells the counselors about the legend of Jason Voorhees, of how he survived his drowning, grew up living in the woods, and is now seeking to kill any intruders to avenge his mother's death. A man with a spear scares everyone, but it's only Ted in a mask. Paul reassures everyone that Jason is dead and that Camp Crystal Lake is now condemned and off limits. That night, Crazy Ralph wanders onto the property to warn the group but is garroted from behind a tree. The following day, Jeff and Sandra sneak off to Camp Crystal Lake and find a carcass before getting caught by Deputy Winslow and returned to the camp. Later, Winslow spots someone masked in a burlap sack running across the road and chases him into the woods and to a shack before he is killed with a hammer claw.\n\nBack at camp, Paul offers the others one last night on the town before the training begins; six stay behind, including Jeff and Sandra, who are forced to stay as punishment for sneaking off. At the bar, Ginny muses that if Jason were still alive and had witnessed his mother's death, it may have left him with no distinction between life and death, or right and wrong. Paul dismisses the idea, proclaiming that Jason is nothing but an urban legend. Meanwhile, the assailant appears at the camp and kills the counselors, one by one. Scott has his throat slit with a machete while caught in a rope trap, and Terry is killed off-screen upon finding his dead body. Mark gets the machete slammed into his face and falls down a flight of stairs. The killer then moves upstairs and impales Jeff and Sandra with a spear as they have sex, and then stabs Vickie with a kitchen knife.\n\nLater, Ginny and Paul return to find the place in disarray. In the dark, the killer ambushes Paul and continues to chase Ginny throughout the camp and into the woods, where she comes across the shack. After barricading herself inside, she finds an altar with Pamela Voorhees' head on it, surrounded by a pile of bodies. Realizing that Jason Voorhees is the killer, Ginny puts on Pamela's sweater and tries to psychologically convince Jason that she is his mother. The ruse works for a time when Jason visualizes Pamela Voorhees talking to him, but fails when he spots his mother's head on the altar and resumes his stalking of Ginny. Paul appears and attacks Jason, but he is quickly overwhelmed. Just as Jason is about to kill Paul with a pickaxe, Ginny picks up the machete and slams it down into Jason's shoulder, seemingly killing him.\n\nPaul and Ginny return to the cabin. They think that Jason has followed them, but when they open the door, they are greeted by Terry's dog, Muffin. Suddenly, an unmasked Jason bursts through the window from behind and grabs Ginny. She then awakens to being loaded into an ambulance. She calls out for Paul, who is nowhere to be seen, his fate left ambiguous. Back in the shack, Pamela Voorhees' head remains on the altar.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Friday the 13th\" in 1980, Paramount Pictures began plans to make a sequel. First acquiring the worldwide distribution rights, Frank Mancuso, Sr. stated, \"We wanted it to be an event, where teenagers would flock to the theaters on that Friday night to see the latest episode.\" The initial ideas for a sequel involved the \"Friday the 13th\" title being used for a series of films, released once a year, that would not have direct continuity with one another but be a separate \"scary movie\" in their own right. Phil Scuderi—one of three owners of Esquire Theaters, along with Steve Minasian and Bob Barsamian, who produced the original film—insisted that the sequel have Jason Voorhees, Pamela's son, even though his appearance in the original film was only meant to be a joke. Steve Miner, associate producer on the first film, believed in the idea and would go on to direct the first two sequels, after Cunningham opted not to return to the director's chair. Miner would use many of the same crew members from the first film while working on the sequels. Cunningham had mixed feelings about the entire \"Friday the 13th\" enterprise that he outlined for film critic and author Stephen Hunter in an interview for a book Hunter wrote on violent films. Hunter stated that Cunningham \"wasn't particularly proud\" of his work on these films, and Cunningham bluntly said that the only thing that seemed to reach a teenaged audience at that time involved high levels of gore and graphic violence.\n\nAdrienne King was pursued by an obsessed fan after the success of the original \"Friday the 13th\" and purportedly wished her role to be small as possible, though in the documentary \"\", it was stated that King's agent had asked for a higher salary, which the studio could not afford.\n\nThe film's heroine, Ginny, is played by Amy Steel, who won the part through an audition. \"At the time of [making the film], it was before the genre really picked up so I didn’t give it a lot of credit or take it seriously. For me, it was just another audition because I had no idea what it would end up meaning after all this time. When I played Ginny, I was really young and different from a lot of the people working at the time so that came out in my character. I was naturally suspicious of cocky guys at that age, and you see a lot of that when I’m on screen with Paul (John Furey). I tried to put so much behind the actual words in the script just so she felt almost unreachable, to Paul and to audiences. I wanted her to have some power.\"\n\nActor Warrington Gillette played Jason unmasked at the end of the film. Stuntman Steve Daskawisz (also known as Steve Dash) was credited as Jason Stunt Double but played the masked Jason throughout the rest of the film.\n\nPrincipal photography took place from October 3 and finished in November 1980, and primarily occurred in New Preston and Kent, Connecticut. Special effects artist Tom Savini was asked to work on the film but declined because he was already working on another project, \"Midnight\" (1982). In addition, he was not receptive to the concept of Jason as the killer in the film. Savini was then replaced by Stan Winston. Winston, however, had a scheduling conflict and had to drop out of the project. The make-up effects were ultimately handled by Carl Fullerton. Fullerton designed the \"look\" for the adult Jason Voorhees and went with long red hair and a beard while following the facial deformities established in the original film in the make-up designed by Tom Savini for Jason as a child. Fullerton's look for the adult Jason was abandoned in the sequel, \"Friday the 13th Part 3\", despite the fact that the film took place the following day and was helmed by the same director, Steve Miner. Some fans have theorized that the sequence showing Jason with a beard and long hair reflects a \"dream\" rather than a reality because the following sequel picks up with the events showing his face having not happened, and therefore what was represented was Ginny's \"guess\" at what he looked like under the burlap sack rather than what he \"actually\" looked like, which would excuse the break in continuity.\n\nSteve Daskawisz was rushed to the emergency room during filming after Amy Steel cut his hand with a machete. Steel explained, \"The timing was wrong, and he didn't turn his pickaxe properly, and the machete hit his finger.\" Daskawisz received thirteen stitches on his middle finger. During the subsequent shoot, Daskawisz was forced to wear a piece of rubber over his finger, and both he and Steel insisted on reshooting this scene. During one take of Alice being killed by Jason, the ice pick prop didn't retract, injuring King.\n\nIn one scene where Daskawisz was wearing the burlap flour sack, part of the flour sack was flapping at his eye, so the crew used tape inside the eye area to prevent it from flapping. Daskawisz received rug burns around his eye from the tape from wearing the rough flour sack material for hours. The use of the sack hood was similar to the 1976 film \"The Town That Dreaded Sundown\".\n\nThe scene where Steel's character gets grabbed from behind by an unmasked Jason in the climax took three takes to shoot it right. Steel was tense and frightened during filming of the scene.\n\nRumors sparked that John Furey left before the film wrapped, as his character does not appear in the end. In truth, his character was not intended to have appeared.\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" had difficulty receiving an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). Upon reviewing the film, the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA) warned Paul Hagger, an executive at Paramount, that the \"accumulation of violence throughout the film\" may still lead to an X rating even if substantial cuts were made.\n\nA total of forty-eight seconds had to be cut from the film in order to avoid an X rating. This film received a deluxe DVD release in February 2009, but the edited footage was not included. Most noted by censors was the murder scene of Jeff and Sandra, who are impaled by a spear while having sex in a bed (a scene many have compared to a scene in Mario Bava's \"A Bay of Blood\"), which the censors found particularly graphic. After Paramount discovered actress Marta Kober was underage, a scene showing her with full frontal nudity was completely deleted.\n\nOriginally, the film was supposed to end with Mrs. Voorhees' head opening her eyes and smiling towards the camera. However, Miner removed the scene out of the final film as he ultimately decided that would make the film's conclusion \"too silly\". To this day, the footage of this alternate ending has yet to be released.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on May 1, 1981, bringing in $6,429,784 its opening weekend. It played on 1,350 screens and would ultimately gross $21.7 million on a budget of $1.2 million. It was the 35th highest-grossing film of 1981, facing strong competition from such high-profile horror releases as \"\", \"The Evil Dead\", \"The Howling\", \"My Bloody Valentine\", \"Happy Birthday to Me\", \"Graduation Day\", \"Halloween II\", and \"The Burning\".\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" holds a 28% approval rating based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 4.46/10. The consensus reads: “\"Friday the 13th Part 2\" sets the template for the franchise to follow with more teen victims, more gruesome set pieces, and fewer reasons to keep following along.”\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote that \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" is \"a cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead teenager genres; about two dozen movies a year feature a mad killer going berserk, and they're all about as bad as this one. Some have a little more plot, some have a little less. It doesn't matter.\" Helen Verongos of \"The Clarion-Ledger\" wrote: \"\"Friday the 13th Part 2\" obviously does not pretend to be any more than it is, a cheapdimestore cheapthriller aimed at the adolescent market...  It is designed to be predictable enough to make the average fourth-grader feel sharp-witted.\"\n\nThe Dayton \"Journal Herald\"s Terry Lawson deemed the film a \"special effects freak show for an audience immune to violence,\" and \"exploitative and gratuitous.\" Jacqi Tully of the \"Arizona Daily Star\" praised the film's special effects, noting Jason as \"effectively disgusting sight,\" and ultimately summarizing: \"Gross is a pretty good way to describe it. Scary, bloody and violent come to mind, too. Also very effective.\" Howard Pousner of \"The Atlanta Constitution\" was less laudatory, deeming the return of the Jason Voorhees character as a \"ludicrous arrangement...  before you know it, eight more people have been murdered in virtually every manner: a neck sliced by barbed wire, a skull smashed, a jugular macheteed \"sic\", a heart speared, et al.\"\n\nWhen reviewing the film's Blu-ray release, David Harley of \"Bloody Disgusting\" said, \"It doesn't exactly stray far from the formula of the original film — neither do most of the other sequels — but \"Friday The 13th Part II\" still stands as an iconic and important entry in the series due to the introduction of Jason as the antagonist of the series and the usage of Italian horror films as an inspiration for its death scenes — most notably, the spear copulation death from Mario Bava’s \"A Bay of Blood\".\" Scott Meslow of \"The Week\" described it as a transitional film that blended elements of the original film and those to come later in the series.\n\nIn 2014, the film ranked at number one on a list of the 100 Greatest Slasher Movies on the genre website Vegan Voorhees.\n\n\"Friday the 13th Part 2\" was released on VHS and Betamax by Paramount Home Video in 1981. Paramount reissued the VHS again in 1994. The film was first released on DVD by Paramount on October 19, 1999, in a standard widescreen release featuring the theatrical trailer as the sole bonus feature.\n\nIn 2009, Paramount issued a \"deluxe edition\" of the film on both DVD and Blu-ray, which included several documentary featurettes along with the theatrical trailer. In 2011, it was released in a 4-disc DVD collection along with the first, third, and fourth films in the series. It was again included in two Blu-ray sets: \"Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection\", released in 2013, and \"Friday the 13th: The Ultimate Collection\", in 2018.\n\nIn 1982, Gramavision Records released an LP album of selected pieces of Harry Manfredini's scores from the first three \"Friday the 13th\" films. On January 13, 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini's scores from the first six films. It sold out in less than 24 hours. Waxworks Records released the score, composed by Harry Manfredini, on vinyl in summer 2015.\n\nA novelization based on the screenplay of Ron Kurz was published in 1988: Hawke, Simon, \"Friday the 13th Part II: A Novel\", New American Library, New York, 1988, \n\n\n"}

Due to a lack of an UniMás affiliate in the Milwaukee market, it is carried on DirecTV as part of that market's local channel lineup (channel 60 in both Chicago and Milwaukee).\n\nThe UHF channel 60 allocation to Aurora was originally occupied by WLXT-TV, which broadcast from May 16, 1969 to July 17, 1970. WLXT was an independent station that abruptly closed after 14 months of attempting to serve its suburban coverage area, but it was notable for the people that passed through it, particularly news director Christine Lund, who became a well-known news anchor in Los Angeles, and Tom Skilling, longtime chief meteorologist at WGN-TV (channel 9), who got his start in television broadcasting at WLXT and presented daily weather forecasts for the station during his junior year of high school.\n\nWhen applications for channel 60 were reopened in 1978, considerable interest was attracted. Several applicants proposed a new Spanish-language television station, including the Spanish International Network (which ended up applying for channel 66 instead) and a local group headed by Marcelino Miyares, the owner of Spanish-language advertising agency OMAR. The Miyares group became known as Hispanic American Television–Chicago and eventually HATCO-60 when it merged with competing applicant Aurora-Chicago Telecasters, Inc. The FCC received five proposals, three of which were designated for hearing by the FCC in July 1980: HATCO-60 (specifying West Chicago; Metrowest Corporation, specifying Aurora; and the College of DuPage, for Glen Ellyn.\n\nIn late 1981, HATCO-60 and Metrowest agreed to a shared-time agreement. Under the agreement, Metrowest would broadcast daily from 2:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., while the Hatco-60 station would broadcast daily from 7 p.m. to 2:30 a.m., giving channel 60 the distinction of being the only split-licensed station in the United States (and the first to operate in more than 20 years).\nWith the arrangement in place, the two stations signed on in April 1982, sharing transmitter facilities atop the Sears Tower. Eychaner signed on independent station WPWR-TV.\n\nAt the same time WPWR debuted, Miyares signed on WBBS-TV (a callsign assigned to the station by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over the objections of CBS owned-and-operated station WBBM-TV, channel 2), which maintained a Spanish-language entertainment format as an affiliate of NetSpan (which would evolve into Telemundo in 1987). WBBS featured various programming aimed at Hispanic audiences including local news programming, telenovelas and variety series as well as other locally produced shows, such as the popular music video program \"Imagen\", hosted by local Spanish-language television personality (and now media executive) Rey Mena and Vivianne Plazas. One of the notable events for WBBS occurred in 1983, when the station introduced the Latin teen pop group Menudo (which included a young Ricky Martin), to Chicago's Latino community. The station's primary competitor was WCIU-TV (channel 26, now an English language independent station), which was then a part-time affiliate of the Spanish International Network (the forerunner to the present-day Univision).\n\nBoth stations shared one critical piece of programming: a new subscription television service called SportsVision (a companion service to ONTV), which Eychaner and Miyares had developed through a deal with Chicago White Sox co-owners Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn. In order to access the service, viewers had to purchase a set-top descrambling converter and pay a monthly subscription fee in order to view sporting events such as White Sox games. However, SportsVision achieved little success on WPWR/WBBS-TV and converted into a cable channel in January 1984. With SportsVision removed from the station, WPWR ran public domain movies, cartoons and classic sitcoms from the early to mid-1950s to fill its schedule. In 1984, more popular classic sitcoms and newer barter cartoons were mixed into the lineup.\n\nIn the spring of 1985, WSNS-TV (channel 44) ended its five-year run as an affiliate of the ONTV subscription service and announced that would affiliate with SIN. In response to losing access to SIN programming, WCIU chose to align with NetSpan. Miyares, realizing that the loss of the NetSpan affiliation would be crippling for his station, reduced WBBS' programming schedule to 8 p.m. to its late-night sign-off on weekend evenings late that year, selling the rest of the weekday time periods that his station had occupied to Eychaner, allowing WPWR to broadcast full-time on weekdays.\n\nIn 1984, Eychaner acquired the construction permit for WDAI, a proposed station that would be licensed to Gary, Indiana and broadcast on UHF channel 56, for $1.5 million. The permit had been held by a group of Indiana businessmen doing business as GWWX-TV and later Great Lakes Broadcasting. The WDAI construction permit had existed since 1982, but short-spacing concerns to channel 60 and to two allocations in southeast Wisconsin had meant channel 56 could not be placed on the Sears Tower; this finding crippled a previous attempt to build the allocation as WGMI in 1968. However, another channel allocated to Gary could: channel 50, which as educational station WCAE had folded the previous year due to financial problems. The license was transferred to Northwest Indiana Public Broadcasting, but NIPB was not able to reactivate the station from improved facilities without an infusion of resources. Eychaner paid $684,000 to Northwest Indiana Public Broadcasting, giving it the funding it needed to build its facility, if it would switch allocations with WDAI. The move had been initially designed to potentially allow WBBS-TV to go full-time on channel 60, but the loss of affiliation doomed those plans. In August 1986, the commission issued final orders switching the commercial and noncommercial allocations for Gary. This allowed Metrowest to proceed with its plan of moving the WPWR-TV intellectual unit from channel 60 to channel 50 while selling the channel 60 license; the noncommercial allocation shifted to channel 56, which signed on as WYIN on November 15, 1987.\n\nIn October 1985, Eychaner purchased WBBS for $11 million, and WBBS aired its last programs in August 1986 when the sale was approved. Channel 50 was ready to sign on as a commercial outlet by October 1986, at which point Eychaner then sold the channel 60 allocation to the Home Shopping Network for $25 million. HSN, which owned the station through its Silver King Television arm, changed the station's call letters to WEHS (originally planned to be changed to WHSI). WPWR moved to channel 50 on January 18, 1987, at which time the channel 60 signed on as an HSN owned-and-operated station, with its only diversions from the master HSN schedule being the minimum fulfillment of local and educational programming requirements.\nBarry Diller—then-owner of the USA Network—acquired Silver King Communications in November 1995; the sale was finalized on December 19, 1996, ten months after its March 11 approval by the FCC. By 1997, the company was known as USA Broadcasting. In January 1999, USA Broadcasting considered converting WEHS into a general entertainment independent station under the \"CityVision\" programming model infusing local and syndicated programming that was adopted by its Miami sister station WAMI-DT in June 1998; under such a change, it also proposed changing the station's call letters to WNDE (meaning \"Windy\", in reference to Chicago's nickname, \"The Windy City\").\n\nHowever, before the proposed conversion into an independent station could occur, the plans were put into question after USA Broadcasting announced that it would sell off its television station group in 2000. Among the prospective buyers for the group was The Walt Disney Company, which placed a bid to acquire the 13 USA-owned stations (had Disney's bid been successful, it would have created the market's first television duopoly with ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV, channel 7); however, Disney was outbid by Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications, which purchased the USA Broadcasting stations in a $1.1 billion group deal on December 7, 2000; the sale was finalized on May 21, 2001. As a result, channel 60 changed its call letters to WXFT, and became a charter owned-and-operated station of Univision's new network, Telefutura (the forerunner to UniMás), when that network launched on January 14, 2002.\n\nWXFT's 5,000,000-watt transmitter malfunctioned in the early hours of December 6, 2006, causing an alarm which forced action by the Chicago Fire Department to extinguish the smoldering equipment. The transmitter was destroyed, leaving only one-half of its power available. The station also remained available via cable, which were fed via a direct connection from the station. A new transmitter was commissioned on January 11, 2007, restoring normal operation.\n\nWXFT shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 60, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal moved from its pre-transition UHF channel 59 to channel 50. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 60, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nIn December 2009, WXFT and sister station WGBO, along with most of Univision's other owned-and-operated stations, upgraded their main digital channels to transmit in 1080i high definition, in preparation for the launches of Univision and Telefutura's HD simulcast feeds in 2010.\n\nOn April 13, 2017, station owner Univision Communications announced that the over-the-air spectrum of WXFT-DT was sold in the FCC's spectrum reallocation auction for $126.1 million. In January 2016, the ABC Owned Television Stations group, owners of WLS-TV announced that they will enter into a channel sharing agreement with Univision for WXFT. WXFT-DT will not go off the air, but they will share spectrum with WLS-TV. In June 2017, a construction permit was filed to allow the spectrum share.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n"}

{"id": "2274978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274978", "title": "Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies", "text": "Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies\n\nThe Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies (CDAAA) was an American mass movement, political action group formed in May 1940. Also known as the White Committee, its leader until January 1941 was William Allen White. Other important members included Clark Eichelberger and Dean Acheson. The CDAAA shared its leadership with the dissolved Non-Partisan Committee for Peace through Revision of the Neutrality Law (NPC), who was also chaired by White and directed by Eichelberger. Additionally, the CDAAA used ex-NPC offices in the League of Nations building at 8 W. Fortieth Street in New York City, as their central base. This has drawn commentators to regard the CDAAA as the successor to the NPC.\n\nThe primary objective of the CDAAA was to achieve pro-British politics in U.S. government against the Axis Powers. This included economic and material support by America through the Destroyer-for-Bases Agreement and the Lend-Lease policy. The CDAAA, however, advocated against the declaration of war against Germany or any other belligerents until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. \n\nUnlike other pro-intervention groups like the NPC and Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression (ACNPJA), the CDAAA actively incorporated the public into committees. As a result, 300 self-financed, self-controlled local units had been created across America by 1st July 1940. This improved the mobilisation of its membership, which was especially significant considering its reliance on its members for outreach work. For example, volunteers from the Minneapolis unit sent out thousands of mimeographed letters, pamphlets, \"V for Victory\" stickers, \"Stop Hitler\" matches and aid-to-Britain Christmas cards during the war to gather funding and draw support for intervention on behalf of the Allies. However, while their geographic coverage was broad, the CDAAA lacked depth in various U.S. States: while Massachusetts had 137 chapters in April 1941, Idaho only had 1. \n\nThe CDAAA used a \"qualitative approach\" when structuring their organisation to counter the wealthy, white male predominance of their leadership and target groups that were divided on the issue of U.S. intervention into World War Two. This meant separating the organisation into four distinct groups: the youth division, the college division, the women's division, and the labour division.\n\nThe committee targeted African-Americans as a group to cultivate support, which helped diversify their membership. They released pamphlets such as \"Coloured People Have a Stake in the War\" to relate pro-Allied intervention to entice their membership. High-profile African-Americans, such as Ralph Bunche- who, from 1941, held a position in the Office of Strategic Services [OSS]- were included in their national committee. \n\nThe CDAAA campaigned for anti-discriminatory legislation that coincided with their pro-interventionist stance. For example, in response to Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802, the CDAAA published a press release that called for an extension of the ban on racist employment practices to the armed services, as \"anti-Negro discrimination was inconsistent with the democratic principles which the American people as a whole are being called upon to defend.\" \n\nHowever, the CDAAA's segregation of African-American membership caused resentment within their communities; when Phillip A. Randolph joined the CDAAA, he argued that the formation of a separate \"Negro-branch\" undermined the independence of African-American organisations and \"savour[ed] jim-crowism\". \n\nThe primary concern of the CDAAA was to ensure America's national security during the Second World War. It believed the best strategy for this was the provision of economic and material support to its allies, especially Britain's campaign against Nazi Germany. In a statement in July 1940, White made this position clear; he argued that Britain was America's first line of defence and that, if Britain were not supported, the United States would become \"the subject of an envy that would lead to attack.\" In spite of their interventionist advocacy, the CDAAA refused to further their aims towards a declaration of war against the Axis Powers. \n\nIn May 1940, Winston Churchill requested the purchase of U.S.Navy Destroyers to bolter the British Royal Navy. F. D. Roosevelt was hesitant to agree because of the Neutrality Acts, which banned the shipment or sale of arms from the U.S. to any combatant nation, and the existing anti-interventionist sentiment that drove the passage of these reforms. Furthermore, this request coincided with election year, which made Roosevelt increasingly sensitive to public opinion. \n\nIn response, the CDAAA campaigned to drive popular support for the selling of military resources to Britain. Robert Sherwood penned the provocative newspaper advertisement \"Stop Hitler Now\", published on 10th June 1940, which urged the American people to ask their president and congressional representatives to support maximum aid to the Allies. He argued that the conquest of Europe would leave America \"alone in a barbaric world.\" This effort was supported by the Pershing Address on 4th August 1940, which the CDAAA organised with co-operation with the Century Group. John J. Pershing's comments gained significant traction from the press, with the New York Herald Tribune printing the story as its front-page and the New York Times publishing it under the headline, “Pershing Warns U.S. to Aid Britain by Sending 50 Destroyers Now.” \n\nAlongside popular mobilisation, the CDAAA pursued the legitimisation of this suggested trade by finding legal grounding from existing laws. On 11th August 1940, a document named “No Legal Bar Seen to Transfer of Destroyers\" was published, which suggested that no further consent was required from Congress for Roosevelt to conduct the selling of Navy Destroyers to Britain. This was signed by Charles C. Burlingham of the New York Bar, former solicitor general Thomas D. Thatcher, former Federal Trade Commission member George Rublee, and Dean Acheson.\n\nIn the build-up to the 1940 election, the CDAAA worked to ensure that no partisan debate arose in regard to the degree of American intervention into World War Two. This was facilitated by their nonpartisan position, which allowed them to endorse both Roosevelt and Wendel Willkie, who were both pro-interventionists. When Willkie was announced as the Republican candidate on 17th August, he didn't explicitly refer to the destroyers but did concede that the loss of the British fleet would “greatly weaken our defense” and an Atlantic dominated by Germany would be “a calamity.”\n\nOn September 3, 1940, in retrospect of popular and legal opinion swinging into his favour, Roosevelt announced the exchange of 50 U.S.warship in return for the right to lease naval and air bases in eight different British territories.\n\nThis was a great success for the CDAAA. Following the election, on November 26, 1940, the CDAAA released a new statement of policy to further their aims. It included support for \"the maintenance of the lifeline between Great Britain and the United States,\" the \"assumption by Congress of greater responsibility with the President,\" and the repeal of \"restrictive legislation.\"\n\nSimilar to in 1940, the CDAAA used popular pressure to exert influence over the U.S. government in favour of Lend-Lease. This was primarily directed towards its success in Congress, which they now had direct access to due to the role of their new leader, Ernest Gibson, as Senator of Vermont. In 1941, Gibson presented their position in a statement of support for the bill before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Previous to this, he had endorsed the bill in spite of its implications on Presidential power, stating that \"only large powers will serve to meet the growing threat to our safety.”\n\nMeanwhile, Eichelberger used a radio debate against 1936 Republican presidential nominee Alf Landon to appeal for bipartisan support for the bill. \n\nThe CDAAA, again, provided legal support for the Lend-Lease bill. The group released a statement by George Rublee, one of the signatories of the New York Times letter of the previous August, that specifically opposed the dictatorship charges made in the minority report of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It states that “the Bill of Rights will still operate. This measure does not add to the powers the President already has as Commander in Chief of the Nation’s armed forces, and under which powers he could get us into war today, if he wanted to.” \n\nThis help facilitated the passage of the Lend-Lease bill through Congress, which was signed into law by Roosevelt on 11th March 1941. As the passage of the Lend-Lease bill ensured maximum aid to the Allies, the CDAAA had largely fulfilled its objectives of obtaining Allied support short of war. \n\nThe CDAAA competed for American sympathy with the America First Committee. Created on 4th September 1940, it was the main pressure group supporting complete neutrality and non-intervention.\n\nOn occasion, the CDAAA was accused of being a British front by its rivals. After the release of the “Stop Hitler Now” advertisement, Democratic West Virginia senator Rush Holt claimed that its funding was sourced from industrialists, international lawyers, international bankers and directors of corporations in Britain. This painted the committee as a tool of big business and, thus, drove the CDAAA to provide the Department of State with details of those who had contributed financially to the advertisement’s publication and reprinting. This ensured that the “Stop Hitler Now” piece had been funded by “100% American sources.” \n\nIn September 1941, the CDAAA were criticised for having close British connections in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch article by Charles Ross. The story accused committee member John L. Balderson of frequent contact with the British embassy, Senator Holt highlighted Balderston’s role, stating that he “is not interested in preserving America but is directly under the British Ministry of Information.” As a result, Balderson was forced to step back from the CDAAA. \n\nWhen the No Foreign War Committee organized in mid-December 1940, its chair, Verne Marshall, said its mission was to counter the \"propaganda\" of the CDAAA, which had, he said, \"the same public psychology as that which was carefully created during the war period preceding our declaration of hostilities in April 1917.\" He said his group aimed to force the CDAAA to provide details \"specific, exact, and unequivocal\" of what it meant when it called for \"steps short of war.\" \n\nIn late 1940, there were reports of differences of opinion in the group's leadership after White made remarks that some thought to be at odds with the CDAAA program. He said: \"The only reason in God's world I am in this organization is to keep the country out of war... If I were making a motto for the Committee it would be 'The Yanks Are Not Coming.'\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia wrote White a letter of protest, accusing him of \"doing a Laval.\" This referred to French minister of state Pierre Laval, the principal figure in France's Vichy government's co-operation with Germany. Herbert Bayard Swope supported the mayor and said that the organization as a whole, despite what White had said, takes as its priority \"all possible aid to Britain and the allies.\" Meanwhile, the national director denied any differences and said everyone in the group supported Lend-Lease and opposed both appeasement and a negotiated peace. He quoted and endorsed White's statement: \"appeasement is treason to democracy.\" \n\nThe America First Committee capitalised upon these differences. Robert E. Wood suggested White’s statement offered a basis for national unity, as his remarks \"essential[ly] agreement with our position.”\n\nOn 2 January 1941, William A. White resigned as chairman of the CDAAA. White cited his age as his reason for resigning.\n\nErnest W. Gibson Jr. succeeded White as national chairman in January 1941.\n\nAfter Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the CDAAA dropped \"by Aiding the Allies\" from their name and became simply the Committee to Defend America (CDA). This was caused by the strong aversion from committee members to embracing Joseph Stalin and communism, who were now part of the Allied forces against the Axis Powers. The CDA maintained its official anti-communist stance in spite of American cooperation with the USSR. \n\nThe Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 effectively brought an end to the CDA by bringing America into war; this also marked the dissolution of the America First Committee.\n\nIn January 1942, the CDA merged with the Council for Democracy to form . The combined organization then dissolved in October 1942, marking the official cessation of the CDAAA. \n\n"}

Blackburn. It was introduced on ABC's television series \"Disneyland\", in the premiere episode of October 27, 1954. Fess Parker is shown performing the song on a log cabin set in frontiersman clothes, accompanied by similarly attired musicians. The song would later be heard throughout the \"Disneyland\" television miniseries \"Davy Crockett\", first telecast on December 15, 1954. This version was sung by The Wellingtons. Parker played the role of Davy Crockett in the miniseries and continued in four other episodes made by Walt Disney Studios. Buddy Ebsen co-starred as George \"Georgie\" Russel, and Jeff York played legendary boatman Mike Fink.\n\nArchie Bleyer, the president of Cadence Records, heard the song on the ABC telecast (December 15, 1954) and called Bill Hayes that night to gauge his interest in recording it. The next day, Hayes (vocals), Al Caiola (guitar), and Art Ryerson (guitar) recorded it in one take at an RCA studio in Manhattan. Other versions by Fess Parker and Tennessee Ernie Ford (recorded on February 7, 1955) quickly followed. All three versions made the Billboard magazine charts in 1955: Hayes' version made #1 on the weekly chart (from March 26 through April 23) and #7 for the year, Parker's reached #6 on the weekly charts and #31 for the year, while Ford's peaked at #4 on the weekly country chart and #5 on the weekly pop chart and charted at #37 for the year. A fourth version, by bluegrass singer Mac Wiseman, reached #10 on the radio charts in May 1955. The song also reached #1 on the Cash Box charts, from March 26 through May 14, 1955. A contemporary version also exists by Western singing group the Sons of the Pioneers. Over ten million copies of the song were sold.\nLouis Armstrong also recorded the song in 1968.\nIn the United Kingdom, Hayes' version reached #2 in the New Musical Express chart; Ford's version achieved #3, and a version by UK singer Max Bygraves reached #20. Several other British artistes recorded versions in 1955 and 1956, including Billy Cotton, Gary Miller, Ronnie Ronalde and Dick James.\n\nMembers of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.\n\nWalt Disney Productions launched a massive marketing campaign in the UK in 1955 to publicize the film \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\" (released in Britain in 1956) and to make the country's youth \"Crockett conscious\". There was already a \"Crockett craze\" in the U.S., where the episodes had become wildly popular. Crockett merchandise was produced \"en masse\", the most iconic item being the imitation coonskin cap. The craze became immensely popular amongst schoolchildren, and the ballad made its way across the Atlantic Ocean. A French version by Annie Cordy was number 1 for 5 weeks in France in August 1956.\n\nUnited States Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee wore a Davy Crockett cap during the 1956 campaign, as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. Adlai Stevenson and Kefauver lost in the general election to incumbents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon.\n\nThe Crockett phenomenon is referenced in books of the time such as \"Back in the Jug Agane\", one of the Molesworth series by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle.\n\nThe craze was referenced in the film \"Back to the Future\", which is set predominantly in 1955. In the film, the Fess Parker version of the song is heard on a jukebox inside Lou's Diner and, in a later scene, one of Lorraine Baines' brothers appears wearing a coonskin cap. The song is sung by the characters Henry and Sammy in the Country Bear Jamboree. The 2009 film \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" opens with the eponymous fox playing the song on his belt radio.\n\nSeveral parodies were issued in 1955, including \"Duvid Crockett\" by Mickey Katz; \"Pancho Lopez\" by Eduardo Lalo Guerrero; \"Ole Svenson\" by Yogi Yorgesson; and \"The Ballad of Davy Crew-Cut\" by Homer and Jethro. \n\nIn the \"South Park\" episode \"Raising the Bar\", James Cameron plays the song during his underwater voyage to literally \"raise the bar\" for morality's sake, except this version replaces Davy Crockett with James Cameron himself, therefore being a parody.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2275001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275001", "title": "Wordplay (game show)", "text": "Wordplay (game show)\n\nWordplay is an American game show which ran on NBC from December 29, 1986 to September 4, 1987. It was hosted by Tom Kennedy, with Jamie Farr substituting for Kennedy for one week of shows, and announced by Charlie O'Donnell. The show was produced by Scotti Vinnedge Television in association with Fiedler/Berlin Productions and Rick Ambrose Television.\n\nWhen it premiered on December 29, 1986 \"Wordplay\" was slotted in the 12:30 pm/11:30 am timeslot following \"Super Password\". That slot had been occupied by the soap opera \"Search for Tomorrow\" for over four and a half years on NBC; the serial had aired continuously, first on CBS, since 1951 and was the longest running daytime program in history at the time of its cancellation.\n\nTwo contestants, one usually a returning champion, competed through three rounds to win money by guessing the definitions of unusual words. The gameboard consisted of a 3-by-3 grid of words, with the middle column shifted one level above the others. The contestant in control chose a word, and three celebrity panelists each gave a possible definition with an accompanying humorous anecdote. Panelists were provided with definitions before the show. If the contestant chose the correct definition, he/she won money; an incorrect choice gave the opponent a chance to steal the value with a correct guess.\n\nTwo words were played per round, with each contestant choosing one. The champion (or the contestant on the left, if there was no returning champion) played first in round one, the challenger in round two, and the trailing contestant (or, in case of a tie, the left contestant) in round three. Words were worth $25, $50, or $75 in round one; these values doubled in round two, and again in round three. Every word was horizontally and vertically connected to its immediate neighbors. Guessing a correct definition won not only the money for that word, but also the total of all values to which it was connected. For example, a $75 word connected to an already-defined $50 word would award $125 to the contestant who won it ($75 + $50). If a $150 word connected to either of these two values was guessed in a later round, it would award $275 ($150 + $75 + $50). If both contestants missed a word, a block was placed on the board in that location and all connections to it were broken.\n\nOne word per game was designated as the day's bonus word. Choosing this word and guessing its definition correctly awarded a bonus prize to the contestant, usually if not always a vacation, which was his/hers to keep regardless of the game's outcome.\n\nThe contestant with the higher total after three rounds advanced to the bonus round. If the game ended in a tie, a seventh word was played, selected by the champion (or the contestant on the left). Each celebrity gave a brief definition with no accompanying story, and the champion had the option to either play the word or pass it to the challenger. A correct guess won the game, while an incorrect guess gave the victory to the opponent.\n\nThe day's champion advanced to the Double Definitions bonus round for an accumulating cash jackpot. The round was originally titled \"Speedword\" for the first week, but was quickly changed once the producers realized that fellow NBC game show \"Scrabble\" had been using the term for more than two years at the time. The gameboard for this round was a grid of 24 numbered spaces, in four rows of six, with each space vertically and horizontally connected to its immediate neighbors. When the champion called a number, Kennedy read two definitions for a word (such as \"Writing Implement/Animal Enclosure\" for the word \"pen\"). Guessing the word awarded control of that space, while passing put up a block that the champion would have to go around. Multiple guesses were allowed with no penalty; the champion could move off a space only by giving a correct response or passing.\n\nThe champion had 45 seconds to complete a path connecting the left and right sides of the board. Doing so won the jackpot, which began at $5,000 and increased by $2,500 for every day it went unclaimed. Failing to complete the path won $100 per correct answer. The largest jackpot awarded on the show was $27,500, which occurred during the final week on the air.\n\nContestants were allowed to stay for three consecutive days or until they were defeated, whichever came first.\n\n\"Wordplay\" premiered on December 29, 1986, three days after the finale of \"Search for Tomorrow\", and inherited the soap opera's 12:30 p.m. Eastern timeslot. The series faced off against the first half-hour of the highly-rated \"The Young and the Restless\" on CBS and \"Loving\" on ABC, and did not perform well against both soap operas. NBC announced the cancellation of \"Wordplay\" in the summer of 1987 in order to make room for \"Win, Lose or Draw\" on the network's schedule; the final episode of the series aired on September 4, 1987. Three days after the final episode aired, \"Scrabble\" was moved to the 12:30 p.m. Eastern timeslot.\n\nThe series exists in its entirety and is in the possession of Fremantle, which inherited the rights to the series from its predecessor company Pearson Television, which in turn acquired those rights through the acquisition of Scotti Vinnedge Productions' parent All American Television.\n\nPrior to 2017, \"Wordplay\" had not been seen on television since its cancellation by NBC, but episodes circulated on YouTube through private collectors. Additionally, the series was one of six considered for a Sunday night slot on Buzzr called \"Pick & Play\" in the fall of 2015, but failed to generate enough votes from viewers to make it on the schedule. The series was later set to begin airing regularly on Buzzr two years later, in September 2017, only to be pulled by the channel after two days and replaced by \"Match Game\".\n\nThe pilot episode, shot in October 1986 for NBC, featuring Peter Tomarken as host and Rod Roddy as announcer, also exists. Highlights from the pilot were featured by Wink Martindale as part of his ongoing \"Wink's Vault\" series on YouTube, and it was later shown in its entirety as part of a Buzzr \"Lost and Found\" marathon in September 2017. This episode features a different layout for the word grid (a 4-by-3 rectangle with three blocks already in place) and a different theme song. The pilot theme was \"Hitting Home\", composed by British composers David Reilly & John Devereaux and released as part of the KPM Music library.\n\n"}

{"id": "2275029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275029", "title": "Pamela Voorhees", "text": "Pamela Voorhees\n\nPamela Voorhees () is a character from the \"Friday the 13th\" film series. She first appeared in Sean S. Cunningham's \"Friday the 13th\" (1980) as the vengeful mother of Jason Voorhees, and was simply known as Mrs. Voorhees. The character was created by Victor Miller, and was portrayed by Betsy Palmer in the original film, as well as \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" (1981). Pamela was portrayed by Marilyn Poucher in \"Friday the 13th Part III\" (1982).\n\nShe was portrayed by Paula Shaw in \"Freddy vs. Jason\" (2003). According to Palmer, she was asked to reprise her role for \"Freddy vs. Jason\" but turned it down after reading the script, as she stated in the \"\"Friday The 13th Reunion\"\". Nana Visitor played Pamela in the 2009 reboot.\n\nPamela (whose maiden name is never revealed) was born in 1930 (revealed in \"\"). At age 15, Pamela became pregnant by a man named Elias Voorhees. Very little is known about their romance and short marriage, aside from the fact that Pamela kept a class ring which she wore on her ring finger of her left hand (as seen in several scenes in the first \"Friday the 13th\" film). On June 13, 1946, at age 16, she gave birth to a hydrocephalic boy and she named him Jason, as shown in \"\". Because of his condition, Pamela never sent Jason to school, and was extremely overprotective of him.\n\nPamela got a job as a cook at Camp Crystal Lake by David and Louise Christy. On a fateful day in 1957, Jason, infuriated by the constant teasing and harassment from other children, snuck out of his cabin late at night to prove that he could swim. The counselors were not watching him at all, as they were at a party and making love in one of the adult cabins. Jason was never recovered from the lake and presumably drowned. Pamela blamed the counselors for his death because she was working the day that it happened.\n\nAfter Jason's death, Pamela began hearing auditory hallucinations and heard her son's voice telling her to kill the people who were responsible for his demise. In 1958, a year after Jason's death, Pamela brutally murdered two counselors (Barry and Claudette) in cold blood without showing any remorse because she believed they were responsible for her son's death. Camp Crystal Lake was closed after the murders and was nicknamed \"Camp Blood\" by local residents. When the owners tried to re-open the camp in 1962, Pamela returned, poisoned the water, and set several fires - the first film establishes that nobody knew who was responsible for these incidents. The camp was shut down once again, and did not re-open until 17 years later. Pamela lived in a house which bordered the Camp Crystal Lake.\n\nOn Friday, June 13, 1979, the new owner of Camp Crystal Lake, Steven \"Steve\" Christy, and seven young counselors - Annie Phillips, Alice Hardy, Bill Brown, Ned Rubenstein, Marcie Cunningham, Jack Burrell, and Brenda Jones - return to the deadly and dangerous campground to prepare it for reopening, even after several ominous warnings of a death curse by the local residents. Pamela, who does not want the camp re-opened for fear of another tragic accident, is enraged and goes on a savage killing spree: she slashes Annie's throat in the woods with her bowie knife, lures Ned inside a cabin to slit his throat, pierces Jack's throat with an arrow from underneath the bed, slams a felling axe into Marcie's face inside the bathroom stalls, and brutally attacks Brenda at the archery range. When Steve returns to the camp, not knowing of the murders, Pamela shines a flashlight at him before stabbing him in the chest.\n\nBill investigates the generator which has been turned off, and she slits his throat before pinning his body with arrows to the shed door. With Alice as the last remaining counselor, she finds Bill's body and barricades herself in the main cabin. After terrorizing Alice by throwing Brenda's body into one of the windows, she drives her jeep towards the cabin to lure Alice out, thinking Steve has returned. Outside, she greets the frightened Alice in a friendly manner and cites herself as a friend of Steve Christy. When she enters inside the cabin with Alice, she sees Brenda's body and begins to discuss about Jason's drowning in which she blames the counselors for not paying attention to his incident. As she begins to have visions of Jason's drowning, she turns violent and draws her bowie knife to attack Alice, but the surviving counselor strikes her with a fireplace poker. When Alice flees into the gun storage, Pamela violently slaps her before Alice stuns her by smacking the butt of a rifle into her face. As Pamela searches around the camp saying in Jason's voice \"kill her, mommy!\", she finds Alice inside a food closet and as she attacks with a machete, Alice renders her unconscious with a frying pan. When she later awakes, she finds Alice at the shore and attacks her once again. During the struggle, Alice gains the upper hand and she finally decapitates Pamela with her own machete, killing her. Her hands unnaturally clutch in the air before she finally dies.\n\nTwo months later, a mysteriously revived Jason carries out his own revenge by killing Alice. Jason had kept his mother's severed head, using it to frighten Alice by placing it in her refrigerator - before taking it along with his mother's corpse to his shack deep in the woods. The shack contains a shrine Jason has built for his mother, and he also stores the bodies of some of his victims there. After he is hit in the shoulder with a machete (the same machete with which Pamela was killed) and left for dead at the end of his first killing spree, he leaves his crudely-made home and his mother.\n\nPamela Voorhees is initially laid to rest in a run down, roadside cemetery seen in \"The Final Chapter\". When Jason is killed by Tommy Jarvis a few years later, it is presumed that her body is relocated to Eternal Peace Cemetery along with her son.\n\nAlthough Pamela does not share her son's immortality, she does reappear in later films. The character is seen again in the climax of \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" in which Betsy Palmer reprises her role when Jason sees his mother talking to him but it is one of Jason's potential victims trying to fool him. In the final scene, her mummified head is portrayed by actress Connie Hogan in makeup - originally intended for a deleted scene showing her opening her eyes and smiling. Pamela is seen again in \"Friday the 13th Part III\" when lone survivor Chris Higgins has a nightmare which ends with Pamela's corpse (played by the Second Assistant Director, Marilyn Poucher), wearing her blue sweater with head attached, reaching up from the lake to pull her under. She is seen again in \"Freddy vs. Jason\" (played this time by Paula Shaw), seen in Hell commanding her son to kill the children of Elm Street; however, it turns out that it is actually Freddy Krueger masquerading as Pamela in order to manipulate Jason for his own ends. Pamela appears very briefly in the more recent \"Friday the 13th\" reboot in the beginning credits chasing a young girl (presumably Alice). She is decapitated, as in the original film, and a young Jason Voorhees finds a locket containing pictures of him and his mother. Jason hears her voice telling him to \"kill for mother.\"\n\nIn an interview, John Carl Buechler revealed he had originally intended to have a scene in \"\" in which heroine Tina Shepard has a surreal vision in which Pamela's severed head appears in Jason's arms, repeatedly yelling \"help me mommy!\" The scene was never shot, due to being deemed too over-the-top. Reportedly, the character was to make another appearance for \"\" in a flashback. \"Jason X\" was originally meant to feature an appearance of Pamela in the holographic projection of Camp Crystal Lake that Jason is distracted by in the film; one idea was to even have Jason attack the virtual Pamela to show just how evil he had become.\n\nThe severed head of Pamela Voorhees is a major character in the first book of Eric Morse's \"Camp Crystal Lake\" series. In the novel, hunter Joe Travers finds an unmarked gravestone in the forest and digs nearby to find a wet cardboard box containing the still living head, having been reanimated by Jason's cursed mask. Pamela then gives him directions to the location of Jason's buried hockey mask, which he digs up and puts on, thus becoming possessed by Jason in the process. Carly, the novel's heroine, later discovers the head still in its box, still in the grave. During the final showdown with Pamela and the hunter, she destroys the head with a shotgun blast, killing Pamela.\n\nIn the non-canonical \"Jason vs. Leatherface\" comic miniseries by Topps Comics, Mrs. Voorhees is identified as Doris and appears in two flashbacks, one in the first issue and another in the second; in the first flashback, brought on by Jason being asked his name by Cook, she appears, face obscured, encouraging a young Jason as he writes his name on a chalkboard. The second flashback, provoked by Jason seeing the Hitchhiker abuse his younger brother Leatherface, has her killing Elias Voorhees with a machete when he attempts to beat Jason.\n\nThe comic one-shot \"Jason X Special\" by Avatar Press features Pamela coming back from the dead by possessing a swarm of nano ants. Discovering Jason has been captured by a bio-engineer named Kristen, Pamela releases him and guides him to a camp near Kristen's laboratory populated by androids, who Jason begins to destroy, quickly becoming disastified with these victims due to the fact that, as Pamela states, \"they aren't real.\" At the end of the comic, Pamela, after Jason is launched into space by Kristen, gets revenge on the bio-engineer by possessing her lover Neil and forcing him to stab Kristen in the stomach and slit his own throat. In the sequel to the one-shot, the two-issue miniseries \"Friday the 13th: Jason vs. Jason X\", Pamela appears only as a fragmented memory shared between Jason and his clone (which was created using a portion of Jason's brain). After Jason disposes of his clone and assimilates the portion of his brain it possessed, his memories of Pamela (who he and the clone did not recognize) are restored.\n\nIn the novel \"Jason X: Death Moon\" by Black Flame, a character, while in a holographic version of Crystal Lake, stumbles across an underwater recreation of Pamela's grave in the lake and is attacked by a zombified version of her created by Dr. Armando Castillo. In \"Friday the 13th: Hell Lake\", the character Gretchen Andrews, after an encounter with Jason, seemingly becomes possessed by Pamela. \"Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs\" involves Pamela possessing characters who come into contact with her severed head.\n\nIn 2007, a two issue comic miniseries titled \"Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale\", detailing much of Pamela's history, was printed by Wildstorm; the comics take place before the main events of \"Friday the 13th\" and feature Pamela picking up Annie, one of the Camp Crystal Lake counselors in-training, and recounting her past. She reveals that Elias abused her while she was pregnant, which may have caused Jason to be born deformed. Driven by what she believed to be the unborn Jason's voice, Pamela killed Elias with an axe, blew up their trailer and dumped her husband's body in Crystal Lake. After killing Elias, Pamela moved to Crystal Lake and got a job as a chef at a diner, later being hired as Camp Crystal Lake's cook by the Christy family. After telling Annie her origin Pamela, as in the film, slits her throat, but treats her body as if it were still alive afterwards. The miniseries ends with a recreation of the scene from the film where Pamela meets Alice at Camp Crystal Lake. In the two-issue miniseries \"Friday the 13th: How I Spent My Summer Vacation\", Pamela appears in a flashback to when she first brought Jason to Camp Crystal Lake in the first issue and the end of the second issue has Jason visiting his mother's grave.\n\nIn the first issue of the six-issue comic book miniseries \"Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash\", in a dream of Jason's, Freddy Krueger creates a vision of Pamela and uses it to manipulate Jason into seeking out the \"Necronomicon\" that is in the house that he and Pamela lived in when he was a child, as seen in the movie Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday. In the fifth issue of the miniseries, in addition to there being a portrait of Pamela in her and Jason's old house, it is implied that she used the Necronomicon to resurrect Jason after he drowned in Crystal Lake.\n\nPamela also appears in the \"Friday The 13th\" video game for the NES. Her severed head is a mini-boss in a hidden cave. It floats around after lifting itself off a pedestal surrounded by candles, reminiscent of the second movie. Just as Jason has to be defeated three times to complete the game, Pamela can also be fought three times, and each defeat earns the player a unique item — a powerful weapon (usually a machete or axe), then her sweater, and finally the pitchfork.\n\nIn the \"Friday The 13th\" video game titled \"Friday The 13th: The Game\", made by Gun Media and Illfonic, Pamela (whether it's the real Pamela or a figment of Jason's imagination is unknown), voiced by Jennifer Ann Burton, tells Jason to kill the camp counselors that have come to Camp Crystal Lake. In the game, there are 2 series of unlockable audio tapes, one of which follows Pamela after Jason's drowning, and the other of which follows Tommy Jarvis after the events of the 4th, 5th, and 6th films of the \"Friday The 13th\" film series. Pamela's tapes offer background information on Pamela and Jason's life before the latter's drowning, revealing that Jason was not actually the son of Elias Voorhees, but the product of a brutal rape by an unknown stranger. Pamela and Jason were heavily abused by Elias, culminating in Pamela murdering her husband. When questioned by the police on the murder, Pamela claims that she did on Jason's urging. The tapes also feature a brief, friendly exchange between Pamela and Dr. Malcolm Jarvis, the father of Jason's future nemesis Tommy Jarvis, who sympathizes with Pamela.\n\nAction figures of Pamela have been released by both Sideshow Collectibles and NECA.\n\n"}

He is the current Chairman and Chief Executive of the Bank of East Asia, and a former member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and the Executive Council of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Li family with roots in Heshan, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China has long had a prominent position in Hong Kong. David Li's great-grandfather, Li Shek-tang, made his fortune bringing rice to Hong Kong from Vietnam. In 1918, Li's grandfather, Li Koon-chun, along with his great-uncle, founded the Bank of East Asia, the first Chinese-owned bank in the territory. His father, F S Li, was a director of the Bank of East Asia, an Unofficial member of the Legislative Council and council member of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Li's younger brother is Arthur Li Kwok-cheung, former Secretary for Education and Manpower and Chairman of the Council of the University of Hong Kong.

He studied mathematics at Imperial College London, and then studied economics and law at Selwyn College, University of Cambridge.\n\nHe received an honorary doctorate in law from the University of Warwick in July 1994 and another one from the University of Hong Kong in March 1996. In November 1996, he received an honorary doctorate of social sciences from Lingnan College. Li joined the Bank of East Asia in 1969, becoming Chief Executive in 1981 and Chairman in 1997.\n\nDavid Li was a member of the Legislative Council, elected unopposed in the Finance functional constituency in 2004 and 2008.

In addition, he is chairman of the Chinese Banks Association Ltd.\n\nOn 1 May 2007, News Corporation made a public announcement of its bid for Dow Jones & Company. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed an initial complaint seven days later naming Wong Kan-king and his wife Charlotte, both residents of Hong Kong, as defendants after its investigation of suspicious share price movements in the run-up to the announcement. The SEC alleged that the couple purchased 415,000 shares through a Merrill Lynch Hong Kong account between 13 to 30 April, and had reaped a US$8.2 million profit on disposal following announcement of the bid.\n\nThe SEC later filed an amended complaint (\"The First Amended Complaint\") identifying the source of the information as David Li, who had obtained the information by being a board member of Dow Jones. The SEC alleged that Li had informed his close friend and business associate Michael Leung, who in turn told his daughter and son-in-law. The amended complaint added David Li and Michael Leung as co-defendants and details how Leung traded through the account of his daughter and son-in-law with their assistance.\n\nAt the end of January 2008, a settlement was reached where Li was ordered to pay an $8.1 million civil penalty, Leung to pay $8.1 million in disgorgement and an $8.1 million penalty; K. K. Wong would pay $40,000 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a $40,000 civil penalty. Li would neither admit nor deny any wrongdoing\n\nLi's integrity is being questioned by Legislators, and corporate gadfly David Webb was the first to put Li under pressure to relinquish his position as a member of both the Legislative and the Executive Councils of Hong Kong because of his implication in the affair. Several other legislators added to the pressure for Li to relinquish his cabinet (Exco) position, although there are divergent views on his continued LegCo membership. On 17 February 2008, Li announced his resignation from Exco.\n\nIn January 2017, prosecutors claimed that, in July 2010, Li had assisted the then Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Donald Tsang Yam-kuen (through Tsang's wife) in the latter's attempt to cover up an alleged corrupt deal to secure a super-luxury apartment in Shenzhen, by drawing a HK$350,000 cash cheque and passing the money to Tsang's wife.\n\nLi was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1991 New Year Honours. In 2001, he was awarded the Gold Bauhinia Star by the government of Hong Kong.\n\nIn the 2005 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was made a Knight Bachelor by the United Kingdom for his contributions to British education.

The band's debut album, \"Enter the Grave\", was produced by Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark and was released worldwide in 2007 by Earache Records to critical acclaim by fans and critics alike. The band's first reviews included a hail by \"Kerrang!\" as \"Carrying the genre's whole 'revival' on their shoulders.\" Their second album, \"Infected Nations\", was released on 21 September 2009. It was produced by Russ Russell, with artwork from Michael Whelan. Evile's third studio album \"Five Serpent's Teeth\" was released in 2011, also on Earache Records. A fourth album, entitled \"Skull\", was released in the late spring of 2013 on Earache. Evile are currently working on a new album.\n\nIn 1999, former school friends Matt Drake and Ben Carter came together over a mutual love for thrash metal and heavy metal and formed a cover band named Metal Militia (primarily playing Metallica classics) Matt's brother, Ol Drake, joined as the lead guitarist, and after London-born bassist Mike Alexander responded to the band's advert in a local guitar store looking for a bassist influenced by bands such as Metallica, Sepultura and Testament, the lineup was complete.\n\nAt the band's first live show, at the Ukrainian Club in Halifax, an audience member had a brick thrown at their face by area locals.\n\nIn 2004, the band ceased playing covers and dedicated their time to writing original material. Soon after, they independently recorded and released two EPs in limited quantities (250–500 units): \"All Hallows Eve EP\" (2004) and \"Hell Demo\" (2006). Evile toured extensively throughout the UK (2004–2006) and Netherlands (2006), played as the support act for Exodus and eventually signed to Earache Records. Though Earache had received the band's \"Hell Demo\", it was after label head Digby Pearson witnessed Evile's set at Bloodstock Open Air in 2006 that he contacted the band and signed them to the label. In an interview Matt Drake said that the band was originally supposed to be called \"Exile\", but there were \"a million other bands that called themself that\" so the \"X\" in the band's name was changed to a \"V,\" and the band became known as Evile.\n\nPrior to the album's recording, Matt Drake contacted producer Flemming Rasmussen (Metallica, Morbid Angel, Blind Guardian, Artillery) by doing a search for his name on Google and enquired as to whether or not he would like to hear Evile's material. Flemming responded positively, prompting Matt to send him some Evile mp3s via e-mail. Supposedly, Flemming never commented on the mp3s, causing Matt to presume that he \"hated them\", but when Earache Records contacted Flemming to request his skills as producer for Evile's debut, he swiftly accepted the offer.\n\nIn 2007, Evile recorded their debut album, \"Enter the Grave,\" at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen with producer Flemming Rasmussen and assistant engineer Anders H Mortensen. The album reached No. 33 on the UK rock album charts, and \"Kerrang!\" magazine awarded the album 4 out of 5 stars while dubbing Evile as \"Carrying the genre's whole 'revival' on their shoulders\". Generally, the album was received positively and received highly rated reviews, including those from \"Terrorizer\" Magazine (9/10), \"Metal Revolution\" (100/100) and Classic Rock (the 38th best album of 2007).\n\nThe band played many shows with class-acts such as Machine Head, and other bands such as Sabbat, Sanctity, Gama Bomb, Severe Torture and Desecration. On 11 December 2007, Evile participated in and won Metal Hammer's Get in the Ring 2, at the Kentish Town Forum, London. Four bands (Evile, Engel, Viking Skull and Goat the Head) performed thirty-minute sets inside a boxing ring and the public selected their favorite via SMS texts. The show was compered by Oderus Urungus of Gwar and the judges included Ville Valo of HIM. Valo commented that Evile were \"really tight and rhythmic\" but they were not his \"cup of tea.\" The competition was rebroadcast on Rockworld TV on SKY Channel 368 throughout January and February 2008 and included an hour-long supplement dedicated to Evile's GITR2 set.\n\nIn February and March 2008, Evile supported thrash metal band Megadeth on the European leg of their Tour of Duty and the UK leg of their Gigantour, opening for American deathcore band Job for a Cowboy. The band was received warmly throughout the respective tours, and on the final date, they briefly joined Megadeth on stage at the Hugennottenhalle in Frankfurt to sing the heavy metal anthem \"Peace Sells\". In March 2008, Evile's track \"Thrasher\" was featured on the Wii, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 video game \"Rock Band\" as downloadable content (part of the \"Earache Thrash Pack\"). In April 2008, the band embarked on a European tour alongside thrash veterans Exodus. During the tour, they allowed a 14-year-old fan to join them on stage to perform \"Enter the Grave\", and on a few occasions they joined Exodus in backing vocals on \"The Toxic Waltz,\" which was followed by the members of Exodus handing their instruments over to Evile to close the set.\n\nOn 8 October the release of Evile's first official Music Video. The video was \"Thrasher\", a song from their debut album, and was directed by Dan Fernbach (who directed bands such as Bullet For My Valentine). Also on 8 October the re-release of Evile's \"Enter the Grave\" via Earache Records. Included in the package was a lengthy DVD, Evile guitar pick (with three alternate designs), A woven patch and three bonus tracks.\n\nThe band later announced they would provide support to Satyricon on their European \"Tour of Nero\" in November/December 2008. Unfortunately, On 19 November 2008, while on the tour, lead guitarist Ol Drake reportedly collapsed due to health issues. His jaw was fractured and the under-side of his chin was cut open. Evile were forced to cancel their appearances on the remainder of the tour. He then had to have his jaw wired shut for two weeks for healing.\n\nBeginning in April 2009, Evile began the UK/Ireland \"We Who Are About to Tour\" tour along with UK death metal act Trigger the Bloodshed, and London Thrash band Mutant. Warpath, who were originally scheduled for the tour, pulled out two days prior to the start of the tour (though the unfortunate injury occurred a week before the tour) leaving Evile two days to find a replacement band. Evile played two brand new songs which would be featured on their second album; one entitled \"Demolition\" and one without a title, which on a nightly basis was open to being named by the audience.\n\nIn February 2009 Evile began the pre-production process for their second album with Russ Russell (who has worked with bands such as Napalm Death, The Exploited and Dimmu Borgir). May and June saw Evile enter Parlour Studios in Kettering with Russell to record the album. The band would post three video updates whilst in the studio, and give fans a chance to \"Ask Evile\" questions via their Myspace blog. On an Evile studio tour hosted by Ben the working titles of songs to be on the album could be seen written on a whiteboard.\n\nOn 22 June, Evile revealed that the title of the second album would be \"Infected Nations\", with artwork created by Michael Whelan (who also worked with the likes of Sepultura, Obituary and Stephen King). A video was posted online on the same day of Ol talking fans through the concept of the art, stood in front of a large poster print of the cover. The album was released on 21 September in Europe and 22 September in USA. \"Infected Nations\" jumped into the UK top 100 chart at number 91 following its first-day sales.\n\nThe band released three tracks publicly prior to the album's release. These tracks were \"Infected Nation\", \"Now Demolition\" and \"Nosophoros\". Evile released a music video for the track \"Infected Nation\" which, like \"Thrasher\" was directed by Dan Fernbach and Static Films once again. Also, like \"Thrasher\", displays the band playing a dynamically aggressive song in a very confined space.\n\nIn September 2009, Schmier of the German thrash metal classics Destruction asked lead guitarist, Ol Drake, to stand in for them on guitar. This was prompted by Destruction's guitarist, Mike Sifringer, breaking his fingers forcing them to find a temporary replacement.\n\nOn 5 October 2009, tragedy struck the band as their bass player, Mike Alexander, died whilst being rushed to hospital while the band were on tour in Luleå, Sweden. He died from a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot on the lungs. Evile unveiled a tribute site <http://www.mikealexander.co.uk> to their fallen member.\n\nIn early December 2009 the remaining members of Evile held two memorial nights for Mike. One was held in Leeds Rios and the other in the Camden Underworld, London. The night consisted of a covers set of some of Mike's favourite songs and bands, with members of the support bands (Gama Bomb, Mutant and Seregon) on the night stepping in on various instruments. Nick Barker (Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth, Testament, Exodus) also took to the stage on both nights to play drums for several tracks. Both shows saw each remaining member of Evile take to the stage to read out messages of thanks from Mike's girlfriend, children and Mother. The Leeds show saw Mike's mother take to the stage and express her thanks to Evile's fans.\n\nEvile were asked, by UK Magazine \"Metal Hammer\", to cover a Pantera track for their Dimebag Darrell tribute Issue. The band chose to cover \"Cemetery Gates\" with it being their favourite Pantera track. The track would go on to receive positive feedback, be released via iTunes and get substantial airplay in the United States. This would unfortunately be the last track recorded with Mike Alexander. A raffle was also organized prior to the nights to raise funds for Mike's children and family. Evile and Mike's family were overwhelmed to receive support from people/bands such as Ozzy Osbourne & Sharon Osbourne, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Machine Head, Exodus, Overkill, Trivium, Andy Sneap, Annihilator, Benediction, Hirax and more. The winners of the Raffle Prizes were announced via YouTube by Matt and Ol.\n\nEvile started auditions for a new bass player in late November/December 2009. They then announced dates for a 2010 UK/Europe tour. On 16 December it was reported that Joel Graham (formerly of Rise to Addiction) is the band's new bass player. In December Evile announced their first shows in USA/North America. One tour supporting Kreator alongside Voivod, Kataklysm and more. The other tour being in support to Overkill alongside Vader, God Dethroned and Warbringer.\n\nIn April 2010 Evile would pay tribute to their late bassist, Pantera and Dimebag Darrell by performing their cover of \"Cemetery Gates\" in the latter's birthplace of Dallas, Texas while on tour with Overkill in North America. Also in April 2010, it was announced that Evile would be returning to Bloodstock Open Air, playing main stage on Saturday 14 August. Evile will also be playing Hellfest, Wacken Open Air, Sonisphere and many more European Festivals.\n\nEvile's track \"Bathe in Blood\" was used in the film \"Ondine\" by Neil Jordan and starring Colin Farrell.\n\nFrom September 2010 to the end of December the band toured extensively throughout North America. The band had several headline dates as well as tours with veterans such as Overkill, D.R.I. and fellow thrash-band Gama Bomb. Also in February, Ol Drake took part in a \"Game with Fame\" session via Xbox Live, inviting gamers to play the videogame \"Rockband 3\" with him. The event was advertised on the Xbox Live Dashboard and took place for 3 hours (5pm-8pm EST). Around this time the entire \"Infected Nations\" album became available via the Rock Band Network, as well as the band achieving \"Artist of the Month\".\n\nOn 31 May, Evile revealed that they'd begun working on their third studio album. Ol Drake confirmed this via TwitLonger on 9 November and told that \"Album 3 is well on the way and will be out on Earache Records in mid 2011\". In February 2011 Evile embarked on a short UK tour to say goodbye to their \"Infected Nations\" album, while also showcasing a brand new track with the working title \"Bitch\". Matt also announced the third album will have the initials \"FST\". In March 2011 it was announced that Evile had entered Parlour Studios to begin recording their 3rd album with producer Russ Russell. Periodically, the band have been posting excerpts of the album's recording process on their official YouTube page. On 25 April, the band announced that their 3rd album was fully mixed and awaiting mastering.\n\nIn May 2011 Evile announced that they would pay tribute to their fallen bandmate, Mike Alexander, on the latest album. The track was entitled \"In Memoriam\". Ol Drake commented:\nIt goes without saying that there would be some element of the new album which was for Mike alone. We had a few ideas floating around which were out of the ordinary for Evile, and when Mike passed away those ideas just started to make more and more sense. \"In Memoriam\"'s initial intention was for Mike and Mike alone. All of us in the band have different views and thoughts on what the song means and who it is for, but it was born out of a want to include something special for Mike, his family and ourselves. As the song grew it started to take on a life of its own, so to speak. It is for anyone who's lost anyone close to them. There is a lot of meaning behind this song, and I expect a few people will question Evile doing such a song, but if the sentiment isn't understood, I couldn't care less. As our producer, Russ Russell said: \"It's a brilliant song for a brilliant guy.\"\n\nIt has been revealed through hard rock/heavy metal magazine \"Metal Hammer\" that the title for their third album would be \"Five Serpent's Teeth\" to be released 26 September 2011 in Europe and 18 October 2011 in North America through Earache Records. On 6 June, the band posted a new song, titled \"Eternal Empire\", on their YouTube channel. On 12 September 2011 the album's first single/music video, \"Cult\", was released. The video saw a different, more modern approach. In September/October 2011 the band set out on a 15-date headline tour of the UK with label-mates Savage Messiah (band) as support. The band were then asked by \"Kerrang!\" Magazine to cover a Nirvana song for \"Nevermind\"s 20th Anniversary Tribute Issue. Evile covered the track \"Lounge Act\". Ol Drake commented:\nWhen we got the offer, all I could see was fun to be had, and what an honor it was to be included. I was a big fan of Nirvana when I was a young teen, so it's an extra honor in that way for me. I wondered what we could do to the track to make it our own, so we approached it like we would one of our own songs. That bass riff is brilliant and I wanted to make it more a core element of the track guitar-wise and just metal it up in general. I wanted to respect the approach of the song but also alter Kurt's [Cobain] chord approach to a style more suited to EVILE, and that's a chug-athon!\n\nIn October Evile celebrated the release of \"Five Serpent's Teeth\" by taking part in in-store signing sessions in select Blue Banana stores as well as a short tour of Release Shows in the UK; London, Birmingham and Holmfirth. On 17 October The band were featured in a Live Session on BBC Radio 1's \"Rock Show\" with Daniel P. Carter. The set was recorded at Maida Vale Studios, London. In November Evile announced a 24-date Headlining tour of Europe with Portrait and Dr. Living Dead as supports.\n\nOn 11 February 2012 Evile took part in, and headlined, HMV Group's \"Next Big Thing\" at the HMV Ritz in Manchester, UK along with Cerebral Bore and Savage Messiah. After the death of Woods of Ypres mastermind David Gold, the band decided to make the first live debut of \"In Memoriam\" a dedication to him. \"In Memoriam\" was initially written as a tribute to their fallen bandmate, Mike Alexander. In March 2012, Evile's lead guitarist Ol Drake was nominated for the \"Dimebag Darrell Shredder\" Award as part of Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards. Also up for the award were Devin Townsend, Dino Cazares (of Fear Factory, Russ Parrish), Satchel (of Steel Panther) and Adam Dutkiewicz (of Killswitch Engage). In April 2012 Evile announced they would start filming a music video for the track \"In Memoriam\". Ol Drake commented:\nThe initial idea was to release the \"Cult\" video, as we did, then immediately get onto recording the video for \"In Memoriam\"; this was easier said than done. It's been well documented why the song exists. When it came to getting the \"right\"/\"appropriate\" treatment for the video, it was a lengthy process. The song is so close to all of us that we wanted to make sure the video complemented the song and its subject matter, and that all four of us were happy with how the song will be portrayed visually. If we'd have settled on the first idea after \"Cult\", we wouldn't have been happy, so amidst touring and gigging, we've been working hard on getting this 100% before we move on to the next video. The song is basically about loss, which we can all relate to, so we wanted to express that in the video, while staying respectful to why the song exists. We can't wait to get this filmed and out there for all to enjoy!\n\nOn 31 January 2013, Ol Drake announced via his Tumblr that Evile were to begin recording their fourth album the following weekend. He also confirmed that the band would again utilise producer Russ Russell. On 25 March, Ben Carter and Earache Records released the album name, cover and release date of their fourth album, entitled \"Skull\".\n\nGuitarist Ol Drake announced his departure from Evile in August 2013.\n\nIn August 2014, Evile announced that Piers Donno-Fuller (formerly of Fallen Fate) would be joining them as lead guitarist, and that they \"have something in the pipeline for March\".\n\nAs of March 2016, Evile have been working on their fifth studio album.\n\nOn 19 March 2018, Evile announced the departure of Piers due to personal commitments.\n\nOn April 24 of the same year, the band announced Oliver Drake had rejoined the band.\n\nEvile's sound is primarily influenced by classic thrash metal, citing bands such as Overkill, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Annihilator, Nevermore, Pantera, and Sepultura, though they are also influenced by death metal bands like Obituary.\n\n\n\n"}

In early 2009 he returned to TNA under the ring name Sally Boy, or simply Sal, as one half of The Main Event Mafia's, and later Mick Foley's, personal security force. Sassi trained current AEW wrestler and executive Cody Rhodes.\n\nSassi graduated from Miramar High School in 1988, and turned down academic scholarships in order to train as a wrestler, financing his training through a series of odd jobs, including waiting tables in Hollywood Florida at Napoli's Italian restaurant, formerly run by his father-in-law Paul. Sassi made his wrestling debut on September 30, 1988. In 1990, Sassi appeared with the Nashville-based NWA Worldwide Wrestling.\n\nSassi eventually began wrestling primarily on the Floridian independent circuit, where he formed a tag team with \"Brother\" Dan Evans. Evans and Sassi used the gimmick of a pair of boisterous, prank playing fraternity members. After Evans retired due to injury, Sassi continued to use the gimmick with the third part of the team, Big Tilly. Sassi and Tilly were known collectively as Phi Delta Slam.\n\nSassi also had several matches with World Wrestling Federation from 1994 to 2000. His final and most notable match for the WWF occurred on April 15, 2000 when he lost to Stevie Richards on an episode of \"Jakked\".\n\nPhi Delta Slam were introduced to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) after Dusty Rhodes told his two competing assistants, Traci Brooks and Trinity, to each find a tag team. The tag teams would wrestle one another at Destination X, with the winning tag team's sponsor becoming Rhodes' sole assistant. Trinity selected Phi Delta Slam, and they debuted in February 2005, wrestling dark matches. They made their on-screen debut on March 13 at Destination X, where they lost to Traci's choice, The Harris Brothers. Phi Delta Slam remained in TNA for several weeks afterwards.\n\nTilly and Sassi later made a cameo appearance in a series of comedy segments on the December 20, 2007 episode of \"Impact!\" where they were seen at Eric Young's Christmas party, which also involved the likes of Bushwhacker Butch, Kevin Nash, ODB, and Awesome Kong.\n\nIn early 2009, both Tilly and Sassi returned to TNA as the personal security of The Main Event Mafia in order to help them fend off The TNA Front Line. In order play into the mafia aspect of the stable, Sassi was renamed to Sal (it was later tweaked to Sally Boy), he began wearing sunglasses at all times, dyed his normally blond hair to black and began sporting a short beard. On the March 13 edition of \"Impact!\", Sal and Kurt Angle accompanied Rocco as he wrestled Frontline member Eric Young in the main event, which Rocco lost after Young pinned him following a Death Valley driver. On the April 2 edition of \"Impact!\", Rocco and Sal challenged and lost to Team 3D. On the May 7 edition of \"Impact!\" they were defeated in a handicap match by Matt Morgan. On the May 28 edition of \"Impact!\" Sting, the new leader of the Main Event Mafia, fired Sal and Rocco. On the June 4, 2009, edition of \"Impact!\" Rocco and Sal were hired by Mick Foley. The two of them have since made sporadic appearances as bodyguards.\n\nPhi Delta Slam is currently wrestling with the South Florida-based Coastal Championship Wrestling. In addition, all three members of Phi Delta Slam (Sassi, Tilly and Evans) operate a professional wrestling school called Bodyslam University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Notable graduates include former WWE United States and WWE Tag Team Champion Montel Vontavious Porter.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2275061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275061", "title": "WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth", "text": "WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth\n\nWWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth (Known as Exciting Pro Wrestling 4 in Japan) is a professional wrestling video game released on the PlayStation 2 console by THQ and developed by Yuke's. It is part of the \"WWE SmackDown!\" video game series based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). This game was the sequel to \"WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It\" and was succeeded by \"WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain\". It is also the first game in the series named under the \"WWE\" banner.\n\nSeason mode was lengthened to two in-game years and features the Brand Extension featuring Ric Flair's Raw and Vince McMahon's SmackDown! For the first time, only WWE superstars could participate in \"season mode\". Players compete exclusively on the show they are drafted to for the first few months of year one, consisting of four Raw or four SmackDown! events, plus a monthly pay-per-view (PPV) event. If the player's character is a created superstar, or if the original superstar has a rating lower than 60, he will instead wrestle on \"Sunday Night HEAT\". Eventually, the player will be booked on the two major TV shows, appearing on two Raw and two SmackDown! shows and the PPV event. One of the featured storylines is based on the nWo of early 2002 that included Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and X-Pac (who replaced the released Scott Hall).\n\nLike its predecessor \"WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It\", \"Shut Your Mouth's\" championships cannot be contended for in \"exhibition mode\" and can only be defended in \"season mode\". All of the major titles of the time, except for the WWE Women's Championship, are included in the game: WWE Undisputed, Intercontinental, European, Tag Team, Cruiserweight, and Hardcore championships. Various unlockables such as alternate player attires, extra movesets, and arenas be unlocked through \"season mode\".\n\nTelevised and pay-per-view events are televised from the \"SmackDown! Arena\", the exterior of which is based on Madison Square Garden. Although Jim Ross announces a different city at the start of each event, the exteriors remain the same. Notable areas are a New York City Subway stop named \"SmackDown! Station\", \"Times Square\", and The World. The game features several arenas that WWE held events at in 2001 and 2002. There are also arenas based on each WWE television show. In certain arenas, players could make their wrestlers scale the TitanTron and jump off of it. In addition, The Undertaker's motorcycle could be ridden in some matches. \"Create-A-Superstar mode\" gives the freedom to manipulate any part of the superstar's body. It also offers over 58 move sets from a combination of superstars in WWE not featured in the game or working in different promotions.\n\nThis is the first game to feature superstars on different brands, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\". In this game, all the superstars, including champions are eligible to be drafted on both brands, except for the WWE Undisputed Champion, who is available on both brands, as long as he is the champion. This also marks the first WWE video game appearances of Billy Kidman, Brock Lesnar, Chuck Palumbo, Diamond Dallas Page, Jazz, Maven, Randy Orton, Rico, and Torrie Wilson.\n\nSuperstar models include realistic facial features. Fully animated entrances for each character are featured, with their entrance video playing on the TitanTron, and their respective themes playing in the arena. The title belts are also displayed in the entrances realistically (e.g. The Rock carrying the title belt to the ring and raising it above his head).\n\nFor superstar entrances, most of the themes used in the televised and house shows were incorporated into the game. Along with the in-house music from Jim Johnston, remakes of Johnston's originals from bands such as Breaking Point (for Rob Van Dam), Boy Hits Car (for Lita), Cypress Hill (for Tazz), Our Lady Peace (for Chris Benoit), and Saliva (for The Dudley Boyz) were featured. However, Maven, Stacy Keibler, Tajiri, Randy Orton and The Hardy Boyz do not have their correct themes (although an instrumental version of Maven's actual entrance theme is included on the game disc). Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler provide sporadic commentary while ring announcer Howard Finkel provided his voice for match introductions and superstar entrances.\n\nBy July 2006, the game had sold 1.1 million copies and earned $50 million in the United States. \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 44th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2003 and July 2006 in that country. Combined console sales of \"WWE\" games released in the 2000s reached 8 million units in the United States by July 2006. It also received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n"}
{"id": "2275062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275062", "title": "Vertical Man", "text": "Vertical Man\n\nVertical Man is the 11th studio album by Ringo Starr, issued in 1998. The album served as Starr's attempt at a commercial comeback following the enormous success of \"The Beatles Anthology\" project. Starr enlisted the help of many of his musician friends in making \"Vertical Man\", including Scott Weiland, Brian Wilson, Alanis Morissette, Ozzy Osbourne, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh, Timothy B. Schmit, Steven Tyler, and former Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick mixed the tracks, and Starr and Mark Hudson served as producers.\n\nRingo Starr met songwriter Dean Grakal at a party on New Year's Eve 1996, during which the pair had a discussion about songwriting, with Grakal proposing that they form a team with Mark Hudson, whom Starr had met years prior while Starr was working on \"Time Takes Time\" (1992). Starr spoke of the writing process in an interview with \"Billboard\" magazine: \"This is the first time I've really been involved [in my record]. Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying to say what I would have liked to say, on this, we're really trying to say what I want to say, thank you.\"\n\nIn February 1997, Hudson and Grakal visited Starr in his Beverly Hills residence for a songwriting session. The result of this meeting was a song called \"My Love\", which was promptly renamed to \"Everyday\" after Starr commented that McCartney had already used the title. The song was demoed under that name by Starr, Hudson, Grakal, and guitarist Steve Dudas. Happy with this session, the quartet followed it up with more recordings the following month, at Los Angeles's Whatinthewhatthe? Studios. There the musicians recorded two tracks: \"Mr. Double-It-Up\" and \"One\", the latter of which, per Grakal's lyric sheet, was originally called \"All It Takes Is One\". For these sessions, Starr played the drum set he had used during his time with the Beatles. In mid-to-late April, Starr and Hudson worked on \"Vertical Man\" as Starr began rehearsals for an upcoming tour. Before embarking on the tour (which would begin on 28 April), Starr recorded \"I'll Be Fine Anywhere\". After the tour had finished on 8 June, Starr went on holiday, and returned in July. Recording for the album restarted in the same month, on 20 July, with Starr playing with the Roundheads as his backing band.\nStarr and the Roundheads recorded the tracks \"What in the... World\", \"La De Da\", and \"Mindfield\" on 20 July at Whatinthewhatthe? Studios. Starr added vocals to \"What in the... World\" on 28 July, and two days later to \"Without Understanding\". On July 31, Joe Walsh showed up at Whatinthewhatthe? Studios and added guitar parts to \"What in the... World\", \"La De Da\" and \"Mindfield\". The next day, Starr re-recorded his \"Without Understanding\" vocal. On 5 August, the track \"Old Country Song\" (soon to be re-titled as \"Good News\") was recorded. The bass track to \"Good News\" was recorded two days later, by Lee Rocker. Starr and Hudson then flew to Europe at the end of August.\n\nOn 29 September, at McCartney's The Mill studio, McCartney, Starr, Hudson, Emerick and Paul Wright worked on the track \"La De Da\", which McCartney contributed bass and backing vocals to. This session was filmed by Grakal, and excerpts were later featured in the music video for the song. Also recorded was a new bass track for \"What in the... World\"— replacing the placeholder bass track from a July session. Upon hearing a playback of the track, McCartney remarked \"Whoo ... Rich! Sounds kinda Beatle-ish!\" to which Starr replied \"I know! That's what I said to Mark months ago\". McCartney, now looking at Starr, told him \"You are a fucking Beatle!\" On 15 October, the same day Starr was in Paris to watch McCartney's daughter Stella's fashion show, string overdubs were added on to \"I'm Yours\" and \"King of Broken Hearts\" at AIR Studios, located in London. Starr returned to Los Angeles on 1 November to add overdubs to the latest recorded material, and on 3 November, he recorded \"I Was Walkin'\". On 4 November, \"The Puppet Song\" was recorded. The song had originated from a comment by Starr (\"Put the puppet to bed\"), and would be renamed to \"Puppet\". On 6 November, \"Sometimes\" was recorded, which contained a riff taken from \"Ringo's Rotogravure\"'s (1976) \"Cryin'\".\nOn 7 November, Jeff Baxter overdubbed a steel guitar onto \"One\" and \"Sometimes\". On the same day, Jim Cox added keyboard overdubs to several songs; Starr originally wanted Billy Preston to play the keyboards, but he was in jail at the time. On 11 November at Village Recorder Studios, Baxter also added keyboards to three tracks: \"I Was Walkin'\", \"La De Da\" and \"Sometimes\". Overdubs were added to a number of tracks the following day at the same studio. On 13 November, an ensemble of 45 people—consisting of Starr's friends and family—gathered at Village Recorder Studios to record backing vocals to the track \"La De Da\". The following day, both Schmit and Dave Gibbs added backing vocals to \"Puppet\" and \"Sometimes\". On 17 November, Tyler flew from Amsterdam to Los Angeles to overdub harmonica to both \"I Was Walkin'\" and a re-make of \"Love Me Do\".\n\nThe following day, Tyler re-did his harmonica part to \"Love Me Do\". This was done at Starr's request, who wanted it to sound closer to the Beatles' original version. On 19 November, Alanis Morissette stopped by Whatinthewhatthe? Studios and recorded a vocal for \"Drift Away\". The next day, at Village Recorder Studios, the gospel-choir group Sauce recorded backing vocals for \"\"Without Understanding\" and \"Drift Away\". Brian Wilson, as well as Barbara Bach's cousin, Christian Phillippe Quillici, overdubbed backing vocals to \"Without Understanding\" on 25 November. Wilson dubbed several backing vocal tracks at Hudson's request. On the same day, Morissette added backing vocals to two tracks: \"Mindfield\" and \"I Was Walkin'\". Engineer Eric Greedy made two mixes—one with only vocals, and one of the just the backing tracks—of both \"King of Broken Hearts\" and \"I'll Be Fine Anywhere\". These were sent the next day to Harrison at his Friar Park residence. Up to this point, sixteen tracks in total had been recorded for the album. After arriving in Los Angeles on 30 November, up until 11 December, Geoff Emerick worked on mixing five tracks at A&M Studios (\"One\", \"Mr. Double-It-Up\", \"Everyday\", \"I'm Yours\" and \"What in the... World\"). Also on the 11th, minor mixing was conducted on \"Love Me Do\".\n\nStarr had not paid rent since the beginning of the record sessions. As a result, Nina Pieseckyj—the landlord's secretary—arrived at Whatinthewhatthe? Studios on 12 December to request the rent. Starr immediately asked if she played an instrument, to which she replied \"Yeah, cello\". Starr proceeded to tell her to \"go get it\". Pieseckyj ended up playing a cello riff similar to \"I Am the Walrus\" on the track \"Vertical Man\". Also on this day, Starr was announced to have signed with an EMI subsidiary label, Guardian Records, to release his new album on the planned date of 21 April 1998. On 16 December, a final mix of \"Love Me Do\" was made. A few days after having been signed to Guardian, the label (along with several other minor labels) was shutdown by then-current EMI president Ken Barry, leaving Starr without a label on which to release the album. Upon finding this out, Starr added a final lead vocal track to \"Vertical Man\". All musicians and staff members then took a Christmas break from recording. Harrison's guitar overdubs were sent to Starr via mail and arrived on 22 December, after which he went with the Roundheads to Village Recorder Studios to hear the results. Upon hearing the solos, Starr exclaimed \"You're killing me, George. You've got me crying, you bugger!\".\n\nBetween 6 and 11 January 1998, the tracks \"Mindfield\", \"King of Broken Hearts\" and \"Drift Away\" were mixed at A&M Studios. Osbourne added a vocal track to \"Vertical Man\" on 16 January. The following day at A&M Studios, saxophonist Joel Peskin overdubbed saxophone onto \"Puppet\", which was then mixed on 23 January. On 29 January, Starr and friends listened to a playback of the album. Hudson and Emerick flew to New York on 17 February to oversee mastering of the album. Later that day, Hudson and Grakal met with Mercury's Danny Goldberg, with whom they made a deal to release the album. On 23 April, Starr removed Tyler's vocal at Mercury's request, as Aerosmith was due to have tracks released on the \"Armageddon\" soundtrack. Mastering was handled the next day at Masterdisc by Greg Calbi. Final mastering for the album was done from 2 to 6 May at A&M Studios. On the same day, at Abbey Road Studios, Starr, and Mark and Scott Gordon, via telephone, recorded Petty's (who is assisted by Greedy) vocals for the song \"Drift Away\", who was at Village Recorder Studios in Los Angeles. \"Drift Away\" was remastered, now with Petty's vocals for the song in the mix, on 12 May.\n\nWith the recent \"Beatles Anthology\" having introduced the group to newer and younger fans, it was reasoned that Starr would benefit from the exposure; McCartney's \"Flaming Pie\" had done very well upon its 1997 release. With Starr newly signed to a worldwide major label deal with Mercury, he was hoping for a similar reaction. \n\nOn both 13 and 14 April 1998, Starr held interviews to help promote the album, which was originally to be titled \"Thanks for Comin\"', before being changed after looking through a book belonging to Barbara Bach's daughter, Francesca. On the latter day, a photograph of Starr was taken for the album booklet by Henry Diltz. Starr planned to film a music video for \"La De Da\" at Shea Stadium in New York, though when the scheduled day arrived, filming was disrupted due to rain. As a result, filming moved to the streets of New York City, where Starr was shot sitting on a bench with an umbrella. The video is intercut with Starr and his backing band performing the song, along with footage of McCartney singing the chorus from the previous September. The original plan was for Starr to conduct a crowd singing one verse from \"La De Da\". On 14 May, in the US, Mercury sent out Electronic press kits (EPKs) for the album. On 18 May, \"Entertainment Tonight\" aired an interview with McCartney and Starr that was filmed during the sessions at McCartney's home studio. The \"La De Da\" video first aired on MTV in Europe, on 19 May, while in the US, the video aired on \"Entertainment Tonight\" on 25 May. On 1 June, radio stations were sent promotional copies of the single. A radio special, on 15 June, premiered the album worldwide. Interviews with Starr about the album were printed in both \"New Yorker\" and \"USA Today\" newspapers.\n\n\"Vertical Man\" was released on 16 June in the US, with \"La De Da\" released as a single on 20 July before being withdrawn a week later. Those who pre-ordered the album with Best Buy were given a three-track bonus CD of material not included on the album. Starr also arranged for a digipak edition—limited to 100,000 copies—to be released. The German version of the album included the bonus track \"Mr. Double-It-Up\", while the Japanese edition contained \"Mr. Double-It-Up\" and \"Everyday\". Attendees at the Beatlefest convention who had pre-ordered the album were given a 7\" single of \"La De Da\", which included a non-album track \"Everyday\" as the B-side.\n\n\"Vertical Man\" received average reviews and reached No. 61 in the US. The album was then released in the UK on 3 August, where it bubbled below the official Top 75, reaching No. 85 there, after having sold 2,000 copies. \n\nWithin the album's week of release, Starr held an online chat with fans. A tour followed the release of the album, although Starr said the tour was not only to promote the album: \"I don't really ever want to do the two hours where it's just me. I like the mixture of the All-Stars because it's so much fun.\" On 5 April 1999, Hudson and Gordon made a single edit version of \"La De Da\", which Starr approved on 9 June. Nearly a month later, on 4 July, the single edit aired for the first time on British airwaves, thanks to \"The Chart Show\".\n\n\n"}

He has made many notable contributions to the theory of inner models and determinacy. A type of large cardinal, the Woodin cardinal, bears his name.\n\nBorn in Tucson, Arizona, Woodin earned his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984 under Robert M. Solovay. His dissertation title was \"Discontinuous Homomorphisms of C\"(\"Omega\") \"and Set Theory\". He served as chair of the Berkeley mathematics department for the 2002–2003 academic year.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000.\n\nHe is the great-grandson of William Hartman Woodin, former Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nHe has done work on the theory of generic multiverses and the related concept of Ω-logic, which suggested an argument that the continuum hypothesis is either undecidable or false in the sense of mathematical platonism. Woodin criticizes this view arguing that it leads to a counterintuitive reduction in which all truths in the set theoretical universe can be decided from a small part of it. He claims that these and related mathematical results lead (intuitively) to the conclusion that Continuum Hypothesis has a truth value and the Platonistic approach is reasonable.\n\nWoodin now predicts that there should be a way of constructing an inner model for almost all known large cardinals, which he calls the Ultimate L and which would have similar properties as Gödel's constructible universe. In particular, the Continuum Hypothesis would be true in this universe.\n\n\n"}

His ideas contributed to the early modern consolidation of the religion of Shinto, especially in the form of State Shinto. In his 1825 treatise \"Tenchūku\", Satō argued that the cosmology in the \"Kojiki\" was both indigenous to Japan and the most compatible of all world religions with astronomy. He extended the Western model, however, by arguing that Shinto provided additional explanations for astronomical phenomenon that had not yet been explained by Western astronomy.\n\nSatō advocated an authoritarian government based on Western science and political institutions. In his \"Keizai yōryaku\" (\"The Epitome of Economy\"), he wrote that \"The rationale of economy is to manage the realm, develop goods, make domains affluent, and succor everyone.\"\n\nSatō considered the European great powers to be a threat that Japan needed to counter by radical economic and military reforms, as well as imperial expansion along European lines. His 1823 work \"A Secret Strategy for Expansion（宇内混同秘策）\" called for Japanese world domination, describing how China should be conquered via Manchuria. He suggested that the Japanese government embark on \"colonial and agricultural undertakings\" on uninhabited islands in the South China Sea. He also said that the Japanese government should take the Ryūkyū as a base to attack and capture Luzon Island by surprise, then use Luzon as a base for its \"southward advance\" to seize Java and other places, ultimately spreading its \"military might\" in Southeast Asia. He believed that Japan should \"adopt suitable means of aggression and annexation\" to \"increase its national interests.\" This became the first draft of Japan's \"southward advance\" strategy.\n\n\n"}

He played college football at Florida State and was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He also played for the Philadelphia Eagles, Indianapolis Colts and Dallas Cowboys.\n\nA native of Tallahassee, Florida, Sims attended North Florida Christian High School, where he began his high school football career by earning a varsity letter while only in the eighth grade, a feat not often heard of. A two-way player at running back and linebacker, Sims earned a total of five varsity letters. Playing in Class A, Florida's smallest classification, Sims led the Eagles to four state championships from 1998 to 2001. In his senior year, however, North Florida was eliminated in the region semifinals of the Class A playoffs, losing to Jay 19–14. As a junior, totaled 180 tackles, 41 tackles for loss, 12 sacks and forced seven fumbles on defense and rushed for over 600 yards and 17 touchdowns as a tailback. During his senior year, Sims registered 133 tackles (73 solo stops), 15 tackles for lost yardage, six forced fumbles, seven fumble recoveries and one blocked field goal attempt from his linebacker position and ran for 1,081 yards on 115 carries for 23 touchdowns as a running back.\n\nSims earned All-American honors by \"Parade\" and \"USA Today\". Regarded as a five-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Sims was ranked as the No. 1 inside linebacker in his class. In fact, he was also listed as the No. 1 prospect overall, ahead of Reggie Bush and Whitney Lewis. , Sims remains the only linebacker ranked atop of the \"Rivals\" annual rankings. Recruited by virtually every school in the nation, Sims took official visits to Georgia, Florida, Auburn, Miami (FL), and Florida State. On National Signing Day, Sims chose the Seminoles over the Gators.\n\nAt Florida State, Sims wore #34, a number that was retired in honor of former Seminole football player, Ron Sellers. Sellers gave Sims and the university permission for Sims to wear the jersey number.\n\nIn 2003, as a true freshman at Florida State, Sims played in all 13 games of the season, including the Orange Bowl against Miami (FL), as a back-up outside linebacker. He finished ninth on the team with 42 tackles, and added two tackles for lost yardage, two pass break-ups, three quarterback hurries and a forced fumble. Sims was also one of the Seminoles' top special teams performers. He earned ACC Rookie of the Week for his efforts against Wake Forest, which included a season-high 10 tackles.\n\nAs a sophomore, Sims played in all 12 games, and made the starting lineup by the second week. For his exceptional play on the field in 2004, Sims was named to the second All-ACC team and ESPN named Sims to their first team All-American team. He finished second on the team with a single-season career-high 86 tackles, behind only A. J. Nicholson (88). Sims also recorded a single-season career-high nine tackles for lost yardage, 4.5 quarterback sacks, nine quarterback hurries, five pass break-ups, two forced fumbles and a blocked kick. In three games (North Carolina, Duke, and Florida), Sims recorded double-digit tackles, including a career-high 12 tackles against the Gators. In the Seminoles' 36–3 victory over Virginia, he had nine tackles, a career-high two sacks and a blocked punt. Sims followed that performance with eight tackles, one tackle for lost yardage, a sack and a pass break-up against Wake Forest. Each of those weeks, Sims earned ACC Defensive Back of the Week, as the only player in the ACC to earn the ACC Defensive Back of the Week honors multiple times during the season.\n\nIn July 2005, Sims was arrested on charges of battery and resisting an officer, allegedly shoving his then-girlfriend “repeatedly to the ground” during an argument in the parking lot of a FSU residence hall. Expectations for his junior year were high, as \"The Sporting News\" and other publications named him to their pre-season All-American teams. Sims had a productive, but not spectacular junior season, starting all 13 games, including the Orange Bowl.\n\nSims majored in Environmental Studies at Florida State. In January 2006, Sims announced that he would forgo his senior season to focus on a career in the NFL.\n\nDescribed as a “three-down linebacker who plays bigger than his listed size,” Sims was selected as ninth overall in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. He was the highest selected Seminoles defender since Corey Simon in 2000.\n\nSims was targeted by Lions general manager Matt Millen to bolster the Lions' defense at weakside linebacker. On July 30, 2006, he signed a 5-year, $15.735 million contract with $12.1 million guaranteed. Sims started all 16 games his rookie season at outside linebacker, collecting 124 tackles (81 solo tackles) and was credited with a half sack and one pass deflection. On December 3, against the New England Patriots, Sims had a career-high 13 total tackles. On December 31, Sims made a key tackle on fourth down to give the Lions a big win against the Dallas Cowboys. On September 3, 2007, Sims was named one of five captains for the 2007 Detroit Lions. The Lions former head coach, Rod Marinelli, said that Sims' resembled that of Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Derrick Brooks in his early years, being described as a fast, punishing, sure-tackler.\n\nSims was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles on April 19, 2010 in a three-team trade. The Denver Broncos sent tight end Tony Scheffler and a seventh-round draft pick in 2010 to the Detroit Lions, the Lions sent Sims to the Eagles, and the Eagles sent a fifth-round draft pick in 2010 to the Broncos.\n\nOn August 2, 2011, Sims signed with the Indianapolis Colts as an unrestricted free agent. He wasn't re-signed at the end of the year.\n\nAfter the loss of Sean Lee to injury, on October 24, 2012, the Dallas Cowboys signed him as an unrestricted free agent to provide depth at linebacker. Sims quickly became a starter by his second game (against the Atlanta Falcons) and eventually the unit's defensive play caller, after injuries decimated the position further. He finished the season with 42 tackles, one sack, 2 quarterback pressures and 3 passes defensed. He also recorded 10 tackles in the Cowboys’ emotional week 14 win against the Cincinnati Bengals, a day after the team received news of the death of Jerry Brown and the arrest of Josh Brent.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Sims was signed to a one-year contract at the league minimum salary. He registered 42 tackles, a forced fumble and started 6 games while replacing Bruce Carter, Justin Durant and Sean Lee at different times. He wasn't re-signed at the end of the season.\n\nOn June 3, 2014, Sims signed 1-year deal to replace the suspended Daryl Washington. He was later released on August 7.\n\nKey\n\nOn May 29, 2009, Sims married Brooke McGriff, who is pursuing a degree in Education at Tallahassee Community College.\n\nSims' mother, Alice Sims, formerly Alice Bennett, was an All-American sprinter on the Florida State track and field team from 1980 through 1983. His younger brother, Marcus Sims, a highly regarded high school running back, announced in February 2006 that he will also play his college football at Florida State before transferring to the University of North Alabama . His father Ernie, Sr. was also a running back at Florida State.\n\nSims owns a small collection of animals: 5 dogs and 1 type of reptile. Fox produced a segment for the Lions' game against the Minnesota Vikings in Detroit in 2007 which showcased his pets.\n\nSims currently resides in his home town of Tallahassee, FL, where he owns his own athletic training facility, called Ernie Sims' Big Hits Performance.

Ports for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64 were released simultaneously. It is one of the first batch of five games from Electronic Arts, and EA calls it out as \"truly EA's first game.\" Versions for the Amstrad CPC and IBM PC compatibles (as a self-booting disk) followed in 1984.\n\nThough not a direct clone, \"Hard Hat Mack\" is similar in theme and gameplay to Nintendo's 1981 \"Donkey Kong\" arcade game.\n\nThe player guides a construction worker through a series of goals, making use of open paths, springboards, conveyor belts, and elevators, taking care not to run out of time. Assuming the role of the titular Hard Hat Mack, the player has three lives.\n\nLevel One (building framework). The player must pick up loose girder pieces to fill four gaps in the floor, then capture a moving jackhammer to secure them. At the same time, the player must avoid bolts thrown from above, a wandering vandal and OSHA representative, and falling through gaps or off the edge of the building.\n\nLevel Two (construction site). The player guides Hard Hat Mack through a four-level construction site and collect six lunchboxes guarded by various obstacles. An enemy blocks the final hurdle, requiring a carefully timed jump. Once all the lunchboxes have been collected, the player must guide Mack up a conveyor belt so that an overhead electromagnet pulls him to safety before he can fall into an incinerator.\n\nLevel Three (factory). The player collects six boxes and drops each one into a processor. An enemy moves back and forth near one of the boxes, requiring a very careful jump. The player must avoid falling into a portable toilet at the bottom center of the screen.\n\nAt the completion of a round, the game cycles anew with faster gameplay.\n\n\"Softline\" stated that the Apple version of \"Hard Hat Mack\" \"bears a certain similarity to \"Miner 2049er\", but it's a good game in its own right and the animation is a little better\". \"Video\" also reviewed the Apple version in its \"Arcade Alley\" column where it was described as \"a 'must' buy for Apple arcaders\" and \"indisputably one of the finest programs ever made for the Apple\". Reviewers noted that the game's \"look and play\" were inferior to the Atari version, but this was attributed to the Apple II's systemic limitations and designers Abbot and Alexander were recommended for a \"round of applause\" from readers.\n\nIn 1984 \"Softline\" readers named the game the sixth most-popular Apple program of 1983. \"Computer Gaming World\"s reviewer in 1984 called the game \"a brand new concept in arcade action\", stating that he was unaware of another set in the construction industry. \"PC Magazine\" in 1984 gave \"Hard Hat Mack\" 10.5 points out of 18. It described the game as \"computer game pop art—flashy to the eye, but hollow inside. For all of its nice touches, I quickly became bored.\"\n\nIn late 1983, California state senator Dan McCorquodale, offended by portrayal of OSHA as a villain in the game, sent a complaint letter to an Emporium-Capwell store in Santa Clara, California, accusing the game of being \"anti-worker\" and of skewing the public perception of the federal government. As a result, six days later the store pulled \"Hard Hat Mack\" from the shelves.\n\n\"Amstrad Computer User\" stated the Amstrad CPC version is ″not an outstandingly good game, or an absolutely crummy one either″.\n\nIn 1996, \"Next Generation\" listed \"Hard Hat Mack\" at number 92 in their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\". They judged it the most successful attempt at a platform game for its time, due to the developers' effective execution of a number of elements that have since become mainstays of the platforming genre.\n\n"}

The character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 6 December 1989. He arrived as part of the McDonald family introduced by producer Mervyn Watson along with his twin brother Andy (Nicholas Cochrane) and parents Liz (Beverley Callard) and Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson). For the first year on the Street, the character was credited by the actor's real surname Gregory, before changing to Gregson from early 1991 onwards. Steve is \"Coronation Street\" most married character, having been married seven times to five women. In September 2015, Gregson announced a break due to personal reasons, and Steve was off-screen from November 2015 to 22 April 2016.\n\nSteve's storylines include his many failed relationships: with Vicky Arden (Chloe Newsome), Fiona Middleton (Angela Griffin), Karen Phillips (Suranne Jones), Ronnie Clayton (Emma Stansfield), Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly), Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), as well as Tracy giving birth to his daughter Amy (Elle Mulvaney) and depression. He also has a son, Oliver with Leanne, whom he impregnated whilst his wife Michelle was pregnant with Ruairi. However, Ruairi was stillborn. In 2019, Steve and Tracy struggled to cope when their 14-year-old daughter, Amy, fell pregnant by gang member Tyler Jefferies (Will Barnett). Steve later discovered that hairdresser Emma Brooker (Alexandra Mardell) is actually his biological daughter following his relationship with Fiona, 20 years prior to Emma's arrival in Weatherfield. \n\nSteve arrived in Coronation Street at the age of 15, in December 1989, with twin brother, Andy (Nicholas Cochrane) and parents, Jim (Charles Lawson) and Liz (Beverley Callard). From the start, the lads were high-energy tearaways initially causing aggravation for Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley). Steve and Andy got up to a lot of mischief, including a joyride in an industrial earth mover, breaking Alf's shop window. The lads were brought up mainly by their mother because their father Jim was in the army and away more than he was home. When he was home, the hot tempered Jim, whose tirades were often fuelled by whiskey and beer, had the boys fearing and resenting him. Steve grew up with little respect for his father but a great deal for his mother. It did not stop him from getting into scrapes, no matter how much it worried his mother. Schoolboy pranks turned into illegal activities when Steve was sure he could pull off a scam or two only to find out that the long arm of the law was only a few steps away. Steve was caught selling stolen car radios, and falling into a bad lot which got his brother, Andy, beaten up. Steve ran away with a teenage love to the Lake District and had to be retrieved and defended against Jim by his mother. The McDonalds did not have a lot of money and this seemed to fuel Steve's ambitions, always looking for a way to make money. Steve started working with Jim in a building business but Jim was drinking a lot and during an argument and scuffle on scaffolding, Jim fell into a skip and was paralysed for a time. After Jim's recovery, things started to improve between father and son. They seemed to come to an acceptance of each other. In 2000, he had dealings with a local gangster, Jez Quigley (Lee Boardman). After learning that Jez killed Tony Horrocks (Lee Warburton) and Des Barnes (Philip Middlemiss), Steve decides to testify against him in court. After Jez is found not guilty, he soon plans revenge. He lures Steve into a car park where he is savagely beaten by several of Jez's henchmen. After been found by Jim and taken to hospital, Jim takes revenge by beating Jez. Jez later dies from his injuries after making another attempt on killing Steve. Jim is sentenced to eight year for manslaughter, after this Steve mended his ways.\n\nSteve was married to Karen Phillips (Suranne Jones) twice. During his separation from Karen in 2003, he had a one-night stand with Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), consequently making her pregnant. Tracy gave birth to their daughter Amy (Holly Bowyer and Rebecca Pike), though she initially was named Patience by Roy Cropper (David Neilson) when he was deceived into believing Amy was his daughter. Tracy later decided she wanted to bring up her daughter herself, and revealed that Steve was the baby's father on Steve and Karen's second wedding day. Karen was horrified but later forgave him. Tracy was persistent in causing disruption for Steve and Karen which continued throughout 2004, until Steve ended his relationship with Karen on Christmas Day, admitting it was getting too much for him. In March 2005, he briefly dated single mother Louise Hazel, but the dalliance soon fizzled out partly due to Tracy's presence. For a brief period, he dated Tracy, intending to get parental responsibility for Amy, rather than having feelings for Tracy. Tracy became aware of Steve's scheme and attempted to prevent Steve having access to Amy. The case went to court where Steve was granted legal rights to see his daughter.\n\nSteve starts dating \"StreetCars\" employee Ronnie Clayton (Emma Stansfield), a local gangster's estranged wife. Ronnie tries to frame him when she accidentally ran down a pensioner in her taxi, but she was eventually caught. Steve's alibi for the crime was that he spent the night with his new business partner Lloyd's girlfriend Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu). This led to the temporary closure of Street Cars when Lloyd refused to work with Steve. Lloyd eventually forgave Steve for his deception and they reopened the business. Later that year, Steve bought The Rovers Return pub from Fred Elliott (John Savident) and installed Liz as landlady and stepfather Vernon Tomlin (Ian Reddington) as cellarman. Steve takes Amy (now played by Amber Chadwick) after Tracy is sentenced to 15 years in prison for the murder of her boyfriend Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward).\n\nAfter proposing to Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly), he organises a quick wedding for them. Many people disapprove of them marrying because Becky had been engaged to Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) just before she accepted Steve's proposal. Steve bans Liz and Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) from the wedding after they bet on whether the ceremony would go ahead. In the end, Becky turns up late for the ceremony drunk, rendering her unable to carry out the nuptials. Steve then brings her home in disgrace. The following day, Becky wakes up and, believing that she has been married, hunts for her ring; however, Michelle reveals all in the pub. She later leaves Steve after admitting that it would never work. They later reconcile, and begin plans for another wedding.\n\nSteve and Becky have their second wedding. The ceremony goes off without a hitch, however, their happiness is short lived when The Rovers is searched for drugs, which are found in Becky's bag, having been planted by Becky's ex Slug (Marshall Lancaster). She is arrested and taken to the police cells, however, the charges are later dropped. Steve reveals that he wants another child with Becky, however, she doesn't want any children of her own. This leads to various arguments between the pair. Becky later falls pregnant, leaving the couple without much choice in the matter. She later suffers a miscarriage. After a second miscarriage, Steve and Becky discover that Becky cannot have children and later decide to adopt. Becky and Steve's ex-girlfriend, Tracy, fight at Blanche Hunt's (Maggie Jones) funeral because Becky has become very close to Amy (now played by Elle Mulvaney).\n\nAt an adoption panel meeting, Steve and Becky are told that they have been unsuccessful in their bid to adopt, following a bad reference from Becky's half-sister, Kylie Turner (Paula Lane). Steve is not impressed when Becky moves Kylie into the pub to live with them as she is homeless. On Christmas Eve, Steve and Becky were not happy when Tracy returned. When she entered The Rovers, she managed to insult people and Steve had to reprimand Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) for starting a fight with Tracy where Steve had to restrain Gail. On Christmas Day, Steve very nearly had to remind Gail although it was okay as Tracy and Gail called a truce. Amy revealed to Tracy that Steve and Becky had bought Max (Harry McDermott), Kylie's son. This gave Tracy cause to literally pick Amy up and take her back to No.1 where she says that she was going to ring social services for buying Max. Steve hires a new manager for the pub, Stella Price (Michelle Collins) who moves in there with her daughter Eva (Catherine Tyldesley) and her boyfriend Karl Munro (John Michie). Becky discovers this and is annoyed and goes round the pub to take charge and plays loud music and a fight breaks out resulting in the pub window being smashed. Steve returns and is furious to discover what Becky has done and tells his she does not own the pub any more.\n\nSteve and Becky split up and he begins a relationship with Tracy, after she announces that she is pregnant with his child, who later turn out to be twins. After Lloyd leaves the area, Steve and Becky go into business and decide to extend the business when they meet hotel manager Danny Stratton (Jeremy Sheffield). Tracy assumes that they were having an affair and while searching the hotel for them, she collapses at the hotel and miscarries the babies. However, Steve is told that Becky pushed her down the stairs and caused the miscarriage. Steve is very bitter towards Becky and repeatedly accuses her of killing his unborn children, which she strongly denies. He proposes to Tracy on Christmas Day and he buys No. 13 from Lloyd and they move in and he and Becky get divorced. Steve and Tracy marry but, at the wedding reception in The Rovers, Becky gives Steve a copy of Tracy's medical records, proving that she lied about Becky causing her miscarriage. Steve is disgusted with Tracy and tries to stop Becky leaving with Danny for Barbados but fails and he watches as they board the plane. Steve angrily tells Tracy he wants their marriage annulled and that he loves Becky, not her. Steve's attempts to get the annulment fail as he needs her co-operation and cannot file for divorce for a year. Worse still, he finds himself unable to kick her out of No. 13 as the deeds are in joint names. Unwilling to move out of his own house, Steve remains and tries to persuade Tracy to move out but she won't either so Steve has the house converted into two flats but Tracy threatens to call the council as he didn't apply for planning permission so that is reversed. However, Steve then allows Beth Tinker (Lisa George) and her son, Craig (Colson Smith), to move in with Tracy and Amy. He thought this would make Tracy move out but she ends up becoming friends with Beth so he sells the house to Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) who is looking for somewhere for him and his son after splitting from his wife a few months before. When Steve mentions he needs the house cleaned, Kevin's daughter Sophie (Brooke Vincent) offers and Steve accepts her offer. While Sophie is cleaning, her old friend Ryan Connor (Sol Heras) helps her and while having a cigarette, Steve's curtains are set on fire. Steve and Ryan's mother, Michelle, catch them trying to put out the fire. Afterwards, Kevin tells Steve he isn't interested in buying the house as Steve refused to pay for them.\n\nSteve begins to develop feelings for ex-girlfriend, Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh), and doesn't believe Tracy when she complains that she's ill until she is hospitalised, after collapsing from kidney failure. She tells Steve she still loves him and begs him to stay by her bedside until she wakes up from her sleep. Steve reluctantly does but after helping Michelle deal with Ryan, they share a kiss, unaware that Amy has seen them. Michelle urges Steve to tell Tracy the truth, but he only tells her that he wants to live life on his own. Deirdre came out and furiously told Tracy everything: the kiss and making Amy promise not to say anything, and Tracy is heartbroken. The next day, Steve explained everything to Tracy, saying that nothing has changed between them and he loves Michelle. Tracy tells Steve he's being a fool, but all she got back was an apology for not being honest with her earlier. Steve and Michelle move into 4b Victoria Court. In September 2013, Stella puts The Rovers up for sale, and Steve decides to put an offer down to cheer up Michelle, who is down in the dumps at the moment. Although she is angry that he kept it a secret, she eventually comes round to the idea of being the landlady, and is given a 50% share of the place. When Liz returns, she is given the role of assistant manager and is seen behind the bar more often than Steve and Michelle. The reason for this is that Steve still has his taxi-firm business, \"StreetCars\" and is struggling to cope with running two businesses. Michelle advise Steve to sell his share of the taxi-firm to his friend and current business partner, Lloyd, which he agrees to.\n\nIn December 2013, when Michelle's friend, Carla Connor (Alison King), marries Steve's friend, Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), Steve and Michelle help plan the wedding, which prompts them to begin a party planning business together. However, a few months later, Steve is shocked to discover that Peter is having an affair with Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). When the truth is revealed, Carla says that she is going to kill Tina and is prime suspect in her murder investigation when she is found lying dead on the pavement. When Michelle discovers that Steve knew about Tina and Peter's affair, she dumps him, packs her bags and moves in with Carla. However, they get back together within a week and begin to save up for a holiday home in Spain.\n\nIn January 2015, Steve is diagnosed with clinical depression and not wanting Michelle to have to cope with him, he decides to end their relationship without giving her any explanation. This leads Michelle to believe that he does not love her anymore. Whilst driving the \"Underworld\" staff to an awards' ceremony for Carla to accept an award, Steve is chased by some boy racers who eventually cut him up and cause him to swerve. Steve crashes the minibus, leaving the staff trapped in the wreckage. Steve is the first person to awaken from unconsciousness, and wanders off to leave the others to deal with the traumatic situation. Whilst at the hospital, Steve tells Michelle that he has depression and that this is the reason why he ended their relationship. Michelle promises to help him recover.\n\nIn March 2015, Michelle discovers that Steve owes £10,000 in tax which Steve had been ignoring for the past few months. Liz's boyfriend, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard) offers to lend him the money to clear his debt, but after starting an affair with Tracy, the couple plan to take the Rovers from the McDonald's so Tony lies to Steve and tells him that he needs his money back to pay off some loan sharks. Subsequently, Steve proposes to Michelle in the back room of The Rovers. However, Steve is convinced that Michelle doesn't really want to marry him, and only said yes out of pity, so he calls off the engagement. Later, Steve finds a candlelight dinner prepared in the back of The Rovers, and he assumes that Tony has prepared the meal for Liz, and calls Tony out in front of a busy pub at the Butler Auction. Michelle then confesses that it was actually her who had prepared it for both of them, and calls Steve up onto the stage to explain that she had said yes to him because she loves him. Michelle then proposes to Steve, getting the engagement back on track.\n\nIn May 2015, after some persuasion from Liz, a reluctant Steve agrees to sell his share of the Rovers to a company called \"Travis Limited\", who, unbeknownst to everyone, is actually Tony. Tony then persuades Liz into selling her share of the pub to Travis Ltd, in order to start a new life in Spain. However, Michelle's best friend Carla steps in and offers to buy Liz's share of the pub, which not only settles Michelle's worries about being kicked out of their home, but Liz accepts asking Tony why it would be better to sell to a stranger rather to someone that they know and trust. Carla then promises to keep Steve and Michelle as the pub managers. On 26 May 2015, after a total of seven years of an on-and-off relationship, Steve and Michelle finally marry.\n\nSteve leaves to stay with Andy for a while in Spain, he later returns for Michelle's birthday. Steve is furious with Michelle when he learns that she kissed an ex-boyfriend, Will Chatterton (Leon Ockenden). Michelle plans to leave for a job on a cruise ship when her attempts to get Steve to forgive her fail. Steve and Michelle later reconcile. Steve has sex with Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) and she becomes pregnant. Steve told Liz that he got Leanne pregnant and explain it was one night stand that he thought Michelle had gone to cruise ship. Leanne informs Steve of her intention to keep the unborn child. Steve decides to keep his involvement a secret and having nothing to do with the unborn child. Michelle then expresses an interest of having children of their own. Steve agrees to have a baby after speaking to Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin). Michelle then also falls pregnant, but unfortunately delivers their baby boy, Ruairi, at 23 weeks. The baby doesn't survive, leaving both Michelle and Steve devastated. Michelle then finds out that Leanne's baby, Oliver, is Steve's baby, after their one-night stand, Michelle then leaves Steve for good, unable to forgive him. Steve finds out that Michelle is now in a relationship with Tracy's ex-husband, Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) to his dismay. Michelle then begins a relationship with Robert and divorces Steve. He then tries to make a go of things with Leanne, so they can be a family, due to them having Oliver. Steve proposes and Leanne accepts. They both later realise their relationship won't work as they don't love one another, but agree to be friends. Steve then starts dating Tracy again, despite the disapproval of Liz and Amy. Steve and Tracy eventually remarry.\nAfter the New Year, Amy tells both Steve and Tracy that she is pregnant at 14 years old which horrifies Steve, leading him to accuse Aadi Alahan (Zennon Ditchett) and Amy's step-cousin Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) of impregnating her. However it was shortly revealed that Simon's arch enemy Tyler Jefferies (Will Barnett) is the biological father. After learning Tyler is 17 years old, Steve realises Tyler could legally go to prison for having sex with a minor. However Steve does the right thing by Amy and does not take legal proceedings.\nBoth Tracy and Tyler pressure Amy into having an abortion, but Amy is adamant that she wants to keep the baby. Steve and Tracy supports her decision, but also decides to adopt her baby and raise it as their own.\n\nSimon Gregson began his time in \"Coronation Street\" at the age of fifteen in 1989, when he and Nicholas Cochrane were selected to play the teenage twin sons of a new family in The Street. Whilst filming with the soap opera he filmed a guest appearance for the comedy series Red Dwarf, alongside fellow actor Craig Charles (who plays the lead character in the comedy). Craig Charles has played Lloyd Mullaney in Coronation Street since 2005. In September 2015, it was announced that Gregson had taken an extended break from the show for \"personal reasons\" and that Steve would be off-screen for several months. He would also not appear in the upcoming live episode, but would feature in the episodes either sides of it. Steve departed in November 2015, but returned in April 2016.\n\nAfter Steve breaks up with Vicky Arden (Chloe Newsome), he decides to pursue Fiona Middleton (Angela Griffin). Gregson reckoned she was a good match for his character, as he needed someone he could have a good time with and who shared his interests. He also wanted someone who was not looking for a serious relationship. Gregson described Fiona as a female version of Steve, and said \"She's a real woman of the Nineties who knows what she wants. She's also pretty streetwise, which Steve loves.\" Steve and Fiona's relationship is strained when Fiona becomes fed up of playing hard to get, and then shows him up at a party. Griffin said Fiona is giving Steve \"a run for his money\" and that he is not sure how to react, as he has never met someone like her before. The actress also said that Steve treated Vicky badly, and Fiona will not put up with the same behaviour, which is why she was angry that he treated her as \"an unpaid skivvy\" at his party.\n\nWhen Fiona meets Steve's ex-girlfiend Vicky, she immediately sees her as a threat to her relationship. Steve carries on gambling and it becomes clear that Vicky still has feelings for Steve. Vicky discovers that Fiona and Steve's relationship has been difficult despite them deciding to move in together. Steve promises to stop gambling but when he learns that Vicky has inherited £240,000, he gets back with her. Griffin believed that Fiona was actually more annoyed at Steve for flaunting his relationship with Vicky in her presence than losing him. She concluded \"I reckon she's had a pretty lucky escape.\"\n\nSteve began a relationship with Karen Phillips, played by Suranne Jones. Rick Fulton of the \"Daily Record\" noted that Karen vows to be more \"wily\" with her romantic interests after seeing her friend Bobbi \"wrapping boyfriend Vikram Desai (Chris Bisson) around her little finger\". Her friend and colleague Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) makes a series of bets with Karen regarding how new boyfriend Steve treats her: this culminates in Janice betting Karen that she can get Steve to propose to her. Of the storyline, Jones stated that: \"Karen can't believe she's on the verge of getting married for a bet\". She characterises Karen as \"not the type of girl to back out of a tricky situation\" and states that she and Steve find themselves \"in a game of bluff\" with each \"waiting for the other to pull out.\" Gregson felt the marriage was \"quite fitting\" and that his character \"thinks it's a bit of a laugh\". The wedding scenes were filmed on 6 May 2001 and screened on 30 May 2001. Billy Sloan of the \"Sunday Mail\" stated that the scenes were \"guaranteed to provide a bit of light relief\" after serious storylines such as Toyah Battersby's (Georgia Taylor) rape and Alma Halliwell's (Amanda Barrie) cervical cancer diagnosis. Jones felt that Steve was \"definitely the man for Karen\" as the two characters had \"similar personalities\". She stated that Karen had dumped her previous boyfriend, Vikram, because he \"wasn't racy enough and doesn't have the edge Steve has\".\n\nIn September 2001, Jones stated that she \"[feels] sorry for Steve sometimes\" in regard to Karen's negative characteristics. She indicated that she'd \"love to see Steve and Karen having the same impact on viewers as Dirty Den and Angie did\". In November 2001, the two characters fall out because Karen insults Steve's mother Liz, though they later end up back together. Discussing the success of the pairing, Gregson compared Steve and Karen to \"a mini Jack and Vera\" with \"the shouting and the arguments\" and \"the feistiness of the characters\". He added that Steve and Karen \"can't live with each other and can't live without each other\". Gregson also remarked that the relationship was \"going back to what \"Coronation Street\" set out to be\" which he felt to be \"hen-pecked husbands and very strong women\".\n\nSteve embarked on an affair with fellow resident Becky Granger, portrayed by Katherine Kelly. Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), stating: \"Both boys bring out different things in Becky. With Jason, they liked going clubbing, and it was no strings attached, I think Becky needs more than that, even though she wouldn't admit it. I think, long-term, Steve's better for her.\" When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website \"Digital Spy\", he was asked if he thought that Steve has had a positive impact on Becky's life. In reply he stated: \"I think he's turned it around. She was all over the place getting into trouble all the time but he's made her grow up. And having a little girl there in Amy, that's made her grow a bit, too. She's got responsibilities now. She's besotted with him. She's still a total pisshead, though!\" Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009, their first wedding was given a promotional push from \"ITV\" who aired adverts for the first wedding episodes. Their relationship was featured in a series of romantic plots which \"ITV\" dubbed the \"Summer of Love\" season of the soap, with advertisements airing.\n\nIn 2014, Producer Stuart Blackburn revealed that Steve's depression storyline was going to be a big storyline, stating: \"It's going to run through the autumn and build up from there. On Christmas Day and beyond, we'll see a real challenge to Steve and Michelle's relationship. I absolutely know that Simon Gregson and Kym Marsh are very good actors. I hope that the great comedy that Steve brings will absolutely be on screen for the next decade and onwards, but I also wanted to explore a story where Steve looked in the mirror on his 40th birthday and started to wonder whether he was really good enough for Michelle. He also blamed himself for Lloyd's heart attack and he feels guilty for his role in what happened to Tina. Steve is taking a long, hard look at himself and he's not liking what he sees. It's going to run from there, and there will still be comedy in the lead-up as Steve tries to hide away from the demons in his head. Fundamentally what I wanted to do is tell what will hopefully be a really positive, uplifting love story between Michelle and Steve.\"\n\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that Steve would reunite Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) in the aftermath of the upcoming mini bus crash storyline. It was also confirmed that Steve and Michelle would be the next Weatherfield couple to tie the knot. Speaking of this Marsh said; \"I'm delighted, absolutely delighted. It'll be weird after being Michelle Connor for nearly nine years, but it totally makes sense for us as characters. Simon and I love working together, and nobody likes to see us broken up.\" It was also revealed that Michelle would get \"feisty\" again when her Steve is blamed for the mini-bus crash.\n\nMarsh also revealed that Michelle and Steve's mother, Liz, would clash over the best course of action for Steve. With Michelle now focused solely on helping Steve to get better with his depression following their reconciliation, she faces opposition from his mother Liz as it becomes apparent that they have very different approaches. While Liz adopts a \"tough love\" approach with her son, Michelle thinks they should tread more carefully around him, worried about his vulnerable state. Marsh said: \"They both obviously want to help Steve but because both of them are so worried about him and love him so much - they both want to help him in their own way. Understandably they clash as they're both so concerned about him. They both have different approaches - Liz is more of the tough love approach and tries to get Steve up and doing things, whereas Michelle is much more trying the softly-softly approach.\" Marsh added: \"Liz doesn't think it's the best way because Michelle is so protective of Steve and doesn't want to hurt or upset him. After everything that's happened with the crash, Michelle thinks they should go easy on him.\" Despite the disagreement, Marsh believed that the pair would be able to put their differences aside eventually in order to work together to help Steve.\n\nIn June 2016, it was announced Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) would fall pregnant following a one-night stand. The father was revealed as Steve. Gregson said that his character may have gone \"a step too far\" and that \"he has to keep Michelle\". Marsh added that her character would \"make Steve's life hell\" if she found out. Danson said Leanne and Michelle will also be \"forced\" to be friends after Michelle finds out she is pregnant with Steve's child, and that \"it's just really awkward\". Danson also stated that Leanne wants to forget the McDonalds and raise the child with Nick. Liz also finds out, and Gail is \"thrilled when she finds out\" and that the situation, \"It's like a little pressure cooker, it's all waiting to blow\". Danson also says the storyline \"provokes a lot of stories for a lot of other characters and it's how they will deal with the repercussions\". Steve being the father will have implications on Leanne and Nick's relationship and a spark a rivalry between Steve and Nick. Producer Kate Oates said \"Nick is persistent and Nick adores her\" and the storyline will see if they can overcome Leanne being pregnant with another man's child.\n\nA four-part spin-off series entitled \"Street Car Stories\" was released in February 2014 and featured comic scenes between Steve and Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) in the Street Cars cab office.\n\nSteve McDonald has proven to be one of the most popular characters on the \"Street\" in recent years due to high-profile storylines, such as his dodgy dealings with Jez Quigley and his explosive relationships with Karen McDonald and Tracy Barlow. At the 2004 \"Inside Soap\" Awards, the Tracy/Steve baby secret won the 'Best Storyline' gong. The presence of the McDonald family on \"Coronation Street\" and Steve in particular have been singled out for praise. Critic Tony Stewart praised the episodes in which Steve discovered that Lloyd and Liz were having a fling, calling it \"pure comedy gold, full of wicked laugh-out-loud one-liners...\" Ian Wylie has been very impressed with Simon Gregson's performance as Steve saying, \"his on screen performance remains as fresh as the day he started\".\n\nOver the years, storylines involving Steve McDonald have received some negative backlash. In 2002, the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised \"Coronation Street\" for being \"unacceptably menacing\" in regard to the hospital scene where Steve was threatened by Jez Quigley, broadcast two years previously. A spokeswoman for the soap defended the controversial storyline saying; \"We are a realistic drama and we did flag up the fact there was going to be violence in the Steve McDonald episode. We are mindful that \"Coronation Street\" has a large family audience and endeavour to appeal to young and old at all times.\"\n\nIn February 2009, Steve McDonald was voted the nation's favourite soap character in a poll conducted by \"The People\" newspaper. Talking about the victory Gregson stated; \"Oh my God, I am chuffed. I'm delighted people enjoy watching Steve and the scrapes he gets into. And I'm pleased people like to watch him as much as I love playing him.\"\n\nGregson was nominated in the category of \"Best Actor\" at The British Soap Awards 2011. He won the \"Funniest Male\" award at the 2013 Inside Soap Awards. He also won \"Best Comedy Performance\" at The British Soap Awards 2014. In August 2017, Gregson was longlisted for Best Actor and Funniest Male at the Inside Soap Awards, while the death of Steve and Michelle's son was longlisted for Best Show-Stopper and Steve revealing himself as Oliver's father was longlisted for Best Shock Twist. While Steve revealing himself as Oliver's father did not make the shortlist, Gregson's three other nominations did. Gregson did not win any awards at the ceremony.\n\n"}

{"id": "2275128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275128", "title": "The Smart Set", "text": "The Smart Set\n\nThe Smart Set was an American literary magazine, founded by Colonel William d'Alton Mann and published from March 1900 to June 1930. During its Jazz Age heyday under the editorship of H.L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan, \"The Smart Set\" offered many up-and-coming authors their start and gave them access to a relatively large audience. Its headquarters was in New York City.\n\nIn 1900, American Civil War veteran and financier Colonel William d'Alton Mann sought to offer a cultural counterpart to his gossip magazine \"Town Topics\", an infamous publication which he used for political and social gain among New York City's elite. Mann purportedly used his \"Town Topics\" investigators to gather embarrassing information about wealthy individuals in New York Society and would allow these individuals to suppress the articles in exchange for monetary remuneration. This questionable practice led many historians to suggest the latter magazine functioned more or less as a means for Mann to collect blackmail:\n\nWhen conceiving his new publication entitled \"The Smart Set\", Mann wished to include works \"by, for and about 'The Four Hundred',\" referring to Ward McAllister's claim that there were only 400 fashionable people in New York's upper society. As a so-called \"pasha of the Gilded Age,\" Mann sought to provide sophisticated content that would reinforce the social values of New York's social elite. As such, Mann initially sought out those writers who were supposedly \"from the ranks of the best society of Europe and America.\" Mann gave his new publication the subtitle \"The Magazine of Cleverness.\"\n\nMann published the first issue of \"The Smart Set\" on March 10, 1900, under the editorship of young poet Arthur Grissom, who had also worked on \"Town Topics\". As editor, Grissom created the formula of the magazine that would remain intact throughout the greater part of its existence: 160 pages containing a novelette, a short play, several poems, and witticisms to fill blank spaces. Its first cover, by Kay Womrath, \"depicted a dancing couple in evening dress controlled by strings held by a grinning Pan; the slashing S's of the title were in vermilion. The price was twenty-five cents.\" Its earliest contributors included celebrated poets Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Bliss Carman and Clinton Scollard. \n\nGrissom was the first editor to publish works by O. Henry in \"The Smart Set\", and O. Henry's short story, \"The Lotos and the Bottle\", was published by Grissom \"at the bargain rate of fifty dollars [in] quick cash.\" However, after a very brief tenure as editor, Grissom died of typhoid fever in December 1901, and novelist Marvin Dana took over as editor, in the first of a series of managerial turnovers that would define the evolution of magazine until its termination. Dana formed an editorial triumvirate consisting of himself and two associate editors, Charles Hanson Towne and newspaper correspondent Henry Collins Walsh. Dana remained as editor until 1904, when he left \"The Smart Set\" to work in newspapers. Dana's chosen successor was Towne, previously an editor at \"Cosmopolitan Magazine\". Towne was the magazine's first editor to actively push to publish new literary talents such as James Branch Cabell. He also oversaw a stable of famous contributors such as Jack London, Ambrose Bierce and Theodore Dreiser. Under Towne's editorship, the \"Smart Set\" honed its tone and content:\n\nBy 1905, the magazine reached its peak circulation of 165,000. However, as a result of allegations of blackmail associated with Mann's \"Town Topics\" in 1906, \"The Smart Set\"'s popularity began to precipitously decline, and it immediately lost around 25,000 readers. Dissatisfied with the magazine's direction, Towne resigned his position as editor in 1908 to work with Theodore Dreiser on \"The Delineator\", an American women's magazine. \n\nAfter Towne's departure, Colonel Mann stepped up as editor alongside Fred Splint, and the two quickly set out to revitalize the magazine in order to rebuild its readership. As part of this revitalization, Mann started a monthly book review column and, in 1908, Splint hired the Baltimore newspaperman Henry Louis Mencken to fill the book reviewer position at the suggestion of editorial assistant Norman Boyer. The twenty-eight-year-old Mencken quickly became quite popular with readers as his \"oracular, pungent, and racy\" book reviews garnered much attention. Using his position as book reviewer for \"The Smart Set\", Mencken would become \"America's most important literary and social critic.\" \n\nSoon after, in 1909, George Jean Nathan became the magazine's drama columnist. During his tenure as the \"Smart Set\"'s resident theater critic, Jean \"would become an extremely influential figure in the New York drama scene.\" Nathan \"matched Mencken in his defiance of conventional mores, his saucy style, [and] his magisterial attitude.\" Together, the combined criticisms of Mencken and Nathan elevated the substantive content of Mann's magazine to appeal to intellectuals and ensured the magazine's place in literary history.\n\nWith \"The Smart Set\" in perpetual decline, Mann sold the magazine in Spring 1911 to John Adams Thayer for $100,000. Thayer, a self-made millionaire who had \"made a personal fortune as a successful advertising manager at the Ladies' Home Journal.\" Thayer, who previously pulled the muckraking \"Everybody's Magazine\" out of a slump and earned himself a significant fortune from its sale, hoped ownership of \"The Smart Set\" would allow him entrance into the social ranks of New York's high society. However, the magazine's ruined reputation made this difficult and his purchase left him in charge of a sinking ship. \n\nAfter Mencken and Nathan both declined the offer of editorship, Thayer assumed the position of editor-in-chief and appointed the magazine's Associate Editor, Norman Boyer, as Managing Editor. An expert in advertising, Thayer added a slogan to the magazine's subtitle, stating that \"Its Prime Purpose is to Provide Lively Entertainment for Minds That Are Not Primitive.\" The new slogan was unsuccessful in restoring the magazine's reputation and popularity, but in 1912 a younger, more rebellious audience began reading \"The Smart Set\" for that very reason. To accommodate this new demographic, Thayer, at the recommendation of Mencken, handed over the editorship to Willard Huntington Wright in 1913. Wright was a Harvard graduate and had served as the literary editor of \"The Los Angeles Times\". Wright outlined the magazine's new editorial direction in the next month's issue:\n\nAlthough only lasting a year, Wright's tenure marked a period of artistic prosperity for \"The Smart Set\". Thayer, undoubtedly regretting the decision later, appointed Wright as editor with complete control of the magazine's content and direction. Wright, immediately taking advantage of this position, began collecting manuscripts from new artists and hired Ezra Pound as an overseas talent scout. With an appreciation for new and unconventional literary styles, Wright steered the magazine into publishing more experimental and \"avant-garde\" literary works by authors such as D.H. Lawrence, Joseph Conrad, William Butler Yeats, and Ford Madox Ford.\n\nPredictably, Wright's editorial decision caused a drastic reduction in readership and angered the magazine's advertisers, who began withdrawing financial backing. Additionally, Wright was using \"The Smart Set\"'s checkbook to overpay authors for their work and was attempting to secretly fund a prototype of a more radical publication with Mencken. As a result, Thayer fired Wright in 1914 and announced an end to the magazine's \"avant-garde\" content and a return to more traditional material. By the end of Wright's editorship, however, the magazine was in economic disrepair, and Thayer handed over ownership to Colonel Eugene Crowe in return for forgiveness of debts.\n\nNevertheless, due to the fired Wright's editorial decisions, the magazine had acquired a new intellectual audience. Their readership included such notable authors as \"Theodore Dreiser, Ezra Pound, Sinclair Lewis, Hugh Walpole, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway; such university professors as Stewart Sherman and Percy Boynton; and a number of prominent journalists and critics, including Edmund Wilson, Burton Rascoe, Alfred Kazin, Franklin Pierce Adams and Harold Ross,\" the co-founder of \"The New Yorker\" magazine who was inspired to create the latter publication upon the demise of \"The Smart Set\".\n\nHaving little interest in running a magazine, Crowe gave control of \"The Smart Set\" to Eltinge Warner, who then appointed Mencken and Nathan as co-editors with total artistic control. Warner remained in control of the magazine's accounts—circulation, advertising, and bookkeeping—while Mencken and Nathan focused on literary content.\n\nIn a series of measures to economize, Mencken and Nathan relocated the magazine's office to a smaller location and reduced the staff, retaining only themselves and a secretary, Sara Golde. Additionally, Warner reprinted previous issues of \"The Smart Set\" under the title \"Clever Stories\". In their most successful effort to boost revenue, Mencken and Nathan began the pulp magazine \"The Parisienne\" in 1915 as a place to publish a surplus of manuscripts they deemed inferior for \"The Smart Set\". \"The Parisienne\" \"capitalized on the then current war interest in France\" generated significant profits, which they used to offset the production costs of \"The Smart Set\". The co-editors sold \"The Parisienne\" to Warner and Crowe in 1916 and repeated the process with \"Saucy Stories\" and, in 1920, \"Black Mask\".\n\nMencken and Nathan's co-editorship helped to bring about a golden era for new literature and \"The Smart Set\". Together, they \"created a uniquely liberated mass-market venue for American fiction; this fact alone suggests the importance of this magazine inrelation to American literary developments in the teens and early twenties.\" Circulation during their co-editorship was between 40,000 and 50,000, making it one of the most far-reaching venues for literature of the period. Mencken and Nathan cultivate a youthful readership who had grown increasingly restive and disillusioned with America in the aftermath of The Great War. During these years, \"Mencken constantly exhorted his fellow critics and literary historians to provide realistic appraisals and re-evaluations of our [American] cultural past, which would then, he felt, influence the present.\"\n\nDuring this time the magazine featured works by Edna St. Vincent Millay, Theodore Dreiser, Aldous Huxley, Sinclair Lewis, Benjamin De Casseres, Eugene O'Neill and Dashiell Hammett, among others. In May 1915 \"The Smart Set\" published two stories from James Joyce's \"Dubliners\", the first time Joyce's work appeared in an American publication. The magazine introduced F. Scott Fitzgerald in September 1919, when it published his short story \"Babes in the Woods\". In addition to introducing new literary talent, the two editors were renowned social critics, who lampooned virtually every facet of American culture. Although they were known for their satire, their increasingly controversial material became the reason for their departure from \"The Smart Set\" and would set in motion the end of the magazine itself.\n\nMencken and Nathan's editorship at \"The Smart Set\" came to an end after they planned to run a satirical piece on President Warren G. Harding following his death. Harding died in August 1923. His funeral procession involved transporting the body across the country from San Francisco to Ohio. The mainstream media began to sentimentalize the procession, to the dismay of American intellectuals, who noticed a hypocritical change in the press's attitude. Among the dissatisfied were Mencken and Nathan. The two co-editors planned to run a satirical piece on the president's funeral, treating the president in death as they did in life. However, the magazine's printers noticed the piece and reported its contents to an incensed Warner. Considering the piece to be a form of treason, Warner demanded that the editors remove it, and in a rage, announced that he was selling the magazine. Warner's removal of their satirical piece marked the end of the editors' \"carte blanche\" over the magazine's content, and they sought the freedom and control over their own publication. Upon leaving, Mencken and Nathan began a collaboration with the publishing magnate Alfred A. Knopf and started \"The American Mercury\".\n\nBefore leaving \"The Smart Set\" Mencken and Nathan recommended Morris Gilbert to replace them as editor. Reportedly, Gilbert had no idea that Warner was planning to sell the magazine upon accepting his position as editor. Under the editorship of Gilbert, the magazine's attitude and content reverted to the days before Mencken and Nathan's (or even Wright's) time as editors. However, Gilbert's position as editor was short-lived. In 1924, Warner sold the magazine to the publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who immediately gave editorial control to George D'Utassey. Unable to cope with the new management, Gilbert resigned soon after.\n\nHearst's ownership of the magazine brought about an editorial focus on commercialism and superficial moral themes. As the magazine's new editor, D'Utassey reversed the artistic headway that Mencken and Nathan had established for the magazine and changed the subtitle to \"True Stories from Real Life.\" Under D'Utassey the magazine veered away from unconventional literature and satire. Although (or perhaps because) the content changed, Hearst's ownership led to huge profits, and circulation grew to 250,000 in 1925. \n\nIn 1929 the magazine merged with Hearst's newly acquired \"McClure's\" to form \"The New Smart Set\", under the editorship of Margaret Sangster. Under Sangster, the magazine became a publication targeted towards young women and was given a new subtitle, \"The Young Woman's Magazine.\" However, following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the magazine was unable to survive the economic slump. It ceased publication in June 1930.\n\nIn 1934, some of the best pieces from the magazine were gathered in \"The Smart Set Anthology\", published by Reynal & Hitchcock. In 2007, Drexel University launched an online cultural journal titled \"The Smart Set\". Drexel's journal shares some ideals with the original \"Smart Set\" and lists Owen Hatteras, a pen name used by H.L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan of the original journal, on its masthead, but its connection to Mencken and Nathan's magazine is unofficial.\n\n\n"}

She was the sixth ship (and second cruiser) of the French Navy to be named after Jean-Baptiste Colbert (the previous one was scuttled at Toulon in 1942). She served in the Navy from 1956 to 1991, before being converted into a museum ship at Bordeaux from 1993. \"Colbert\" was scrapped in 2016.\n\nHer construction began in the Brest dockyards in 1953. She was designed as a powerful ship, the second of the \"De Grasse\" series, able to overcome all threats solely by her guns' weight of fire - she had 57 mm and 127 mm turrets for a firing rate of one shot per second. Launched on 24 March 1956 in Brest, France, starting her trials on 5 December 1957 and officially entering active service on 5 May 1959, she was made part of a 15-ship squadron, with the main aims of protecting aircraft carriers from air attack, shore bombardment for ground operations, command hub for naval operations and evacuating French expatriates from overseas. In 1964 a naval reorganisation made her the flagship of France's Mediterranean squadron (\"escadre de Méditerranée\") at Toulon, which was mainly made up of complementary units such as aircraft-carriers and frigates.\n\nHer role as a foreign representative of France was important. In 1961 she repatriated the remains of Marshal Hubert Lyautey and she ferried General De Gaulle both on his 1964 South American tour and on his June–July 1967 official visit to Canada (the latter trip was the occasion of his famous \"Vive le Québec libre!\" speech - the diplomatic row which followed put an end to the trip). During the Atlantic crossing on board \"Colbert\" De Gaulle signed a number of decrees, such as n°67-611 (23 July 1967, on interpreters in the army reserve) and n°67-612 (on interpreters in the naval reserve). \"Colbert\" also represented France at the bicentennial festivities in Australia in 1988.\n\nBuilt too late, \"Colbert\" was superseded at the end of the 1960s by a new generation of ships better adapted to new threats. Her big-gun-based armament had become obsolete and inefficient against supersonic attack aircraft and thus between 1970 and 1972 she underwent extensive modifications in Brest to become a missile cruiser, with a double ramp of Masurca surface-to-air missiles. She once again became flagship for the Mediterranean squadron from 1976, but her duties from then on were mainly humanitarian or representative - Agadir in 1960 and the evacuation of Bizerte in 1961. She gained a reputation within the French Navy as a ship that had never fired a single shot in anger, with her only ever active service being in the 1991 Gulf War (operation \"Salamandre\") a few months before she was decommissioned on 24 May that year.\n\nBetween June 1993 and 2007, she was a museum and monument historique in the port of Bordeaux. During 2004 she was France's most-visited museum ship and the city's most-visited historic attraction. She was a private museum, belonging to the state but with the museum's running handed over to \"The Friends of the Colbert\" association. A visit lasted between two and three hours, with guided visits given access to parts of the ship closed off to the public, such as the engine rooms and cabins. The ship also housed several permanent exhibitions on the Navy, Météo-France and architectural models (in which one could see modellers at work). The ship's siren went off at midday every Wednesday and Sunday. A covered restaurant and dance-room was built on her foredeck, served by the ship's former kitchens. A \"Colbert\" stop on the quay by the ship was even planned on the city's tramway, allowing faster access to or from the city centre and thus increase visitor numbers, whilst the ship's presence led to the quays becoming highly developed.\nHowever, the museum ship also had its critics in the city, such as those living by the quays (a \"Let's Sink the Colbert\" association even fielded a candidate in the municipal elections of 1995), and the ship also got into recurring financial problems - despite being the owner, the state did not pay its maintenance costs necessary to keep up the ship's security and image (to completely repaint the ship, for example, cost more than 500,000 €, too high a price for the museum's budget). Under pressure from the Mairie of the city and local associations, and without other funding forthcoming, the museum ship closed to the public on 2 October 2006.\n\nShe was towed on 31 May 2007 (the date that the concession to the \"Friends\" ran out) to join the mothball fleet in Landevennec. Due to major technological similarities, the Navy cannibalized parts from her from time to time (mainly from the boilers and turbines) to maintain the helicopter-carrier ; with the decommissioning of \"Jeanne d'Arc\" in September 2010 \"Colbert\" was free to be dismantled. On 5 June 2016 \"Colbert\" arrived under tow at Bassens, River Gironde for decontamination and demolition.\n\n"}

It lies south of the Colombo Municipal Council area and separated from it by the Dehiwala canal which forms the northern boundary of DMMC. Its southern limits lie in Borupana Road and the eastern boundary is Weras Ganga with its canal system and including some areas to its east (Pepiliyana, Gangodawila and Kohuwala). This town has extensive population and rapid industrialization and urbanization in recent years. It is home to Sri Lanka's National Zoological Gardens, which remains one of Asia's largest. Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila and Colombo Airport, Ratmalana are some important landmark in this area. Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia and Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte being two large suburban centers of the city of Colombo function together as one large urban agglomeration in the Region (Western Province). The overspill from the City in residential and commercial uses of land have rapidly urbanised these suburban centers. Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia and Sri Jayawardenpaura along with Colombo Municipal Council form the most urbanized part of the core area of the Colombo Metropolitan Region. Dehiwala and Mount Lavinia lie along the Galle Road artery, which runs along the coast to the south of the country.\n\nThere are many stories about the history of this area. One of those is Diya Wala which means a dip or hole filled with water. In past this area consists full of ponds, lakes thus it became known as Diyawala (an area filled with water) and later on it became Dehiwala. Another story in this name regard is that this area has many trees of lime or a forest of lime trees and people call it Dehiwala. It is told that king of Kotte filled all his lime requirements from this area.\n\nBefore colonisation of the maritime region by the Portuguese, the area covered by the present DMMC was part of the Kingdom of Kotte. It comprised a number of villages such as Pepiliyana Nedimala, Attidiya and Kalubowila, while Ratmalana and areas south of Dehiwala were together one large expanse of marshland, and scarcely populated.\n\nDuring the Portuguese occupation, the Kingdom of Kotte was ruled by king Don Juan Dharmapala, and it encompassed the above-mentioned villages. Early records also indicate that in the year 1510 AD the village of “Galkissa” is mentioned and named after the rocky mound (Lihiniyagala) protruding into the Bay. Fascinating tales are woven round this rock and the village “Galkissa”. The Dutch invaders called the mound “the pregnant wench”.\n\nWith the arrival of the Dutch in the early seventeenth century, a more organised administrative structure was in place, whereby a broad based taxation and legal system evolved.\n\nHowever, it was only during British occupation (19th Century) that a Provincial administrative (Kachcheri) system and a form of Local Government developed. When the second Governor of Ceylon, Sir Thomas Maitland, acquired land at \"Galkissa\" (Mount Lavinia) and decided in 1806 to construct a personal residence there. Maitland fell in love with Lovina Aponsuwa, a local mestiço dancer, and continued a romantic affair with her until he was recalled to England in 1811. The Governor's mansion, which he named \"Mount Lavinia House\" is now the Mount Lavinia Hotel and the village that surrounded the building has subsequently developed into a bustling area, taking its name from the Governor's mistress, Lovina. Later, the area assumed the name of Mount Lavinia alluding to the factual story of a romance between the then British Governor Thomas Maitland (1805-1812) and a dancing girl called Lovina of the area.\n\nDehiwela, Mount Lavinia attained Municipal status in December 1959. Dehiwela Mount Lavinia as a Local body of 6 wards extending over a land extent of only 16.3 km (). Due to rapid urban growth and for administrative reasons this area was extended and divided into 19 wards in 1959 and given Municipal status. Later in 1967 the municipality was increased to an area of approximately was apportioned into 29 wards, as it exists today.\n\nAs the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia area lies on the coastal plain the land is mostly flat and undulating towards the inland areas. A significant feature is the large extent of wetlands around the Weras Ganga (river) and Bolgoda Lake the two major water bodies. The Bellanwila and Attidiya marshes are noteworthy for their bio-diversity and as such are considered as an ecological protected zone. Lying in the wet zone, the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia area receives an average annual rainfall between 2000 and 3000 mm mainly during the south west monsoon and the intermonsoon periods. Mean average day temperature is around 28 °C and average maximum between 30.5 and 31 °C Minimum night temperature varies from 26 °C to 27 °C.\n\nDehiwala-Mount Lavinia is a suburb of Colombo Metropolitan Region. Its Municipality comprises the following areas.\n\nDehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipality area is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural city.\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka (also called Colombo Zoo or Dehiwala Zoo) is a zoological garden in Dehiwala, Sri Lanka, founded in 1936. Its sprawling areas are host to a variety of animals and birds. The zoo exhibits animals but also places an emphasis on animal conservation and welfare, and education.\n\nMount Lavinia Beach is Sri Lanka's main sea-bathing spot. Here, depending on season, the waves can be swimmable and it's host to some amazing sunsets. The waters are swimmable only at certain times of the year and can be very rough, with undertow. From there you can cross the rail-tracks, past the three legged dog and Golden Mile restaurant, and you're on the beach. Among the things that are sold there are swimsuits, inflatable balls, sour mango, and manioca chips. The strip also boasts of high end restaurants like Lavinia Breeze, Long Feng, Steamboat, Belize, etc.\n\nThe Sri Lanka Air Force Museum (SLAF Museum) is the museum of the Sri Lanka Air Force, and its predecessor, the Royal Ceylon Air Force. Open to the public, the museum is at the SLAF Ratmalana and is maintained by the Sri Lanka Air Force. Notable items include the medals and sword of Air Vice Marshal E. R. Amarasekara, the first Ceylonese Commander of the Air Force. The museum also has remnants of Japanese aircraft shot down over Ceylon during World War 2 and artifacts from the LTTE aircraft shot down during the Suicide Air Raid on Colombo. An Austin Fire Fighting Vehicle and a Shorland armoured car used by the Sri Lanka Air Force is exhibited as well.\n\nDehiwala-Mount Lavinia is a suburb of Colombo Metropolitan Area, with a Municipal Council form of government. Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia's mayor and the council members are elected through local government elections held once in five years. The city government provides sewer, road management and waste management services, water, electricity and telephone utility services the council liaises with the road development authority, water supply and drainage board, the Ceylon electricity board and telephone service providers.\n\n\"There are 2 Divisional Secretary in the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia area\"\nThe Sri Lanka Police the main law enforcement agency of the island liaise with the municipal council, but is under the control of the Ministry of Defence of the central government. As with most Sri Lankan cities, the magistrate court handles felony crimes, the district court handles civil cases. There are 3 police stations within the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia area\n\nColombo has an extensive public transport system based on buses operated both by private operators and the government owned Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB). The primary bus terminals within the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia — Dehiwala Bus Terminal, Mount Lavinia Bus Terminal and Ratmalana Bus Terminal handle local services.\n\nTrain transport in the city is limited since most trains are meant for transport to and from the city rather than within it and are often overcrowded. Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia situated in the Coastal Line of Sri Lanka Railway which runs from Colombo towards Matara.\n\nThe road network in Dehiwala and Mount Lavinia consist of three classes of roads. Dehiwala and Mount Lavinia lie along the Galle Road artery in the West of the city, which runs along the coast to the south of the country. It is the gateway to the Colombo Metro City from the Southern part of Sri Lanka.\n\nRatmalana Airport is the city's airport, located 15 km (9.3 mi) south of the Colombo city centre and 2 km from Dehiwala junction. It commenced operating in 1935 and was the country's first international airport until it was replaced by Bandaranaike Airport in 1967. Ratmalana Airport now primarily services domestic flights, aviation training and international corporate flights.\n\nOther means of transport includes auto rickshaws (commonly called \"three wheelers\") and taxicabs. Three wheelers are entirely operated by individuals and hardly regulated whilst cab services are run by private companies and are metered.\n\nEducation institutions in Colombo have a long history. Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia has many of the prominent public schools in the country, some of them government-owned and others private. Certain urban schools of Sri Lanka have some religious alignment; this is partly due to the influence of British who established Christian missionary schools. Colombo has many International Schools that have come up in the recent years.\n\n\n"}

The negotiations began on 30 April after the failure of the Polish-Lithuanian siege of Belaya. Overall, the agreement confirmed the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold) for Władysław IV agreeing to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Russia. Władysław, despite holding an upper hand, was trying to bring Russia into an anti-Sweden alliance; hence in a gesture of goodwill he agreed to give the Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories. However, the alliance never came through, as the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś, subsequently objected, and Russians saw no benefit in such an alliance. The sides also reached an agreement on prisoner exchange and a trade treaty.\n\nThe treaty ended the almost unbroken series of wars between the Commonwealth and its neighbours that had been waged since the beginning of the 17th century.

Aside from songs that appeared on \"Vertical Man\", much of the set is devoted to Starr's Beatles and early solo successes with Starr relating their stories in a relaxed, and sometimes humorous, fashion.\n\nThis marked the last time a Ringo Starr album was released on a pre-recorded cassette in the United States, according to journalist Peter Palmiere. However, some countries in the Far East still issue cassettes of recent Ringo Starr material including \"Ringo Rama\", \"Choose Love\" and \"\".\n\nReleased by Mercury in the US on 20 October 1998, \"VH1 Storytellers\" stands as a unique release in Starr's recorded catalogue.

Rudbeckia flowers feature a prominent, raised central disc in black, brown shades of green, and in-between tones, giving rise to their familiar common names of coneflowers and black-eyed-susans. All are native to North America, and many species are cultivated in gardens for their showy yellow or gold flower heads that bloom in mid to late summer.\n\nThe species are herbaceous, mostly perennial plants (some annual or biennial) growing to 0.5–3.0 m tall, with simple or branched stems. The leaves are spirally arranged, entire to deeply lobed, and 5–25 cm long. The flowers are produced in daisy-like inflorescences, with yellow or orange florets arranged in a prominent, cone-shaped head; \"cone-shaped\" because the ray florets tend to point out and down (are decumbent) as the flower head opens.\n\nA large number of species have been proposed within \"Rudbeckia\", but most are now regarded as synonyms of the limited list given below.\n\nSeveral currently accepted species have several accepted varieties. Some of them (for example the black-eyed susan, \"R. hirta\"), are popular garden flowers distinguished for their long flowering times. Many cultivars of these species are known.\n\n\"Rudbeckia\" is one of at least four genera within the flowering plant family Asteraceae whose members are commonly known as coneflowers; the others are \"Echinacea\", \n\"Dracopis\", and \"Ratibida\".\n\n\"Rudbeckia\" species are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species including cabbage moths and dot moths.\n\nThe name was given by Carolus Linnaeus to honor his patron and fellow botanist at Uppsala University, Olof Rudbeck the Younger (1660-1740), as well as Rudbeck's late father Olof Rudbeck the Elder (1630-1702), a distinguished Naturalist, Philologist, and Doctor of Medicine (he had discovered the lymphatic system), and founder of Sweden's first botanic garden, now the Linnaean Garden at Uppsala. In 1730 Linnaeus had been invited into the home of the younger Rudbeck (now almost 70) as tutor his youngest children. Rudbeck had then recommended Linnaeus to replace him as a lecturer at the university and as the botanical garden demonstrator, even though Linnaeus was only in his second year of studies. In his book \"The Compleat Naturalist: A Life of Linnaeus\", Wilfred Blunt quotes Linnaeus's dedication: \nSo long as the earth shall survive and as each spring shall see it covered with flowers, the Rudbeckia will preserve your glorious name. I have chosen a \"noble\" plant in order to recall your merits and the services you have rendered, a \"tall\" one to give an idea of your stature, and I wanted it to be one which branched and which flowered and fruited freely, to show that you cultivated not only the sciences but also the humanities. Its rayed flowers will bear witness that you shone among savants like the sun among the stars; its perennial roots will remind us that each year sees you live again through new works. Pride of our gardens, the Rudbeckia will be cultivated throughout Europe and in distant lands where your revered name must long have been known. Accept this plant, not for what it is but for what it will become when it bears your name.\n\n\n\nMany species are used in prairie restorations, for ornamental use, and by livestock for forage. An abundance of these plants on a rangeland indicates good health. They are deer and rabbit resistant.\n\n"}

Portrayed by Helen Worth, the character first appeared on-screen on 29 July 1974. As of 2019, Gail has been on the show for 45 years, which currently makes her the fourth longest-running character after Ken Barlow (William Roache), Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), and Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox). Worth took a break from the serial in 2019, Gail departed for a while on 8 July 2019 following being disowned and stressed by her family's latest dramas, leading her to book a one-way ticket on a flight to Thailand. Gail returned on 25 October 2019.\n\nGail is the daughter of Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and Ted Page (Michael Byrne) and is the mother of Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) and David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) and has featured in some of the most controversial and high-profile storylines in the soap involving her family and her number of relationships — jointly with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), she is the soap's most married character, having been married six times.\n\nGail's storylines include her marriage to Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten); her vicious feud with her mother-in-law Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie); her affair with Brian's cousin Ian Latimer; coping when Brian is killed in a knife attack; marrying the much younger Martin Platt (Sean Wilson); coping when her teenage daughter Sarah falls pregnant at the age of 13; divorcing Martin and marrying serial killer Richard Hillman (Brian Capron); being kidnapped with Sarah, David and her granddaughter Bethany Platt (Emily Walton/Lucy Fallon) by Richard and being driven into the canal by him; her feud with Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) after her son Todd (Bruno Langley) comes out as gay while dating Sarah; throwing David out after he hides drugs in Bethany's toys; being pushed down the stairs by David after he discovers that she took Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) to a private abortion clinic to terminate a pregnancy fathered by David; marrying Tina's father Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale); being imprisoned for Joe's murder when his plan to fake his own death goes wrong; a relationship with Audrey's ex-partner Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers) only for him to con her out of all her money; a feud with David's wife Kylie Turner (Paula Lane); coping with the secret that Kylie slept with Nick and that her unborn baby may not be David's; marrying the burglar who robbed her home, Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis); keeping the secret that Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) is not actually Michael's son but an impostor; trying to help David come to terms with Kylie's death; locking David in the cellar of the Bistro after discovering that he is going to kill Kylie's murderer; and shooting Lorraine Kelly with an arrow.\n\nGail Potter is a friend of Tricia Hopkins (Kathy Jones) and a boss. She is first seen as a teenager in July 1974 when she tells Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) that Tricia fancies him. In April 1975, Gail discovers that the man her mother was living with – Frank Peterson – isn't her father as she thought. Angry, Gail leaves home, moving into the shop flat with her co-worker/former schoolfriend, Tricia. Gail is plagued by nuisance telephone calls and when phone engineer, John Lane, turns up one evening to catch the culprit, Gail realises that it is him. Luckily, Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) sees him go in, her suspicions aroused, and the police are called.\n\nAfter the warehouse they work in burns down, Gail and Tricia work in the Corner Shop, but when Renee Bradshaw (Madge Hindle) buys the shop and flat in June 1976, the girls are evicted. Tricia leaves Weatherfield and Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) returns. Elsie ensures that Gail can stay in the flat. Elsie and Gail find work at \"Sylvia's Separates\" and move into No 11. She loses her virginity to Roy Thornley but discovers that he is married and Gail is cited in a messy divorce. In December 1976, \"Sylvia's Separates\" is taken over by Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) and renamed the Western Front. Elsie is moved from boutique manager to factory supervisor and Gail is promoted to manager with Suzie Birchall (Cheryl Murray), working for her. In early 1977, Suzie joins Elsie and Gail at No 11, and the three women become one of the programme's most popular groups.\n\nIn November 1978, Mike Baldwin closes down the Western Front, but things look up for Gail in December when Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten) gatecrashes a party at Elsie's and asks her out. In January 1979, Gail gets a job working with Emily Bishop in Dawson's Cafe. By April, Brian and Gail are engaged, beginning a long feud between Gail and Brian's mother, Ivy (Lynne Perrie), and saw the arrival of Gail's mother, Audrey Potter (Sue Nicholls). Brian and Gail are married that November and move in with Brian's parents at number five. Gail and Brian move to a one-bedroomed house at 5 Buxton Close in August 1980 and on New Year's Eve, their son, Nicky (Warren Jackson) is born. The Tilsleys' marriage never seems wholly secure, especially with narcissistic Brian being given free rein by his doting mother, and soon hits a rocky spot. Gail is propositioned by Brian's friend, Colin Jackson, and Brian is dazzled by customer Glenda Fox. In January 1982, Brian's boss, Ron Sykes, announces that he is selling the business and emigrating to the Persian Gulf. Faced with the choice of working away or redundancy, Brian goes to work in Qatar. Gail makes friends with neighbour, Jackie Moffatt, but bored at home on her own, asks Jackie to look after Nicky while she works part-time in Jim Sedgewick's café (she had briefly worked there when it first opened in 1980), now run by Jim's ex-wife, Alma Sedgewick, (Amanda Barrie).\n\nBrian announces that he is staying in the Gulf, extending his contract by two months. Lonely, Gail agrees to go for a drink with truck driver, Les Charlton, (Graham Fellows) but Nicky goes missing and is eventually found in the newly rebuilt number seven. A distressed Gail thinks about giving up her job and loses interest in Les. But Les's last visit coincides with Brian's return and he makes it very clear to Les that he is not welcome. Brian decides not to return to Qatar and admits having \"had a drink\" with a nurse and Gail realizes that his friendship with her was a lot closer than he is admitting. In August 1982, using the money he made in Qatar, Brian opens a garage in partnership with Ron Sykes and for a while, the Tilsleys are happy. In March 1983, things seem to be going so well that Brian takes out a bank loan and buys Ron Sykes's share of the garage. However, there is a change in fortunes – Brian's father, Bert (Peter Dudley), is seriously injured while overinflating a tyre at the garage and dies soon afterwards, and the business starts losing money – forcing Brian to put it up for sale. He is talked out of selling by Gail and Mike Baldwin, deciding to sell the house in Buxton Close instead, and move back in with Ivy. The Tilsleys' marriage now begins to crumble as living under the same roof irritates Ivy and Gail and when in August 1984, Gail is offered the job of manager at Jim's Cafe, she takes it – annoying Brian and Ivy. A couple of months later, there is more friction when Brian finds that Audrey's latest boyfriend, George Hepworth (Richard Moore), made a pass at Gail. By April 1985, Gail has had enough and leaves Brian, moving her and Nicky into a bedsit. This finally makes Brian get a council house so Gail and Nicky move in there with him.\n\nEarly in 1986, Brian's Australian cousin, Ian Latimer (Michael Loney) visits and stays with Ivy. Soon he and Gail are having an affair. Gail admits this to Brian on learning that she is pregnant and doesn't know who is the father. Blood tests show that Sarah-Louise (Lynsay & Leah King), who is born in January 1987, cannot be Ian's but Brian never really bonds with Sarah-Louise, and moves in with his new girlfriend, Liz Turnbull (Catriona A Elliott). Soon after, Brian divorces Gail. Gail starts dating Jeff Singleton (Jonathan Barlow), and Brian doesn't like the idea of him being a stand-in father. After Brian's abortive attempt to kidnap Nicky, Brian and Gail reconcile and he moves back into Hammond Road, and they remarry in February 1988. However, Gail realises that she married too young and Brian's old-fashioned attitudes about wives mean that the marriage will never work so they separate again but continue living under the same roof. Eventually, Gail asks for another divorce after a massive row one evening in February 1989. Brian's attempt to find other female company that same evening results in him stabbed to death outside a nightclub.\n\nAlma returns to Weatherfield from Spain late in 1988, and in June 1989, offers Gail a 40% partnership in Jim's Café, which she accepts. Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) has been working at the café since 1985. To Gail's surprise, she finds herself attracted to Martin, who is 10 years younger than her. Martin comforts Gail when she is upset about recent events and a few kisses leads to them ending up in bed together.\n\nMuch against Ivy and Audrey's wishes, Martin moves in with Gail and the children, and by the spring of 1990, she is pregnant. Feeling that she can't cope with three children and doesn't want Martin to be tied down too young, she decides to have an abortion. Martin catches her just as her train pulls out of the station and persuades her not to go ahead so David (Thomas Ormson) is born on Christmas Day 1990. Gail and Martin marry in September 1991 and in December, Martin buys number eight and the Platt family move in. Gail's emotional trials are far from over. When Martin studies to become a nurse, Carmel Finnan (Catherine Cusack), a fellow student, stays with them in late 1992 and becomes besotted with Martin. Gail angrily throws her out after Carmel tells Gail that she is too old for Martin but she returns a few weeks later, claiming she's expecting Martin's baby and tries to kidnap David. This causes a fight between her and Gail and Carmel falls down the stairs. At the hospital, it is found that she isn't pregnant and her grandfather arrives, explaining her mental history.\n\nDuring 1994, tensions build as a now teenaged Nicky refuses to acknowledge Martin as a \"father\" (particularly when he disciplines him for smoking), causing problems for Martin and Gail. Depressed after Christmas celebrations at work, Martin sleeps with Cathy Power, (Theresa Brindley) and is caught kissing her Audrey's husband, Alf Roberts, (Bryan Mosley). Alf and Martin agree to keep it between them but when Audrey finds out, Martin confesses everything to Gail. Gail takes the betrayal very badly, and although they continue to live together, she and Martin barely speak but reconcile after a family holiday in North Wales. However, tensions with Nick (as he now wants to be called) grow and are aggravated by Ivy's death in August 1995, more than a year after she had left Coronation Street. She leaves most of her estate to Nick – providing he changes his name back to Tilsley. Months of wrangling and bad feeling ensue, with Gail, Martin, Nick and Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff), Ivy's second husband, constantly arguing. Martin, however, disagrees since he is his adoptive father, but Gail knew that Ivy wanted Nicky to have Brian's surname. To end her feud with Ivy despite her death, they agreed to change his surname back to Tilsley. In January 1996, Gail settles the row by getting Don to pay Nick £12,000 for the house. Soon after, Gail meets her half-brother, Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce) when he visits Weatherfield. Later in 1996, Martin and Gail's marriage is strained, due to conflict between Nick and Martin so Stephen invites them to Canada for a holiday and Nick decides to go to school there, using the money Don paid him for Ivy's house.\n\nRoy Cropper (David Neilson) begins working in the café with Gail when Alma wants to spend less time there and eventually, Alma sells her share in the café to Roy after she and Gail fall out over Stephen's decision to cancel his contract with Mike. Gail and Roy get on very well and things tick over as usual. Roy even gives Gail and Martin a weekend trip to Paris from the vouchers he has saved. In 1997, Don is in prison after attacking Mike and Alma but is diagnosed with terminal cancer and asks to see Gail to make amends for the trouble he caused since Ivy's death. Don leaves hospital, attacks Mike and crashes Alma's car into the viaduct, killing himself. Nick (now played by Adam Rickett) returns for the funeral and starts dating Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), part of a loud, obnoxious family now living in number five. Gail is furious when Nick and Leanne elope to Scotland in January 1998.\n\nBrian's murderer, Darren Whately, is released from prison on parole in 1998 and Nick persuades Leanne to write to him so he starts stalking her. Gail urges Nick to report him to the police when things get out of control and Darren is returned to prison. Leanne and Nick are shocked to learn that Leanne is pregnant, something Gail disapproves of, and their marriage ends after Nick pressures her to have an abortion and tell people that she miscarried. Nick returns to Canada, much to Gail's delight that he is no longer with Leanne, behaviour very similar to her former mother-in-law, Ivy.\n\nGail tires of her responsibility of the café and sells her share to Roy and his new girlfriend Hayley Patterson (Julie Hesmondhalgh), but continues to work there. The café relocates in 1999 to a new development on Victoria Street and is renamed Roy's Rolls. 1999 also sees Gail and Martin's marriage get into serious trouble after Gail demands Martin have a vasectomy after she has a pregnancy scare and doesn't want any more children. Martin refuses and Gail's unreasonable behaviour and anger pushes Martin to become good friends with another nurse, Rebecca Hopkins (Jill Halfpenny). They initially bond over troublesome spouses but soon begin an affair that lasts into 2000. Martin plans on leaving Gail for Rebecca, but this is put on hold when they discover that Sarah (now played by Tina O'Brien), now 13, is refusing to eat and being sick. Fearing that she is developing an eating disorder, Gail takes her to the doctors and learns that Sarah is five months pregnant and gives birth to Bethany (Emily & Amy Walton) in June 2000. Sarah struggles with motherhood and Gail quits her job so she can look after Bethany while Sarah is at school and enjoy being a teenager occasionally. The truth about Martin's affair comes out soon after the baby's birth and Gail is devastated. She tries to keep the family together but it doesn't work as Gail kept on taking her frustration out on Sarah, accusing her of being a bad mother which caused her to run away and to move into the Croppers' flat. Gail felt very guilty after Sarah returned home. She breaks down and tells Martin she wants a divorce. Martin moves out in October 2000, and he and Gail divorce the following year. Soon after Martin leaves, Gail gets a job as a receptionist in the newly built medical centre.\n\nThe character of Gail then becomes central to one of the soap's most high-profile plot lines in which episodes would go on to get viewing figures more than 17 million. Following Alma's death in June 2001, Gail became friends with her cousin: Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), a financial advisor. They gradually formed a relationship for the rest of the year and were eventually married in July 2002. However, while their marriage appeared to be thoroughly perfect as Gail had hoped, she was totally unaware that Richard had financial difficulties after proposals for a bail hostel to be built near apartments he had developed causes them not to sell; because of this, Richard ended up murdering two people and even tried to kill Gail's mother Audrey along with her friend Emily Bishop. When Audrey begins to suspect Richard, she tries to warn Gail but Gail believes Audrey is suffering from dementia as Richard made everyone, including Audrey at first believe through the use of secret mind games. This leads to a row and Gail cuts off contact with Audrey when she continues to call Richard a murderer, much to Audrey's heartache. Also, while Gail was still oblivious to Richard's actions, Sarah was seriously injured in a car crash caused by her boyfriend: Aidan Critchley (Dean Ashton), after he stole Ken Barlow's (William Roache) car. Aidan escapes from the wreckage, leaving Sarah for dead. She makes a full recovery but never forgives Aiden for what he did. When Gail begins to suspect that her husband is more than he seems, she confronts him with her suspicions and the worst is confirmed when Richard admits everything to her in a special two-hander episode broadcast on 24 February 2003; emulating that he murdered both Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw) and his ex-wife Patricia (Annabelle Apsion), left his business partner and the Rovers' landlord Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) to die following a collapse, and tried to kill both Audrey and Emily – the latter which led to Maxine's murder and Richard subsequently framing Aidan for the crimes as revenge for Sarah's accident. Richard, after confessing that his crimes were all part of his financial benefit, tries to justify his actions whilst asserting his love for both Gail and her children.\n\nGail, however, is absolutely horrified with the truth of her husband and calls Richard \"Norman Bates With A Briefcase\" before throwing him out. She later reconciles with Audrey and together the pair give a statement to the police about Richard's confession, thus exposing his crimes and making him the most wanted fugitive in the UK. Gail subsequently attempts to rebuild her life back on track, but Richard secretly returns three weeks after fleeing Coronation Street. He takes Gail, Sarah, David (now played by Jack P. Shepherd) and Bethany hostage and attempts to gas them in the garage but their neighbours hear the sound of Richard's car in the garage, so he speeds off and drives them all into the canal. Gail, Sarah, David, and Bethany survive but Richard drowns. Gail later finds out that she faces financial ruin, due to Richard's actions and could lose her house. Her neighbour Vera Duckworth (Elizabeth Dawn) accuses her of being in league with Richard, as she and her husband Jack (Bill Tarmey) also face financial instability as Richard was their financial advisor. However, Audrey saves the day by using her life savings to buy the house for Gail and her family.\n\nAfter managing to overcome her trauma with Richard for the rest of 2003, Gail manages to rebuild her life until she and Sarah end up having another problem together. This begins with Sarah and Bethany moving out of the house and into a flat with Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), her closest friend. This prompts Gail to call Social Services, hoping to get Bethany returned to her so Sarah will have to return too. When this doesn't work, Gail and Sarah have no contact for several months. Sarah becomes pregnant again and she and Todd get engaged, further angering Gail, just like her relationship with her former mother-in-law Ivy. However, Todd admits to Sarah that he is gay so they break up and Sarah and Bethany move out, returning to live with Gail. When Sarah tells Gail what has happened, the fight between Gail and Eileen (Sue Cleaver), Todd's mother, turns physical as Gail is furious at the position Todd has left Sarah in, 16 years old and 7 months pregnant with her 2nd child. Sarah is rushed to hospital with a placental abruption and needs an emergency Caesarean. She survives but baby Billy is very ill and dies the day after he is born.\n\nGail also does her best to come between Nick and his new girlfriend, Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie), believing that Maria will break Nick's heart again as she emigrated with him to Canada briefly once before but returned alone, as she wasn't happy there. They eventually do break up, and despite being very cold with each other for several months, Gail comforts Maria when she is devastated that Nick leaves to start a new job in Nottingham.\n\nIn 2005, Gail begins a relationship with chiropodist Phil Nail (Clive Russell), much to David's annoyance and he constantly tries to come between them.\n\nFrom early 2006, Gail receives cards from her late husband Richard, unnerving her so much that she becomes reliant on sleeping pills and drink. She contacts the police and thinks that the new boyfriend, Phil, is responsible and this causes Phil and David to argue, resulting in him and Gail breaking up and Phil leaving. Her relationship with David is strained to the point of breakdown when she realizes that he is sending the cards. She takes him to the police to close the case but doesn't press charges. Gail forgives David and believes that she can keep him in line, only to find that he is not going to school. On Christmas Day 2006, David unveils Ivy Brennan's diary, revealing Gail's planned abortion and he also exposes Audrey's affair with Bill Webster (Peter Armitage). David runs away from home when Gail tells him she wants him to start paying rent but returns with the police after claiming that Gail is abusing him. The final straw is when Bethany swallows an ecstasy tablet that was hidden in her doll's head by David in September 2007. Bethany is rushed to intensive care, and following an ultimatum from Sarah, Gail makes David move out and orders him not to attend Sarah's wedding to his enemy Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). As revenge, David writes a suicide note and leaves it on the kitchen table for Gail to find the day before the wedding. However, Sarah finds it first and believing it to be another attention-seeking stunt, she puts it in the bin. The next day, David sees his family celebrating the wedding, despite the suicide note. To prove his point, he drives his car into the same part of the canal that Richard had driven them all into four years earlier. A distraught Gail waits for hours for news on whether he is alive or dead, and when he eventually turns up at the house, Gail swears to him that she will never let the situation get so out of hand again. Her relationship with Sarah becomes strained when it is revealed that Sarah was aware of the suicide note when in fact he hadn't intended on killing himself at all, just ruin Sarah's wedding. She began to blame herself, how her son David becomes evil since his father Martin left the town, and wish that she and Martin never divorced.\n\nGail's half brother Stephen comes to stay for Christmas and offers David a job in Milan which he accepts. However, as revenge for spoiling her wedding day, Sarah plants ecstasy tablets in his drawer at Audrey's salon and when Audrey finds them, Gail insists that David is not to go to Milan. Sarah is offered the job instead and plans on leaving with Jason and Bethany. However, she joyfully tells Jason what she did at the airport and disgusted with her, Jason returns to Weatherfield alone and tells Gail what really happened.\n\nIn March 2008, David's new girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) tells Gail that she is pregnant with David's baby. Believing that neither of them are ready for parenthood, Gail offers to pay for Tina to have an abortion and to keep it from David, which Tina accepts. However, David soon finds out and is angry with Gail. He goes to pack his bags and Gail begs him not to go and tries to explain her reasons, but David doesn't want to know and pushes her away from him. She is at the top of the stairs and has a terrible fall resulting in her being hospitalised and suffering from short-term amnesia. Gail eventually remembers who pushed her but forgives David believing she pushed him to it. However, believing that he should be punished for nearly killing his mother, he begins smashing up windows in the street resulting in him spending several weeks in prison. Ted Page (Michael Byrne), Gail's long lost father, gets in touch with Audrey. Gail finds out and is angry that she was not told. However, she arranges to meet Ted after he discovers he has a daughter, 3 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild.\n\nGail takes a shine to Tina's father, Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale), and they start dating. Joe later proposes to Gail on a boat he renovated. However, Gail is unaware that Joe is deeply in debt, as his business has collapsed and is frequently visited by a debt collector. Gail marries Joe in January 2010 despite his debt. While Gail and Joe are on holiday the next month, Joe tries to fake his own death for the life insurance money. He tells Gail, who is horrified, and asks him to go to the police but they argue on the boat and Joe falls, spraining his wrist. The fight is witnessed by another couple. Joe eventually manages to push Gail back on to the dock and he sets sail. Shortly afterwards, Joe is knocked from the boat and drowns but Gail thinks he has gone ahead with his plan so she calls David and tells him about Joe's plan and they agree to tell people that Joe has got a job in the Lake District, thinking he will return. They take Joe's boat in from the lake and go home. Gail is devastated when Joe's body is found. However, the police find many inconsistencies in her story, especially when the couple from the lakes come forward as witnesses. She is arrested during Joe's wake for his murder and later charged after an indignant Tina tells the police that Gail intends to visit her daughter in Milan and that she asked Tina to lie to them. Consequently, Gail is denied bail and her trial is scheduled for three months later. Gail fears the worst, especially when former neighbour Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) makes a false testimony against her claiming that Gail admitted in their prison cell to killing Joe with a rolling pin, but is relieved when she is found not guilty.\n\nGail learns that David is engaged to Kylie Turner (Paula Lane) and is against the marriage. Once David and Kylie are married Gail later warms to the marriage and allows them both to continue living with her. Gail and Audrey bump into Audrey's ex-boyfriend, professional con artist, Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers). They report him to the police but he is not charged and returns to Weatherfield, much to Audrey's horror. They reconcile, much to Gail's disgust, and live happily together. Lewis also gets a job at Nick's Bistro. However, Gail is sure that sooner or later Lewis will hurt Audrey so she plots with Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) to get proof that Lewis is really in love with Audrey. Audrey, however, finds out about this and doesn't stop them so when Lewis realizes that she knew, he leaves her. Wanting revenge, he later fools Gail into falling in love with him and they plan to remortgage her house and buy a hotel business in Italy. After telling her family this, and with Audrey and David disgusted, Lewis (by text) instructs Gail to turn on the DVD of 'Italian for Lovers' which David does. To the family's horror, Lewis has hacked her bank account, taken the money and left the country.\n\nGail meets a man named Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis), who turns up at her house pretending to be a gas man, who has come to the house to look at the \"gas leak\". He is revealed as a burglar and pushes Gail, causing her to fall over, and Kylie chases him out of the street, but he gets into his van and drives off. Gail starts to become anxious when she is home alone due to the burglary and is helped by her son David, Kylie and Audrey. However, Gail and Michael gradually grow close as Gail helps him to rebuild his life and she begins to stick up for him in front of David and Kylie. Eventually, Michael moves in with her.\n\nIn January 2015, Michael proposes to Gail, however, she is taken aback by the proposal and Michael is scared that he had rushed into things and that she would leave him. However that evening at the bistro, Gail turns the tables and proposes to Michael. The celebrations are cut short when Michael collapses and is rushed to Weatherfield General. He later discovers he will require open heart surgery. When Sarah returns to Weatherfield in March 2015, she meets Michael but rudely refers to him as the 'burglar' before shaking hands. Gail and Michael are eventually married in April 2015.\n\nHowever, in June 2015 after Michael receives a photo album from his former wife Susan detailing the life of their son Gavin, it is revealed to Michael that Andy Carver has been posing as his son and the real Gavin is dead. Michael is horrified to learn that Gail (as well as David and Andy's girlfriend Steph) knew about the fake identity and aided Andy in keeping the lie secret. Michael walks out on Gail. Unable to forgive her, Michael later demands a divorce and moves in with his new friend Eileen Grimshaw. Later Michael tells Gail that he and Eileen shared a kiss and Gail and Eileen end up fighting in the street. In July, Gail is upset when Michael and Eileen begin a relationship.\n\nGail stands by David and Kylie when Max's biological father, Callum Logan (Sean Ward), begins terrorising the family, as he wants custody of Max. Gail tries to co-operate with Callum's own mother, Marion, but the mediation sessions between him and David end in failure, worsening the situation as time goes on. After Max says he saw Callum and some other gangsters beating up Jason, Gail forces him out of the house when he stops by for one of his impromptu visits, only for Max to tell Callum he \"wishes he was dead\", leading to Callum chasing Max into the road. Max is then hit by Nick in a van. Thankfully, he recovers. Gail's hatred for Callum reaches new heights when he has thugs raid Audrey's salon. Following this, Callum suddenly disappears, and Gail assumes he has decided to leave the family alone from now on.\n\nIn September 2015, as uncertainty grows about the future living situation at No.8, Gail and David agree to convert the garage into a \"granny annexe\" for Gail to live in. After it is finished, Gail discovers there is damp underneath the floor. This eventually dissipates, but Gail begins to notice David, Kylie, and Sarah acting out of the ordinary. She passes it off and officially moves into the annexe. However, in January 2016, Gail tells David and Kylie she wants underfloor heating for her annexe. She gets Jason to take a look at it, but David, frustrated, stops him from doing so, raising Gail's evermore suspicions about her son's temperament.\n\nIn 2016, it was revealed that there was a decomposed body in the manhole underneath Gail's annexe after a car crash involving Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) and Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine). The body was later revealed as Callum, who was missing for a couple of months. Gail considered her family responsible for the murder but looked passed it after it was later said that Jason's father, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard) was \"guilty\" of murdering him.\n\nGail's daughter Sarah began experiencing mental issues after believing that Callum wasn't dead and was still on the run and coming to kill her. Billy Mayhew's (Daniel Brocklebank) brother Lee ended up kidnapping Sarah before she went into hospital, telling her that Callum is indeed \"alive\". Sarah angers him by pushing him into a table, injuring him. Lee pushes her, looking like he is going to rape her and then Gail's son David kicks open the door and saves her from him. Sarah then goes into hospital leaving her newborn baby Harry with Gail's daughter-in-law, Kylie. Michael also later reconciles with Gail after splitting with Eileen, and moves back into No 8.\n\nIn July 2016, Gail's son David and his wife Kylie agreed to leave Weatherfield and move to Barbados with Kylie's half-sister Becky McDonald. This was cancelled because of the sudden death of Kylie after she was stabbed by Clayton Hibbs after protecting Gemma Winter (Dolly Rose-Campbelle). Gail and her family grieved following this especially David, Max, and Lily. These memories bring Gail back from her first husband Brian when he was stabbed thirty years ago.\n\nIn October 2016, Gail was horrified by David as he tried to kill Clayton and himself by crashing into his police van with his car full of petrol and by lighting a flame. Gail later found a suicide video, by David, stating that he didn't want to upset the kids but was doing this for Kylie. Gail's method for preventing David from suicide was by trapping him in the Bistro's wine cellar during the trial.\n\nDavid later escaped the cellar and ended up crashing into Gary Windass (Mikey North) and his own daughter, Lily. They both survived but soon after the explosion, Gary's mother Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) got caught up in flames after she fell into a petrol puddle and ended up receiving serious burns to the legs. Gail understood to not ask further questions to David as he felt terrible about it all.\n\nIn November 2016, Michael is found dead after Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre) allowed him to die of a heart attack. Gail is devastated, and she and Eileen put aside their differences for Michael's funeral. Michael is cremated off-screen, and Gail scatters his ashes into a pond near to where they were planning to renew their vows.\n\nIn January 2017, Gail's granddaughter Bethany, begins dating an older man called Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) who ended up only being with her to exploit her and groom her. At the same time, David becomes involved with new girl, Shona Ramsey (Julia Goulding), who was also involved with Nathan.\n\nIn May 2017, Gail begins pairing up David and fellow hairdresser Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) after believing that they had feelings for each other and were the \"perfect match\". David and Maria find out about Gail's plans and agree to mess with her. They pretend to be engaged and in love and later take it to the next level and pretend that Maria is pregnant with David's baby. Audrey discovers that they are lying to them and tells Gail. Gail pretends to organise the wedding plans and David tells her that it was all a joke.\n\nIn June 2017, Gail discovers that Bethany has been involved in a sex ring and is horrified. After believing that Nathan doesn't really love her, Bethany leaves him and gets him arrested. Gail's precious son Nick decides to leave Weatherfield for good because he has nothing left in Weatherfield. They have a touching moment together.\n\nGail's son David and Shona get closer and share a kiss in hospital together. This annoys Gail because she knows that Shona is the mother of Kylie's killer Clayton. She warns Shona to stay away and even offers her £600 to make her move away. Shona ends up telling David the truth and she leaves Weatherfield after being upset by David. David finds out that Gail knew about everything and kicks her out of his house, but eventually lets her back in.\n\nIn 2018, Gail finds out Pat Phelan watched Michael die.\n\nActress Helen Worth was cast as Gail Potter in 1974. The role of Gail was initially intended to be very minor, a friend of the more established character Tricia Hopkins (Kathy Jones), who was introduced as part of a new family. The Hopkins family made little impact on the show, and, after they were written out, Gail went on to become one of the most popular and high-profile characters in the history of the series. Although Worth was 23 at the time of her casting, the character of Gail was supposed to be 16 when she first appeared.\n\nThe character of Gail was first portrayed as a teenager who liked to have fun with her best friends, first Tricia, then later Suzie Birchall (Cheryl Murray). However, following her first marriage to mechanic Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten) her storylines have seen her constantly suffer many blows and misery. She has had five husbands, three children, and four grandchildren, although her grandson died in infancy. Her storylines have seen her feuding with a domineering mother-in-law, deal with affairs, three divorces, being widowed three times, deal with traumas from each of her children, marry a serial killer who in turn tried to kill her and her family, and even been imprisoned to await a murder trial after being falsely accused of murdering her fourth husband. Throughout each of these ordeals, her personality altered from laid back to a bitter, miserable, whiny and bossy woman, a clone of her former mother-in-law Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie). She has been known to interfere in her children's lives as family is important to her and she didn't come from a stable family background. Her mother gave birth to her at 18 because she thought it would help her get the baby back that she had been forced to give up for adoption two years previously. Gail's father was never told about her and as a result, she was mostly brought up by her grandmother or to fend for herself while her mother went out with a string of men. This caused Gail to become a headstrong, independent young woman. However, she always swore that her own children would have a proper family life, living with both their parents. However this hasn't worked out and she has been left with repeated failed marriages and being a single mother to her children. In early storylines, Gail appeared to know both her parents and it was suggested they were married. At the time of her affair with Roy Thornley in the episode broadcast on August 30, 1976, she was particularly anxious about what her father would think, stating that he always read the newspaper out loud to her mother over breakfast. However, as the character of Gail became more established and prominent in the series, her background was 'retconned' to introduce her single mother Audrey and to provide a more consistent back story. She interferes in her children's lives, thinking she is helping and knows what's best, causing many arguments in the process and feuding with whoever gets involved with her children, just like her own relationship with Ivy. Particularly after marrying a serial killer and putting her children's lives in danger, Gail's interfering has increased immensely. Actress Helen Worth has stated that she loves Gail's storylines as the many traumas give her great opportunities as an actress.\n\nThe character's feud with neighbour Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) arose when Eileen's son, Todd (Bruno Langley) gave up his university course to remain with Gail's daughter Sarah-Louise (Tina O'Brien); Sarah later married Eileen's older son, Jason, but the marriage soon broke up. Various things, including the 2010 tram crash, have caused them to put aside their differences.\n\nCleaver has commented, \"Eileen's relationship with Gail is horrendous [...] I love all the scraps in the street with Gail. Helen Worth (Gail) and I love doing all that – we have such a laugh with the abusive comments we make for each other. The constant battle is fun. It's a love-hate relationship.\" Worth has suggested that Gail probably thinks she is \"a little better than Eileen\". Jenny Platt, who played Violet Wilson, has noted that \"Gail's found her nemesis in Eileen, but it's so stupid because actually they are so similar. They are both single mums looking out for their kids.\" In June 2015, they fought in the street after Gail discovered Eileen had kissed her estranged husband Michael.\n\nIn 2008, Gail began a relationship with Joe McIntyre portrayed by Reece Dinsdale. The relationship was rocky just like most of other Gail's relationships but the two characters later went on to marry. Conclusion to the storyline and ending of the relationship resulting in Joe's death. In November 2009, \"The Sun\" reported Joe would decide to disappear on a boating holiday in the Lake District after experiencing a debt crisis which begins to spiral out of control, in a surprise twist, Joe ends up losing his life for real when a sail pole knocks him unconscious and into freezing cold water before he can carry out his plan in full. The plot mirrored real-life case of fraudster John Darwin, who faked his own death while out canoeing before turning up alive five years later in December 2007. A source said: \"It's a copycat storyline of Darwin's insurance scam. Corrie bosses have decided that Joe will meet a watery end. He decides to fake his own death to avoid his crippling debt problems and leave wife Gail with the proceeds from his life insurance.\"\n\nSpeaking of how Joe compared to Gail's other husband, Helen Worth said; \"On paper, Joe looks quite normal! He's like any other normal man with problems and they're getting on top of him. Gail will share those problems. Like she says, when Gail marries him, Joe's problems become her problems and that's the way it should be. That sums their relationship up, really. She'll do anything for him because Gail can't let her dream go. To realise that he's the wrong man would spell the end of her dream, so she's not going to do it.\"\n\nIn 2009, Worth revealed in an interview with the \"Daily Mirror\" that she thought \"Coronation Street\" bosses were going to write the character out of the soap as an upcoming storyline would see her on trial for murder: \"At the time I was genuinely anxious as to whether it was the end of the road for me and \"Coronation Street\"... I wasn’t shocked, because it can happen to an actor at any time. But I was very pleased when I found out that whatever happens at Gail’s trial, I will be staying in the show.\"\n\nLes Dennis joined the show in 2014, as Michael Rodwell, who was being lined up as a love interest for Gail. Michael arrived in Weatherfield and burgled Gail's house, but returned later in the year to try to make amends with Gail as part of a restorative justice storyline. (The restorative justice scheme involves people who have admitted crimes meeting their victims or making amends by doing some sort of remedial work.) Gail would sacrifice everything for her relationship with Michael, in particular her relationship with son Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) who disapproved of the relationship. After just over two years, Rodwell was written out of the series, dying of a heart attack.\n\nOn 25 May 2014, Worth won \"Outstanding Achievement Award\" at The British Soap Awards 2014 for her portrayal of Gail over the last 40 years.\n\nOn 9 June 2014, a 30-minute documentary entitled \"\"Gail & Me: 40 Years on Coronation Street\"\" was aired at 20:00 dedicated to Worth's 40 years on the soap. In the show, Worth was reunited with past actors Brian Capron (Richard Hillman) and Amanda Barrie (Alma Halliwell), and spoke out about Gail's most controversial storylines.\n\n"}

It is a sequel to \"Starship Troopers\" (1997) and the second installment of the \"Starship Troopers\" film series. The film premiered on Encore Action on April 24, 2004 and was released on DVD on June 1, 2004; it was also released on VHS.\nIt was followed by the direct-to-video sequel \"\" in 2008.\n\nOn a planet inhabited by Arachnids, a squad of soldiers find themselves pinned down and surrounded by Arachnid forces—even with their new laser gun technology and assistance from psychic soldiers, the Arachnid assault overwhelms them. General Jack Shepherd (Ed Lauter) decides to make a last stand with four of his best soldiers to allow the majority of his surviving troops to escape. The plan works and the soldiers escape, including Sergeant Dede Rake (Brenda Strong), psychic Lieutenant Pavlov Dill (Lawrence Monoson), Private Jill Sandee (Sandrine Holt), her lover Private Duff Horton (Jason-Shane Scott), and Private Lei Sahara (Colleen Porch). Despite reaching relative safety, the team is whittled down by deadly storms and arachnid ambushes. Lieutenant Dill is unable to command his soldiers as he receives traumatic visions of utter annihilation. He takes his anger out on Private Sahara, who is revealed to have been psychic but lost reliable control of her psychic abilities during puberty.\n\nThe remaining refugees find themselves sheltering within Hotel Delta 1-8-5, an old and abandoned structure containing Captain V. J. Dax (Richard Burgi), a disgraced soldier with an outstanding combat record. Dax had killed his commanding officer and, as punishment, was sealed in a furnace. As a deadly dust storm kicks up, they find themselves without communications or back-up for a lengthy period of time and protect themselves with an electric pulse fence. Dax assumes command, to the annoyance of Dill; Dax sees Dill as an incompetent leader, while Dill sees Dax as a traitor to the Federation.\n\nSoon after defenses are set up, General Shepherd and three soldiers return. While the troops there first think that all but one of their comrades has reached safety, it becomes clear that all their comrades but Shepherd have died, and Shepherd has been rescued by three soldiers including comatose private Charlie Soda (Kelly Carlson); the strangely behaving technical sergeant Ari Peck (J. P. Manoux); and the medic, corporal Joe Griff (Ed Quinn). With the help of the newcomers they solve their technical issues, including lack of communication, and wait for a Fleet dropship to rescue them.\n\nAt the base, Soda showers and seduces Horton. Meanwhile, Sandee finds a new significant other in Griff, causing tempers to flare; however, both Horton and Sandee soon act strangely, as do many other survivors. Sahara seems to have become ill as she has nightmares and wakes up vomiting. Later she accidentally brushes Griff's hand and has a psychic vision. She goes to Rake for advice and tells her what has happened. Rake suggests that Sahara is simply pregnant, which can cause visions, make girls temperamental, and make them think that \"they know it all\". Eventually Sahara and Dax find themselves facing a new breed of Arachnid—a bug that infests the human body by entering through the mouth and propagating inside the brain. They go to Dill with their news and make amends with him, also learning that he made bad decisions only because of the visions he was having and that he feels incredibly guilty over the loss of men under his command during the escape. Sahara tells Dill that she has been receiving parts of the vision as well, and Dill tells Sahara that an occasional side-effect of pregnancy is a temporary return of the psychic abilities lost at puberty.\n\nSoon after making amends, Dill finds the general recently infected by Soda, whom, just as with Horton, she had seduced to transmit the mind-controlling bug. He attempts to capture Soda along with several infected soldiers to be dissected and studied, but as he rants about the horrors that await them, another infected soldier kills him with the knife that Dax had given him. The murder is blamed on Dax, his name having been inscribed on the knife prior, and he is imprisoned.\n\nAfter Dax is imprisoned, Rake is ambushed by the infected troopers. She takes multiple adrenaline shots, managing to wound one infected soldier and kill another before freeing Dax, but before the bug can take control her, she kills herself. A soldier attempts to infect Sahara, but she manages to kill him and escape. Sahara uses her restored psychic abilities to read the mind of the Arachnid that had attempted to control Rake's mind, and discovers the bugs plan: use General Shepherd to infest High Command, allowing the bugs to wipe out the human race and cause Sahara's vision to come true. Sahara and Dax kill the rest of the infected troops, and make it to the roof to confront the infected Shepherd just as the pulse fences fail. Shepherd is about to be rescued when Dax, dual-wielding rifles, kills him. He gets Sahara onto the ship and tells the bewildered crew that she holds information vital to the survival of the Federation. He then refuses to get onto the ship (\"\"Murderers don't go home!\"\") and dies in a blaze of glory while fending off the bugs.\n\nOne year later on Earth, Sahara, now discharged from the military, attends a recruiting seminar with her newborn infant son to speak about her experience, and of Dax's actions, which she credits for saving her life. Although Dax is labeled a Hero of the Federation, his death is shrouded in propaganda as the Federation uses his end as a means of recruitment. As Sahara leaves the recruiting station, the recruiting officer approaches her to thank her for attending and also tells her to raise her son well, as \"We need fresh meat for the grinder.\" Sahara is visibly alarmed and flees the recruiting station, while the recruiter smiles callously.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 33% based on 6 reviews. \nAndy Patrizio of IGN gave the film a \"mediocre\" rating, writing that \"Movies like this are why direct-to-video has yet to earn any respectability and is viewed as the home for bad movies\".\n\nThe film won the award for \"Best DVD Release\" at the 31st Saturn Awards in 2005.\n"}

{"id": "2275259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275259", "title": "Ottawa SuperEX", "text": "Ottawa SuperEX\n\nOttawa SuperEX (officially the Central Canada Exhibition) was an eleven-day annual exhibition that took place every August at Lansdowne Park in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The exhibition provided exhibits, entertainment and amusements indoors in the buildings on site and outdoors on the grounds. The Central Canada Exhibition Association operated a fair annually from 1888 until 2010, except during World War II. The fair was on hiatus due to plans to redevelop Lansdowne Park and the Association continued to work towards finding opportunities to bring back SuperEX. It was announced in December 2015 that the Ottawa SuperEX board had disbanded a year earlier and the Ex would not be returning.\n\nSingle exhibitions were held on the site in 1875, 1879, 1883 and 1888. The last of these exhibitions was opened on September 20, 1888 by Mr. Charles Magee, President of the Exhibition Association, with Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald and Governor General Lord Stanley in attendance.\n\nA decision was made to formalize an ongoing annual fair, resulting in the 1888 special event becoming the first of the annual fairs. The 1888 Exhibition Association evolved into a permanent organization, and a lease of the site was agreed to with the City of Ottawa.\n\nOnly a few buildings existed at the site at the time, including the first Grandstand, overlooking a dirt track and horse display area. This dirt track and horse display area has evolved into today's Frank Clair Stadium. The primary focus was on agricultural displays, but exhibits included manufacturer's exhibits from the beginning. Livestock was brought to the site and kept in sheds for the duration of the fair. Farm crafts and baking were judged.\n\nThe Exhibition operated annually, with the exception of several years during World War II, when the grounds were used by the Canadian military. In 1898, the Aberdeen Pavilion opened for displays. In 1903, the Coliseum opened for displays. In 1909 a new steel and concrete Grandstand was built at a cost of $100,000 to provide seating for nearly 10,000 people. The south side stands were built in 1960. Today's Civic Centre and Grandstand opened in 1967.\n\nStarting in 1974, the Exhibition Association worked to move the Exhibition to a new location, but the Exhibition never moved and in 1994, the City of Ottawa directed the Association to stop searching for a new location. During the period from 1974 to 1994, funds were set aside for the move, and several buildings fell into decline, notably the Aberdeen Pavilion. After the decision was made to keep the fair in place, the Aberdeen Pavilion was restored.\n\nOver time, the Exhibition reduced its agricultural exhibits to the point where there was only a small exhibit in the Aberdeen Pavilion. Musical concerts took place outdoors on the field and indoors in the Civic Centre arena.\n\nThe Ex was cancelled for 2011 because it had no site. The exhibition was to move to Albion Road, but the venue would not be ready for August 2011. It is the first time the exhibition has been cancelled since World War II. The suspension of the Ex left its existence in question, with no event held in 2012, 2013, 2014 or 2015. However, the Board continued to work towards finding opportunities to bring back SuperEX. It was announced in December 2015 that the Ottawa SuperEX board had disbanded a year earlier and the Ex would not be returning.\n\nSuperEx has a handful of buildings that survived re-development:\n\n\nMost other structures at the site have disappeared:\n\n\nWith the re-development of Lansdowne Park, most of the remaining structures were demolished after 2012. SuperEx would not be a tenant in the new development and would need to relocate. It was announced in December 2015 that the Ottawa SuperEX board had disbanded a year earlier and the Ex would not be returning.\n\nA highlight of the annual fair were the 'thrill rides.' These were set up on site by the rides provider, and dismantled after the fair is over. Ride safety was monitored by the Technical Safety Standards Authority of Ontario. From 1997 to 2010, World's Finest Shows, the former Conklin Shows of Brantford, Ontario, provided rides along with Campbell Amusements and Homeniuk Amusements. Prior to 1997 Amusements of America and World of Mirth Shows provided the midway.\n\nRides were offered since the first year of the fair.\n\nIn August 1998, Jerome Charron, recent graduate of École Secondaire Publique Charlebois, died in a reverse bungee ride accident at the Ottawa Exhibition when he was hurled 40 meters into the air before plummeting to his death after his harness detached. In February 2000, the firm responsible for the ride, Anderson Ventures, was fined $145,000 for this incident. Provincial inspectors had inspected the ride just 4 days before the incident and had approved it.\n\nWhile no fair or exhibits were held in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the former midway provider for SuperEx set up an annual midway of rides during the August time frame of SuperEx, called \"Ottawa Midway Magic.\" In 2011, it was held in the parking lot at Ottawa's baseball stadium. In 2012 and 2013, it was held at grounds adjacent to Rideau Carleton Raceway. In 2014, Ottawa Midway Magic was retired and the annual Gloucester Fair moved into the SuperEx time slot. It was renamed \"the Capital Fair\".\n\nThe Ottawa SuperEX attracted many musical performances. Stages included the Chez Stage, the Pizza Pizza Stage, the Direct Energy Pure Country Pavilion, the Giant Tiger stage and the SUPER Stage.\n\nIn 2005, the Solo Mobile / Eckored tour stopped at Lansdowne Park on August 25 to perform at the Ottawa SuperEX. It featured four solo female singers: Keshia Chanté, Amanda Stott, Christine Evans and Cassie Steele. They played on the SUPER Stage at 20h, and the concert was included at no extra charge with the SuperEX admission.\n\nHedley, Massari and other artists performed at SuperEX in 2006. Like the Keshia Chanté concert, only an admission to SuperEX was required to attend the concert.\n\nWhile The Rolling Stones played at the Frank Clair Stadium during the SuperEX of 2005, the show required a separate ticket. The \"Weird Al\" Yankovic concert on August 22 took place in the Ottawa Civic Centre and also required a separate admission, as did other concerts over the latter years.\n\nOther Canadian annual fairs (not a complete list) \n\n"}

{"id": "2275264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275264", "title": "Elizabeth Costello", "text": "Elizabeth Costello\n\nIn this novel, Elizabeth Costello, a celebrated aging Australian writer, travels around the world and gives lectures on topics including the lives of animals and literary censorship. In her youth, Costello wrote \"The House on Eccles Street,\" a novel that re-tells James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" from the perspective of the protagonist's wife, Molly Bloom. Costello, becoming weary from old age, confronts her fame, which seems further and further removed from who she has become, and struggles with issues of belief, vegetarianism, sexuality, language and evil. Many of the lectures Costello gives are edited fragments that Coetzee had previously published. The lessons she delivers only tenuously speak to the work for which she is being honored. Of note, Elizabeth Costello is the main character in Coetzee's academic novel, \"The Lives of Animals\" (1999). A character named Elizabeth Costello also appears in Coetzee's 2005 novel \"Slow Man\" and Coetzee's 2011 short story \"Lies\" is about a woman with the last name Costello.\n\nA renowned writer, Elizabeth Costello has to put up with a large number of various inconveniences. First of all, she is a sixty-six-year-old woman who has committed all her life to writing, often neglecting not only her own needs but her children in order to give all her strengths to her work. Due to the fact that her first novel is about women's liberation, her interviewers – usually women who write books about her – expect that she will be an energetic fighter for equality, who eagerly discusses the importance of a woman's role in modern society. They are extremely disappointed to see an elderly woman, who is sick and tired of discussing her first book.\n\nAccompanied by her son John, she comes to Pennsylvania to receive the Stowe Award. During her acceptance speech, she speaks about Kafka and the audience finds it difficult to follow her idea, for this kind of talk is not to their liking. It seems that there is a gap between her and her audience. Although public speaking becomes a challenge for her, she decides to take a cruise in which she is supposed to speak about realism. The applause she gets is unenthusiastic.\n\nNot only the does the public not understand what she wants them to realize, but neither does her own family. Elizabeth's vegetarianism often provokes quarrels between her and her daughter-in-law. Her son is torn between love for his mother and difficulties in accepting her point of view. More often than not, he asks himself why she can't be just like any other elderly woman. The truth is that she doesn't know the answer herself. She speaks about the things people don't want to know, because she feels the need to do it.\n\nElizabeth has a sister she hasn't seen for a long period of time. She lives in Africa and serves in the Marian Order. The sisters have a very little in common. During the graduation ceremony they both are invited to, Blanche criticizes the humanities. Their parting is bitter, for they know that they see each other for the last time. Blanche says that Elizabeth chooses the wrong Greeks, which means that she doesn't support philosophical ideas her sister is so fond of.\n\nFor now, Elizabeth is in a certain kind of limbo, where she is supposed to explain what she believes in, so that she could pass through the gate. She is supposed to do it in front of the court. Her first attempt is a complete failure, for she says the truth and claims that she doesn't believe in anything. She has another try, but the novel ends before she finds out whether she is going to pass through the gate or not.\n\nElizabeth Costello frequently engages philosophers and their ideas. Among the philosophers mentioned by name are historical figures such as Aristotle, Porphyry, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, René Descartes and Jeremy Bentham, as well as contemporary figures such as Mary Midgley, Tom Regan and Thomas Nagel. In addition two minor characters, Elaine Marx and an academic named Arendt (whose first name is not mentioned) share surnames with the famous philosophers Karl Marx and Hannah Arendt. The frequent allusions to philosophers have caused critics to debate whether there are philosophical themes in Coetzee's work and, if so, what they might be.\n\nPart of the debate has focused on similarities between ideas expressed by Coetzee's protagonist and the philosophy of Mary Midgley. Coetzee's protagonist for example is concerned with the moral status of animals, a subject Midgley addressed in her 1983 book \"Animals and Why They Matter\". Midgley has also criticized Marx and other philosophers for singling out one human attribute (in Marx's case, that of freely given labour) and proclaiming it to be the unique quality that elevates human life above that of animals. Midgley argues that this approach confuses a factual claim and a moral claim, and it has been suggested that \"Elizabeth Costello\" draws attention to the same shortcoming in Arendt. As one analysis of \"Elizabeth Costello\" puts it, “The problem with Marx’s view is that there are human activities in which people find considerable value, such as giving birth, that are capacities we share with animals. Similarly, there are some actions, such as committing suicide, that may be unique to human beings yet that we do not celebrate. Like Marx, Hannah Arendt lauds one particular human attribute, in her case our capacity to take part in a shared world of political speech and action, on the grounds that it is what separates us from animals. There is a certain casual brilliance in the way Coetzee extends Midgley’s critique of Marx to Arendt, whose philosophy is often thought to invert Marxism.” \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2275272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275272", "title": "Vera Duckworth", "text": "Vera Duckworth\n\nVera Duckworth (also Burton) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera \"Coronation Street\", portrayed by Liz Dawn. Vera is known for her long-standing marriage to Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey); they became one of the best-loved couples in television history. Vera was often shown in a comedic light.\n\nShe first appeared on 19 August 1974 and last appeared on 18 January 2008, where the character peacefully died in her sleep at the age of 70 from heart failure. She reappeared posthumously for a single appearance on the 8 November 2010 episode, in which her husband Jack died.\n\nVera first appeared working in the Mark Brittan mail order warehouse on \"Coronation Street\", and formed a friendship with Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie). Vera later moved into the street, much to the dismay of her new neighbours. Although it was originally stated that Vera was divorced, that was later overlooked when her husband Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) was introduced. They argued frequently although she still made an effort with Jack, often using the comically spoken phrase \"Don't you love me any more, Jack?\". Despite their problems, Jack and Vera cared about each other.\n\nThe Duckworth marriage was always rocky due to their wayward son, Terry (Nigel Pivaro), and extramarital flings. Jack once had an affair with Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), and went on a dating programme in which he donned a wig, fake name, Vince St Clair, and French accent. Bet joined the dating programme and was shocked to see Jack's video. She encouraged Vera to go, especially to see a video of a man named \"Vince\". Vera and the other girls then launched a plot for her to get even with Jack. Claiming she was a young widow, Vera arranged to meet \"Vince\" at The Rovers Return Inn. She was wearing a ginger wig as he approached her from behind, then slowly turned around to face Jack much to the amusement of the pub crowd who were in on the joke.\n\nVera got a job at Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) clothing factory – Baldwins Casuals. Vera worked at the factory as a machinist, working alongside many of the street's residents including Ivy, Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix), Ida Clough (Helene Palmer), Shirley Armitage (Lisa Lewis), Ernest Bishop (Stephen Hancock) and Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire). After working at the factory for many years, Mike sold it in to developers, and it was demolished, leaving Vera out of a job until she had a career change when her lodger Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) got her a job at Bettabuys supermarket, working under boss Reg Holdsworth (Ken Morley).\n\nWhen the Duckworths inherited some money after Jack's brother died, they bought The Rovers Return, with Vera becoming the landlady. However they later sold it to Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough). Vera and Jack moved into Eunice Gee's (Meg Johnson) B&B, and when Eunice moved to Spain to help her sister run a bar, she left Vera and Jack as managers of the B&B. When Eunice sold the business, Vera decided to slow down a bit and got a job in \"Roy's Rolls\" café, working alongside Roy Cropper (David Neilson), Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh), Frankie Baldwin (Debra Stephenson) and Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly).\nJack and Vera took in lodger Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) who became somewhat of a surrogate son to them. Vera became restricted to her house due to an injury to her ankle and was cared by Tyrone and Molly Compton (Vicky Binns). They bought her a baby monitor so Jack, Molly and Tyrone could talk to Vera while they were in the pub. Later, Jack and Vera's grandson Paul Clayton (Tom Hudson) arrived on the street but little did Vera know that Paul was scamming Jack and Vera out of money, stealing money from Jack and blaming it on Tyrone. Vera was disappointed in Tyrone but Molly was adamant that Tyrone hadn't stolen the money. Vera refused to believe this of Molly and could never believe that her own flesh and blood could steal from her. Vera decided that she and Jack were to move to their dream place of Blackpool but Paul was forced to confess to Jack that he had stolen the money for the house. Jack was appalled but had to keep it secret from Vera as he didn't want to hurt her and destroy her dreams. Vera still desperately wanted to move to Blackpool so Jack eventually told Vera that he spent a lot of the money they saved to help Paul buy his half of the restaurant, but added the excuse that he spent it before he knew they were going to Blackpool. Jack knew that if he told Vera the truth she would be heart broken and she was still greatly upset and went to bed to get over the shock.\n\nOne night, Vera complained about her shoes and Jack sat her down and pulled them off. Vera told Jack that she loved him and she had never loved any one else and pushed Jack to say the same. A little reluctantly, as always, he did and grabbed her slippers for her. He then said that he was going to go to The Rovers for a short while and although Vera tried to insist on him staying with her, he said he wouldn't be long and he had been with Vera all day and needed some time to relax. When he returned, Vera had died peacefully in her sleep. Jack remained calm and kept Vera warm. When the paramedics arrived, they explained that Vera had died from heart failure in her sleep but said that she hadn't experienced any pain.\n\nOver two years later, shortly before dying Jack sees a vision of Vera and they both dance together.\n\nOriginally, actress Liz Dawn was only contracted for a couple of episodes, but producers saw potential in the character of Vera and brought her back two years later for another short stint, before finally making Vera a regular from December 1976. The character remained in the series until 2008, when due to Dawn wanting to leave the show because of ill health, the character was killed off.\n\nVera's relationship with Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) was always up and down, they had a rocky marriage and sometimes Jack appeared to show little care for her. Tarmey describes the first few decades in the following manner: \"He would never knowingly hurt people and he loves Vera, although he doesn't always like her. He will defend her to the death, unless the chap slagging her off is bigger than he is! Jack is not a thief either!\" In their \"hey-day\" they were dubbed as the modern day Stan (Bernard Youens) and Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander). In their early days, Jack and Vera both had their fair share of dalliances. In 1982, whilst Vera was entertaining her own boyfriend, Jack had developed an attraction towards Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear). They believed the storyline was a turning point for the two and was written with wit. Dawn opines: \"It was very cleverly written, because Vera knew that Jack had a girlfriend on the side but she didn't know the other woman was Bet. So she chose Bet as someone to confide in, and she really opened her heart. It was quite moving as well as funny.\" This led to classic showdown in the Rovers.\n\nOn 23 August 2010, it was confirmed that the actress would make a one-off appearance as the ghost of Vera Duckworth. The episode was broadcast on 8 November 2010. Husband Jack died from incurable cancer and the scene was a reunion for the two characters. Producer Phil Collinson explained his why they decided to include her: \"It's something I've heard a lot. People say, 'When my mother was dying she saw my father' [...] It's a story I've heard a few people say. We're storytellers at the end of the day. Yes it's Coronation Street and yes it reflects real life, but we're storytellers.\" Whilst Executive producer Kieran Roberts opined that he would be surprised if anyone thought it was the wrong decision.\n\nOn 23 July 2007, it was announced that Dawn had quit her role as Vera and would depart the following year. Speaking of her departure Dawn said: \"It's been an amazing 34 years, I'd like to thank everyone for what has been the best time of my life.\" \"We're indebted to her for all she has achieved during her years as Vera Duckworth,\" said \"Coronation Street\" executive producer Kieran Roberts. \"We will always miss this wonderful lady and first rate actress and we are delighted she's agreed to return to the soap in the future.\" It was originally reported that producers were devising storylines for her character's departure, but will leave the door open for the guest appearances Liz has already agreed to. On 30 October 2007, it was reported that Vera would be killed off with her death being screened in the New Year. A spokeswoman said: \"Three alternative endings have been written, but each will see Vera leaving husband Jack, family and friends devastated.\" Dawn admitted that she was pleased that Vera was killed off. \"It is going to be very emotional filming Vera's death scenes but I do think it is the right decision for the character.\" Dawn said in an interview. Dawn's co-star Sally Whittaker who plays Sally Webster said Liz would be sadly missed by the cast and the soap would \"never be the same again\". Vera's death scenes were screened in episodes aired in January 2008.\n\n\"The Guardian\" columnist Grace Dent spoke with sadness of the passing of Vera Duckworth: \"Saddest news on \"Corrie\" this month was the passing of street legend Vera Duckworth, leaving her husband and soulmate Jack to wander the cobbles alone. The final era of Vera was actually quite painful to witness. Vera's storyline, spanning 33 years, had no real big bangs or final flourish. Instead, Vera sat quietly, trapped on her sofa, dreaming of a house move to glamorous Blackpool which we all knew would never come. She was still broke, still being conned by errant family members, still one of life's noisy malcontents, but not the formidable force she once was. Regardless, it still felt to me like she'd go on forever, until the undertakers carried her away over the cobbles in a box, while Jack watched from the doorstep in hang-dog faced bewilderment.\"\n\n12.5 million viewers tuned in to see the departure of the long serving and popular character. Jim Shelley called Jack's death scene with the ghostly appearance of Vera, \"one of the most moving scenes ever seen in soap\".\n"}

{"id": "2275305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275305", "title": "Blanche Hunt", "text": "Blanche Hunt\n\nBlanche Hunt (also Linfield) was a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, \"Coronation Street\". She was originally played by Patricia Cutts; however, the actress committed suicide after appearing in just two episodes in August 1974. Maggie Jones took over the role, playing Blanche in over 830 episodes from 1974 to her death in December 2009. The character subsequently died off screen in May 2010. Blanche was the mother of Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride), grandmother of Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) and great-grandmother of Amy. Her storylines have revolved around her family life, various romances and her \"acerbic tongue\". The character's \"gallows humour\" has been well received by critics, and saw Jones win The British Soap Award for \"Best Comedy Performance\" in 2005 and 2008. Blanche has been described as \"a true \"Coronation Street\" icon\".\n\nBlanche is introduced as the widowed mother of Deirdre Hunt (Anne Kirkbride). Her bank manager husband, Donald, died in January 1963 after being knocked down outside their house by a black Ford Prefect. Blanche immediately makes her mark by slapping Deirdre's suitor, Ray Langton (Neville Buswell), when she thinks he's treating her daughter badly; she is quick to criticize Dierdre when she disapproves of her behaviour. Blanche originally runs a corset business from home but later takes jobs as a barmaid at The Rovers Return and helps Gordon Clegg (Bill Kenwright) run the corner shop.\n\nIn 1976, she meets bookmaker Dave Smith (Reginald Marsh), with whom she had a wartime romance. They rekindle their affair and decides to move away to help Dave run his country club in Kenilworth. After her affair with Dave Smith ends, Blanche returns to Weatherfield in January 1977 to help look after her newborn granddaughter Tracy (Christabel Finch), accompanied by Warwickshire vet, Steve Bassett (Dennis Chinnery). They become engaged but split up that May. In 1981, Blanche returns to Weatherfield for Deirdre's wedding to Ken Barlow (William Roache).\n\nIn December 1993, Blanche has a stroke (off-screen) and Deirdre goes to stay with her to nurse her (a storyline devised to cover Anne Kirkbride's sick leave). Deirdre returns to Weatherfield the following year after Blanche has made a full recovery. Blanche briefly returns to Weatherfield in 1996 when Tracy (now played by Dawn Acton) gets married and again in 1998 after Deirdre is sent to prison, following a wrongful conviction for fraud. Blanche begins matchmaking between the divorced Deirdre and Ken, believing Ken is good for Deirdre. She fails but Tracy gets them to reconcile and in 1999, Blanche returns permanently and moves in with the reunited couple.\n\nBlanche quickly gains a reputation as a gossip and a meddler, with Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) often being the target of Blanche's acid tongue when her 13-year-old granddaughter, Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien), becomes pregnant. She makes hurtful comments at Sarah but backs down after the birth of her baby daughter, Bethany, when she finally stands up to Blanche and tells her to leave her and her daughter alone. Blanche briefly becomes Rita Sullivan's (Barbara Knox) assistant at \"The Kabin\" but soon drives Rita mad with her meddling and tactlessness. In 2002, Blanche has a new suitor, funeral director Archie Shuttleworth (Roy Hudd) but is unhappy when he makes friends with Audrey. Blanche suspects they are having an affair but later discovers Audrey, a hairdresser, is working with Archie to dress dead bodies for viewings. Archie is angry when Blanche spreads this around and ends their relationship. Blanche is upset but later moves on to supposedly wealthy retiree, Wally Bannister (Bernard Cribbins). Wally is more interested in Tracy (now played by Kate Ford), who simply wants Wally's money and decides to seduce him. This falls flat when Tracy visits Wally's house and discovers that he's actually the gardener, posing as the owner and isn't rich at all. Ken and Deirdre find out and disgusted with their daughter, decide to keep the news from Blanche (who is away visiting her sister) to avoid upsetting her.\n\nWhen Tracy falls pregnant, she tells Roy Cropper (David Neilson) and his wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh), that Roy is the father and tells them that she will have a termination if they do not want to adopt it. Blanche tries to persuade Tracy to keep the baby by buying No. 7 Coronation Street for them to live in, upsetting Deirdre, who wonders why Blanche never bought a house for her. Tracy gives birth to a daughter and gives the baby to the Croppers, who name her Patience; Blanche sees through Tracy's \"indifference\" and encourages her to fight for her daughter. Tracy breaks down and Blanche enlists Ken and Deirdre's help to get the baby back. Although they are disgusted when Hayley reveals Tracy sold her daughter for £25,000. Blanche, Ken and Deirdre stand by Tracy, who reclaims her daughter and renames her Amy (Elle Mulvaney). Blanche is relieved when Tracy later admits Roy isn't the real father. When Tracy and Amy visit Peter (Chris Gascoyne) in Portsmouth, Blanche moves back in with Ken and Deirdre, renting (and later selling) the house to Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh). Struggling with a bad hip, Blanche considers using some of the money for a private hip replacement operation but later has the operation in Poland where it is cheaper.\n\nIn 2007, Blanche supports Tracy when she is accused of murdering her lover Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). When Tracy is found guilty Ken refuses to support her and walks out on Deirdre, who knew Tracy was guilty. Blanche worries that her family is disintegrating and is relieved when Ken and Deirdre reconcile. On 25 June 2007 Blanche holds a mock wake for herself to gauge which of her friends truly appreciate her. She is upset by the low attendance and hearing her friends castigate her negative traits. She resolves briefly to be nicer to everyone but quickly reverts to type, believing people should accept her for who she is.\n\nIn 2008 Blanche shows her softer side, becoming close to Peter's son Simon (Alex Bain), who finds Blanche's outspoken ways amusing. Blanche is visibly upset when alcoholic Peter turns up drunk to Simon's nativity play and ruins things. In May 2009, Deirdre discovers that Ken has been having an affair with actress Martha Fraser (Stephanie Beacham). When Deirdre takes Ken back, Blanche is incredulous; tired of her mother's interference, Deirdre orders Blanche to move out of their home. She moves in briefly with Peter, returning to live with Ken and Deirdre after apologising a few weeks later. Blanche often makes barbed references to the event, telling everyone at Peter's AA meeting that \"Ken recently had an affair with an actress. Oh - it wasn't Nicole Kidman or Glenda Jackson. She lived on a tugboat\". Blanche's tactlessness struck again later that year when Simon's maternal grandparents visited and after one too many drinks, she blurted out that Deirdre had been to prison, Ken had had numerous affairs, Peter was an alcoholic and his fiancée Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) was a former prostitute.\n\nBlanche's final scenes aired on 11 December 2009, just days after Maggie Jones' death. In the subsequent episodes, it was revealed that Blanche had unexpectedly been offered a free holiday in Portugal by her friend May and would be spending Christmas abroad. When May hurts her leg Blanche stays on to nurse her. On 3 May 2010 Blanche was due to return; when Peter goes to collect her at the airport he discovers Blanche has died earlier that day, devastating Deirdre. May (June Whitfield) later arrives and explains that the real reason Blanche had stayed in Portugal for so long is that she had fallen in love and become engaged to a man named Arnold. Deirdre is surprised Blanche never told her - and even more surprised to hear Blanche regularly spoke of how proud she was of her daughter \"Dee-Dee\".\n\nKen later finds instructions left by Blanche for her funeral, plus a request for a formal will reading. Blanche leaves her dog Eccles to Ken, with a final barbed comment that he shouldn't take her for walks near canals and theatres (\"where women of ill-repute may gather\"). She also makes a dig at Ken's attempts to creative writing, leaving him her Maeve Binchy book collection and describing her as 'a proper writer'. She also leaves her jewellery to Deirdre, claiming she knew Deirdre had her eye on it, an imitation silver music box to Amy and her late husband Donald's fob watch to Simon. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) is also invited to the reading but all Blanche has 'left' him is the chance to be the first to spread details of the will around the street, the only time he would get his hands on a piece of gossip before she did.\n\nBlanche was originally played by Patricia Cutts but committed suicide after appearing in only two episodes. The role was re-cast and given to Maggie Jones, who had also auditioned for the part. She accepted the role at short notice, as storylines for Blanche had already been written. Jones had previously appeared in the show in minor roles in the 1960s, as a policewoman and a shoplifter. She appeared in the soap as a series regular from 1974–1976, making brief reappearances in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1996 and 1997. She returned as a series regular in 1998.\n\nJones suffered long periods of ill-health in 1999 and 2003 and took time out of the show to recover. Blanche was again written out of the series in October 2009 while Jones recovered from an operation but she never resumed the role, dying on 2 December 2009. Co-star William Roache stated: \"I don't think Maggie ever realised how much she was loved not only by everyone on the show but by the millions of Blanche fans out there. She will be greatly missed\". Blanche's final scene was broadcast on 11 December 2009, with the 3 December 2009 episode of \"Coronation Street\" dedicated to Jones. The producers decided that Blanche would also die. In May 2010 Blanche's friend May (June Whitfield) arrives from Portugal, where Blanche has been staying with her, to break the news of her death.\n\nBlanche has been well received by critics and \"Coronation Street\" fans. TV critic Patrick Freyne has said of the character: \"...Blanche is all curmudgeonly gallows humour and insensitivity; she gets all the best one liners...\" In the same article he also praised the quality of writing for the older characters on \"Coronation Street\": \"with all the young people wandering around on TV nowadays, with their slang, texting and hippity-hop, it's great to see \"Coronation Street\" can still write fantastic older characters. There's prissy, kvetching Norris, long-suffering Rita and saintly Emily. But best of all there's Blanche Hunt, played by Maggie Jones, mother of Deirdre (formerly of the huge glasses) and tormentor of Deirdre's husband Ken...\" BBC News named Blanche \"Weatherfield's best-loved battle-axe\", praising her \"brutal honesty and withering put-downs\". The \"Daily Mirror\" lauded Jones' \"superb comic timing\" in the role. At the 2005 and 2008 British Soap Awards, Maggie Jones won the award for \"Best Comedy Performance\" for her role as Blanche. She also won \"Funniest Performance\" at the 2009 \"Inside Soap\" awards. Jones commented at the time that she did not find Blanche funny, explaining:\n\nPop star George Michael stated that Blanche was his favourite soap character, commenting: \"When you're as old as her you can get away with saying anything.\" Following Jones' death, \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote in her obituary: \"As a deft exponent of Blanche’s withering one-liners and put-downs, Maggie Jones made the part her own, stealing scene after scene as the acid-tongued widowed mother of Deirdre [...] Maggie Jones's portrayal of Blanche as a meddlesome busybody was beautifully judged and finely understated.\" They deemed Blanche \"a long-term favourite of \"Coronation Street\" fans\", appraising: \"With her trademark scowl and folded arms, Blanche epitomised the tyrannical mother-in-law as portrayed on the seaside postcard.\" Tim Teeman of \"The Times\" appraised: \"To many \"Coronation Street\" fans Blanche was a finer battleaxe than the legendary Ena Sharples (Violet Carson). To many (including myself), Blanche [...] was our favourite character. She gleefully defied the maxim that if you hadn’t anything nice to say about somebody, you shouldn’t bother saying it. Instead, she broadcast her malevolence from the rooftops and to her victims' astonished, deeply offended faces.\" Teeman called Jones a \"brilliant actress\" and noted: \"Blanche could be kind, but not often. She and Norris were the great gossip-mongering tag team of the Street, revelling in others' misfortune. Blanche often didn’t have to say anything at all. She’d just purse her lips. That was withering condemnation enough.\" \"Low Culture\" columnist Ruth Deller praised the work of the late Maggie Jones by stating: \"even from beyond the grave, she delivered one of Corrie’s best storylines, with the reading of her will providing some classic Blanche moments. She’ll be sorely missed.\"\n"}

The game is part of the \"WWF SmackDown!\" (later renamed \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw\", then \"WWE\" and now WWE 2K) series based on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) professional wrestling promotion. It is also the sequel to \"\", released in November 2001, and was succeeded by \"WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth\" in October 2002. This was the first game in the series to be featured on the PlayStation 2. It is also the last game in the series named under the \"WWF\" banner.\n\nThis was the first game in the series to feature commentary, with Michael Cole and Tazz featured as the announcers. One improvement in this game is the appearance of six-man tag team matches, as well as six-man and eight-man battle royals (elimination matches; the latter being the only game in the series until the release of \"WWE 2K18\"). Additionally, this was the first game of the series to give each wrestler two finishing moves, as well as the first to allow editing of the in-game wrestlers' move sets. \"Just Bring It\" was also the first game in the series to feature authentic, complete ring entrances. The game features several venues from 2000 and 2001, including the arena for \"Raw Is War\" and both the original and new arenas for \"SmackDown!\" (Ovaltron, including the \"Sunday Night Heat\" version, and the Fist stages). However, all pay-per-view arenas (except for WrestleMania X-Seven and Insurrextion) has the same arena with different logos on the ring mat, with the arena being based from WrestleMania 2000.\n\nThe game's roster was criticised at the time for being outdated, as it was finalised very early in WWF's Invasion angle and prior to the emergence of several former ECW and WCW wrestlers. Whilst William Regal, Raven, Rhyno, Tajiri, Spike Dudley, Jerry Lynn and Molly Holly were new additions to the game, several stars who had become more prominent, such as Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, The Hurricane, Lance Storm and Mike Awesome were not, which was reflected by the inclusion of Fully Loaded 2000 as one of the featured pay-per-view mats over Invasion. In addition to these, Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst appears in the game as a condition of allowing \"Rollin' \" to be included as The Undertaker's then-theme music (it is one of his only two game appearances, as he also appears in \"WWF Raw\" for the Xbox). This is the only WWF game in which Jerry Lynn appears, as he would be gone from the company within five months of its release.\n\nRather than the Season Modes presented in the previous \"SmackDown!\" games, \"Just Bring It\" has a Story Mode. The player is given more control over their wrestler's activities in \"Just Bring It\"'s Story Mode, such as having the ability to choose which WWF title to go after. Throughout Story Mode, the player is able to attain unlockables, including additional superstars.\n\nThe game ended up selling more than 400,000 units in North America, to which it was added to the Sony Greatest Hits collection for the PlayStation 2 on 17 October 2002 and became THQ's second Greatest Hits game, only bested by \"Red Faction\". However, when the game was re-released, it was renamed to \"WWE SmackDown! Just Bring It\" because of the World Wrestling Federation's recently lost worldwide court battle to the World Wildlife Fund, to which the World Wrestling Federation was renamed to the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), although in-game branding were not changed.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. However, the game's in-game commentary has been criticized for being disjointed and repetitive, with noticeable pauses when calling wrestler or move names. Gary Whitta of \"Next Generation\" said, \"Marred by some serious flaws and a jarring lack of atmosphere, \"Just Bring It\" still delivers a few rasslin' thrills.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 29 out of 40.\n\nIt received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

It traces its heritage to a school for choirboys founded in the grounds of Gloucester Cathedral as early as the 12th century and was one of seven 'King's Schools' established, or re-endowed and renamed by King Henry VIII in 1541 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n\nThe current school was officially founded in 1541 as a direct consequence of the English Reformation, by a direct royal proclamation of King Henry VIII. However, there had been a school in the grounds of Gloucester Cathedral ever since it was first built as the Abbey of St. Peter around the year 1100. Today the junior school still educates the choirboys and choirgirls of the cathedral.\n\nIn 1540, during the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII closed down the Abbey of St. Peter at Gloucester. In its place, by statutes of 1545, Henry established the cathedral and a school known as the \"College School\". Henry VIII's statutes required the master of the school to be \"skilful in Latin and Greek, of good fame, and a godly life, well qualified for teaching, who may train up in piety those children who shall resort to our school for grammar\". In 1616 the controversial reformer William Laud was appointed Dean of Gloucester. As a result, the school became a victim of the religious disputes which led to the outbreak of the Civil War by 1642. Laud was executed during the war. In 1649, Parliament, following its victory in the Civil War, abolished Deans and Chapters. However, the school was considered too valuable a resource to be dispensed with.\n\nAfter enduring a tumultuous time during the 17th century, the school experienced significant growth from the 18th century onwards. Under headmaster Maurice Wheeler, reforms were instituted throughout the school. Cathedral choristers were fully integrated as pupils; previously they had been educated in separate classes. Physical education was introduced as a mandatory \"subject\". It was during his term that the school began to be referred to as \"The King's School\".\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the school went into decline, mainly due to financial difficulties, the rise of other public schools and the unwillingness of the Dean and Chapter to maintain more than a \"music school\". Through the efforts of then headmaster Francis Gillespy, funds were raised and the pupil roll gradually increased again. More buildings were bought and added to the campus and Archdeacon Meadow was upgraded.\n\nIn 2010, the ISI Inspection Report described the school as having \"a positive attitude to study and high standards of behaviour\" and commended its music programme.\n\nThe school is based around Pitt Street in the centre of Gloucester. It is near Gloucester Cathedral and has assemblies there every morning, which the whole school attends. Most public examinations are held in the Chapter House. The school is based in several buildings: The Palace, the Mathematics Centre, Little Cloister House (the oldest part of the school, containing the oldest functioning classroom in the world ), Sixth Form Centre Dulverton House, (the former residence of the Bishop of Tewkesbury), the Gym (formerly the main school building), the Art, Textiles and Design Technology department buildings, the Science block, the music school, Wardle House (the Nursery) and the Anniversary Building (Junior School).\n\nThe school is divided into three age groups:\n\nPupils are divided into Houses; in the Senior School they are Laud, Wheeler and Serlo, named after, respectively, Archbishop William Laud, Maurice Wheeler, a former headmaster, and Abbot Serlo, an important figure in the founding of Gloucester Cathedral. There are House competitions all year round, including sports, music and quizzes.\n\nThe school owns Archdeacon Meadow, which was given as a gift to the school by the people of Gloucester. Archdeacon Meadow is used as a sports field for rugby and cricket for the boys, and rounders in the summer for the girls. House cross-country running is also usually held there. The Meadow was the home of the annual Gloucester Cricket Festival until it was scrapped in 2009.\n\n\n7. https://www.thekingsschool.co.uk/\n\n"}

He was tried by the Parliament of St. Andrews the following year, and being found guilty of treason only saved his life through the intercession of the Marquess of Argyll. Following his release at the end of 1646, he was knighted by King Charles I. Subsequently, he joined Charles II and was made a Baronet, of Carrington in the County of Selkirk, dated 1 August 1651, at Woodhouse, during the march to Worcester.\n\nAs a consequence of his loyalty to the Crown his estate was sequestrated and his debtors prohibited from paying what they owed to him. He was also deprived of his office by the Act of Classes, the decree against him being sealed on 10 March 1649. Upon the repeal of this Act, and having given testimony of the satisfaction afforded by him to The Church, he was declared capable again of office on 10 January 1651, and was appointed Clerk to the Committee of Estates on 6 June following.\n\nAt the Restoration he was appointed Lord Clerk Register by Letters Patent dated 7 August 1660, and on 14 February 1661 was nominated a Lord of Session with the judicial title Lord Carrington. At the same time he was appointed a Lord of Exchequer, and a Privy Counsellor. He was the principal author of the Rescissory Act 1661, which ended Presbyterianism until the Act of 1690 re-established it again.\n\nThe enmity of the Duke of Lauderdale forced him to resign as Lord of Exchequer and Lord Clerk Register on 11 June 1676, in exchange for the far less lucrative one of Lord Justice General. He was deprived of this office in 1678.\n\nPrimrose died in November 1679, and was buried within Dalmeny church.

The action was also known as Operation Dulcinea, the code name given by its chief architect and leader, Portuguese military officer, writer and politician Henrique Galvão, who had been exiled in Caracas, Venezuela since 1959. After United States naval intervention, the ship arrived in Brazil, and the hijacking ended on 2 February when the rebels were given political asylum there.\n\nOwned by the Lisbon-based Companhia Colonial de Navegação, the 20,900-ton ship was the second largest ship in the Portuguese merchant navy at the time, and along with her sister ship, \"Vera Cruz\" was among the most luxurious Portuguese-flag liners.\n\nThe ship was primarily used for colonial trade to the Portuguese overseas provinces of Angola and Mozambique, in Africa, and migrant transportation to Brazil. The ship's mid-Atlantic service was also viewed as rather out of the ordinary: Lisbon to Madeira, to Tenerife, to La Guaira, to Curaçao, to Havana (later San Juan), and lastly Port Everglades. The average trade for this gray-hulled ship was mostly migrants to Venezuela and the general passenger traffic.\n\nOn 22 January 1961, the ship had 600 passengers and 300 crew members. Among the passengers were men, women, children, and 24 Iberian leftists led by Henrique Galvão.\nHenrique Galvão was a Portuguese military officer and political opponent of Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar, the head of the Estado Novo regime. Galvão had carefully planned the hijacking in Caracas with the intention of waging war until Salazar was overthrown in Portugal and the overseas territories were subsequently offered independence. He planned on using the hijacking as a way to bring attention to the Estado Novo in Portugal and the related fascist regime in Francoist Spain.\nThe rebels had boarded the ship in La Guaira (Venezuela) and in Willemstad (Curaçao), disguised as passengers, bringing aboard suitcases that had secret compartments to hide their weapons. In the early hours of 22 January, rebels, along with Henrique Galvao, seized the ship and shut down all communication. One officer (3rd Pilot Nascimento Costa) was killed and several others wounded in the process of taking control of the ship. The rebels forced Captain Mário Simões Maia and his crew to divert the ship eastwards. The next day they called at Saint Lucia, then a British possession, to drop off Costa's body and some injured crewmen in a launch; but, speaking only Portuguese, the sailors were unable to successfully communicate what had happened to their ship until after it had left.\n\nThe whereabouts of the ship then remained unknown for several days, until an extensive air and sea search by the Americans, British, and Dutch discovered her and established communication in mid-Atlantic. Subsequently, a United States Navy fleet, including four destroyers and , which carried a detachment of Marines from \"G\" Company, 2nd Battalion of the 6th Marine Regiment from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina) under the overall command of Rear Admiral Allen E. Smith. The force cut short Galvão's plans, when they surrounded \"Santa Maria\" some off Recife, Brazil. The following day, Admiral Smith left his flagship, , and proceeded via launch to \"Santa Maria\" to begin negotiations with Galvão.\n\nBecause of an anticipated change of presidency in Brazil (the incoming President Jânio Quadros being more sympathetic to Galvão's political interests), it was not until the next day that \"Santa Maria\", surrounded by United States naval vessels, entered the harbor of Recife. There, on 2 February, Galvão and his 24 activists surrendered \"Santa Maria\", 600 passengers and crew of 300 to Brazilian authorities in exchange for political asylum.\n\nGalvão later announced that his intention had been to sail to Angola, to set up a rebel Portuguese government in opposition to Salazar.\n\nHenrique Galvão wrote his account of the hijacking as \"A Minha Cruzada Pró-Portugal. Santa Maria\" (São Paulo, Livraria Martins, 1961), translated as \"Santa Maria: my crusade for Portugal\" (Cleveland OH, World Publishing/London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1961).\n\nThe story of the hijacking was told in the 2010 Portuguese feature film .\n\n\n"}

He appeared between 1976 and 2006 and in a short special episode for Text Santa in 2012 where he appeared as a ghost sent from Hell to give Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) a warning to change his ways.\n\nMike started his career as a market stall holder but within a few years was running his own factory. In 1976, he opened denim-maker \"Baldwin's Casuals\" in Weatherfield and moved there, ending his relationship with his common-law wife Anne Woodley. As an employer, Mike was uncompromising, quick to threaten his machinists with the sack if they slacked and taking a dim view of workers getting above themselves.\n\nMike's relationship with florist Maggie Dunlop foundered when she became pregnant and she ended things with him when he refused to buy the florist's she worked in. She married Harry Redman shortly before the birth of her son, Mark. The Redmans moved away and Mike did not see Mark for years.\n\nOne major storyline involving Mike came in 1983 when he had an affair with Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride). Before her marriage to Ken Barlow (William Roache), Deirdre had dated Mike, but decided Ken suited her better. When their marriage became jaded, she turned to Mike. After she had confessed everything to Ken, Mike turned up on the doorstep in the hope of taking her away, but she decided to stay with Ken. This event began the long-running feud between Mike and Ken. Mike went on to marry Ken's daughter, Susan Barlow (Wendy Jane Walker; Suzy Patterson), who was many years his junior. This upset Ken further. The marriage failed because Mike and Susan disagreed about their plans for the future. On discovering that Susan was pregnant, Mike wanted her to become a stay-at-home wife and mother but Susan decided to have an abortion, and moved to Newcastle after just a year of marriage.\n\nMike's on/off relationship with Alma Sedgewick (Amanda Barrie) lasted the longest. It seemed to be over when he abandoned Alma to marry wealthy widow Jackie Ingram (Shirin Taylor), who inherited a factory from her late husband, Peter (who had died of a heart attack during an argument with Mike). Jackie soon saw through him and their marriage lasted one week. Jackie threatened Mike with a shotgun if he did not get out of her sight. A couple of years later, after Alma's relationship with Ken failed because of her feelings for Mike, Mike and Alma finally married. Mike once again had his own business, the underwear factory \"Underworld\". In 1998, Mike was seduced by Julia Stone, who blackmailed him for large sums of cash. When Alma discovered this, she left Mike; once they had divorced, she reverted to her maiden name of Halliwell. Unable to win Alma back, Mike settled with loud-mouthed machinist Linda Sykes (Jacqueline Pirie), who was interested only in his money. His long-lost son, Mark Redman (Paul Fox), came to Weatherfield, and Mike took him on at the factory as manager. However, on his wedding night, Mike found out that Mark and Linda had been having an affair. At first, he blamed Mark but he soon enraged Linda by choosing to spend time with Alma, who was dying of cervical cancer. At this point, he realised that marrying Linda was a mistake. Following Alma's death, he ended the marriage and Linda slept with Mike's new business associate in revenge. She also caused a stir at Fred Elliott's (John Savident) wedding to her mother, Eve Sykes (Melanie Kilburn), and the pressure built on Mike as Mark returned for the celebration. Mike was seen arguing with Linda, who mysteriously disappeared. Mike was arrested on suspicion of murder but Linda was found in Ireland with a new man.\n\nIn 2001, Ken revealed that Susan had a son, Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson), fathered by Mike. Susan had been lying when she said she had terminated her pregnancy. As Mike began a fight for access to his son, Susan attempted to escape again but in her haste, she crashed her car on the motorway and was killed. Adam survived the crash and this led to a custody battle between Mike and Ken. Mike was awarded custody, but returned Adam to his boarding school in Scotland, where his friends were.\n\nIn 2004, Mike's nephew Danny (Bradley Walsh), Danny's wife, Frankie (Debra Stephenson), and their sons, Jamie (Rupert Hill) and Warren (Danny Young), came to live in Weatherfield, where Danny helped Mike run the factory. Many long-time viewers did not like the addition of Danny and Frankie to the cast, as their existence had only been made possible by continuity error; Mike had long been portrayed as an only child and, adding confusion, Mike's father was also named Frankie. In late October 2005, it is discovered that Danny is actually Mike's son, a result of a fling between Mike and his sister-in-law, Viv (Patricia Brake).\n\nTowards the end of 2005, Mike was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, aged 63. He soon split from his beautiful girlfriend Penny King (Pauline Fleming), whom he had intended to marry. He once asked Rita Fairclough (Barbara Knox) how her husband Len (Peter Adamson) was - when he had in fact died more than 20 years ago. He also went into The Rovers Return and asked where Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) was, not remembering that she had left the pub 10 years earlier. A further misunderstanding caused him to become estranged from Adam. Danny engineered sole inheritance of Mike's empire, egged on by his girlfriend Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson).\n\nMike's last appearance was in the episode of 7 April 2006. He had been admitted to hospital with pneumonia, but escaped when Jamie left his side for a moment. Making it back to his factory on Coronation Street, he was found by his old rival Ken. Shortly afterwards, he collapsed and died in Ken's arms, after suffering a massive heart attack. He was 64 years old. His passing – like that of Alma in 2001 – was respected with the theme tune not being played over the credits, though a continuity announcement was made. His last words were \"You're finished Barlow, Deirdre loves me, she's mine.\" Over the last few months of his life, he had been confusing the past and present: Alma, his beloved former wife who had died in 2001, was often mentioned, as was Bet – he even broke into Bet's former home in 2006, to be confronted by the current resident, a surprised Les Battersby (Bruce Jones).\n\nIn October 2019, Adam discusses Mike's death with Ken and reveals the irony of Mike dying in Ken's arms.\n\nMaking his first appearance in 1976 as a Cockney businessman with an eye for the ladies, Mike was the son of an occasional character, Frank \"Frankie\" Baldwin, a former docker and Cockney wide boy. He is said to have been introduced following pressure from Thames Television and Southern Television to introduce a character from the South of England, as the series' ratings fell in the mid-1970s especially in those regions. Mike Baldwin became chiefly known for his ruthlessness in business and his string of ruined relationships. During his time on the show, Mike had 25 girlfriends and four wives.\n\nMike's family history was retconned in 2004 when his nephew, Danny, was introduced. Prior to this, Mike was always referred to as an only child.\n\nMike and Alma Sedgewick's (Amanda Barrie) romance stemmed back to 1989 and they wed on-screen in 1992, the marriage lasting seven years. It has been suggested in a 2006 ITV documentary that Mike, an antagonistic womanising character, met his match in Alma. William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow, has stated that of all Mike's many women in the serial, he always felt that Alma was Mike's true love, the one that was right and good for him. Briggs has stated that he always enjoyed watching the scenes between Mike and Alma, because Alma knew how to handle Mike. Barrie has discussed the way she approached playing the romance between Mike and Alma, suggesting that as Alma she treated Mike in the same way that she [Barrie] treated Briggs off-set, poking fun at him.\n\nTelevision researcher Helena Robson has discussed the appeal of soap operas and suggested that \"many soap stories are never finally resolved and conflicts between characters may run throughout the programme's history\". She used the \"undying hatred\" between Mike Baldwin and Ken Barlow (William Roache) as an example of this, suggesting that viewers \"welcome the sense of stability this offers although the element of change offers as much enjoyment for viewers.\" It was suggested in an ITV documentary in 2006 that Ken and Mike's hatred was a clash of cultures: \"Barlow the lefty do-gooder versus Baldwin, the cut-and-thrust money grabber.\" Briggs has claimed that Ken was jealous of Mike because he was rich and successful while Ken was not, and Roache has claimed that the reason Ken disliked Mike was because he was a self-centred and self-made individual.\nKen's feud with Mike—spanning over 20 years—began in 1983, when Ken discovered that his wife, Deirdre, was having an affair with Mike. Of the love triangle storyline, Briggs has said, \"the way it captured the nation was amazing. Everyone was talking about it and the pubs were empty. Men were shouting out: 'Go on Mike, give her one.' People were disappointed when she went back to Ken\". The storyline had significant cultural impact, with the press claiming that the country was divided between those who thought Deirdre should remain with Ken, and those who thought she should leave with Mike. In her 2003 book, Hobson suggested that Ken \"spent at least nineteen years unable to cope with the sense of rejection and betrayal\" caused by Mike's and Deirdre's affair.\n\nScriptwriters capitalised on the rivalry between the characters when, in 1986, Mike married Ken's daughter Susan, a union that Ken strongly opposed. Numerous fights between Ken and Mike were featured, and Briggs has suggested that they became famous for their brawls. The first fight between the pair occurred in 1986, when Ken confronted Mike in his factory about Mike's maltreatment of his daughter. Of the confrontation, Briggs has said, \"It was a classic – Baldwin getting it in his own territory, the factory. It took a lot to get Ken angry but after the way Mike had treated his daughter, he was furious. He marched into the office and let him have it. This was one of those rare times he caught Mike off-guard.\" Mike was shown to get revenge on Ken, though it took a further four years before he could do so on-screen. In a scene which aired in 1990, Mike punched Ken, knocking him over a table in the Rovers Return public house. Briggs has suggested that he and Roache became old hands at doing on-screen fistfights, and that both really enjoyed doing the stunts. According to Briggs, no choreographers were ever used. In 1998 one incident left Briggs with an injury after he fell backwards.\n\nMike and Ken were forced to work together in 2000, when they were featured in a storyline dubbed the \"Freshco siege\". Ken and Mike were among several series regulars held up at gunpoint in the soap's local supermarket, where Ken had been working as a trolley pusher. The episode was broadcast after the 9 pm watershed due to its depiction of violence. Ken and Mike were bound together by armed robbers, which facilitated an end to their feud; Ken helped Mike to combat a panic attack. The pair resolved to put the past behind them; it was a temporary reprieve. Mike had unknowingly fathered a son, Adam, during his brief marriage to Susan Barlow; she kept the baby a secret from him. Mike discovered Adam's existence in 2001; Susan attempted to flee, but was killed in a motor accident. Then followed a battle between Mike and Ken for custody of Adam, with Ken adamant that Mike should not look after his grandson.\n\nThe feud came to an end on-screen in 2006, when Briggs quit the role of Mike. Mike was killed-off, dying of Alzheimer's disease; he died in Ken's arms. In the final scenes, a disoriented and dying Mike was found wandering the streets by Ken, and as Ken cradled Mike in his arms, the rivals talked about old times before Mike died, signifying the end of their 20-year feud. To promote Mike's final scenes, \"Radio Times\" released a series of photographs with Ken and Mike re-enacting Arthur Devis's (1807) painting of the death of Horatio Nelson—Baldwin was shown surrounded by his nearest and dearest during his final moments, with Ken prominently positioned next to him, taking on the role of Captain Hardy, Nelson's trusted colleague to whom Nelson famously uttered \"Kiss me\" before he died. Producer Maire Tracey said, \"The fact that Mike dies in Ken's arms says it all. For most of Mike's life, it was his battles with Ken that kept him going. Like two cowboys, they spent their lives sizing each other up. Behind the scenes Bill Roache has even suggested to Johnny Briggs that they should make a version of \"Brokeback Mountain\" for the two elderly cowboys. Both Ken and Mike will miss the bust-ups.\"\n\nJournalist Johann Hari, writing for \"The Independent\" heaped praise upon Mike's dementia storyline: \"You can see some of these qualities in the storyline that has just stuttered to a close, the tale of the cracking and breaking of wide-boy Street stalwart Mike Baldwin into dementia and death. A soap can do Alzheimer's perfectly because it can draw on the collected memories of it audience in a way no other art form, except perhaps the epic novel, can. When Mike loses it and starts crying for Alma – the ex-wife who died years ago – we remember her too. When we see him breaking from his dementia-fever for a moment and asking his old flame Deirdre to dance – an almost unimaginably sad scene, as he beams in mid-dance and says: 'This is lovely', while she quietly weeps over his shoulder – the performances are layered with literally decades of shared experience.\"\n\nGrace Dent, writing for \"The Guardian\" heaped similar praise on the storyline as she paid tribute to the legendary character: \"So, farewell Mike Baldwin. Laid on the cobbles in front of the Kabin, this week Mike took his last breaths, clutched to the breast of his nemesis Ken Barlow, witnessed by Rita and Emily, both neighbours of 30 years. A peculiarly fitting end to the cockney king of knickers. He'll be sadly missed. No more Mike Baldwin in his Edinburgh Woollen Mill golfing jerseys and smart-casual slacks sneaking a fine single malt and a lamb hotpot. No more clashes with Fizz over shoddy stitching or scanning the obituaries for wealthy widows to woo. No more boozy afternoons at the 19th hole. Literally the end of an era. Although Mike's decline from Alzheimer's was bleak and harrowing, there were bittersweet moments to his final days. Imaginary meetings with Bet Lynch, Alma Halliwell and his mother. Chess with Chesney and a day out in town with old flame Deirdre. The time, at last, to watch Ready Steady Cook and wear pyjamas until tea-time.\"\n"}

A total of 108 of these ships were built between 1943 and 1945—which worked out to an average of one ship every eight days. Six additional AKAs, featuring new and improved designs, were built in later years. They were originally called Attack Cargo Ships and designated AKA. In 1969, they were renamed as Amphibious Cargo Ships and redesignated LKA. \n\nCompared to other cargo ship types, these ships could carry landing craft, were faster, had more armament, and had larger hatches and booms. Their holds were optimized for combat loading, a method of cargo storage where the items first needed ashore were at the top of the hold, and those needed later were lower down. Because these ships went into forward combat areas, they had Combat Information Centers and significant amounts of equipment for radio communication, neither of which were present in other cargo ships.\n\nAs amphibious operations became more important in World War II, planners saw the need for a special kind of cargo ship, one that could carry both cargo and the LCM and LCVP boats with which to attack the beach, and that carried guns to assist in anti-air defense and shore bombardment. Specifications were drawn up, and beginning in early 1943, the first 16 U.S. attack cargo ships were converted from Navy cargo ships that had previously been designated AK. During the course of the war, 108 such ships were built; many of them were converted from non-military ships, or started out as non-military hulls.\n\nAttack cargo ships played a vital role in the Pacific War, where many were attacked by kamikazes and other aircraft, and several were torpedoed, but none were sunk or otherwise destroyed. Nine AKAs were present at the surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.\n\nAfter the war, many AKAs were put into the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Others were converted for other uses, such as oceanographic surveying, undersea cable laying, and repairing other ships.\n\nSome of the reserve ships were recommissioned for service in the Korean War, and some stayed in service during the Vietnam War. \n\nSix more amphibious cargo ships, somewhat larger and of improved design, were built between 1954 and 1969.\n\nIn 1969, the U.S. Navy redesignated all its AKA \"attack\" cargo ships as LKA \"amphibious\" cargo ships. At the same time, the other \"A\" designations of amphibious ships were changed to similar \"L\" designations. For example, all the APAs were redesignated as LPAs.\n\nIn the 1960s, both the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy developed amphibious transport docks which gradually took on this unique amphibious role and today have assumed it completely. The last amphibious cargo ship in the U. S. Navy, USS \"El Paso\" (LKA-117), was decommissioned in April, 1994.\n\n\n\n"}

Her father, Allan Block, ran a sandal shop in Greenwich Village in the 1960s, and the Greenwich Village folk music scene, such as Peter Rowan, Maria Muldaur, and John Sebastian influenced Block to study classical guitar. At the age of 14, she met guitarist Stefan Grossman, who introduced her to the music of Mississippi Delta blues guitarists.\n\nBlock began listening to old albums, transcribing them, and learning to play the songs. At age 15, she left home to seek out the remaining blues giants, such as Mississippi John Hurt, Reverend Gary Davis, and Son House, and hone her craft in the traditional manner of blues musicians; then she traveled to Berkeley, California, where she played in clubs and coffeehouses.\n\nAfter retiring temporarily to raise a family, Block returned to the music industry in the 1970s with middling success until signing with Rounder Records in 1981, who encouraged her to return to her love for the classical blues form. Since then she has carved out her own niche, releasing numerous critically acclaimed albums of original and traditional songs, including many Robert Johnson covers, such as \"Terraplane Blues\" and \"Come on in My Kitchen\".\n\n\"Angel of Mercy,\" \"Turning Point,\" and \"Tornado\" included mostly original compositions.

The original recording of the song was considered too long for release on a 45 rpm single, so it was split into two parts. It was this first part, \"Peppermint Twist (Part 1)\", with a length of 2:03, which became the #1 hit; the mostly instrumental second half of the recording is rarely heard today.\n\n\"Peppermint Twist\" replaced Chubby Checker's \"The Twist,\" the song that sparked the Twist fad, at the #1 position. A version by Bill Haley & His Comets was recorded for Armed Forces Radio in 1962, but was not released until 2000.\n\nThe lead singer in the Starliters' version is David Brigati, whose brother, Eddie Brigati, was a singer for the 1960s hit pop group, the (Young) Rascals.

{"id": "2275350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275350", "title": "WGBO-DT", "text": "WGBO-DT\n\nWGBO-DT, virtual channel 66 (UHF digital channel 35), is a Univision owned-and-operated television station serving Chicago, Illinois, United States that is licensed to Joliet. The station is owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications, as part of a duopoly with Aurora-licensed UniMás owned-and-operated station WXFT-DT (channel 60). The two stations share studios on Fairbanks Court (near Columbus Drive and Illinois Street); WGBO's transmitter is located atop the John Hancock Center on North Michigan Avenue, both in the Streeterville neighborhood.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on September 18, 1981 as independent station WFBN. Originally owned by Nashville-based Focus Broadcasting, it initially ran local public-access programs during the daytime hours and the subscription television service Spectrum during the nighttime. By 1982, WFBN ran Spectrum programming almost 24 hours a day; however, by the fall of 1983, Spectrum shared the same schedule with that service's Chicago subscription rival ONTV. The station as well as ONTV parent National Subscription Television faced legal scrutiny because of its lack of news or public affairs programming and was faced with class action lawsuits because of the pornographic films aired by ONTV during late-night timeslots, with some of these legal challenges continuing even after ONTV was discontinued; however, a ruling by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permitted broadcast television stations to air content normally considered indecent through an amendment to its definition of what constituted \"public airwaves\" declaring that \"broadcasts which could not be seen and heard in the clear by an ordinary viewer with an ordinary television\" were exempt, as long as the signal was encrypted.\n\nWFBN continued the subscription programming format until early 1984, when it dropped Spectrum and adopted a 24-hour music video format. The music video format was discontinued by the fall of 1984, at which time WFBN transitioned into a general entertainment programming format, filling its schedule with movies from the 1930s through the 1980s, off-network classic sitcoms, and drama series—most of which were dropped by rival independents WGN-TV (channel 9, formerly a CW affiliate, now once again an independent station) and WFLD (channel 32, now a Fox owned-and-operated station) in previous years.\n\nThe station was losing money by this point, leading Focus Broadcasting to put channel 66 up for sale in summer 1985. Focus sold a 50% interest in the station to the Grant Broadcasting System in September 1985 for $2 million and an estimated $50 million in debt (some of which was forgiven or refinanced), with an option to acquire the remaining 50% interest by 1990 for $25 million at minimum, should it be exercised in the first year of the option and at minimum of $40 million if exercised in the fifth year of the option. Creditors to which the station owed debt allowed WFBN to remain in operation following its claim that the station was \"on the verge of involuntary bankruptcy\" with the possibility of ceasing operations by October 1 at the earliest; the reprieve was pending Focus' request to the FCC to expedite the transfer of the station's license to Grant. Metrowest Corporation—then-owners of WPWR-TV (channel 60, now a MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station on channel 50)—filed a petition to deny the sale, claiming that even before it acquired the WFBN license, Grant attempted to \"stifle competition in the Chicago television market with multimarket program purchases, exclusive arrangements and similar deals\".\n\nThe station changed its call letters to WGBO-TV on January 4, 1986, adopting \"Super 66\" as its on-air branding (the WFBN call letters are now used by a low-power television station in Rockford owned by Weigel Broadcasting, the owner of WCIU, which currently relays Telemundo programming from Milwaukee sister station WYTU-LD; the station previously aired \"WebFN\", the successor to \"Stock Market Observer\", whose refusal by WCIU to remove resulted in Univision purchasing WGBO in 1994).\n\nAlthough not dramatically different overall, in January 1986, WGBO added a few more off-network sitcoms, a limited number of children's programs, and several western series to its schedule. In addition, it carried daily simulcasts of CNN Headline News, as well as Loyola Ramblers college basketball games. The station also adopted a very slick on-air look, using CGI graphics of near-network quality. This design was very similar to those adopted by sister stations WGBS-TV (now WPSG) in Philadelphia and WBFS-TV in Miami. However, WGBO was run somewhat more frugally than its two sisters and never really thrived in the ratings, despite Grant's ambitions of turning his three stations into regional superstations.\n\nAs WGBO tried to acquire more barter programming and cheap low-budget shows, it found that any available inventory was picked clean by established independents WGN-TV, WFLD and WPWR-TV. WGBO made virtually no headway against the established independents and was not able to compete against WPWR (even with all of the low-budget shows WPWR had on its schedule, along with many barter shows). There simply was not enough moderate-rated syndicated programming to go around, even in a market as large as Chicago. Grant was so badly overextended that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 8, 1986, in an attempt to protect itself from its creditors. While the other two stations retained similar formats with fewer shows, WGBO added a large number of infomercials, religious programs and other paid programs to its schedule, although it did hold on to some entertainment-based programs. Ratings remained dismal as they had been beforehand.\n\nIn a March 1987 Philadelphia Bankruptcy Court proceeding, Grant was allowed to continue operating its stations until at least July 1 through cash and accounts receivables to fund operations, denying a motion by the company's creditors to assume control of the stations or force their sale. However, on July 7, Grant agreed to enter into receivership, and turn over control of the company and its three stations to its television program suppliers and bondholders under a reorganization plan—which was formally filed on October 13 and approved on March 30, 1988—to repay $420 million in debt from the stations' operations by 1995, at which point the stations would be sold off. In July 1988, Combined Broadcasting, a creditor-controlled company, took over Grant and the three stations. In the early 1990s, WGBO added some barter cartoons and sitcoms that other stations passed on or previously dropped from their schedules.\n\nAfter Time Warner announced the launch of The WB on November 2, 1993, the network had entered into discussions with WGBO to become the network's Chicago affiliate; even though Tribune Broadcasting would hold a partial ownership interest in The WB and tapped its independent stations in other markets to serve as the network's charter affiliates, WGN-TV—the company's flagship television station—originally passed on affiliating with The WB due to management concerns that a network affiliation would hamper its ability to balance its sports broadcast commitments. WGN-TV reversed course on December 3, in a deal that also resulted in its superstation feed (now known as WGN America) carrying the network nationally, keeping WGBO a true independent station. The United Paramount Network (UPN) then planned to affiliate with WGBO, as the network had also reached agreements to affiliate with sister stations WGBS and WBFS in advance of its launch.\n\nIn 1993, Univision asked WCIU-TV (channel 26) to remove the English-language programming it aired on its schedule, and become a full-time affiliate of the network, a request that WCIU owner Weigel Broadcasting opted not to consider; WCIU had been affiliated with Univision for many years, but continued to air the \"Stock Market Observer\", an English-language business news programming block before 5:00 p.m. each weekday as well as a select number of English language entertainment programs. Univision then entered into negotiations to purchase WGBO-TV.\n\nOn January 10, 1994, Univision announced that it would purchase WGBO—including most non-license assets such as its studio facilities, transmission equipment and transmitter, but excluding its existing programming inventory—from Combined for $35 million, with the intent of moving the network's programming there; the purchase was finalized on May 13. In August 1994, Combined Broadcasting subsequently announced that it would sell WGBS and WBFS-TV to the Paramount Stations Group (which concurrently sold its original Philadelphia station, Fox affiliate WTXF-TV, to Fox Television Stations) in a group deal for $165 million. With WGBO having already been sold to Univision, the station was not part of this deal, a situation that was moot as UPN chose to instead affiliate with WPWR-TV in December 1993. In some ways, the Paramount Stations Group already owned the three stations, as its owner Viacom was a non-voting partner in Combined Broadcasting.\n\nIn August 1994, Univision officially assumed ownership of Channel 66. However, Univision was still in the midst of an affiliation agreement with WCIU, which did not expire until December 31, 1994; as a result, Univision was forced to run WGBO as an English language independent station for five months until that station's affiliation contract with the network expired. On January 1, 1995, WGBO formally switched to Spanish language programming when it became a Univision owned-and-operated station – giving the network a full-time presence in the market for the first time since 1989, when the network disaffiliated from WSNS-TV to return to WCIU. Most of WGBO's entertainment programming inventory was sold to WCIU. That same year, Oshkosh, Wisconsin radio station WVBO asked WGBO for permission to use the call letters WGBO-FM for its planned simulcast feed in Green Bay (to stand for \"Green Bay Oldies\"). WGBO refused permission for the use of the calls, and the Green Bay station went on the air under the callsign WOGB instead.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nIn December 2009, WGBO and sister station WXFT, along with most of Univision's other owned-and-operated stations, upgraded their main digital channels to transmit in 1080i high definition, in preparation for the launches of Univision and Telefutura's HD simulcast feeds in 2010.\n\nWGBO-DT is one of only two full-power television stations in the Chicago market (the other being PBS member station WYCC, channel 20) which maintain transmitter facilities atop the John Hancock Center. Most of the market's other television stations operate their transmitters atop the Willis Tower, although WPVN-CD (channel 24) transmits its signal from the Trump International Hotel and Tower. On September 24, 2012, WGBO filed an application to move its transmitter to the Willis Tower at 650 kW; the FCC granted the construction permit to build the Willis Tower transmitter on October 23.\n\nWGBO shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 66, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station moved its digital signal from its pre-transition UHF channel 53 to UHF channel 38 (which was formerly used by the analog signal and presently by the virtual digital channel of Ion Television owned-and-operated station WCPX-TV) for post-transition operations. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 66, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nOn June 13, 2009, WGBO altered its legal call sign, replacing the \"-TV\" suffix with a \"-DT\" suffix in order to conform to Univision Communications' practices to adopt the \"-DT\" suffix for the calls of its full-power television stations.\n\nWGBO-DT presently broadcasts seventeen hours of locally-produced newscasts weekly, consisting of two half-hour newscasts at 5 and at 10 p.m., and a two-hour morning show.\n\nUpon affiliating with Univision in January 1995, WGBO launched a news department and began producing local Spanish language newscasts at 5:00 and 10:00 p.m. – with the early-evening broadcast originally anchored by Elio Montenegro (formerly of CLTV) and Edna Schmidt, and Jorge Barbosa serving as anchor of the 10:00 p.m. newscast. On January 4, 2012, WGBO began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.\n\nOn January 21, 2019, the station premiered a two-hour local morning newscast on weekdays, \"Primera Hora\", leading into the national morning show \"¡Despierta América!\". Univision billed the program as being Chicago's first local, Spanish-language morning newscast.\n\n\n"}

During his NHL career, Roloson played for the Calgary Flames, Buffalo Sabres, Minnesota Wild, Edmonton Oilers, New York Islanders and Tampa Bay Lightning. He is often affectionately referred to by his fans as \"Roli\". Following Mark Recchi's retirement in 2011, Roloson became the oldest active NHL player at the time and the last active NHL player to have been born in the 1960s.\n\nRoloson was born on October 12, 1969 in Simcoe, Ontario. He graduated from the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\n\nA Hobey Baker Award nominee and National Collegiate Athletic Association All-American while tending goal for University of Massachusetts Lowell, Roloson went undrafted after graduating. He was signed as a free agent by the NHL's Calgary Flames in 1994. After splitting time between the Flames and their American Hockey League (AHL) counterpart, the Saint John Flames, he was traded to the Buffalo Sabres to back up Dominik Hašek. Following two years with the Sabres, he was picked up in the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Rather than joining the Blue Jackets, Roloson signed with the AHL team of the St. Louis Blues, the Worcester IceCats.\n\nRoloson earned a roster spot with the Minnesota Wild in 2001. In the 2002–03 season, Roloson shared goaltending duties with Manny Fernandez as the Wild made their first ever appearance in the Stanley Cup playoffs, reaching the Western Conference Final. Despite splitting goaltending duties with Fernandez, Roloson earned his first All-Star appearance at age 34, appearing in the 2004 NHL All-Star Game with the Western Conference team. He also won the Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award for having the NHL's best save percentage. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Roloson played for Lukko of the Finnish SM-liiga.\n\nOn March 8, 2006, Roloson was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for the first round pick that later became part of a trade for Pavol Demitra and a conditional draft pick that later became a third-rounder. Initially, Oilers general manager Kevin Lowe was harshly criticized for the acquisition when Roloson struggled during the regular season. Lowe was criticized both for not acquiring a better goaltender, and also for surrendering a first-round draft pick to a divisional rival.\n\nCriticism was muted following sensational play by Roloson, backstopping the Oilers to the final of the 2006 playoffs. He had a record of 12–5 through the first three rounds, and along with Chris Pronger, was considered a front-runner for the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP if the Oilers were victorious in the finals.\n\nHowever, during Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Carolina Hurricanes, Roloson suffered a third-degree MCL sprain of his right knee when Hurricanes forward Andrew Ladd was pushed into Roloson by a back-checking Oiler defenseman Marc-André Bergeron. Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish announced Roloson would not be able to continue in the series. It was also learned he had hyper-extended his right elbow in the collision as well. Back-up goaltender Ty Conklin replaced Roloson for the remainder of Game 1 and co-backup goalie Jussi Markkanen finished the series. The Oilers lost to the Hurricanes in seven games. Months of intense rehabilitation would follow in order to prepare Roloson for the 2006–07 season.\n\nRoloson could have tested the unrestricted free agency market in the summer of 2006 but opted to re-sign with the Oilers on July 1, 2006, on a three-year contract.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, Roloson started out strong before seeing his record fall to 7–12–0. By early January 2008, backup goaltender Mathieu Garon had taken the reins as starter. It was not until March 13, 2008, that Roloson saw regular play, coming in as relief for an injured Garon, starting each subsequent game.\n\nWhen the 2008–09 season began, Roloson found himself vying for the starting goaltender position with Garon and upstart Jeff Deslauriers. For the beginning of the season, it appeared Garon was once again the starter but after some bad games Oiler head coach Craig MacTavish decided to rotate Garon, Deslauriers and Roloson by playing whoever had the hot hand. Eventually, the team traded Garon to the Pittsburgh Penguins and Roloson claimed the starting spot. Down the stretch, he started 36 consecutive games as the Oilers fought for a playoff spot. During this time, he became the oldest goaltender to start more than 60 games in a single season. Though the Oilers ultimately did not qualify for the playoffs, Roloson put up solid numbers, making upwards of 40 saves on a regular basis.\n\nOn July 1, 2009, Roloson became an unrestricted free agent. After rejecting a one-year, $3 million offer from Edmonton, Roloson signed a two-year, $5 million contract with the New York Islanders. The Islanders also signed Martin Biron, who was to serve as Roloson's backup goaltender while Rick DiPietro was out on injured reserve. Roloson lost his first game as an Islander on October 3, 2009, in a shootout.\n\nOn November 23, 2009, Roloson made 58 saves on 61 shots in a 4–3 overtime win over the Toronto Maple Leafs. The 58 saves were a career high, and broke the Islander club record of 56, held by Rick DiPietro.\n\nOn January 1, 2011, Roloson was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for defenceman Ty Wishart. He won his first game with Tampa Bay in a 1–0 overtime shutout against the Washington Capitals. In his first 11 games with the Lightning, he recorded four shutouts. In April 2011, Roloson recorded a shutout in a first round playoff Game 7 against the Pittsburgh Penguins, making him the oldest goaltender to do so. Roloson and the Lightning ultimately advanced to the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, where they were eliminated by the Boston Bruins in seven games. With his contract set to expire, the Lightning signed Roloson to a one-year, $3 million contract extension on June 29, 2011. He retired at season's end after the Lightning failed to qualify for the 2012 playoffs.\n\nRoloson was a member of the Canadian 2007 IIHF World Championship team that won gold in a 4–2 win against Finland in Moscow.\n\nIn 2009, Roloson (along with Oilers teammate Shawn Horcoff) was called upon for Canada at the 2009 IIHF World Championship. He played in the finals against Russia, which Canada lost 2–1.\n\nFollowing his retirement from ice hockey, Roloson was immediately hired as a consultant to the Anaheim Ducks' AHL affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals. On June 10, 2013, Roloson was named as the replacement for Pete Peeters as the Anaheim Ducks' goaltending consultant. On November 2, 2014, he suited-up in an emergency role after Ducks goaltender John Gibson suffered a pre-game injury and could not play the game against the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nRoloson and his wife Melissa, who were married in 1999, have two sons. He is close friends with Rob Blake, with whom he played minor hockey in Simcoe, Ontario. He is also friends with Andrew Brunette.\n\nThe Saint Paul Police Federation swore in Dwayne Roloson as an honorary police officer for his interest and involvement with local law enforcement. He teaches his goalie school with Minnesota Wild goaltending coach Bob Mason.\n\nWhile with the Tampa Bay Lightning, Roloson wore a mask that had a shamrock with the initials \"KR\" to remember Kelly Ryan, a 12-year-old player who attended several of Roloson's goalie camps. The shamrock also had the letters \"TDLO\", \"The Dream Lives On\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2275366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275366", "title": "Audrey Roberts", "text": "Audrey Roberts\n\nAudrey Roberts (also Potter) is a fictional character from the ITV soap opera, \"Coronation Street\", played by Sue Nicholls. Audrey made her first appearance on 16 April 1979 and appeared on a recurring basis for three years until April 1982. She returned over two years later in July 1984, before becoming a full-time regular character from 1985.\n\nAudrey Potter makes her first appearance at daughter Gail Potter's (Helen Worth) engagement party to Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten). As an unmarried mother, Audrey is not considered a suitable match for widowed local councillor, Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley). With Alf, she gains respectability and a stable life as she has not shown much interest in her daughter. She marries Alf on 23 December 1985, later enjoying the social status of mayoress and believing herself to be better than the other residents. Audrey attempts to revive her career as a hairdresser and persuades Alf to buy the salon from Fiona Middleton (Angela Griffin).\n\nOver the years, Audrey mellows from a social climber to a more sympathetic character. The existence of another child, Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce), in Canada, is revealed some years later. She is heartbroken by Alf's sudden death in 1999 but throws herself into work and stands for council herself, retaining her seat until 2001. Audrey is similarly devastated when her best friend, Alma Halliwell (Amanda Barrie), dies of cervical cancer in June 2001.\n\nAudrey nearly becomes a victim of her serial killer son-in-law, Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), when he discovers that she is inherited quite a lot of money from Alf. In late 2002, viewers saw him subtly make Audrey fear that she is developing senile dementia by deliberately unlocking doors she had locked, hanging out washing that she does not remember, turning on lights and dropping a dress off to be dry-cleaned. Finally, he tries to kill her in a house fire, made to look like the result of her dementia, with the battery removed from the fire alarm. However, Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) rescues her. After Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw), is murdered in January 2003, Audrey suspects Richard is responsible and urges Gail to leave him, fearing for her and the children, Sarah (Tina O'Brien) and David's (Jack P. Shepherd), safety but Gail will not listen. Audrey challenges Richard at Maxine's funeral, accusing him of her murder, much to the mourners' indignation but Ken Barlow (William Roache) believes her, suspecting that chief suspect Aiden Critchley (Dean Ashton) is innocent. Archie and Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) are also suspicious of Richard's dealings with his elderly clients. In March 2003, Gail learns the truth and Richard tries to kill himself, Gail and her children by driving them into the canal. Gail and her children are rescued but Richard drowns. Afterwards, Audrey and Gail reconcile.\n\nIn October 2006, Audrey speaks to her close friend, Fred Elliott (John Savident), just as he is due to marry Bev Unwin (Susie Blake) and tells him that she wishes they were getting married. This upsets Fred and makes him doubt if he should marry Bev but he decides to go ahead. Audrey tells Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) that she will not be at the wedding so Fred borrows Bev's car to visit her. After a heart-to-heart, Fred collapses in the hall and dies. Audrey, accompanied by the police, tells Ashley and his wife, Claire (Julia Haworth). Later that year, Audrey makes friends with Bill Webster (Peter Armitage). However, on Christmas Day 2006, Bill's wife Maureen (Sherrie Hewson) arrives and learns that Bill has been having an affair with Audrey. Bill and Maureen return to Germany but he leaves Maureen and moves in with Audrey, deciding to try to make a go of their relationship. David also moves in after Gail kicks him out. Stephen visits and offers David a job in Italy but changes his mind after Audrey finds drugs in his drawer at the salon. Sarah, her daughter Bethany (Amy & Emily Walton) and Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) go instead but after learning Sarah planted the drugs, Jason refuses to go so Sarah and Bethany go alone. Eventually, Audrey becomes annoyed with David, especially after discovering he pushed Gail down the stairs during an argument and is stunned when Gail will not press charges, and still has a reticent relationship with David.\n\nIn 2008, Audrey is contacted by Ted Page (Michael Byrne), Gail's father. He does not know about their daughter, so Audrey meets him and tells him that he has a family. He is surprised, but has a surprise of his own - he is gay. In August, Audrey returns from a booze cruise in France with Bill, Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) and Roger Stiles (Andrew Dunn). Audrey did not enjoy the trip, feeling that Bill ignored her. Bill has been drinking so Audrey drives. While driving, Audrey and Janice begin arguing and Janice accuses her of being a fortune hunter and not caring about Alf or Fred. Audrey is furious, even more so when Bill does not defend her. The argument causes Audrey to crash the car and she injures her arm. Disgusted with Bill, she ends their relationship and asks him to move out.\n\nAudrey bumps into an old friend, Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska), at a function and is introduced to her dinner partner, Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers). Claudia later tells Audrey that Lewis is an escort and she should give him a call. Audrey, having become smitten with Lewis, contacts him and begins seeing him occasionally. In April 2010, Audrey is not pleased to see Lewis out with Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox), which leads to the two women having a bitter argument over Lewis. Later that month, Audrey discovers Lewis's black book with details on all his clients. She is deeply hurt to see that she is no more than a paying customer to him, but when he assures her that he has fallen for her too, she responds to his kiss and they become a couple. Approaching her 70th birthday, Audrey toys with the idea of retirement, as she wants to settle down with Lewis. At her birthday party in The Rovers, she argues with Gail, when she discovers that Lewis was an escort. Annoyed with Gail, Rita and Claudia's interference, Audrey announces that she has found happiness with Lewis. Audrey then decides to purchase a Greek hotel with Lewis and emigrate, much to the amazement of her family and friends. However, it soon emerges that Lewis is a conman after he steals £4,000 from the bookies. On the day of their departure, Lewis' deception is revealed after he is caught kissing Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) and placing fake betting slips in the cash register on CCTV. Lewis flees the country with the money, leaving Audrey humiliated and heartbroken. Audrey is shocked to discover that Claudia's boyfriend, Marc Selby (Andrew Hall), is a transvestite when she picks him up from a police station after he is assaulted. Marc begs her not to tell Claudia and Audrey agrees. However, Claudia mistakingly believes that Audrey and Marc are having an affair which leads to Marc telling Claudia about his transvestism.\n\nAt a doctor's appointment, Audrey learns that she and Gail have high blood pressure, caused by too much alcohol. Audrey sets Gail a challenge: to stop drinking and see who can last without it longest, and the pair resolve to get more exercise. Whilst power-walking in the countryside, they are horrified to bump into Lewis in a country pub. He runs away when he sees them and they report Lewis to the police. Lewis later goes to Audrey's salon and tells her he did not mean to hurt her. He asks Audrey to drive him to the police station to prove how sorry he is. In a bid to win her over, Lewis sends her flowers and Audrey goes to his address and finds he is living in a bedsit. Gail disapproves when Audrey's grandson, Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), gives Lewis a job as a waiter but Audrey defends Lewis and he later buys her a bracelet as a thank you. Audrey visits Lewis and asks him to stay, while professing her love for him. They spend the night together and agree to keep their relationship secret but when Audrey fakes illness so she can spend the day with Lewis, David, and Gail visit to check she's okay and see Lewis there. Audrey insists that it is her life and throws them out but Gail insists that Audrey does not leave Lewis, then she does not want to speak to her ever again. Deciding to go on around the world on a cruise with Lewis, Audrey attempts to regain full control of the salon from David. David and his wife, Kylie Platt (Paula Lane), are reluctant to agree to this as they believe Lewis to secretly conning Audrey again and David does not want to lose his inheritance. During a heated argument, Audrey collapses and suffers a heart attack, brought on by stress. She spends several days in hospital but is released and told to take things easy, which she does. When David tries to speak to her, she ignores him and he gets the message relatively quickly, though she does eventually forgive him.\n\nAudrey discovers that Gail and Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) are testing Lewis about whether he really is a changed man. The plan is that Gloria will pretend to be dying and offer a Lewis large amount of money in her will if he leaves Audrey for her. Audrey is shocked and angry but goes along with the plan anyway since even she doubts Lewis slightly. Lewis passes the test and Audrey is smugly delighted. However, when Lewis discovers the truth and confronts Gail, it's clear to Lewis that Audrey knew about the plot, leaving Lewis heartbroken at Audrey's betrayal. Lewis leaves Audrey horrified when he reveals that he was planning to propose to her and he walks out. She calms down when she is reassured by Gail and the family that Lewis would forgive her, especially after being forgiven for his own previous deeds. Audrey is panicky when she returns home and sees that Lewis has packed his things and left. Audrey desperately tries to explain to Lewis but he cannot forgive her and he dumps her. The next day, Audrey furiously tells Gail and Gloria that their meddling has resulted in her losing Lewis. Over the next few months, Lewis plans his revenge. Though Gloria and Gail feel the wrath of Lewis' vengeance, Audrey does not as he still loves her. However, Gail is conned by Lewis when he dupes her into thinking that he loves her after she develops feelings for him. He manages to hack her bank account and then tells her and the rest of her family, in a video message, that he has conned her and fled the country, before telling Audrey that none of this was meant to hurt her and that he still loves her.\n\nThe character of Audrey Potter was created as the mother of established character Gail Potter (Helen Worth). After appearing as an occasional character for several years, she became a permanent member of the core cast in 1985. Actress Sue Nicholls auditioned for the part of Audrey Potter and went on to secure to the role. At the time the actress had been in many theatre, cabaret and TV roles and was continuing with her career whilst appearing in the show on a recurring basis until she was offered the chance to become a permanent cast member. Audrey made her first appearance in the episode broadcast on 16 April 1979.\n\nIn 2010, Nicholls said she can't believe that she's been with \"Coronation Street\" for over 30 years. She commented \"It's the best job to have, especially in this day and age when there are no jobs anyway. Everybody wants to be in it so it must have something going for it! I've been so lucky and if I think back over the years all the people have been lovely and the stories have been hot. Being with Amanda Barrie was lovely, and of course Bryan Mosley who sadly died - and it's thanks to Bryan or whoever - if they hadn't married Audrey off to Alf, who knows I might just have been another tart with a heart passing through.\"\n\nOf her character Nicholls said in 1991 during an interview with Graeme Kay that: \"Audrey's not quite as loud and brazen now, I've tried to take her down a bit, which fitted in with the fact that she married Alf, who is quite serious and sombre. Likewise she's brought him up a bit. Some people see in my character things that I don't. I'm stopped all the time by people who say, \"Isn't she awful to Alf?\" or \"Isn't she a cow\".\n\nIn October 2009, actor Nigel Havers joined the cast of \"Coronation Street\" as a potential love interest for Audrey. Audrey first meets Havers' character, Lewis Archer when she attends a ball with Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden). Audrey is immediately attracted to Lewis, but is frustrated because she is accompanying Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska). Claudia later reveals to Audrey that Lewis is a male escort that charges women for his company. Havers warned that his role of Lewis has a \"dark side\". Havers commented: \"I couldn't resist the idea of doing Coronation Street. I loved the idea of being Audrey's new man. I'm a huge Corrie fan. I started in Corrie a month ago and I'm there until July. I gather my character has a real dark side but I don't know what it is yet.\"\n\nLewis and Audrey decide to rekindle their relationship in March 2012. Kate White from \"Inside Soap\" wrote that Audrey finds Lewis hard to resist, especially after he has apologised for his previous actions. When Lewis is wrongly accused of taking some money from The Bistro, he plans to leave Weatherfield. Nicholls told White that Audrey feels awful that she too accused Lewis and it is a wake up call for her as she does trust him. The actress said Audrey still fancies Lewis and does not want to lose him again. Lewis and Audrey spend the night together and decide to keep their relationship a secret, especially from Audrey's family, as his \"past indiscretions still loom over them like a dark cloud\". Nicholls said Audrey could be making a mistake, and added, \"You read this sort of thing in the papers all the time, women of a certain age being charmed by these men. I'd ask her to think about what she's doing.\" A writer for \"Inside Soap\" said that Audrey and Lewis are very happy as they \"bask in the warmth of their revived romance.\" However, they have to resort to sneaky measures to spend time together to avoid upsetting Audrey's family. When Audrey calls in sick at the salon to spend time with Lewis, Gail and David become concerned and check up on her. They see Lewis leaving her house and realise the pair are back together.\n\nLewis and Audrey decide to go on holiday together and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans to go on a round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is tied up in the salon, so she asks David to sign it back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.\n\nIn 2010, when Gail's husband Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale) is found dead, the police suspect that Gail killed him. Nicholls said that Audrey thinks Gail is innocent. She said that Audrey doesn't believe in any way that she killed him but what she does feel is that the whole story has not come out. The death happened in some way that Gail knows about. \nNicholls said she works very well with Jack P. Shepherd who plays Audrey's grandson David Platt. She commented: \"I do love him - he's a splendid actor and I do love having scenes with him. I hope he does with me. We do laugh a lot despite everything. I'm always saying, 'Oh, David!' a bit like Posh Spice! I like the relationship we have. I have met people who have a better relationship with grandparents, in a funny way. I know that sounds a bit strange but sometimes people who are difficult have more of a contact with another generation. David and Gail have never really connected until now.\" It was announced in April 2012 that Audrey is to suffer a heart attack after weeks of stress trying to get her salon back. Nicholls and writers have worked closely with the British Heart Foundation to help portray the scenes as realistically as possible. Nicholls has also met and spoken to other people who have had heart attacks to extend her research. Nicholls commented \"It was important for me to do this right and the British Heart Foundation have been a huge help to me. They kindly put me in touch with some ladies who had suffered similar attacks to Audrey, and it was really useful to be able to speak to them about their experiences.\"\n\nSue Nicholls won the award for \"Best Comedy Performance\" at the 2000 British Soap Awards. At the 2003 British Soap Awards, Sue Nicholls won gongs for \"Best Dramatic Performance\" and \"Hero of the Year\" for her role in the highly successful Richard Hillman storyline which ran between 2002 and 2003.\n\nIn 2019, Sue Nicholls won the “Outstanding Achievement Award” at the British Soap Awards.\n\nImpressionist Francine Lewis performed an impression of Audrey Roberts in the seventh series of \"Britain's Got Talent\".\n\nIn recent years, some attention has been focused on the 'Audrey Roberts noise' following a viral video created by Martyn Hett, which compiled numerous times Audrey was seen to complete a sentence with an audible 'Hmm?'. The noise was then dubbed onto the song I Don't Like It, I Love It by Flo Rida and Robin Thicke and played on Radio 1 numerous times by Nick Grimshaw.\n\n"}
{"id": "2275368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275368", "title": "Automatic train stop", "text": "Automatic train stop\n\nAutomatic train stop or ATS is a system on a train that automatically stops a train if certain situations occur (unresponsive train operator, earthquake, disconnected rail, train running over a stop signal, etc.) to prevent accidents. In some scenarios it functions as a type of dead man's switch. Automatic train stop differs from the concept of Automatic Train Control in that ATS usually does not feature an onboard speed control mechanism.\n\nThe invention of the fail-safe railway air brake provided an external means for stopping a train via a physical object opening a valve on the brake line to the atmosphere. Eventually known as \"train stops\" or \"trip stops\", the first mechanical ATS system was installed in France in 1878 with some railroads in Russia following suit using a similar system in 1880. In 1901 Union Switch and Signal Company developed the first North American automatic train stop system for the Boston Elevated Railway. This system was soon adopted by the New York City Subway and other rapid transit systems in the United States.\n\nMechanical ATS was more popular on rapid transit systems and dedicated commuter rail than freight or long distance passenger lines due to a combination of the increased complexity found in mainline railroad operations, the risk of inadvertent activation by debris or other wayside appliances, and the danger of emergency brake applications at high speeds. Moreover, the forces involved in a physical tripping action can begin to damage both the wayside and vehicle borne equipment at speeds over .\n\nIn 1910 the Pennsylvania and Long Island Rail Roads installed a mechanical ATS system covering various lines to New York Penn Station using the patented Hall trip value which was designed to prevent inadvertent activations from debris, however the system was only installed on locomotives and multiple units traveling to Penn Station and did not see further adoption.\n\nWhile similar in operation mechanical systems around the world are generally incompatible due to the wide variety of vehicle dimensions and track gauge which will result in the mechanical stopping devices not engaging the onboard valve.\n\nElectronic systems make use of electric currents or electromagnetic fields to trigger some action in the locomotive cab. While mechanical systems were generally limited to venting the brake pipe and triggering an emergency stop, electronic systems can trigger other actions such as an acknowledgment from the driver, cutting power or a less severe application of the brakes. Without physical contact electronic systems could be used with higher speeds, limited only by the equipment's ability to sense the signal from stop devices.\n\nThe first such electronic system was Crocodile (train protection system) installed on French railways starting in 1872 which used an electrified contact rail to trigger an acknowledgment from the driver. If no such acknowledgment was made in 5 seconds the train would be stopped. In the UK the Great Western Railway implemented a similar system in 1906 dubbed Automatic Train Control that served as the template for the magnetic based Automatic Warning System, which ultimately replaced it starting in the 1950s.\n\nIn the United States, the General Railway Signal corporation introduced its Intermittent Inductive Automatic Train Stop system in the 1920s which made use of inductive loops in a \"shoe\" mounted outside of the running rails. This system was also of the acknowledgment type and was adopted by several railroads, continuing to see service as of 2013.\n\nIn 1954, Japan introduced ATS-B, the first known variant of ATS. In 1967, ATS-S (and its various supplements) was invented, the first non-contact-based ATS to be used; in 1974, ATS-P was used for the first time, and in 1986, H-ATS was invented.\n\nThe majority of systems meeting the definition of Automatic Train Stop in the United States are mechanical trip stop systems associated with rapid transit lines built in the first half of the 20th century. Since 1951 ATS has been required by the Interstate Commerce Commission (later the Federal Railroad Administration) as a minimum safety requirement to allow passenger trains to exceed a speed limit of . The regulatory requirement refers to a system that triggers an alert in the cab of the locomotive whenever the train passes a restrictive wayside signal and that then requires the locomotive engineer to respond to the alert within a set period of time before the brakes are automatically applied.\n\nThe most popular implementation of ATS for the mainline railroad industry was made by the General Railway Signal company starting in the 1920s and consisted of inductive coils mounted just outside the right hand rail in relation to the direction of travel. Often referred to as just ATS in railroad operating books, the full name of the system is Intermittent Inductive Automatic Train Stop to differentiate it from mechanical systems being offered at the time. The popularity of ATS as a train protection mechanism fell after the introduction of track coded cab signals in the 1930s.\n\nMany trains in Japan are equipped with this system. The ATS systems in Japan are slightly similar to those used in the United States, but are mostly transponder-based. The first ATS systems in Japan were introduced in the 1920s, but did not become commonplace until the late-1960s as a result of the Mikawashima train crash which occurred in 1962. \nBelow is a list of ATS systems that are specific to Japan only:\n\n\nIn addition, various private-sector railways and subway lines have adopted their own versions of the ATS system since 1963. Like the ATS systems used by the railways in the JR Group, they are transponder-based as well, but are generally incompatible with the ATS systems used by JR.\n\n\nIn Wellington only a few signals at a converging junction are fitted with mechanical ATS. All electric trains are fitted.\n\nSome Korail and subway lines are equipped with this system.\n\nBuenos Aires Underground lines and have ATS equipped, while , , and have the more advanced Communications-based train control.\n\nMany Taiwan Railways Administration trains are equipped with the Japanese ATS-SN and ATS-P systems, which serve as fallback for an ATP system introduced in 2006 (based on ETCS Level 1), of which the latter system replaced the older AWS system originally introduced in 1978 on some express trains.\n\nSome Manchester Metrolink services are ATS equipped, however this is being phased out due to the introduction of line of sight signalling.\n\nLondon Underground lines are universally fitted with ATS equipment. This comprises a trip arm outside the left-hand running rail, and an air valve known as a tripcock on the leading bogie of the train. When the applicable signal shows 'danger', the trip arm is held up by a spring. If a train attempts to pass the signal, the trip arm makes contact with the tripcock. This opens the tripcock, which is connected to the train pipe of the air brakes, and causes an emergency brake application to be made. When the signal shows 'clear', the stop arm is lowered by compressed air.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2275377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275377", "title": "Uruma", "text": "Uruma\n\nUruma is noted for its role in hosting large-scale refugee camps and the initial organization of local government of Okinawa immediately after the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. As such the city is considered the home of the starting point of the restoration of civil life in Okinawa immediately after the end of World War II. United States maintains four military bases in Uruma, some of which span other municipalities in Okinawa: Kadena Ammunition Storage Area, Camp McTureous, Camp Courtney, and White Beach Naval Facility. The bases cover 12.97% of the total area of the city. Two controversies have surrounded American military bases in Uruma: the 1959 Okinawa F-100 crash which killed and injured numerous students and residents, and the transport of Agent Orange via the White Beach Naval Facility for testing in Okinawa in the early 1960s as part of the classified Project AGILE.\n\nIn the Japanese language the name of the city is written using the hiragana syllabary instead of kanji characters because, according to the city, it looks endearing and soft. The name of the city of Uruma comes from a poetic name for Okinawa Island. A folk etymology, which was adopted by the city itself, segments \"uruma\" into \"uru\" (fine sand or coral in Okinawan) and \"*ma\" (island?). Another theory relates it to \"urumaa\", meaning cricket in Okinawan.\n\nThe Okinawan origin of the word, however, has long been questioned. In fact, it was in mainland Japan that the word was first attested and eventually came to refer to Okinawa. The first known reference to \"uruma\" is a waka poem by Fujiwara no Kintō in the early 11th century. He compared a woman's coldheartedness to the incomprehensible speech of drifters from \"Ureung\" Island (迂陵島, identified as Ulleung Island) of Goryeo Kingdom, which Kintō called Silla, a practice rather common in Heian-period Japan. However, the association with Ulleung Island was soon forgotten because the reference to Silla was dropped when his poem was recorded in the \"Senzai Wakashū\" (1188). Thereafter waka poets only thought \"uruma\" as an island somewhere outside Japan with an unintelligible language. At the same time, it evoked a sense of familiarity because the phrase \"uruma no ichi\" (market in Uruma) was poetically associated with Mino Province. From the viewpoint of mainland Japanese poets, Okinawa might have been an ideal referent of \"uruma\" because, despite the exotic name of \"Ryūkyū\", the first reference to Okinawan-composed waka poems was as early as 1496. The first known identification of \"uruma\" as Okinawa Island can be found in the \"Moshiogusa\" (1513), but the association remained weak for some time. For example, Hokkaido, in addition to Okinawa, was referred to as \"uruma\" in the \"Shōzaishū\" (1597). The mainland Japanese poetic practice was adopted by Okinawan waka poets in the late 17th century. The \"Omoidegusa\" (1700), a purely Japanese poetic diary by Shikina Seimei, is known for its extensive use of the word \"uruma\".\n\nIn the Sanzan Period (1322–1429), or Three Kingdom period, numerous gusuku, or castles were built across Okinawa Island. The area of present-day Uruma fell under the control of the Chūzan Kingdom, which covered the central area of Okinawa Island and its nearby islands. The Katsuren area of Uruma became notably prosperous in the mid-15th century. Katsuren Castle, and a surrounding jōkamachi castle town, were constructed in this period.\n\nUnder the Ryukyu Kingdom six magiri, a type of regional administrative district in pre-modern Okinawa, covered areas of present-day Uruma: 'Nzatō Magiri (parts of which were also located in present-day Okinawa City), Gushichaa Magiri, Kachin magiri, and Yunagushiku Magiri. Nakagushiku Magiri included Tsuken Island.\n\nThe Ryūkyū Kingdom ended in 1872 with the establishment of the Ryūkyū Domain, which was soon abolished with the establishment of Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. The existing system of magiri in Uruma continued with the establishment of Okinawa Prefecture. The magiri were abolished in 1907 under Imperial Edict 46, and the central government extended the establishment of cities, towns, and village organization to Okinawa Prefecture. In 1908 the area of present-day Uruma was reorganized as the five villages of Misato, Gushikawa, Katsuren, and Yonashiro.\n\nIn the pre-war period Uruma had the most productive sugarcane industry in Okinawa Prefecture due to sources of irrigation and fertile soil.\n\nThe areas of present-day Uruma were affected in World War II during the initial part of the Battle of Okinawa. L-Day, the initial land invasion of Okinawa Island, occurred on April 1, 1945. American forces swept across the island quickly, and by April 5 had secured the entirety of the Katsuren Peninsula. A smaller invasion force captured Tsuken Island on the same day, and encountered stiff resistance from the Japanese military. Tsuken Island was completely devastated by fire in the battle. After the capture of Tsuken, American forces reached Ikei Island on April 9, thus securing all the Yokatsu Islands. The area that became Ishikawa was a major refugee camp set up by the American military near the end of the battle.\n\nThe Okinawa Advisory Council, the predecessor to the United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands was established in Ishikawa, and temporarily became the political, educational, and cultural center of Okinawa. In 1946 the Advisory Council was moved to the village of Sashiki, now a district of Nanjō, refugees began a large-scale movement to return to their homes, and the population of Ishikawa decreased rapidly. In the aftermath of World War II the Ishikawa area of Uruma was used as a large-scale refugee camp.

The Ōgawa Aji, or regional ruler of the Ōgawa Magiri of the Ryūkyū Kingdom, occupied the castle for several generations. For this reason the castle is also known as the \"Ōgawa gusuku\". Details of the history of both the castle and the aji are unclear, and no archaeological excavation has been carried out on the castle. It was likely built in the 14th century. The Ōgawa reached their greatest period of prosperity in the 15th century. At some point the castle was destroyed by the army of the Ryūkyū Kingdom. The outer gate of Agena Castle no longer exists, but as the inner gate is bored through the limestone foundation and is surrounded on both sides with quarried rocks, it still exists. The inner gate is an early example of an arched castle gate, and is protected as a national treasure of Japan.

The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Okinawa Naval Base is located directly adjacent to White Beach.\n\nThe White Beach Naval Facility was built at the end of the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. 95,000 military engineers arrived on Okinawa Island to convert the island into a staging area for an invasion of the Japanese main islands. While the island was not used for an invasion of Japan, White Beach remained a permanent military facility. White Beach played a role in the controversial Agent Orange testing in Okinawa in the early 1960s under an American program to test unconventional weapons as part of the classified Project AGILE. Logbooks of the privately owned merchant marine ship SS \"Schuyler Otis Bland\" show that chemicals agents were delivered to White Beach under armed guard on April 25, 1962, then transported to other areas of the island.\n\n\n1959 Kadena Air Base F-100 crash\n\n"}

{"id": "2275388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275388", "title": "Jack Duckworth", "text": "Jack Duckworth\n\nJohn \"Jack\" Duckworth is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, \"Coronation Street\", played by Bill Tarmey. The character debuted on-screen during the episode broadcast on 28 November 1979. Jack was introduced by executive producer Bill Podmore. Tarmey had previously appeared as a background character in many episodes featuring scenes in the Rovers Return, including some occasional speaking lines.\n\nMore than twenty years after first appearing, Tarmey eventually cut down filming due to problems with his health and often contemplated leaving the series. In April 2010, it was announced that Tarmey would leave the series for good later that year. His last appearance was broadcast on 8 November 2010, with ITV also airing a tribute documentary for him. Having been in the show for 31 years, he was one of the longest-serving characters.\n\nJack's storylines have focused on his long-standing marriage to his wife Vera (Liz Dawn) which has been complex and at times been described as \"rocky\". Other storylines include coping with his wayward son Terry (Nigel Pivaro) and his hobby for pigeon keeping. In his final storyline, he was portrayed as having incurable non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Jack has been characterised through his \"joyless and gloomy\" life in which he has a string of dead-end jobs and his wife's death, but continued to pass witty remarks on life. Television critics have described Jack as a loveable rogue type character and have favoured his relationship with Vera. His exit storyline was fairly documented in the media, receiving positive reactions and many state he is fondly remembered for his love of pigeons.\n\nWhilst Jack is working a fairground ride, the waltzer, he meets Vera Burton (Liz Dawn), and they soon begin a relationship. When Vera announces that she is pregnant with his baby, Jack agrees to marry her. Even after discovering this is a false alarm, Jack still takes her hand in marriage. During a trip to the United States, Jack confesses to being two years younger than Vera is aware, as he had lied at their wedding, making out that he was older than he really was in an attempt to impress a young Vera. Since they had not been legally married, they make their marriage official by tying the knot in the famous Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. A pregnant Vera gives birth to a son, whom they named Terry (Nigel Pivaro).\n\nJack makes his first appearance on 28 November 1979 when Vera forces him to attend the wedding of her friend and colleague Ivy Tilsley's (Lynne Perrie) son Brian (Christopher Quinten) to Gail Potter (Helen Worth). He returns in 1981 and for almost two years, appears on a recurring basis. Jack and Vera move into the street in 1983, much to the dismay of many of Weatherfield's residents. Prior to Jack's 1979 debut, Bill Tarmey often appeared as an extra in The Rovers Return Inn, playing darts. Jack later has an affair with Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), which he later regrets. Jack enrols with a video dating agency in 1983, referring to himself as \"Vince St. Clair\" and obtains a white suit, gold medallion and phoney trans-Atlantic accent. Vera also takes part in this. She refers to herself as \"Carole Munroe\", and is shocked when she sees Jack's video. She arranges to meet him in The Rovers Return, wearing a ginger wig, claiming to be a rich widow. When she turns around, Jack is shocked to see his wife staring back at him and she chases him out of the pub much to the amusement of the other customers.\n\nTerry causes trouble for Jack and Vera through his various relationships with women. He dates neighbour Andrea Clayton (Caroline O'Neill) in 1985 and she becomes pregnant, sparking a feud between the Claytons and the Duckworths. At Ivy's engagement party to George Wardle in The Rovers, Jack asks Andrea's father Harry Clayton (Johnny Leeze) if they are sure Terry is the father and Harry punches him. The Claytons later move away. In 1992, Terry is released from prison to marry his pregnant girlfriend Lisa Horton (Caroline Milmoe) and uses the ceremony to escape. Lisa moves to Weatherfield from her home town of Blackpool and begins a relationship with local bookie Des Barnes (Philip Middlemiss) and moves in with him, a decision which infuriates Vera. While Jack is more sympathetic towards Lisa, knowing Terry will never stand by his wife and child, he nonetheless feels he has to side with his wife. Lisa gives birth to a baby boy whom she names Tommy and five months later, Lisa is killed after being run over by a car, and Jack and Vera are delighted when Tommy comes to live with them. Jack and Vera find it hard to cope financially, but Terry takes Tommy off of them and sells him to Lisa's parents Jeff and Doreen Horton and he goes to live with them in Blackpool. Jack and Vera are devastated and a furious argument with Terry follows, resulting in Jack punching Terry and disowning him. Jack and Vera were blessed with another grandson, Brad, after Terry's fling with Tricia Armstrong (Tracy Brabin). Jack also develops a paternal relationship with Tricia's son from her first marriage, Jamie (Joseph Gilgun).\n\nJack and Vera later became surrogate parents for Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall), whose mother had been imprisoned for assault. Jack considers Tyrone as more of a son than Terry had ever been. Jack is fond of pigeons though Vera hates them, and she once tricks him into believing that she has cooked him a pigeon pie. Jack once agrees to sell his dead body for a large amount of cash to an artist (Maggie McCarthy) who enjoys painting stuffed humans, so he could buy Vera a Christmas present. When Vera discovers this, she argues with the woman, who then turns up, inspired by Vera. They agree to both pose nude for the artist, but on condition that they would be buried as normal. The Duckworths celebrate their Golden wedding anniversary with a party at The Rovers in August 2007. After the couple plan to relocate to Blackpool, Jack discovers Vera has died in her sleep in her armchair on 18 January 2008, devastating many of Weatherfield's residents. This prompts Jack to abandon the move to Blackpool and stay in Weatherfield, although he still offers No. 9 to Tyrone and his girlfriend Molly Compton (Vicky Binns); though they insist that he remain as a lodger. Months later, Jack's grandson Paul Clayton (Tom Hudson), having returned to Weatherfield previously, confesses to the police to burning down Valandro's, Leanne Battersby's (Jane Danson) restaurant. He also confesses this to Jack who is disgusted with his grandson's behaviour and tells him that he is Terry's son. Despite his disgust, Jack offers Paul £10,000 that he has received from the house, on the condition that Paul faces prison. However, Paul cannot face it and decides to flee the country. This reassures Jack that Paul is different from Terry. When Molly's aunt Pam Hobsworth (Kate Anthony) later moves into No. 9, Jack decides to spend a few months in Blackpool. Upon his return, he describes at Tyrone and Molly's wedding in January 2009 that Tyrone is the son he and Vera had always wanted. Later that year, Jack meets Connie Rathbone (Rita May), a widow and fellow pigeon enthusiast. The two become good friends, although Tyrone feels that Jack's behaviour is disrespectful to the memory of Vera. Jack soon goes on holiday with Connie to Spain and lies to Tyrone and Molly that he is returning to Blackpool. When he comes back, Tyrone discovers the truth and is unhappy with Jack. Tyrone begins to soften towards Connie but is still shocked when Jack announces that he is moving in with Connie and he leaves Weatherfield on 21 September 2009.\n\nFollowing him moving in with Connie, Jack's appearances on the show became intermittent. In November 2009, Jack and Connie join Tyrone in the Rovers for a drink. After Connie leaves, Jack tells Tyrone that he is worried that she wants more than companionship. Jack then hides out at Tyrone's until Connie catches up with him and reveals it is only a misunderstanding about her sleepwalking, much to Jack's relief. Jack and Connie join Tyrone, Bill Webster (Peter Armitage) and Pam on Christmas Day 2009. Jack is present once again in early-2010, when Molly and Tyrone are having marriage difficulties and is seen in the Rovers after the funeral of Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) in May 2010. Jack appears on 9 September 2010 to visit Molly, after she has just given birth, and is told her and Tyrone's son will be named Jack in honour of him. In October 2010, Jack moves back in with Tyrone and Molly and they suspect that he has fallen out with Connie. Jack initially tells Tyrone that he has simply missed living with them both. However, when Connie turns up at the house and cryptically demands why Jack hasn't told them the real reason for his stay, he is forced to reveal the truth. On 8 October 2010, Jack tells a Tyrone that he has an incurable form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and only has weeks to live, leaving Tyrone devastated. He returns to No. 9 to live out the remainder of his days, and makes Tyrone promise that they will make the most of his last few weeks. During his final weeks, Jack strives to perform acts of kindness for those around him. He sends Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) tickets for the opera after hearing her say that she always wanted to go. After seeing Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) collecting money in the Rovers to repair the roof of the local church, he anonymously donates over £2,000 to the fund. When Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) confides in Jack about problems that he is having with his wife Claire (Julia Haworth), he attempts to reconcile the couple by encouraging them to talk to one another. After baby Jack's christening on 5 November 2010, Jack is devastated when he overhears a conversation between Molly and Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell), in which Kevin reveals that he is the father of baby Jack, and not Tyrone as the result of the affair they had.\n\nOn 8 November 2010, Tyrone organises a party for Jack's 74th birthday in the Rovers Return. Jack reveals to Molly that he overheard her and Kevin discussing baby Jack's paternity. Jack does not condemn Molly and he admits he and Vera had both done the same as she had to each other, but tells her that Tyrone never would and pleads with her to move the family away from Weatherfield. Later, after seeing Tyrone and Molly happy together with baby Jack, he decides to quietly slip out of his own party saying his final words to Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and Carla Connor (Alison King) and then waving goodbye to Ken Barlow (William Roache), who raises a glass to him as he leaves. Jack goes home and whilst listening to a Matt Monro record which Tyrone had given him as a present, he dies in his armchair and is joined by the ghost of Vera, who tells him off, yet again, for his scruffy appearance. She tells Jack she'll be late for a bus and Jack's spirit leaves his body and gets out of his chair and dances with Vera and they share a kiss. Some time later, Tyrone, Molly and Connie return home to find Jack dead in his chair, and a tearful Tyrone says his last words to him \"Good Night Dad\". Jack and Vera's ashes are later scattered off Blackpool Pier by Tyrone and Connie.\n\nUnlike the creation process with many other roles, no auditions were held for the part of Jack. Actor William Tarmey had previously been an extra in the serial, and in 1978 he played the small credited part of \"Jack Rowe\". He was offered the guest role of Jack Duckworth for two episodes in November 1979. Of his previous credits, Tarmey states: \"I'd worked on \"Coronation Street\" for about ten years throwing darts in the background and whilst doing that I was doing little cameo parts, on other programmes.\" Tarmey was later asked back for a handful of episodes in 1981 and was eventually asked to become a regular cast member a year later. Tarmey had prepared for this with the help of fellow cast members and of this he adds: \"I've had so many helping hands through the years from Jean [Alexander] and Liz [Dawn] and Julie [Goodyear] and Bill [Roache] [who played Hilda Ogden, Vera Duckworth, Bet Lynch and Ken Barlow respectively], from them all\".\n\nIn 1997, executive producer Brian Park axed a number of characters; Tarmey has stated he was so tired of seeing his fellow cast members worrying about their jobs that he asked to be written out, but Park decided to keep him on. In 2001, the serial imposed a series of cuts on salaries as part of cost-cutting efforts. This resulted in Tarmey considering leaving, but producers decided against lowering his salary and convinced him to stay. In 2004, Tarmey extended his contract further along with his on-screen wife Dawn. In June 2008, he spoke of his desire to continue in the role.\n\nFrom September 2009 onwards, Tarmey filmed on an episodic basis. In a storyline, Jack moved away from Coronation Street but continued to make occasional appearances at the Rovers and in the cafe. The reason for this was due to Tarmey's increasing health problems. On 9 April 2010, it was announced Tarmey would leave the show. His final scenes were broadcast on 8 November 2010. On 9 April 2010, it was announced that Bill Tarmey had quit his role of Jack in the show's fiftieth anniversary year. Speaking of his decision to quit, Tarmey stated: \"I've had the most amazing 30 years playing Jack. Because of him I've made fantastic friends and travelled all over the world. I'll be sorry to say goodbye.\" Filming Jack's final scenes upset Tarmey, of this he stated: \"It was delightful. And very moving. It was a case of 'Pass the hand towel' [...] you know, filming those scenes was difficult. I'm leaving my other family. I've worked with all these people for 30-odd years and it was impossible for me to act or watch the death scene and cut that off.\"\n\nITV publicity describe him as being fond of pigeons and betting whilst disliking household chores. Stuart Heritage of newspaper \"The Guardian\" describes Jack as having \"a constant downbeat aura of a person who knows that his entire life has been a joyless procession of gloomy disappointments.\" Another reporter of the newspaper, Mark Lawson, described Jack as \"A pigeon-fancying, flat-cap-wearing, wise-cracking, philandering, Sinatra-loving Lancashire lad, Jack epitomised the vivid character comedy in which the serial specialises.\"\n\nIn 1991 Tarmey spoke of Jack's changes in attitude over his early years in the book \"Life on the Street\". \"Jack has settled down and matured a bit, he has accepted things with a kind of middle-aged resignation\", Tarmey stated. He also branded Jack's days of chasing \"birds\" as over and some of his greatest loves as being \"booze and barmaids\". Jack has a \"strange moral code\" when it comes to his marriage. Tarmey brands one of Jack's good qualities as being the fact he is not a thief, but did add \"He regards stealing Alec Gilroy's (Roy Barraclough) beer as one of the perks of his job\".\n\nJack's relationship with Vera Burton (Liz Dawn) was always up and down, they had a rocky marriage and sometimes Jack appeared to show little care for her. Tarmey describes the first few decades in the following manner: \"He would never knowingly hurt people and he loves Vera, although he doesn't always like her. He will defend her to the death, unless the chap slagging her off is bigger than he is! Jack is not a thief either!\" In their \"hey-day\" they were dubbed as the modern day Stan (Bernard Youens) and Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) In their early days, Jack and Vera both had their fair share of dalliances. In 1982, whilst Vera was entertaining her own boyfriend, Jack had developed an attraction towards Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear). Tarmey recalls the scenes in which Jack and Bet flirt, stating he was nervous and had to have Goodyear's help. They believed the storyline was a turning point for the two and was written with wit. Dawn opines: \"It was very cleverly written, because Vera knew that Jack had a girlfriend on the side but she didn't know the other woman was Bet. So she chose Bet as someone to confide in, and she really opened her heart. It was quite moving as well as funny.\" This led to a classic showdown in the Rovers.\nIn another storyline Jack's son Terry sells his baby Tommy Duckworth (Darryl Edwards), leaving Jack and Vera devastated. When Jack and Vera realise what he has done, Jack punches Terry. The scenes made viewers happy to see Terry getting what hurt. Tarmey himself felt sadness because he knew how Jack felt: \"When I first saw the script I was very sad [...] I worked out the punch with Nigel and I missed him by a whisker. Since then I've had letters saying \"Well done for cracking him one\" from little old ladies, young women, kids, guys.\"\n\nOn 8 November 2010 Tarmey made his final appearance, with Jack dying in his armchair at his old Coronation Street house, following a birthday party at the Rovers. In Jack's final death scene he sees visions of Vera, which Dawn returned to film. Producer Phil Collinson explained why they decided to include her: \"It's something I've heard a lot. People say, 'When my mother was dying she saw my father' [...] It's a story I've heard a few people say. We're storytellers at the end of the day. Yes it's Coronation Street and yes it reflects real life, but we're storytellers.\" Whilst Executive producer Kieran Roberts opined that he would be surprised if anyone thought it was the wrong decision.\n\nJack appears in a theatrical version of the story of \"Coronation Street\" titled \"Corrie!\" in which Jack and Vera are shown as Terry sells their grandchild.\n\nIn January 1985, David Porter of current affairs magazine, \"Third Way\", criticised \"Coronation Street's\" attitude towards employment, stating that being unemployed seemed to not be a problem for some characters as they were either \"loved layabouts\" or \"acknowledged rogues\", like Jack. In Dorothy Catherine Anger's book \"Other worlds: society seen through soap opera\" she brands Jack as one of the \"middle aged men\" who \"over the years have, stymied their wives' efforts to be accepted as respectable\". Dorothy Hobson in her book \"Soap Opera\" stated that marriages never seem to last in the genre, but added that Jack and Vera were an exception, in her opinion it was because although he loved her, he was terrified of sex. Ian Wylie of \"The Guardian\" branded Jack and Vera as \"one of TV drama's most enduring – and real – double acts\". Channel Five's soap opera reporting website Holy Soap brands Jack's most memorable moments as being \"his Vince St Clair alias\" and \"when Jack returned home to find Vera had died in her sleep.\" The website has also branded him a \"pigeon fancier\" What's on TV describe Jack stating: \"Had a famously rocky marriage to Vera but widower Jack Duckworth (William Tarmey) has mellowed over the years. Once a bit of a jack-the-lad, he's now more of a 'Jack the kipper', as he's enjoying retirement and taking life easy.\"\n\nTV critic Jim Shelley for the \"Daily Mirror\" spoke of his regret that Jack Duckworth would be leaving the show: \"Soap characters come and go, but it's a genuine shame that, after 31 years, Bill Tarmey is finally leaving \"Coronation Street\". It's hard to think of a more popular or nicer character than Jack Duckworth. Decent people are few and far between in soaps. Viewers loved Stan and Hilda Ogden for example. But you couldn't say that they were as warm or reassuring a presence as Jack. Of course he was part of one of the great loving couples/double acts in Street history.\" 11.64 million viewers tuned in to see Jack's final appearance.\n\nJack's final scenes on the show were praised by fans and critics alike. Jim Shelley called Jack's death scene with the ghostly appearance of Vera, \"one the most moving scenes ever seen in soap\". Mark Lawson of \"The Guardian\" described Jack and Vera's last dance as a great piece of social realism. As a tribute to the character ITV broadcast a short documentary profiling Jack's life in the serial. 7 million viewers tuned into watch the show. Stuart Heritage of \"The Guardian\" stated that Jack had iconic accessories which are his \"golden-era glasses\" stuck together with Elastoplast and his vest. They also commented on his pigeon keeping hobby, stating: \"Forget Vera Duckworth, the one true love of Jack's life was his flock of pigeons.\" Lucy Mangan writing for \"The Guardian\" reviewed the serial's theatrical piece \"Corrie!\", stating: \"The scene in which Terry arrives to take his son away from grandparents Jack and Vera is enough to precipitate a Proustian rush of tearful memories. All those years of misery the wretched Terry caused his parents – oh, Jack's bitter resignation! – come flooding back.\" In the \"Morley Observer & Advertiser\" a columnist expressed their disappointment Jack and Vera were onscreen when he wanted to watch football and opined \"difference is that the dramatic acting in the football is better\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2275394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2275394", "title": "Endostatin", "text": "Endostatin\n\nEndostatin is a naturally occurring, 20-kDa C-terminal fragment derived from type XVIII collagen. It is reported to serve as an anti-angiogenic agent, similar to angiostatin and thrombospondin.\n\nEndostatin is a broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitor and may interfere with the pro-angiogenic action of growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\n\nEndostatin is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. It was first found secreted in the media of non-metastasizing mouse cells from a hemangioendothelioma cell line in 1997 and was subsequently found in humans. It is produced by proteolytic cleavage of collagen XVIII, a member of the multiplexin family that is characterized by interruptions in the triple helix creating multiple domains, by proteases such as cathepsins. Collagen is a component of epithelial and endothelial basement membranes. Endostatin, as a fragment of collagen 18, demonstrates a role of the ECM in suppression of neoangiogenesis. Pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors can also be created by proteolysis during coagulation cascades. Endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis are present in both normal tissue and cancerous tissue. Overall, endostatin down regulates many signaling cascades like ephrin, TNF-α, and NFκB signaling as well as coagulation and adhesion cascades. Other collagen derived antiangiogenic factors include arresten, canstatin, tumstatin, α 6 collagen type IV antiangiogenic fragment, and restin.\n\nHuman monomeric endostatin is a globular protein containing two disulfide bonds: Cys162−302 and Cys264−294. It folds tightly, has a zinc binding domain at the N-terminus of the protein, and has a high affinity for heparin through an 11 arginine basic patch. Endostatin also binds all heparan sulfate proteoglycans with low affinity. Oligomeric endostatin (trimer or dimer) binds mainly with laminin of the basal lamina.\n\nIn-vitro studies have shown endostatin blocks the proliferation and organization of endothelial cells into new blood vessels. In animal studies endostatin inhibited angiogenesis and growth of both primary tumors and secondary metastasis.\n\nEndostatin suppresses angiogenesis through many pathways affecting both cell viability and movement. Endostatin represses cell cycle control and anti-apoptosis genes in proliferating endothelial cells, resulting in cell death. Endostatin blocks pro-angiogenic gene expression controlled by c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) by interfering with TNFα activation of JNK. It reduces the growth of new cells by inhibiting cyclin D1. As a result, cells arrest during G1 phase and enter apoptosis. Alteration of FGF signal transduction by endostatin inhibits the migration of endothelial cells through disruption of cell-matrix adhesions, cell-cell adhesions, and cytoskeletal reorganization. By binding integrin α5β1 on endothelia cells it inhibits the signaling pathways of Ras and Raf kinases and decreases ERK-1 and p38 activity. Endostatin binding and clustering of integrins causes co-localization with caveolin-1 and activates non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and mobility. Other receptor interactions include the VEGF-R2/KDR/Flk-1 receptor on human umbilical vein endothelial cells.\n\nEndostatin may prevent activity from certain metalloproteinase. Several studies have focused on the downstream effects of endostatin reception. These studies have estimated that endostatin may significantly affect 12% of genes used by human endothelial cells. Although endostatin signaling may affect this vast number of genes, the downstream affects appear surprisingly limited. Endostatin reception seems to only affect angiogenesis that arrives from pathogenic sources, such as tumors. Processes associated with angiogenesis, such as wound healing and reproduction, are seemingly not affected by endostatin. The result is possible because pathogenic-derived angiogenesis usually involves signaling through integrins, which are directly affected by endostatin.\n\nAlthough this process by which endostatin works is not fully understood, it involves metalloproteases and endopeptidases that digest components of the extracellular matrix. Several similar endogeneous angiogenic factors are produced from matrix components in this fashion. For example, perlecan degradation can yield endorepellin which functions as an anti-angiogenic factor. Collectively, these products are thought to balance regulation between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors outside epithelial and endothelial layers.\n\nAmong anti-angiogenesis inhibitors, endostatin has a wide range of anti-cancer spectrum targets, increasing its significance since synthetic inhibitors usually have single targets and struggle with toxicity. Endostatin has several characteristics that may be advantageous to cancer therapy. First of all, endogenous endostatin has been described as \"the least toxic anti-cancer drug in mice\". Furthermore, neither resistance nor toxicity to endostatin occur in humans. Also, endostatin has been estimated to affect 12% of the human genome. This reveals a broad spectrum of activity focused on preventing angiogenesis. This is very different from single-molecule therapies, and may change how cancer therapies are designed: drugs may be designed to target a wide range of genes instead of one particular protein. However, endostatin does not affect all tumors. For example, cancers that may have extreme pro-angiogenic activity through VEGF may overcome the anti-angiogenic effects of endostatin.\n\nEndostatin is currently being studied as part of cancer research. Prior results indicated that endostatin can be beneficial in combinations with other medicines, but endostatin alone gave no significant improvements in tumor/disease progression.\n\nIn a Phase I clinical trial of Endostatin, of the 19 patients treated, 12 were switched out of the trial by their physicians due to continued progression of their disease. Two patients continued to be treated, and the remaining patients withdrew on their own. The trial, designed primarily to demonstrate safety, indeed showed that the drug was safe and well tolerated (at the dosages used).\n\nIn a Phase II clinical trial of Endostatin, 42 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors or carcinoid tumors were treated. Of the 40 patients which could be evaluated for a radiologic response, none experienced partial response to therapy, as defined by World Health Organization criteria.\n\nThe conclusion from the trial was that, \"Treatment with Endostatin did not result in significant tumor regression in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.\"\n\nA phase III clinical trial was carried out on 493 histology or cytology-confirmed stage IIIB and IV NSCLC patients with a life expectancy >3 months. Patients were treated with Endostar (rh-endostatin, YH-16), a recombinant endostatin product, in combination with vinorelbine and cisplatin (a standard chemotherapeutic regimen). The addition of Endostar to the standard chemotherapeutic regimen in these advanced NSCLC patients resulted in significant and clinically meaningful improvement in response rate, median time to progression, and clinical benefit rate compared with the chemotherapeutic regimen alone.\n\nEndostatin may also be useful as a therapeutic for inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis as well as Crohn disease, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, and endometriosis by reducing the infiltration of inflammatory cells through invading angiogenesis.\nDown syndrome patients seem to be protected from diabetic retinopathy due to an additional copy of chromosome 21, and elevated expression of endostatin.\n\n"}

It is originally a Soviet-type honor, and is continued by several nations including Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. It was also awarded to cities and fortresses for collective efforts in heroic feats. Each hero receives a medal for public display, special privileges and rights for life, and the admiration and respect of the nation. Some countries without Soviet connections also award Hero honours.\n\nThe first hero title established, \"Hero of the Soviet Union\", was created by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 16 April 1934. The identifying badge, the \"Gold Star Medal\", was not created until 1 August 1939. The title was awarded for \"\"personal or collective deeds of heroism rendered to the USSR or socialist society\"\" and it was awarded to both military personnel and civilians.\n\nThe second hero title was \"Hero of Socialist Labor\", also created by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, was established on 27 December 1938. Its badge, the \"Hammer and Sickle Medal\", was created on 22 May 1940. The title was awarded for heroic labor achievements which significantly increased production, \"\"thereby promoting the national economy, science, culture, might, and glory of the USSR.\"\"\n\nEach \"Hero of the Soviet Union\" and \"Hero of Socialist Labor\" was given the highest Soviet award, the Order of Lenin, and a diploma describing the heroic accomplishment.\n\nA \"Hero of Socialist Labor\" held the same official stature as a \"Hero of the Soviet Union\", with identical rights and privileges, but the title's prestige was eroded by the sheer numbers awarded (over 19,000 compared to 12,745).\n\nThe third hero title was \"Mother Heroine\", established on 8 July 1944 by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The title was awarded for bearing and raising a large family, usually meaning 10 or more children.\n\nThe Soviet Union awarded the title to twelve (12) cities and one fortress for outstanding heroism during the Eastern Front (1941–1945).\n\nThe twelve Soviet cities awarded the title \"Hero-City\" are\n\nThe one fortress awarded the title \"Hero-Fortress\" is Brest.\n\nEach was awarded a Gold Star Medal to attach to its banner, and is allowed to the image of the medal on its coat of arms.\n\nRepeat awards of the titles \"Hero of the Soviet Union\" and \"Hero of Socialist Labor\" were allowed until the practice was abolished during perestroika. Afterwards, each title could be awarded to a recipient only once in their lifetime.\n\nSeveral nations with communist governments other than the Soviet Union, many part of the Warsaw Pact and the Eastern Bloc, adopted their own hero titles. These titles closely followed the Soviet model.\n\nNot all communist or socialist nations issued hero titles. Conversely, some nations that issued hero titles were not affiliated with the Soviet Union or communism.\n\n\nThe titles \"Hero of the Soviet Union\" and \"Hero of Socialist Labor\" were awarded until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which resulted in 15 independent republics. Each nation eventually began issuing their own titles, orders and decorations.\n\nSome republics, like the Baltic republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, did not create hero titles. Others, such as Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, continue with their own successor hero titles. The award criteria for these titles were kept largely intact.\n\nUkraine was the only former Soviet republic to continue the two-hero award system from the time of its creation in 1998: the military \"Order of the Gold Star\" for heroism, and the civilian \"Order of the State\" for labour. Kazakhstan introduced the Hero of Kazakhstan in 1993 and the Hero of Labour of Kazakhstan in 2008. Russia created the Hero of the Russian Federation in 1992 and the Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation in 2013. Georgia established the title \"National Hero\" and the decoration \"Order of National Hero\" in 2004. A breakaway region of Georgia, Abkhazia, has its own hero title, \"Hero of Abkhazia\".\n\n"}

Parisi won tag team titles in several organizations, including the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). He held the WWWF World Tag Team Championship from 1975 to 1976. As a singles wrestler, he also won the WWF International Heavyweight Championship.\n\nAfter retiring from wrestling, Pugliese continued to work in the industry and also operated a hotel and restaurant. He died in 2000 after suffering a major aneurysm.\n\nPugliese made his professional wrestling debut in Detroit, Michigan in 1961. He soon began competing in Canada, where he was a popular babyface (fan favorite) wrestler. In one of his first matches, he faced Gino Brito, who later became his long-time tag team partner. Pugliese and Brito moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1962 to wrestle in a promotion operated by Nick Gulas; they won the promotion's tag team title within two weeks of their arrival. Throughout his career, Pugliese formed many tag teams in various promotions with other wrestlers of Italian descent, including Dominic DeNucci, Tony Marino, and David Sammartino (who competed as Bruno Sammartino, Jr.).\n\nAlthough Pugliese often wrestled in Ontario throughout his career, he also competed as far away as Australia and Japan. In 1973, he participated in the first annual Champion Carnival tournament promoted by All Japan Pro Wrestling. He lost in the first round to Hiro Matsuda.\n\nPugliese also wrestled as a heel (villain) at times. He competed as \"Tenor\" Parisi; in this gimmick, he wore a white tuxedo and sang opera to anger the crowd.\n\nIn 1966, Pugliese began wrestling for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), where he was billed as the cousin of Bruno Sammartino. In this role, he was targeted by several heel wrestlers, who wanted to start feuds with the Sammartino family. On February 21, 1966, Pugliese teamed with Johnny Valentine to win the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship from Dan Miller and Dr. Bill Miller. They held the title belts for nine months before dropping them to the team of Baron Mikel Scicluna and Smasher Sloan on September 22. In this match, Valentine turned on Pugliese by awarding the championship to their opponents when Pugliese was injured.\n\nPugliese teamed with Miguel Pérez to challenge Scicluna and Sloan for the title on December 8, but Pérez sustained an injury during the match and was replaced by Spiros Arion. Pugliese and Arion won the match and the title; they held the belts for six months until June 1967. The team split up when Pugliese left the country briefly and Arnold Skaaland was named as co-holder of the championship in his place.\n\nIn December 1967, Pugliese teamed with Pedro Morales in the California-based World Wrestling Association (WWA). They won the WWA World Tag Team Championship by defeating Buddy Austin and Freddie Blassie. While defending the title, Pugliese also returned to the WWWF and began competing for the World Championship Wrestling in Australia. He teamed with Mario Milano to win the IWA World Tag Team Championship in April 1968. The team lost the belts to Skull Murphy and Killer Karl Kox in May, but Pugliese joined up with Dominic DeNucci to regain the title later that month. Although they dropped the title to Killer Kowalski and Bill Miller in June, Pugliese found a new partner in Don Leo Jonathan to regain the title on February 21, 1969. Two weeks later, The Spoiler and Pugliese's former partner Mario Milano (who had turned on Pugliese in the middle of a tag match with Spoiler and Kox to join their manager, Gary Hart) won the belts, but Pugliese and Jonathan regained them in a rematch later that month. Returning to the United States, Pugliese formed another tag team in Big Time Wrestling, a Texas-based division of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He teamed with Wahoo McDaniel to win the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship. Records from the time period in this promotion are unclear about the dates and title lineage, but there is a record of Pugliese and McDaniel holding the belts in 1969. The following year, Pugliese held the IWA World Tag Team Championship for the final time, as he teamed with Mark Lewin to win the belts from Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson on May 15, 1970. They defended the title for just over a month before losing it to Kurt and Karl Von Steiger.\n\nPugliese then joined the Buffalo, New York-based National Wrestling Federation (NWF). Once again, he found success teaming with Dominic DeNucci. The pair competed in a tournament for the vacant NWF World Tag Team Championship in January 1972; they made it to the final round but lost to the team of Mitsu Arakawa and Yoshino Sato. Pugliese and DeNucci continued to challenge for the title, and they defeated Arakawa and Sato in March to win the belts. They dropped the belts to Don and Johnny Fargo in May but regained them in a rematch the same month. Later that month, however, the Fargos regained the belts. Pugliese and DeNucci were unable to regain them, but Pugliese teamed up with Luis Martinez to win the title in December. Records are unclear as to whom they won the belts from and how they lost them.\n\nPugliese and DeNucci next traveled to Florida, where they competed for Championship Wrestling from Florida, an NWA territory. They defeated Toru Tanaka and Dick Slater to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in January 1975. Slater teamed with Johnny Weaver to win the belts back from Pugliese and DeNucci, however.\n\nPugliese's next major success came in the WWWF, where he had been wrestling sporadically since 1970 under the ring name Tony Parisi. He teamed with Gino Brito, who was wrestling as Louis Cerdan, to win the WWWF World Tag Team Championship on November 18, 1975. They defeated The Blackjacks (Blackjack Mulligan and Blackjack Lanza) to win the belts and held them for over six months. They eventually dropped the title in a match against The Executioners (a team composed of Killer Kowalski and Big John Studd, who wore masks to hide their identities) on May 11, 1976. Also in 1976, Parisi teamed with champion Bruno Sammartino in Madison Square Garden to defeat Ivan Koloff and Superstar Billy Graham.When the promotion (which had since been renamed the World Wrestling Federation) decided to reactivate the WWF International Heavyweight Championship in 1982, Parisi became the new champion. He lost the belt to his former partner, Gino Brito, that August.\n\nMuch of Pugliese's later career was spent wrestling as Tony Parisi in the Montreal-based Lutte Internationale (also known as International Wrestling). He traveled throughout the province, competing primarily as a tag team wrestler. In 1982, he teamed with Gino Brito to win the Canadian International Tag Team Championship from Gilles Poisson and Sailor White. Although they dropped the title to Pierre Lefebvre and Michel Dubois, they were able to regain the belts the following January from Lefebvre and Pat Patterson. Lefebvre teamed with Billy Robinson to win the title back, but Parisi and Brito won the title for the third time on December 12, 1983 from then-champions Lefebvre and Patterson. Once again, Lefebvre took on a new partner, this time Frenchy Martin, to win the belts from Parisi and Brito the following month. Parisi's final reign with the title began on February 20, 1984, when he joined up with Dino Bravo to regain the belts. Their title reign lasted for several months before Lefebvre and Martin defeated Parisi and Bravo to win back the championship.\n\nPugliese promoted wrestling shows in Niagara Falls after retiring from the sport. He also ran an annual wrestling show at the CHIN Picnic in Toronto.\n\nIn 1997, Pugliese returned to the ring to compete at the second Ilio DiPaolo tribute show promoted by World Championship Wrestling show. He reunited with partner Gino Brito in a tag team match, and the pair defeated Greg Valentine and Terry Funk by disqualification.\n\nPugliese is credited as the inspiration behind George \"The Animal\" Steele's gimmick of eating turnbuckle padding in the ring. A wrestler, who Steele believes was Pugliese, jokingly suggested the idea to Steele, who became well known for his fondness for turnbuckles.\n\nExisting autographs signed by Pugliese using his real name are thought to be rare.\n\nBorn in Italy, Pugliese moved to Thunder Bay, Ontario when he was nine years old, but soon moved to Niagara Falls, Ontario. He joined the YMCA in Niagara Falls and began amateur wrestling at the age of 16. He enjoyed listening to opera music and once referred to his LP albums as his \"prize possessions\".\n\nPugliese met Chiara Vaccaro in Niagara Falls, and the couple married in 1968. They had a daughter named Ida in 1976. He operated the Niagara Family Inn and Big Anthony's Restaurant in Niagara Falls with his family until he died from a major aneurysm on August 19, 2000.\n\nHe was related to Joseph Dorgan, who has wrestled under his relative's name as Johnny Parisi and is better known as Johnny Swinger.\n\n\n"}

Le Vell was found not guilty of all charges in September 2013, and briefly returned in early 2014, before taking another 3-month break from the show and returning once again.\n\nKevin is protective of his two daughters Rosie Webster (Emma Collinge, Helen Flanagan) and Sophie Webster (Ashleigh Middleton, Emma Woodward, Brooke Vincent) and their mother Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor). His notable storylines have seen him have an on-and-off relationship and marriage with Sally, his affairs with Natalie Horrocks (Denise Welch) and Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), the latter of which resulted in the birth of his illegitimate son Jack (Kyran Bowes) and subsequent second divorce from Sally. Kevin has since embarked on a romance with Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews).

Kevin is single until January 1986 when he meets Sally Seddon (Sally Dynevor) after accidentally splashing her whilst driving by in his work van. Their romance is often strained, due to Hilda's interference, as she feels that Kevin is too good for Sally and Sally is loyal to her family, who treat her badly. Kevin proposes repeatedly but Sally only accepts after Kevin risks his life saving Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) from a fire in 1986.

As a result, she gets careless so Sally discovers Kevin's infidelity but forgives him; however, they separate after Sally has an affair with Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington). They divorce in 1999 and Kevin refuses to allow Sally to take the girls back to live with her. She gave him residency while she found somewhere for her and the girls to live. Kevin learns that Greg was violent towards Sally in front of Rosie and Sophie but she is still awarded custody.\n\nLater that year, Kevin starts dating factory worker Alison Wakefield (Naomi Radcliffe), but she leaves him when it becomes clear that he is still in love with Sally. However, upon discovering that she is pregnant, they reconcile and marry in January 2000 with Kevin's daughters, Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh), Linda Sykes (Jacqueline Pirie) and Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) present. Their happiness doesn't last, however, when their newborn son Jake dies from a Group B streptococcal infection. The tragedy distresses Alison so much that she snatches Sarah-Louise Platt's (Tina O'Brien) newborn daughter, Bethany (Emily & Amy Walton), and commits suicide after giving baby Bethany to Kevin, leaving him devastated.\n\nIn the following months, Kevin dates Molly Hardcastle (Jacqueline Kingston), a nurse he meets through his friend, Martin Platt (Sean Wilson), whom he helps reconsider committing suicide when he learns that she is financial trouble. He ends the relationship when he realises that he is still in love with Sally and disrupts her wedding to Danny Hargreaves, telling him that he and Sally had a one night stand the night before he married Alison. Danny is disgusted and jilts Sally at the altar, leaving her devastated. As 2002 approaches, Kevin is determined to win Sally back and eventually convinces her to marry him again, although she warns him that it is only for their daughters' sakes. However, while engaged to Kevin, Sally has a brief fling with Alex, a painter, and decorator, which is revealed on their wedding day. Sally has to decide who she wants to be with and chooses Kevin, who has already forgiven her for her fling with Alex, and they remarry on 9 December 2002. During the following years, Kevin continues to work at the garage and becomes a brotherly figure to employee Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall). He also becomes good friends with his employee Tommy Harris (Thomas Craig), and they save Gail Hillman (Helen Worth) and her children, Sarah and David (Jack P. Shepherd) when her husband Richard Hillman (Brian Capron) tries to kill them in the Weatherfield canal in March 2003. Kevin is distraught when he discovers Tommy's body in the garage in March 2005 after he has been murdered by his daughter, Katy (Lucy-Jo Hudson). That same year sees Sally become a pushy parent, much to Kevin and Rosie's distress. She enrols Rosie into the prestigious Oakhill School after Rosie shows good potential at maths and forces Kevin to work longer hours so they can keep her there. Sally also starts working for car dealer Ian Davenport (Philip Bretherton), whose daughter, Gemma, is one of Rosie's friends at Oakhill. Sally and Ian have an affair later in 2005, which Rosie discovers when she walks in on them. When Kevin finds out, he is devastated and decides to end the marriage but Rosie persuades him not to, convincing him that Sally does love him and is only having the affair so that she can pay her tuition fees.\n\nIn 2007, Kevin is worried that Sally is having another affair, this time with teacher John Stape (Graeme Hawley). This transpires as John is tutoring Sally in A-level English. John's girlfriend Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) thinks the same but when she confronts Sally on Christmas Day 2007, Kevin, Sally and Fiz are stunned to learn that John is, in fact, having an affair with Rosie. Kevin severely beats John in the street and is subsequently arrested for assault, being sentenced to 28 days imprisonment. However, he only serves 14 days for good behaviour.\n\nKevin begins feuding with businessman Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) during July 2008, who manipulates Rosie into helping him persuade Kevin to sell him the garage. Kevin refuses but Tony invests in Kevin again, this time with Jimmy Dockerson (Robert Beck), Kevin responds angrily but forgets about Jimmy until he realises he is losing clients. He confronts the specific garage mechanic alone with Jimmy before confronting Tony about the situation, although Sally and Rosie deny Kevin's proof. Kevin later discovers that his tow truck has been stolen whilst helping a woman fix her car on a call-out. Although he has no proof, he knows that Tony is responsible and finds out that Rosie is giving Tony business documents from the garage. He is furious that she has betrayed him like that, even though she thought she was actually helping him with his ailing business. He gives half the business to Tyrone as an incentive to help him rebuild the business. As a result of his ploy to stop Tony from gaining control of it, Kevin is now a co-owner. Rosie later disappears, leaving Sally and Kevin distraught. They initially think that she has run off with lottery winnings from the \"Underworld\" syndicate until Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) admits that she stole Rosie's identity and used it to claim the money. Sally and Kevin receive a postcard from Rosie, which leads them to believe that she is in Holyhead and Sally goes there, searching for her to no avail. Kevin and Sally are reunited with Rosie on 5 November 2008, when Fiz discovers that John Stape had abducted her. Kevin threatens John but is restrained by a detective.\n\nIn 2009, Kevin becomes attracted to Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), wife of his business partner and best friend, Tyrone. Molly begins to help Sally with the book-keeping and spends more time with Kevin. Eventually, he tells Molly that he has feelings for her but she is initially horrified and slaps Kevin but later admits that she is flattered. They begin an affair, first sleeping together when Kevin sneaks away from Sally's birthday party in July 2009. Afterwards, Kevin feels guilty and decides to end the fling by persuading Tyrone to take Molly on holiday but it resumes in August. They soon admit that they love each other and plan to start a new life together. However, Kevin keeps finding reasons not to tell Sally, including Sophie's baptism and her GCSEs. On Christmas Day, Kevin and Molly agree that they will tell their respective partners then but Sally drops a bombshell of her own - she has breast cancer. Kevin makes it to Molly's house before she tells Tyrone, telling her that Sally has cancer and that he intends to support her, ending their relationship. However, he has to talk to Molly as she discovers that she is four months pregnant and isn't sure who the father is. Kevin, however, refuses to have anything to do with her and suggests she have a termination but Tyrone is thrilled and convinces Molly to let him look after her. Hurt by Kevin's behaviour, Molly agrees.\n\nIn August 2010 at Roy and Hayley's wedding, Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) tells the Street that she caught Sophie and her best friend, Sian Powers (Sacha Parkinson), kissing a few days before but Kevin and Sally don't believe her. Sophie admits the truth to her shocked father that night, that she and Sian are in love. Kevin is supportive but the girls decide to run away together, much to Kevin and Sally's devastation. They are later reunited with her after Rosie tracks her down to Sheffield and brings them home. On 6 December, Kevin is knocked down by the explosion in the Joinery and derails a tram that smashes into the corner shop, crushing Molly, who is inside with baby Jack and Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati). He and Tyrone try to free Molly but they are pulled away by the emergency services. Sally sits with Molly to comfort her as she is dying and she tells Sally that Kevin is baby Jack's father. Sally is devastated and Kevin admits it so she throws him out and he returns to the hospital to see how Jack is doing. When Jack is discharged, Tyrone asks for Kevin and Sally for help to look after him. However, Sally goes out, unable to face Jack but Kevin finds her and tries to convince her that he still loves her. Sally tells him that she wants him to leave for good. Later, in the Rovers, he meets Bill and Pam. Pam expresses her grief at Molly's death and makes it clear she blames Kevin as she does not know how to tell Molly's father, Diggory Compton (Eric Potts). The funeral is arranged for 17 December 2010 and during the service, Tyrone breaks down while giving his eulogy and Kevin takes over but Sally leaves the church, disgusted. Unfortunately, this and seeing Kevin and Sally argue arouses Tyrone's suspicions. At the graveside, Tyrone realises that Kevin is Jack's father and attacks him at the graveside, making him fall into the grave on top of Molly's coffin. Later, Sally, Rosie, and Sophie insist that Kevin leave, despite his pleas for forgiveness. Kevin spends the night in the garage and goes home the next day, barging in and refuses to leave until Sally threatens to call the police and have him arrested. Sophie begs her not to and Sally agrees to let Kevin stay that night, providing that he stay away from her. The next day, Tyrone gives baby Jack to Kevin, much to Sally and Rosie's disgust and Rosie moves out. On Christmas Eve, Sally tells Kevin that watching him with Jack makes her hate him even more and she wants them out. He asks Tyrone to take Jack back but he refuses so Kevin moves out, but after a desperate plea from Sophie, Sally allows Kevin to stay for Christmas Day.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Kevin accepts the fact that Jack is his son and that his family doesn't want him around. He leaves Coronation Street, returning a week later only to find Tyrone leaving his house and confronts him. Sally tells Kevin that her life is no longer his business, making Kevin and Tyrone fight. Kevin tells Sally that he is filing for divorce and is putting the house on the market. Kevin and Sally agree a truce but when Kevin suggests they reconcile and raise Jack together, Sally refuses and this leads to a feud between them as he shows buyers around the house but Sally and neighbour, Eddie Windass (Steve Huison) put them off. That week, Rosie tells Kevin that she wants to get to know Jack better and offers to babysit but actually uses him for a modelling audition but brings the wrong baby home, angering Kevin. He returns the other child and collects Jack from the studio, telling Rosie to stay away and ignores her until her boss, Alfie, Sally's new boyfriend, Jeff Cullen (Steven Houghton), fires her. Kevin supports her and offers to punch Alfie but the arguing upsets Sophie so she gets drunk and believing that her life is falling apart, falls off the church roof. Sally blames Kevin and they argue again until Sian interrupts, telling them that they are both responsible for Sophie's accident. Although unhappy at what Sian has said, they accept this and call a truce. Sally invites him to the house for the evening and allows Kevin to hug her but he gets the wrong impression and tries to kiss her so she asks him to leave.\n\nOn the day that Kevin and Sally meet to finalise their divorce, Kevin wins £200,000 on a scratch card but keeps it secret. Tyrone, however, tells Sally just as she is about to sign. On hearing this, Sally refuses to sign and demands £100,000. The following week, Sally receives some flowers from Kevin and he also buys Sally a new car but she sells it and keeps the money before getting the lottery money frozen until a court hearing can be arranged. However, the judge rules in Kevin's favour as Sally loses her temper when Kevin's lawyer reminds her of her affair with Ian Davenport but he later gives the entire £200,000 to Sally, after Bill encourages him to do whatever is necessary to win Sally back. After talking to Gail, she returns half of the winnings to him for Jack and they call a truce. When Jeff reveals he is taking Sally to Paris for a fortnight and gloats in front of Kevin, Sally apologises for Jeff's attitude and they remember their wedding anniversary trip to Paris five years before. Kevin bids Sally farewell and they part on good terms.\n\nIn May 2011, Kevin and Tyrone's feuding at the garage turns violent after Tyrone, in a fit of rage, damages a new hydraulic lift that Kevin has bought. Kevin is crushed under a car he is working on when it gives way and is saved by Tyrone and Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain). When Tyrone admits he damaged the lift, Kevin forgives him and they call a truce so they can work together. Sally returns from Paris that day and aks Kevin and Jack to stay with her until his injuries heal and he agrees. One day in June, he isn't happy to see Sophie and Sian giving money to Ken Barlow's (William Roache) grandson, James Cunningham (James Roache), when the soup kitchen is reportedly burgled. He bans them from the kitchen and is surprised when Sally backs him up but Sophie ignores them and starts working there as a manager. Kevin softens and supports the charity auction held at the bistro. The following day, Kevin gets the all-clear about his collarbone and is shocked when Sophie asks him to loan her £20,000 so the charity can buy the house they've been renting. After Kevin refuses, Sophie hacks into his bank account and transfers £20,000 to the charity. Meanwhile, Sally and Kevin's relationship is improving as Sally doesn't ask Kevin to return to his flat and they have stopped arguing. However, the next day, Sophie and Sian are horrified to learn that the charity never bid for the house and that the soup kitchen is being demolished, with builders insisting it hasn't been occupied for months. Failing to find the charity leaders, Rob and Janet, Sophie and Sian realise that they've lost £20,000. Forced to confess, she tells Kevin, who angrily confronts James, who insists he knows nothing about the scam and is supported by the Barlow family, except Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who has suspicions. Kevin calls the police but tells them that he transferred the cash, ending the tension in the Webster home. A few days later, Kevin learns that the two con artists behind the charity scam have been arrested and tells Sally. James panics, realising that the truth will come out; he attacks Ken and flees Weatherfield. Ken tells the Websters what has happened and Kevin tells the police. In September, Kevin learns that Tyrone has a new girlfriend, Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede), a police officer he met in a bar. Tommy admits to Kevin he paid Kirsty to flirt with Tyrone and Kevin insists Tommy tell Tyrone the truth.\n\nDuring September, Kevin learns that his sister Debbie has bought a villa in Turkey and plans to take Jack there. However, he learns that to change Jack's birth certificate, he'll have to apply for parental responsibility. Ken, who has experience of adoption, warns him that he should discuss it with Tyrone. Tyrone angrily tells Kevin to do whatever he wants. The next day, Bill and Pam visit Kevin and tell him that they are engaged but Pam is appalled to learn that Kevin is still living with Sally and plans to change Jack's surname. This prompts Sally, to ask Kevin to leave and he reluctantly agrees. Kevin and Pam argue and she bans him from the wedding whilst he bans her from seeing Jack. Bill collapses, suffering a heart attack, and is taken to hospital, but the arguing continues until Sally stops them. Sally ends the relationship the next day after she hears Kevin telling Sophie that they are back together. Wanting to prove Kevin wrong, she resumes her relationship with Jeff, much to Rosie and Sophie's disgust. Over the coming weeks, Kevin accepts Sally has moved on and decides to stop trying to win her back and in October, they are back on good terms as proved when Sophie announces she and Sian are engaged. Kevin refuses to give his permission for their marriage and Sally agrees, but next day, Kevin and Rosie's boyfriend Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) are concerned when Rosie goes missing again after viewing a flat and learn that it is next to \"The Kabin\". They kick the door down and find Rosie tied up, John having kidnapped her again because he is coaching her to be a witness for Fiz at her trial. John escapes but Kevin goes after him, leaving Jason to look after Rosie. As he tells a horrified Sally, John races past them in his car and Kevin chases him, resulting in a car chase that ends when John crashes his car into a truck trailer. The next day, as Rosie gives her statement, she thanks her dad for rescuing her and Kevin is the hero of the Webster family. When John dies, Kevin has to stop Sally from going to see Fiz being sentenced, because she belittles Fiz's friends and family for supporting a murderer. He defends her in The Rovers when Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) attacks Sally for her comments. Later in the week, Sophie celebrates her 17th birthday. However, this is overshadowed when Kevin reads an article in the \"Gazette\" about Rosie's second kidnapping, as well as insensitive comments about Sally's cancer, Kevin's affair, baby Jack and about Sophie's sexuality. Kevin and Sally are furious with Rosie, and they throw Jeff out when they learn he convinced Rosie to write the article. Sophie's birthday is celebrated by Kevin with a firework display. In personal terms, Kev and Sal are on good terms again.\n\nTowards the end of 2011, Sophie and Sian announce their intention to have a civil partnership. Kevin and Sally come round to the idea and a date is set for late December. However, Kevin learns from Sunita that Sophie has been having doubts, and he tries unsuccessfully to talk her out of it. Later, during the ceremony, Kevin feels his fears are well-founded when Sophie stumbles through her vows and tells her that she didn't have to go through with it, causing a massive row between Sophie and Sian; the ceremony is abandoned. That evening Sian leaves Sophie for good and Kevin is guilt-stricken over his part in the break-up. Sophie tells him that she will never speak to him again. Sally and Rosie are sympathetic, knowing Kevin didn't do it out of spite. Soon Kevin learns that Sally is dating Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel), who is awaiting trial for raping Carla Connor (Alison King). Kevin had doubts about Frank's past and wanting the truth from Sally, he is forced to tell Sophie but Sally accuses Kevin of trying to interfere in their relationship and retaliates by telling him that she will file for divorce the next day. Sophie rejects him again when she asks Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie) to fix a leak in the kitchen - stating that she would \"much rather drown than speak to my dad again\", though Rita suggests Kevin give it time and Sophie will realise that she was wrong but she adopts Frank as father figure, to Kevin's growing disgust. However, he did achieve one good thing: he started repairing his friendship with Tyrone as Kirsty had just learned that she was pregnant and Tyrone wasn't sure if he wanted to be with her. Upon learning on Kirsty's pregnancy, Kevin congratulated Tyrone and the two shook hands. This persuaded Tyrone to stay with her and started Kevin and Tyrone's healing relationship.\n\nAfter Frank was cleared of raping Carla, he made plans for Underworld's future and cheated on Sally with business associate, Jenny Sumner (Niky Wardley). When Sally confronted him, Frank admitted raping Carla and threatened Sally. This infuriated Kevin, who vowed to kill Frank. When Sally finds Frank dead and becomes a suspect, Frank's mother, Anne (Gwen Taylor), is revealed to be responsible. Horrified, Sally tries to escape but trips, hits her head and is knocked unconscious. She is rushed to hospital following a tense standoff between Anne, Kevin, and Carla. At the hospital, whilst waiting for Sally to emerge from her coma, Sophie thanks Kevin for stopping the civil partnership. A few days later, Sally returns from hospital and admits she is grateful to Kevin. In February 2013, Kevin helps Tyrone escape with his daughter behind Kirsty Soames' back. Kevin is later questioned by the police. In late March, Sally tells the neighbours that Kevin has had to leave because his father is ill and Pam cannot cope on her own.\n\nOn Monday 17 March, Sally announces that Bill has recovered and that Kevin will be returning later in the week, with his son Jack. The following day, he phones his house tenants Stella Price (Michelle Collins), Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Eva moves out to live with her boyfriend Jason, leaving a spare bedroom for Kevin and Jack. Kevin arrives in a taxi, while Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) invites him into \"The Kabin\" for a cup of tea and a chat. When Kevin and Jack are inside Rita's flat, Sophie's friend Maddie Heath (Amy James-Kelly) steals one of their bags with their iPod, camera and Jack's clothes inside. Kevin later spots a man in Sally's house, who turns out to be her boyfriend Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine). Mistaking Tim for a burglar, Kevin attacks him, but Sally turns up and reveals who he is. Kevin later goes to visit Tyrone who invites him and Jack to stay at his house until Stella and Leanne find somewhere else. Kevin then returns to work full-time at the garage.\n\nIn 2015, Kevin embarks on a romantic relationship with an old friend Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews). They go on a few dates and Kevin invites her back to his for a nightcap but Jenny is reluctant to return to Coronation Street for fear of seeing her former foster mother, Rita. Jenny eventually returns to the Street. Rita struggles to forgive Jenny but they begin to get along. Eventually, Jenny moves into Kevin's house and the pair engage in a serious relationship. Kevin's daughter, Sophie, disapproves of the relationship and suspects Jenny of plotting something. Jenny starts to bond with Kevin's son Jack. In May 2015, it is discovered that Jenny previously had a son, who died when he drowned in a paddling pool; Jenny blames herself for the accident. Jenny plans to leave Kevin, taking Jack with her. She calls for a taxi and puts on a wig, using the name of \"Melanie Davies\", arranging to rent a flat in Hull. Jenny is discovered by Sophie's girlfriend, Maddie, but leaves for Hull with Jack. When Kevin and Sophie realise that Jack is missing, they travel to Hull, with Rita, to find Jenny is on the balcony with Jack. Rita talks Jenny down and she is taken away by the police and sectioned.\n\nIn August 2015, Kevin decides to expand his garage business. Kevin's ex-wife, Sally is impressed with his entrepreneurial spirit and encourages him. When the factory where Sally works comes up for sale, she persuades Kevin to help her buy it. Kevin and Sally later kiss, but Sally is engaged to Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine), and they agree to keep it between them. Kevin and Sally's daughter, Sophie, senses an atmosphere, and Sally eventually confesses that she kissed Kevin but says it was a mistake. Sally's next-door neighbour, Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) overhears Sally and Sophie discussing the matter. A few weeks later, when Anna is drunk at The Rovers Return Inn, she tells Tim that Kevin and Sally recently kissed. As a result, Sally and Tim split up, putting Kevin and Tim's friendship in jeopardy. Kevin and Tim are reconciled but Tim at first refuses to forgive Sally; they eventually marry. A few months later, Kevin is devastated to learn that his best mate Tyrone's step-daughter has cancer. He tries his best to support Tyrone and says he can take as much time off as he needs. Kevin also decides to give his daughter Sophie 21% of his new business for her 21st birthday.\n\nKevin meets a woman called Joanne (Martha Cope) on a singles night and they start dating. However, Kevin has doubts about her and it soon becomes clear that he has feelings for Anna and the pair kiss. Anna then helps Kevin separate from Joanne by pretending to get pregnant by him. Kevin and Anna start dating but agree to wait before going public. Tim sees them together in the back of a taxi, and Sally and Sophie soon find out. Kevin gets a job with Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre), but Anna is unhappy as Phelan had previously blackmailed her into sleeping with him. Anna warns Kevin, but Phelan lies to him. Anna refuses to let Phelan affect their relationship. After she smashes Phelan's van Kevin breaks up with her but catches Phelan threatening her. She tells him about how Phelan blackmailed her. Anna and Kevin go out for tea and meet Phelan and his new girlfriend Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver). Kevin tricks Phelan by ordering a bottle of wine.\n\nOn 16 May 2016, Tim goes to Blackpool with Kevin and Jack. Sally and Sophie follow and see Tim and Kevin through a café window. Sally confronts them while Jack disappears. Jenny, who is also in Blackpool, sees Jack and runs after him. Kevin sees Jack run out in front of a tram, but Jenny pushes him out of the way just in time. Although Sally and Sophie make accusations, Kevin thanks Jenny for saving Jack's life. In October 2016, Kevin and Anna decide to move in together. However, after helping in freeing Gary and Lily Platt from under David's crashed car, Anna is engulfed in flames when a fireball from the car strikes her. Kevin and Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) are able to extinguish the flames before Anna is taken to hospital. Later, when Anna is made homeless, she moves in with Kevin. In early June 2018, Anna leaves Weatherfield after she stabbed enemy Pat Phelan in the viaduct bistro, leaving him to die. This leaves Kevin heart-broken but he soon gets over it. Later that month, Rosie leaves claiming she needs to find herself. In the following month, when Sophie is looking after Jack, he falls over and hurts his knee. Sophie takes him home but thinks nothing of it. Then, he starts to claim it is in pain and they soon come to discover that his leg needs to be amputated. Kevin is shocked by this news and struggles to come to terms with the fact that his son will now only have one leg. As Sophie feels guilty for not realising that Jack wasn’t well, she tries to help by finding a way to get Jack his treatment in Liverpool, Kevin finds it all too sudden and rejects her attempts. Over the next couple of months, Kevin starts to struggle as he has to support Jack.\n\nActor Michael Le Vell auditioned for the role and landed the part after he had played another character called Neil Grimshaw, a newspaper delivery boy who worked at The Kabin.\nKevin is very much a family man and looks out for them. ITV publicity say of the character: \"A no-nonsense garage mechanic who likes an uncomplicated life and his tea on the table when he comes home from work.\". In the book 'Life in The Street' by Graeme Kay, Kevin is described as a very cheerful yet cautious character.\n\nKevin is the son of Bill (Peter Armitage) and Alison Webster. Kevin's mother died of cancer when he was just 15 years old and this experience traumatised him. He first appears in 1983, as an apprentice mechanic working for Brian Tilsley (Chris Quinten). His father Bill and his younger sister, Debbie (Sue Devaney), later join him. Initially his life consists of working by day and drinking with friends Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro) and Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) in the evening. He dates Mandie Whitworth, a friend of Terry's girlfriend and Michelle Robinson and meets his long term love interest, Sally Seddon (Sally Dynevor), in 1986 and they later marry. The Websters buy Number 13 from Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) after she leaves to work as a doctor's housekeeper.\n\nThe characters of Kevin and Sally had a lack of storylines in their first years on the show but received a boost when Brian Park became executive producer. The Independent reports him as saying \"Kevin and Sally Webster had years of washing their hands and eating baked beans on toast. Michael Le Vell and Sally Dynevor (then Whittaker) were then given great storylines, including his affair with Natalie, Sally's catfight with her when she found out and the subsequent divorce\".\n\nKevin spends his early years in the show with Sally Seddon. They marry and have two daughters, Rosie (Helen Flanagan) and Sophie (Brooke Vincent).\nWhile Sally is away nursing her sick mother, Kevin has an affair with Natalie Horrocks (Denise Welch) mother of his business partner. Natalie has no compunction about seducing a married man. Sally angrily confronts Natalie when she learns of the affair. Kevin and Sally divorce, due to the affair, and Kevin moves in with Natalie. However, he is unhappy and ends the relationship to return to Sally.\n\nSally and Kevin reconcile, partly for the girls' sake. However, Sally is seduced by Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington). Kevin throws her out when he learns of the affair. Greg uses Sally's money (inherited from her mother) and abuses her. The affair ends but Kevin refuses to take her back, marrying Alison Wakefield (Naomi Radcliffe) instead. The night before the wedding, Kevin and Sally sleep together for old times' sake. This secret assignation comes out, on the day Sally is to marry Danny Hargreaves (Richard Standing). Danny calls their wedding off, angry that she had cheated on him and then lied about it.\n\nKevin's marriage to Alison is fraught. It is learned she had a traumatic childhood after her sibling drowned and Alison is suspected of intentionally killing her. When Alison is late returning Rosie and Sophie after an outing, Sally and Kevin, perhaps believing Alison really did murder her sibling, fear that Alison might have harmed them. Alison and the girls soon return - Alison had actually taken the girls to a photographer for portraits as a gift to Kevin. Alison is traumatised when she learns Kevin and Sally feared she might have harmed the girls. Alison later commits suicide after the death of her newborn son.\n\nKevin asks Sally to marry him again and she agrees, for the sake of their daughters. Sally has another affair with new boss, Ian Davenport (Philip Bretherton), in 2005. Kevin overlooks it, pretending to believe Sally's denial. In 2009, Kevin develops an attraction to Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), wife of his business partner and friend Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) and has an affair with her lasting until Christmas 2009.\n\nIn February 2013, Michael Le Vell was accused of sexual assault allegations and Kevin was written out of the series with the explanation that he was in Germany taking care of his father Bill Webster to explain his absence. Le Vell was found not guilty in September of the same year, and entered talks to return. Kevin returned briefly in March 2014, 13 months since his last appearance, before taking another temporary break from the show after it was revealed that Le Vell had taken cocaine during his absence.\n\nLe Vell was nominated in the category of \"Best Actor\" at the 2011 British Soap Awards.\n\n"}
