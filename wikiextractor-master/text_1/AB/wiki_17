The airline ceased all operations in 2007.\n\nOrex was formerly the Turkish cargo agent of the Dutch airfreight company Schreiner Airways. It was established in the beginning of 2003 with headquarters in Florya, Istanbul, and started operations in April the same year. The cargo service, initially on charter basis, was carried out with a 45-ton payload capacity Airbus A300F-200 freighter aircraft between Istanbul and Gatwick, London, United Kingdom via Brussels, Belgium. At the end of 2003, a second A300F was put into operation. The company started cargo service between Brussels and Shanghai Pudong, China via Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Orex became so Turkey's first ever cargo carrier operating a national link to the Far East. The frequency of scheduled cargo operations increased from weekly three to five days a week between Istanbul and Gatwick via Brussels.\n\nIn March 2004, a 105-ton payload capacity Boeing 747F-200 freighter jumbo jet joined the fleet servicing between Shanghai and Brussels via Istanbul. It became the biggest aircraft in operation ever in the history of Turkish civil aviation. The aircraft was flown by foreign pilots with special permit of the Turkish government since no Turkish pilot certified to operate a B747 was available.\n\nCargo operations were extended to destinations including Almaty in Kazakhstan, Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Nanjing and Jiangsu in China.\n\nIn addition to its core business of carrying freight, Orex also went into the business of passenger flights on charter basis including touristic trips and occasionally in the Middle East for Hajj, Umrah.\n\nThe airline ceased all operations in 2007.\n\nIn February 2004, Orex carried in-sheets-printed -banknotes from Zürich, Switzerland to Athens, Greece, where they were cut by Laser and flown back to Zürich.\n\nIn March 2004, Orex became the first ever cargo airline carrying humanitarian aid during the intervention of an international peacekeeping force in Haiti after the 2004 coup d'état, which followed political unrest and rebellions. On behalf of the United Nations, 25-ton of food, medicine and two ambulances were flown from Geneva, Switzerland to Haiti via Shannon, Ireland and Gander, Canada. As the rebels did not permit the freighter aircraft A300F to land at the destination airport in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, it was diverted to an airport near Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe fleet of Orex consisted of the following aircraft:\n\n"}

Bob does not want the proxy to be able to read the contents of his messages. \nBob could designate a proxy to re-encrypt one of his messages that is to be sent to Charlie. This generates a new key that Charlie can use to decrypt the message. Now if Bob sends Charlie a message that was encrypted under Bob's key, the proxy will alter the message, allowing Charlie to decrypt it. This method allows for a number of applications such as e-mail forwarding, law-enforcement monitoring, and content distribution.\n\nA weaker re-encryption scheme is one in which the proxy possesses both parties' keys simultaneously. One key decrypts a plaintext, while the other encrypts it. Since the goal of many proxy re-encryption schemes is to avoid revealing either of the keys or the underlying plaintext to the proxy, this method is not ideal.\n\nProxy re-encryption schemes are similar to traditional symmetric or asymmetric encryption schemes, with the addition of two functions:\n\nProxy re-encryption should not be confused with proxy signatures, which is a separate construction with a different purpose.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1935842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935842", "title": "Evidence-based design", "text": "Evidence-based design\n\nEvidence-based design (EBD) is the process of constructing a building or physical environment based on scientific research to achieve the best possible outcomes. Evidence-based design is especially important in evidence-based medicine, where research has shown that environment design can affect patient outcomes. It is also used in architecture, interior design, landscape design, facilities management, education, and city planning. Evidence-based design is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices.\n\nEvidence-based design (EBD) was popularized by the seminal study by Ulrich (1984) that showed the impact of a window view on patient recovery. Studies have since examined the relationships between design of the physical environment of hospitals with outcomes in health, the results of which show how the physical environment can lower the incidence of nosocomial infections, medical errors, patient falls, and staff injuries; and reduce stress of facility users, improve safety and productivity, reduce resource waste, and enhance sustainability.\n\n\"Evidence\" in EBD may include a wide range of sources of knowledge, from systematic literature reviews to practice guidelines and expert opinions. Evidence-based design was first defined as \"the deliberate attempt to base design decisions on the best available research evidence\" and that \"an evidence-based designer, together with an informed client, makes decisions based on the best available information from research and project evaluations\". The Center for Heath Design (CHD), a non-profit organization that supports healthcare and design professionals to improve the understanding and application of design that influence the performance of healthcare, patient satisfaction, staff productivity and safety, base their model on the importance of working in partnership with the client and interdisciplinary team to foster understanding of the client, preferences and resources.\n\nThe roots of evidence-based design could go back to 1860 when Florence Nightingale identified fresh air as \"the very first canon of nursing,\" and emphasized the importance of quiet, proper lighting, warmth and clean water. Nightingale applied statistics to nursing, notably with \"Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East\". This statistical study led to advances in sanitation, although the germ theory of disease was not yet fully accepted. The evidence-based design movement began much later in the 1970s with Archie Cochranes's book \"Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services\". to collect, codify, and disseminate \"evidence\" gathered in randomised controlled trials relative to the built environment. A 1984 study by Roger Ulrich found that surgical patients with a view of nature suffered fewer complications, used less pain medication and were discharged sooner than those who looked out on a brick wall; and laid the foundation for what has now become a discipline known as evidence-based design. Studies exist about the psychological effects of lighting, carpeting and noise on critical-care patients, and evidence links physical environment with improvement of patients and staff safety, wellness and satisfaction. Architectural researchers have studied the impact of hospital layout on staff effectiveness, and social scientists studied guidance and wayfinding. Architectural researchers have conducted post-occupancy evaluations (POE) to provide advice on improving building design and quality. While the EBD process is particularly suited to healthcare, it may be also used in other fields for positive health outcomes and provision of healing environments.\n\nThere is a growing awareness among healthcare professionals and medical planners for the need to create patient-centered environments that can help patients and family cope with the stress that accompanies illness. There is also growing supporting research and evidence through various studies; that have shown both the influence of well designed environments on positive patient health outcomes, and poor design on negative effects including longer hospital stays.\n\nNumerous studies have demonstrated improved patient health outcomes through environmental measures; exposing patients to nature has been shown to produce substantial alleviation of pain, and limited research also suggests that patients experience less pain when exposed to higher levels of daylight in their hospital rooms. Patients have an increased need for sleep during illness, but suffer from poor sleep when hospitalised. Approaches such as single-bed rooms and reduced noise have been shown to improve patient sleep. Natural daylight in patient rooms help to maintain circadian rhythms and improve sleep.\n\nAccording to Heerwagen, an environmental psychologist, medical models of health integrate behavioral, social, psychological, and mental processes. Contact with nature and daylight has been found to enhance emotional functioning; drawing on research from studies (EBD) on well-being outcomes and building features. Positive feelings such as calmness increase, while anxiety, anger, or other negative emotions diminish with views of nature. In contrast there is also convincing evidence that stress could be worsened and ineffective in fostering restoration in built environments that lack nature. Few studies have shown the restorative effects of gardens for stressed patients, families and staff. Behavioural observation and interview methods in post occupancy studies of hospital gardens have shown a faster recovery from stress by nearly all garden users. Limited evidence suggest increased benefits when these gardens contain foliage, flowers, water, pleasant nature sounds, such as birds and water.\n\nEBD is closely related to performance-based building design (PBBD) practices. As an approach to design, PBBD tries to create clear statistical relationships between design decisions and satisfaction levels demonstrated by the building systems. Like EBD, PBBD uses research evidence to predict performance related to design decisions.\n\nThe decision-making process is non-linear, since the building environment is a complex system. Choices cannot be based on cause-and-effect predictions; instead, they depend on variable components and mutual relationships. Technical systems, such as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, have interrelated design choices and related performance requirements (such as energy use, comfort and use cycles) are variable components.\n\nEvidence-based medicine (EBM) is a systematic process of evaluating scientific research which is used as the basis for clinical treatment choices. Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes and Richardson argue that \"evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients\". It is used in the healthcare industry to convince decision-makers to invest the time and money to build better buildings, realizing strategic business advantages as a result. As medicine has become increasingly evidence-based, healthcare design uses EBD to link hospitals' physical environments with healthcare outcomes.\n\nResearch-informed design (RID) is a less developed concept that is commonly misunderstood and used synonymously with EBD, although they are different. It can be defined as the process of applying credible research in integration with the project team to inform the environmental design to achieve the project goals. Credible research here, includes qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches with the highest standards of rigor suitable for their methodology.\nIt is important to understand that the literature for \"research-informed\" practices comes from education and not from the healthcare disciplines. The process involves application of the outcomes from literature review and empirical investigation to inform design during the design phase, given the constraints; and to share the process and the lessons learnt just like in EDB.\n\nAs EBD is supported by research, many healthcare organizations are adopting its principles with the guidance of evidence-based designers. The Center for Health Design and InformeDesign (a not-for-profit clearinghouse for design and human-behaviour research) have developed the Pebble Project, a joint research effort by CHD and selected healthcare providers on the effect of building environments on patients and staff. Health Environment Research and Design journal (HERD), and the Health Care Advisory Board are additional sources of information and database on EBD.\n\nThe Evidence Based Design Accreditation and Certification (EDAC) program was introduced in 2009 by the Center for Health Design to provide internationally recognized accreditation and promote the use of EBD in healthcare building projects, making EBD an accepted and credible approach to improving healthcare outcomes. The EDAC identifies those experienced in EBD and teaches about the research process: identifying, hypothesizing, implementing, gathering and reporting data associated with a healthcare project.\n\nThere are four components to evidence-based design:\n\nIn his book \"Evidence-based Policy: A Realistic Perspective\", Ray Pawson suggests a meta-analysis template which may be applied to EBD. With this protocol, the field will be able to provide designers with a source for evidence-based design.\n\nA systematic review process should follow five steps:\n\nAccording to Hamilton, architects have a responsibility in translation of research in the field, and its application in informing designs. He further illustrates a conceptual model architects could use, that identifies four levels of addressing research and methods base on varying levels of commitment: \n\nA white paper (series 3/5) from the Center for Health Design presents a working model to help designers implement EBD decision-making. The primary goal is providing a healing environment; positive outcomes depend on three investments:\n\nAll three investments depend on existing research.\n\nA white paper from the Center for Health Design identifies ten strategies to aid EBD decision-making:\n\nEvidence-based design has been applied to efficacy measurements of a building's design, and is usually done at the post-construction stage as a part of a post-occupancy evaluation (POE). The POE assesses strengths and weaknesses of design decisions in relation to human behaviour in a built environment. Issues include acoustics, odor control, vibration, lighting and user-friendliness, and are binary-choice (acceptable or unacceptable). Other research techniques, such as observation, photography, checklists, interviews, surveys and focus groups, supplement traditional design-research methods.\nAssessment tools have been developed by The Center for Health Design and the Picker Institute to help healthcare managers and designers gather information on consumer needs, assess their satisfaction and measure quality improvements:\n\n\n\n"}

William paid the Danes to go home, but the remaining rebels refused to meet him in battle, and he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires using scorched earth tactics, especially in the city of York, before relieving the English aristocracy of their positions, and installing Norman aristocrats throughout the region.\n\nContemporary chronicles vividly record the savagery of the campaign, the huge scale of the destruction and the widespread famine caused by looting, burning and slaughtering. Some present-day scholars have labelled the campaigns a genocide, although others doubt whether William could have assembled enough troops to inflict so much damage and have suggested that the records may have been exaggerated or misinterpreted. Records from the Domesday Book show that 75% of the population died or never returned. \n\nAt the time of the Norman Conquest \"the North\" consisted of what became Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumberland in the east and Lancashire with the southern parts of Cumberland and Westmorland in the west. The population of the north pre-conquest can be described as \"Anglo-Scandinavian\" carrying a cultural continuity from a mixing of Viking and Anglo-Saxon traditions. The dialect of English spoken in Yorkshire may well have been unintelligible to people from the south of England, and the aristocracy was primarily Danish in origin.\n\nFurther, communications between the north and south were difficult, partly due to the terrain but also because of the poor state of the roads. The more popular route between York and the south was by ship. In 962 Edgar the Peaceful had granted legal autonomy to the northern earls of the Danelaw in return for their loyalty; this had limited the powers of the Anglo-Saxon kings who succeeded him north of the Humber. The earldom of Northumbria stretched from the Tees to the Tweed.\n\nAfter the defeat of the English army and death of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, English resistance to the conquest was centred on Edgar Ætheling, the grandson of Edmund Ironside. Ironside was half-brother to Edward the Confessor. It is said the English conceded defeat, not at Hastings, but at Berkhamsted two months later when Edgar and his supporters submitted to William in December 1066. However, of all the men who submitted to William at Berkhamsted it was only Ealdred, Bishop of York, who would remain loyal to the Norman king. William faced a series of rebellions and border skirmishes in Dover, Exeter, Hereford, Nottingham, Durham, York and Peterborough.\n\nCopsi, a supporter of Tostig (a previous Anglo-Saxon earl of Northumbria who had been banished by Edward the Confessor), was a native of Northumbria and his family had a history of being rulers of Bernicia, and at times Northumbria. Copsi had fought in Harald Hardrada's army with Tostig, against Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. He had managed to escape after Harald's defeat. When Copsi offered homage to William at Barking in 1067, William rewarded him by making him earl of Northumbria. After just five weeks as earl, Copsi was murdered by Osulf, son of Earl Eadulf III of Bernicia. When, in turn, the usurping Osulf was also killed, his cousin, Cospatrick, bought the earldom from William. He was not long in power before he joined Edgar Ætheling in rebellion against William in 1068.\n\nWith two earls murdered and one changing sides, William decided to intervene personally in Northumbria. He marched north and arrived in York during the summer of 1068. The opposition melted away, with some of them – including Edgar – taking refuge at the court of the Scottish king Malcolm III.\n\nBack in Northumbria, William changed tack and appointed a Norman, Robert de Comines, as earl, rather than an Anglo-Saxon. Despite warnings from the bishop, Ethelwin, that a rebel army was mobilised against him, Robert rode into Durham with a party of men on 28 January 1069, where he and his men were surrounded and slaughtered. The rebels then turned their attention to York where they killed the guardian of the castle there plus a large number of his men. William's response was swift and brutal: he returned to York, where he fell on the besiegers, killing or putting them to flight.\n\nPossibly emboldened by the fighting in the north, rebellions broke out in other parts of the country. William sent earls to deal with problems in Dorset, Shrewsbury and Devon, while he dealt with rebels in the Midlands and Stafford.\n\nEdgar Ætheling had sought assistance from the king of Denmark, Sweyn II, a nephew of King Canute. Sweyn assembled a fleet of ships under the command of his sons. The fleet sailed up the east coast of England raiding as they went. The Danes with their English allies retook the city of York. Then, in the winter of 1069, William marched his army from Nottingham to York with the intention of engaging the rebel army. However, by the time William's army had reached York, the rebel army had fled, with Edgar returning to Scotland. As they had nowhere suitable on land to stay for the winter, the Danes decided to go back to their ships in the Humber Estuary. After negotiation with William, it was agreed that, if he made payment to them, then they would go home to Denmark without a fight. With the Danes having returned home, William then turned to the rebels. As they were not prepared to meet his army in pitched battle, he employed a strategy that would attack the rebel army's sources of support and their food supply.\n\nWilliam's strategy, implemented during the winter of 1069–70 (he spent Christmas 1069 in York), has been described by William E. Kapelle and some other modern scholars as an act of genocide. Contemporary biographers of William considered it to be his cruellest act and a \"stain upon his soul\". Writing about the Harrying of the North, over fifty years later, the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote (summarized):\n\nThe land was ravaged on either side of William's route north from the River Aire. His army destroyed crops and settlements and forced rebels into hiding. In the New Year of 1070 he split his army into smaller units and sent them out to burn, loot, and terrify. Florence of Worcester said that from the Humber to the Tees, William's men burnt whole villages and slaughtered the inhabitants. Food stores and livestock were destroyed so that anyone surviving the initial massacre would succumb to starvation over the winter. The survivors were reduced to cannibalism. Refugees from the harrying are mentioned as far away as Worcestershire in the Evesham Abbey chronicle.\n\nIn 1086, Yorkshire and the North Riding still had large areas of waste territory. The Domesday Book entries indicate \"wasteas est\" or \"hoc est vast\" (\"it is wasted\") for estate after estate; in all a total of 60% of all holdings were waste. It states that 66% of all villages contained wasted manors. Even the prosperous areas of the county had lost 60% of its value compared to 1066. Only 25% of the population and plough teams remained with a reported loss of 80,000 oxen and 150,000 people.\n\nIndependent archaeological evidence supports the massive destruction and displacement of people. The archaeologist Richard Ernest Muir wrote that there was evidence for the \"violent disruption [that] took place in Yorkshire in 1069–71, in the form of hoards of coins which were buried by the inhabitants.\" B.K. Roberts in his book \"The Making of the English Village\", suggests the reason that large numbers of villages have been laid out in regular pattern in Durham and Yorkshire, was through a restructuring at a single point in time, as opposed to natural settlement growth. He goes on to say that it is highly unlikely that such plans could have resulted from piecemeal additions and must have been necessary after the Harrying of the North. The dating is thought to be secure as it is known that Norman lords used similar regular plans in founding new towns in the 'plantation' of rural settlements in other conquered parts of the British Isles.\n\nHowever, although the Domesday Book records large numbers of manors in the north as waste, some historians have posited it was not possible for William's relatively small army to be responsible for such wide-scale devastation imputed to him, so perhaps raiding Danes or Scots may have contributed to some of the destruction. It has been variously argued that \"waste\" signified manorial re-organisation, some form of tax break, or merely a confession of ignorance by the Domesday commissioners when unable to determine details of population and other manorial resources.\n\nAccording to Paul Dalton, it was questionable whether the Conqueror had the time, manpower or good weather necessary to reduce the north to a desert. It was evident, from the chroniclers, that William did harry the north but as the bulk of William's troops, Dalton suggests, were guarding castles in southern England and Wales, and as William was only in the north for a maximum of three months, the amount of damage he could do was limited.\n\nMark Hagger suggests that in the words of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", William's Harrying of the North was \"stern beyond measure\" but should not be described as genocide as William was acting by the rules of his own time, not the present. Vegetius, the Latin writer, wrote his treatise \"De Re Militari\" in the fourth century about Roman warfare, and Hagger posits that this still would have provided the basis for military thinking in the eleventh century. Vegetius said, \"The main and principal point in war is to secure plenty of provisions and to destroy the enemy by famine\", so Hagger's conclusion is that the Harrying of the North was no worse than other similar conflicts of the time.\n\nOther historians have questioned the figures supplied by Orderic Vitalis, who was born in 1075 and would have been writing \"Ecclesiastical History\" around 55 years after the event. The figure of 100,000 deaths was perhaps used in a rhetorical sense, as the estimated population for the whole of England, based on the 1086 Domesday returns, was about 2.25 million; thus, a figure of 100,000 represented a large proportion of the entire population of the country at that time (~4.5%).\n\nDavid Horspool concludes that despite the Harrying of the North, being regarded with some \"shock\" in Northern England for some centuries after the event, the destruction may have been exaggerated and the number of dead not as high as previously thought.\n\nIn 1076 William appointed another Earl of Northumbria. This time it was William Walcher, a Lotharingian, who had been appointed the first non-English Bishop of Durham in 1071.\nHaving effectively subdued the population, William carried out a complete replacement of Anglo-Saxon leaders with Norman ones in the North. The new aristocracy in England was predominately of Norman extraction; however, one exception was that of Alan Rufus, a trusted Breton lord, who obtained in 1069–1071 a substantial fiefdom in North Yorkshire, which the Domesday Book calls \"the Hundred of the Land of Count Alan\", later known as Richmondshire. Here Alan governed, as it were, his own principality: the only location held by the King in this area was Ainderby Steeple on its eastern edge, while Robert of Mortain\nheld one village on its southern fringe; the other Norman lords were excluded, whereas Alan retained the surviving Anglo-Danish lords or their heirs. Alan also exercised patronage in York, where he founded St Mary's Abbey in 1088. By 1086 Alan was one of the richest and most powerful men in England.\n\nIn Scotland, Malcolm married the Ætheling's sister, Margaret, in 1071. Edgar sought Malcolm's assistance in his struggle against William. The marriage of Malcolm to Edgar's sister profoundly affected the history of both England and Scotland. The influence of Margaret and her sons brought about the Anglicisation of the Lowlands and provided the Scottish king with an excuse for forays into England, which he could claim were to redress the wrongs against his brother-in-law.\n\nThe formal link between the royal house of Scotland and Wessex was a threat to William, who marched up to Scotland in 1072 to confront the Scottish king. The two kings negotiated the Treaty of Abernethy (1072), through which, according to the \"Anglo Saxon Chronicle\", Malcolm became William's vassal; among the other provisions was the expulsion of Edgar Ætheling from the Scottish court. Edgar finally submitted to William in 1074. William's hold on the crown was then theoretically uncontested.\n\nIn 1080 Walcher, the Bishop of Durham, was murdered by the local Northumbrians. In response, William sent his half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux north with an army to harry the Northumbrian countryside. Odo destroyed much land north of the Tees, from York to Durham, and stole valuable items from Durham monastery. Many of the Northumbrian nobility were driven into exile.\n\nAs a result of the depopulation, Norman landowners sought settlers to work in the fields. Evidence suggests that such barons were willing to rent lands to any men not obviously disloyal. Unlike the Vikings in the centuries before, Normans did not settle wholesale in the shire, but only occupied the upper ranks of society. This allowed an Anglo-Scandinavian culture to survive beneath Norman rule. Evidence for continuity can be seen in the retention of many cultural traits:\nOf the monasteries built, Fountains Abbey became one of the largest and richest. Along with the foundation of the northern monasteries, the Normans increased the number of motte-and-bailey castles they built there.\n\nThe Normans used the church as an agent of colonisation and, post-1070, founded several monasteries in the north. There had been no monasteries north of Burton upon Trent before the harrying. \nFrom the Norman point of view, the Harrying of the North was a successful strategy, as large areas, including Cheshire, Shropshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire were devastated, and the Domesday Book confirms this, although in those counties it was not as complete as in Yorkshire. The object of the harrying was to prevent further revolts in Mercia and Northumbria; however, it did not prevent rebellions elsewhere.\n\n\n"}

Owned by Cumulus Media, KNBR is a full-time FM simulcast of sister station KNBR (680 AM). Both stations are the San Francisco affiliate for CBS Sports Radio; the flagship station for the San Francisco Giants Radio Network and a co-flagship station for the San Francisco 49ers Radio Network (along with sister stations KSAN and KGO); and the radio home of Greg Papa and Tom Tolbert. The KNBR studios are located on Battery Street in San Francisco, while the station transmitter resides on Mount Sutro, off La Avanzada Street. In addition to a standard analog transmission, KNBR simulcasts over low-power analog Pleasanton translator KNBR-FM3 (104.5 FM), broadcasts over a single HD Radio channel, and is available online. \n\nThe station signed on the air on February 4, 1960 as KBAY-FM. It was owned by Kaiser Broadcasting, a company started by local industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. It aired a \"good music\" format, mostly instrumental easy listening with some middle of the road songs and soft pop vocals.\n\nIn 1964, the call sign switched to KFOG in honor of the city's fog layer, and the station aired a beautiful music format, again largely instrumental music, cover versions of popular songs with some Broadway and Hollywood show tunes. Within a few years, KFOG got competition from other beautiful music stations: KABL-AM-FM (now KNEW and KISQ) and from KOIT, as well as San Jose-based KBAY (now KBRG). For the next two decades, beautiful music was popular in the Bay Area. By the early 1980s, the format was showing signs of aging. KFOG was acquired by General Electric in 1974.\n\nOn September 16, 1982, KFOG dropped the easy listening format for a blend of album-oriented rock (AOR) and classic rock, which the station called \"Timeless Rock.\" The first song on the new format was \"Rock This Town\" by The Stray Cats. The station featured a wide range of music, from the psychedelic sounds of the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane to newer artists such as Prince, the Eurythmics, and the Thompson Twins. \n\nKFOG avoided commercial-sounding bands such as Loverboy and REO Speedwagon, which were widely played on more mass-appeal AOR stations at the time. KFOG was inspired by San Francisco's freeform rock radio heritage, dating back to KSAN, a pioneering progressive rock station (now KYLD).\n\nWhen KFOG changed to rock in the early 1980s, the Bay Area already had numerous competing rock stations; KMEL was the established, tightly-formatted AOR station that had been playing rock music since 1977. KRQR was the hard rock station and KQAK was a new station with a friendly, loosely programmed, personality-driven alternative rock/new wave format. There were two other rock stations in the South Bay - KSJO and KOME. One other San Francisco rock station, KSFX, switched to talk radio in May of that year. Of the six Bay Area rock stations that were on the air in late 1982, KFOG had been the last of the heritage rock stations. \n\nIn 1989, KFOG was acquired by the Susquehanna Radio Corp., along with KNBR, for $17.5 million. Susquehanna later merged into Cumulus Media, the current owner.\n\nThe station evolved over the years, but KFOG aired an eclectic rock format for more than a quarter century. In the 1990s, it adjusted its playlist to an adult album alternative (AAA) direction. In August 1995, it became \"KFOG 97.7 and 104.5,\" when Susquehanna acquired San Jose station KHQT (97.7 FM) and turned it into KFFG, simulcasting KFOG on a full-time basis.\n\nOn March 31, 2016, KFOG took all of its DJs off the air and began promoting an \"evolution\" to take place on April 20. On that day, at 6 a.m., KFOG relaunched its AAA format under the new slogan \"Music Matters,\" and shifted its playlist to focus on songs from the 1990s to the present day. The first song under the \"Music Matters\" branding was \"Times Like These\" by Foo Fighters. \n\nAs part of the change, former New York City rock DJ Bryan Schock was hired as Operations Manager/Program Director for KFOG and classic rock sister station KSAN. Most of the KFOG airstaff, including morning host Renee Richardson, midday host Annalisa, afternoon host Bill Webster, night host Dred Scott, and weekend host Rosalie Howarth, were let go from the station. By 2018, the station gradually transitioned to a more mainstream alternative format. It then directly competed with KITS.\n\nAt 9:00 p.m. on May 31, 2019, KFOG slightly re-branded as \"KFOG 104.5,\" as KFFG was sold off to EMF and became K-Love affiliate KJLV; the station adopted a new logo to reflect the sale of the repeater. The last song before the simulcast broke was \"High Hopes\" by Panic! At The Disco.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, Cumulus announced that KFOG would drop its rock format on September 6th to simulcast sister station KNBR. \n\nOn its final day as a music station, starting at 6 a.m., KFOG aired a tribute to its long run as a rock station with a day-long marathon of old \"10@10\" broadcasts and recordings taken from the station's \"Live From the Archives\" CD series. The exception was the 8 a.m. hour, a repeat of Dave Morey's final morning show before his retirement in 2008, and the 5 p.m. hour, in which KFOG paid tribute to longtime DJ Mike ‘M Dung’ Slavko's Sunday night freeform radio program \"The Idiot Show\". In addition, the station identifications for that day were taken from the pre-1982 beautiful music format. \n\nDuring the final hour, KFOG rebroadcast its 1982 flip to AAA, followed by a \"10@10\" broadcast of \"666 - Day of Doom Devil Music\" which originally aired June 6, 2006, then a short set of songs which culminated with \"Brokedown Palace\" by the Grateful Dead. After a final sign-off consisting of eight minutes of waves, seagulls, and foghorns that were the station's longtime trademark, and a minute of silence, KFOG officially flipped to the simulcast. On the same day, the call sign KNBR-FM was adopted; the KFOG call letters have since been warehoused on an AM station in Little Rock, Arkansas, the former KPZK.\n\nThe station is rebroadcast on the following FM booster:\n\nAs KFOG, it broadcast two feeds in HD Radio, the first was a simulcast of the analog feed and the second carried \"All-10@10-All-The-Time.\" The HD2 feed was taken off air in 2015. The HD1 feed returned when the station became KNBR-FM.\n"}

No other known Canadian university that uses this title. The term Senior Stick is also sometimes used to refer to the actual stick of office carried by a Senior Stick.\n\nThe stick of office is a staff of office carried by the Senior Stick as a symbol of their position.\n\nWhile the styles of sticks of office vary greatly between student associations, they are typically composed of an elongated wooden rod, painted or stained dark, with a metal bottom cap and an ornamental metal top in either silver or gold.\n\nThe University of Manitoba Engineering Society (UMES) has been electing a Senior Stick to serve as its head since 1909. Every spring at the annual UMES graduation ceremony the ceremonial passing of the Stick-of-Office takes place. During this ceremony the outgoing Senior Stick passes the newest Stick-of-Office to the incoming Senior Stick and whispers words of wisdom that have been passed down from Senior Stick to Senior Stick. These words are only known by the Senior Sticks and no one else. At the end of every year the name of the outgoing Senior Stick is added to the Stick-of-Office along with the year that they served as Senior Stick.\n\nThe tradition of having a Senior Stick as president of UMES was brought to the University of Manitoba by Professor E.E. Brydon-Jack who was named as the first professor of engineering at the University of Manitoba in 1906. After starting in engineering this tradition of having a Senior Stick quickly spread to all faculties at the University of Manitoba. There was insufficient funds for the creation of the first Stick-of-Office until 1927. At this point all the names of the previous Senior Sticks dating back to 1907 were added retroactively. In 1987 the first Stick-of-Office no longer had any room for additional names. A new Stick-of-Office was commissioned and the names of all the Senior Sticks since 1988 have been added to this Stick-of-Office instead.\n\nThe Faculty of Arts followed the Faculty of Engineering and started electing a Senior Stick in 1915. The Faculty of Arts elected both a Senior Stick and a lady stick until 1974. In 1975 the Faculty of Arts then decided to drop the position of lady stick and simply allow both male and female students to run for Senior Stick.\n\nAt the University of Manitoba there are meetings that are called between all of the Senior Sticks. These meetings are called by the University of Manitoba Students' Union. These meetings are called Board Of Senior Stick or BOSS for short.\n"}

Warren and his son George own and run Queensberry Promotions. Warren was also a founder of the British boxing television channel BoxNation.\n\nFrank Warren has promoted and managed world champions and top ranked fighters including Naseem Hamed, Frank Bruno, Tyson Fury, Josh Warrington, Joe Calzaghe, Nigel Benn, Billy Joe Saunders, Steve Collins, Chris Eubank, Amir Khan and Ricky Hatton.\n\nThe son of a bookmaker, Warren trained as a solicitor's clerk with J Tickle & Co on Southampton Row in London.\n\nWarren was approached by his second-cousin Lenny McLean who having just lost a fight and wanting a rematch, could not find a promoter. Warren agreed to become an unlicensed promoter, getting McLean a trainer who had worked with Chris Finnegan, and made the rematch at the Rainbow Theatre, Finsbury Park.\n\nWarren's first licensed show was held at the Bloomsbury Crest Hotel, in London in 1980, promoting two unknown United States heavyweights. However, although he had arranged TV coverage, he was blocked from broadcasting the fight by the British Boxing Board of Control rules preventing first-time from televising their first fights. However Warren was later given his first TV date with the BBC in a British light welterweight fight between London's champion Clinton McKenzie and Coventry contender Steve Early.\n\nWarren soon became a leading figure in British boxing, and since has managed some of Britain's best boxers of the last twenty five years, including 'Prince' Naseem Hamed, Nigel Benn, Joe Calzaghe, Ricky Hatton, Dereck Chisora, Nicky Piper and Amir Khan.\n\nWarren guided Hamed to become Britain's youngest ever world champion when he beat Steve Robinson to win the WBO Featherweight title at the Cardiff Arms Park, Wales, in 1995; he oversaw the ascent of Ricky Hatton to the IBF Light Welterweight Championship of the World after beating Kostya Tszyu in 2005; and has been with former IBF and WBO/WBC/WBA/Ring Magazine Super Middleweight Champion Joe Calzaghe throughout the majority of his 46 fight unbeaten career.\n\nWarren signed the 2004 Olympic Lightweight silver medallist Amir Khan and guided him to be a world champion in 2009, but the two split in 2010. He continued this post-Olympic record by signing others after the 2008 Olympics.\n\nIn December 2007, Warren was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame and was inducted in June 2008.\n\nWarren's major vehicles for promotion are Sports Network Ltd and Sports Network Europe, which employ 15 people, but rises up to 1,000 on the day of a big fight. In 1995 Warren signed an exclusive deal with the pay-TV operator British Sky Broadcasting, but having moved his promotions successfully around all of the UK television networks, he has now severed all ties with Sky Sports.\n\nAfter the loss of the dispute with Calzaghe, Sports Network Ltd was put into administration.\n\nIn July 2011, Warren started the BoxNation TV channel alongside the Boxing Channel Media Limited group. The channel was originally free-to-air and only released on the Sky platform, but on 1 December 2011 BoxNation was broadcast on Virgin Media for the first time and became a subscription channel at the same time.\n\nOn 30 November 1989, Warren was shot outside the Broadway Theatre in Barking by an unknown assailant wearing a balaclava, who was never caught. A .22 bullet from a Luger pistol missed Warren's heart by an inch, and he lost half a lung and parts of his ribs. The former boxer, Terry Marsh, who had become Warren's first world champion two years earlier, was accused of the shooting but acquitted by a jury.\n\nWarren was also the founder and owner of the London Arena. Beset by transport problems, he was about to raise additional finance until shot - he says the incident cost him £8million, as he was forced to sell it in 1996.\n\nWarren has major share holdings in various hotel developments in Portugal, and a share in one of New York City's top restaurants, the Michelin-starred 81, off Central Park.\n\nWarren also invested in Hertford Town FC.\n\nWarren also invested in Bedford RFC \"Bedford Blues\" during the 1996–97 season, taking over as chairman from Ian Bullerwell. The club went on to win the Allied Dunbar Division 2 Championship in 1998.\n\nWarren is a fan of Arsenal F.C. He lives in\nWatton-at-Stone in Hertfordshire with his family.\n\nWarren appeared as himself in \"Raging Pig\", an episode of \"Operation Good Guys\". Warren observed, \"A few people have seen that show! It is funny, I read somewhere that someone had done a review on one of our videos and they asked why I'm such a miserable bastard - it goes to show that they don't know me. Ask anyone who knows me; I'm a pretty outgoing person. Operation Good Guys was put together by Ray Burdis, who is a good mate of mine, and I enjoyed it. Maybe people get pre-conceived views of who I am but I do enjoy myself and have my bit of fun.

{"id": "1935911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935911", "title": "Avestan alphabet", "text": "Avestan alphabet\n\nThe Avestan alphabet () is a writing system developed during Iran's Sassanid era (226–651 CE) to render the Avestan language.\n\nAs a side effect of its development, the script was also used for Pazend, a method of writing Middle Persian that was used primarily for the \"Zend\" commentaries on the texts of the Avesta. In the texts of Zoroastrian tradition, the alphabet is referred to as \"din dabireh\" or \"din dabiri\", Middle Persian for \"the religion's script\".\n\nThe development of the Avestan alphabet was initiated by the need to represent recited Avestan language texts correctly. The various text collections that today constitute the canon of Zoroastrian scripture are the result of a collation that occurred in the 4th century, probably during the reign of Shapur II (309–379). It is likely that the Avestan alphabet was an \"ad hoc\" innovation related to this – \"Sassanid archetype\" – collation.\n\nThe enterprise, \"which is indicative of a Mazdean revival and of the establishment of a strict orthodoxy closely connected with the political power, was probably caused by the desire to compete more effectively with Buddhists, Christians, and Manicheans, whose faith was based on a revealed book\". In contrast, the Zoroastrian priesthood had for centuries been accustomed to memorizing scripture — following by rote the words of a teacher-priest until they had memorized the words, cadence, inflection and intonation of the prayers. This they passed on to their pupils in turn, so preserving for many generations the correct way to recite scripture. This was necessary because the priesthood considered (and continue to consider) precise and correct enunciation and cadence a prerequisite of effective prayer. Further, the recitation of the liturgy was (and is) accompanied by ritual activity that leaves no room to attend to a written text.\n\nThe ability to correctly render Avestan did, however, have a direct benefit: By the common era the Avestan language words had almost ceased to be understood, which led to the preparation of the \"Zend\" texts (from Avestan \"zainti\" \"understanding\"), that is commentaries on and translations of the canon. The development of the Avestan alphabet allowed these commentaries to interleave quotation of scripture with explanation thereof. The direct effect of these texts was a \"standardized\" interpretation of scripture that survives to the present day. For scholarship these texts are enormously interesting since they occasionally preserve passages that have otherwise been lost.\n\nThe 9th–12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition suggest that there was once a much larger collection of \"written\" Zoroastrian literature, but these texts — if they ever existed — have since been lost, and it is hence not known what script was used to render them. The question of the \"existence\" of a pre-Sassanid \"Arsacid archetype\" occupied Avestan scholars for much of the 19th century, and, \"[w]hatever may be the truth about the Arsacid Avesta, the linguistic evidence shows that even if it did exist, it can not have had any practical influence, since no linguistic form in the Vulgate can be explained with certainty as resulting from wrong transcription and the number of doubtful cases is minimal; in fact it is being steadily reduced. Though the existence of an Arsacid archetype is not impossible, it has proved to contribute nothing to Avestan philology.\"\n\nThe Pahlavi script, upon which the Avestan alphabet is based, was in common use for representing various Middle Iranian languages, but was not adequate for representing a religious language that demanded precision since Pahlavi was a simplified abjad syllabary with at most 22 symbols, most of which were ambiguous (i.e. could represent more than one sound).\n\nIn contrast, Avestan was a full alphabet, with explicit characters for vowels, and allowed for phonetic disambiguation of allophones. The alphabet included many characters (\"a\", \"i\", \"k\", \"t\", \"p\", \"b\", \"m\", \"n\", \"r\", \"s\", \"z\", \"š\", \"x\") from cursive Pahlavi, while some (\"ā\", \"γ\") are characters that only exist in the Psalter Pahlavi variant (in cursive Pahlavi \"γ\" and \"k\" have the same symbol). Some of the vowels, such as \"ə\" appear to derive from Greek minuscules. Avestan \"o\" is a special form of Pahlavi \"l\" that exists only in Aramaic signs. Some letters (e.g. \"ŋ́\", \"ṇ\", \"ẏ\", \"v\"), are free inventions.\n\nAvestan script, like Pahlavi script and Aramaic script also, is written from right to left. In Avestan script, letters are not connected, and ligatures are \"rare and clearly of secondary origin\".\n\nIn total, the Avestan alphabet has 37 consonants and 16 vowels. There are two main transcription schemes for Avestan, the newer style used by Karl Hoffmann and the older style used by Christian Bartholomae.\n\nLater, when writing Middle Persian in the script (i.e. Pazend), another consonant was added to represent the /l/ phoneme that didn't exist in the Avestan language.\n\nFour ligatures are commonly used in Avestan manuscripts:\n\nU+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER can be used to prevent ligatures if desired.\nFor example, compare (U+10B31 10B00) with (U+10B31 200C 10B00).\n\nFossey lists 16 ligatures, but most are formed by the interaction of swash tails.\n\nDigits and numbers can be seen on the Faulmann chart above.\n\nWords and the end of the first part of a compound are separated by a dot (in a variety of vertical positions). Beyond that, punctuation is weak or non-existent in the manuscripts, and in the 1880s Karl Friedrich Geldner had to devise one for standardized transcription. In his system, which he developed based on what he could find, a triangle of three dots serves as a colon, a semicolon, an end of sentence or end of section; which is determined by the size of the dots and whether there is one dot above and two below, or two above and one below. Two above and one below signify — in ascending order of \"dot\" size — colon, semicolon, end of sentence or end of section.\n\nThe Avestan alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2009 with the release of version 5.2.\n\nThe characters are encoded at U+10B00—10B35 for letters (\"ii\" and \"uu\" are not represented as single characters, but as sequences of characters) and U+10B38—10B3F for punctuation.\n\nThe above likely display in Noto Sans Avestan font, which has four automated ligatures. There is also,\n\n"}

Started in 1897 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as a manufacturer of Brass Era automobiles, and trucks from 1899, Autocar is the oldest surviving motor vehicle brand in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe last cars were produced in 1911 and the company continued as a maker of severe-duty trucks. In 1953 Autocar was taken over by the White Motor Company which made Autocar their top-of-the-line brand. White was taken over in turn by Volvo Trucks in 1981 with Autocar continuing as a division. In 2001, Autocar was acquired by GVW Group, LLC, which revived Autocar as an independent company. Autocar now builds four models of custom-engineered, heavy-duty trucks and has regained leading positions in several vocational segments.\n\nThe company was called the \"Pittsburgh Motor Vehicle Company\" when started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1897 but was renamed the Autocar Company in 1899 when it moved to Ardmore, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia. One of the company's early cars was the Pittsburgher. By 1907, the company had decided to concentrate on commercial vehicles, and the \"Autocar\" brand is still in use for commercial trucks. Autocar is the oldest surviving motor vehicle brand in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nBased on the minutes of company board of directors meetings during 1903–1907 it is known that in 1903 the board of directors included the president, Louis S. Clarke, the secretary, John S. Clarke, as well as, James K. Clarke. Both Louis Semple Clarke and his brother John S. Clarke were members of the fabled South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club of Johnstown Flood fame.\n\nAutocar founder Louis Semple Clarke (1867–1957) was a successful mechanical engineer. Among Clarke's innovations were the spark plug for gasoline engines, a perfected drive shaft system for automobiles, and the first design of a useful oil circulation system. Clarke's initiative to place the driver on the left hand side of the vehicle was ahead of its time but eventually became the standard in much of the automotive industry worldwide. Clarke also developed the first porcelain-insulated spark plugs in America and the Autocar thread specification became the standard in the U.S. automotive industry.\n\nClarke was also a talented photographer. His family were members of the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club above Johnstown, Pennsylvania, whose earthen dam at Lake Conemaugh burst on May 31, 1889, causing the Johnstown Flood.\n\nClarke sold his interest in Autocar in 1929 and retired from business. He died in Palm Beach, Florida, on January 6, 1957, and is buried in Allegheny Cemetery, in Pittsburgh.\n\n \n\nAutocar experimented with a series of vehicles from 1897, with a tricycle, \"Autocar No. 1\", now in the collection of the Smithsonian. In 1899 Autocar built the first motor truck ever produced for sale in North America. The first production Autocar automobile was a 1900 single cylinder chain drive runabout. About 27 were made. In 1901 Autocar built the first car in North America to use shaft drive. This vehicle is also now in the Smithsonian collection.\n\nThe 1904 Autocar was equipped with a tonneau, it could seat four passengers and sold for US$1700. The horizontal-mounted flat twin engine, situated at the front of the car, produced 11 hp (8.2 kW). This was a somewhat unusual engine design for the time, with most companies producing inline designs. A three-speed transmission was fitted. The steel and wood-framed car weighed 1675 lb (760 kg). The early cars had tiller steering.\n\nIn 1905, the company was selling the Type XII car for $2,250 and another it called the Type X for $1,000. It discontinued the Type XI and sold the last of them in 1905. The cars then had a wheel steering with left-hand drive.\n\nThe Type X was a runabout. During the 1905–1906 model year the company produced 1000 Type X cars. The manufacture of 500 Type XV runabouts was authorized for 1907 in place of 500 touring cars (Type XIV) in addition to the 1000 runabouts already planned. At special meeting on June 19, 1906 held at 711 Arcade Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the board authorized the hiring of a general manager by the name of Harry A. Gillis at a salary of $10,000 per year. Production of 300 Type XVI cars and 500 Type XVII were authorized during a board meeting on November 21, 1906.\n\nCommercial vehicles were made the focus from 1907 and soon outnumbered cars.\n\nAs of 1911, Autocar was making only trucks. The first model, the Type XVII, had a 97-inch wheelbase, a one and a half-ton capacity, and a two-cylinder gasoline engine under the seat. Later engines had 4 and 6 cylinders, and wheelbases became longer. Inline engines became the company's focus.\n\nDuring World War I, the Canadian Armoured Autocar used an Autocar chassis.\n\nIn 1929, Autocar sold 3300 units, though the number fell to 1000 in 1932 and continued to decline during the Great Depression. Larger trucks with \"Blue Streak\" gasoline engines and Diesel engines, mainly from Cummins, came later.\n\nDuring World War II, Autocar supplied 50,000 units to the military, including specialty vehicles such as half-tracks; during its entire prewar history, the company had only built 70,000 units. Autocar ranked 85th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. Civilian production resumed in 1944 and sales increased greatly after the war. Autocar soon had 100 dealers.\n\nThe boom after the war ended quickly, however; and in 1953, Autocar sold out to the White Motor Company, which made Autocar their top-of-the-line brand among their \"Big Four\" brand portfolio. The Ardmore plant was replaced in 1954 with a new plant in Exton, Pennsylvania, though the Ardmore plant burned while being torn down in 1956 and the fire could have destroyed a neighborhood.\n\nAutocar's \"Custom Engineering\" process for meeting each customer's needs led to a reputation as \"World's Finest\". White replaced Blue Streak engines with its own Mustang, and production of gasoline-powered trucks ended in 1965.\n\nAP off-road vehicles became an important product for Autocar. The 1964 AP19 shown in September 2007 at a Golden Age Truck Museum exhibit \"has a GCW of 900,000 lbs, a 30,000lb front axle, planetary rear axles rated at 200,000 lbs, and was originally powered with a 525 HP Cummins V-12 diesel which was later replaced with a 6-cylinder Cummins KT rated at 750 HP.\"\n\nMost Autocar trucks continued to use the Autocar Driver Cab; in 1977 Autocar launched the Construcktor 2 model which used the Xpeditor cab that had recently been launched by sister-company, White.\n\nThe Exton plant ended production in 1980, with production moving to the modern White plant in Ogden, Utah.\n\nShortly after the move to Utah in 1980, with White insolvent, in 1981 AB Volvo acquired the U.S. assets and brands to become Volvo-White LLC. Volvo produced trucks under both the White and Autocar brands and Autocar continued as the division focused on severe-duty trucks. The Autocar DK severe-duty line was launched in 1983 and, as a replacement of the venerable DC line, was widely used in heavy dump truck, concrete mixer, refuse, and oil field applications, among many others. Also launched in 1983 was the widely admired Autocar AT64F, a top-of-the-line long-haul tractor marketed as \"The Legend\". The last traditional Autocar with a \"Custom Driver Cab\" was made in Ogden on December 18, 1987. In 1988, the DK was replaced by the Autocar ACL and ACM models, which used the White Xpeditor cab, first used by Autocar in the Construcktor 2 model. While the AC-series trucks were tough and reliable, they incorporated an expanded number of Volvo components and, for some Autocar loyalists, marked a dilution of the Autocar brand.\nVolvo-White bought GMC's heavy truck business in 1987 creating the Volvo WhiteGMC brand. Volvo later dropped any reference to White but used the Autocar bow-tie emblem on the radiator and hood side panels. In 1996 \"Autocar\" became a truck model name.\n\nAutocar remained a part of Volvo until 2001. When Volvo acquired the North American operations of Renault Trucks in 1980, including its wholly owned subsidiary Mack Trucks, the merged company would have had an excess or anti-competitive share of the refuse truck market sector. Volvo agreed to sell select vehicle designs for the Xpeditor low cab-forward heavy-duty product, intellectual properties, and the Autocar brand to Highland Park, Illinois-based \"Grand Vehicle Works Holdings, LLC\" (GVW). Autocar had previously used White's Xpeditor cab in the Autocar Construcktor 2 (from 1977) and it continued to be used in the ACL and ACM conventional truck models manufactured by Volvo.\n\nOnce again independent after nearly 50 years, as of 2019 the Autocar company now employs over 400 at its manufacturing facilities in Birmingham, Alabama (model ACX cabover and model DC trucks) and Hagerstown, Indiana, where the company produces custom-engineered ACMD and ACTT models for severe-duty vocational applications. The company's severe-duty ACX model offers features ranging from improved ergonomic cabs, integrated controls, and complex multiple axle configurations, up to triple-steer, triple-drive 12x6 trucks weighing over 100,000 lbs. The Autocar ACX is now second nationally in several segments, including concrete pump trucks and refuse trucks. The Autocar ACTT is a leading model of terminal tractor. The company has a nationwide service network in the US. Autocar's customer base includes large fleets, private fleets and major municipalities in the United States and Canada such as Miami, Newark, Houston, Chicago and Vancouver.\n\nAutocar announced on September 13, 2017, that it had opened a second, 1.2 million square-foot manufacturing site in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nSince 2012, Autocar also builds a medium-duty vocational truck series called the Xpert (ACMD). It uses a 2-3 person cab made by Chinese Qixing (QX-PW21TGD). Autocar has also offered the Xpert with dual-steering system for garbage truck service.\n\nAutocar announced on May 7, 2019, the relaunch of the DC conventional truck that had been the core of Autocar's business from the 1950s through the 1970s. The relaunched DC is completely new and reported to have several unique features, such as the first 160,000 PSI steel frame rails, an upgraded electrical system, and a cab that fits three workers and is designed for serviceability, with a full steel structure inside the dashboard and aluminum sheets as dash panels. The first version released is the DC-64R, which is purpose-built for refuse applications. Another unique feature of the DC is that Autocar mounts full roll-off hoist bodies on the Autocar production line, avoiding numerous problems when modifications are made after production. Additional variations of the DC announced include the DC-64M for concrete mixer trucks and the DC-64P specifically for Concrete pump trucks.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its molecular structure consists of a central azo functional group, RN=NR, flanked by two ethyl ester groups. This orange-red liquid is a valuable reagent but also quite dangerous and explodes upon heating. Therefore, commercial shipment of pure diethyl azodicarboxylate is prohibited in the United States and is carried out either in solution or on polystyrene particles.\n\nDEAD is an aza-dienophile and an efficient dehydrogenating agent, converting alcohols to aldehydes, thiols to disulfides and hydrazo groups to azo groups; it is also a good electron acceptor. While DEAD is used in numerous chemical reactions it is mostly known as a key component of the Mitsunobu reaction, a common strategy for the preparation of an amine, azide, ether, thioether, or ester from the corresponding alcohol. It is used in the synthesis of various natural products and pharmaceuticals such as zidovudine, an AIDS drug; FdUMP, a potent antitumor agent; and procarbazine, a chemotherapy drug.\n\nDEAD is an orange-red liquid which weakens its color to yellow or colorless upon dilution or chemical reaction. This color change is conventionally used for visual monitoring of the synthesis. DEAD dissolves in most common organic solvents, such as toluene, chloroform, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane but has low solubility in water or carbon tetrachloride; the solubility in water is higher for the related azo compound di\"methyl\" azodicarboxylate.\n\nDEAD is a strong electron acceptor and easily oxidizes a solution of sodium iodide in glacial acetic acid. It also reacts vigorously with hydrazine hydrate producing diethyl hydrazodicarboxylate and evolving nitrogen. Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method (LCAO-MO) calculations suggest that the molecule of DEAD is unusual in having a high-lying vacant bonding orbital, and therefore tends to withdraw hydrogen atoms from various hydrogen donors. Photoassisted removal of hydrogen by DEAD was demonstrated for isopropyl alcohol, resulting in pinacol and tetraethyl tetrazanetetracarboxylate, and for acetaldehyde yielding diacetyl and diethyl hydrazodicarboxylate. Similarly, reacting DEAD with ethanol and cyclohexanol abstracts hydrogen producing acetaldehyde and cyclohexanone. Those reactions also proceed without light, although at much lower yields.\nThus, in general DEAD is an aza-dienophile and dehydrogenating agent, converting alcohols to aldehydes, thiols to disulfides and hydrazo groups to azo groups. It also undergoes pericyclic reactions with alkenes and dienes via Ene and Diels–Alder mechanisms.\n\nAlthough available commercially, diethyl azodicarboxylate can be prepared fresh in the laboratory, especially if required in pure, non-diluted form. A two-step synthesis starts from hydrazine, first by alkylation with ethyl chloroformate, followed by treating the resulting diethyl hydrazodicarboxylate with chlorine (bubbling through the solution), hypochlorous acid, concentrated nitric acid or red fuming nitric acid. The reaction is carried out in an ice bath, and the reagents are added dropwise so that the temperature does not rise above 20 °C. Diethyl hydrazodicarboxylate is a solid with melting temperature of 131–133 °C which is collected as a residue; it is significantly more stable to heating than DEAD and is conventionally dried at a temperature of about 80 °C.\n\nDEAD is a reagent in the Mitsunobu reaction where it forms an adduct with phosphines (usually triphenylphosphine) and assists the synthesis of esters, ethers, amines and thioethers of alcohols. Reactions normally result in the inversion of molecular symmetry.\n\nDEAD was used in the original 1967 article by Oyo Mitsunobu, and his 1981 review on the use of diethyl azodicarboxylate is a top-cited chemistry article. Mitsunobu reaction has several applications in the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn the above reaction, which is assisted either by DEAD or DIAD (diisopropyl azodicarboxylate), thymidine 1 transforms to the derivative 2. The latter easily converts to zidovudine 4 (also known as azidothymidine or AZT), an important antiviral drug, used among others in the treatment of AIDS. Another example of pharmaceutical application of DEAD-assisted Mitsunobu reaction is the synthesis of bis[(pivaloyloxy)methyll [PIVz] derivative of 2’-deoxy-5-fluorouridine 5’-monophosphate (FdUMP), which is a potent antitumor agent.\n\nThe azo group in DEAD is a Michael acceptor. In the presence of a copper(II) catalyst, DEAD assists conversion of β-keto esters to the corresponding hydrazine derivatives.\n\nThe substitution of boronic acid esters proceeds similarly:\n\nDEAD is an efficient component in Diels-Alder reactions and in click chemistry, for example the synthesis of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, which originates from Otto Diels. It has also been used to generate aza-Baylis-Hillman adducts with acrylates.\n\nDEAD can be used for synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Thus, pyrazoline derivatives convert by condensation to α,β-unsaturated ketones:\n\nAnother application is the use of DEAD as enophile in Ene reactions:\n\nDEAD is toxic, shock and light sensitive; it can violently explode when its undiluted form is heated above 100 °C. Shipment by air of pure diethyl azodicarboxylate is prohibited in the United States and is carried out in solution, typically about 40% DEAD in toluene. Alternatively, DEAD is transported and stored on 100–300 mesh polystyrene particles at a concentration of about 1 mmol/g. The time-weighed average threshold limit value for exposure to DEAD over a typical 40-hour working week is 50 parts per million; that is, DEAD is half as toxic as, e.g., carbon monoxide. Safety hazards have resulted in rapid decline of DEAD usage and replacement with DIAD and other similar compounds.\n"}
{"id": "1935974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935974", "title": "Yule Marble", "text": "Yule Marble\n\nYule Marble is a marble of metamorphosed limestone found only in the Yule Creek Valley, in the West Elk Mountains of Colorado, southeast of the town of Marble, Colorado. First discovered in 1873, it is quarried underground at an elevation of above sea level—in contrast to most marble, which is quarried from an open pit and at much lower elevations.\n\nThe localized geology created a marble that is 99.5% pure calcite, with a grain structure that gives a smooth texture, a homogeneous look, and a luminous surface. It is these qualities for which it was selected to clad the exterior of the Lincoln Memorial and a variety of other buildings throughout the United States, in spite of being more expensive than other marbles. The size of the deposits enables large blocks to be quarried, which is why the marble for the Tomb of the Unknowns, with its die block, was quarried from Yule Marble.\n\nYule's quality comes at a high price due to the cost of quarrying in a high-altitude mountain environment. This challenge has caused the industry and the town of Marble to undergo many boom-and-bust periods since quarrying started in the mid-1880s, making the town emblematic of the economic fluctuations that beset a single-industry economy. Technology advancements in quarrying machinery and transportation have reduced, but not solved, the cost problem that afflicts the operation through the present.\n\nThe forces that created Yule Marble make it distinct from all other American marbles. It was formed by contact metamorphism, unlike Vermont marble and Georgia marble, which are the result of regional metamorphism, a process more associated with the orogeny and erosion of mountain ranges on a regional scale. Tennessee marble did not undergo metamorphism, so is not true marble, which is metamorphic.\n\nIn evaluating the marble cross-section, the United States Geological Survey found the marble is bounded above and below by unconformities. This lack of conformable contact resulted in the early dating of the limestone as Silurian rather than the currently accepted Mississippian. The lack of conformable boundaries in exposures along the Treasure Mountain dome explains the variation in reported thicknesses in the quarry area west of Yule Creek of about southeast of the quarry. The overlying Pennsylvanian Molas Formation was an argillite unit which was converted to hornfels and quartzite. Stratigraphically below the Leadville, the chert bearing Devonian Dyer Dolomite Member of the Chaffee Formation was altered by the metamorphism to impure silica-rich marble and occasional serpentine-bearing marble.\n\nThe Yule Marble is a metamorphic facies of the regionally distributed Leadville Limestone of Mississippian age deposited 350 million to 324 million years ago. The Leadville within the Yule area was transformed by contact metamorphism that occurred during the latest Eocene and Oligocene epochs (34 million to 28 million years ago) associated with the intrusion and uplift of the nearby granitic Treasure Mountain Dome. The uplift of the Treasure Mountain Dome tilted the limestone away from the intrusion resulting in the marble bed dipping at an angle into the mountain. The marble unit along with older and younger adjacent units in the Yule Valley have a north-northwest strike paralleling the valley and variable dips of 35 to 50 degrees to the west-southwest. This local contact with the heat and pressure from the intrusion of hot granitic magma recrystallized the Leadville Limestone into a distinctive white marble. Although the Leadville Limestone covered hundreds of square miles and was the ore host at the Leadville mining district, the Yule Creek Valley is the only known location of marble in the region. When the magma cooled, it crystallized into granite.\n\nThis local geological activity resulted in a type of marble that is 99.5% pure calcite, with trace amounts of non-calcite inclusions (mainly quartz), and has a density of . The non-calcite inclusions were caused through penetrations along the seams created by the dome uplift rather than through metamorphic contact with the uplifted dome. Though marble is on both sides of the creek, the only visible marble is the seam of the present-day quarry on the west side of Yule Creek.\n\nDevelopment of Yule Marble is put into context with Colorado geology by showing the passage of time from earliest rock units to the present with \"Ga\" = billions of years ago and \"Ma\" = millions of years ago.\n\nIt is the grain of Yule Marble that gives an appearance of smooth texture, a homogeneous look, and a luminous surface that polishes well. These qualities are why it has been chosen for a number of major national and state landmarks, most notably the Lincoln Memorial. Because of its aesthetic value, architect Henry Bacon successfully urged that it be used to clad the whole exterior of the Memorial, even though it was the most expensive material.\n\nThe overall configuration of the grain is small, irregularly shaped, generally equidimensional to slightly elongated with irregular edges and does not vary significantly among the different grades (in 1992). The edges of the calcite grains are deeply crenulated (irregularly and minutely notched and scalloped). Grain sizes range primarily from 0.1 mm (0.00393 in) to 0.6 mm (0.0236 in), as determined by scanning electron microscope images. There are 2,000–3,000 grains to the square centimeter (0.1550 square inches). Where the marble is in direct contact with the intrusive granite, the most consistent change in the marble is that it becomes extremely coarse-grained, with the grain size in the contact zone being 10 mm to 20 mm (0.3937–0.7874 inches). The grains in turn are tightly bonded in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle, forming crystals which are aligned so that the long axes of the grains are essentially perpendicular to the principal veining in the deposit.\n\nWhen marble does break down, the cause is weak boundaries between the grains that permit water or solutions to penetrate into the marble. As water enters, the calcite grains dissolve slightly, and the opening between the grains widens. With time, as the grain openings widen, the edges become smooth, and the grains become rounded. As the surface grains become round, they loosen and fall off the surface of the stone. Because Yule Marble is finely grained with tight bonding, water is not likely to react as quickly as with a coarse-grained, loose-textured marble. Also the crenulated boundaries of Yule Marble crystals may account for the weathering resistance, because the spaces between grains must be widened enough to free adjoining crystals.\n\nIncluded in the grains are intrusions (non-calcite material) which does not vary significantly among the four grades; tests in the late 1990s confirm the 1910 amount of 0.5%. Constant inclusions in all Yules are magnesium oxide (MgO), manganese oxide (MnO), iron oxide (FeO), and strontium oxide (SrO) while other inclusions vary by quarry location. Inclusions are in four groups: quartz (the most abundant and gray in color); muscovite (mica, occurs as thin gold lines and streaks, and also occurs with quartz in clouds of gray mixed with brown); feldspar (with larger grain size 0.591 inches (15 mm) to 1.379 inches (35 mm) and gray in color but less translucent than quartz inclusions); and pyrite. Other minor inclusions are sphene, apatite, rutile, zircon, and sphalerite. An example of inclusion affect is gold veining, the result of iron or manganese, that is still quarried today.\n\nWhen the physical characteristics of Yule Marble are compared to the other US marble, the results are about the same for general characteristics of weight, hardness, specific gravity, porosity, absorption, and coefficient of thermal expansion. In strength characteristics, the properties of Yule Marble are lower than most of the other marbles for compressive strength and transverse strength, but they are not unreasonably low. For ordinary uses, stone having a compressive strength of 5,000 lb per square inch is satisfactory. Test results from 1913 to 1937 ranged from 6,694 to 10,195 pounds per square inch (471 to 717 kg per square cm); in 1996, results were 14,874 (1,046 kg per square cm).\n\nThe same geology that created the marble also created a host of problems in quarrying the stone. Quarrying in this high altitude environment with steep slopes, deep snow, and snow-mud slides is so expensive that advances in technology have not been able to overcome the challenges. These factors limit periods of operation and the amount of marble that can be brought down from the quarry. In the early years a lack of transportation to move enough of the stone out of Marble added to the difficulties. The transportation problem was largely mitigated by the advent of a railroad (1906 through 1941) and by road and truck since 1990. The cutting rates of today's equipment are much faster than the 1911 technology.\n\nLocated along and above the east and west side of Yule Creek, from an elevation of to were five quarries, of which only one on the west side is in operation today. Those on the west were the most productive being the John Osgood quarry (pit-type started in the early 1890s) and the present-day quarry started in 1905 by the Colorado-Yule Marble Company inside the mountain. The east side quarry, started in 1904 by the Strauss brothers, was quarried inside Whitehouse Mountain. Most marble quarries in the world today are pit-type operations, such as Carrara, Italy. The amount of Yule Marble remaining for quarrying should last for hundreds of years.\n\nUse of Yule Marble has grown through several periods of boom and bust from local to national, and today is international. The first major use was in the Colorado State Capitol building in 1895. Yule Marble quarried between 1907 and 1941 can be found in banks, mausoleums, libraries, schools, hotels, and government buildings from the west coast (Seattle south to Los Angeles) to the east coast, including the Equitable Building skyscraper in New York City. The dimension of the deposit enables large blocks to be quarried, which is why Yule Marble was selected for the Tomb of the Unknowns (Tomb of the Unknown Soldier) in Arlington National Cemetery. In 1931, the 56-ton (55.86 metric ton) block for the die section (on which six wreaths, three Greek figures, and the inscription were carved) was the largest single piece of marble ever quarried at that time. Today, the marble is primarily shipped to Italy to supply fabricators throughout Europe. Blocks also go to Saudi Arabia, Peru, and other developing international markets. Finished marble is used for tile and slabs (walls, countertops, etc.).\n\nAs the marble industry cycled, the town's economy, being based on a single industry, also fluctuated. At the same time, had Marble not made the transition from its origins as a mining town to quarrying Yule Marble, the town would have died, as did other Colorado mining towns such as nearby Crystal and Schofield.\n\nOn March 9, 2004, Yule Marble became the official state rock of Colorado. The designation was the result of petitioning by Girl Scout Troop 357 of Lakewood, Colorado of the Colorado General Assembly, who in turn passed a bill that was signed by Governor Bill Owens (R).\n\nYule Marble was discovered in the Crystal River Valley in the spring of 1873 by geologist Sylvester Richardson. George Yule (for whom the marble was later named) was the prospector who \"rediscovered\" the marble in 1874. In the same year, an unknown person took some marble—from which polished samples were made—and appeared in Denver but failed to generate interest. The marble became lost again, and was rediscovered 10 years later, yet again by accident. By this time, prospectors were digging into Whitehouse Mountain for silver and gold when they encountered the Treasure Mountain Dome and thick marble. This time a transition started that moved the town away from mining to one of quarrying marble, although some locals were still involved with mining in 1910. The transition enabled the town to survive while nearby towns such as Crystal and Schofield became ghost towns. The town was still a one-industry economy, and its future followed that of the marble operation.\n\nThe local miners never had the capital to develop marble quarries and in the 1890s they started selling marble claims:\n\nThough better financed, the new companies had little success in spite of growing interest in Yule Marble generated by glowing test results from London (1887), the St Louis Exposition (1890) and the Chicago Exposition (1893). The companies had different degrees of development and success with the quarry of John Osgood obtaining a major contract in 1895 to supply of marble for the new state capitol in Denver, Colorado. After this initial success, little production has accomplished by Osgood or the other two companies. The Osgood operation was well financed but even he was afflicted by the problems associated with developing and operating a quarry in the Yule Creek Valley. Also the lack of transportation to move enough of the stone out of Marble added to the difficulties. Taken together, these factors resulted in high operating costs that could not be covered by marble revenue. The high cost problems would also affect the next quarry and its operators up to the present time.\n\nIn 1905, another major transfer of leases took place with acquisitions by the newly formed Colorado-Yule Marble Company (CYMC). First was Channing Meek purchasing the marble deposits of the Marble City Quarry Company on 28 February 1905. He in turn sold the deposits to the newly formed CYMC on 11 April 1905 and subsequently became the CYMC president. The marble deposit that became the quarry of the CYMC was acquired on 14 November 1905 from Osgood. (Osgood never quarried the marble because of financial problems.) Because the three remaining quarries had no more production to speak of this leaves only the quarry started by the CYMC in 1905.\n\nWhen the Colorado-Yule Marble Company (CYMC) arrived in Marble in 1905 they developed the last Yule Marble quarry, which is still in production today. The operation showed the unrealized promise of the previous 20 years with a 10-year boom in which marble was shipped to the east and west coasts with contracts reaching one million dollars. The marble boom also resulted in one for the town of Marble. While the CYMC overcame some quarry problems of the previous 20 years, other difficulties ultimately led to their bankruptcy in April 1917. Subsequent operations from 1922 through 1941 were on a much smaller scale with several different operators and dramatic fluctuations in quarrying until the next bust at the end of 1941 After almost 50 years the quarry reopened in September 1990. The 1905 problems of transporting marble out of the town have been largely solved (by road and trucks) but the high costs of working in a mountain environment still exist today, and there have been several operator changes with the last one in 2010.\n\nThe quarry was part of the integrated operation created by the CYMC during 1905 into 1907, and was retained by subsequent operators until the quarry shut down in 1941. Once marble was out of the quarry, it was lowered onto CYMC transport for movement down to Marble, a descent of over with grades up to 54% (17% starting in 1910). In Marble, the stone entered an enormous CYMC mill site and was transformed into a variety of finished objects. The site was feet at its widest point and almost long under one roof, totaling . (It was the largest operation of its kind in the world.) Finished marble was moved into railroad cars of the CYMC-built Crystal River & San Juan Railway (CR&SJ) for shipment throughout the country.\n\nBuilding the CR&SJ solved a major problem of no viable transportation to move large quantities of the stone out of Marble. In November 1906, the CR&SJ completed a railway line from Marble to Placita, where it connected to the Crystal River Railway (CRR). (To support his coal and coke operations in the Redstone area, Osgood started building the CRR line in the late 1890s from Carbondale, Colorado southward reaching Redstone in June 1900. By the early 1900s, the line reached its final destination of Placita.) In 1910, the CR&SJ obtained a right-of-way to operate on the CRR line to Carbondale, from Marble. The railway also increased the efficiency of getting supplies to the operation from outside the Crystal River Valley. The town's residents benefited by the railroad for transportation with the depot on the grounds of the mill site. In later years, livestock was transported out of the Crystal River Valley by the railroad.\n\nDevelopment of the integrated operation also created a large debt that led directly to receivership in July 1916 and bankruptcy in April 1917. Although the spending created an operation using the best equipment and was technically efficient, the company was unable to repay the debt with marble revenue because of high operating costs. By 1913 CYMC was in financial trouble when a loan of $1,868,000 was approved early in 1913 and used to refinance the debt.\n\n1905 development started the first of three quarry openings with #2 in 1905. When Quarry 2 cutting started, none of the workers wanted to hang off the edge of the cliff sitting on a wooden bench attached to an overhead derrick. So the company president, Channing Meek, came up to the quarry, sat on the wooden bench, was lowered over the mountainside, and started cutting marble. After that no worker refused to go over the side and cut marble. Quarry 2 was followed by #3 in 1907 and #1 in 1912. A fourth opening to the left of #3 (out of view) was started but did not become a producing quarry.\nTo operate the quarries, structures for various functions were built around the quarry exterior. Wooden derricks were located by and above the openings to lift blocks out of the quarries. The boiler house (providing steam power for quarrying equipment) was the last major addition (second building to the right of opening 2). In front of the boiler house is a 50-ton (49.875 metric ton) electric hoist and the hoist electric power house is to the right of the boiler house. Below the boiler house area near the bottom of the photo is the Pea Vine (winch-cable powered carts on rails) used to move marble from the quarry to the loading station several hundred feet away, where it was placed on wagons for transport to the mill site. There are other facilities to the right of opening 1; compressor house, machine shop, and bunk house. To provide the needed electricity, the company built a hydro-electric plant with the generators located just east of the town limits and completed in July 1907.\nBy 1914 the quarry configuration had gone through several changes but from then on remained largely unchanged until the shut down in 1941. Several buildings located to the right of opening 1 had been relocated to opening 3, such as the machine shop (first building to the left of opening 2), offices (to the left of the machine shop), and the compressor house (first building on the right of opening 2 and left of the boiler house). The boarding house (not visible to the right of opening 1) was also relocated. In 1910, a new system was finished to get the stone from the quarry down to the finishing mill in the town of Marble. Two tall wooden derricks (one to the left opening 2 and another on the east side of Yule Creek) suspended an long cable. The 50-ton (49.875 metric ton) electric hoist attached a block to the cable for lowering marble to the new loading station and onto a railroad car (on standard gauge track) towed by the new electric tram finished in 1910. The electric tram replaced the Pea Vine. After closing in October 1941, the equipment inside was removed and the wood structures fell apart.\n\nWhen the quarry reopened in 1990, the functions of the previous structures that were needed were located inside the quarry. The only structures remaining from prior to 1942 are the two cable derricks. One major 1990 alteration to the cliff was the blasting of a tunnel for access to the quarry interior. Today the marble is loaded onto a truck inside the mountain and driven out.\n\nIn the early years, the quarry was three separate caverns inside the marble formation. By 1914 a tunnel connected the three caverns. As the quarry went further down into the marble the three caverns eventually joined into one. The marble quarry is similar to coal mines and other underground mines in the need to constantly pump out water. With the marble dust created from the cutting, the floor is covered with marble mud. The interior temperature normally varies no more than 20 °F (11 °C)\nranging from , although temperatures have reached from to a high of .\n\nThe number of people working in the quarry varied from 57 in 1910 to a maximum during the 1905-1917 boom of about 125. (Today that number varies between 15 and 20.) The 1910 Census shows most quarry personnel were American born, although the mill site employed more Italian-born workers. The 1910 Census recorded 57 quarry workers with 50 American born, 4 Italian, 2 German, and 1 Austrian. The marble mill employed 291 people of which 110 were American born and 120 born in Italy. As a side note, of the 481 town residents who were employed in 1910, 326 (66%) worked in the marble operation.\n\nResidence location showed only a few of the workers lived in Marble; the 1910 Census recorded 14 quarry employees there, and the rest lived in Quarry Town. Built by the CYMC, Quarry Town came into existence shortly after November 1908 as a settlement of bunkhouses and shacks just to the west and north of Quarry 1. It was built to alleviate a housing shortage caused by hiring more workers for the first large CYMC contract, the Cuyahoga County Court House, in Cleveland, Ohio. Though intended for single men, the 1910 Census recorded 66 residents of which 44 were men, 9 were women, and 13 were children. In the winter time, Quarry Town folk would ski down to Marble then return by holding onto an electric tram going up to the quarry (an early Colorado ski lift). Quarry Town was abandoned after the quarry closed in 1941 and today only a few scraps remain located behind the quarry fence.\n\nBootlegging started when Marble went dry after alcohol prohibition was passed by the voters on 3 December 1908. Prohibition was backed by the company because drunkenness was affecting the operation. Prohibition left workers in Quarry Town and folks in Marble without a close liquor supply (the town of Redstone was away). For those purchasing liquor from a bootlegger there were no legal worries for the law only made it illegal to sell or give away liquor; it was not illegal to purchase alcohol.\n\nWages became a source of conflict during this period. In 1909, daily wages ranged from $5 to $8 but no overtime pay was provided. During the 1930s Great Depression, they earned 40 cents an hour. A strike lasting three months started at the mill on 4 August 1909, and by the next day quarry workers started to join. The strikers were demanding an 8-hour day, time-and-a-half for overtime, and double time on Sunday. The company management quickly won the support of the public. By September, only 20 men were working at the mill and even fewer at the quarry. The strike lasted until 2 November with the workers going back to work at reduced wages. Full operations were resumed within a week.\n\nThe civic-mindedness of the workers and the company is demonstrated through their donations to build the all-marble Columbus Catholic Church in Marble (on Park Street, between West 3rd Street and West 2nd Street). The company was donating the marble and the workers their time to quarry and cut it and build the church. The foundation was laid and a cornerstone ceremony was held in 1912. However, the quarrying stopped in August 1912 when company president Channing Meek died of injuries received from an electric tram accident on the quarry road and his successor did not want to continue the marble donation. Today, much of the foundation is still present as is the cabin across the street to the right.\n\nQuarring techniques had changed since the miners initial quarrying of the mid-1880s with blasting being replaced with equipment to drill and cut. The miners were familiar with explosives plus they did not have the capital for machinery. The machinery reduced waste because blasting damaged a lot of the surrounding marble.\n\nCutting a block involved a channeling machine (consisting of several drill bits and powered by electricity or steam) that made vertical holes from the top down. Next the bottom was cut by drilling horizontal holes. The block was then freed from the mountainside by inserting wedges into the horizontal holes, then inserting feathers until the block broke free. Sometimes in winter, water was poured into the holes so the expansion of the freezing water would break the block loose. Sometimes a wire saw would cut the quarried block inside the quarry into individual blocks before it was lifted out.\n\nLifting out of the quarry required a hole to be made through the block so a cable could be inserted to pull the block away so other cables could be attached for lifting out of the quarry. The lifting was done with wooden derricks above and outside of the quarry or the 50-ton electric hoist if in Quarry 2 (which was Quarry 3 during the boom period of 1905 to 1916).\n\nOnce out of the quarry, a block was moved to a loading station for transport to the mill site. The first method (1906 through 1909) used the 50-ton electric hoist, which lowered the block down and onto a Pea Vine cable-powered cart. The cart then moved on rails with downgrades to 54% to a loading station where the block was transferred to a wagon for towing to the mill site. The wagons were first towed by teams of four horses then in 1908 by a 110-horsepower steam tractor previously used for logging. The road to the mill site was built in the 1890s by John Osgood to his quarry, which was just below the CYMC started quarry. By 1910, the method changed with the 50-ton hoist attaching a block to an overhead cable for lowering to a new loading station. Here the block was placed on a flatcar for towing by an electric tram (designed by General Electric) on standard-gauge railroad track to the town of Marble and into the mill site. Electricity to power the tram came from the CYMC-built hydro-electric plant located just east of the town.\n\nReaching the mill site, the marble went into an expansive finishing mill built by CYMC from 1907 through 1910. At its widest point the mill site was and almost long totaling (the largest finishing mill in the world under one roof). Here the marble was transformed into a variety of objects for shipment throughout the country.\n\nShipment of the finished marble was done by the Crystal River and San Juan Railway (created by CYMC and completed November 1906). Railroad tracks were parallel with the mill site and the marble was rolled on a cart out a mill site building and into the railroad car. In some shops the railroad cars were brought into the shop for loading. The company railroad then transported the marble north to Carbondale, Colorado, where the cars were connected to other railway trains.\n\nMethods for cutting a block can vary depending on the formation and other factors, but usually involve three types of saws (wire and two chain types of which all three are diamond edged). The usual approach starts with a horizontal cut at the bottom after which metal rollers are inserted (on which to move the block away from the mountain after all sides have been cut). Next is the back cut with a wire saw followed by chain saws to cut the vertical sides. A metal bag is then inserted behind the back cut and filled with water, which pushes the block away from the rock face (on the metal rollers). The block is then rigged for lifting by forklift and placed on a haul truck and driven out of the mountain and down to the staging area on the grounds of the old mill site. When the quarry opened in 1990, a tunnel had been blasted through the mountain and into the quarry interior to enable marble to be driven out of the quarry.\n\nThe cutting rates of today are many factors greater than in 1911 when a wire saw was sometimes used before a block was removed. In 1911, such a saw was new technology and had a cut rate of about an hour. A modern wire or chain saw can cut more than in the same time.\n\nBy July 1907 the initial construction of the quarry and the rest of the system was finished but marble was being shipped out before though only in small amounts and advertising pieces. The first major contract came in late October 1907 to supply $500,000 worth of marble for the Cuyahoga County Court House, in Cleveland, Ohio, and set off a quarrying boom. In spite of the increased quarrying, by 1913 the company was in financial trouble due to the huge start-up debt and high operating costs not generating enough revenue to pay down the debt. A loan of $1,868,000 was obtained in early February 1913 and used to refinance to debt. In spite of the financial difficulty orders kept coming in with the first contract of one million dollars for the Equitable Building, New York City, in August 1913 for of marble.\n\nAs the quarry boomed, so did the town reaching its population peak from 1912 through 1914 of 1,400 to 1,500 residents, including a large number of skilled Italian marble worker immigrants with most of them in the mill site. There were two newspapers, three hotels, movie theater, ice cream parlor, five ice houses, and nine stables among other businesses. In January 1910, a movie was premiered in Marble, \"Bear Hunt in the Rockies\" by Edwin Stanton Porter, director of the 1903 landmark movie \"The Great Train Robbery\".\n\nSelecting the marble for the exterior was a competitive process with five samples submitted to the Lincoln Memorial Commission for consideration; three from Georgia (Cherokee, Southern and Amicalola), one from Vermont (Dorset White) and Yule marble. Of the samples, Memorial architect Henry Bacon wanted to use Yule marble in spite of its higher cost because the stones \"whiteness and delicate veining\" placed it \"above any white building marble in appearance that I have seen here or abroad\". The Memorial commission voted to award the marble contract for Yule marble on 26 September 1913 but the matter was not settled. Other bidders raised objections about Yule quality, ability to quarry the needed quantity and its durability. Colonel W. W. Harts, the US Army Engineer Officer in charge of Public Grounds and overseer of the project, commissioned geologist George Perkins Merrill to make a determination. After visiting the quarry, Merrill concluded Yule marble met the needed requirements. Yet Secretary of War Lindsley Garrison called for testing by Bureau of Standards which gave a positive report on the use of Yule marble. He also sent a 17 January 1914 letter to United States Commission of Fine Arts about the use of Yule marble, and a reply was sent five days later that compared to the other marbles submitted for consideration Yule \"fit pre-eminently for a structure of the character of the Lincoln Memorial\". The contract for Yule marble was awarded 14 March 1914.\n\nThe contract was the most expensive and most demanding in the history of Yule marble at $1,080,000. The marble came out of Quarry 3, with the first shipment leaving Marble on 25 May 1914 and the final on 16 June 1916. The high standards resulted in a high rejection rate, yet the contract was completed 5 months ahead of schedule. Only a small amount of the marble quarried ever reached the finishing mill. The amount of rejection is based on summary statements given by the company president J.F. Manning. In June 1914, Manning estimated that a monthly quarrying of would yield to of acceptable marble. In 1915, Manning stated sometimes less than 10% of the quarried marble was shipped to the Memorial site. Once delivered to the mill site, marble blocks for other than the columns were taken to Shop 3 after being sawed into multiple pieces with a wire saw and the gang saws in one of the two mills. The wire saw and 20 of the 30 gangs saws were cutting nothing but Memorial marble 24 hours a day in May 1914. Marble for the 38 columns was offloaded in front of Shop 4. Each column comprised 11 drums and the top piece, with each of the 418 marble drums taking more than 18 hours to fashion.\n\nThe bust came barely one month after the final June 1916 shipment of marble for the Lincoln Memorial when the company went into receivership on 18 July 1916 and ceased operations 15 April 1917. The bust was caused by many factors such as the loss of skilled foreign-born craftsmen who returned to their native country to fight in World War I and a decline in the demand for marble brought about by the war. But the main cause was the huge debt incurred with the development of the integrated operation during 1905-1907. Even though the quarry had received a lot of contracts and some very lucrative, the operation (quarry, mill site and railroad) never made enough profit to pay off the start-up funding. A final disposition of the quarry was not completed until 4 April 1921 due to various groups vying for the assets.\n\nThe town declined rapidly to a population of 50 people in 1920 according to the 1920 Census. The bank closed in 1918 as did the remaining newspaper. The last train left Marble in 1918.\n\nOut of bankruptcy in April 1921, the operation was on a much smaller scale than before the 1917 bust. The amount quarried was greatly reduced and experienced several fluctuations in output and changes in operators. The fortunes of the town also went up and down with the marble fluctuation as reflected by the changes in population by climbing to 600 by 1926, 550 as 1930, then dropping to 175 by 1933 with a rise to 225 from 1939 and into 1941.\n\nThough the quarry was out of bankruptcy in April 1921, quarrying did not resume until April 1922 and with divided ownership. The bankruptcy settlement resulted in the Carrara Company owning the quarry and the tram line to the mill site while Yule Marble of Colorado owned the mill site and the railroad. Both companies realized the need to cooperate and functioned as an integrated operation and later merged into Consolidated Yule Marble Company, 24 April 1924. There were other changes of owner and operators with the Vermont Marble Company, taking over as of November 1928. They in turn formed Yule Colorado Company on 14 December 1928 which continued up to the shut down at the end of 1941.\n\nTomb of the Unknowns marble was quarried in seven pieces for four layers; cap, die, base and sub-base (plinth) from Quarry 3 at below the opening from early in 1930 to January 1931. The cap was quarried on the first try while the base required three attempts. (No data available as to quarrying the plinth). The die was worked by 75 men for one year and three attempts until a 56-ton (55.86 metric) block came out of the quarry in late January 1931. When the block was cut from the mountain it weighed 124 tons (123.69 metric). A wire saw was then brought in to cut the block down to 56 tons (55.68 metric). Because of the weight, Vermont Marble Company sent to the quarry a special derrick that was reinforced and heavily rigged. The initial lift was just enough to clear the quarry floor so the block could hang for 15 minutes while the hoist was inspected for stress. Once out of the quarry, the trip to down to Marble took four days with the die block arriving on the grounds of the mill site on 3 February 1931. On 8 February, the block was shipped to Vermont for cutting to final dimensions and carving the pilasters and bas-relief. The work was completed in September and arrived at Arlington National Cemetery the same month. Assembly started in September but after the base piece was put in place, imperfections were discovered halting the work until a replacement was received. Three attempts were made before an acceptable piece was quarried. In December, the replacement base arrived and the assembly was completed 31 December 1931. This was followed by the carving work on the die block by the Piccirilli Brothers (who also carved the statue of Lincoln for the Lincoln Memorial) under the supervision of Tomb sculptor William Hudson Jones. When the Tomb assembly was completed 9 April 1932, the structure had the following dimensions.\n\nAlthough there was some increased activity in the late 1930s, World War II ostensibly ended it. In 1942 the mill site was taken apart and the railroad tracks removed. A hoped for renewed marble demand did not happen after World War II ended. The quarry sat idle and the interior filled with water.\n\nThe town also declined but had some revival. The marble shutdown and a 1941 flood lead to a population decline to about 30 people and the post office closing in 1943. After the war ended and a 1945 flood, more people moved out leaving only Theresa Herman (the school teacher). The population did revive with 26 registered voters in 1956 increasing to a 2011 year-round population of about 110.\n\nIn 1988, Denver oilman Stacy Dunn and another associate undertook the reopening of the quarry forming the new Colorado-Yule Marble Company. Mr Dunn though was killed in a car accident before the opening. Getting the quarry to operating condition required pumping out millions of gallons of water among other repairs. On 15 September 1990, the first marble block to come out of the quarry since 1941 arrived in Marble. Riding in the truck was Elmer Bair, the 1931 motorman of the lead electric tram that brought down the body block for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in February 1931. But as with the original Colorado-Yule Marble Company 80 years before, the new company went bankrupt in 1997. Since that time there have been several changes of operator.\nSince 1988 Marble Colorado has been the site of annual Sculpting Symposia. These symposia are attended by professional and amateur sculptors from the US and foreign countries. These symposia utilize the marble from this mountain.\n\nToday only a few people of the 110 or so full-time Marble residents make up the 15–20 quarry employees. The town does receive a monthly rent from the quarry company to use part of the old mill site grounds (West 3rd Street and the Crystal River) to store quarried blocks until they are shipped to customers.\n\nShortly after assembly of the Tomb was completed on 9 April 1932, cracks developed in the main block (wreaths, Greek figures and the inscription) and grew longer over time. The cracks were filled in 1974 and 1989. By 1990, the Arlington National Cemetery (ANC) was studying options, including replacing the damaged block. ANC prepared a 15 August 2006 draft memorandum of agreement to replace the damaged marble.\n\nWhile ANC was studying the situation, a donated replacement block was provided by George Haines, a retired entrepreneur and car dealer in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. In September 2002, he read that the quarry crew \"was getting ready to look for and replace the tomb's marble and that the (Veterans Administration) and Arlington were accepting bids on the replacement piece.\" With that he decided to pay the $31,000 for the replacement block. Arlington National Cemetery Superintendent John Metzler requested a letter on the donation and was sent one. Mr Haines also arranged for free transportation to Arlington National Cemetery. In 2003 a prospective block was found and quarrying began. To record the activity, Ron Bailey photographed the event. When the block came free from the mountain, imperfections were found so the block was rejected. The heart of the block was used for a statue of President George H.W. Bush. Another search started with a flawless block quarried and brought down to the storage area in Marble in 2005. Since 2005, the block has remained on the same yellow flatbed trailer in the north-west corner of the storage yard due to replacement opposition. \n\nOpposition to replacing the block had been growing and included such groups as the National Trust for Historic Preservation. On 26 September 2007, the Senate passed the Akaka-Webb amendment to prohibit replacing the cracked Tomb marble. On 26 June 2009, the Army and ANC announced the Tomb would be repaired. The repairs of April 2010 failed after two months and were redone in September 2011. A 21 October 2011 inspection by the Army Corps of Engineers and other experts pronounced the repairs successful.\n\nBecause it is a working mine, casual visitors are not permitted. Marble pieces are available for purchase, however.\n\nA partial list of structures containing Yule marble, 1905 to 1941, from the quarry started by the Colorado-Yule Marble Company. The Colorado state capitol was an 1895 contract with the quarry of John Osgood. The dollar amount after a building name is the amount of marble. Marble ranged from a single item (such as the baptism font now in the Episcopal church in Glenwood Springs, Colorado) to entire exteriors.\n\n\n\n"}

One was sold to Thomas Edison as his first car. Edison also designed the nickel-iron batteries used in some Baker electrics. These batteries have extremely long lives.\n\nIn May 1902, Baker took part in a speed trial on a public road on Staten Island, New York. The vehicle was built specially for racing, having previously raced in Cleveland, and was a streamlined and enclosed 'torpedo' body with a small conning tower and even smaller mica window for the driver. A crew of two were carried, one acting as brakesman whilst W C Baker, the driver, steered. Although carrying two people increased the weight, this was a small matter when the car already weighed , mostly of lead-zinc batteries. The intention was to exceed 60 mph and to cover 'a mile a minute' from a standing start, beating the performance of the more powerful gasoline cars and the 1901 electric record by a Riker of 1:08.\n\nThe Baker was car 39 from the start and set a good time for the first part of the course, but then lost control and slid sideways into the crowd. A number of spectators were injured and two killed. In the aftermath, the Automobile Club of America resolved to stop races on public roads and there was a general loss of confidence in the safety of electric cars.\n\nThe model range was expanded in 1904 to two vehicles, both two-seaters with armored wood-frames, centrally-located electric motors, and 12-cell batteries.\n\nThe Runabout had , weighed , and had a wheelbase of 58-in.The Stanhope cost US$1,600, weighed , had and three-speed transmission. It was capable of .\n\nIn 1906 Baker made 800 cars, making them the largest electric vehicle maker in the world at the time. They bragged that their new factory was \"the largest in the world\" in advertisements. The company also made a switch from producing \"Baker Electric Carriages\" to automobiles. According to the company promotionals; \"We employ the choicest materials in every detail of their construction and finish, producing vehicles which in every minute particular, cannot be equaled for thorough excellence.\"\n\nThe 1906 Baker Landolet was priced at $4,000. The company also manufactured the Imperial, Suburban, Victoria, Surrey, Depot Carriages, and other new models \"to be announced later.\" One of the most unusual 1906 Bakers was the Brougham with the driver on the outside, in the back.\n\nBy 1907, Baker had seventeen models, the smallest being the Stanhope and the largest the Inside Drive Coupe. There was also the US$4,000 Extension Front Brougham with the driving seat high up behind the passengers mimicking a hansom cab. Baker also introduced a range of trucks with capacity of up to five tons in 1907.\n\nIn late 1910, the \"Baker Electric\" was quite luxurious and priced at $2,800. It had a seating capacity of four passengers and was painted black with choice of blue, green or maroon panels. The latest model also offered a Queen Victoria body as \"interchangeable on chassis\" priced at an additional $300.\n\nThe Baker of 1910 was the only electric that had a heavy series-wound motor of 300 percent overload capacity, with a commutator \"absolutely proof against sparking and burning under all conditions.\"\n\n\nThe Baker Motor-Vehicle Company, located at 63 West 80th Street in Cleveland, Ohio, specialized in vehicles for the commercial market. By October 1912, the company had a Commercial Car Department and had dealers situated in several leading cities around the United States.\n\nDuring late 1912, Baker advertised that the average cost for deliveries over the \"steep hills\" of Spokane, Washington, by Crescent Department Store were four cents a piece, including all operating charges, maintenance, interest and depreciation.\n\nBy late 1913, the company advertised their new model as \"The magnificent new Baker Coupe\" and that the car was \"just what the public demanded, a genuine automobile, not an electrically driven coach\". That year, the car had \"increased roominess, full limousine back, longer wheelbase, graceful, low-hung body lines, with both interior and exterior conveniences and appointments which have set a new mark in motor car refinement\". Another new feature were revolving front seats which faced forward or \"turn about\".\n\nIn 1913, Baker was overtaken in sales by Detroit Electric and, in 1914, merged with fellow Cleveland automaker Rauch and Lang to become Baker, Rauch & Lang. The last Baker cars were made in 1916, but electric industrial trucks continued for a few more years. Baker, Rauch & Lang produced the Owen Magnetic under contract.\n\nFounder Walter C.

{"id": "1935988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935988", "title": "Serenity Rose", "text": "Serenity Rose\n\nSerenity Rose is a comic created by Aaron Alexovich (credited as \"Aaron A.\" until the second volume) and published by Slave Labor Graphics. The story follows the life of Serenity Rose, as told by her through diary entries. All three volumes of \"Serenity Rose\" were published online first, starting in 2008, before being made available in print. In 2013, Alexovich started a Kickstarter to publish all volumes in a complete set, which reached full funding in November 2013. The comics in full are still available online.\n\n\"Serenity Rose\" is the story of a young witch named Serenity Rose, also known as Sera. In the lore of the comic, Sera is one of five existing American witches and one of fifty-seven throughout the world. Sera describes the powers of witches in her world, including flight, producing ectoplasmic beings, changing form. The comic follows Sera as a young adult, attempting to find peace in the town of Crestfallen, a town filled with oddities and bizarre creatures, whose residents are drawn to her abilities. Book One, \"Working Through the Negativity\" begins with Sera explaining her therapist told her to keep her thoughts in a diary, but she thinks diaries are stupid, so she decided to make a comic book instead. The first book introduces most of the main characters, including Sera's family, best friends Contessa and Kelton, and her idol, Vicious Whisper. It also delves into her past, repeatedly addressing a traumatic incident in which Sera totaled a bus with her powers in a nervous breakdown. While trying to avoid the company of others, Sera writes a comic called \"Welcome to Statickland\" which she publishes under a pseudonym (though most seem to know it is her). While attending a club in Crestfallen, Sera witnesses clubgoers acting paranormally and responds, causing the destruction of the club. \"Working Through the Negativity\" ends with Serenity meeting Vicious Whisper, a British witch and performer as well as Sera's idol. Vicious offers to teach her how to use her powers, and Serenity accepts.\n\nThe second series, \"Goodbye, Crestfallen!\" begins where the last left off, with Sera experiencing strange dreams and believing she is producing ectoplasm in her sleep. She finds out a witch called Stiletta has been stealing her dreams and using them to conjure monstrosities. One attacks the city of Crestfallen and seriously injures her friend Contessa. Later she is confronted by Stiletta and her controller, a witch called Valentine, who tells Sera Stiletta had been raised in a mine by her grandmother, completely locked away from society, and was behind the events at the club that Sera destroyed. In Stiletta's attempt to kill Sera, Kelton and Contessa intercede, until Sera finds the will to fight and takes Stiletta to the cave where her dream ectoplasm is held. In the end Stiletta takes her own life, and the mysterious witch who brought her to Sera explains that there are always fifty-seven witches on earth, so the next child born will be a witch to take Stiletta's place. Sera tells him to leave Crestfallen. To accommodate her, Vicious floats her home to Crestfallen so she can train Sera there. The art style in the second volume is noticeably different from the first, giving character more realistic proportions and using a sharper black and white style than the first.\n\nThe third volume, \"Break Your Stupid Heart\" opens at a Vicious Whisper concert in Crestfallen, where Sera participated and Vicious used some of her creations from the previous volume in the show. It is the most optimistic opening in the series. While in town, Vicious opens a new restaurant based on a \"water pagoda\" created by a witch long passed. After an argument with Contessa, she reveals to Serenity that many magical elements have \"unlocked\" in Crestfallen and magical creatures in the town are behaving differently. Serenity is met with a childhood friend, Madeline Price. It's discovered that Serenity's nervous break down which caused her to destroy a schoolbus was caused by Madeline yelling at her for not protecting her from bullies. Madeline's family left Crestfallen afterwards, and she describes her life traveling the world and meeting other witches in her reunion with Sera, and how her hand was seriously injured when a bomb exploded in a witch temple, called a Califia. They explored some of the witch-made architecture in Crestfallen, including areas they are not allowed into, including the cave which contains Sera's dream ectoplasm. Madeline reveals that Sera had dreamed up an ectoplasm version of her, that had existed since they were in school together. Madeline followed the ectoplasm copy to the cave, and would come there regularly. The two have an intimate moment until Sera finds out Madeline had been photographing Sera's creations, to benefit a teacher who was injured in the Califia, but was not aided by any of the witches there. This explains Madeline's general distrust of witches aside from Serenity. Sera decides she owes her, and allows her to take the pictures. Trying to tell V what happened, Sera finds out V had hired her assistant, Crawlsie, specifically to try and play matchmaker with the two of them, but before she has a breakdown, Crawlsie convinced her it's not worth staying angry about, and Sera asks her on a date.\n\n\"Vicious Whispers\" was a side comic conceived by Aaron A. where Vicious Whisper would offer advice to reader mail in the form of a regular web comic. The comics were done in two sets, one in 2006, consisting of 22 total comics, and another in 2010, consisting of 27 comics. The comics are done in character, but do not canonically effect or have much to do with the main story.\n\nSerenity \"Sera\" Rose is one of five American witches and the most famous of them. She is very reclusive and shy and despises the attention toward herself. She (like Alexovich) is originally from Chicago. When she was four, her mother died from a mysterious illness. Heartbroken Sera froze part of Lake Michigan in the middle of July, which didn't make the locals too happy. About a month later, Sera's father receives an offer to move to a town in the Pacific Northwest called Crestfallen. The Mayor of Crestfallen offered to give the Roses a large home gratis. Mr. Rose probably didn't realize that he and his daughter had moved to \"The Spookiest Lil' Town in America\" which Sera later called a \"prison zoo\" because the mayor had turned the town into sort of a Horror Disneyland over time. Despite the many offers for Serenity to be an apprentice to other witches, Mr. Rose did not allow it. However Sera didn't mind and was pretty proud that her father had stuck up for her well-being. At fifteen, a witch named Valentine was the latest visitor to attempt to coerce the young witch to leave Crestfallen. Upon her father's advice, Sera rejected this offer too.\n\nA year later, Sera's father was killed in a car accident while trying to avoid crashing into a goblin. Shortly, after his death, The Bus Incident occurred which propelled Sera into national infamy. Accused of hijacking the bus that she was on, the teenage girl was ordered to serve nothing more than counseling with a court-appointed psychologist because she was a witch and that the hijacking may have been caused due to the stress of losing her father. The details of the bus incident are unclear as Sera has blocked those events from her memory. Sera is not even sure that she caused the incident though she accepted the responsibility.\n\nSera generally dresses in gothic attire, but her make-up and blue hair are both put in place by shapeshifting. To her disgust, She is idolized by Crestfallen and refuses every year any invitation to have her join the Halloween parade. Sera has problems with her identity as a witch, her future, and is unsure of her sexuality (and is quite embarrassed by it).\n\nContessa \"Tess\" Rubikov is Serenity Rose's best friend/enemy. They've known each other since Sera first arrived in Crestfallen, and Contessa was the first person to actually treat Sera like a human being, which sparked a friendship. Contessa is six feet tall and has dyed red hair (real hair color is unknown) and thick eyebrows, three tattoos and six piercings. The most noticeable tattoo is that of a happy sun on her shoulder. She has two earrings on each ear and a nose stud; the sixth piercing is a hole she has in her head due to a screwdriver-related \"accident\". She lives with Grandpa Rubikov (real first name unknown). Sera and Tess seem to have an odd like/dislike relationship.\n\nShe enjoys anything related to violence and taunting (and claims to be the town's resident annoyance). She especially likes taunting Tiphané, a goth vampire wannabe. She once stole holy water from St. Tedius to use as fuel for her holy water cannon, which was used—ineffectively—against a real vampire. She had also once made Sera sit through the local Halloween parade, until a large goblin parade-float came to her home after she heavily denied several goblins candy (and she fought back as a large ectoplasm bunny). Tess is also quite hyperactive and silly, and is not a fan of 'spooky-cute' stuff, almost the complete opposite of her best friend. Tess is Sera's only means of vehicle transportation, since Tess has a driver's license. Her car has flames painted on it.\n\nVicious Whisper is described as a Japa-Brit (half Japanese half British) witch and singer whose real name is Victoria Whisper but her friends call her V. Her songs have strong anti-business sentiments attached to them (i.e. \"Napalm on Wall Street\"; these songs seem quite the opposite of her personality) and she normally floats around a stadium with her on tour. Tutored by Ms. Thorpp, another famous English witch, V has had a chance to fully explore what it is like to be a witch and uses her abilities to their full potential. She has met every known witch in the world, including supposedly mythological ones such as Baba Yaga. When she is not on tour she sits and thinks at her secluded home on ectoplasm clouds while drinking peppermint tea. Her hair is a hot pink and almost always up in pigtails. She is the only witch Sera has met, and they gain a master-apprentice relationship by the end of the series.\n\nShe is very kind and quite intelligent, and is often referred to as a perkigoff. V has many philosophies and opinions on life, and hates little. She also has little desire for materialistic things. She also stars in her own webcomic/advice column \"Vicious Whispers\" when Alexovich is busy working on other projects.\n\nDewey Dwayne Kelton, or Kelton as he is referred to throughout most of the story, is a reluctant bassist for a pop punk garage band and publisher for a college zine. Kelton is one of Sera's closer friends, as well as the publisher of her anonymous comics where she uses the alias of Zero when submitting her work. Often viewed as a \"worry-wart\" by his acquaintances, Kelton is cautious and not very aggressive.\n\nHe often comes to Sera's side when she needs it most as a shoulder to cry on and as the worried friend. First introduced in \"Working Through the Negativity\", Kelton has consistently been the comforting guy friend to Sera all the way through the comic's history. Sera and Kelton's relationship remains platonic. When Sera and Tess are not getting along, Kelton is usually there to act as a quiet mediator.\n\nNot much was known about Stiletta until the end of \"Goodbye Crestfallen\" except that she was quite aggressive and almost heartless. She can be easily distinguished by the scars/stitches on her body and the neon yellow hair that covers her right eye which is missing. It is also unclear if Stilletta is her real name as she has gone by various alias such as \"The Blonde Witch\" or \"The Tongue Witch\". Stiletta is believed to have given \"the Curse\" to the singer of a band, which caused the vampire incident in the Darkroom, and attacked Sera in a public bathroom at one point.\n\nIt was speculated that Stiletta was in the employ of Skarsdayle to somehow persuade Serenity into joining Rivet Hed because Skarsdayle's assistant (referred to as \"Chester\" when Serenity visits Rivet Hed) bore a resemblance to Stiletta, and shape shifting may be responsible for the differences. However, in \"Goodbye Crestfallen\", Stiletta was actually Valentine's apprentice. Supposedly, her parents, Theo and Christianne Van Vedeker wanted her to be killed fearing that news that having a witch for a daughter would ruin their company. But her grandmother Willemina Van Vedeker and the reclusive matriarch of the Van Vedeker empire had different plans.\n\nWillemina would hide Stiletta in an abandoned diamond mine in Zimbabwe along with about 8 years of supplies including five children's books, fuel, and cutlery. What happened next could probably be implied. Willemina was possibly killed then left in the cave with Stiletta, thus allowing Theo and Christianne to inherit his mother's fortune. Her presumed death occurred about 17 years before \"Goodbye Crestfallen\". However, Theo and Christianne would not get away with their crimes of greed and abandonment as three years prior to \"Goodbye Crestfallen\" they would be found murdered, possibly by Stiletta.\n\nSix weeks prior to \"Goodbye Crestfallen\", SSI investigators discovered the mine along with many spellcast creatures that Stiletta may have produced. It was revealed at the end of \"Goodbye Crestfallen\" that Stiletta was the twin sister of the diamond heiress Simon Van Vedeker who looks very much like her.\n\nMadeline Price was the girl on the bus that may have triggered the legendary event simply known as \"The Bus Incident\". The Bus Incident in \"Serenity Rose\" has been the MacGuffin element throughout the story especially since Sera has blocked out the majority of the incident from her mind. But what Sera does know is that Maddy was there. Maddy had been taunted and bullied for her sexuality and the students at her high school were far from accepting of her difference, even more so than having a witch go to high school with them. The majority of bullying came from the boys who would call her \"Mad Dog\" and \"dyke\" and throw beer cans at her. But what set her off was when Sera gave Maddy a note explaining how Sera appreciated her. Maddy took the letter the wrong way and thought that Sera gave her the letter to be mean. By that time, Maddy got off the bus and The Bus Incident occurred.\n\nCrawlsie is the bubbly assistant to Vicious Whisper who was hired shortly after Vicious agreed to mentor Serenity. Crawlsie is a fan of the supernatural, though not a witch herself, and has several tattoos, including one dedicated to Serenity. Originally, her and Sera discover that Vicious had hired Crawlsie specifically to play matchmaker with the two of them. In the end, Sera and Crawlsie go on a date, but leave Vicious a message that it was done on their own accord, and she it's \"not all hers\".\n\nValentine goes by many aliases. Evil is probably one of them. His face is not well defined as it is always covered by shadow. His face, however, does have one distinguishing feature: violet swirling tattoos around his eyes. In the first volume of \"Serenity Rose\", Valentine's name is mentioned when Sera underlines a newspaper report discussing the SSI possibly identifying him as an \"unidentified Slavic warlock\". When Sera was 15, Valentine approached Sera and asked her to be his apprentice, Sera's father advised her to say no, which did not please Valentine.\n\nSera's family is composed of Zoe Mirolette, her stepmother, and Mary Ann, her eight-year-old half-sister. Zoe Mirolette is Sera's stepmother. A few years after moving to Crestfallen, Mr. Rose remarried and had a second child (Mary Ann). Zoe is described as British, and is the proprietor of the Mended Wing Inn in Crestfallen. Mary Ann Mirolette is Sera's half-sister. Mary Ann, like most younger siblings, looks up to her big half-sister. She is also not afraid to ask Sera for help. Mary Ann is the few characters that has been seen outside of printed media as she played a supporting role in Aaron Alexovich's short animation \"Good Guys Wear Black\" starring Serenity Rose.\n\nA special taskforce called the Supernatural Shield Initiative (SSI) was formed in 1933 to handle supernatural creatures and people. Human rights groups, as well as witches, have criticized their methods. Merrick used the word \"priests\" to describe members of the SSI.\n\nSome members of the SSI include:\n\nWitches are rare genetic accidents of nature. They are people born with the ability to float and control energy and matter, even capable of shape-shifting. They can heal themselves or others if they are injured and fix complicated objects without any knowledge of their inner-workings. They can create ectoplasm, a malleable goo, that they use essentially to create whatever comes to their mind at the time.\n\nThe Church of Right Thinking is opposed to witches, believing them to be evil. Members of secular society such as Chuck St. Hardwell of \"Bare Knuckles\" argue that witches are dangerous and may not even be considered human.\n\nSome witches include:\n\nAccording to Valentine, there are always exactly 57 witches. When one dies, the very next child born will be a witch.\n\nBlood-sucking creatures whose origins are left to speculation. One rumor is that vampires were created by the Order of Silver—a breakaway sect from the Knights of Templar—and a Slavic warlock in the 13th century. Their intent was to create a plague that only they, with their sacred armaments, could cure. Thus, they would gain fame and power as the only hope against such an epidemic. The idea backfired, and vampires persist today. Vampires have great strength and agility and heal quickly of any wounds not inflicted by silver or flame. They can be hurt by blessed objects and are sensitive to sunlight. When deprived of blood they are reduced to a primal state, trembling with a need known to only the most pathological of drug addicts. The diluted blood of vampires- mixed with that of humans- is used to create a powerful drug called \"The Curse\" in order to recreate the orgasmic feel of bloodlust. Some countries in Central and South America keep vampires captive in order to produce Curse, as it sells for a high price on the black market. Undiluted Curse can turn the user into a full-blown blood-lusting monster.\n\nSmall creatures native to Crestfallen and two other towns. They usually cluster around trolls or tourists and beg for food. They were brought to Crestfallen by the founding coven of witches to act as jesters and messengers. They appear to have no lower lip and large teeth.\n\nLarge, dim-witted giants that were once used to move heavy stones to aid in building. Now they sit and stare, not having much use, and Crestfallen's children enjoy climbing on them.\n\nAggressive creatures that guard the forest around Crestfallen and supposedly only attack non-witches. They have big hairy bodies and a mask-like face.\n\nSpellcast are the name used to describe the ectoplasmic creatures created by witches. Some spellcast are sentient. Most are created to obey orders. However, in rare cases, they are produced by witches without them even knowing it in their sleep or by collecting residual traces of ectoplasm.\n\nFollowing the Kickstarter, Aaron Alexovich stated in an interview that he's working on \"Heartshaped Skull 2.0\" though he did not release any details on the project nor a timeframe.\n\nIn 2014, the Kickstarter collection of the three original volumes was nominated for a Ghastly Award for Best Archival Collection.\n\n\n"}

In 1894, the trio built one of the first gasoline powered vehicles in the United States, at Apperson's Riverside Machine Works. By 1898 the company was producing one new car every two to three weeks, and selling early models for $2,000 (USD). At the end of that year, they relocated the company to a large factory where they designed two additional models. They brought on a larger workforce and increased the production rate to between two and three new cars each (year). From there business began to boom, five cars in 1898, thirty 1899, 192 in 1900 and 240 in 1901. Production increases kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two shifts of workers were needed to keep the factory running at capacity.\n\nHaynes-Apperson automobiles were known for their \"long distance running\" capability.

It was one of the first to take part in automobile racing, beginning in 1897, due to the belief of the company founder, Émile Mors, in racing's technical and promotional benefits. By the turn of the century, automobile racing had become largely a contest between Mors and Panhard et Levassor.\nMors was one of the first automobiles to use the V engine configuration. The Mors 60 horsepower Grand Prix car was powered by a 10-litre V4 side valve engine, with magneto ignition and dry sump lubrication, which could reach 950 rpm. The car had a steel chassis and a four-speed transmission that drove the rear wheels via chain drive, and rear-wheel brakes. In 1902, Mors added pneumatic shock absorbers to their cars, which represented a great leap forward given the quality of the roads and racetracks at the time. With this car, Henri Fournier was able to win the highly significant Paris-Berlin race, with the drive chain breaking immediately afterwards.\n\nMors ended racing in 1908. Plans to return to auto racing were cancelled due to World War I.\nAndré Citroën became chairman of Mors in 1908 and restored the company's viability. In 1925, Citroën bought Mors outright and closed it down, using its factory for the production of his Citroën automobiles.\nThe company produced a number of models which were sold widely in Europe and in the USA. In 1905 these ranged from 2.3 litres to the 8.1 litre 40/52 HP and by 1914 Minerva-built Knight sleeve valve engines replaced side-valve units in the larger cars. Post-1918 only sleeve valve engines were used. Citroën's chevron gears were used for the bevel drive rear axles from 1914 and a unique feature was the Mors patented clutch, which had a contracting band system which replaced the cone clutch used until 1903.\n\nThe marque was resurrected briefly when a few small electric cars were made during World War II by a subsidiary electrical company of Émile Mors.\n\nCentral Automobile Company was the US importer of Mors automobiles in New York, New York in the very early part of the 20th century.\n\nThe 1904 Mors 18 HP was a touring car. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat 4 to 6 passengers and sold for a high US$8000. The vertically mounted water-cooled straight-4, situated at the front of the car, produced 18 HP (13.4 kW). A 4-speed transmission was fitted. The pressed steel-framed car was quite modern, with a cellular radiator (with fan) and a throttle control. The Mors 11 HP sold for US$5000.\n\nThe St. Louis Car Company also manufactured the American Mors. After manufacturing the St. Louis and Kobusch cars, the latter of which looked like a Mors, the St. Louis Car Company acquired an official license, blueprints, and plans from the Parisian factory to manufacture Mors cars in the U.S. After making the American Mors for three years, the company turned to the manufacture of a car of their own design, the Standard Six.\n\n"}
{"id": "1936022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936022", "title": "National Motor Vehicle Company", "text": "National Motor Vehicle Company\n\nThe National Motor Vehicle Company was an American manufacturer of automobiles in Indianapolis, Indiana, between 1900 and 1924. One of its presidents, Arthur C. Newby, was also one of the investors who created the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nThe company first concentrated on electric vehicles but soon began producing gasoline-engined cars. National produced a range of four, six, and twelve-cylinder passenger vehicles, as well as numerous successful racing cars. In 1923, National was merged into Associated Motor Industries, which subsequently went out of business in 1924.\n\nNational's first vehicle was the tiller-steered electric runabout Style A in 1900. The single electric motor was situated at the rear of the car, producing 9 hp (6.7 kW). A 4-speed herring bone transmission was fitted. The reinforced wood-framed car could reach 15 mph (24 km/h). In 1903, the company began producing internal combustion-engined cars with four-cylinder engines made by Rutenber. Electric cars were dropped from production in 1905.\n\nFor 1905, a circular radiator became a styling signature of the National brand. National introduced one of the first six-cylinder engines in the 1906 model range, which remained available until the breakup of the company.\n\nPeak production for National was reached in 1915, with over 1,800 cars produced. For 1916, the company introduced the Highway Twelve, a 12-cylinder engine of the company's own design (costing over $1,900) and changed its name to National Motor and Vehicle Corporation. Curiously, the 6-cylinder engine option was priced higher than the 12-cylinder, perhaps because National outsourced the 6-cylinder to Continental under the \"Continental Red Seal\" moniker.\n\nForced to raise their asking prices to counteract the effects of wartime inflation, National ended up in a higher price range in which they could not compete. For 1920, National dropped their Highway Sixes and Twelves and issued a new model – the Sextet. The Sextet used a Continental side-valve six-cylinder, modified by National engineers with an overhead valve head.\n\nThe company was merged to form Associated Motor Industries in 1922 along with Dixie Flyer and Jackson. Associated was renamed the National Motors Corporation in 1923, and few cars were made until the company ceased production in 1924.\n\nNational had the most enviable and successful career of all of the American pre-World War I race cars. For instance, in 1911, in a combination of road races, speedway races, hill climbs and dirt track races, they won a total of 84 times, came in second 48 times and third 30 times.\n\nThe Elgin National Trophy race as well as the Illinois Trophy was won by a National 6-cylinder in 1911. In 1912, Joe Dawson won the Indianapolis 500 in a National with an average speed of 78.7 mph. This was the first and only time a stock car ever won the Indianapolis 500.\n\n\n"}

It could seat 2 passengers and sold for US $750 ($18,460 in 2007). The flat-mounted water-cooled single-cylinder engine, situated at the center of the car, produced 6 hp (4.5 kW). A 2-speed transmission was fitted. The tubular-framed car weighed 950 lb (431 kg) and used Concord springs.\nIn 1902 Charles B. King and Jonathan Maxwell created the Northern Manufacturing Company, which eventually went on to be the automotive portion of Studebaker and part of which - along with Chalmers - became Chrysler. Maxwell would later become a well-known name as a line of automobiles would bear his name. King would not experience that same level of fame, though he is remembered as the first person to drive an internal combustion car on the streets of Detroit.\n\nThough the automobile industry was in its infancy, both of these men had already compiled a resume of automotive experience. Both had worked for R. E. Olds. King, who had an engineering degree from Cornell and had moved to Detroit in 1891, was the chief designer at Oldsmobile but left the company after the 1901 fire at the plant. Four years after moving to Detroit, he formed the American Motor League to promote good roads. His first car was created in 1896, and was immediately driven on the streets, much to the dismay of other travelers. The new contraption was loud (as were most other vehicles of the time) and disturbed the horse-drawn carriages. Henry Ford's first vehicle was built three months after King's.\n\nMaxwell had produced a single-cylinder 5-horsepower engine which was used to power the new Northern automobiles. The design was similar to that of the Oldsmobile's and with the relatively advanced engine, the vehicles gained a reputation as “Silent Northern.”\n\nIn 1903 the company produced 300 examples of the runabout, and in 1904 expanded their offerings with the introduction of a twin-cylinder Touring model. In 1903, Maxwell was lured away by Benjamin Briscoe, and the Maxwell-Briscoe Motor Company in Tarrytown, New York, was formed. The Maxwell car was introduced in 1905. Maxwell was absorbed into the newly created Chrysler Corporation in 1925.\n\nKing remained at Northern, continually improving the capabilities of the car. A twin-cylinder, shaft drive unit was introduced, followed by a four-cylinder engine in 1906. By 1907, the single-cylinder cars were discontinued. King left Northern in 1908, but by then, the company was in precarious shape. It was soon taken over by the Wayne Automobile Company, which was quickly acquired by E-M-F, which became the automotive portion of Studebaker in 1913.\n\n"}

It sold products under the brand names Orient, Waltham, and Waltham-Orient. The company was founded in 1893, moving to self-propelled vehicles after 1898.\n\nWaltham Manufacturing Company was founded by Waltham businessmen around engineer Charles Herman Metz (1863-1937). Metz encouraged two employees to build a steam car of their own in the company's premises, which led to the Waltham Steam. Metz imported French \"Aster\" engines, and secured the U.S. distributorship for De Dion-Bouton engines. Further, he imported this maker's tricycles and quadricycles. Using De Dion-Bouton patents, WMC started building their own Orient Autogo and \"Orient Autogo Quad\" in 1899.\n\nAn early investor in WMC, Charles A. Coffin (1844-1926), first president of General Electric, ordered an electric prototype in 1898, which didn't go into production. Metz experimented with engines mounted on bicycles. The evolving Orient Aster was one of the very first U.S.-built motorcycles. Metz was assisted by famed French bicycle racer Albert Champion (1878—1927) who arrived in the U.S. around 1899, becoming one of the first professional motorbike racers. Metz is even claimed to have found the expression \"motor cycle\" for his new vehicle, first used in an 1899 advertisement. Further, engines of Metz' design were developed and produced.\n\nWMC's first car was a motor buggy called the Orient Victoriette, followed by two runabouts in 1902 and 1903. About 400 of the earlier model were sold; the younger \"Orient Runabout No. 9\" was not a success with about 50 examples built.\n\nIn 1902, Metz left the company, founding Metz Motorcycle Company and C.H. Metz Company in town soon after. Engineer Leonard B. Gaylor succeeded him at WMC. The same year, Gaylor introduced a very light model with friction drive, sold as the Orient Buckboard. It seated 2 passengers and sold for just US$425, making it the lowest-priced automobile available. The vertically mounted air-cooled single-cylinder engine, situated at the rear of the car, produced . The car had tiller steering, weighed and had a range, though minimal springing and the complete lack of any bodywork made it less than practical for a long journey. In the next years, it was offered in several models (including a diminutive delivery car), got an improved suspension, steering wheel, two chains instead of one belt to transmit the power to the rear wheels, and an optional two cylinder engine. It remained in production until 1907.\n\nPlant superintendent John Robbins left in 1904. He was replaced by Leo Melanowski. At WMC, he also had the position of a chief engineer.\n\nMore conventional cars came in 1905 with front-mounted, water cooled inline 4-cylinder engines of 16 or 20 hp (12 or 15 kW) and chain drive. They were made until 1908. These powerplants were of proprietary design and consisted of four singles mounted on a common crank. Although of good quality, the cars were too expensive to become a success.\n\nMelanowski left in 1906, his position taken by William H. Little. Little developed a small runabout with a V-twin engine and friction drive. Shortly before production started in 1908, WMC got into financial troubles. To avoid bankruptcy, their bank negotiated with Charles Metz. In July 1908, the C.H. Metz Company bought WMC, making Metz owner of the largest automobile manufacture in the U.S. Reorganisations followed in 1909 and 1910, when the C.H. Metz Co. and WMC together were reorganized as the Metz Company.\n\nLittle's small car left became the Metz Two, sold by a completely new marketing in 14 batches and assembled by the customer. It worked, and the company was not only out of debt in less than a year but also sold its huge stock of parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Stearns Company) was an American manufacturer of luxury cars in Cleveland, Ohio marketed under the brand names Stearns and Stearns-Knight.\n\nFrank Ballou Stearns (1879–1955) was an early automotive pioneer who, in 1896, built his first experimental car as a student, aged seventeen, in the basement of the family home. He built a four-cylinder car as early as 1897, but as it did not work properly he instead switched to single-cylinder engines. His father allowed him to proceed and supported him with money and a barn they converted to a machine shop.\n\nThe first production model evolved in 1898; it was a gasoline-fuel buggy-style automobile with a one-cylinder engine (horizontal under the floor), tiller steering, wire wheels, planetary transmission, and chain drive. In the same year, \"F. B. Stearns & Company\" was organized with his partners, brothers Raymond M. and Ralph L. Owen.\n\nAs early as 1901, he introduced a steering wheel instead of the tiller, and advanced to a gasoline runabout with a 4083cc (101ci) one-cylinder engine under the seat bench, and single chain drive. Until then, about 50 cars had been built.\n\nFor 1902, Stearns offered a variety of models, including a touring car model. Equipped with a front-mounted, 24 hp (17.9 kW) water-cooled flat twin and tonneau, and three-speed transmission was fitted. Notably, all vehicle controls were situated on the steering wheel. The armored wood-framed car weighed 2800 lb (1270 kg), seated six passengers, and sold for $3,000.\n\nIn 1904, Stearns had a very European four-cylinder of , with pressed steel chassis, wheelbase of 111 inches (282 cm), and four-speed gearbox, but a distinctly American (\"i.e.\", backward) coil and battery, rather than the magneto typical in Europe. This changed in 1905, when the 32/40 made magneto standard, as wheelbase grew to 118 in (300 cm). Stearns used the slogan \"Runs like A Deer\" in this year.\n\n1905 brought a new car that was again bigger and which provided the only offering from the small Cleveland manufacturer. It was a huge automobile with a four-cylinder L-head engine with a block cast in pairs and mechanical operated side valves delivering 40 HP. Wheelbase of 118 inches (300 cm). It was called the model 32/40 and was available as a very expensive 7-passenger Touring that set a buyer back a hefty $4,150.\n\nStearns introduced a 40/45 four in 1906, with aluminum body panels, tonneau, and windshield, with \"no less than 17 coats of paint\", at a cost of $5,200. This car shared the wheelbase of previous year's 32/40, though the touring body now seated five passengers.\n\n1907 was the last year in which the company offered but one single model. Again, it was a new one, and again, it was the largest and most powerful yet. The 30/60 rode on a 120-inch (3048 mm). It had a massive T-head four-cylinder engine with the cylinder block cast in pairs, displacing 536 c.i. (8783 cc) and delivering 60 HP. There were two body styles available: a Touring with either 5 or 7 seats for $4,500 each, and a 7-passenger Pullman at $4,759.\nBelieved to be the fastest stock automobile of its period, Barney Oldfield won the Mount Wilson hillclimb in a Stearns Six (which was a 45/90 of 12913cc/788ci). In 1910 at Brighton Beach, Al Poole and Cyrus Patschke won a 24-hour race, covering 1253 mi (2016 km) at an average 52.2 mph (84.0 km/h).\n\nThis is 1911 Stearns Model 15/30 Toy Tonneau, Chassis #4683. It has a 4-cylinder, T-head poppet valve engine with T-head configuration with a displacement of 294.2 c.i. (4821 cc), delivering 32 HP. It features a Stearns carburetor and Bosch ignition. Wheelbase is 116 in. (2946 mm). Price when new was US$3,200 or 3,500, depending on source, which put in easily in the luxury class although this was the least expensive of 4 model line for Stearns and Stearns-Knight that year. A Toy Tonneau is an open, light body for 4 or 5 passengers.\n\nThis car was part of the Harrah automobile collection in Reno, NV, in the 1970s.\n\nSoon, however, Stearns turned away from performance. In 1911, the firm began installing Knight sleeve valve engines, marketed under the Stearns-Knight brand name.

Frank Duryea and his brother Charles in 1898 over the affairs of the Duryea Motor Wagon Company. In 1900 Frank went on to form Hampden Automobile and Launch Company (Springfield) where he developed a new automobile and looked for a manufacturer to produce it. J. Stevens Arms and Tool Company, who were about to enter the developing car business, entered into a partnership with Frank and took over the factory of steam car and bicycle maker Overman (car company) (sharing the premises for several months).\n\nStevens-Duryea's first product was a two-cylinder, 5 hp Runabout that sold for $1,200.00 in 1901. No production numbers are known for 1901 but the firm produced 61 cars in 1902 and 483 in 1903. (A 1903 example can be seen at the Gilmore Car Museum in Hickory Corners, Michigan.) By 1904 the runabout, a tube chassis 6 hp (4.5 kW) flat twin buggy runabout victoria, was called the Model L. It had a flat-mounted water-cooled straight-twin engine, situated amidships of the car, four speed gearbox (three forward, one reverse), wire wheels, full-elliptic springs, and tiller steering. Weighing 1300 lb (590 kg), it sold at US$1300. This would be imported to Britain by Joseph Baker, but would not succeed there; in the U.S., it would survive several years. It was joined in 1905 by the US$2500 Model R, an aluminum-bodied, five-seat, 20 hp four with three-speed gearbox and live axle.\n\nThe model line grew in 1906, adding a US$2400 runabout and a US$3300 limousine. There was also the new Big Six, with a huge 9.6 liter six-cylinder motor, seven-seater tulipwood body, weighing 2900lbs. (1315 kg), at US$5000.\n\nIn 1907, both the L and R were dropped, and Stevens-Duryea focused on sixes. The company still put four-cylinder engines in its 1908 Model X and 1909 Model XXX. After 1909, it made only six-cylinder engines. The shortage of skilled labor hampered the company; only some fifty units were sold in 1904, and maximum production did not exceed 100 a year.\n\nBy 1911, a Model Y (40 hp, six-cylinder) vehicle was being sold and forms the basis of Machinery's Reference Guide No. 60 Construction and Manufacture of Automobiles describing what is already almost conceptually indistinguishable from vehicles produced in the early 21st century. A remark in the publication emphasises how this configuration was reached in the preceding six years.\n\nThe 1915 Model D was the company's last new design, an 80 hp (60 kW) 472ci (7740cc) six. It was this year Frank Duryea sold out; production stopped in 1915 because of financial problems and the plant was sold to New England Westinghouse Company. Several former employees bought the name and goodwill and in 1919 restarted production of the D as the Model E, at a stratospheric US$9500 (at a time when a physician might earn US$3000 a year).\n\nA nicely preserved example of a 1914 Stevens-Duryea is on display at the Winery at the Biltmore Estate. George Vanderbilt had purchased a 1913 model, but traded it in for 1914 since the latter had electric rather than oil-burning headlamps.\n\nThis did not improve the company's prospects, and it was purchased by Ray Owen (of Owen Magnetic) in 1923 to produce gas and electric cars under the Rauch and Lang brand, in a factory next to the Stevens-Duryea factory. A new model Stevens-Duryea was announced, the Model G, but this was basically the same as the Model E. After only 28 cars were sold in 1924, manufacture of the Model G continued on an orders received basis until 1927.\n\n\n\n"}

Thomas Motor Company was a manufacturer of motorized bicycles, motorized tricycles, motorcycles, and automobiles in Buffalo, New York between 1900 and 1919.\n\nIn 1896, Edwin Ross Thomas (1850 – 1936) of Buffalo, New York began selling gasoline engine kits for propelling ordinary bicycles. After forming the Thomas Motor Company, he began selling complete motor-assisted bicycles under the name Thomas Auto-Bi. The Auto-Bi is generally considered to be the first production motorized bicycle made in the United States. By 1903, the company was the largest manufacturer of single-cylinder, air-cooled engines. The Thomas Auto-Bi was later joined by the Auto-Tri, a three-wheeled motorcycle, and the Auto-Two Tri, a motorcycle that could hold three riders.\n\nIn 1905, the Thomas Auto-Bi established a new record for a transcontinental crossing of the United States in 48 days. By 1912, the demand for motorcycles had dropped significantly, and the Thomas Motor company discontinued all production of two-wheeled machines.\n\nThe E.R. Thomas Motor Company built automobiles from 1902 to 1919. The first Models were the 1902 Model 17, this was available in either a detachable rear entrance tonneau or runabout, equipped with a single cylinder 8hp and 2 speed planetary transmission. This was followed in January 1903 by the Model 18 with its sliding selective transmission and non-detachable Tonneau with rear entrance or runabout body styles. Both the Model 17 and 18 sold side by side until stocks of the Model 17 were sold out in April-May 1903. The 1904 \"Thomas\" was the first Thomas to bear the \"Flyer\" name a touring car model and was the first multi cylinder vehicle produced by the firm. It was a 3 cylinder with plantery transmission on the earlier cars late change to the trans axle transmission that would continue for many years. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat 5 passengers and sold for US$2500. The vertically mounted water-cooled straight-3, situated at the front of the car, produced 24 hp (17.9 kW). The steel-framed car weighed 1900 lb (862 kg). A modern cellular radiator was used for cooling. An 8 hp (6 kW) tonneau model sold for US$1250. In 1912 the company went into receivership and was purchased by Empire Smelting & Refining Company owner C.A. Finnegan. E.R. Thomas was finally shut down between 1918 and 1919.\n\nA 1907 Model 35 with 4 cylinders and 60 horsepower, dubbed \"Thomas Flyer\", won the 1908 New York to Paris Race, the first and only around-the-world automobile race ever held. The race began in Times Square, New York, on February 12 and covered some , finishing in Paris on July 30, 1908. Six teams started the race (one Italian, one German, three French (De Dion-Bouton, Motobloc, and Sizaire-Naudin), and the American Flyer). Only three of the cars finished, the Thomas Flyer which won, the German Protos, and the Italian Züst. The original intent was to drive the full distance using the frozen Bering Strait to drive across the Pacific Ocean. In the course of the race, the Flyer was the first car to cross the United States taking 41 days 8 hours and 15 minutes, and the first to do so in the winter with George Schuster the first automobile driver to ever make the transcontinental winter crossing of the US. Finishing in 169 days was a remarkable feat, considering the lack of roads and services in 1908. Schuster, the driver, was the only member of the Thomas crew to go the full distance.\n\nThe Flyer survived and was restored to the exact condition it entered Paris on that day by William F. Harrah. It is now on exhibit at the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada. Additional details with numerous photos and videos on the 1908 New York to Paris Race are available at The Great Auto Race of 1908\n\nThe Germans arrived in Paris on July 26, 1908. The American Flyer arrived at the edge of the city on July 30, and initially was not allowed into Paris by police because it had a broken headlamp. A passerby offered the team a bicycle light. With no tools to remove the light, they simply strapped the bike on the Thomas Flyer so they could enter Paris and finish the race.\nIt was later discovered the Protos took some shortcuts on its path and was penalized, so the American team that actually arrived second was declared the official winner of the epic race.\n\n\n"}

It is many cell layers thick and capable of absorbing atmospheric moisture and nutrients, but its main function may lie in protecting the underlying cells against damaging UV rays (Chomicki et al., 2015).\n\nOften, the roots of orchids are associated with symbiotic fungi or bacteria; the latter may fix nutrients from the air. This functionality allows the orchid to exist in locations that provide a reproductive or vegetative advantage such as improved exposure or reduced competition from other plant species.\n\nThe velamen also serves a mechanical function, protecting the vascular tissues in the root cortex, shielding the root from transpirational water loss, and, in many cases, adhering the plant to the substrate.\n\nThe typical orchid root has a stele of comparatively small diameter. It is surrounded by a cortex which is further enveloped by a highly specialized exodermis, most of which at maturity do not contain protoplasm. A few cells, however, are living and allow the passage of water through them. The exodermis is surrounded by velamen, consisting of one to several layers of cells, which can develop root hair under proper environmental conditions.\n\nThe velamen arises from the root tip by division of a special tissue.

{"id": "1936117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936117", "title": "Standard cell", "text": "Standard cell\n\nIn semiconductor design, standard cell methodology is a method of designing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) with mostly digital-logic features. Standard cell methodology is an example of design abstraction, whereby a low-level very-large-scale integration (VLSI) layout is encapsulated into an abstract logic representation (such as a NAND gate). Cell-based methodology — the general class to which standard cells belong — makes it possible for one designer to focus on the high-level (logical function) aspect of digital design, while another designer focuses on the implementation (physical) aspect. Along with semiconductor manufacturing advances, standard cell methodology has helped designers scale ASICs from comparatively simple single-function ICs (of several thousand gates), to complex multi-million gate system-on-a-chip (SoC) devices.\n\nA standard cell is a group of transistor and interconnect structures that provides a boolean logic function (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, inverters) or a storage function (flipflop or latch). The simplest cells are direct representations of the elemental NAND, NOR, and XOR boolean function, although cells of much greater complexity are commonly used (such as a 2-bit full-adder, or muxed D-input flipflop.) The cell's boolean logic function is called its \"logical view\": functional behavior is captured in the form of a truth table or Boolean algebra equation (for combinational logic), or a state transition table (for sequential logic).\n\nUsually, the initial design of a standard cell is developed at the transistor level, in the form of a \"transistor netlist\" or \"schematic\" view. The netlist is a nodal description of transistors, of their connections to each other, and of their terminals (ports) to the external environment. A schematic view may be generated with a number of different Computer Aided Design (CAD) or Electronic Design Automation (EDA) programs that provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for this netlist generation process. Designers use additional CAD programs such as SPICE to simulate the electronic behavior of the netlist, by declaring input stimulus (voltage or current waveforms) and then calculating the circuit's time domain (analog) response. The simulations verify whether the netlist implements the desired function and predict other pertinent parameters, such as power consumption or signal propagation delay.\n\nSince the logical and netlist views are only useful for abstract (algebraic) simulation, and not device fabrication, the physical representation of the standard cell must be designed too. Also called the \"layout view\", this is the lowest level of design abstraction in common design practice. From a manufacturing perspective, the standard cell's VLSI layout is the most important view, as it is closest to an actual \"manufacturing blueprint\" of the standard cell. The layout is organized into \"base layers\", which correspond to the different structures of the transistor devices, and \"interconnect wiring layers\" and \"via layers\", which join together the terminals of the transistor formations. The \"interconnect wiring layers\" are usually numbered and have specific \"via\" layers representing specific connections between each sequential layer. Non-manufacturing layers may also be present in a layout for purposes of Design Automation, but many layers used explicitly for Place and route (PNR) CAD programs are often included in a separate but similar \"abstract\" view. The abstract view often contains much less information than the layout and may be recognizable as a Layout Extraction Format (LEF) file or an equivalent.\n\nAfter a layout is created, additional CAD tools are often used to perform a number of common validations. A Design Rule Check (DRC) is done to verify that the design meets foundry and other layout requirements. A Parasitic EXtraction (PEX) then is performed to generate a PEX-netlist with parasitic properties from the layout. The nodal connections of that netlist are then compared to those of the schematic netlist with a \"Layout Vs Schematic\" (LVS) procedure to verify that the connectivity models are equivalent.\n\nThe PEX-netlist may then be simulated again (since it contains parasitic properties) to achieve more accurate timing, power, and noise models. These models are often \"characterized\" (contained) in a Synopsys Liberty format, but other Verilog formats may be used as well.\n\nFinally, powerful Place and Route (PNR) tools may be used to pull everything together and \"synthesize\" (generate) Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) layouts, in an automated fashion, from higher level design netlists and floor-plans.\n\nAdditionally, a number of other CAD tools may be used to validate other aspects of the cell views and models. And other files may be created to support various tools that utilize the standard cells for a plethora of other reasons. All of these files that are created to support the use of all of the standard cell variations are collectively known as a standard cell library.\n\nFor a typical Boolean function, there are many different functionally equivalent transistor netlists. Likewise, for a typical netlist, there are many different layouts that fit the netlist's performance parameters. The designer's challenge is to minimize the manufacturing cost of the standard cell's layout (generally by minimizing the circuit's die area), while still meeting the cell's speed and power performance requirements. Consequently, integrated circuit layout is a highly labor-intensive job, despite the existence of design tools to aid this process.\n\nA standard cell library is a collection of low-level electronic logic functions such as AND, OR, INVERT, flip-flops, latches, and buffers. These cells are realized as fixed-height, variable-width full-custom cells. The key aspect with these libraries is that they are of a fixed height, which enables them to be placed in rows, easing the process of automated digital layout. The cells are typically optimized full-custom layouts, which minimize delays and area.\n\nA typical standard-cell library contains two main components:\n\nA standard-cell library may also contain the following additional components:\n\nAn example is a simple XOR logic gate, which can be formed from OR, INVERT and AND gates.\n\nStrictly speaking, a 2-input NAND or NOR function is sufficient to form any arbitrary Boolean function set. But in modern ASIC design, standard-cell methodology is practiced with a sizable library (or libraries) of cells. The library usually contains multiple implementations of the same logic function, differing in area and speed. This variety enhances the efficiency of automated synthesis, place, and route (SPR) tools. Indirectly, it also gives the designer greater freedom to perform implementation trade-offs (area vs. speed vs. power consumption). A complete group of standard-cell descriptions is commonly called a \"technology library\".\n\nCommercially available Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools use the technology libraries to automate synthesis, placement, and routing of a digital ASIC. The technology library is developed and distributed by the foundry operator. The library (along with a design netlist format) is the basis for exchanging design information between different phases of the SPR process.\n\nUsing the technology library's cell logical view, the \"Logic Synthesis tool\" performs the process of mathematically transforming the ASIC's register-transfer level (RTL) description into a technology-dependent netlist. This process is analogous to a software compiler converting a high-level C-program listing into a processor-dependent assembly-language listing.\n\nThe netlist is the standard-cell representation of the ASIC design, at the logical view level. It consists of instances of the standard-cell library gates, and port connectivity between gates. Proper synthesis techniques ensure mathematical equivalency between the synthesized netlist and original RTL description. The netlist contains no unmapped RTL statements and declarations.\n\nThe high-level synthesis tool performs the process of transforming the C-level models (SystemC, ANSI C/C++) description into a technology-dependent netlist.\n\nThe placement tool starts the physical implementation of the ASIC. With a 2-D floorplan provided by the ASIC designer, the placer tool assigns locations for each gate in the netlist. The resulting \"placed gates\" netlist contains the physical location of each of the netlist's standard-cells, but retains an abstract description of how the gates' terminals are wired to each other.\n\nTypically the standard cells have a constant size in at least one dimension that allows them to be lined up in rows on the integrated circuit. The chip will consist of a huge number of rows (with power and ground running next to each row) with each row filled with the various cells making up the actual design. Placers obey certain rules: Each gate is assigned a unique (exclusive) location on the die map. A given gate is placed once, and may not occupy or overlap the location of any other gate.\n\nUsing the placed-gates netlist and the layout view of the library, the router adds both signal connect lines and power supply lines. The fully routed physical netlist contains the listing of gates from synthesis, the placement of each gate from placement, and the drawn interconnects from routing.\n\nDesign Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) are verification processes. Reliable device fabrication at modern deep-submicrometer (0.13 µm and below) requires strict observance of transistor spacing, metal layer thickness, and power density rules. DRC exhaustively compares the physical netlist against a set of \"foundry design rules\" (from the foundry operator), then flags any observed violations.\n\nThe LVS process confirms that the layout has the same structure as the associated schematic; this is typically the final step in the layout process. The LVS tool takes as an input a schematic diagram and the extracted view from a layout. It then generates a netlist from each one and compares them. Nodes, ports, and device sizing are all compared. If they are the same, LVS passes and the designer can continue. LVS tends to consider transistor fingers to be the same as an extra-wide transistor. Thus, 4 transistors (each 1 μm wide) in parallel, a 4-finger 1 μm transistor, or a 4 μm transistor are viewed the same by the LVS tool.\nThe functionality of .lib files will be taken from SPICE models and added as an attribute to the .lib file.\n\n\"Standard cell\" falls into a more general class of design automation flows called cell-based design. Structured ASICs, FPGAs, and CPLDs are variations on cell-based design. From the designer's standpoint, all share the same input front end: an RTL description of the design. The three techniques, however, differ substantially in the details of the SPR flow (Synthesize, Place-and-Route) and physical implementation.\n\nFor digital standard cell designs, for instance in CMOS, a common technology-independent metric for complexity measure is gate equivalents (GE).\n\n\nThe standard cell areas in a CBIC are build-up of rows of standard cells, like a wall built-up of bricks \n"}

It was unveiled at the Tempodrom in Berlin in 2005.\n\nThe Exelero was commissioned by Fulda, a German subsidiary of Goodyear, to test their new Carat Exelero tire range. The Exelero was the second vehicle to serve as a one-off show car for Fulda's high performance tire range, the first being the Gemballa Extremo in 1996. In collaboration with Maybach, the initial design of the Exelero was to be influenced by the Maybach SW 38 and built on the platform of the Maybach 57. Another important design stipulation from Fulda was that the car should be able to reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h (217 mph) so that the physical limits of the Exelero tires could be tested. The final design of the Exelero was produced by four students from the Transportation Design School of Pforzheim University of Applied Sciences.\n\nThe Exelero is powered by a twin turbo V12 engine made by the defunct Maybach (now a part of the Mercedes-Benz division of Daimler AG), and mounted at 60º. Each cylinder has 3 valves, and a compression ratio of 9.2:1. The engine produces at 5000 rpm and of torque at 2500 rpm. It is mated to a 5G-Tronic automatic transmission.\n\nThe Exelero has a top speed of 351 km/h (218 mph) and a 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) acceleration time of 4.4 seconds.\n\nThe Exelero has alloy wheels with diameters of 23 inches at the front and the rear. The tires are Fulda Carat Exeleros with codes of 315/25 ZR 23 for both the front and rear. The brakes are vented discs at the front and rear, and the car comes equipped with ABS.\n\nThe main materials used in the construction of the Exelero's interior are dark and red leather, neoprene, glossy black carbon fiber, and aluminum accents. The Exelero has sport seats with red harness-style seatbelts.\nThe Exelero's exterior was Black with a long hood and a chrome grill and fuel cap\n\nThe car is noted for being portrayed in an episode of long-running German show \"Cobra 11\", in which it is used in the ending chase of the episode \"Freundschaft\".\n\nAccording to \"Top Gear\", the vehicle was purchased by rapper Birdman in 2011 for US$8 million. In January 2012, \"Motorvison\" profiled the car, which was then owned by Mechatronik and located in Germany, and reports previous rumors of sale to be unfounded.\n\nJay-Z featured the car in the music video for \"Lost One\".\n\nThe car is also shown in the Japanese anime Nisekoi on its first season's 11th episode as a birthday gift to Chitoge Kirisaki, the daughter of the Beehive Gang boss, by Claude, the guardian of Chitoge.\n\nThe car also featured in an episode on Supercar Blondie's YouTube channel.\n"}

During the war, he switched to Polish, and as a result his major works in ontology went largely unnoticed by the wider world philosophical community.\n\nIngarden was born in Kraków, Austria-Hungary, on February 5, 1893. He first studied mathematics and philosophy at the Lwów University under Kazimierz Twardowski, then moved to Göttingen to study philosophy under Edmund Husserl. He was considered by Husserl to be one of his best students and accompanied Husserl to the University of Freiburg, where in 1918 Ingarden submitted his doctoral dissertation with Husserl as director. The title of his thesis was \"Intuition und Intellekt bei Henri Bergson\" (\"Intuition and Intellect in Henri Bergson\").\n\nIngarden then returned to Poland, where he spent his academic career after obtaining his doctorate. For a long period he had to support himself by secondary-school teaching. In 1925 he submitted his \"Habilitationschrift\", \"Essentiale Fragen\" (\"Essential Questions\"), to Kazimierz Twardowski at Lwów University. This thesis was noticed by the English-speaking philosophical community. In 1933 the University promoted him to professor. He became well known for his work on \"The Literary Work of Art\" (\"Das literarische Kunstwerk. Eine Untersuchung aus dem Grenzgebiet der Ontologie, Logik und Literaturwissenschaft\", 1931).\n\nFrom 1939 to 1941 during the Soviet occupation of Lwów he continued his university activity. After the Operation Barbarossa 1941 under the German occupation Ingarden secretly taught students mathematics and philosophy. After his house was bombed, he continued work on his book, \"The Controversy over the Existence of the World\".\n\nIngarden became a professor at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń in 1945 shortly after the war, but was banned in 1946 because of the Communist government. He then moved to the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, where he was offered a position. In 1949, however, he was banned from teaching due to his alleged idealism, supposedly being an \"enemy of materialism\". In 1957 he was reappointed at the Jagiellonian University after the ban was lifted, and so he went on to teach, write and publish. Ingarden died on June 14, 1970 as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nIngarden was a realist phenomenologist, and thus did not accept Husserl's transcendental idealism. His training was phenomenological; nonetheless, his work as a whole was directed towards ontology. That is why Ingarden is one of the most renowned phenomenological ontologists, as he strove to describe the ontological structure and state of being of various objects based on the essential features of any experience that could provide such knowledge.\n\nThe best known works of Ingarden, and the only ones widely known to English-speaking readers, concern aesthetics and literature. The exclusive focus on Ingarden's work in aesthetics does not reflect Ingarden's overall philosophical standpoint, which is focused on the ideas regarding formal, existential and material ontology set forth in his \"Controversy over the Existence of the World\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During its years of operation, it produced over 427 million gold and silver coins of nearly every American denomination, with a total face value of over US$ 307 million. It was closed during most of the American Civil War and Reconstruction.\n\nAfter it was decommissioned as a mint, the building has served a variety of purposes, including as an assay office, a United States Coast Guard storage facility, and a fallout shelter.\n\nSince 1981 it has served as a branch of the Louisiana State Museum. Damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, after over two years of repairs and renovations, the museum reopened in October 2007.\n\nExhibits include instruments used by some of New Orleans' notable jazz musicians, photographs, and posters, now part of the New Orleans Jazz Museum. The site is also a performance venue for jazz concerts, in partnership with the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park and the private Music at the Mint organization.\n\nThe Louisiana Historical Center is located on the third floor of the building. The center includes collections of colonial-era manuscripts and maps, and primary and secondary source materials in a wide range of media. It is open to anyone with an interest in Louisiana history and culture.\n\nThe New Orleans Mint has been designated a National Historic Landmark, and it is the oldest extant structure to have served as a U.S. Mint. Along with the Charlotte Mint, it is one of two former mint facilities in the U.S. to house an art gallery.\n\nThe rapidly growing United States in the early 1830s experienced a shortage of coins. It is estimated that in 1830 there was one small silver coin (quarter, dime or half dime) per person. Also, production of silver dollars was suspended in 1804 because they were being exchanged for underweight Spanish coins in the West Indies. That left the half-dollar as the largest denomination of circulating coin being minted in the U. S. Foreign coins were being circulated in the U. S. to alleviate the shortage. The Philadelphia Mint had been the only U. S. mint until 1838, when operations began at the first branch mints. \nIn 1832 President Andrew Jackson had vetoed a rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States, an institution which he felt extended credit to northeastern commercial tycoons at the expense of the ordinary frontiersmen of the Old Southwest, a region with which Jackson, a Tennessean, strongly identified. In 1836 Jackson had issued an executive order called the Specie Circular which demanded that all land transactions in the United States be conducted in cash. Both of these actions, combined with the economic depression following the Panic of 1837 (caused partly by Jackson's fiscal policies) increased the domestic need for minted money.\n\nAs a result, in 1835 the U.S. Federal Government established three branch mints: the Charlotte Mint in North Carolina, the Dahlonega Mint in Georgia and the New Orleans Mint. Dahlonega and Charlotte were in gold mining regions and these mints produced only gold coins. New Orleans was selected because of the city's strategic location along the Mississippi River which made it a vitally important center for commercial activity, including the export of cotton from the area's plantations. Large quantities of gold from Mexico also passed through its port annually.\n\nIn the early 19th century, New Orleans, which was the fifth-largest city in the United States until the Civil War, conducted more foreign trade than any other city in the nation. It was also located relatively near to gold deposits recently discovered in Alabama. While the Philadelphia Mint produced a substantial quantity of coinage, in the early 19th century it could not disperse the money swiftly to the far regions of the new nation, particularly the South and West. In contrast to the other two Southern branch mints, which only minted gold coinage, the New Orleans Mint produced both gold and silver coins, and in much greater quantities and total value, which marked it as the most important branch mint in the country until the San Francisco Mint began minting a large monetary value of gold coins in the mid 1850s.\n\nThe Mint's location occupies a prominent place in civic history. It sits at one of the two River corners of the French Quarter, which had been the entire city, or \"Vieux Carré\", of New Orleans. Under French and Spanish rule this location was home to one of the city's defensive fortifications. In 1792 the Spanish governor, Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, erected Fort San Carlos (later Fort St. Charles) here. The fort was demolished in 1821; and the nearby area was later named Jackson Square in honor of Andrew Jackson. As a general in the United States Army, Jackson's leadership had saved the city from invading British forces during December 1814 and through January 8, 1815, the date of the famous Battle of New Orleans, the last significant battle of the War of 1812.\n\nThe Mint building, which was constructed in red brick, was designed by architect William Strickland in the Greek Revival style, like most 19th-century public buildings in the United States. Strickland was a student of the architect Benjamin Latrobe, a disciple of Neoclassicism who had helped design the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Strickland himself, based in Philadelphia, had already designed the Philadelphia Mint building and the Second Bank of the United States, and would design the Charlotte and Dahlonega facilities, making him the architect of the first four U.S. mint buildings. Martin Gordon supervised the building's construction, which was undertaken by Benjamin F. Fox, the master carpenter and joiner, and John Mitchell, the master stonemason and builder.\n\nOn the north façade the mint building features a central projecting Ionic portico, supported by four monumental columns that are flanked at the ends by square pillars. The top of the portico contains a simple entablature, crowned by a flat roof in front of a simple, unadorned pediment. This entrance, which sits on top of a basement story, fronts the rectangular central core of the facility and is flanked by two large wings of multiple bays of rectangular windows. These wings wrap around the central rectangular core to form a \"W\"-shaped structure with two square courtyards at the rear. Balconies framed by iron railings and posts adorn the sections of the building's south façade that adjoin the courtyards. Architectural historian Talbot Hamlin described it thus: \"it has those graceful, original proportions so characteristic of Strickland's work. Even today [1944], condemned to a use so different from that for which it was designed, it remains one of the most distinguished of the earlier buildings of New Orleans.\"\n\nOn the interior, Strickland placed the grand staircase that connects the three levels immediately behind the portico in the central core of the structure. The floor system is composed of fired-clay jack arches supported on steel I-beams, a common feature of warehouses and other long-span structures. On the second floor, many of the larger rooms, which were used for coining and melting, contain ceilings with beautiful high arches supported by the walls and freestanding piers. The smaller rectangular rooms on the second level (and the basement), such as the former superintendent's office, also contain these arched ceilings with a single groin vault. The basement formerly contained the boilers inside a brick cage, but now contain museum exhibits devoted to the minting processes as well as the Coin Vault at the Mint, a coin shop.\n\nStrickland did not take into account the swampy lowland and high water table that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint building has encountered numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its foundation. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to steam power so a smokestack (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.\n\nLess than two years later, Beauregard would rise to national fame as the Confederate general who ordered the April 1861 assault on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, South Carolina, thus beginning the American Civil War. It was during the war that Beauregard would secure his place in American history as one of the Confederacy's most capable generals.\n\nLike any other mint the New Orleans Mint was a factory to make coins. Operations at the New Orleans Mint began on March 8, 1838, with the deposit of the first Mexican gold bullion. The first coins, 30 dimes, were struck on May 7. Until it was taken over by the Confederacy in 1861 it produced many different denominations, all of which were either silver or gold: silver three-cent pieces (1851 only), half dimes, dimes, quarters, half dollars, silver dollars, gold dollars, $2.50 quarter eagles, three-dollar pieces, $5 half-eagles, $10 eagles, and $20 double eagles.\n\nMany interesting characters served at the Mint during the early years of operation. One was John Leonard Riddell, who served as melter and refiner at the Mint from 1839 to 1848, and, outside of his job, pursued interests in botany, medicine, chemistry, geology, and physics. He invented the binocular microscope. He also wrote on numismatics, publishing in 1845 a book entitled \"Monograph of the Silver Dollar, Good and Bad, Illustrated With Facsimile Figures\", and two years later an article by him appeared in \"DeBow's Review\" called \"The Mint at New Orleans—Processes Pursued of Working the Precious Metals—Statistics of Coinage, etc.\" Riddell was not held in high esteem by everyone, however: his conflicts with other Mint employees were well-documented, and at one point he was accused of being unable to properly conduct a gold melt.\n\nThroughout the 19th century the New Orleans Mint was frequently featured in magazines, newspapers and other print publications. Articles discussing and images picturing the Mint, in addition to the one by Riddell noted above, were featured in \"Ballou's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion\", published in Boston, and the widely circulated \"Harper's Weekly\".\n\nThe New Orleans Mint operated continuously from 1838 until January 26, 1861, when Louisiana seceded from the United States. On January 29, the Secession Convention reconvened at New Orleans (it had earlier met in Baton Rouge) and passed an ordinance that allowed Federal employees to remain in their posts, but as employees of the state of Louisiana. On February 5, 1861, during the proceedings of the Convention of the State of Louisiana in New Orleans, the committee appointed by the Convention to take an inventory on February 1, 1861, of public property in the hands of the officers of 'the late' Federal government reported that the Sub-Treasurer's vault at the mint contained $483,983 in gold and silver coins. The National Archives records in Rockville, Maryland, indicate the $483,983 consisted of $308,771 in gold coins and $175,212.08 in silver coins. The only gold coin produced in January, 1861 was the $20 gold double-eagle. This means 15,438 $20 gold coins were minted by the New Orleans Mint during January, 1861. Mint coinage records for the $20 1861-O gold double-eagle indicate only 5,000 $20 gold pieces were minted by the Federal Government in January, 1861. This discrepancy is explained in a Numismatist Journal article.\n\nIn March 1861, Louisiana accepted the Confederate States Constitution and the Confederate government retained all the mint officers. They used it briefly as their own coinage facility. The Confederates struck 962,633 of the 2,532,633 New Orleans half-dollar coins dated 1861. Research suggests that 1861-O half dollars bearing a bisected date die crack (\"WB-103\") and 1861-O half-dollars with a \"speared olive bud\" anomaly (\"WB-104\") on the reverse had been minted under authority of the Confederacy. Confederate officials designed alternate reverse dies which they used to strike their own half-dollars in New Orleans (see image). The exact number of the half-dollar coins struck by the Confederate mint with the alternate reverse is unknown; but only four are known to exist today. One of them, which was sold at auction for a large sum, had once been owned by Jefferson Davis, the only President of the C.S.A.\n\nConfederate minting operations continued from April 1 until the bullion ran out later that month. The staff remained on duty until May 31, 1861. After that the mint was used for quartering Confederate troops, until it was recaptured along with the rest of the city the following year, largely by Union naval forces under the command of Admiral David Farragut.\n\nFor many Southern sympathizers, the Mint soon became a symbol of their hatred for the Union occupation. After U.S. Marines under Farragut had raised the U.S. flag on the roof of the Mint in April 1862, a professional steamboat gambler named William Bruce Mumford ascended the roof and tore the flag down. He ripped the banner into shreds, and defiantly stuffed pieces of it into his shirt to wear as souvenirs. Union General Benjamin Franklin Butler, the military governor of New Orleans (who was soon to be derisively nicknamed \"Spoons\" for allegedly pocketing the silverware of New Orleans citizens arrested for treason against the United States), ordered Mumford executed in retaliation. And so, Mumford was hanged from a flagstaff projecting horizontally from the building on June 7, 1862. Mumford's hanging made national headlines. Jefferson Davis demanded that Butler immediately be executed if captured. The event stuck in the minds of many New Orleanians: eleven years later, in 1873, a visitor to the city named Edward King mentioned it in his description of the structure.\n\nThe mint reopened as an assay office in 1876. Its machinery was evidently damaged during the war, but because of its importance, unlike the mints at Charlotte and Dahlonega, in 1877 U.S. Mint agent James R. Snowden asked the superintendent of the office, Dr. M. F. Bonzano, to report on the condition of the facility for minting. Upon receipt of Bonzano's report, new minting equipment was shipped to New Orleans. The building was refurbished and put back into active minting service in 1879, producing mainly silver coinage, including the famed Morgan silver dollar from 1879 to 1904.\n\nThe refurbishment and recommissioning of the New Orleans Mint was due partly to the fact that in 1878 the Federal government in Washington, D.C. had passed the Bland–Allison Act, which mandated the purchase and coining of a large quantity of silver yearly. The Treasury Department needed additional facilities to do so. It reopened the New Orleans facility primarily to coin large quantities of silver dollars, most of which were simply stored in the building instead of circulated. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed former Mississippi Senator and governor Henry S. Foote the new superintendent of the mint.\n\nDuring this second period of operation, the Mint also struck dimes, quarters, half dollars, $5 half eagles, $10 eagles and, in 1879 only, 2,325 double eagles. It should also be noted that the New Orleans Mint was used by the Federal authorities in 1907 to coin over five and a half million silver twenty-centavo pieces for the Mexican government as part of the American government's program of producing foreign coinage. The New Orleans Mint, whose coins can be identified by the \"O\" mint mark found on the reverse of its coinage, earned a reputation for producing coins of a mediocre quality; their luster is usually not as brilliant as those of other mints, and center areas tend to be flattened and not sharply struck. Thus, well-struck New Orleanian coinage is prized in the numismatic world today.\n\n Men made up the majority of the workers at the mint. They worked such jobs as coiners, melters, pressers, cutters, and rollers. The mint was overseen by a superintendent, who was always male. He was a political appointee whose term usually did not last much longer than the party which held the presidency remained in power.\n\nBut it was also during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint employed forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets to make sure they were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.\n\nThe women worked from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working conditions were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost attention to the scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief from the heat and avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.\n\nBy the early twentieth century, the U.S. Treasury had mints operating in New Orleans, Denver, San Francisco, and the main center in Philadelphia, which more than met the demand for minted money. In 1904, the government ceased the minting of the silver dollar, which accounted for the bulk of the coinage the New Orleans branch had been producing since 1879. In 1909 Treasury officials declined to appropriate funds for the mint's operation, effectively halting subsequent minting activity in New Orleans. In 1911, the New Orleans Mint was formally decommissioned and the machinery was transferred to the main U. S. Mint facility in Philadelphia.\n\nTwenty years later, in 1930, Governor Huey Long would rail against this loss when he ran for the office of U.S. Senator against incumbent Joseph E. Ransdell. In a circular distributed by his campaign to the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy service record in the Senate. Long went on to win the election, although he did not take office until his term as governor expired in 1932. At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.\n\nAfter the mint closed, it performed a variety of functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury as it had been from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a high risk of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.\n\nThe state agreed to save the structure from demolition on the condition that it be renovated and converted to some new purpose within fifteen years. Between 1978 and 1980 this goal was met. Since 1981, the Mint building has functioned as a museum of its coin production history. Additional exhibitions housed in the facility have been devoted to New Orleans Mardi Gras (since moved to the Presbytere building on Jackson Square), jazz music (a large exhibit and research materials previously in the New Orleans Jazz Museum – donated by the N.O. Jazz Club), and Newcomb Pottery. All three phenomena have contributed to New Orleans' fame.\n\nOn the third floor, the Mint houses an archive of maps and documents, including French and Spanish colonial records. Along with the Cabildo, the Presbytere, the 1850 House, and Madame John's Legacy, this facility is one of five branches of the Louisiana State Museum in the French Quarter.\nThe Mint building is located at 400 Esplanade Avenue, not far from the Mississippi River.\n\nThe mint building suffered significant roof damage from the hurricane. Water entered the building and came into contact with approximately 3% of the New Orleans Jazz collection, portions of which were removed and cared for at Louisiana State University, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and the Louisiana State Archives.\n\n\n\n"}

Supplemental routes were various roads within the state which the Missouri Department of Transportation was given in 1952 to maintain in addition to the regular routes, though lettered routes had been in use from at least 1932. The four types of roads designated as Routes are:\n\nSupplemental routes make up (59%) of the state highway system.\n\nPrior to 1907, all road improvement activities in Missouri were undertaken by the individual counties, with little expertise or coordination between them. Amid growing automobile presence and insufficient road networks in Missouri in the ensuing years, the state legislature created a state highway department and the state highway commission as well as enacted various laws aimed at improving transportation in the state. In 1920, recognizing that economic prosperity and growth are highly related to good transportation, the legislature passed a $60 million bond issue for road work. This effort, along with the Centennial Road Law passed by the legislature in 1921, shifted highway building efforts in Missouri from the local level to the state level. As a result, the state highway commission undertook an aggressive road building campaign throughout the 1920s and 1930s aimed to \"Get Missouri out of the mud\".\n\nIn 1952, the state highway department embarked on its Missouri 10-Year Highway Modernization and Expansion Program. Through this effort, the state assumed maintenance responsibility of over an additional of secondary and farm-to-market roads previously managed by the counties. The goal of the secondary highway system was to place state-maintained roads within of more than 95% of all rural farm houses, schools, churches, cemeteries and stores. Most of Missouri's lettered supplemental highways are the result of this program.\n\nThe more major supplemental routes of the system are ones assigned with single-letter designations (such as \"K\"). Minor branch routes and farm-to-market roads, which often end at county roads or are former alignments of the other highways, are typically assigned with two-letter designations consisting of two of the same letter (e.g. \"KK\"). Additionally, combinations of letters may be used, but always with A as the first letter (such as \"AD\"); the only exception of this is on Route BA in western St. Louis County. Combinations beginning with the letter R are also used for routes that connect with state parks or other recreational facilities, which is the only use of R on the system; Route AR, a non-recreational route south of Bakersfield, is the only exception to this.\n\nThe vast majority of the highways in the system are designated with 19 letters of the alphabet. The letters \"G\", \"I\", \"L\", \"Q\", and \"S\" are not used because of the potential confusion with other letters and numbers. The only current use of X is on Route AX in Macon County. \n\nThese routes rarely run for more than a few miles, although they may cross county lines. At a U.S. Route or Interstate highway, they change their letters; for example, in Greene County, southbound Route J crosses U.S. Route 60 and becomes Route NN, and Route M in Cole County becomes Route J after passing U.S. Route 50. But when Route MM (Greene County) crosses Route 360, it remains Route MM, only changing into Route B when crossing Interstate 44. Route J in Boone County is one of the few exceptions to this, as it continues past U.S. 40 for three miles before becoming Route O upon passing I-70. The names are also reused, but not near one another. Rarely is a letter re-used in a county; there are two Route Z's in Randolph County and two route K's in Carter County. Route D exists in the counties of Cole, Greene, Newton, St. Louis, and several others.\n\nSupplemental routes are signed by black letters on a white background with a black border. Rarely, the shields will be marked with banners such as EAST, WEST, or END. There are no business or bypass routes for the roads; however, seven examples exist of spur routes: Spur Route N in Cedar County, Spur Route C in Gentry County, Spur Route C (to Union Covered Bridge State Historic Site) in Monroe County, Spur Route K (into East Lynn) in Cass County, Spur Route AA (to the Sappington Cemetery State Historic Site) in Saline County, Spur Route J (to Sigsbee) in Shelby County, Spur Route V in Butler County, and Spur Route Y in Montgomery County.\n\nIt is erroneously believed that due to these roads being designated by letters rather than numbers and their existing in more than one county that these roads are county roads, not state highways, with some businesses and residences located on these roads saying their address is \"County Road A\" for example. This may have also arisen from the signage used prior to the early 1960s, where the letter was painted black against a white background, with the words \"STATE ROAD\" above the letter and the county name (in all capital letters) below the letter.\n\n"}

{"id": "1936152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936152", "title": "Stockholm archipelago", "text": "Stockholm archipelago\n\nThe Stockholm archipelago () is the largest archipelago in Sweden, and the second-largest archipelago in the Baltic Sea (the largest being across the Baltic in Finland). Part of the archipelago has been designated as a Ramsar site since 1989.\n\nThe water has a pH value of 7.0 (neutral) or slightly lower, to be compared with approximately 8.0 for seawater. Together with humic substances this sometimes causes a bit brownish water colour, especially in the inner parts. The salinity varies between freshwater and brackish water with poor salinity. In the outer parts of the archipelago, the salinity reaches around 0.6–0.7 per cent by weight, to be compared with at least 1.5 for beginning to taste salty and around 3.0 or more for proper oceanic water. Sea ice is regularly formed in the inner parts every winter.\n\nThe archipelago extends from Stockholm roughly to the east. In a north–south direction, it mainly follows the coastline of the Södermanland and Uppland provinces, reaching roughly from Öja island, south of Nynäshamn, to Väddö, north of Norrtälje. It is separated from Åland by a stretch of water named South Kvarken. A separate group of islands lies further north, near the town of Öregrund. Between Arholma and Landsort there are approximately 24,000 islands and islets. Some of the better-known islands are Dalarö, Finnhamn, , Grinda, Husarö, Ingarö, Ljusterö, Möja, , Rödlöga, Tynningö, Utö, Svartsö and Värmdö.\n\nThe biggest towns of the archipelago, apart from Stockholm, are Nynäshamn, Vaxholm and Norrtälje. The village of Ytterby, famous among chemists for naming no fewer than four chemical elements (erbium, terbium, ytterbium and yttrium), is situated on Resarö in the Stockholm archipelago.\n\nThe shipping routes from the Baltic to Stockholm pass through the archipelago. There are three main entrances suitable for deep-draught craft, namely, those near Landsort, Sandhamn, and Söderarm.\n\nThe Stockholm archipelago is a joint valley landscape that has been shaped – and is still being shaped – by post-glacial rebound. It was not until the Viking Age that the archipelago began to assume its present-day contours. The islands rise by about three millimeters each year. In 1719 the archipelago had an estimated population of 2,900, consisting mostly of fishermen. Today the archipelago is a popular holiday destination with some 50,000 holiday cottages (owned mainly by Stockholmers). The Stockholm Archipelago Foundation, dedicated to the preservation of the nature and culture of the archipelago, owns some 15% of its total area.\n\nThe inhabitants in the archipelago, from around the mid-1400s to the end of the second world war, were combined farmers and fishermen. Spring and autumn fishing was quite intensive in the outer archipelago from 1450 until the mid-1800s, and many fishermen lived for long periods in the outer islands because of the long distances to their permanent houses in the inner archipelago. The combined farming and fishing culture lasted until around 1950–1955 when the younger generation, born during and directly after the war, started to leave the archipelago and look for jobs in the cities on the mainland. Today most of the small farms on the islands are closed and the fishing industry has almost disappeared.\n\nMany poets, authors and artists have been influenced and fascinated by the Stockholm archipelago. Among them are August Strindberg, Ture Nerman, Roland Svensson, Ernst Didring and Aleister Crowley. Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson from the group ABBA wrote most of their songs in a cabin located on the archipelago.\n\nBoating is an extremely popular activity with the sailing race Ornö runt (or Around the island of Ornö) being the largest in the archipelago. This annual race, organised by the Tyresö Boat Club, has taken place every year since 1973. It is open to anyone with a sailing boat but requires registration. There are different entry classes, with the family class being the least competitive.\n\nIn the winter skaters make excursions over the ice.\n\nVisiting the larger islands in the archipelago is easy all year round, but during winter period the routes depend on the ice conditions. Several companies have regular routes. The largest ship owner company is Waxholmsbolaget owned by the Stockholm County government. Taxi boats are also available. In summer the archipelago bristles with private boats filled with people who often take advantage of \"Allemansrätt\" (or \"everyman's right\"), a law which gives anyone the right to go ashore or anchor on any ground not in the direct vicinity of buildings.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This led to him becoming a local punk promoter during the mid-late 80's, bringing bands such as , Amebix, Antisect, Negazione, AntiCimex, Disorder, Bannlyst, Heresy, Icons of Filth, Anti System, Conflict, Concrete Sox, The Varukers and many others to various Coventry venues, such as the back room of The Hand & Heart public house on Far Gosford Street. During this time he was a passionate animal rights activist and involved in various anarchist groups and demonstrations.\n\nIn 1987 he became vocalist and lyricist with Napalm Death, recording one and a half albums with them, namely the second side of \"Scum\" and the whole \"From Enslavement to Obliteration\" album. During his time in the band, they were majorly championed by John Peel and recorded two sessions for his Radio One show. The band also made several significant TV appearances on BBC shows such as Snub TV, Arena and children's music show What's That Noise? They also appeared on the front cover of NME, which was the inspiration to the lyrics of a song \"\"No Mental Effort\"\". This track appeared on Dorrian's final recording with Napalm Death, on the Mentally Murdered EP. To coincide with its release in 1989, friend Peel had helped to arrange a slot for them at Reading Festival. Unfortunately, the appearance had to be cancelled as Dorrian left the band due to disillusionment following their tour of Japan in July of that year.\n\nWhilst still a member of Napalm Death, Dorrian founded his own record label, Rise Above Records in 1988. Initially intended as a means to get him off the dole, Rise Above was kick-started as part of the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. His main aim was to release a few hardcore punk 7\" singles in extremely limited runs, just for fun. However, the label went from strength to strength and is today one of the most revered underground independent record labels in existence. Some of the artists that Dorrian has introduced to the world via Rise Above Records include Ghost, Electric Wizard, Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats, Circulus, Blood Ceremony and many more.\n\nLater in 1989, Dorrian formed doom metal band Cathedral, releasing their debut album Forest of Equilibrium in 1991. The album is considered a genuine cult classic and a cornerstone in the evolution of the genre. Cathedral existed as a band for over 23 years before deciding to call it a day in 2012, ahead of releasing their final album The Last Spire in 2013. During their lengthy career, they played as main support to Black Sabbath on their Cross Purposes tour in 1994. As a result, the band became friendly with Tony Iommi, which led to him making a very rare guest appearance on Cathedral's 1995 album The Carnival Bizarre.\n\nIn 1995, Dorrian collaborated with Italian musician , with whom he co-wrote four songs which appeared on the Alkahest album. He appeared as vocalist/lyricist in extreme doom project Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine, featuring members of Sunn O))) and Iron Monkey, releasing the one-off album 'Rampton' in 2002. In 2003, he appeared on the Probot album, which was curated by his old friend and former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl.\n\nDorrian is currently a member of With the Dead, in which he is joined by former Electric Wizard bassist Tim Bagshaw, along with former Cathedral bassist Leo Smee and former Bolt Thrower drummer Alex Thomas. Their self-titled debut album was released on Rise Above Records in October 2015.\n\nDorrian first used an extreme and ferocious death grunt style of vocal mixed with hardcore screaming in Napalm Death, but later adopted a cleaner and more varied style with Cathedral.\n\nHe presented an award to Napalm Death at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards 2007.\n\nLee Dorrian has appeared on the British television show Never Mind the Buzzcocks as a guest in the line-up round. The round followed a short video segment of Dorrian performing with Napalm Death.\n\nHe cited among others Cal from Discharge and Sakevi Yokoyama from GISM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was published by Fantasy Flight Games.\n\nFantasy Flight Games published the \"Nocturnum\" trilogy of adventures over three years as \"Long Shades\" (1997), \"Hollow Winds\" (1998) and \"Deep Secrets\" (1999). They were all modern-day \"Call of Cthulhu\" adventures, as opposed to the core game's 1920s setting, and introduced a new mythos race and set it against a darker, more conspiratorial background.

A museum details the history of this period, as well as the French colonial presence beginning in the late 17th century. The fort was partially modernized for the Spanish–American War. It is a tourist destination with tours and historical reenactment events. The site is considered to be one of the nation's best-preserved Civil War era masonry forts and has been nominated for listing as a National Historic Landmark.\n\nSignificant masonry damage had been sustained during hurricanes and tropical storms in the past decade. Though this damage has been largely repaired, the fort continues to be under threat from erosion. The fort sits on the east end of Dauphin Island, only feet from the Gulf of Mexico. Ongoing erosional losses of sand dunes and beach total up to 10 feet per year. For these reasons, the Civil War Preservation Trust placed Fort Gaines on its \"History Under Siege\" listing on March 18, 2009.

The systems use discs called PVDs (which stands for Personal Video Disc), which can store about 30 minutes (half an hour) of video, the length of an average TV show with commercials (a typical TV episode is about 20–23 minutes without them), so each PVD contains only one episode, with trailers at the end to use the leftover time on most PVDs, including Nickelodeon PVDs. Video data is stored on the left audio channel with audio on the right channel, thus making it impossible to achieve stereo sound on the system, which only plays mono. The video plays at about 15 frames per second. Most of the shows were from Nickelodeon, such as \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" and \"The Fairly OddParents\", and later they released shows from Cartoon Network, such as \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\" and \"Dexter's Laboratory\". A small amount of movies were also released on the system, but due to the limited space on a PVD, said movies would have to be released on at least three discs, depending on the length of said film. \nHasbro also produced editing software for creating custom VideoNow Color PVDs called the VideoNow Media Wizard in 2005, which came with blank PVD media.\nA number of unofficial solutions are available for creating the oddly-formatted VideoNow files, including a plug-in for the popular video processing program Virtual Dub. The files can then be burned to a CD-R using standard CD burning software, and the disc cut down to the required size.\n\nAs the VideoNow Color does not accept standard 8 cm mini-CDs, some creative users have resorted to cutting down standard 12 cm CD-R discs, though not without problems. Hasbro made recordable PVDs available without the Media Wizard from their online store.\nHowever, at least one video has been posted on YouTube showing how VideoNow Color players can be easily modified to accept standard-sized CDs with a bit of cutting and gluing. Full-sized CDs can hold roughly 42 minutes of total video, and play with no difference in the modified player.\n\nBecause VideoNow uses video discs, and that has very little if any skip protection, it is more prone to skipping if the VideoNow is touched, bumped, or shaken while playing a PVD.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1936310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936310", "title": "Two-line element set", "text": "Two-line element set\n\nA two-line element set (TLE) is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the \"epoch\". Using suitable prediction formula, the state (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy. The TLE data representation is specific to the simplified perturbations models (SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8 and SDP8), so any algorithm using a TLE as a data source must implement one of the SGP models to correctly compute the state at a time of interest. TLEs can describe the trajectories only of Earth-orbiting objects. TLEs are widely used as input for projecting the future orbital tracks of space debris for purposes of characterizing \"future debris events to support risk analysis, close approach analysis, collision avoidance maneuvering\" and forensic analysis.\n\nThe format was originally intended for punch cards, encoding a set of elements on two standard 80-column cards. This format was eventually replaced by text files with each set of elements written to two 70-column ASCII lines. The United States Air Force tracks all detectable objects in Earth orbit, creating a corresponding TLE for each object, and makes publicly available TLEs for many of the space objects on the website Space Track, holding back or obfuscating data on many military or classified objects. The TLE format is a \"de facto\" standard for distribution of an Earth-orbiting object's orbital elements.\n\nA TLE set may include a title line preceding the element data, so each listing may take up three lines in the file. The title is not required, as each data line includes a unique object identifier code.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Max Lane developed mathematical models for predicting the locations of satellites based on a minimal set of data elements. His first paper on the topic, published in 1965, introduced the Analytical Drag Theory, which concerned itself primarily with the effects of drag caused by a spherically-symmetric non-rotating atmosphere. Joined by K. Cranford, the two published an improved model in 1969 that added various harmonic effects due to Earth-Moon-Sun interactions and various other inputs.\n\nLane's models were widely used by the military and NASA starting in the late 1960s. The improved version became the standard model for NORAD in the early 1970s, which ultimately led to the creation of the TLE format. At the time there were two formats designed for punch cards, an \"internal format\" that used three cards encoding complete details for the satellite (including name and other data), and the two card \"transmission format\" that listed only those elements that were subject to change. The latter saved on cards and produced smaller decks when updating the databases.\n\nCranford continued to work on the modelling, eventually leading Lane to publish \"Spacetrack Report #2\" detailing the Air Force General Perturbation theory, or AFGP4. The paper also described two simplified versions of the system, IGP4 which used a simplified drag model, and SGP4 (Simplified General Perturbations) which used IGP4's drag model along with a simplified gravity model. The differences between the three models were slight for most objects. One year later, \"Spacetrack Report #3\" was released, included full FORTRAN source code for the SGP4 model. This quickly became the \"de facto\" standard model, both in the industry as well as the astronomy field.\n\nShortly after the publication of \"Report #3\", NASA began posting elements for a variety of visible and other well known objects in their periodic \"NASA Prediction Bulletins\", which consisted of the transmission format data in printed form. After trying for some time to convince NASA to release these in electronic form, T.S. Kelso took matters into his own hands and began manually copying the listings into text files which he distributed through his CelesTrak bulletin board system. This revealed a problem in NASA's checksum system, which traced back to the lack of the plus character (+) on the teletype machines used at NASA, which ultimately turned out to be a problem from the punch card era that occurred when NORAD updated from the BCD to EBCDIC character set on the computer sending out the updates. This problem went away when Kelso began to receive data directly from NORAD in 1989.\n\nThe SGP4 model was later extended with corrections for deep space objects, creating SDP4, which used the same TLE input data. Over the years a number of more advanced prediction models have been created, but these have not seen widespread use. This is due to the TLE not containing the additional information needed by some of these formats, which makes it difficult to find the elements needed to take advantages of the improved model. More subtly, the TLE data is massaged in a fashion to improve the results when used with the SGP series models, which may cause the predictions of other models to be less accurate than SGP when used with common TLEs. The only new model to see widespread use is SGP8/SDP8, which were designed to use the same data inputs and are relatively minor corrections to the SGP4 model.\n\nOriginally there were two data formats used with the SGP models, one containing complete details on the object known as the \"internal format\", and a second known as the \"transmission format\" that was used to provide updates to that data.\n\nThe internal format used three 80-column punch cards. Each card started with a card number, 1, 2 or 3, and ended with the letter \"G\". For this reason, the system was often known as the \"G-card format\". In addition to the orbital elements, the G-card included various flags like the launching country and orbit type (geostationary, etc.), calculated values like the perigee altitude and visual magnitude, and a 38-character comments field.\n\nThe transmission format is essentially a cut-down version of the G-card format, removing any data that is not subject to change on a regular basis, or data that can be calculated using other values. For instance, the perigee altitude from the G-card is not included as this can be calculated from the other elements. What remains is the set of data needed to update the original G-card data as additional measurements are made. The data is fit into 70 columns and does not include a trailing character. TLEs are simply the transmission format data rendered as ASCII text.\n\nAn example TLE for the International Space Station:\n\nThe meaning of this data is as follows:\n\n\n\nWhere decimal points are assumed, they are leading decimal points. The last two symbols in Fields 10 and 11 of the first line give powers of 10 to apply to the preceding decimal. Thus, for example, Field 11 (-11606-4) translates to -0.11606E-4 (−0.11606×10).\n\nThe checksums for each line are calculated by adding all numerical digits on that line, including the line number. One is added to the checksum for each negative sign (-) on that line. All other non-digit characters are ignored.\n\nFor a body in a typical low Earth orbit, the accuracy that can be obtained with the SGP4 orbit model is on the order of 1 km within a few days of the epoch of the element set. The term \"low orbit\" may refer to either the altitude (minimal or global) or orbital period of the body. Historically, the SGP algorithms defines low orbit as an orbit of less-than 225 minutes.\n"}

{"id": "1936356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936356", "title": "Tippmann A-5", "text": "Tippmann A-5\n\nThe A-5 is a semi-automatic pneumatic marker made by Tippmann for playing paintball. Inspired by the look and feel of the Heckler & Koch MP5K submachine gun, it was first produced in 2002 in the USA. It utilizes a loading concept called the \"Cyclone Feed System\".Tippman A5 is the fully loaded model in the Tippman arsenal and cost more due to all of the built in features that come standard. Tippman guns they are reliable, rugged and dependable. With the built it cyclone feed the marker really has a feature that is unique in paintball. To get the same performance from a hopper on any other gun would require an electronic hopper, which adds considerably to the cost.\n\nThe standard A5 is a semi-automatic, open bolt blow-back operated, sear-trigger paintball marker. Its inline blowback gas system can utilize both CO and HPA propellants. Standard marker includes single-finger trigger, 8.5 in (216 mm) ported barrel, front and rear sights, tournament-legal velocity adjuster, opaque black 200-round wide-mouth hopper and Cyclone-Feed System.\n\nAutomatic (A-5 with E-Grip only)\n\nTippmann A-5s use a special paintball feed mechanism called the Cyclone-Feed System. It is similar to electric loaders in that it increases the rate at which the paintball marker can feed balls into the chamber.\n\nWhereas most markers have a feed tube attached to a hopper/loader that either drops paintballs one-by-one or force-feeds (in the case of some loaders) into the chamber, the Cyclone-Feed System is a housing on the right side of the marker. Contained within the housing are two star-shaped sprockets. Paintballs fall from a wide mouth hopper into the gaps between the spokes. As the operator fires, excess gas from the firing cycle is routed to a cylinder, which holds a piston. Gas pressure pushes the piston forward, also compressing a spring which will return the piston when the gas pressure in the cylinder drops; at far end of its travel, the piston is connected to a ratchet which interacts with a toothed gear, the advancement of which on the piston's \"return\" stroke [important because it regulates the force with which the paintballs are struck by the spokes] rotates the position of the spokes counterclockwise and feeds a paintball into the chamber. This effectively means that the rate at which paintballs are being fed into the marker is dependent on the rate at which the operator pulls the trigger. Users have reported speeds in excess of 25 bit/s, but this requires mechanical modification to the stock cyclone parts. It is advertised at 15+ bps.\n\nThe A-5 is one of the most modifiable paintball markers in existence. Some products are performance upgrades, while others are purely aesthetic. Kits available at many stores and websites can allow the A-5 to resemble many real-world firearms \"(see Appearance)\"\n\nSome of the many upgrades include:\n\n\nThe upgrades available from Tippmann specifically for the A-5 include the CAR Stock, Response Trigger, E-Grip, Low-Pressure Kit, Expansion Chamber, Universal Mount, 98 to A-5 Barrel Adapter, Remote Line, Sniper Barrel (12\", 14\", 16\" lengths), Camouflage Graphics Kit, Longbow Stock (with or without air-thru), Dogleg Stock (with or without air-thru), Double Trigger Kit and Flatline Barrel System.\n\nThe Flatline barrel is a curved paintball barrel. The slight \"S\"-shaped curvature, in addition to a roughly honed surface at select points in the barrel, creates topspin on the ball which increases its range by 100+ feet over a standard barrel. Some players feel that it is not quite as accurate as many other paintball barrels, because each paintball is spun differently. Another disadvantage some players claim is its tendency to break paintballs more easily. This can be remedied with higher quality paint, however. The Flatline is also quite loud, due to lack of porting.\n\nUnfortunately, Flatline Barrels are sometimes considered difficult to remove and clean, though it has been said that the A5 is much easier over the version used by the Tippmann 98 Custom. On the 98 Custom model, they do not screw into the adapter on the muzzle of the marker; three bolts must be loosened before the barrel can be removed.\n\nThe Flatline is often favored by players who like to play farther back roles, especially those providing suppressive fire as the range gives them an advantage.\n\nThe E-Grip is an aftermarket pistol grip and trigger for the Tippmann A5, though the model A-5 with E-Grip can be bought directly from Tippmann. There are two types of electronic triggers now available.\n\nThere is the older and significantly harder to find Tippmann produced E-Grip. It features five different fire selections which include:\n\nThe maximum firing rate of the E-Grip is 20 balls-per-second. Firing modes are very easily selected by means of a screw which is rotated to toggle modes. Maximum rate of fire can also be changed via another screw on the grip frame.\n\nThere is also the newer E-Grip produced by Wicked Air Sports (W.A.S). This is what is commonly sold now by Tippmann in their E-Grip package. This trigger will also be installed an all A-5 markers ordered with the E-Grip installed. Firing modes on the W.A.S. trigger are:\n\nThe \"Three\" in the \"Three Shot Ramping\" and \"Three Shot Full Auto\" programming modes refers to the trigger needing to be pulled three times before the Full Auto or Ramping are activated. The first three shots in this will be Semi Automatic. This makes the trigger legal for certain competitions.\n\nProgramming the W.A.S. trigger is more difficult. There is a menu system that is controlled by the pressing both trigger and a small button on the front of the grip that can only be pressed with a tool. There is a small three color LED that outputs data by different patterns of blinking and LED color.\n\nThe trigger can be programmed more deeply than the older Tippmann E-Grip. Maximum firing rate is 30 balls-per-second but is usually programmed much lower. Dwell and Debounce is also programmable.\n\nThe W.A.S. board is also used in the Tippmann 98 line of paintball markers. However the polarity of the microswitch is reversed. Polarity can be changed by referring to the owners manual. The same board can be used in both markers.\n\nThe Response Trigger System is a firing system available for the A-5. The system uses a series of parts that are added to the marker to greatly increases firing rate for the marker. The system uses excess carbon dioxide or compressed air from the firing process to reset the trigger and sear with a pneumatic cylinder. The system can reset the trigger with only moderate pressure on the trigger. When this happens, the pressure of the finger can immediately pull the trigger back, creating \"bounce\", and firing again. This effectively gives the shooter the ability to fire at fully automatic speeds. As such, it has been banned at some commercial paintball fields.\n\nContinuing the Tippmann tradition, the A-5 is very durable and features a solid cast-aluminum receiver with a high-impact shock absorbing endcap. The Tippmann A5 can take much abuse as all parts are tough. The exceptions to this are the Cyclone-Feed System and the Response Trigger Kit, which both have lines that snake along the receiver and can be snagged easily.\n\nThe grip/trigger assembly, back plate and bottom-line hose (or direct Air Source Adapter) are held to the receiver by four push-pins that can be easily removed to allow easy field stripping.\n\nUnlike previous Tippmann markers, the A-5 is very easy to field-strip and clean. Tippmann says it can be field stripped in about 60 seconds. This is done by removing four push-pins which hold the tombstone, endcap and grip frame in place.\n\nTo field strip an A-5 marker:\n\nNote: Be sure to clean any residual paint from the hopper area. If it builds up, it can increase the chance of chopping a ball in the future. Q-tips work good for cleaning the hopper area. Also remember to thoroughly clean the barrel.\n\nThe Tippmann A-5 uses an inline blowback system.\n\nBefore gassing, cock the marker by pulling back the cocking handle (located near the front of the marker on the left side of the receiver). This pulls back the front and rear bolts and allows access to chamber while also ensuring that the valve is not being depressed by the rear bolt when the propellant supply is screwed in, which would result in a leak. A click should be heard. Release the cocking handle.\n\nScrew a propellant supply (CO, N or HPA) tank onto receiver or remote coil. Operator should hear a sound as marker becomes pressurized.\n\nPress the manual-feed button (located to the right of the receiver, on the Cyclone-Feed System) and check Cyclone-Feed System for proper rotation of sprockets. It should be clean and free of debris.\n\nAttach a compatible hopper to the marker by placing the mouth-end (male) of the hopper into the Cyclone-Feed housing (female) and turning hopper until tab on mouth locks into corresponding hole in feeder housing. Hopper should be parallel with marker.\n\nOpen hopper flap and fill with paintballs (up to 200 for standard hopper). Close flap until it snaps onto hopper mouth.\n\nPull back on the cocking handle located on the opposite side of the marker from the cyclone feeder (this is only required once each time a propellant bottle is connected). Press the manual-feed button to force a paintball into the chamber.\n\nDisengage safety by pressing the 'Push Fire' button located above the trigger on the right side of the grip frame. A red line on the left side of the button indicates when marker is ready to fire.\n\nIn 2015 Total Paintball Gear announced new upgrade kits and parts.\n\n"}

In a conventional miniature game, players purchase the miniatures they want and generally invest time in assembling, painting, and often customizing the figures to their liking. CMGs were designed to appeal to those who would enjoy the game aspect but not necessarily the hobby aspect of miniature gaming.\n\nCMGs tend to cover a more diverse range of topics than traditional wargames (which generally are fantasy, sci-fi, or historical in theme), and certain games, such as Dreamblade are even somewhat abstract in nature.\n\nDue to the random distribution of figures when purchasing CMG products, a large secondary market has sprung up selling single miniatures, as well as websites that allow players to trade spare figures.\n\nPerhaps the most popular and well-known CMG to date is HeroClix, which allows players to create battles between characters from the Marvel and DC Comics comic book universes, as well as certain smaller publishers.

{"id": "1936401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936401", "title": "Fort Morgan (Alabama)", "text": "Fort Morgan (Alabama)\n\nFort Morgan is a historic masonry pentagonal bastion fort at the mouth of Mobile Bay, Alabama, United States. Named for Revolutionary War hero Daniel Morgan, it was built on the site of the earlier Fort Bowyer, an earthen and stockade type fortification involved in the final land battles of the War of 1812. Construction was completed in 1834 and it received its first garrison in March of the same year.\n\nFort Morgan is at the tip of Mobile Point at the western terminus of State Route 180 (Alabama). It and Dauphin Island, on which Fort Gaines is situated, enclose Mobile Bay. The Alabama Historical Commission maintains the site.\n\nAfter the departure of the Spanish from Mobile in April 1813, the Americans built an earth and wood redoubt on Mobile Point, ultimately naming it Fort Bowyer after Col. John Bowyer, who completed the construction before leaving in 1814. In September 1814 the fort withstood a British naval and land attack, known as the First Battle of Fort Bowyer. The British returned in February 1815 after their defeat at the Battle of New Orleans and again launched an attack that became known as the Second Battle of Fort Bowyer. This time they were successful, with its American garrison surrendering the fort. Before the British could continue their attack towards Mobile they received word that the Treaty of Ghent, ending the war, had been signed on Christmas Eve, 1814. When word of the treaty's ratification arrived shortly thereafter, the British withdrew. The site was a logical one for a more substantial fort that could defend itself from landward and protect the entrance to the bay, leading to Fort Morgan replacing Fort Bowyer.\n\nAfter the War of 1812, the U.S. began a program to strengthen its seacoast defenses. As part of this program, in 1818 the U.S. contracted with Benjamin Hopkins of Vermont to build a large masonry fort on Mobile Point after a design by Simon Bernard, who had been a military engineer for Napoleon. However, Hopkins died a year later in a yellow fever epidemic, having accomplished little. The next contractor, Samuel Hawkins of New York, died in 1821, before accomplishing anything on the project. The Army turned the task over to the Corps of Engineers under Capt. R.E. De Russey. Using slave labor, DeRussey was able to make some progress before he took ill in 1825 and turned the work over to his deputy, Lieut. Cornelius Ogden. Ogden completed the work in March 1834 and turned the fort over to Capt. F.S. Belton, commander of Company B, 2nd US Artillery. This unit remained at the fort for about a year and a half before its transfer to Florida to assist in the Second Seminole War.\n\nEight days before Alabama seceded from the Union, Col. John B. Todd took four companies of Alabama volunteers and captured the fort before dawn on 3 January 1861. The Confederates then proceeded to strengthen the defenses of Mobile Bay. The key point was the Main Ship Channel opposite Fort Morgan as this was the only approach where the water was deep enough to permit major warships to pass. To defend this area, the Confederates placed 18 of the fort's heaviest guns (including two 7-inch Brooke rifles and two British-made 8-inch Blakely rifles), so that they could bear on the Channel. They also built redoubts and trenches east of the fort to impede further any attack via land. Lastly, they complemented the land defenses with a small flotilla consisting of the ram , and three gunboats, , and , all under the command of Admiral Franklin Buchanan.\n\nDuring the war, Fort Morgan provided protective fire for blockade runners. All 17 vessels that ran out of the Bay eluded capture, as did 19 of the 21 that attempted to enter. Union soldiers were observed in the Sand Island Lighthouse, spying on Fort Morgan, and the fort fired on the position destroying the lighthouse.\n\nDuring the Battle of Mobile Bay, Union naval forces under Admiral David G. Farragut were able to get past Fort Morgan and enter the Bay. They captured \"Tennessee\" and \"Selma\", sank \"Gaines\", and captured Fort Gaines. This freed the Union land forces under Gordon Granger to besiege Fort Morgan. During the siege, the wooden roof of the Citadel, a ten-sided barracks located in the center of the fort used to house the enlisted men, caught fire and the structure was badly damaged. Rather than restore it, post-War crews used the ruins as a brick source for repairing the fort. The remains of the Citadel were razed in the 1880s for use as a breakwater. After two weeks of bombardment from sea and land, Major Richard L. Page, commander of the fort, felt compelled to surrender. He did so on August 23, 1864, after first spiking the fort's guns. \nOnce the fort was in Union hands, the Union used it as a base for reconnaissance raids, and then as a staging area for the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakely, which occurred days before General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox.\n\nDuring a renovation project in the 1870s, the fort received 12 200-pounder Parrott rifled cannons. Eventually, however, the US Government abandoned the fort, letting it fall into disrepair. Then under the presidency of Grover Cleveland, Secretary of War William Endicott chaired the Endicott Board, which led to a program of building new, concrete batteries. Between 1895 and 1900, Fort Morgan received five concrete batteries, supported by the latest in fire control, electricity, and communications.\n\nThe first battery, Battery Bowyer, was operational during the Spanish–American War. It had four 8-inch breech-loading guns on disappearing carriages. The battery was closed in 1917 and the guns removed for conversion to railway guns for service in Europe.\n\nAt the beginning of the Spanish–American War, Fort Morgan also received eight 10-inch smooth-bore muzzle-loading Rodman cannons, converted to 8-inch rifles with the insertion of a barrel sleeve. This was a makeshift and the Army later gave the guns away to cities for Civil War memorials.\n\nThe second battery, completed in 1900, was Battery Dearborn, named for Major General Henry Dearborn. The battery had eight breech-loading 12-inch coast defense mortars in two four-gun pits. The intent was that should enemy vessels approach, the mortars would rain down shells on the vessels' less heavily armored decks.\n\nThe third battery, also completed in 1900, was Battery Duportail, named for Major General Louis Duportail. Its armament consisted of two 12-inch breech-loading rifles on disappearing carriages. The battery was decommissioned in 1923. The Army removed the breechblocks and plugged the breeches before abandoning the guns in place. The Army scrapped the guns in the early 1940s.\n\nThe fourth battery was Battery Thomas, named for Captain Evan Thomas, who had been killed in the Battle of Sand Butte in 1873 during the Modoc War. This battery's armament consisted of two British 4.7-inch rapid-fire Armstrong guns. The battery's role was to prevent smaller enemy vessels from passing through the ship's channel in front of the fort. The battery was deactivated in 1917 and its guns removed.\n\nThe fifth battery was Battery Schenk, named for Lieutenant William T. Schenck, who was killed in action in Luzon in 1900 during the Philippine–American War. The battery initially held two, later increased to three, 3-inch rapid-fire guns. It too protected the ship channel.\n\nHurricanes in 1906 and in July 1916 caused a great deal of damage to the wooden houses at Fort Morgan along Officer's Row. The wide porches that helped cool the buildings in summer proved particularly vulnerable.\n\nIn 1915, the Coast Artillery Corps built an experimental battery, called Battery Test, about a mile away from Fort Morgan. The battery held a single 10-inch gun on a disappearing carriage. Then in 1916, the Navy had two battleships, the and the , shell the battery for two days to see how well it would survive, which it did with remarkably little damage. The gun was removed shortly after the tests.\n\nAfter the US declared war on Germany in April 1917, the fort took on the task of training men of the Coast Artillery in modern weapons. The fort also trained field anti-aircraft batteries. In 1920 the fort received four British 9.2-inch howitzers. These guns were abandoned and later scrapped in 1924 when the Army abandoned the fort. Thereafter, the base deteriorated quickly.\n\nDuring World War I, the Army had established a radio transmitting and receiving station at Fort Morgan as a part of a nationwide Morse-code communication network. The transmitter had the call letters WUR. When Fort Morgan was abandoned, the call letters were transferred to Fort McClellan, Alabama.\n\nIn April 1942, the Army re-occupied the fort and constructed an adjacent airfield. Initially, the Coast Artillery brought five Model 1918 155mm (6.1-inch) guns to equip the fort. The Army placed two on top of Fort Morgan on mounts that permitted 360 degrees traverse. The remaining three guns stood on the fort's parade ground.\n\nThe War Department turned Fort Morgan over to the State of Alabama in 1946, and the Army again abandoned the fort in 1947. The War Department disbanded the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps itself in 1950.\n\nFort Morgan was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.\n\nIn 2007 it was listed as \"one of the nation's 10 most endangered battle sites\" by the Civil War Preservation Trust in \"History Under Siege: A Guide to America's Most Endangered Civil War Battlefields\".\n\nIn June 2008, a 90-pound live Union naval shell was uncovered at the site. The shell was from a Parrott rifle on a U.S. Navy warship and was fired at the fort in the summer of 1864. The discovery came during excavations as part of a project meant to repair cracks in the walls.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1936419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936419", "title": "Human parainfluenza viruses", "text": "Human parainfluenza viruses\n\nHuman parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are the viruses that cause human parainfluenza. HPIVs are a paraphyletic group of four distinct single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the \"Paramyxoviridae\" family. These viruses are closely associated with both human and veterinary disease. Virions are approximately 150–250 nm in size and contain negative sense RNA with a genome encompassing about 15,000 nucleotides.\nThe viruses can be detected via cell culture, immunofluorescent microscopy, and PCR. HPIVs remain the second main cause of hospitalisation in children under 5 years of age suffering from a respiratory illness (only \"Human orthopneumovirus\" causes more respiratory hospitalisations for this age group).\n\nThe first HPIV was discovered in the late 1950s. The taxonomic division is broadly based on antigenic and genetic characteristics, forming four major serotypes or clades, which today are considered distinct viruses. These include:\nHPIVs belong to two genera: \"Respirovirus\" (HPIV-1 & HPIV-3) and \"Rubulavirus\" (HPIV-2 & HPIV-4).\n\nhPIVs are characterised by producing enveloped virions and containing single stranded negative sense RNA. Non-infectious virions have also been reported to contain RNA with positive polarity. HPIV genomes are about 15,000 nucleotides in length and encode six key structural proteins.\n\nThe structural gene sequence of HPIVs is as follows: 3′-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5′ (the protein prefixes and further details are outlined in the table below).\n\nWith the advent of reverse genetics, it has been found that the most efficient human parainfluenza viruses (in terms of replication and transcription) have a genome nucleotide total that is divisible by the number 6. This has led to the \"rule of six\" being coined. Exceptions to this rule have been found and its exact advantages are not fully understood.\n\nElectrophoresis has shown that the molecular weight (MW) of the proteins for the four HPIVs are similar (with the exception of the phosphoprotein, which shows significant variation).\n\nViral replication is initiated only after successful entry into a cell by attachment and fusion between the virus and the host cell lipid membrane. Viral RNA (vRNA) is initially associated with nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P) and the large protein (L). The hemagglutinin–neuraminidase (HN) is involved with viral attachment and thus hemadsorption and hemagglutination. Furthermore, the fusion (F) protein is important in aiding the fusion of the host and viral cellular membranes, eventually forming syncytia.\n\nInitially the F protein is in an inactive form (F) but can be cleaved by proteolysis to form its active form, F and F, linked by di-sulphide bonds. Once complete, this is followed by the HPIV nucleocapsid entering the cytoplasm of the cell. Subsequently, genomic transcription occurs using the viruses own 'viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase' (L protein). The cell's own ribosomes are then tasked with translation, forming the viral proteins from the viral mRNA.\n\nTowards the end of the process, (after the formation of the viral proteins) the replication of the viral genome occurs. Initially, this occurs with the formation of a positive-sense RNA (intermediate step, necessary for producing progeny), and finally, negative-sense RNA is formed which is then associated with the nucleoprotein. This may then be either packaged and released from the cell by budding or used for subsequent rounds of transcription and replication.\n\nThe observable and morphological changes that can be seen in infected cells include the enlargement of the cytoplasm, decreased mitotic activity and 'focal rounding', with the potential formation of multi-nucleate cells (syncytia).\n\nThe pathogenicity of HPIVs is mutually dependent on the viruses having the correct accessory proteins that are able to elicit anti-interferon properties. This is a major factor in the clinical significance of disease.\n\nThe main host remains the human. However, infections have been induced in other animals (both under natural and experimental situations), although these were always asymptomatic.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 5 million children with lower respiratory infections (LRI) each year in the United States alone. HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 have been linked with up to a third of these infections. Upper respiratory infections (URI) are also important in the context of HPIV, however, they are caused to a lesser extent by the virus. The highest rates of serious HPIV illnesses occur among young children, and surveys have shown that about 75% of children aged 5 or older have antibodies to HPIV-1.\n\nFor infants and young children, it has been estimated that about 25% will develop \"clinically significant disease\".\n\nRepeated infection throughout the life of the host is not uncommon and symptoms of later breakouts include upper respiratory tract illness, such as cold and a sore throat. The incubation period for all four serotypes is 1 to 7 days. In immunosuppressed people, parainfluenza virus infections can cause severe pneumonia, which can be fatal.\n\nHPIV-1 and HPIV-2 have been demonstrated to be the principal causative agent behind croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), which is a viral disease of the upper airway and is mainly problematic in children aged 6–48 months of age. Biennial epidemics starting in Autumn are associated with both HPIV-1 and 2; however, HPIV-2 can also have yearly outbreaks. Additionally, HPIV-1 tends to cause biennial outbreaks of croup in the Fall. In the United States, large peaks have presently been occurring during odd-numbered years.\n\nHPIV-3 has been closely associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia and principally targets those aged <1 year.\n\nHPIV-4 remains infrequently detected. However, it is now believed to be more common than previously thought, but is less likely to cause severe disease. By the age of 10, the majority of children are sero-positive for HPIV-4 infection which may be indicative of a large proportion of asymptomatic or mild infections.\n\nImportant epidemiological factors that are associated with a higher risk of infection and mortality are those who are immuno-compromised and may be taken ill with more extreme forms of LRI. Associations between HPIVs and neurologic disease are known; for example, hospitalisation with certain HPIVs has a strong association with febrile seizures. HPIV-4B has the strongest association (up to 62%) followed by hPIV-3 and -1.\n\nHPIVs have also been linked with rare cases of virally caused meningitis and Guillain–Barré syndrome.\n\nHPIVs are spread from person to person ('horizontal transmission') by contact with infected secretions through respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces or objects. Infection can occur when infectious material contacts mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth, or nose, and possibly through the inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or cough. HPIVs can remain infectious in airborne droplets for over an hour.\n\nOverall, HPIVs remain best known for its effects on the respiratory system and this appears to be where the majority of the focus has been upon.\nThe inflammation of the airway is a common attribute of HPIV infection. It is believed to occur due to the large scale up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. Common cytokines, expected to be up-regulated, include IFN–α, various other interleukins (IL–2, IL-6) and TNF–α. Various chemokines and inflammatory proteins are also believed to be associated with the common symptoms of HPIV infection.\n\nRecent evidence seems to suggest that virus-specific antibodies (IgE) may be responsible for mediating large-scale releases of histamine in the trachea, which are believed to cause croup. More detail on the pathways and interactions can be found here.\n\nThe body's primary defense against HPIV infection remains humoral immunity. This is mainly directed against surface proteins which can be found on the virus. In particular the proteins HN and F prove to be most immunogenic in terms of stimulating the immune system.\n\nRecently the importance of the 'cell mediated immune system' has been scrutinized. Reports have shown that those with defective adaptive immune responses are at a higher risk of severe infection.\n\nDiagnosis can be made in several ways, encompassing a range of multi-faceted techniques:\n\n\nBecause of the similarity in terms of the antigenic profile between the viruses, hemagglutination assay (HA) or hemadsorption inhibition (HAdI) processes are often used. Both complement fixation, neutralisation and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays – ELISA, can also be used to aid in the process of distinguishing between viral serotypes.\n\nMortality caused by HPIVs in developed regions of the world remains rare. Where mortality has occurred, it is principally in the three core risk groups (very young, elderly and immuno-compromised). Long term changes can however be associated with airway remodelling and are believed to be a significant cause of morbidity. The exact associations between HPIVs and diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are still being investigated.\n\nIn developing regions of the world, preschool children remain the highest mortality risk group. Mortality may be a consequence of primary viral infection or secondary problems such as bacterial infection. Predispositions, such as malnutrition and other deficiencies may further elevate the chances of mortality associated with infection.\n\nOverall, LRI's cause approximately 25–30% of total deaths in preschool children in the developing world. HPIVs is believed to be associated with 10% of all LRI cases, thus remaining a significant cause of mortality.\n\nNumerous factors have been suggested and linked to a higher risk of acquiring the infection, inclusive of malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, absence of breastfeeding during the early stages of life, environmental pollution and overcrowding.\n\nDespite decades of research, no vaccines currently exist.\n\nRecombinant technology has however been used to target the formation of vaccines for HPIV-1, -2 and -3 and has taken the form of several live-attenuated intranasal vaccines. Two vaccines in particular were found to be immunogenic and well tolerated against HPIV-3 in phase I trials. HPIV-1 and -2 vaccine candidates remain less advanced.\n\nVaccine techniques which have been used against HPIVs are not limited to intranasal forms, but also viruses attenuated by cold passage, host range attenuation, chimeric construct vaccines and also introducing mutations with the help of reverse genetics to achieve attenuation.\n\nMaternal antibodies may offer some degree of protection against HPIVs during the early stages of life via the colostrum in breast milk.\n\nRibavirin is one medication which has shown good potential for the treatment of HPIV-3 given recent in-vitro tests (in-vivo tests show mixed results). Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral, and is currently being administered to those who are severely immuno-compromised, despite the lack of conclusive evidence for its benefit. Protein inhibitors and novel forms of medication have also been proposed to relieve the symptoms of infection.\n\nFurthermore, antibiotics may be used if a secondary bacterial infection develops. Corticosteroid treatment and nebulizers are also a first line choice against croup if breathing difficulties ensue.\n\nParainfluenza viruses last only a few hours in the environment and are inactivated by soap and water. Furthermore, the virus can also be easily destroyed using common hygiene techniques and detergents, disinfectants and antiseptics.\n\nEnvironmental factors which are important for HPIV survival are pH, humidity, temperature and the medium within which the virus is found. The optimal pH is around the physiologic pH values (7.4 to 8.0), whilst at high temperatures (above 37 °C) and low humidity, infectivity reduces.\n\nThe majority of transmission has been linked to close contact, especially in nosocomial infections. Chronic care facilities and doctors' surgeries are also known to be transmission 'hotspots' with transmission occurring via aerosols, large droplets and also fomites (contaminated surfaces).\n\nThe exact infectious dose remains unknown.\n\nIn the poorest regions of the world, HPIV infection can be measured in terms of mortality. In the developed world where mortality remains rare, the economic costs of the infection can be estimated. Estimates from the US are suggestive of a cost (based on extrapolation) in the region of $200 million per annum.\n\n\n"}

Visibility was so limited that streetlights remained lit throughout the day and motorists needed their headlights to navigate city streets.\n\nSmoke pollution had been a problem in St. Louis for many decades prior to the event, due to the large-scale burning of bituminous (soft) coal to provide heat and power for homes, businesses and transport. In 1893, the Council passed an ordinance prohibiting the emission of \"thick grey smoke within the corporate limits of St. Louis\" but was unable to enforce it because of failed legal action taken against Heitzberg Packing and Provision Company, one of the worst corporate offenders. The effectiveness of laws was also limited by the lack of adequate inspection and enforcement. In 1933, the mayor, Bernard F. Dickmann, created a \"citizen smoke committee\" and appointed his personal secretary Raymond Tucker to take charge of efforts to improve air quality.\n\nEarly efforts had relied on education such as teaching people how to build cleaner fires – but this had almost no impact. It was soon realized that real improvement would only come about by switching to a cleaner fuel – gas, oil, coke, or anthracite were all considered but ruled out on cost grounds. The alternative was to wash and size the existing soft coal to make it burn hotter and cleaner, and ensure that all coal sold in St. Louis was of this variety. In February 1937 a smoke ordinance was passed creating a \"Division of Smoke Regulation in the Department of Public Safety\", forcing larger businesses to burn only clean coal and setting standards for smoke emission and inspection. By 1938 emissions from commercial smokestacks had been reduced by two-thirds.\n\nDespite some improvement, smoke pollution was still a visible problem since the new law did not cover smaller businesses and domestic users – 97% of homes still used coal. The city council was reluctant to pass further legislation that might alienate voters so the mayor's \"enforcer\", Tucker, was limited to using persuasion through the press and radio broadcasts. One newspaper in particular, the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", became notable for its campaign to persuade residents of the benefits of switching to cleaner forms of coal.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday, November 28, 1939, a meteorological temperature inversion trapped emissions from coal burning close to the ground, resulting in \"the day the sun didn't shine\". A cloud of thick black smoke enveloped St. Louis, far worse than any previously seen in the city. The day came to be known as \"Black Tuesday\". The smog hung about for nine days over the course of the following month. This proved to be the catalyst that forced the council's hand. New cleaner, affordable supplies of coal (semi-anthracite) were quickly secured from Arkansas in time for the next winter. This, together with a new smoke ordinance, improvements to the efficiency of furnaces and the ongoing public education campaign resulted in a significant and permanent improvement in air quality in the city.\n\n\n\n"}

Gant is currently a co-host on WAGA-TV's morning news program \"Good Day Atlanta\".\n\nGant joined the 30–30 club (at least 30 stolen bases \"and\" 30 home runs in the same season) in 1990 and 1991, while with the Braves. He batted and threw right-handed.\n\nGant was born in Victoria, Texas to George Gant, a chemistry professor, and Alice Hardeman, a special education teacher. Gant played football and baseball in high school. He was recruited heavily to play college baseball for such schools as Texas and Oklahoma but turned down scholarship offers to go pro after high school.\n\nGant was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the fourth round of the 1983 MLB draft (100th overall), and joined the Braves in as a September call-up, after winning the Bill Lucas Award as the Braves' Minor League Player of the Year in 1986. He collected 22 hits in 83 at bats, including two home runs. During the season, the rookie Gant was an everyday player for the struggling Braves, who finished with a record of 54–106. After a disappointing sophomore season in Gant was sent down to the minor leagues to learn how to play the outfield, Gant returned to form and the starting line up in , when he batted .303 with 32 home runs and 84 RBI, and winning National League Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nAdditionally, Gant stole thirty-three bases in , qualifying for the 30–30 club. He duplicated that feat in , joining Willie Mays (–) and Bobby Bonds (–) as the only players in Major League history to that point to have two 30 home run/30 stolen base seasons in a row. Barry Bonds later eclipsed the accomplishment, qualifying for the 30-30 Club in three straight seasons, from –.\n\nAlthough his home run and stolen base totals were extremely similar the following year, most of his other stats were not as good: he hit just .251 with over 100 strike outs and 23 fewer hits in just 14 fewer at bats (AB). His RBI numbers also increased to 105.\n\nThe Braves lost to the Minnesota Twins in the 1991 World Series. Gant batted .267 in the series, with four RBIs, as the Twins won it in a close and exciting seventh game. During Game 2 of the 1991 World Series, Gant had a memorable and controversial confrontation with Twins first baseman Kent Hrbek. As Gant was trying to make it back to first base to avoid Twins pitcher Kevin Tapani's pickoff, he claimed Hrbek pulled his leg off the base during the swipe tag and Gant was called out. Drew Coble, the first base umpire, ruled that Gant's momentum would have carried him off the bag, and refused to change his call. Aiding the controversy the commentators at the time remarked that it appeared that Hrbek had in fact lifted Gant off the bag and that his 235-pound frame helped him lift the lighter Gant who weighs only 172 pounds. Also, \"New York Times\" writer Claire Smith wrote that \"Hrbek seemed to lift Gant's leg right off the bag as the Braves' center fielder fought to keep his balance.\" This play caused the Braves bench to empty during the argument.\n\nAlthough he would never hit .300 again, Gant's batting average continued to climb back up into the .270s and his power numbers stayed great, while he continually drove in over 80 runs a year, peaking at 117 in . In both 1991 and 1993, he was in the top five in the league in runs batted in. His speed and power combination made him bidworthy, and the Reds and Cardinals each paid a lot for him in the mid-90s.\n\nBefore the 1992 season, Gant got into an altercation with future congressman Connie Mack IV. In , Gant made his last World Series appearance, where he got one double in eight at-bats, and the Braves lost again, this time in six games to the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nOn September 15, 1993, during a nationally televised game on ESPN against the Cincinnati Reds, Gant hit a game-winning walk-off home run off Rob Dibble to give the Braves a come from behind victory. The Braves trailed 6–2, going into the bottom of the 9th.\n\nShortly after signing one of the richest contracts in Braves history in , Gant broke his right leg in an ATV accident. The Braves ended up releasing him; he would not play again until 1995, emerging with the Cincinnati Reds before being signed by the St. Lous Cardinals in 1996.\n\nThe next year, Gant would have his last real quality season. With the Phillies in , he batted a solid .260 with 17 home runs and 77 RBIs. He had 13 stolen bases and 107 runs scored, with 27 doubles and two triples, in 134 hits.\n\nHe set the lowest RBI total ever by a player with 25 or more homers (tied in 2015 by Joc Pederson, who also hit 26 home runs with 54 RBIs).\n\nAfter a non-productive 2003 season with the A's, Gant retired at age 38.\n\nIn a 16-season career, Gant batted .256 with 321 home runs and 1008 RBIs. He had 243 stolen bases and 1080 runs scored in 1832 games. Gant had 302 doubles and 50 triples in his career. He ended with 1651 hits in 6449 at-bats.

{"id": "1936485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936485", "title": "Serotype", "text": "Serotype\n\nA serotype or serovar is a distinct variation within a species of bacteria or virus or among immune cells of different individuals. These microorganisms, viruses, or cells are classified together based on their cell surface antigens, allowing the epidemiologic classification of organisms to the subspecies level. A group of serovars with common antigens is called a serogroup or sometimes \"serocomplex\".\n\nSerotyping often plays an essential role in determining species and subspecies. The \"Salmonella\" genus of bacteria, for example, has been determined to have over 2600 serotypes. \"Vibrio cholerae\", the species of bacteria that causes cholera, has over 200 serotypes, based on cell antigens. Only two of them have been observed to produce the potent enterotoxin that results in cholera: O1 and O139.\n\nSerotypes were discovered by the American microbiologist Rebecca Lancefield in 1933.\n\nThe immune system is capable of discerning a cell as being 'self' or 'non-self' according to that cell's serotype. In humans, that serotype is largely determined by human leukocyte antigen (HLA), the human version of the major histocompatibility complex. Cells determined to be non-self are usually recognized by the immune system as foreign, causing an immune response, such as hemagglutination. Serotypes differ widely between individuals; therefore, if cells from one human (or animal) are introduced into another random human, those cells are often determined to be non-self because they do not match the self-serotype. For this reason, transplants between genetically non-identical humans often induce a problematic immune response in the recipient, leading to transplant rejection. In some situations this effect can be reduced by serotyping both recipient and potential donors to determine the closest HLA match.\n\nThe Kauffman–White classification scheme is the basis for naming the manifold serovars of \"Salmonella\". To date, more than 2600 different serotypes have been identified. A \"Salmonella\" serotype is determined by the unique combination of reactions of cell surface antigens. The \"O\" antigen is determined by the outermost portion of the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the \"H\" antigen is based on the flagellar (protein) antigens. \nThere are two species of \"Salmonella\": \"Salmonella bongori\" and \"Salmonella enterica\". \"Salmonella enterica\" can be subdivided into six subspecies.\nThe process to identify the serovar of the bacterium consists of finding the formula of surface antigens which represent the variations of the bacteria. The traditional method for determining the antigen formula is agglutination reactions on slides. The agglutination between the antigen and the antibody is made with a specific antisera, which reacts with the antigen to produce a mass. The antigen O is tested with a bacterial suspension from an agar plate, whereas the antigen H is tested with a bacterial suspension from a broth culture. The scheme classifies the serovar depending on its antigen formula obtained via the agglutination reactions. Additional serotyping methods and alternative subtyping methodologies have been reviewed by Wattiau et al.\n\n\n"}

He was a pioneer in the use of parasites for identification of Pacific Ocean fish stocks. His discoveries became a crucial point in negotiations over pacific salmon fisheries, as it could now be determined where each individual fish spawned, in the rivers of Canada or the United States.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, he received a B.Sc. in 1948, a M.Sc. in 1950, and a Ph.D in 1952 from McGill University. He joined the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, British Columbia, where was a government scientist, advisor, and diplomatic representative. He became Head of the Fish Health and Parasitology Section of the Station in 1967 and was appointed Senior Scientist in 1990. He suffered a heart attack in 1997 while walking home from work and died several days later, at the age of 69, after being airlifted to a Vancouver hospital.\n\nMargolis published a number of papers on fish parasites, but he is famous in the whole community of parasitologists for a paper on \"the use of ecological terms in parasitology\" published in 1982. In 1981, the American Society of Parasitologists appointed an ad hoc committee \"to establish working definitions of a few terms used and misused by parasitological ecologists\", and Margolis was the chairman of this committee. The paper contains the definition of widely used terms such as prevalence and has subsequently been cited thousands of times.\n\n\nA number of taxa have been named in the honour of Leo Margolis.

The screenplay by Ben Hecht became the focus of a contentious history behind the production, and led to the film's eventual suppression by Hope. Hecht had been part of the screenwriting team on a similar themed \"Comrade X\" (1940).\n\nHepburn plays a Soviet military pilot who lands in West Germany and, after sampling life in the West in the company of Hope's Major Chuck Lockwood, is converted to capitalism. Subplots involve Lockwood trying to marry a member of the British upper class and Communist agents trying to get Hepburn's character to return to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe main story borrows heavily from Ernst Lubitsch's \"Ninotchka\" (1939), starring Greta Garbo, and very closely resembles Josef Von Sternberg's \"Jet Pilot\" with Janet Leigh as the Russian pilot and John Wayne as the US Air Force officer, which completed principal photography in 1950, but was not released until 1957, after \"The Iron Petticoat\". \"Jet Pilot\" was also inspired by real-life incidents of Cold War pilot defections.\nCaptain Vinka Kovelenko (Katharine Hepburn) lands a Russian jet in West German territory, to the surprise of US armed forces, who take her prisoner. She is neither on a mission nor defecting, however, just upset about a personal matter back home.\n\nCapt. Chuck Lockwood (Bob Hope) is eager to leave for London and visit his wealthy fiancée Connie (Noelle Middleton). A superior officer named Tarbell (Alan Gifford) cancels his furlough, ordering Chuck to sell the Soviet aviatrix on everything that is good about America and convince her to permanently come over to their side. The colonel even dangles a $100,000 bonus check made out to Vinka, if Lockwood succeeds.\n\nVinka is pursued by her former lover, Ivan (Robert Helpmann), an engineer. She shows no interest in Chuck, and is just as determined to sell him on Russian virtues as he is on influencing her. He describes her as cold and unappealing, but when Connie makes a surprise visit, Vinka strolls into Chuck's room wearing little else but a pajama top and her military medals. Connie becomes increasingly angry, more so when she finds out that Chuck is not as well-off financially as he has pretended to be.\n\nVinka begins to dress more and more in an enticing manner. One night, at a Russian restaurant, comrades come to kidnap her. A sleeping potion meant for Chuck ends up in Tarbell's drink instead. Connie is also mistaken for Vinka in a cloak room, and taken captive.\n\nThe Russians misunderstand Vinka's intentions, and charge her with treason. Chuck leads a daring aerial escape, and they end up falling in love. Money does not matter as much to Vinka as it does to Connie. As she and Lockwood are leaving for America, a Russian agent runs up, offering her the $100,000 check. She declines, but Lockwood grabs it.\n\n\nThe original screenplay \"Not for Money\" was written by Ben Hecht, from a story by producer Harry Saltzman. The two men formed a company to make the film, Benhar. Hecht wrote the film specifically as a vehicle for Katharine Hepburn.\n\nHepburn was pleased by the original script, and personally selected Ralph Thomas as the director, because she liked his movie \"Doctor in the House\" (1954). She contacted Thomas and the latter's producer Betty E. Box while they were making \"Doctor at Sea\" and they agreed to take part. \"I had no idea what dramas were to descend on us as a result of that call\", wrote Box later.\n\n\"We accepted the job because Miss Hepburn agreed to do it, and because we liked the Ben Hecht script\", said Thomas. Box and Thomas were under contract to the Rank film organization, but were allowed to make outside films. \"They [Rank] turned very sour\", wrote Box. \"But we stuck to our guns - we wanted to work with Hepburn, on top of which we were to be paid much larger fees than those guaranteed under our Rank deal.\"\n\nThe film was a US-British co-production, with finance provided by MGM and Romulus Films.\n\nAccording to Box, Hepburn originally envisioned the male lead being played by Cary Grant, William Holden, or James Stewart. However, they struggled to cast it. \"There was difficulty in finding a top star to play opposite Hepburn,\" wrote Box, \"an example of the male chauvinistic attitude which baulks at the leading lady's part being better than the man's.\"\n\nBob Hope got hold of the script, and wanted to play the role. It was unlike anything Hope had done in the past, but he said he wanted to work with Hepburn, and would play the character as written.\n\n\"We all thought the idea quite mad at first,\" said producer Betty E. Box of Hope's casting. \"Then we all had second thoughts and said, 'Why not?' And I must say the first of us to see that it made sense was Katie.\"\n\nAccording to his biographer, Hope also saw the opportunity to get away from the United States at a time when a scandal was tarnishing his reputation as a family man. Hope had been embarrassed by the publication of a \"tell-all\" by former lover Barbara Payton, and advised by close confidantes to leave the United States until the bad press had subsided.\n\nThe film project marked the first time that Hope had worked outside the United States, and in the country of his birth. It had also been more than fifty films since he worked outside Paramount.\n\nAt one stage Kay Kendall was meant to support Hope and Hepburn.\n\nFilming was to begin in November, but Hope was not available. He did not arrive in London until 7 December 1955. He then told Box and Thomas he wanted to pull out of the film, saying he was unhappy with the script. Hepburn and Hecht agreed to make changes to keep Hope on the film. Hope also turned the script over to his own gag writers to tailor it to his style, as was his usual practice. Many of Hepburn's best scenes were cut, and the title was changed from \"Not for Money\". Hope had intended to change his role from a debonair leading man to that of his usual wise-cracking comic. Hepburn considered her pairing with a co-star steeped in comedy routines as a \"challenge\".\n\nHope and Hepburn had a wary relationship during the production as she was aware that the film was being remade into a typical Hope comedy, leaving her aspirations to do a Garbo-like role nearly untenable. Privately, Hepburn characterized Hope as \"the biggest egomaniac with whom I have ever worked in my entire life\". She also considered the film as \"a cheap vaudeville act\", with her appearing as the \"stooge\".\n\n\"It ended up as a Hope comedy\", recalled Thomas. \"He had seven writers, she had none. I can't really say I directed the picture. I refereed it. Each star would come on the set each day with a different piece of script. Each was happy with the scene he had - until they compared notes!\"\n\nDonald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios, had a permanent dressing room in the same block as Hepburn's. He said, \"Katharine Hepburn was delightful and most professional, but what was deemed by some to be 'professional' can also be called 'temperamental' by others. I happened to be on the set of \"The Iron Petticoat\" while Miss Hepburn was blowing off steam about something in a professional/temperamental manner. Bob Hope came to the rescue and with his superb sense of humour said to her, \"If you don't behave yourself. I'll tell everyone that you are Audrey Hepburn's father!\"\n\nA difficult time in the UK was compounded by a worrisome eye infection, but Hepburn, who had made a commitment to the film due to the entreaties by good friend Robert Helpmann, played the \"good trooper\" and completed her obligations, although for years she would not talk about the film. Her later recollections of \"The Iron Petticoat\" were of an unlikely pairing of lead actors, trapped in the wrong roles. She recalled that Hope thought her sense of humour was basically \"zilch\".\n\nProduction took place primarily at the Pinewood Studios, but also utilized unique background locations such as Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circus, as well as air bases in the UK. Although the plot involved a defecting military pilot, only a minimum of aircraft appeared in the production, with the use of a Republic F-84F Thunderstreak as a stand-in for the ubiquitous MiG-15 jet fighter, the staple of 1950s Iron Curtain air forces, including that of the Soviet Union. The spurious \"red star\" markings appear on both the F-84F and C-47 to convert them to their Soviet look-alikes. When Kovelenko's MiG is escorted into West German airspace, two USAF North American F-86D Sabres intercept it. A Douglas C-47 Skytrain (as its counterpart, the Soviet Lisunov Li-2) is used for the return to Russia, while a Boeing Washington B.1 bomber and Avro Anson transport aircraft also appear, albeit mainly as backdrops.\n\n\"The Iron Petticoat\" was released through Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the American market.\n\nHope, whose company controlled US rights as one of the film's producers, cut 12 minutes from the version released in the UK. Hope's cutting prompted Hecht to take a full-page ad in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" which stated:\nMy dear partner Bob Hope: This is to notify you that I have removed my name as author from our mutilated venture, \"The Iron Petticoat\". Unfortunately, your other partner, Katharine Hepburn, can't shy out of the fractured picture with me. Although her magnificent comic performance has been blowtorched out of the film, there is enough left of the Hepburn footage to identify her for her sharpshooters. I am assured by my hopeful predators that \"The Iron Petticoat\" will go over big with people 'who can't get enough of Bob Hope'. Let us hope this swooning contingent is not confined to yourself and your euphoric agent, Louis Shurr.\nAs Hecht told journalist Mike Wallace in a 1958 interview, \"The movie was written for a lady, Miss Katharine Hepburn, and ended up instead as a role for the hero, Mr. Bob Hope. Miss Hepburn was removed from it by fifty percent. I got irritated and took my name off it – it had nothing to do with the movie I wrote.\"\n\nHope replied with an open letter which stated:\nMy dear Ex-Partner Ben: You once wrote \"The Front Page\", and now you've followed it up with the back page … I am most understanding. The way things are going, you simply can’t afford to be associated with a hit. As for Kate Hepburn, I don’t think she was depressed with the preview audience rave about her performance... Bob 'Blowtorch' Hope.\nOn the US release, the film's credits ended up calling it \"Based on an Original Story by Harry Saltzman\". Saltzman often joked that his first motion picture production was the only Bob Hope film that failed at the box office. The latest release by TCM, however, features a large screen credit: \"Screenplay by Ben Hecht\".\n\n\"The Iron Petticoat\" was a critical failure when it was released beginning in December 1956 in the United States. Bosley Crowther of the \"New York Times\", noting Hecht had disavowed his work on the film, summed up many of the critical appraisals: \"'The Iron Petticoat', which encloses Katharine Hepburn and Bob Hope, is about as inflexible and ponderous as the garment its title describes. And everybody connected with it might be forgiven for trying to claim an out.\" He also wrote: \"Miss Hepburn's Russian affectations and accent are simply horrible, and Mr. Hope's wistful efforts with feeble gags to hold his franchise as a funny man are downright sad. The notion of these two characters falling rapturously, romantically in love is virtually revolting. If this was meant to be a travesty, it is.\"\n\nIn an interview in 1972, Italian actress Rossella Falk said that Garbo was \"unhappy with Hepburn because she made a movie called 'The Iron Petticoat'. The film was a parody on 'Ninotchka', and Garbo thought the Hepburn film was the worst film that she had ever seen.\"\n\nAccording to MGM records, the film was a modest box office success, earning $1,260,000 in the US and Canada, and $125,000 elsewhere. Low production costs resulted in a profit of $109,000.\n\nThe film's distribution rights were divided between Hope's company, which controlled the Western Hemisphere, and the UK company Romulus Films, which held the Eastern Hemisphere, including the UK. MGM received a 10-year licence for the Western Hemisphere in 1955.\n\nAfter its initial theatrical release, \"The Iron Petticoat\" had only two public screenings in the US, at the Museum of Modern Art and the American Film Institute, both sanctioned by Hope Enterprises after MGM's rights expired in 1970. Apparently withheld because of Hope's unhappiness over the public controversy with Hecht, it had never been shown on US television, and has never been released on home video there, though it is readily available in the UK, where rights are currently controlled by ITV.\n\nTurner Classic Movies indicated in April 2012 that it has entered into an agreement with Hope Enterprises for a 10-year licence for US and Canadian TV rights and negotiated to release \"The Iron Petticoat\" on Blu-ray and DVD in North America as part of its TCM Vault Collection video line. TCM aired the film on 29 November 2012, almost a decade after the deaths of both leads.\n\nAfter filming ended it was announced Saltzman, Hecht and Thomas would make an adaptation of \"The Imaginary Invalid\" starring Robert Helpmann. However this film was never made.\n\n\n"}

Mini-baccarat is popular in many casinos, especially among Asian gamblers.\n\nMini-baccarat is a comparing card game played between two hands, the \"player\" and the \"banker\". Each baccarat coup has three possible outcomes: \"player\" (player has the higher score), \"banker\" (banker has the high score), and \"tie\".

{"id": "1936518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936518", "title": "List of highways in Puerto Rico", "text": "List of highways in Puerto Rico\n\nThe highway system in Puerto Rico is composed of approximately of roads in Puerto Rico, maintained by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works (Spanish: \"Departmento de Transportación y Obras Públicas\") or DTOP. The highway system in Puerto Rico is divided into four networks: primary, urban primary, secondary or inter-municipal, and tertiary or local (Spanish: \"red primaria\", \"red primaria urbana\", \"red secundaria o intermunicipal\", and \"red terciaria o local\"). Highways may change between networks and retain their same numbers.\n\nPuerto Rico roads are classified according to the network they belong to. There are four types: primary, urban primary, secondary, and tertiary.\n\nIn this regard, a primary road is one which is part of the primary network, an urban primary road is part of the urban primary network, etc. Generally, the same highway may change between networks, but the highway will continue to have the same number. For example, PR-1, connecting Ponce and San Juan, is signed as urban primary inside the Ponce city limits, then it is signed as secondary in Ponce's rural barrio Capitanejo, and then it is again signed as urban primary on its entry into the town of Santa Isabel.\n\nPrimary roads are numbered 1 through 99, secondary roads are numbered 100 to 299, and tertiary roads are numbered 300 to 9999. In 2009, primary routes comprise about 14% of the total Commonwealth system mileage, secondary about 30%, and tertiary (municipal) about 56% of the total mileage.\n\nAt least two other markers can be observed in Puerto Rico roads today (2019). The first is the older style road marker which, above the route number, also had the outline of the main island of Puerto Rico with the words \"Puerto Rico\" on the outline as shown here. Until 1999, all non-tolled numbered highways in Puerto Rico had the same route marker, a square with a white-on-black half-circle with the route number in the bottom two thirds and a map of Puerto Rico with the words \"Puerto Rico\" written inside in the top third. A second road marker, used on the road through El Yunque National Forest, is the brown-colored upside-down trapezoidal marker with the road number on the top two-thirds of the sign and the words \"Bosque Nacional\" (national forest) on the bottom one-third, as shown.\n\nAll Puerto Rico Highway System roads, regardless of the classification used, are maintained by the centralized, Commonwealth-level, Departmento de Transportación y Obras Públicas (DTOP). Municipal governments are not responsible for maintenance of the Puerto Rico Highway System roads within their territory; whether or not the municipal government is an autonomous government, DTOP is the responsible agency. The DTOP maintains a network of regional offices throughout the island which carry out DTOP work within their multi-municipality region. Municipal governments are only responsible for maintenance of city and town streets within their jurisdictions. On occasion, the central government has entered into memoranda of agreement with municipal governments for the collaborative maintenance of some Puerto Rico Highway System roadways within their municipalities.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, the term \"municipal road\" may be encountered occasionally. This is not a “fourth” network of State roads. Roadways that have both their terminus within the same municipality are called tertiary roads and are, by convention, numbered PR-300 through PR-9999. Tertiary roads are also sometimes called \"Carreteras de la red local\" (English: \"Local network roads\"). \n\nHowever, the term \"municipal road\" or \"municipal highway\" (Spanish: \"Carretera municipal\") refers to any public roadway that is not marked with a Puerto Rico road marker. Roadways marked with a Puerto Rico road marker are those public roadways that include \"PR\" followed by a number in its markers. Such roads are considered State roads and part of the Puerto Rico Highway System. Public roadways that do not include such markings are termed \"municipal roadways\". Unlike State roads, which are signed with numbers, municipal roads are signed with names, such as \"Calle Hostos\", \"Calle De Diego\", \"Calle San Jorge\", \"Calle León M. Acuña\".\n\nTertiary roads are not municipal roads even though at times the term \"municipal road\" has been used (as a shortcut to \"intra-municipal road\")—even by the Government of Puerto Rico—to refer to a tertiary State road. The confusion comes from the context in which the phrase \"municipal road\" occurs. When the term \"municipal road\" occurs in the context of roads owned and maintained by the State government, \"municipal roads\" means tertiary State network roads. In this context, a \"municipal road\" and a State tertiary road both refer to the same network of State roads. However, if the term occurs in the context of roadways owned and maintained by a municipal government, it refers to the network of local streets and roadways that make up the urban landscape of a municipality. \n\nAnother context sometimes encountered is the context of how a road is used, that is, the purpose of a road. The purpose of a road is indicative of whether a road is a municipal road or not. In its strictest meaning, the term \"municipal roads\" refers to roads within a municipality's urban center that provide access from one urban neighborhood to another urban neighborhood within the same urban area (city, town, \"poblado\", etc.), while in the larger context of the State highway system, \"municipal roads\" refers to roads that “provide access to the main urban area of a municipality from peripheral communities” (that is, tertiary roads). Municipal roads are maintained by the municipal government where those roads occur, while tertiary roads are maintained by the State government. As stated under the section \"Road maintenance\", at times the State government has entered into Memorandums of Agreement with municipal governments for the upkeep of a State tertiary roadway (note this is a State-owned road that runs entirely within a single municipality), but this does not make it a municipal road—the road continues to maintain its State signage and ownership.\n\nHighways with control access fall into three types: An \"expressway\" is an arterial highway with full or partial control of access. Expressways with full control of access are termed \"freeways\". If the freeway charges a toll for its use, it is called an . Most tollbooths accept the , an electronic toll collection system, to avoid traffic congestion. Toll roads between San Juan and Arecibo, and between San Juan and Ponce were envisioned by J. Raymond Watson, a Puerto Rican engineer, in 1970.\n\nAll Puerto Rico expressways are signed either as primary or as primary urban routes.\n\nBelow is a list of some highways in Puerto Rico along with the municipalities where they begin and end.\n\nPrimary roads are numbered in the 1 to 99 range and are distributed randomly throughout the island.\n\nSecondary roads are numbered in the 100 to 299 range. Unlike primary highways, which are numbered randomly throughout the island, secondary highways generally follow a grid pattern. They begin from the southwest portion of the island with PR-100 and increase in number as you progress in a northeasterly fashion. PR-100 is located in the southwestern town of Cabo Rojo, whilst PR-198 is in Juncos, Las Piedras and Humacao in the eastern part of Puerto Rico. The highest secondary highway number assigned so far (February 2014) is 252 (PR-252), located in the northeastern municipality-island of Culebra. A few roads “violate” this grid order; for example, PR-199 lies in Guaynabo and San Juan.\n\nTertiary highways also follow a general grid. Towns which do not border the Atlantic Ocean or the Caribbean Sea, especially in the mountainous area, may overlap this grid, for example Ciales may have both highways in the 600-699 grid and the 500-599 grid, depending where they begin further north or further south. Generally along the areas where the highways are, the lower the number, the more south it is. Culebra is the only town in Puerto Rico that does not fall in any of the regions, for only PR-250 and PR-251 are the main routes. The entire immediate metropolitan area of San Juan with the exception of Caguas falls in the 800 region, while the entire east coast (north and south) east of San Juan, Caguas and Patillas fall in the 900 region. This is because the eastern portion of Puerto Rico has a southeastern coast which goes to the west from Humacao, which roughly defines where the Vieques Passage and the Caribbean Sea meet along the coast. Yabucoa is in the exact south-southeast area and lies in the 900 region, while Maunabo overlaps the 700's and 900's regions. Vieques, an offshore island-municipality, has some highways in the 900 order.\n\nSome roads are numbered using four digits. For example, PR-5506. These are branches, or spurs, of tertiary roads by the same last three digit number. Thus, PR-5506 is a branch of PR-506. They are often dead end branches, and are common in the mountain regions of the main island. Sometimes they are loops branching off the main road and eventually connecting back to the same main tertiary road. The “fourth” digit is generally a repeat of the first digit of the main tertiary road in question. Thus, a branch of PR-301 would be signed PR-3301, with the added \"3\" prefixing the number of the main tertiary road associated with the spur, 301, because \"3\" is the first digit of the main road. When the road has more than one distinct spur, an additional unrelated digit is used (example, PR-4301).\n\nThere are no Interstate-signed highways in Puerto Rico, but there are roadways that have received up to 90% of their funding from the US Interstate Highway System. Still, at least as of 2007, none of such highways funded by the Interstate Highway program were planned or built to the standards of the Interstate Highway System. As of March 2001, Puerto Rico had of such roadways. As of 2001, there were three highways in Puerto Rico funded under the Interstate Highway Program. For obvious reasons, these routes—as with Interstate Highways in Alaska and Interstate Highways in Hawaii—do not connect to the Interstate Highway System in the contiguous United States.\n\nUnlike Interstate routes in Hawaii, Puerto Rico Interstate routes are unsigned. For administrative and funding purposes, the three routes have been designated as PRI-1, PRI-2 and PRI-3 and run along various combinations of Puerto Rico routes. They do not follow the even-and-odd-number rule used in mainland United States that indicates direction of travel. Per Section 103(c)(1)(B) (ii), Title 23, United States Code (23 U.S.C.) Puerto Rico is exempt from the design standards of Section 109(b).\n\nPuerto Rico's Interstate routes should not to be confused with Puerto Rico Routes PR-1, PR-2, and PR-3, which are other major highways in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1936523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936523", "title": "Sabinov", "text": "Sabinov\n\nSabinov (, , , ) is a small town located in the Prešov Region (north-eastern Slovakia), approximately 20 km from Prešov and 55 km from Košice. The population of Sabinov is 12,700.\n\nThe name apparently comes from some shortened Slavic personal name, e.g. \"Soba\", \"Sobin\", \"Sobina\" (probably a short form of Soběslav). In Poland, there are documented personal names \"Soba\", \"Zoba\", \"Sobien\" (\"Soben\" or \"Sobin\"), \"Sobon\" (\"Soboń\") and medieval village names \"Szebne\", \"Szobniow\". In the Czech Republic, \"Sobyn\", \"Sobień\", \"Soběn\" and medieval village names \"Sobyenow\", \"Sobíňov\", \"Soběnov\". The theory about the origin in a personal name is supported also by the common Slavic possessive suffix \"-ov\" preserved in later documents. The names \"Zob\", \"Zoba\", \"Zobas\" were used also in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 12th-13th century, but they may not be related to Soběslav and could be also of Hungarian origin.\n\nAs legend has it, the name derives from the daughter of the landlord of Tharkveley called \"Szabina\" who would have been the wife of Andrew II of Hungary, and the king built the city in remembrance of her.\n\n1299 \"Scibinio\", 1471 \"Sabinov\", 1518 \"Kiss Zeben\".\n\nThe first written record about Sabinov is from the year 1248 (Sceben). Sabinov was initially a Slovak village until German settlers came in the middle of the 13th century. In 1299 Sabinov received municipal privileges, and in 1405 it was declared a free royal town by king Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor. In the 15th century Sabinov joined the Pentapolitana, an alliance of five towns of northeastern Kingdom of Hungary (Bardejov/Bártfa, Levoča/Lőcse, Košice/Kassa, Prešov/Eperjes and Sabinov/Kisszeben). The 16th and 17th century was the era of Sabinov's development and economic growth followed by the years of recession. In 1740, an important secondary school was established by the Piarists. The history of Sabinov is very similar to the history of other towns in this region.\n\nAccording to the 1880 census, the town had 2,825 inhabitants, 2,088 Slovaks (73.9%), 245 Hungarians (8.7%), 412 Germans (14.6%) and others.\n\nAccording to the 1910 census, the town had 3,288 inhabitants, 1,640 Slovaks (49.9%), 1,168 Hungarians (35.5%), 341 Germans (10.4%), 120 Romanians (3.6%) and others.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, the town had 12,290 inhabitants. 90.62% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 6.40% Roma, 0.48% Czechs and 0.14% Rusyns. Most of the Hungarians were expelled after World War II and their houses confiscated in the \"slovakization\" of Sabinov. The religious makeup was 70.48% Roman Catholics, 10.53% Greek Catholics, 5.14% people with no religious affiliation and 4.16% Lutherans.\n\nThe acclaimed Czechoslovak film, The Shop on Main Street, which was shot in Sabinov during 1964, was awarded the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (of 1965) in Hollywood in 1966. In 1967 the film's lead actress, Ida Kaminska, was nominated for the Best Actress in a Leading Role for her screen work in this motion picture. She and the lead actor, Jozef Kroner, were also honored at the Cannes Film Festival in France for their roles in the film.\n\n\nSabinov is twinned with:\n\n"}
{"id": "1936524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936524", "title": "William Breeze", "text": "William Breeze\n\nWilliam Breeze (born August 12, 1955) is an American author and publisher on magick and philosophy. He is a Patriarch of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, the liturgical arm of Ordo Tempi Orientis, of which he is the current international leader. In this capacity he is a leading editor of the occult works of Aleister Crowley, the founder of the philosophy and religion of Thelema, who is regarded as its prophet. Under the name Hymenaeus Beta he is a successor of Grady McMurtry (Hymenaeus Alpha), who was the first of the caliphs to succeed the Thelemic prophet Aleister Crowley, and served as the Outer Head of Ordo Templi Orientis from 1971 until 1985. Caliph was a designation given to McMurtry by Crowley in relation to the continuing office of Outer Head of the Order (OHO) of OTO of which Crowley was a religious leader. According to Crowley, caliph is the elected spiritual and organizational worldwide leader of OTO and is his successor. A lineage of caliphs carrying religious and organisational significance were designated by Crowley. The caliphs, as successors to Crowley, lead the Order after his death.\n\nBreeze came from a military family. Son of a US Army serviceman, he was born in Paris, France, where his father, Colonel Breeze, was on a tour of duty. Breeze spent his childhood accompanying his father, who had a distinguished military career, on many tours of duty across the United States, staying with him at various US military bases, including Fort Meade where a remote viewing program took place; Nellis Air Force Base, located in close proximity to Groom Dry Lake Air Force Base in Nevada, which is a highly classified remote detachment 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas closely linked to UFO phenomena; Fort Bragg, where \"Project Jedi\" was run by Special Forces; and Montauk Air Force Station, at the eastern tip of Long Island, which was later associated with supposed time travel experiments as part of the Montauk Project. In the 1970s Breeze studied literature at Harvard University.\n\nIn late 1970s, Breeze helped to publish Aleister Crowley's \"Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on The Book of the Law\"; Breeze was co-owner of the publishing company, 93 Publishing.\n\nIn 1979, when Breeze was 24 years old, he met Grady McMurtry. Ten years earlier, McMurtry and his wife, known as Soror Meral, had re-established Ordo Templi Orientis by invoking the emergency orders from Crowley given to McMurtry in the “Caliphate letters”, which gave McMurtry authority (subject to previous OHO's approval) to \"take charge of the whole work of the Order in California to reform the Order\". In 1982 McMurtry granted Breeze a charter to form an Ordo Templi Orientis lodge of which Breeze later became the Master.\n\nMcMurtry served as the head of Ordo Templi Orientis until his death in 1985. In that year, Breeze succeeded McMurtry as Acting Outer Head of OTO, after all active IX-degree members met in order to elect McMurtry's successor. He was nominated by Helen Parsons-Smith, a widow of Wilfred Talbot Smith, who was a founder of Agape Lodge. Upon his election, Breeze assumed the responsibility of raising the O.T.O. to greater heights and of reconstituting the A∴A∴, with a view to re-establish two orders the way Crowley originally envisaged. Over the next decade, Breeze spent his time establishing International Headquarters and chartering new Lodges. By the end of the twentieth century, the organization had grown to several thousand members.\n\nIn 1986 Breeze succeeded McMurtry as the Patriarch of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, the liturgical arm of O.T.O. As a contemporary occult Church, it exists as an integral part of OTO. Breeze was consecrated by E.G.C.'s bishop Jack Hogg as Tau Silenus on August 12, 1974 . Hogg was a bishop of the Gnostic Church of Thelema whose lineage could be traced directly to J. Doinel, one of the founders of the Gnostic tradition, who also consecrated Aleister Crowley. During McMurtry's governance of OTO in the 1970s, the Gnostic Catholic Church and OTO functioned as separate organisations. In 1986, Breeze co-joined the separate Gnostic Catholic Church with OTO. Under his leadership the Church has expanded greatly, growing in several countries.\n\nStarting in 2005, Breeze begun chartering new international Grand Lodges, including those of Australia and United Kingdom, the latter covering England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, plus British Crown Dependencies. Despite the O.T.O. formalising itself with regulations and policies, Breeze allowed the leadership in local areas the freedom to experiment with tactics for growing the organisation.\n\nOn October 10, 2014, Breeze was unanimously re-elected de jure Outer Head of the Order by a council of Grand Masters. On May 16, 2015, his organisation celebrated 30 years of his governing of OTO.\n\nMotta's A∴A∴ movement was first formally announced in the early January 1976, when Motta's edition of the \"Commentaries of AL\" with introduction by James Wasserman went to print. Motta was a disciple of Karl Germer whom he met in 1953 and his A∴A∴ work was also supervised by Germer. Motta, in turn, took on his own students, including James Wasserman and J. Daniel Gunther.\n\nAfter his election as the Outer Head of the O.T.O. in 1985, Breeze sought to rebuild the A∴A∴ so that both orders could again operate in the way Crowley intended. Having spent the years immediately following his election giving most of his attention to the O.T.O activity, in the summer of 1992, together with J. Daniel Gunther who was involved exclusively with the A∴A∴, and other students of Marcelo Motta, Breeze renewed the A∴A∴ activity which at that point was dormant.\n\nThe revived A∴A∴ began to grow. with the subsequent publications of \"The Equinox\" journal, newly typeset in authorised format with exhaustive editorial work by Breeze himself, along with assistance of other O.T.O. and A∴A∴ members, which was issued jointly by the O.T.O. and the A∴A∴, starting with The Equinox Vol IV, No. 1 and 2 published in 1996.\n\nUnder his name as Frater Superior of the O.T.O., \"Hymenaeus Beta\", Breeze is known as the preeminent editor of The Equinox journal, issued jointly by the O.T.O. and the A∴A∴, and the commentaries on the Holy Books of Thelema.\n\nOn April 10, 1982, Breeze and McMurtry began producing a new edition of The Holy Books of Thelema, which was published by Weiser Books in April 1983. Breeze did the design and editorial work, and James Wasserman handled typesetting and the layout, production and proofreading. The Holy Books of Thelema were originally published in 1909 by Crowley under the title \"ΘΕΛΗΜΑ\" in three small books that Crowley had put out privately for the A∴A∴ members. The previous edition by Israel Regardie was published in 1972 with Sangrael Press but was out-of-print.\n\nThe 1996 edition of \"The Law is for All\" (a collection of Crowley's commentary on \"The Book of the Law\") edited by Breeze is based upon the original manuscript of Louis Wilkinson and has an introduction by the material's original editor. It includes annotations, reading lists and indexes not found in the earlier edition.\n\nIn May 2013 Breeze made available his own researches, undertaken for the definitive edition of Liber Legis\n\nDuring the summer of 1982, Equinox Vol. III, No. 10, edited by Breeze, went to press, featuring the core O.T.O. documents. Breeze also added a number of A∴A∴ papers, along with letters from Magick Without Tears, the text of The Book of the Law, and various other writings by Crowley, Wilfred Talbot Smith, and Frater Achad, also featuring James Wasserman's essay on the history of the O.T.O. Breeze wrote an extensive introduction and showcased a group of contemporary Thelemic poets and artists, along with a section on Kenneth Anger's films.\n\nIn 1996 Breeze's edition of The Equinox Vol. IV, No. 1: Commentaries on the Holy Books and Other Papers, went to press. It included number of previously unpublished pieces in the Equinox series, including Liber LXV's commentary, and a colour reproduction of Crowley's illumination of Liber Pyramidos. Its main feature, Liber Cordis Cincte Serpente (Liber LXV) is considered to be one of the Holy Books of Thelema. It includes Crowley's commentary which, unlike in the earlier editions, was positioned opposite and facing the corresponding text of Liber LXV. Breeze's edition also includes other works of Crowley and shorter commentaries which have not been published before, including Charles Stansfeld Jones' commentary on Liber A'ash (written by him as an A∴A∴ assignment, and then annotated by Crowley), and other commentaries Breeze included to aid the aspirants within the system of the magical Order of the A∴A∴ in the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, and the grade of Adeptus Minor. It contains reprinted documents important in defining the A∴A∴ training system, including Crowley's works such as \"One Star in Sight\", \"Liber XIII\", and \"Liber CLXXXV\", to which this book adds An Account of the A∴A∴ introduced by Crowley's essay titled \"Occultism\" published for the first time, including one unpublished version of the A∴A∴ Student Examination. It also contains a large colour plate section including a colour reproduction of Crowley's original illuminated manuscript of Liber Pyramidos and paintings by J. F. C. Fuller dealing with A∴A∴ teachings. These paintings have been used as the covers of the edition.\n\nIn 1998 Breeze's edition of The Equinox Vol. IV, No. 2 went to press. It contains the fourth major edition of Liber 418 (The Vision and the Voice), considered by Crowley to be second in importance behind The Book of the Law which established the religious system of Thelema. Previous major edition of The Vision and the Voice was published by Israel Regardie in 1972 and had been out of print. Breeze's 1998 edition, which includes Crowley's commentary as footnotes, made the material of Liber 418 available to a large audience for the first time.\n\nDevoting much of his time in administering the Order, Breeze also devoted a lot of time to development of the corpus of Thelemic literature and preservation of OTO's archival heritage. Under Breeze, OTO's publishing efforts have undergone a process of standardisation, and many previously unpublished works have been made available through Breeze's meticulous editorial efforts.\n\nIn 1990 Breeze undertook research for the definitive edition of Crowley's Confessions, becoming the biography's co-editor.\n\nIn 1991 Breeze published an edition of Liber Aleph vel CXI: The Book of Wisdom or Folly (93 Publishing, New York), which was a reissue of 1962 edition published by Thelema Publishing Co. Liber Aleph was written in New York City at the end of the First World War and is considered one of the most important commentaries on Crowley's teachings, conceptually written as if to Crowley's magical child, in the style of books fathers used to write for their children, with hereditary spirit of medieval grimoires. The text of Liber Aleph has been described by Crowley as an extended and elaborate commentary on The Book of the Law.\n\nIn 1994 he became the editor of the second edition of Book 4, Liber ABA published by Weiser Books. Through editorial notes, Breeze enabled the reader to trace much of the evolution of Crowley's thoughts through successive revisions of the Magick in Theory and Practice manuscript.\n\nIn his capacity of head of OTO, Breeze helped many investigators such as Lawrence Sutin (author of \"Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley\" published in 2000, ), Richard Kaczynski (author of \"Perdurabo: Life of Aleister Crowley\" published in 2010 by North Atlantic Books, ), Tobias Churton (author of \"Aleister Crowley: The Biography\" published by Watkins Books in 2012, ), and Adam Clayton (author of \"Netherwood: Last Resort of Aleister Crowley\" published by Weiser Antiquarian Books in 2012, ), to study OTO, Thelema, Aleister Crowley and related topics using the materials OTO is the guardian of.\n\nThroughout his career, Breeze helped many women-writers, including Marjorie Cameron and Helen Parsons-Smith, who produced some works on Thelema and Magick as well as published some editions of Crowley's lesser-known works in the early 70's with Breeze's help.\n\nSmith first came in contact with Breeze when he worked with Peter Macfarlane who ran 93 Publishing, a small publishing company in Quebec, Canada. Smith asked for assistance with publishing of some of Crowley's limited edition works. She was later instrumental in Outer Head of The Order elections, nominating Breeze as one of the candidates.\n\nLos Angeles artist and occultist Marjorie Cameron was Breeze's close friend. On February 10, 2015, Breeze chaired a panel discussion dedicated to Cameron and her work, which was held at Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nIn his capacity of Frater Superior of OTO, Breeze advised several American museums and exhibitions on esoteric art. In February 2016, Breeze co-chaired “Occult and Art” panel discussion which took place at 80WSE Gallery in New York with Professor Susan L. Aberth and artist Jesse Bransford co-chairing the panel. The panel discussed various artists and occultists, including Aleister Crowley, whose paintings were exhibited amongst other modern and contemporary artists who have each expressed their own engagement in magical practice.\n\nUnder his name as Frater Superior of the O.T.O., \"Hymenaeus Beta\", Breeze has written extensively on magic and Thelemic initiation in various occult periodicals, including \"The Magical Link\" and texts entitled \"Culture Versus Cult\" contained within \"The Equinox Vol 3 No. 10\", published in 1990. His editorial forewords include \nprolegomenon to \"Liber Aleph Vel CXI: The Book of Wisdom or Folly\", preface to \"Initiation in the Aeon of the Child: The Inward Journey\" written by J. Daniel Gunther (published in 2014, ), as well as editorial introduction to \"Magick: Liber ABA, Book Four\" () and introduction to Aleister Crowley's edition of \"The Goetia\", which explores the relationship between Crowley and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, and the importance of the Lesser Key of Solomon in the grimoire tradition.\n\n\nAs a musician, Breeze came to prominence in the late 1990s when in the early years of his musical career he worked with poet-percussionist and Velvet Underground cofounder Angus MacLise. Breeze played electric viola, mandolin, guitar, bass and electronics. Footage of Breeze performing alongside Maclise was shown at the exhibition \"Dreamweapon: The Art and Life of Angus MacLise (1938–1979)\" from May 10–29, 2011 curated by Johan Kugelberg and Will Swofford Cameron.\n\nBreeze has played with Psychic TV and appears on the recordings \"Thee Fractured Garden\" (1995), \"Cold Blue Torch\" (1995), \"Trip Reset\" (1996) and \"Spatial Memory\" (1996) and is mostly credited as playing viola and viola synthesizer.\n\nBreeze has been a member of Coil as an electric viola player from 1994 through 2004. Coil was a British avant garde music band founded by John Balance and Peter Christopherson whose main studio was based in Bristol. Starting in 1994, Breeze played electric viola on many Coil albums, including Time Machines, released in 1998, and accompanied the band on various live tours, including Barcelona tour in 2000.\n\nAfter Coil's dissolution in 2004, Breeze became a member of Current 93, an experimental music group founded by David Tibet.\n\nBreeze supports numerous non-profit organisations which promote the human rights and religious liberty of religious minorities as well as campaign for religious freedom and freedom of belief. He made a significant contribution to enhancing religious freedom internationally through various means such as creation of public and private spaces for positive inter-faith exchanges.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1936526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936526", "title": "Symphony No. 6 (Bruckner)", "text": "Symphony No. 6 (Bruckner)\n\nSymphony No. 6 in A major (WAB 106) by Austrian composer Anton Bruckner (1824–1896) is a work in four movements composed between September 24, 1879 and September 3, 1881 and dedicated to his landlord, Anton van Ölzelt-Newin. Though it possesses many characteristic features of a Bruckner symphony, it differs the most from the rest of his symphonic repertory. Redlich went so far as to cite the lack of hallmarks of Bruckner's symphonic compositional style in the Sixth Symphony for the somewhat bewildered reaction of supporters and critics alike.\n\nAccording to Robert Simpson, though not commonly performed and often thought of as the ugly duckling of Bruckner's symphonic body of work, the symphony nonetheless makes an immediate impression of rich and individual expressiveness: \"Its themes are exceptionally beautiful, its harmony has moments of both boldness and subtlety, its instrumentation is the most imaginative he had yet achieved, and it possesses a mastery of classical form that might even have impressed Brahms.\"\n\nBy the time Bruckner began composing his Symphony No. 6, only three of his symphonies had been performed. The recent premiere of his Third Symphony had been nothing short of disastrous, receiving an extremely negative, though not surprising review from Eduard Hanslick, given Hanslick's predilection for the works of Brahms.\n\n...his artistic intentions are honest, however oddly he employs them. Instead of a critique, therefore, we would rather simply confess that we have not understood his gigantic symphony. Neither were his poetic intentions clear to us...nor could we grasp the purely musical coherence. The composer...was greeted with cheering and was consoled with lively applause at the close by a fraction of the audience that stayed to the end...the Finale, which exceeded all its predecessors in oddities, was only experienced to the last extreme by a little host of hardy adventurers.\n\nThe composition of his Symphony No. 4 marked the beginning of what some refer to as the \"Major Tetralogy\", Bruckner's four symphonies composed in major keys. In fact, this tetralogy was part of an entire decade in Bruckner's compositional history devoted to large-scale works written in major keys, a fact of note considering that all of his previous symphonies and foremost choral works were composed in minor keys. The composition of his String Quintet and the Sixth Symphony marked the beginning of a new compositional period for Bruckner within the realm of the \"Major Tetralogy\". However, the Sixth Symphony has extensive ties to the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies and is considered to have been composed as a reflective, humanistic response to its two direct symphonic predecessors. It has even been dubbed the \"Philosophical\" symphony by critics for this reason.\n\nBruckner's symphonies encompass many techniques but the one unwavering hallmark of his symphonic compositions is a singular formal pattern that underwent very little variation over the course of his symphonic repertory. In fact, their four extended movements are indebted to the structure and thematic treatment in the late works of Beethoven. The only large-scale diversion from this formal scheme in the Sixth Symphony is Bruckner's use of sonata form in the second movement instead of his usual large-scale ternary form.\n\nThematically speaking, there are two distinct varieties of themes in Bruckner's symphonies. First, there are themes that are clearly defined in shape and then there are the themes that operate more as motives with a shorter length and a more open-ended shape, as is typical of the Sixth Symphony. Another characteristic thematic feature of Bruckner's symphonies is the intimate relationship between the outer two movements, though there is typically more of an emphasis on thematic contrast within the first movement. Specifically, the amplification of the exposition of the first movement consists of two subsidiary themes as well as the primary theme, which are subsequently developed, a technique that is considered uniquely Brucknerian.\n\nOther characteristics that are found in Bruckner's symphonies (especially the Sixth) include the extensive treatment of the dominant seventh chord as a German sixth chord in a new key, usage of cadences as a decisive factor in daring modulations, the treatment of organ points as pivotal to the harmony and structure, chains of harmonic sequences, and, most notably, extensive use of rhythmic motives, especially the characteristic Bruckner rhythm, a rhythm consisting of two fourths and three quarter notes, or vice versa. This rhythm dominated most of the Fourth Symphony and was practically nonexistent in the Fifth Symphony, but becomes nothing short of a driving force in the Sixth Symphony; the metric complexities generated by this unique rhythmic grouping are more pronounced in the first movement of the Sixth Symphony than in any of Bruckner's other compositions.\n\nThe orchestration of the Sixth Symphony complies with Bruckner's customary, albeit peculiar, techniques. Just as in his other symphonic works, there are no marks of extreme virtuosity apparent in the score and the lines are straightforward. The Sixth Symphony is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, bass tuba, timpani, and string section. Bruckner commonly alternates between solo and tutti sections, as well as layering instruments to provide texture and show different subject groups.\n\nThe symphony has four movements:\nBruckner labels this movement \"Majestoso\", not the conventional \"Maestoso\", probably from his Latin (from \"Maiestas\" – sovereign power). The movement, in obvious sonata form, opens with the characteristic 'Bruckner rhythm' played in the violins, though Bruckner is careful to maintain the enigmatic atmosphere by indicating a bowing that keeps the bow on the string and therefore prohibits the rhythmic figure from becoming too lively. One then hears the quietly intense main theme, a paraphrase of the main theme of Bruckner's own Symphony No. 4, stated in the low strings and juxtaposed against the pulsating rhythm in the violins:\n\\new Staff \\relative cis\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Majestoso\" 2 = 54\n\\new Staff \\relative e, { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\major \\clef bass \\time 2/2\nR1 | % 2\n</score>\n\nThe key is A major when the first theme enters; however, the mystery is heightened by notes outside the realm of A major tonality that appear in the melodic line, namely the pitches G, B and F, Neapolitan inflections that will have large-scale tonal effects that come to fruition later in the symphony. The counterstatement of the theme appears (bar 25) in \"fortissimo\", a long-established classical technique that Bruckner had yet to use at the beginning of a symphony.\n\nThe second theme group is more complex than the primary theme. The first theme of this group is a confident melody in the violins in which Bruckner employs mixed rhythms: \n\\new Staff \\relative e { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key e \\minor \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n\\times 2/3 {\n</score>\nThe second theme in this group, an expressive, lyrical motif (bar 69) is first heard in D major, closely followed by a statement in F major and a richly orchestrated statement in E major, the dominant of the movement's original A major. The third theme group, beginning with a militaristic statement of the Bruckner rhythm, now appears, followed by modulations ending in the dominant (E major) and segueing into the development section:\n\\new Staff \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key c \\major \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n</score>\nThe development is shorter and less complex than one usually finds in Bruckner's symphonic first movements; however, it plays a substantial role in the overall harmonic structure of the movement. From the outset (bar 159), the violins play an inversion of the main theme, though the Bruckner rhythm that accompanied it in the exposition is absent. Instead, the development is propelled throughout by the triplet motif that first appeared in the third subject of the exposition. Harmonically, the development encompasses a myriad of modulations, abruptly traversing between E and A major, seemingly signaling the beginning of the recapitulation.\n\nThe beginning of the recapitulation is, in fact, a climax, serving as both the end of the development and the beginning of the recapitulation, marking the first time in symphonic literature that this has occurred. If not for this climactic moment, one could have trouble identifying the exact moment of recapitulation as the return of the tonic and the return of the primary theme do not coincide (in fact, there are 15 bars in between the two events). In true Bruckner form, it encompasses a complete restatement of the theme groups from the exposition and is otherwise uneventful, setting the stage for the coda which Donald Tovey described as one of Bruckner's greatest passages. In the Coda, Bruckner passes through the entire spectrum of tonality, leaving no key unsuggested; however, he establishes no tonal center except for A major. The opening phrase of the first theme appears throughout, joined (bar 345) by the rhythmic motive from the beginning. An exultant final statement of that theme and the completion of a massive plagal cadence signal the end of the first movement.\n\nThe second movement is in obvious sonata form, the only example of a sonata structure \"Adagio\" in Bruckner's symphonies, apart from that of the \"nullified\" Symphony in D minor and the early draft of the Adagio of the First Symphony, dating from 1865. Simpson went so far as to describe the movement as the most perfectly realized slow sonata design since the \"Adagio\" of Beethoven's \"Hammerklavier\" sonata The movement opens with a theme in the strings, a yearning love song that is joined (bar 5) by a mournful lament on the oboe:\n\\new Staff \\relative ges\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key f \\major \\clef treble \\time 4/4 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Sehr feierlich\" 4 = 45\n</score>\nSimpson points out that the frequent Neapolitan inflections of the first movement are expanded here, beginning with the B and F in the primary melodic line that make it natural that the movement should be in F major, though the opening initially ambiguously suggests B minor. After a brief transitional passage, there is a modulation to E major that marks the introduction of the second theme, a soaring, untroubled love song (bar 25):\n</score>\nThe third theme (bar 53) is characteristic of a funeral march, combining C minor and A major and providing a somber contrast to the preceding love song:\n\\new Staff \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"string ensemble 1\" \\key aes \\major \\clef bass \\time 4/4\n</score>\nThe dotted rhythm in its first bar calls to mind the oboe lament from the beginning of the movement. Doernberg described this sad turn to A major as the kind of music Gustav Mahler always wished to achieve, citing Bruckner as anticipatory to Mahler in this respect.\n\nThere is a brief developmental section (bar 69) that includes modulation on the primary theme as well as inversions of the oboe lament. There is a recapitulation of all three themes (bar 93) though the orchestration is different, with the former violin theme (primary theme) now appearing in the horn and subsequently in the woodwinds. The second theme is recapitulated in its entirety in the tonic followed by a very short reappearance of the third theme.\n\nFinally, a transition over a dominant pedal (a Bruckner hallmark) leads to the Coda that Simpson referred to as the fine-drawn consolatory coda that is one of Bruckner's best. At bar 157 one hears the last statement of the primary theme with the movement ending in its tonic, F major, in a state of \"perfect serenity.\"\n\nThe A minor third movement is unlike any other composed by Bruckner; it is slower than usual and the tense character often associated with his Scherzi is often shadowed and muted, although there are movements of brilliance. However, the most prominent feature is the lack of a striking Scherzo theme; instead one finds three contrasting rhythmical motives juxtaposed from the very beginning and united throughout the majority of the movement. Its steady time is pervaded, once again, by triplets throughout, often giving the impression of and creating a broader sense of movement that is extremely deliberate, especially for a scherzo movement:\n\\new Staff \\relative e { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\minor \\clef treble \\time 3/4\n\\new Staff \\relative e, { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\minor \\clef bass \\time 3/4\n</score>\nThere is a certain degree of harmonic ambiguity throughout, but nothing that compares to the opening of the first movement. One of the most fascinating features of the harmonic structure is Bruckner's avoidance of a root position tonic chord for much of the movement. The first twenty bars of the movement once again rest on a dominant pedal and when the bass finally moves to the tonic pitch (A), it is not a root position tonic chord; instead, it acts as the bottom of a first inversion chord of F major (bar 21).\n\nIn the development, one sees the addition of a new motif and harmonically, the section centers around D major, G major, and B minor, all closely related keys but ones that are isolated from the tonic (A minor). The dominant of A minor is reached (bar 75) and here, the recapitulation begins, once again over a dominant pedal. It is important to note that there has still not been a root chord of A minor. This elusive A minor root chord finally appears at the end of the recapitulation leading into the C major Trio section.\n\nThe slow trio is in the style of a Ländler, an Austrian folk dance and, according to Williamson, confirms that in Bruckner's works, it [the trio] is a place for construction in tone color as in the moment when horn and pizzicato strings compete on the same rhythmic figure:\n\\new Staff \\relative as { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"pizzicato strings\" \\key c \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/4 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Langsam\" 4 = 52\n\\new Staff \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"pizzicato strings\" \\key c \\major \\clef bass \\time 2/4\nc8 ^\"pizz.\" -. r8 r4 | % 2\n</score>\nIn fact, this dialogue between pizzicato strings, horn and woodwinds is central to the texture of the whole Trio section. Although the key is C major, there are moments of harmonic ambiguity, as in the preceding movements. At one point (bar 5), the strings point towards D major while the woodwinds attempt to assert A major by quoting the inversion of the main theme of Symphony No. 5 that is in A major. The scherzo returns in its entirety at the end of the trio, adhering to a typical large-scale ternary structure.\n\nWatson characterized the Finale as a steady, organic assertion of A major against its Neapolitan relatives. However, this sonata form movement begins with a theme in Phrygian A minor that once again stresses Neapolitan relationships with the obvious presence of the flat sixth (the pitch being F):\n\\new Staff \\relative f' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"paino\" \\key a \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell\" 4 = 120\n\\new Staff \\relative e { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\minor \\clef alto \\time 2/2\n\\new Staff \\relative d { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\minor \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n</score>\nThe horns and trumpets interrupt with statements in A major (bar 22) but the theme is undeterred; four bars later they once again interrupt the theme and this time succeed in establishing A major (bar 29). A second theme in C major eventually appears:\nc4 r4 a4 r4 | % 2\n</score>\nThis is followed by a third theme (bar 125) that is derived from the oboe lament of the second movement:\n\\new Staff \\relative b' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"paino\" \\key e \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 120\n\\new Staff \\relative b { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key e \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/2\n</score>\nDuring the development section the music continues to modulate through a variety of major keys, including F major, E major and E major until finally returning to the tonic A major (bar 245), regarded as the start of the recapitulation.\n\nThe Coda once again encompasses a broad range of keys and juxtaposes the primary theme with the main theme from the first movement. A final massive statement of A major asserts itself (bar 397) seemingly out of nowhere, embodying Bruckner's amazing ability to establish the tonic without a doubt and without the kind of preparation one would normally expect. This movement does not, nor was it intended to have the vast impact of the Finale of the Fifth Symphony, but it is infinitely more refined than the Finale of his Fourth Symphony. According to Watson, the victorious conclusion of Bruckner's quest for a new and ideal finale form will be celebrated in his Eighth Symphony, but the Sixth Symphony's development is an eminent and profoundly satisfying landmark on that triumphant march.\n\nThis is the only Bruckner symphony exempt from any revisions by the composer. (The Fifth, Sixth and Seventh represent Bruckner's period of confidence as a composer and, along with the unfinished Ninth, are as a group the symphonies he did not extensively revise.) The Sixth was first published in 1899, a task overseen by former Bruckner pupil Cyrill Hynais. This edition did encompass a few minute changes from Bruckner's original, including the repetition of the second half of the Trio in the third movement. The next edition appeared only in 1935, from Robert Haas under \"Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft\" auspices. In 1952 Leopold Nowak, who took over Haas's job, published an edition that was a replicate of Bruckner's 1881 original score. In 1986 the \"IBG\" issued an “audit” of the efforts of Hynais, Haas and Nowak, and in 1997 it republished the Nowak.\n\nThe version of the Sixth performed under the direction of Mahler for the 1899 premiere was never published; Mahler had made substantial changes to the whole score before that performance, of course unsanctioned by the deceased Bruckner. There exists also an inauthentic edition by Schalk.\n\nCriticism of Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 is similar to the critical response that his preceding symphonies had received. Whereas Bruckner considered his Sixth Symphony to be his \"boldest symphony,\" it was not generally held in high regard. In terms of interpretation, the Sixth Symphony has also been the unluckiest, with the vast majority of conductors ignoring Bruckner's specific tempo markings and throwing off the carefully planned balance of the movements. One 2004 reviewer for \"The Musical Times\" referred to the inner movements of this symphony as \"flawed but attractive enough\" and dubbed the outer movements \"burdensome.\"\n\nHanslick, as usual, was without a doubt the harshest critic of them all. He was once quoted as saying, \"whom I wish to destroy shall be destroyed,\" and Bruckner seems to have been a prime target. After hearing the 1883 performance of the middle movements of the Sixth Symphony, Hanslick wrote:\n\nIt has become ever harder for me personally to achieve a proper relationship with these peculiar compositions in which clever, original, and even inspired moments alternate frequently without recognizable connection with barely understandable platitudes, empty and dull patches, stretched out over such unsparing length as to threaten to run players as well as listeners out of breath.\n\nHere, Hanslick touched on the most common complaint about Bruckner's symphonic writing: the seemingly endless journey to a conclusion of musical thought. Dyneley Hussey critiqued the Sixth Symphony in a 1957 review for \"The Musical Times\" and reached the same conclusions half a century later, writing: \nHis most tiresome habit is his way of pulling up dead at frequent intervals, and then starting the argument all over again...One has the impression...that we are traversing a town with innumerable traffic lights, all of which turn red as we approach them.\nHarsh critical reception of the Sixth Symphony, as well as his entire body of work, can also be attributed to critical reception of Bruckner as a person. He was a devout Catholic whose religious fervor often had a negative effect on those he encountered. One of his pupils, Franz Schalk, commented that it was the age of moral and spiritual liberalism...but also in which he [Bruckner] intruded...with his medieval, monasterial concept of humankind and life.\n\nRegardless of the criticisms, both musical and personal, there were some who attempted to find the beauty in Bruckner's Sixth Symphony. Donald Tovey wrote, \"...if one clears their mind, not only of prejudice but of wrong points of view, and treats Bruckner's Sixth Symphony as a kind of music we have never heard before, there is no doubt that its high quality will strike us at every moment\". Still others marvel over the rarity of performances of the Sixth Symphony, citing its bright character and key and its plethora of tender, memorable themes as grounds for more widespread acceptance.\n\nCarl Hruby wrote that Bruckner once said that if he were to speak to Beethoven about bad critiques Beethoven would say, \"My dear Bruckner, don't bother yourself about it. It was no better for me, and the same gentlemen who use me as a stick to beat you with still don't understand my last quartets, however much they may pretend to.\" In saying this, Bruckner both acknowledged his bad critiques and maintained hope that his own compositions might one day garner the same type of positive reaction that Beethoven's music received from his contemporaries.\n\nThe first performance of Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 was by the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Wilhelm Jahn on February 11, 1883, making it the only performance of the piece that Bruckner heard in his lifetime. However, only the two middle movements were performed. The first complete performance of the Sixth Symphony occurred in 1899 conducted by Gustav Mahler who made substantial changes to the score. The first full performance of the original score took place in Stuttgart in 1901, conducted by Karl Pohlig. Since that first full performance, the Sixth Symphony has become part of the symphonic repertory, but is the least performed of Bruckner's symphonies, never overcoming its original status as a symphonic \"stepchild\".\n\nThe oldest surviving recorded performance is of Wilhelm Furtwängler conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 1943; however, the first movement is missing. The oldest surviving \"complete\" recorded performance is of Georg Ludwig Jochum with the Bruckner Orchestra Linz from 1944. The first commercial recording is from 1950 and features Henry Swoboda and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed the Aud, it is the home arena of the Utica Comets, the AHL affiliate of the NHL's Vancouver Canucks, and Utica City FC of the MASL.\n\nThe Utica Memorial Auditorium was conceived by then-Utica mayor John T. McKennan, who believed that the city needed a place for entertainment and sporting events. McKennan and the administration that he hired to plan out the process, led by Frank M. Romano, then hired Gilbert Seltzer, a well-known architect at that time, to draw up plans for the building. A site was found along the old Erie Canal, and groundbreaking took place April 15, 1957. The arena was constructed using the world's first pre-stressed dual cable roof system, designed by Lev Zetlin (who would later partner with architect Philip Johnson to construct both the New York State Pavilion \"Tent of Tomorrow\" seen at the 1964 World's Fair and the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute, also located in Utica, NY) with \"struts\" between the cables. John A. Roebling's Sons Company developed the tensioning method for the project. Zetlin's design became the predecessor to the many modern dome designs seen today, and has since influenced many other tensile structures including Madison Square Garden. Seltzer would take the most pride in constructing \"The Aud\", saying, \"This was the first successful use of cables for a roof structure.\"\n\n\"The Aud\" was also one of the first stadiums to have telescopic seats. Telescopic bleachers (the bleachers pulled out from below higher levels) were common in stadiums, but Zetlin requested more comfortable seating for the arena.\n\nWork continued through 1958 and into 1959. When the Auditorium was finally completed, it became one of just three arenas built without obstructed views. The arena opened on March 13, 1960, with the Greater Utica Industrial Exposition its first event, running three evenings from March 16–19. 96 exhibitors took part in the presentation which drew an attendance of some 45,000. In 1962, it hosted the NCAA Division I Men's Hockey Championship (AKA the \"Frozen Four\"). In 2017, the arena hosted the Division III \"Frozen Four\".\n\nScenes from the 1977 film \"Slap Shot\" starring Paul Newman were shot at the Auditorium. The original center-hung scoreboard, as seen in the movie, was unusual in that the game time was kept by a digital clock, while the penalty time was kept by analog clocks. This was eventually replaced by a center-hung scoreboard designed by Eversan, which includes a one-line messageboard. \"The Aud\" also held a Santana concert on February 22, 1973 during their Caravanserai Tour, their only concert in Utica, and the arena has the distinction of being the location of one of the last scheduled Elvis Presley concerts. The concert was scheduled to be on Friday, August 19, 1977, three days after Presley's death on August 16.\n\nIn 2011, the Utica Memorial Auditorium was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in recognition of its innovative cable suspended roof.\n\nOn June 14, 2013, it was announced that the Peoria Rivermen, the AHL farm team of the National Hockey League's Vancouver Canucks would be relocating to the Utica Memorial Auditorium for the 2013-2014 season as the Utica Comets. As the AHL has a strong presence in Western and Central New York State, the league agreed to the move, citing the move would further boost the league's strength in the Northeast while further cutting down on travel expenses. Travis Green was named as the first head coach in team history on July 23, 2013, joining the Comets from the Portland Winterhawks of the WHL. The Comets played their first game in franchise history on October 11, 2013 at Blue Cross Arena in Rochester, losing 4-1 to the Rochester Americans. The first Comet goal ever (and the game's lone Comet goal) was scored by Pascal Pelletier at 13:28 of the third period. On October 23, 2013, the Comets played at \"The Aud\" for the first time, losing 4-1 to the Albany Devils in front of a sold-out crowd. Frank Corrado scored the first Comet goal on home ice (and the Comets' only goal of the game) with 6:48 remaining. Green named Colin Stuart the first captain in team history on October 30, 2013.\n\nToday, in addition to the Comets, the Auditorium plays host to the Utica College Pioneers men's and women's ice hockey teams which play in the United Collegiate Hockey Conference of the NCAA Division III, The Skating Club of Utica, The Jr. Comets Youth Hockey Program and several high school varsity ice hockey teams. It has been the former home for the Mohawk Valley Comets of the North American Hockey League, the Mohawk Valley Stars/Comets of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League, the Utica Devils of the American Hockey League, the Utica Bulldogs/Blizzard and Mohawk Valley Prowlers of the United Hockey League, and the Mohawk Valley IceCats of the North Eastern Hockey League. Both Pioneer hockey teams boast the highest average attendance for a Division III hockey team in the United States, with regular season games frequently selling out.\n\nIn recent years, \"The Aud\" has earned high rankings from various hockey circles, earning the #8 spot in \"The 10 Coolest Hockey Rinks in the World\" list by Complex Magazine, the #8 rank for best AHL arena by Stadium Journey, and #4 in the Pure Hockey Blog's list of the top 6 places to skate for hockey.\n\nPhotos and renderings of the Utica Memorial Auditorium are on permanent display at New York's Museum of Modern Art. The museum's collection honors the auditorium as an architectural landmark.\n\nOn September 27, 2017, the Upper Mohawk Valley Memorial Auditorium Authority announced a 10-year naming rights deal with locally based Adirondack Bank, amending the official name of \"The Aud\" to Adirondack Bank Center at the Utica Memorial Auditorium.\n\nIn November 2017, work was completed on the 26,000-square-foot expansion that added a new entrance, a half-dozen executive suites, a new women's bathroom, a building-wide sprinkler system and other amenities to the facility. The $10.55 million project was fully funded by the state. A restaurant named \"72 Tavern & Grill\" was constructed on existing foundation on the West side of the facility that supported underground areas of the Aud. The \"72\" is in honor of the 72 cables that have held up the roof of the Adirondack Bank Center for more than 50 years. \n\nOn June 1, 2018, the Adirondack Bank Center hosted .\n\nOn June 13, 2018, Mohawk Valley Garden CEO Rob Esche and Major Arena Soccer League (MASL) commissioner Joshua Schaub, along with other officials, announced that Utica will field a professional indoor soccer team — called Utica City Football Club, or UCFC for short — that will play home games at the Adirondack Bank Center at the Utica Memorial Auditorium beginning with the 2018-19 season. The team had previously been known as the Syracuse Silver Knights.\n\nIn addition to its regular season high school hockey games, the Utica Memorial Auditorium hosted the New York State Ice Hockey semi-finals and finals every year from its inception to the 2015 Championships. In August 2015, NYSPHSAA announced it would be moving the state tournament to Buffalo's HarborCenter. On March 9–10, 1973, Utica Memorial Auditorium hosted the 11th NYSPHSAA state wrestling tournament. The annual tournament has not returned to Utica since.\n\n"}

He did his apprenticeship with the \"Isle of Ely and Wisbech Advertiser\". He was employed at the \"Sussex Advertiser\" from 1864 to 1871. He was married twice – first to Ellen Amelia Little in 1874 (who died in 1878) and then to Sara Maria Hutchinson in 1879. William Digby moved to the Indian subcontinent in 1871 and worked as a sub-editor in \"The Ceylon Observer\"., and as the editor of \"The Madras Times\" in 1877. He also worked as the editor of the \"Liverpool and Southport Daily News\" in 1880 and that of the \"Plymouth Daily Western Mercury\" in 1879. He served as senior partner of William Hutchinson and Company in 1887.\n\nWhile working in Sri Lanka, Digby was involved in a temperance campaign and another one for abolishing food taxes.\n\nWhile working in India, he witnessed the Great Famine of 1876–78 and involved himself in relief works. He served as the Honorary Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Famine Relief Fund. He opposed the laissez faire famine relief policies of the Famine Commissioner, Sir Richard Temple and argued for more Government aid in mitigating the effects of famine. In 1878 he wrote an extensive book about the famine titled \"The Famine Campaign in Southern India.Vol I and Vol II\". For his contribution to the famine relief works, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (C.I.E) in 1878. The failure of the Government of India to provide effective famine relief made William Digby an outspoken critic of the British Government's India policy.\n\nDigby returned to England in 1879 after his first wife's death. In November 1882 he became the first secretary of the National Liberal Club, a post he held till 1887. He advocated full economic and racial equality, then representative Government and eventually Self-Government for the Indians. He published \"Indian Problems for English Consideration\" in 1881. In it, Digby argued that Indian reform was 'a Liberal duty', and defined India as 'a larger Ireland'. Digby was an admirer of Lord Ripon and published a pamphlet in February 1885 titled \"India for the Indians -and for England\" in defence of Ripon. He contested the 1885 General Election as a Liberal Party candidate from the Paddington North constituency on a platform of legislative reform in India. He lost to Conservative Party candidate Lionel Louis Cohen by a margin of 685 votes (out of a total 5345 polled).\n\nIn May 1888 he set up the Indian Political and General Agency in London for the purpose of raising awareness about Indian grievances in the British Parliament and Press. He served as its secretary during 1887–1892. He became a strong advocate of constitutional reform and acted as an unofficial guide to Indian National Congress leaders visiting London. He used his political contacts (obtained through his position as the secretary of the National Liberal Club) to raise India's grievances in the British Public sphere. Through his lobbying he was able to get Charles Bradlaugh to attend the Fifth INC Conference held at Bombay in 1889. Bradlaugh also agreed to introduce a bill in British Parliament for establishing legislative councils in India. During this time Digby also worked as the editor of the Congress journal \"India\". Though he was well paid for his efforts, the Congress office bearers in India delayed paying the expenditure for his lobbying efforts. Digby met those expenditures by doing private lobbying for the Maharaja of Kashmir. As part of his lobbying, he wrote a book titled \"\"Condemned Unheard\"\" advocating the Kashmiri king's position. This private lobbying and incidents of Digby and Bradlaugh receiving money from the Kashmiri king for presenting petitions to and raising questions in parliament alarmed Allan Octavian Hume. Hume set up the \"British Committee of the Indian National Congress\" to oversee the Indian Agency's work. The Committee did not want payments to be made to Bradlaugh through its books and completely ended its association with the Indian Agency in 1890. Digby served as the secretary to the British Committee from 1889 to 1892. Digby's continuing private lobbying efforts were a major embarrassment to the Congress and it cut its connections to Digby in September 1892. This ended Digby's association with the Indian National Congress.\n\nDigby contested the 1892 General Election as the Liberal candidate from the South Islington parliamentary constituency. He lost to the Conservative candidate Albert Rollit by 321 votes.\n\nDigby died on 29 September 1904. Condoling his death, The \"Hindu Organ\" wrote that \"\"..his death is a great loss to all eastern subjects of His Majesty\"\". Gandhi wrote an obituary in the Indian Opinion on 29 October 1904 which praised him as follows :\nBy the death of William Digby CIE, India has lost a champion, whom it will be difficult to replace. His advocacy of the Indian cause was strenuous and well-informed... By his voluminous writings,the late Mr. Digby ever kept the different Indian questions before the public.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1936551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936551", "title": "Postmodern feminism", "text": "Postmodern feminism\n\nPostmodern feminism is a mix of post structuralism, postmodernism, and French feminism. The goal of postmodern feminism is to destabilize the patriarchal norms entrenched in society that have led to gender inequality. Postmodern feminists seek to accomplish this goal through rejecting essentialism, philosophy, and universal truths in favor of embracing the differences that exist amongst women to demonstrate that not all women are the same. These ideologies are rejected by postmodern feminists because they believe if a universal truth is applied to all woman of society, it minimizes individual experience, hence they warn women to be aware of ideas displayed as the norm in society since it may stem from masculine notions of how women should be portrayed.\n\nPostmodern feminists seek to analyze any notions that have led to gender inequality in society. Postmodern feminists analyze these notions and attempt to promote equality of gender through critiquing logocentrism, supporting multiple discourses, deconstructing texts, and seeking to promote subjectivity. Postmodern feminists are accredited with drawing attention to dichotomies in society and demonstrating how language influences the difference in treatment of genders.\n\nThe inclusion of postmodern theory into feminist theory is not readily accepted by all feminists, some believe postmodern thought undermines the attacks that feminist theory attempts to create, while other feminists are in favor of the union. For this reason, postmodernism and feminism have always had an uneasy relationship.\n\nPostmodern feminism's major departure from other branches of feminism is perhaps the argument that sex, or at least gender, is itself constructed through language, a view notably propounded in Judith Butler's 1990 book, \"Gender Trouble\". She draws on and critiques the work of Simone de Beauvoir, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan, as well as on Luce Irigaray's argument that what we conventionally regard as 'feminine' is only a reflection of what is constructed as masculine.\n\nButler criticises the distinction drawn by previous feminisms between (biological) sex and (socially constructed) gender. She asks why we assume that material things (such as the body) are not subject to processes of social construction themselves. Butler argues that this does not allow for a sufficient criticism of essentialism: though recognizing that gender is a social construct, feminists assume it is always constructed in the same way. Her argument implies that women's subordination has no single cause or single solution; postmodern feminism is thus criticized for offering no clear path to action. Butler herself rejects the term \"postmodernism\" as too vague to be meaningful.\n\nPaula Moya argues that Butler derives this rejection to postmodernism from misreadings of Cherríe Moraga's work. \"She reads Moraga's statement that 'the danger lies in ranking the oppressions' to mean that we have no way of adjudicating among different kinds of oppressions—that any attempt to casually relate or hierarchize the varieties of oppressions people suffer constitutes an imperializing, colonizing, or totalizing gesture that renders the effort invalid…thus, although Butler at first appears to have understood the critiques of women who have been historically precluded from occupying the position of the 'subject' of feminism, it becomes clear that their voices have been merely instrumental to her\" (Moya, 790) Moya contends that because Butler feels that the varieties of oppressions cannot be summarily ranked, that they cannot be ranked at all; and takes a short-cut by throwing out the idea of not only postmodernism, but women in general.\n\nMary Joe Frug suggested that one \"principle\" of postmodernism is that human experience is located \"inescapably within language\". Power is exercised not only through direct coercion, but also through the way in which language shapes and restricts our reality. She also stated that because language is always open to re-interpretation, it can also be used to resist this shaping and restriction, and so is a potentially fruitful site of political struggle.\n\nFrug's second postmodern principle is that sex is not something natural, nor is it something completely determinate and definable. Rather, sex is part of a system of meaning, produced by language. Frug argues that \"cultural mechanisms ... encode the female body with meanings\", and that these cultural mechanisms then go on explain these meanings \"by an appeal to the 'natural' differences between the sexes, differences that the rules themselves help to produce\".\n\nFrench feminism as it is known today, is an Anglo-American invention coined by Alice Jardine to be a section in a larger movement of postmodernism in France during the 1980s. This included the theorizing of the failure of the modernist project, along with its departure. More specifically for feminism, it meant returning to the debate of sameness and difference. The term was further defined by Toril Moi, an academic with a focus on feminist theory, in her book \"Sexual/Textual Politics.\"In this book she further defined French feminism to only include a few authors such as Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray, and Julia Kristeva, while also creating a distinction between French feminism and Anglo-American Feminism. She states that the difference between the two is that Anglo-American feminists want to find a \"woman-centered perspective\" and a woman identity since they were not given the chance to have one in the past. French Feminists believe there is no identity for a woman but that \"the feminine can be identified where difference and otherness are found.\" Elaine Marks, an academic in the field of Women's Studies, noted another difference between French and American feminists. French feminists, specifically radical feminists, criticized and attacked the systems that benefit men, along with widespread misogyny as a whole, more intensely than their American counterparts. Through American academics contriving their own concept of French feminism, it separated and ignored the already marginalized self-identifying feminists, while focusing on the women theorists associated with Psych et po (Psychanalyse et politique) and other academics who did not always identify as feminists themselves. This division ultimately ended up placing more importance on the theories of the French feminists than the political agenda and goals that groups such as radical feminists and the Mouvement de liberation des femmes(women's liberation movement) had at the time.\n\nThere have been many critiques of postmodern feminism since it originated in the 1990s. Most of the criticism has been from modernists and feminists supporting modernist thought. They have put a focus on the themes of relativism and nihilism as defined by postmodernism. Though modernist critics believe more importantly, that through abandoning the values of Enlightenment thought, postmodern feminism \"precludes the possibility of liberating political action.\" This concern can be seen in critics like Meaghan Morris, who have argued that postmodern feminism runs the risk of undercutting the basis of a politics of action based upon gender difference, through its very anti-essentialism. Alison Assiter published the book \"Enlightened Women\" to critique postmodernists and postmodern feminists alike, saying that there should be a return to Enlightenment values and modernist feminism. Gloria Steinem has also criticized feminist theory, and especially postmodernist feminist theory, as being overly academic, where discourse that is full of jargon and inaccessible is helpful to no one.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1936580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936580", "title": "Yaaku people", "text": "Yaaku people\n\nThe Yaaku, are a people who are said to have lived in regions of southern Ethiopia and central Kenya, possibly through to the 18th century. The language they spoke is today called Yaakunte. The Yaaku assimilated a hunter-gathering population, whom they called Mukogodo, when they first settled in their place of origin and the Mukogodo adopted the Yaakunte language. However, the Yaaku were later assimilated by a food producing population and they lost their way of life. The Yaakunte language was kept alive for sometime by the Mukogodo who maintained their own hunter-gathering way of life, but they were later immersed in Maasai culture and adopted the Maa language and way of life. The Yaakunte language is today facing extinction but is undergoing a revival movement. In the present time, the terms Yaaku and Mukogodo (sometimes Mukogodo Maasai), are used to refer to a population living in Mukogodo forest west of Mount Kenya. \n\nThe name Yaaku is said to be a Southern Nilotic term for hunting people while Mukogodo is a Yaakunte word meaning people who live in rocks.\n\nAccording to Mukogodo traditions recorded by Mhando (2008), the Yaaku speakers moved into Kenya from southern Ethiopia. At this time they were herders and cultivators In this regard, the narratives are congruent with linguistic reconstruction of the history of the Yaakunte speakers. According to linguist Christopher Ehret (1982), the presumed movements of the Eastern Cushities begin with an entry into East Africa at a point in northeast Uganda. From here they moved \"into northern and eastern Kenya as far south as Mt. Kenya. Their modern representatives are the Yaaku hunters who live on the northern slopes of Mt. Kenya\". Other present day representatives of the Eastern Cushities that Ehret notes include, \"the Arbore and Dasanech herders and cultivators in the Lake Turkana/Chew Bahir (Lake Stephanie) region; and the Elmolo fishermen of east Turkana\".\n\nWhen the Yaaku community first entered the territory they would occupy, they met a people who mostly lived by hunting and gathering. However they distinguished themselves from this population by means of residence. This community lived in caves and the Yaaku came to call them Mukogodo, a name which means people who live in rocks in Yaakunte.\n\nTraditions recorded by Mhando portray the Yaaku as having been herders and cultivators when they first settled.\n\nThe Mukogodo in whose localities the Yaaku settled, adopted the language of the Yaaku, referred to as Yaakunte.\n\nThe broad Mukogodo understanding of the decline of Yaaku identity is that the speakers were assimilated by another food producing people, a process that happened over a long period of time. During this period, the Yaaku speaking Mukogodo maintained their way of life and the Yaakunte language.\n\nCertain traditions however, relate the decline of Yaaku identity to a specific period which included conflict;\n\nFadiman (1997) recorded Meru traditions that also give an account of this conflict, which they relate occurred with a community recalled as Muoko. According to the traditions, conflict with the Muoko community had been ongoing for \"decades\". However, a notable period of intense Tigania pressure brought the Muoko within raiding range of the Il Tikirri (recalled in Tigania as Ngiithi) and Mumunyot (recalled as Rimunyo) communities.\n\nFadiman postulates that the absorption of former foes may have therefore significantly modified Tigania institutions and, indirectly, those of adjacent Meru regions as well.\n\nThe Mukogodo assimilated to the pastoralist culture of the Maasai in the first half of the twentieth century (1920s and 1930s), although some still keep bees. The reason for this transition is mostly one of social prestige. The Maasai look down upon hunter-gatherer peoples, calling them Dorobo ('the ones without cattle'), and many Mukogodo consider the Maasai culture superior to their own.\n\nAs a result of the decision to transition to pastoralism, the Mukogodo largely gave up their Cushitic language Yaaku for the Eastern Nilotic Maasai language between 1925 and 1936.\n\n\nIn the present time, both the terms Yaaku and Mukogodo, sometimes Mukogodo Maasai are used to refer to a population living in Mukogodo forest west of Mount Kenya.\n\n\n\n"}

They adopted the pastoralist culture of the Maasai in the first half of the twentieth century, although some still keep bees.

In early 2005, Maarten Mous, Hans Stoks and Matthijs Blonk visited Doldol on the invitation of a special Yaaku committee, to determine whether there is enough knowledge of Yaaku left among the people to revive the language.

The latter two are both of the \"Terito\" age set, which means that they must be around a hundred years old. Knowledge of vocabulary is much wider spread in the community. Full language revival is improbable because of the scarcity of fluent speakers, but one of the possibilities for a partial revival is to use Yaaku vocabulary in the framework of Maa grammar, a strategy that is analogous to the making of Mbugu, a mixed language of the Usambara mountains in Tanzania.\n\n\n"}

It first appeared in the season 4 finale, \"Hope and Fear\". Similar to the Borg transwarp conduits, the slipstream is a narrowly focused, directed field that is initiated by manipulating the fabric of the space-time continuum at the quantum level using the starship's navigational deflector array. This creates a subspace tunnel, which is projected ahead of the vessel. Once a ship has entered this tunnel, the forces inside propel it at incredible speed. To maintain the slipstream, a ship has to constantly modify the quantum field with its deflector dish; however, the calculations involved are too complicated, and the time available too short for 24th-century Starfleet computer technology. When this technology was discovered by the crew of the lost and stranded USS \"Voyager\", it was hoped this could be used to allow the starship to travel at even greater speeds.\n\nHowever, in the episode \"Timeless\", the technology proved to be dangerously unstable, resulting in the loss of all hands of the \"Voyager\" in an alternate timeline. Due to a phase variance, the slipstream tunnel, produced by a replica slipstream drive of the \"Voyager\", collapsed during the flight and the ship crashed on a planet near the border on the edge of the Delta Quadrant. Harry Kim and Chakotay survived, because they used the \"Delta Flyer\", which flew ahead of the \"Voyager\", and reached the Earth safely. Some years after this event, they used a temporal communication device to change the timeline and rescue the ship and crew.\n\nQuantum slipstream technology was one of the items requested in the \"Think Tank\" episode, despite Captain Janeway's admission that they never got it to work properly.\n\nSlipstream travel is also used in the science fiction television series \"Andromeda\".\n\nSlipstream is a series of \"strings\" connected between planetary systems by gravity. A gravity field generator drastically reduces the mass of the ship and then a slipstream drive opens a slippoint which the ship enters. The pilot then navigates the series of slipstream \"tunnels\" until they exit via the desired slip point. Usually one has to enter and exit slipstream several times before reaching their final destination. An A.I. attempting slipstream travel has a 50% chance of selecting the correct route at each intersection encountered. Owing to organic \"intuition\", a living pilot has a 99.97% chance of guessing the correct route to take.\n\nWhile travellers approaching light speed will encounter time dilation, slipstream travel does not.\n\nDue to the complex nature of slipstream probability and difficulty in mapping slipstream, only biological entities are capable of successfully navigating it. Exiting slipstream near the edge of a galaxy or in certain regions of space could be dangerous because it is difficult to find a slippoint in these areas. If a slippoint cannot be found, or a slipstream drive is damaged, the ship is stranded and limited to slower than light speed.\n\nIn the episode \"World War Three\" the Slitheen family from Raxacoricofallapatorius uses a slipstream drive as a form of travel.\n\nIn the Microsoft video game series \"Halo\", based in the 26th century, slipspace (also known as slipstream space) is the general method of faster-than-light travel. Both the alliance of alien races known as the Covenant, and their human opponents, the United Nations Space Command forces, use slipspace to travel between systems. The mechanics are described in more detail in the novel \"\", on page 53.\n\"Shaw-Fujikawa engines allowed UNSC ships to leave normal space and plow through a dimensional subdomain colloquially known as \"Slipstream space.\" ... The drive used particle accelerators to rip apart normal space-time by generating micro black holes. Those holes evaporated via Hawking radiation in a nanosecond. The real quantum mechanical \"magic\" of the drive was how it manipulated those holes in space-time, squeezing a hundred-thousand-ton cruiser into Slipspace.\"\n"}

He was a University Professor Emeritus and a provost at New York's Columbia University. His work focused on the complex relationships between Germans and Jews in the 19th and 20th centuries and on the rise of National Socialism in Germany during the first half of the 20th century.\n\nFritz Richard Stern was born on February 2, 1926, in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), to a locally prominent medical family of Jewish heritage. His father, Rudolf Stern, was a physician, medical researcher and a veteran of the First World War. His mother, , was a noted theorist, practitioner and reformer in the field of education for young children. Through family, friends, and colleagues, they were connected with a number of leading scientific and cultural figures in Europe and later in the U.S. For example, when trying to decide on his career objective while in college, Stern discussed choosing between history and medicine with Albert Einstein.\n\nThe family had converted from Judaism to Lutheran Protestant Christianity at the end of the 19th century, while sharing the increasingly secular worldview frequently found among Germany's educated classes. Stern was baptized shortly after his birth and named after his godfather, another member of the city's intellectual élite, the Nobel Prize winner Fritz Haber (also a Christian convert from Judaism). The Sterns emigrated to the United States in 1938 to escape the virulently anti-Jewish policies of Adolf Hitler's National Socialist government and the increasing violence against all Germans of Jewish ancestry.\n\nThe family settled in Jackson Heights, Queens. There, Stern spent the remainder of his childhood, attended public school and quickly learned English while his parents reestablished their respective careers. He then attended Columbia University, where he received his bachelor's, master's and PhD. His professors included Lionel Trilling.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1997, he served as a professor at Columbia, obtaining the eminent Seth Low chair before attaining the rank of University Professor. Stern also briefly served as provost of the university.\n\nBeginning in 1954, Stern taught frequently as a guest lecturer at the Free University in West Berlin.\n\nIn 1990, he helped persuade British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that a reunited Germany, firmly anchored in the West, would pose no threat to Europe. Thereafter, in 1993–94, Stern served as an adviser to the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Holbrooke. In 2010, Stern spoke at the former German military headquarters building, the Bendlerblock, on the 66th anniversary of the attempted assassination of Hitler. Looking back in January 2016, he told an interviewer, \"Sometimes I bemoaned the fact that I had to grow up amid the disintegration of a democracy; now, at the end of life, I am having to experience again the struggles of democracy.\"\n\nFritz Stern died on May 18, 2016, in New York, aged 90.\n\nThe focus of much of Stern's work an attempt to track the development of the rise of National Socialism in Germany and its characteristics. Stern traced the origins of Nazism back to the 19th-century \"völkische\" movement. In Stern's opinion, the virulently anti-Semitic \"völkische\" movement was the result of the \"politics of cultural despair\" experienced by German intellectuals who were unable to come to grips with modernity. However, Stern rejected the \"Sonderweg\" interpretation of German history. In his view, the ideas of the \"völkische\" movement were merely a \"dark undercurrent\" in 19th-century German society. In the 1990s, Stern was a leading critic of the controversial American author Daniel Goldhagen, whose book \"Hitler's Willing Executioners\" Stern denounced as unscholarly and full of Germanophobia.\n\nAnother major area of research for Stern was the history of the Jewish community in Germany and how the Jewish culture influenced German culture and vice versa. In Stern's view, this interaction produced what Stern often called the \"Jewish-German symbiosis\". In Stern's view, the best example of the \"Jewish-German symbiosis\" was Albert Einstein.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fritz Stern Professorship at the University of Wrocław was established in his honor in 2009. The first person appointed to hold that chair was former German President Richard von Weizsäcker.\n\n"}

Munn Ice Arena is a 6,114-seat hockey-only arena in East Lansing, Michigan on the campus of Michigan State University, situated across Chestnut Road from the Intramural Recreative Sports Center West and Spartan Stadium. It is home to the MSU's ice hockey team. Completed in 1974, the arena is named in honor of former MSU football coach and athletic director Clarence \"Biggie\" Munn.\n\nMunn Arena came to be after debate over building a new basketball or hockey arena in the early 1970s. Plans were to build a new basketball arena and move the ice hockey team to Jenison Fieldhouse. In the end, Michigan State athletic director Burt Smith chose to build a new ice hockey facility to replace Demonstration Hall. Munn Ice Arena was designed by Daverman Associates of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The original design called for 10,000 seats, but MSU was skeptical they could sell that many tickets. Thus instead, they built a 6,250-seat arena.\n\nThe MSU ice hockey team moved out of Dem Hall following the 1973–74 season and into Munn Ice Arena on Nov. 1, 1974. Michigan State lost its first regular season game at Munn 4-3 in overtime to defending national champion Minnesota Golden Gophers.\n\nAs Michigan State grew into a hockey powerhouse in the 1980s, Munn became home to one of the hottest tickets in the state. Improvements were made to accommodate the program's increasing popularity. In 1985, the heat-exchanger pipes for creating ice were replaced by a direct refrigeration system allowing year-round ice. With increasing coverage, the press box was expanded from one row to two rows accommodating 50 people. A new four-sided scoreboard was added at center ice in 1991. To make handicap-accessible seats, the rink's capacity was reduced to 6,170 in the early 1990s. In 1999–2000, the press box was relocated from center ice to the rink end to make room for 300 club seats on the south end. Luxury boxes were added a year later on the north end of the rink. The additions boosted capacity to 6,470. During the same time the four-sided scoreboard was replaced with two boards at the east and west ends of the rink along with two video replay boards. Recent renovations, which included the installation of additional handicap-accessible platforms, brought capacity to its current 6,114.\n\nFor its first 20 years Munn Ice Arena was the premier on-campus collegiate hockey facility in the country. It is still recognized as one of the top campus hockey rinks in the NCAA. It is also used for high school and amateur hockey and ice skating.\n\nA job at Munn is one of the most highly sought after student jobs on Michigan State's campus. The employees have referred to themselves as \"Munnsters\" (a reference to the 1960s TV show with an intentional misspelling), a title which has recently replaced the word \"staff\" on employee uniforms.\n\nMunn Ice Arena was home to the NCAA's longest consecutive regular-season sell-out streak. On Dec. 19, 1985, Michigan State produced a sell-out crowd versus Northern Michigan University. Michigan State went on to sell-out 323 consecutive regular season home games. The streak ended on Oct. 15, 2004 when Munn failed to fill to capacity for a game against St. Lawrence University.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ian was proprietor of a military books store and Roger had had several of his games published by Strategic Simulations Inc. The game that launched the company was \"Reach for the Stars\" (1983). This games is credited for having \"effectively launched the genre of 4-X space games - explore, expand, exploit, exterminate\". Its success was followed by a string of other, mostly historical military games published throughout the 1980s for Apple II, Atari, Commodore 64, and IBM PC series of computers.\n\nTitles included \"Reach for the Stars\", \"Battlefront,\" \"Battles in Normandy,\" \"\", \"Europe Ablaze,\" \"MacArthur's War,\" \"Carriers at War,\" (in three volumes), \"Rommel,\" \"Gold of the Americas,\" and \"Decisive Battles of the American Civil War\" (in three volumes, with the first being \"\"). Several of these titles were also released for 16-bit platforms including the Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS and Macintosh during the late 1980s.\n\nFrom the outset SSG titles were characterised by a challenging level of intelligence (AI) in the computer opponents provided in the games. Many of the games included scenario editors. For a time SSG published a tie-in magazine, \"Run 5\", that included articles on historical background to the games, game design, game play and data for setting up new or variant scenarios. Subscribers received a disk with the scenario files already created.

It is now relatively well known from photographs and submersible observations, and seems to prefer to perch on the ooze using much elongated fin rays in the tail and two pelvic fins to stand, facing upstream with the pectoral fins turned forward so the outthrust projecting fin rays resemble multiple antennae, and are indeed used as tactile organs. \"B. grallator\" is hermaphroditic. At least 18 species are placed in the genus \"Bathypterois\", several of which have similar appearance and behavior to \"B. grallator\". \"B. grallator\" is the largest member of its genus, commonly exceeding a standard length of and reaching up to .\n\nThe tripodfish, also known as the tripe, has long, bony rays that stick out below its tail fin and both pelvic fins. The fish's head-and-body is up to long, but its fins can be more than . Most of the time, the tripodfish stands on its three fins on the bottom of the ocean, hunting for food. Even though the fins are presumably quite stiff, researchers have been successful in surprising the fish into swimming, and then the fins seem flexible. Scientists have suggested that fluids are pumped into these fins when the fish is 'standing' to make them more rigid.\n\n\"Bathypterois grallator\" has been found relatively widely in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans from 40°N to 40°S. It is a wide-ranging eurybathic fish found from deep.\n\nThe tripodfish uses tactile and mechanosensory cues to identify food; it apparently does not have special visual adaptations to help it find food in the low-light environment. When the fish is perched with its long rays on the ocean floor, it can get food without even seeing it. The tripodfish's mouth ends up at just the right height to catch shrimp, tiny fish, and small crustaceans swimming by. They seem to prefer to perch on the mud using much elongated fin rays in their tails and two pelvic fins to stand, facing upstream into the current to ambush with the pectoral fins turned forward so the outthrust projecting fins resemble multiple antennae. The fish senses objects in the water with its front fins. These fins act like hands. Once they feel prey and realize it is edible, the fins knock the food into the fish's mouth. The fish faces into the current, waiting for prey to drift by.\n\nEach individual has male and female reproductive organs. If two tripodfish happen to meet, they mate. However, if a tripodfish does not find a partner, it makes both sperm and eggs to produce offspring by itself.\n\nAt least 18 species included in the genus \"Bathypterois\". Similar species are often observed in the same areas. A 2001 report included observations of \"Bathypterois dubius\" as far as 50°N in the Bay of Biscay.\n\nA striking parallel exists between some icefishes and the tripodfishes. The stance of \"Chionodraco\" is an even more striking parallel. Both icefishes and the tripodfish use a similar strategy of sitting motionless above the substrate with the attendant benefits that motionlessness brings to a nonvisual, particularly mechanosensory, function.\n\nThe tripodfish is closely related to the spider fish \"Bathypterois longifilis\", which is similar in appearances and habits but is smaller and has much shorter fin extensions. They are often found standing very close to each other. The family to which both fish belong, Inopidae, is called the family of tripod fishes or spiderfishes interchangeably.\n\n"}
{"id": "1936651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936651", "title": "Apostolic visitor", "text": "Apostolic visitor\n\nIn the Catholic Church, an apostolic visitor (or \"Apostolic Visitator\"; Italian: Visitatore apostolico) is a papal representative with a transient mission to perform a canonical visitation of relatively short duration. The visitor is deputed to investigate a special circumstance in a diocese or country, and to submit a report to the Holy See at the conclusion of the investigation.\n\nApostolic visitors are church officials whom canonists commonly class with papal legates. Visitors differ from other Apostolic delegates, principally in this, that their mission is only transient and of comparatively short duration.\n\nIn ancient times, the popes generally exercised their right of inspecting the dioceses of various countries through their nuncios or delegates (c. 1, Extravag. Comm. de Consuet. I, 1; c. 17, X, de Cens. III, 39), though they occasionally, even in the primitive ages, sent special visitors.\n\nIn the modern time, the mission of papal nuncios is rather of a diplomatic than of a visitatorial character. Visitors are, however, deputed by the pope for special emergencies and not at stated intervals. Their duty is to inspect the state of the Church in the country confided to them and then to draw up a report to the Holy See. At times, this visitation is made with the same attention to details as is an episcopal visitation.\n\nVisitors Apostolic are also appointed to visit the various provinces of a religious order, whenever, in the judgment of the pope, this becomes useful or necessary. In all cases of Apostolic visitation, the pope, through delegates, is putting into effect the supreme and immediate jurisdiction which is his for any and every part of the Church. The exact powers of a visitor can be known only from his brief of delegation. His office ceases as soon as he has submitted his report to the Holy See through the Consistorial Congregation.\n\nFor the city of Rome itself there is a \"permanent\" Commission of the Apostolic Visitation. Established by Urban VIII as one of the Roman congregations under the presidency of the cardinal vicar, it was changed into a commission by Pope Pius X through the Constitution \"Sapienti Consilio\" (29 June 1908). These Apostolic visitors annually inspect the parishes and institutions of Rome and report on their spiritual and financial condition. They pay special attention to the fulfilment of the obligations springing from pious foundations and legacies for Masses and chaplaincies.\n\nIn Eastern Catholic (non-Latin) churches, the office of apostolic visitor can be indefinite and the closest thing to an ordinary for communities in regions which have not (yet) been organized into any ordinary jurisdiction. Although there is a history of apostolic visitors in the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church, Eastern Catholic apostolic visitors are generally found in the major Eastern Catholic churches.\n\nBecause the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church (Byzantine Rite) remains unorganized in terms of structural polity, with no proper jurisdictions of its own erected, since 1960 the Pope has entrusted the pastoral care of Belarusian Greek Catholics to a series of Apostolic Visitors. These apostolic visitors have thus served as the only hierarchs of the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church during this time period.\n\nIn recent years, nearly all of the Patriarchal and Major Archiepiscopal Eastern Catholic churches (except the Coptic) have made use of apostolic visitors, mostly in Europe and the Americas. This has sometimes served as a prelude to the creation of an apostolic exarchate or an eparchy. The apostolic visitors are almost always bishops, but only a few of them have a full-time mandate as apostolic visitors. Most of them perform their visitation in addition to some other more primary ecclesiastical role, whether as a residential bishop, an auxiliary bishop, a curial bishop, or their particular church's procurator at Rome.\n\nSince 1986, the Armenian Catholic eparchs of Paris (whose eparchy covers all of France) have served as Apostolic Visitor in Western Europe of the Armenians:\n\nThe Chaldean Catholic Church has had an Apostolic Visitor in Europe of the Chaldeans since 2005:\n\nThe Melkite Greek Catholic Church currently has one apostolic visitor:\n\nThe Romanian Greek Catholic Church currently has one apostolic visitor:\n\nThe Syriac Catholic Church currently has two Apostolic Visitors:\n\nThe Syriac Maronite Church currently has five apostolic visitors:\n\nThe Syro-Malabar Catholic Church has had a number of apostolic visitors over the last several decades, including two at present:\n\nThe Syro-Malankara Catholic Church has had a number of apostolic visitors over the last few decades, three of whom served as apostolic visitors for two different regions simultaneously. Partly due to the canonical erection of several new eparchies and apostolic exarchates, however, there are currently no Syro-Malankara apostolic visitors at present:\n\nThe Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church had several apostolic visitors in Western Europe after the end of World War II and currently has three apostolic visitors:\n\n"}

He previously served the bench coach for the Kansas City Royals. As a player, Sveum saw action in twelve major league seasons between 1986 and 1999. He was a member of the Milwaukee Brewers, Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, Pittsburgh Pirates, and New York Yankees. Following his playing career, Sveum managed in minor league baseball for several seasons before becoming an MLB coach. Sveum briefly served as manager of the Brewers in 2008. He was named manager of the Cubs after the 2011 season. His cousin is former Blue Jays All-Star John Olerud.\n\nDuring his time at Pinole Valley High School, Sveum was recognized as an All-State and All-American quarterback, in addition to playing baseball and basketball. Drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round (25th pick) of the 1982 amateur draft, he went on to play 12 seasons in MLB, hitting .236 with 69 home runs.\n\nArguably, Sveum's finest season came in , when he hit 25 home runs and drove in 95 runs, mostly as the Brewers' ninth hitter in the lineup. One of his personal highlights came early in the season, when he hit a walk-off home run at County Stadium to give Milwaukee a 6–4 victory over the Texas Rangers. This victory, which came on April 19 (Easter Sunday), led the Brewers to a 12–0 record on the season. On July 17 Sveum totaled three homers and six RBIs during a 12–2 thumping of the California Angels.\n\nOn September 3, 1988, Sveum was involved in a severe collision with fellow Brewer Darryl Hamilton. Sveum's leg was broken and he did not play again in . He also sat out the entire MLB season, while seeing action in 17 games in the minor leagues. In his first three major league seasons, Sveum's lowest yearly batting average was .242 Following his return to the majors in 1990, he only batted over .241 twice in parts of nine seasons.\n\nDuring his career Sveum had the distinction of playing for five separate managers who would\n(at some point in their careers) win a league Manager of the Year Award. Those managers were Tony La Russa ('83, '88, '92, '02), in Oakland; Joe Torre ('96, '98), in New York; Lou Piniella ('95, '01, '08), in Seattle; Jim Leyland ('90, '92, '06) in Pittsburgh; and Gene Lamont ('93) with the Chicago White Sox.\n\nPrior to coaching in Milwaukee, Sveum managed the Double A team in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization from 2001–2003, compiling a 213–211 record. In 2003, Baseball America tabbed Sveum as the best potential MLB manager in the Eastern League.\n\nSveum was on the coaching staff of the Boston Red Sox from 2004–05, serving as third base coach and working under manager (and former Brewers teammate) Terry Francona. Following Sveum's second season in Boston, he left the Red Sox to rejoin Milwaukee as the team's bench coach. \n\nOn October 30, 2007, Sveum switched positions on the staff and became the team's third base coach. On September 15, 2008, he was named interim manager of the Milwaukee Brewers after manager Ned Yost was fired. Sveum led the team to a 7–5 record to close out the 2008 regular season, which was enough for the Brewers to make the playoffs for the first time since their World Series run in 1982. Under Sveum's leadership, the Brewers lost the 2008 NLDS to the Philadelphia Phillies in 4 games. As Ken Macha took over the Brewers for the 2009 season, Sveum stayed on as the team's hitting coach.\n\nOn November 16, 2011 the Chicago Cubs offered Sveum their vacant managerial position. The following day, on November 17, 2011, Sveum accepted an offer to become the new manager of the Chicago Cubs, and was introduced on November 18, 2011, but Sveum was fired on September 30, 2013. His total record with the Cubs in two years was 127-197. On August 16, 2017, Sveum received a World Series ring from the team.\n\nOn October 3, 2013 the Kansas City Royals announced they had hired Sveum and added him to their 2014 coaching staff as third base coach. On May 29, 2014, the Royals promoted Sveum to hitting coach in an effort to improve a lackluster offensive start to the season.\n\n<br>\n"}

They inhabit savanna-like habitats, woodland and forest margins, but avoid dense humid forest such as the Amazon.\n\nThis species is officially called a parakeet by the AOU and by birders, though usually called conures in aviculture.\n\n\"acuticaudatus\" is the only species in the monotypic genus \"Thectocercus\"\n\nThe blue-crowned parakeet has five subspecies:\n\nPreviously, this species was part of the genus \"Aratinga\", but that genus was split in four distinct genera once various phylogenetic studies showed that the genus, as traditionally defined, was polyphyletic.\n\nThe blue-crowned parakeet is a medium-sized bird measuring approximately in length and weighing between .\n\nBlue-crowns are born with red coloring around the head, but blue-crowns are predominantly green, with dull blue coloring on the forehead, crown, cheeks, and ears in the nominate, but less blue in other subspecies. It has a ring of white featherless skin around each eye, though this is bright orange-yellow in wild \"T. acuticaudata neumanni\". The breast feathers may also be tinged with blue, though they are more commonly green to yellow-green. Closed wing coloring matches that of the body while extended wings show blue-brown, becoming chestnut on the outer flight feathers. The tail feathers are green on top, maroon to red-brown on the underside, iridescing to bright orange and scarlet under full-spectrum light. Legs are pink-brown with grey-brown claws. The upper mandible is horn-colored, tapering to a needle-sharp, grey-black tip. In the southern and western nominate and subspecies \"neumanni\", the lower mandible is horn-colored in juveniles, fading to grey-black by the bird's second year. The remaining eastern, central and northern subspecies retain the horn-colored lower mandible throughout adulthood.\n\nThe blue-crowned parakeet's nest is a hole in a tree. The eggs are white and there are usually three to four in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for 26 days, and the chicks fledge from the nest about 52 days after hatching.\n\nBlue-crowned parakeets are generally called blue-crowned conures in aviculture. They are social birds and are relatively good talkers compared to other conures. They have become quite popular as pets, with a reputation as one of the \"easier\" parrots to care for. However, they are also intelligent, high-energy birds that require a lot of attention and a cage with ample room and toys. They can also be quite loud at times. Consequently, they are more appropriate companions for serious bird enthusiasts rather than the casual birdkeeper.\n\nhttps://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22685648/132058639\nhttps://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/species.jsp?lang=EN&avibaseid=4BE8E5F1B316CC94\n"}
{"id": "1936721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936721", "title": "Northwestel", "text": "Northwestel\n\nNorthwestel Inc. is the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) and long-distance carrier in Northern Canada.\n\nThe earliest telephone service in Northwestel's present-day operating territory was in Dawson City, established during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898. However, this system was not linked into the North American phone network until the 1960s, barring any shortwave radio links. This independent company, Yukon Telephone Syndicate, was purchased by CN Telegraph (CNT) from Northern Light Power and Coal Company of England in 1962 and a dial telephone system was installed later in the 1960s to replace the 1901 magneto board. Robert W. Service was one of the few Dawson residents able to afford telephone service during his residence in Dawson prior to World War I.\n\nAt least one other independent company was established in Whitehorse and was able to trace its service back to 1900. The Mayo Utilities Company was established in 1920, providing telephone, electricity and water in Mayo and Elsa/Keno City. It was sold in 1942, and the owner sold off the electric and water operations and joined it with the Whitehorse company to form the Yukon Telephone Company.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Corps of Signals established long-distance shortwave telegraphic communications stations in the north in 1923, prior to World War II. Their function was to enable the relay of telegraphic messages to and from the wired CN and CP telegraph networks in the south. From 1959 to March 1960, the stations were handed off to the federal Department of Transport; the stations by 1972 were redundant to fully developed CNT local and long-distance telephone service with access to CN Telegram service via the telephone operator.\n\nIn 1942, the United States Army erected the first terrestrial long-distance system in the form of a pole line along the Alaska Highway. Components normally taking months to build were assembled in weeks.\n\nAlthough limited in capacity, it served after the war as the backbone long-distance network that linked Whitehorse with the south, and provided ringdown magneto phones to highway establishments.\n\nThis US Army system was turned over, April 1, 1946, to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). In 1948, the RCAF turned it over to the federal Department of Transport (DOT), which contracted the operation to Canadian National Telegraphs (CNT).\n\nOther independent companies were established in Yellowknife in 1947, Fort Smith, and Hay River in the late 1950s. These systems were all purchased by CNT during the 1961-1964 period.\n\nThe independent Yellowknife Telephone Company, its formation begun in the spring of 1947 with a buy-in of $50 per share, has its own colourful history. In order to obtain the franchise, they needed to have 100 telephones operating by December 31 at midnight, but by early December had only 15 connected. They rushed by putting five or six phones in some homes. The inspector attempted to call 100 numbers and received 100 answers, although only a quarter were functioning properly. Service was problematic, with many unhappy customers, and up to ten people were partied on a line. By 1958, the Yellowknife company's service improved, with 700 phones hooked up.\n\nDuring the 1950s, one of the major shareholders in Yellowknife, Jim Mason, learned that there were second-hand cables for sale from a Stewart, BC, company. The owner had died and his brother, the executor, not knowing much about the company, accepted an offer of $1,000 for the cables, to be shipped by the executor. The cables arrived at a desperate time, long after they were expected, allowing an upgrade of the lines, and turned out to be worth $35,000.\n\nAn opportunity for CNT to acquire federal government telephone services in the Dawson Creek-Fort St. John, BC, area was not acted on, and on 1 July 1956, those areas, through which CNT later ran a microwave line, became owned by the North-west Telephone Company, which was associated with the B.C. Telephone Company.\n\nIn October 1958, CNT purchased the Whitehorse-based Yukon Telephone Company, and also purchased the DOT system (established by the U.S. Army) outright. From there, it began to develop a complete public telephone exchange service in the Yukon.\n\nWhitehorse converted from partial dial to full dial service on October 31, 1960. After this date, local communities' ring-down phones were replaced with local exchange service, using surplus central office switches that could be acquired at a relatively low cost. The wire line facilities along the highway was changed from ring-down services to multi-party lines off dial exchanges as the communities along the line received central office switches, most of which were Ericsson Rurax switches that during the late 1970s were modified to enable direct dialing of long-distance calls, though without automatic number identification. The more remote multi-party lines were switched from wire to Exicom radios, while the Ruraxes were mostly replaced in the mid-1980s with modern solid-state digital switches, though the last Rurax remained in service in Swift River until 1987.\n\nThe three local independent companies in the NWT were connected to the CNT long-distance network by 1961, and additional locations in 1962 as CNT extended its telephone service mandate into the vast NWT (by this time, Bell Canada was operating in Frobisher Bay in the east). In July 1961, CNT purchased the Hay River Telephone Company; on 31 December 1963, CNT purchased the Yellowknife Telephone Company (at $250 per share), and in May 1964, CNT purchased the exchange in Fort Smith.\n\nCirca 1961, the company name was changed from Canadian National Telegraphs to Canadian National Telecommunications.\n\nThe original pole line along the Alaska Highway was overbuilt by a modern analog microwave line that was contracted for between CNT and the US Dept. of Defence on 25 March 1959, completed in 1962. Like much of the northern long-distance infrastructure, a long-term government contract was required to make the cost affordable, in this case, United States military need for a reliable link to its Alaska radar stations. The CNT link joined Alascom microwave facilities with Alberta Government Telephones (now Telus) microwave facilities. Other US Dept. of Defence contracts with CNT resulted in tropospheric scatterwave facilities being installed to link up Distant Early Warning Line sites, along a line stretching from Barrow, Alaska to the east side of Greenland, with a scatterwave antenna in Hay River, NWT. These troposcatter facilities, such as the ones between Elsa, YT and Tsiigehtchic, NT (Arctic Red River) completed in 1960, were also used from the same time to carry civilian long-distance circuits until satellite facilities were implemented in the 1980s.\n\nThe microwave system on the Alaska Highway was inaugurated with a phone call from Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, visiting Whitehorse, to President John F. Kennedy in Washington, D.C.. Later that year, the line's worth was proven in the Cuban Missile Crisis. With the possibility of a nuclear strike by the USSR, the phone company hurriedly dispatched radio technicians to each site, often on a lonely mountaintop, to be ready to restore service in case of a failure. This route was upgraded to modern digital microwave technology in the early 1990s.\n\nDirect distance dialing (DDD) was first introduced in 1972, just 21 years after its initial introduction in Englewood, New Jersey, and 14 years after introduction to Canada at Toronto and Montreal. DDD became available on all but a handful of exchanges by the spring of 1980.\n\nThe pole line remained until the early 1980s, being used for multi-party line service for rural telephone customers, who are now served by point-to-point radio connections for their telephone service. Removal of the wires provoked a small rural protest from people who had hooked their radio sets to the wire to pick up Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio signals that inadvertently were carried along the wires; a Northwestel spokesperson explained in a letter to the editor that they could not knowingly continue to provide a service they were not licensed to provide.\n\nThe company's corporate headquarters were transferred from Edmonton to Whitehorse in 1980. Operations have been diversified with Yellowknife being another prime centre for the company.\n\n\"The years in which Hay River Tel. Co., Fort Smith Tel. Co., and Performance Communications were established is not known by the contributor of this chart.\"\n\nNorthwestel was established in 1979 by its owner, Canadian National Railways, spinning off the \"northwest\" operations of Canadian National Telecommunications (which is not to be confused with CNCP Telecommunications, a joint venture that CP Telegraphs and CN Telegraphs formed). The Newfoundland operation was, the same year, spun off as Terra Nova Tel (TNT). TNT was later purchased by NewTel Enterprises and merged with Newfoundland Telephone in late 1988.\n\nNorthwestel was sold to Bell Canada Enterprises (parent of Bell Canada) on December 1, 1988. Since then, Northwestel has become a direct subsidiary of Bell Canada, although still regulated (by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) separately from Bell Canada, with its own method of regulation until 2007: rate of return. Northwestel, as of 2007, is regulated more closely like all other companies in Canada — price regulation and a split rate base — that is appropriate to the highly competitive environment in which they operate; Northwestel does not have a split rate base, however.\n\nOn December 14, 2011, by way of Telecom Regulatory Policy 2011-711, the CRTC announced that the territory of Northwestel would now be opened to local competition beginning 1 May 2012.\n\nThe company's original service territory was the entire Yukon, plus parts of northern British Columbia, and the western portion of the Northwest Territories, including the Kitikmeot communities of Pelly Bay (now Kugaaruk), Spence Bay (Taloyoak) and Gjoa Haven. On July 1, 1992, the service territory of Bell Canada in the NWT was purchased by Northwestel, bringing the entire north under a single company.\n\nThough technically regarded as an \"independent company\" through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (it was not a member of the Trans-Canada Telephone System or Telecom Canada), the last of seven actual independent companies within Northwestel's operating area were acquired by the company's predecessor CNT in 1964.\n\nA CRTC order in 2003 transferred a small section of Alberta, that had no telephone service, to Northwestel's operating area, as it could better serve the location from Fort Smith than could Telus due to isolation and network cost. Fort Fitzgerald residents initiated the process by appealing to the CRTC; service was installed at the end of 2005, delayed as the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo demanded ongoing access payments for installing the telephone lines, initially at a rate far in excess of the revenue that would be generated by a very small number of customers. The 2003 order had the effect of eliminating an anomaly - Northwestel already had some customers in Alberta adjacent to Fort Smith, though not as far from Fort Smith as Fort Fitzgerald.\n\nIn 2012 Northwestel complied with the CRTC's request for a network modernization plan, which resulted in considerable opposition from northern rival telecoms.\n\nIn February 2013, Northwestel released a revised modernization plan, which president Paul Flaherty explained to the public. But the new plan was criticized by the government of Nunavut and Northwestel's largest competitor SSi Micro.\n\nParallel to this, another regulatory process before the CRTC has been underway regarding the wholesale prices Northwestel is permitted to charge competitors for access to its fibre cable connecting the Northwest Territories to southern Canada.\n\nIn March 2015, the CRTC ordered Northwestel to reduce residential Internet rates in the Northwest Territories, while a final decision regarding wholesale rates is still pending.\n\nCN inherited a mixture of switching technologies, some dial exchanges (Whitehorse, Yellowknife, Hay River, Fort Smith), some manual exchanges (Dawson City). Most settlements had no phone service or only one or two lines from a larger centre. Dial telephone service was ubiquitous by the end of the 1960s wherever a local exchange was established.\n\nMicrowave installations similar to the Alaska Highway route and others in southern Canada replaced outdated or overcrowded pole-line systems on routes paralleling the Yukon's Klondike Highway, and highways in the Northwest Territories, as well as a mammoth pole-line along the Mackenzie River to Inuvik that was only in service from 1968 to 1973. Satellite relays replaced Tropospheric scatterwave systems to DEW-line communities such as Cambridge Bay and Spence Bay, improving signal quality immensely.\nManual Mobile Telephone Service, using VHF frequencies, was introduced by the company along all major highways, the Mackenzie River valley and additional off-road regions, during the 1960-1990 period.\n\nFurther improvements in the 1990s eliminated \"double-hop\" relays between two satellite-served communities, halving the transmission time for a satellite as much as away over the equator. Nevertheless, bad atmosphere conditions can still skip satellite signals out of the atmosphere for far-north points where the antenna points horizontally across the ground. (The effect is similar when looking at an oar in the water, and the oar appears bent.)\n\nUntil the 1980s, Northwestel's current operating area (including the Bell Canada area it acquired in 1992) was characterized by north–south communications and transportation links. Airlines flew mainly north–south. Highways such as the Alaska Highway and the Mackenzie Highway were routed north–south. Telecommunication lines and tropo links routed north–south, following the natural transportation corridors.\n\nAs a result, the area's low requirements were met by long-distance switching as part of southern area codes - 403 in the west and 819 in the east. The Yukon was also covered by 403, not 604, since its lines were handled, prior to Direct Distance Dialing, by operators in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nThe northern British Columbia locations, plus Fort Liard, NT until October 1981, were served by area code 604 so that there would be uniformity of dialing codes within that province. Lower Post, BC, linked with the Watson Lake, YT exchange, was covered by 403 prior to 1979.\n\nIn 1997, the single area code 867 was introduced to replace 403 and 819, although the British Columbia locations, by now serviced by 250, remained on 250. The inauguration of 867 signaled a truly trans-northern communications network that was finally capable of routing calls across the north without having to route through the territories of southern telephone companies.\n\nA Service Improvement Plan (SIP), similar to ones implemented by other Canadian telephone companies, extended basic levels of service to more of the north during the four years starting in 2001.\n\nIn August 2009, Northwestel completed the last leg of fibre from Whitehorse to the south. Until this time, a long section between Fort Nelson, BC, and Mould Creek (near Liard Hot Springs), telecommunications passing through the area were carried over microwave radio. The completion of the fibre link in this area also will allow Northwestel to provide internet service to the communities of Muncho Lake, BC and Toad River, BC. Since the completion of fibre fully to Whitehorse, internet package speeds and transfer caps in Whitehorse have both been increased significantly.\n\nUnlike southern phone companies, Northwestel occasionally must decommission exchanges and facilities in previously active communities that are ceasing to exist. In several cases, a large investment in wiring distribution and exchange infrastructure must be abandoned or removed, and may become surplus (no longer producing revenue to cover its acquisition and installation cost), not being required elsewhere.\n\nPast communities served by Northwestel that have vanished include:\n\nOther communities have been added and then deleted in a short space of years: McDame Lake, BC; Ketza River, Yukon. Elsa survives as a rate centre only because it was eclipsed by relatively stable Keno, which is served by the same exchange.\n\nNorthwestel Cable is a wholly owned subsidiary of Northwestel. Originally approved by the CRTC to provide cable television in numerous communities across the north, the timing was poor as DTH satellite services became available; Northwestel Cable was unable to subscribe enough customers to make systems viable except in Norman Wells; the company also in 1995 purchased the Mackenzie Media cable system in Yellowknife, the Performance Communications Corp. system in Watson Lake and the Pangnirtung Cable T.V. system. In 2005, Northwestel Cable purchased the Fort Nelson, British Columbia system and upgraded it for digital and internet. In August 2006, the system in High Level, Alberta was also purchased and is to be upgraded for digital cable and internet. In September 2007, Northwestel Cable took ownership of the WHTV Cablevision system in Whitehorse, and again, conducted upgrades.\n\nNorthwestel introduced a form of cellular telephony in 1987 with the Aurora (Automated Roving Radio) system (400 MHz band) developed by Novatel and widely used in Alberta. It was available in limited areas, and although intended to replace most of the VHF manual mobile telephone service, the widespread deployment of cellular service (800 MHz band) across southern Canada rendered the Aurora system obsolete, despite Aurora's superior geographic reach. The Aurora system was manufacturer discontinued, and, not being Y2K compatible, was discontinued late in 1999.\n\n800 MHz cellular technology was introduced in 1993, though with far less availability than Aurora in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. The cellular operations were, soon after, spun off as Northwestel Mobility Inc. (NMI Mobility). In 2003, NMI Mobility was sold to Bell Mobility, leaving Northwestel as strictly landline and VHF manual mobile provider. However, it appears to have been since re-acquired by Northwestel.\n\nNorthwestel is now in a joint venture with the Dakwakada Development Corporation (an arm of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations) in Latitude Wireless deployment of cellular in 17 to 19 Yukon communities (with local number blocks in Dawson, Haines Junction, Old Crow and Watson Lake). Latitude Wireless service is also available in eight communities in the Northwest Territories and six in Nunavut, and roaming is available between the Latitude and Bell Mobility networks.\n\nNorthwestel's service area is uniquely recognized by the Canadian regulator, the CRTC, as being entirely a high-cost serving area, characterized by:\n\nAs an example of the low population density, the area of Kluane National Park and Reserve in the southwest Yukon, which has an adjacent population of less than 1,100, is . The Golden Horseshoe of Ontario, the area around Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, is , has some 8.1 million people; the densest portion of of the Golden Horseshoe likely has over 5 million people.\n\nNorthwestel's operating area is one third of Canada's land mass, but only 1/300th of Canada's population. Other phone companies serve much smaller territories and have cities of hundreds of thousands of people. Telus and Bell Canada have cities and urban regions in excess of two million population.\n\nAn example of extraordinary maintenance costs occurred in the late 1990s when wind blew the satellite dish at Grise Fiord off its base and wrecked it, cutting off communications for a community of just a few hundred people. A replacement dish, and installation crew, had to be sent in by air freight charter, and assembled on site. This sort of cost must be covered as \"monopoly local\", supported by carrier access tariff fees, or in the resale prices charged to resellers of local service.\n\nWhile not necessarily a cost factor, an adverse effect of the high latitude is the refraction of radio signals by the atmosphere. At Grise Fiord, the satellite antenna faces horizontally south at the satellite which is located over the equator. The signal from the satellite strikes the atmosphere at such a flat angle that adverse conditions can deflect the signal away from the straight-line required to reach the antenna. The effect is similar to how an oar appears bent at the surface of the water.\n\nAs a result of these factors, long-distance competition arrived some nine years later than in the rest of Canada, and local competition was still not allowed through 2006. In addition, the CRTC recognized the need for external supplementary funding to sustain the company with competition, since it was viewed as essential that Northwestel remain in business to provide basic phone service to all communities it now served.\n\nThe external subsidy allows the company to offer a long-distance plan, to \"all\" communities in its operating area, with a rate of 10 cents per minute for calling within Canada during off-peak hours. Without the subsidy, this low rate could not be offered. The Carrier Access Tariff (CAT) rate was also subsidized at just 7 cents per minute from 2001 to early 2007, and a lower CAT rate would have required even greater subsidy; other Canadian companies can offer lower CAT rates without subsidization. In addition, the \"toll connecting trunks\" (portions of the long-distance networks that connect local exchanges to the long-distance exchanges) are unusually long, and are regarded as part of monopoly local, requiring external subsidy to sustain. Circuit charges are also priced well above cost in order to cross-subsidize non-profitable services such as monopoly local.\n\nConsidering the difficulties of the operating area, Northwestel provides a fairly modern telecommunications network, including a basic level of such features as Call waiting, dial-up Internet, Call Number Display in 58 exchanges (62 communities & localities), and, in the largest centres which are still smaller than Bell Canada's fair-sized towns, video conference services. More advanced features, such as Name Display, are not available, and long-distance transmission of Call Number Display is limited to just 14 communities. They also provide cable services, as \"TheEdge\", with television and DSL Internet in some communities, many of them with government assistance. As NetKaster they also provide Two-way Satellite Internet access to Alberta and parts of the NWT and Nunavut and planned expansion in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Yukon.\n\nThe CRTC initiated a proceeding on January 17, 2006 (Telecom Public Notice CRTC 2006-1) to review the regulatory framework for Northwestel, with a decision for a new framework issued in 2007 to go within 60 days. The CRTC examined moving Northwestel from rate-of-return regulation to price regulation, or a transitional regime. It also examined the possibility of local service competition (and under what conditions), possible split of rate base between competitive and utility, further SIP proposals, and status of long-distance competition and the setting of the CAT rate.\n\nThe strongest opposition to the proposal by Northwestel came from Telus. The proposal envisioned a substantial increase in supplemental funding in order to shift from an implicit subsidy (circuit charges far above cost) to an explicit subsidy (charges closer to parity with elsewhere in Canada); there would also have been a major cut in the 7 cent-per-minute CAT rate to a new switch connect rate lower than one cent per minute, again replacing an implicit subsidy with an explicit subsidy through supplemental funding. Consumer groups expressed concern about the price-cap regime, suggesting continued regulation. Various groups expressed concern about the unknown long-distance rate reductions, as for competitive reasons, neither Northwestel nor the CRTC could disclose the specifics.\n\nThe CRTC issued its decision (Telecom Decision 2007-5) on February 2, 2007, following an interim order issued on December 6, 2006 that allowed the first raise in basic network service rates since 2001 (residence customers face an increase of $2.00, equal to 1.11 percent per year over six years). The approved switch connect rate will be $0.0415 per minute per end; local service resale was approved; Toll Free remains regulated; other toll services will now be excluded from regulation; a new SIP program to replace outdated and Industry Canada-non compliant transmission networks was not approved.\n\nThe company announced its new long-distance plans on 21 March 2007, after adjusting its original plans to reflect the CRTC-approved rates and regime. The timing of the CRTC decision conflicted with the company's temporary loss of staff for volunteer activity at the Canada Winter Games.\n\nFurther CRTC proceedings in late 2011 opened the Northwestel service area to facilities-based local service competition, with limited availability of number portability. There was a small reduction in the switch connect rate which remains the highest in Canada. Again, a further service improvement plan, including replacing a radio-based line service in Upper Halfway River, B.C., and non-compliant microwave radio systems, was rejected by the CRTC. CLECs may offer service as from 1 May 2012; one hopeful competitor, SSi Micro, was seeking CRTC remedies for rates for data transport while other potential competitors began preparing for to enter the northern market.\n\nOn May 28, 2012 it was announced that Iristel, one of Canada's largest Voice over IP networks (VoIP), would be the first CLEC to enter the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut through a partnership with ICE Wireless. Samer Bishay, president of both Ice Wireless and Iristel, considered it to be the official end of Northwestel's long standing monopoly in northern Canada.\n\nList of Canadian telephone companies\n\n\n"}

He began studying the violin at the age of six and was the last student of the late Professor Ilona Feher. He is also a violin teacher, and a professor at the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music (formerly the Samuel Rubin Israel Academy of Music), in the Faculty of Arts at Tel Aviv University.\n\nAs a soloist he has performed with many of the world's major orchestras, including the English Chamber Orchestra, BBC Philharmonic, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland, Belgian National Orchestra, Orchestre Symphonique Francais, National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra, Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra, Slovak Philharmonic, and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra under Zubin Mehta. In 1985 he was invited to join Isaac Stern and Pinchas Zukerman in a gala concert at Carnegie Hall, following which Zubin Mehta invited him to perform Brahms' Double Concerto at Carnegie Hall. In 2006 Hagai Shaham was again invited by Zubin Mehta to play Brahms' Double Concerto, together with cellist Mischa Maisky, to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nHe also performs as a recitalist and appears in chamber music performances. He regularly tours throughout Europe, and North and South America, performing at international recital series and festivals.\n\nHe has recorded on the Biddulph, Hyperion Records, Avie, Naxos Records, Talent, and more labels, music of Achron, Bloch, Brahms, Hubay, Grieg, Mozart, and more.\n\nHagai Shaham has found unpublished compositions of Joseph Achron (1886–1943) at the National Library at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and performed and recorded them (short pieces, some appearing for the first time). A CD was published in 1997 by \"Biddulph Recordings,\" London. An expanded version of this CD, with Achron's complete suites for violin and piano (2 CDs) has been published by \"Hyperion\" in 2012.\n\nSome quotes from reviews:\n\n\"The quasi-mystical intensity of Shaham's reading throbs like Heifetz's with the ecstasy of ritual declamation. His off-the-string bowings strike sparks, and his rapid passage work glitters; but ... he also communicates the mystery of more somber numbers. His powerful tone ... intensifies the effect of both the soaring Romantic and the insinuating Hebrew passages ... an impressive a technique as anyone except Heifetz could bring\" - \"Fanfare Magazine\"\n\n\"An exceptionally welcome release ... outstanding lyric quality ... Through the richness of his tone, superior vibrato usage, expressiveness of phrasing and top-drawer facility, he fulfills his potential in striking fashion. It is a treat to hear such tonally satisfying violin playing when commonplace sound, even among accomplished artists, is so prevalent\" - \"The Strad Magazine\"\n\n\"Shaham's approach achieves and ideal balance between expressive colouring ... and collaborative restraint. Hagai Shaham inhabits the same stylistic world as his great forebearers. He obviously respects past masters, and yet his playing eschews specific imitation (in his handling of those pieces recorded by Heifetz, Elman, Kaufman and others)\" - \"Gramophone Magazine\"\n\nAbout half of Joseph Achron's compositions (over 100 total) were unpublished in his lifetime (1886–1943). By sheer luck the manuscripts have been saved from disposal and arrived in the Hebrew University (see more in the CD's elaborated notes, in English, Hebrew, and Yiddish).\n\nCombined with his career as a performer Hagai Shaham teaches violin playing and conducts master classes, primarily in Israel and Europe. He was a faculty member of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance. In 2007, he joined the music faculty at the renowned Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California (USC; where Jasha Heifetz has taught violin playing). Since 2009 he has been a professor at the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music (formerly the Samuel Rubin Israel Academy of Music), in the Faculty of Arts at Tel Aviv University. He is currently teaching at Stony Brook University in Long Island, NY. In the summer months, he teaches at the Heifetz International Music Institute in Staunton, VA.\n\nShaham is online Master Teacher at iClassical Academy with whom he has recorded several online Masterclasses.\n\nIn September 1990, Hagai Shaham and his duo partner Arnon Erez won the first prize at the ARD International Music Competition in Munich in the Violin-Piano duo category, the first competitors to be awarded this coveted first prize since 1971. His other awards include first prizes at the Ilona Kornhouser competition, the Israeli Broadcasting Authority Young Artist competition, The Tel-Aviv Rubin Academy competition, four Clairmont Awards, and annual scholarship from the American-Israel Cultural Foundation.\n\nHagai Shaham is a co-founder of the Ilona Feher Foundation.\n\nHe is married and has three children.

After graduating from Princeton High School, he completed his education at the University of South Alabama. The St. Louis Cardinals drafted him in 6th round of the 1984 amateur draft. In 1986, he led the Class AA Arkansas Travelers with 82 runs, 129 hits, 6 triples, and a league-leading 49 stolen bases. At the age of 24, Johnson broke into the big leagues on July 10, 1987, In 1987 Johnson, playing for the Louisville Redbirds, was the American Association Most Valuable Player. From 1988 to 1995 Johnson played for the Chicago White Sox.\n\nJohnson is the only player in the history of Major League Baseball to lead both the American League and the National League in hits, and he did it in back-to-back seasons. He led the American League in hits in 1995 for the White Sox, and he led the National League in hits in 1996 for the Mets.\n\nFrom 1991 through 1994, Johnson led the American League in triples, becoming the first player in Major League history to lead his league in triples for four consecutive years. In 1996, he led the National League in triples, becoming the third player in history to lead both leagues in triples (Sam Crawford and Brett Butler being the first two).\nAlso one of three major leaguers (the other two are Joe Carter and Steve Sax) to lead both leagues in at bats two consecutive years. The Chicago White Sox in 1995 and with the New York Mets in 1996, making him the only major leaguer to lead both leagues in at bats, hits and triples.\nAs of 2013, he is one of only four players (Crawford, Stan Musial, and Willie Wilson) to lead the league in triples as many as five times. He is also one of a handful of players to collect three triples in one game, doing so on September 23, 1995 in the White Sox' 14-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The three triples were part of a 6-for-6 performance for Johnson, who became the first White Sox to collect six hits in one game since Floyd Robinson in 1962.\n\nHis finest season came in 1996 with the New York Mets. That year, he accumulated 227 hits, 21 triples (the highest single season total in that category since 1985), 50 steals, 31 doubles (the only season in which he accumulated at least 20), 69 Runs Batted In, 117 runs scored, and a .333 batting average, all career highs. This was Johnson's only season in which he was selected for the All Star team.\n\nAfter the Mets, he played with the Chicago Cubs from 1997 to 1999. He was slowed down by injuries during his years with the Cubs and in 2000, he finally ended his career after the New York Yankees sent him to the minor leagues in mid-season. The Yankees won the World Series that year and Johnson was given a World Series ring for his service to the team.\n\nIn 1447 games over 14 seasons, Johnson posted a .291 batting average (1565-for-5379) with 767 runs, 175 doubles, 117 triples, 34 home runs, 486 RBI, 327 stolen bases, 352 bases on balls, .334 on-base percentage and .386 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .983 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. In 11 postseason games, Johnson hit .200 (7-for-35) with 3 runs, 1 home run, 7 RBI and 3 stolen bases.\n\nHis speed on the base paths, and his uniform number \"1\", earned him the endearing nickname \"One Dog\". \"One Dog\" is also the name of the record company he had during his MLB career.\n\nHe now resides in Alabama with his wife.\n\n"}

Lynda, and her sister Denyce (born 1952), lost their father when she was 10, when he died of heart failure. Lynda and her mother were never close, and Block claimed that her mother was both physically and mentally abusive.\n\nHer second husband, George Sibley (September 8, 1942 - August 4, 2005), claimed that a constant trait of Block was charity. While living in Key West she served as Secretary of the Humane Society, and also as animal abuse investigator. She was also active in civic work besides her service to the Humane Society: for two years she served as president of the Friends of the Library in Key West and served as publicity director for a mayoral candidate.\n\nBefore the crime that led to her conviction and transfer to Alabama's death row, Block published \"Liberatis\", a political magazine. She came from such a high social standing that many were shocked to learn of her crime.\n\nOn October 4, 1993, Lyon's common law husband, George Sibley, and Lyon's nine-year-old son were in a parked car in the parking lot of a Walmart store in Opelika, Alabama. A passer-by expressed concern for Lyon's son to Opelika Police Sergeant Roger Motley, saying it appeared to her as if the boy wanted help. She also believed the family could be living in the vehicle. At that time, Sibley and Lyon were on the run from the law in Florida after failing to appear for sentencing on an assault charge against Block's ex-husband. Motley found Sibley's car, parked behind and approached it, and asked for Sibley's license.\n\nBy Sibley's own account, he was explaining to Motley his personal theory that he was not required to have one, when he observed Motley placing his hand on his gun. Sibley then drew his gun and began shooting at Motley, who returned fire, wounding Sibley. Motley took cover behind his patrol car; witnesses stated Sibley fired first. Block was at a payphone when she heard the gunfire. She drew her gun and witnesses stated that she was in a crouched position when she fired. Block claimed that she fired just as she stopped running toward Motley. As Motley turned to face Block, she fired again, hitting him in the chest. Motley, who had given his bulletproof vest to another officer, was mortally wounded.\n\nPart of an anti-government movement or \"sovereign citizen movement\", Block and Sibley had renounced their citizenship and destroyed their birth certificates, driver's licenses, and Social Security cards. They refused to cooperate with their court-appointed attorneys, maintaining that they had acted in self-defense. They also maintained that Alabama did not have the authority to try them as it was not properly re-admitted into the Union after the American Civil War. Although it could not be determined who fired the fatal shot, they were both convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.\n\nBlock, Alabama Institutional Serial #Z575, entered death row on December 21, 1994. While on death row, she was held at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka, Alabama.\n\nDuring her time on death row, Block was interviewed by writer Tahir Shah, who included her reflections in his book \"Travels With Myself\", in the chapter entitled \"Women on Death Row\". In her very candid responses, Block reflects on the incident that got her sentenced to death, her reaction upon hearing the sentence, and what it was like to live on death row. Shah also shared a video on his YouTube channel, also titled \"Women on Death Row,\" where he discusses his experience interviewing Block on death row.\n\nBlock was executed on May 10, 2002. Her execution occurred at the Holman Correctional Facility near Atmore, Alabama.\n\nBefore the execution, three friends visited Lyon for several hours. Lyon also saw a spiritual adviser. She had not requested a last meal, nor did she make a final statement. At approximately 12:00 midnight, she was placed in the electric chair and at 12:01 a.m., the current was turned on. At 12:10 a.m., she was pronounced dead. She was the last person to be electrocuted in Alabama and the first woman executed in the state since 1957.\n\nSibley filed a hand-written petition asking the Alabama Supreme Court to block his execution, claiming that Lyon had fired the shot that killed Motley. He was executed on August 4, 2005 by lethal injection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1936742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936742", "title": "Elmira Jackals", "text": "Elmira Jackals\n\nThe Elmira Jackals were a professional minor league ice hockey team based in Elmira, New York. They were members of the United Hockey League from 2000 to 2007 and the ECHL from 2007 to 2017. The Jackals played their home games at the First Arena.\n\nOn March 10, 2017, after unsuccessfully trying to the sell the team and the arena, the Chemung County Industrial Development Agency made an agreement to sell the arena to Brian Barrett but not the Jackals. The Jackals would fold after the end of the season.\n\nThe Jackals were founded as a member of the United Hockey League before the 2000–01 season and were affiliated with the National Hockey League's Columbus Blue Jackets. Eventually, they severed ties with the Blue Jackets and were unaffiliated for the rest of their years in the UHL. During this time, their average attendance was 3,080 per game and they had 31 sellouts. Their largest crowd was a standing-room of 4,000, on October 13, 2006.\n\nPrior to their first season, their home arena was still not complete and the Jackals spent the first 10 games of their inaugural season on the road. The Jackals returned to their unfinished arena in Elmira for their first home game, on November 11, 2000. The arena still had a crowd of 3,378 in the Jackals' 5–2 win. Overall, the Jackals finished that season 32–33–9 for second place in the Northeast Division and a berth in the UHL playoffs. Elmira was named franchise of the year for the UHL. The Jackals lost in the first round.\nIn their second season, the Jackals earned a 45–21–8 record with 98 points for first in the East in the regular season. In the playoffs, they won Eastern Conference Championship before falling to the Muskegon Fury in the Colonial Cup finals four-games-to-two. The Jackals returned the Colonial Cup finals again two years later in 2004. They once again lost to the Fury in a four-game sweep.\n\nIn 2004–05, the Jackals fired head coach Todd Brost mid-season after posting a 19–35–5 record. Brost was replaced by former Philadelphia Flyers' tough guy Dave Schultz but then posted a 5–16–0 record. The Jackals did not qualify for the playoffs for the first time. Shultz was then replaced by Perry Florio for the 2005–06 season. After another unsuccessful season, the Jackals hired a new general manager, Robbie Nichols, and a new coach, Kris Waltze. At the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Waltze posted a 13–13–0 record before being demoted to assistant coach and Nichols taking over as head coach. Nichols led the team to a 9–12–1 before he suffered a minor stroke during an away game. Paul Gillis then filled in as head coach for the remainder of the season where the Jackals would finish last in the division.\n\nDuring the 2007 offseason, the Jackals joined the ECHL with a new logo, jerseys and coach Steve Martinson. They became affiliates of the National Hockey League's Columbus Blue Jackets and American Hockey League's Syracuse Crunch. Returning from a loss in Cincinnati, the team bus was involved in crash on Interstate 90 in Pennsylvania early in the morning of November 29, 2007, where several players sustained minor injuries. After three seasons of being out of playoff contention in the United Hockey League, the Jackals qualified for the 2008 Kelly Cup playoffs. The Jackals completed the season with a 41–24–0–7 with 89 points to finish second in the North Division. However, their success was short lived as they lost in the conference quarterfinals to the Reading Royals, 4-games-to-2.\n\nThe Jackals severed ties with the Blue Jackets and Crunch at the conclusion of the 2007–08 season and became the affiliates of the NHL's Ottawa Senators and AHL's Binghamton Senators. During the 2008–09 regular season, the Jackals went 39–26–2–5 for 85 points to finish third in the North Division. The Jackals were able to clinch a playoff berth but fell in the second round to the Cincinnati Cyclones, 4-games-to-0. The team further improved under Martinson during the 2009–10 regular season when the Jackals finished first in the East Division and made the ECHL playoffs for the third straight season. However, the Jackals fell in the first round to the Florida Everblades, 4-games-to-1.\n\nIn 2010, the Jackals affiliated with the NHL's Anaheim Ducks and their AHL affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, giving the Jackals a dual NHL affiliation for the first time (as they were still affiliated the Senators). Head coach Steve Martinson, who had been with the franchise since its inaugural year in the ECHL, signed with the Chicago Express, a new expansion team of the ECHL, leaving Elmira with a 117–76–23 record. Malcolm Cameron succeeded Martinson as head coach before the 2010–11 season but was replaced mid-season by former coach and general manager Robbie Nichols. The Jackals finished the season with a third-place finish in the North Division and their fourth consecutive ECHL playoff berth but fell in the first round to the Greenville Road Warriors, 3-games-to-1.\n\nPat Bingham was then hired as head coach for the 2011–12 season. On February 21, 2012, the Jackals season was threatened after the Arena owner failed to pay $136,234 in taxes for three years and being hit with a foreclosure order by Chemung County. The Jackals continued to play not knowing if or when they would be locked out by the County. Jackals and First Arena's general manager, Robbie Nichols, and assistant general manager, Don Lewis, were fired in January 2012 and replaced by Matt Hufnagel. The operator of First Arena filed two lawsuits, one against Nichols and Lewis and the other against Chemung County, the County Executive, County Treasurer and Southern Tier Economic Development. This statement by the owner's lawyers was released: \"The truth will come out. Fact of the matter is the money was here to pay the taxes. And the fact is Robbie Nichols told the Afrs it was paid.\" Afr, the Jackals and First Arena owner requested that the Legislature hold off their vote until June 30, 2012, to continue the foreclosure proceedings. On the ice, the Jackals had their best ECHL season and Bingham led the Jackals to a 45–22–5 record and captured the Eastern Conference regular season title. The Jackals advanced to the 2012 Kelly Cup playoffs for their fifth straight season, falling in the second round to the Florida Everblades, 4-games-to-1.\n\nOn May 30, 2012, the County entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Elmira Downtown Arena and Southern Tier Economic Development to allow Elmira Downtown Arena to continue operating the First Arena for the 2012–13 season. The Legislature ratified the agreement on July 9, 2012. On July 24, 2012, the County announced that First Arena would be sold to local businessman Tom Freeman, at the completion of the 2012–13 season. On September 8, 2012, Jackals head coach Pat Bingham resigned one month before the season started. The Jackals were able to find a quick replacement by announcing Dwight Mullens as the team's new coach.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, the Jackals held a press conference to name Tom Freeman and Nathan Cook the new owners of the First Arena and the Jackals. Now under the new ownership, the Jackals completed the 2013–14 season with a 24–40–3–5 record and third place in the Atlantic Division but missed the playoffs for the first time since joining the ECHL in 2007.\n\nThe Devils decided to not renew their affiliation with the Jackals for the 2014–15 season and the Jackals would also not renew their affiliation agreement with the NHL's Ottawa Senators. Instead, they signed a multi-year agreement to be the ECHL affiliate of the NHL's Buffalo Sabres and the AHL's Rochester Americans. The Jackals would also hire Jamie Russell as head coach. At the start of the season, the Jackals announced that they were now \"community owned.\" Any profit above operating cost would be turned over to a local board of directors who would decide how the money should be invested in the community. However, despite an increase in average attendance from 2,200 in 2013–14 to 2,557 in 2014–15, the team still lost money. The owner indicated that an attendance of 3,200 would have been the break-even point for a profit. In 2015–16, the Jackals set a team record of 21 road wins, missed the playoffs for the third straight year, and the average attendance was still only 2,500 per game.\n\nOn April 28, 2016, the Chemung County Executive announced that the Chemung County Industrial Development Agency (IDA) would assume temporary ownership of First Arena and the Jackals until a new owner can be found. The move was made due to the ongoing team losses and the ability to pay rent to the Arena combined with the County's interest in maintaining the viability of the arena and the team. The IDA announced they would use $1 million to pay off team debts so any new owner can have a nearly clean financial slate.\n\nAfter the 2015–16 season, head coach Jamie Russell left the organization after two seasons and no playoff appearances. On July 25, 2016, the Jackals announced David Leger as the new head coach for the 2016–17 season. Under Leger, the team struggled and was in last place in the league, leading management to release him on January 13, 2017. He was replaced by assistant coach Mike Duco on an interim basis.\n\nOn March 10, 2017, the IDA announced that it had an agreement to sell First Arena to local businessman Brian Barrett. As part of the agreement, it was announced that the Elmira Jackals would cease operations at the end of the season. The Jackals played their final game on April 8, a 5–0 loss at home to the Adirondack Thunder.\n\nBy June 2017, Barrett backed out of the negotiations with the county and First Arena remained operated by the IDA. One year later, the Federal Hockey League expanded to Elmira with the Elmira Enforcers in 2018, owned by Elmira Pioneers co-owner Robbie Nichols.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the infant son of Iyasu II and Wubit (Welete Bersabe), the daughter of an Oromo chieftain of the Yejju district.\n\nDespite his extreme youth, he was the candidate proposed by Empress Mentewab, his grandmother, who then acted as his regent. Her proposal was supported by the great nobles of the reign, \"Ras\" Wolde Leul her brother, Waragna, Ayo governor of Begemder, and \"Ras\" Mikael Sehul. One handicap with this tactic of ruling through a proxy, as Richard Pankhurst points out, was that neither Iyoas, due to his age, nor Empress Mentewab, due to her sex, could operate far from the capital city of Gondar, and relied on Waragna and her brothers to lead many of the military campaigns. The very first challenge to Iyoas' rule, when Nanna Giyorgis rebelled in Damot out of envy for Waragna's increased influence in the court, had to be suppressed by a force led by Waragna and the Empress' brother \"Grazmach\" Eshte.\n\nAnother problem grew from Mentewab's arrangement of the marriage of her son to Wubit, the daughter of an Oromo chieftain. Iyasu II gave precedence to his mother and allowed her every prerogative as a crowned co-ruler, while his wife Wubit suffered in obscurity. Wubit waited for the accession of her own son to make a bid for the power wielded for so long by Mentewab and her relatives from Qwara Province.\n\nWhen Iyoas assumed the throne upon his father's sudden death, the aristocrats of Gondar were stunned to find that he more readily spoke in the Oromo language rather than in Amharic, and favored his mother's Yejju relatives over the Qwarans of his grandmothers family, or the Gondarine nobility that had surrounded the Solomonic monarchs since the reign of Fasiledes. His preference of the Oromo only increased when Iyoas reached adulthood. He assembled a Royal Guard with 3000 of that people, and put his Oromo uncles Birale and Lubo, the brothers of Wubit, in command of them. On the death of the \"Ras\" of Amhara province, he attempted to promote his uncle Lubo governor of that province, but the outcry led his uncle Wolde Leul to convince him to change his mind.\n\nIn 1764 \"Ras\" Mikael Sehul returned to the capital city of Gondar in 1764, and convinced Iyoas to support Badi abu Shalukh, the exiled king of Sennar. Iyoas made Badi governor of Ras al-Fil along the border with Sennar, and Wolde Leul advised Badi to remain in Ras al-Fil; however the exiled king was lured back into Sennar where he was quietly executed.\n\nNot long after this, Iyoas' great uncle Wolde Leul died (March 1767), which James Bruce described was the signal for all parties to engage in a civil war. The two sides were roughly aligned around the two rival Dowager Empresses, Mentewab and Wubit (Welete Bersabe). \"Nothing had withheld them but his prudence and authority.\" The anti-Oromo party found their champion in Ya Mariam Bariaw, the son of Ayo (who had helped to make Iyoas Emperor) and governor of Begemder, and who was supported by \"Grazmach\" Eshte. The \"Grazmach\" was made governor of Damot whose governor, Waragna, had died some years before. However, the Jawa Oromo inhabiting Damot preferred to be ruled by Waragna's son Fasil; when \"Grazmach\" Eshte arrived in Damot, he was assassinated and Fasil proclaimed governor in his place; according to Bruce, Iyoas' uncles Birale and Lubo convinced him to confirm Fasil in that position.\n\nAt this point, Ya Mariam Bariaw's pride led to his losing the governorship of Begemder, replaced by the Emperor's Oromo uncle Birale. Because the governorship of Begemder included being custodian of Mount Wehni, Ya Mariam Bariaw was horrified at the prospect of a pagan outsider holding this important trust, and is said to have begged the Emperor to instead appoint any other Christian ruler to this post. (Or so a document later published by \"Ras\" Mikael Sehul, and according to Bruce, at the instigation of Aster Iyasu, the daughter of Empress Mentewab.) Despite the outcry of the non-Oromo elite, and Ya Mariam Bariaw's pledge to stop Birale at the Well of Fernay, Iyoas persisted in his decision, and sent his bodyguard to assist Birale's own followers to assume the government of Begemder. In the ensuing battle Ya Mariam Bariaw was victorious, but despite his explicit orders that Birale should either be captured or allowed to escape, his opponent was killed. Upon learning this, Ya Mariam Bariaw predicted, \"Michael, and all the army of Tigre, will march against me before autumn.\"\n\nOnce he learned of the death of his uncle Birale, Iyoas sent to \"Ras\" Mikael Sehul for help. \"Ras\" Mikael had established himself as the most powerful lord of Ethiopia, at one point having amassed some 6,000 matchlocks—six times the total number in the rest of Ethiopia. \"Ras\" Mikael first replied to the envoys that the Emperor's conduct would \"end in the ruin of his family, and the state in general.\" Then, although extolling Ya Mariam Bariaw as \"the only man in Abyssinia that knew his duty, and had courage to persevere in it\", immediately set forth for Gondar, \"his army encumbered by no baggage, not even provisions, women or tents, nor useless beasts of burden.\" He marched swiftly through Wegera, cutting a swath of destruction as he marched for the capital. However, instead of taking Gondar by storm, the \"Ras\" simply took control of the city's sources of water and every entrance into Gondar; as Bruce puts it, \"he intended to terrify, but to do no more.\" The day after his arrival, \"Ras\" Mikael visited the Emperor Iyoas, then his mother. After establishing himself as the undisputed ruler of the capital, marched on Ya Mariam Bariaw from Gondar to Begemder—only after insisting that the Emperor be the leader of this expedition, at least in name.\n\nUpon learning of this new army, Ya Mariam Bariaw, who had remained near the site of his victory, fell back into Begemder, first to Filakit Gereger, then to Nefas Mewcha \"in the farthest limits of his province\" (in Bruce's words) where the armies met. In the battle that followed Ya Mariam Bariaw was defeated, and severely wounded; he fled to the nearby province of the Wollo Oromo, who returned him to Iyoas with twelve of his principal officers. Although it appeared that the Emperor, moved by the pitiful sight of Ya Mariam Bariaw covered with blood from his open wound lying supine before him, was about to pardon this rebel, his uncle Lubo spoke up and demanded, as was his right by traditional Ethiopian law, for Maryam Bariya to delivered to him for what punishment he believed was appropriate; Lubo killed the noble himself by slitting Ya Mariam Bariaw's throat. Shocked at this at, the Emperor's own officers allowed the other twelve captives, who included Wand Bewossen, to escape.\n\nThe murder of Ya Mariam Bariaw only deepened \"Ras\" Mikael's scorn for Iyoas. Eventually Mikael Sehul deposed the Emperor Iyoas (7 May 1769); one week later, Mikael Sehul had him killed. Although the details of his death are contradictory, the result was clear: for the first time an Emperor had lost his throne in a means other than his own natural death, death in battle, or voluntary abdication. Mikael Sehul had compromised the power of the Emperor, and from this point forward it lay ever more openly in the hands of the great nobles and military commanders. As Edward Ullendorff notes,\n\nBoth the Empress Mentewab and his mother Wubit were devastated at the death of Iyoas. Empress Mentewab was distraught at the death of her grandson. She arranged for him to be buried at her retreat at Qusquam, and retired permanently to her palace there, refusing to return to the capital for the rest of her life. Although she lived through the next three reigns, she played a minimal role in them.\n\n"}

He was the son of Iyasu I, and brother of Emperors Tekle Haymanot I, Dawit III and Bakaffa.\n\nAccording to James Bruce, during the reign of his brother Bakaffa (1721-1730), the Emperor had vanished from view and a rumor circulated that Bakaffa had died. Qegnazmach Giyorgis acted on this by bringing Yohannes down from the royal prison on Wehni to rule, but before Yohannes could be proclaimed emperor, Bakaffa revealed himself and ordered the two men punished for their presumption, Giyorgis with death and Yohannes by having his hand cut off. However, in his edition of Bruce's work Alexander Murray replaced Bruce's words with a summary of the \"Royal Chronicle\", which records Yohannes had lost his hand for escaping from Wehni prior to this event, and instead, along with the other royal prisoners of Wehni, had refused to descend and be made Emperor. In either case, Yohannes did not become emperor during the 1720s or 1730s.\n\nThen, later, following the murder of Iyoas I in 1769, Ras Mikael Sehul summoned the late Emperor's great-uncle, Yohannes, from Wehni, although Yohannes must then have been in his seventies at least, and presented him to the royal council as his choice for Emperor. When one of the council pointed out that Yohannes lacked one of his hands (it had been cut off in punishment for attempting to escape from Wehni), Mikael replied that if Yohannes needed help mounting his horse, he himself would help Yohannes.\n\nMikael married Yohannes to Mikael's own young granddaughter, Waletta Selassie.\n\nYohannes' reign is succinctly recounted by E. A. Wallis Budge:\n"}

He is best known for his work in Florida, Havana and at the Panama Canal in abating the transmission of yellow fever and malaria by controlling the mosquitoes that carry these diseases. At the time, his strategy was greeted with considerable skepticism and opposition to such hygiene measures. However, the measures he put into practice as the head of the Panama Canal Zone Sanitation Commission saved thousands of lives and contributed to the success of the Canal's construction.\n\nHe was a Georgist and argued that adopting Henry George's popular 'Single Tax' would be a way to bring about sanitary living conditions, especially for the poor.\n\nBorn in Toulminville, Alabama, Gorgas was the first of six children of Josiah Gorgas and Amelia Gayle Gorgas. After studying at The University of the South and Bellevue Hospital Medical College, Dr. Gorgas was appointed to the US Army Medical Corps in June 1880.\n\nHe was assigned to three posts—Fort Clark, Fort Duncan, and Fort Brown—in Texas. While at Fort Brown (1882–84), Gorgas survived an episode of yellow fever. He met Marie Cook Doughty, whom he married in 1885. \n\nIn 1898, after the end of the Spanish–American War, Gorgas was appointed Chief Sanitary Officer in Havana, where he worked to eradicate yellow fever and malaria. Gorgas capitalized on the momentous work of another Army doctor, Major Walter Reed, who had built much of his work on the insights of Cuban doctor, Carlos Finlay, to prove the mosquito transmission of yellow fever. He won international fame battling the illness, which was then the scourge of tropical and sub-tropical climates. He worked in Florida, later in Havana, Cuba and finally, in 1904, at the site of the construction of the Panama Canal.\n\nAs chief sanitary officer on the canal project, Gorgas implemented far-reaching sanitary programs, including the draining of ponds and swamps, fumigation, use of mosquito netting, and construction of public water systems. These measures were instrumental in permitting the construction of the Panama Canal, as they significantly prevented illness due to yellow fever and malaria (which had also been shown to be transmitted by mosquitoes in 1898) among the thousands of workers involved in the building project.\n\nGorgas served as president of the American Medical Association in 1909–10. He was appointed as Surgeon General of the Army in 1914. That same year, Gorgas and George Washington Goethals were awarded the inaugural Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nGorgas retired from the Army in 1918, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 64.\n\nHe was married to Marie Cook Doughty of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obituaries:\"\n\n"}

Following the series' retirement from CBS, like many other cartoons, it was acquired by the Armed Forces Network and shown throughout much of the 1980s, mainly as entertainment for children of deployed American servicemen in Asia and Europe.\n\nThe Biskitts are a group of tiny anthropomorphic dogs who live on Biskitt Island and are committed to guarding the crown jewels of Biskitt Castle. Modeled after Robin Hood, the Biskitts still serve their recently deceased king while performing good deeds for the underprivileged inhabitants of their tiny island. It is explained in the opening narration that due to their good reputation for responsibility and security, other kings have entrusted their treasures to be safeguarded by the Biskitts.\n\nThe villain of the series is the king's mean-spirited, wasteful, younger brother King Max who rules the neighboring Lower Suburbia. In lieu of a proper coronation, Max constantly schemes to steal the royal treasure with the help of his hench-hounds Fang and Snarl and his jester Shecky. The Biskitts are also in danger of being captured and eaten by a large wildcat named Scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\nFranz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 is used in theme and in parts in some of episodes. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera used the tune in their 1946 Academy Award winning \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon \"The Cat Concerto\".\n\nA children's book was created based on \"The Biskitts\". In the book, it is discovered that King Max's jester Shecky bears a striking resemblance to King John, one of the kings who has entrusted his treasure to be safeguarded by the Biskitts. When King Max learns of this, he plots to use it to his advantage telling Shecky that they will attempt to steal King John's treasure by having Shecky impersonate King John to come and withdraw his treasure, and Max will pretend to be his slave. While Max and Shecky fool the Biskitts at first into thinking the real King John has come; Shecky seems to enjoy goofing off more and allowing Max to have to do all sorts of chores, much as King Max made him do plenty of demeaning labor.\n\nAn episode of the show, as part of the DVD collection, \"Saturday Mornings Cartoons: 1980s\", was released on May 4, 2010.\n\nOn February 20, 2018, Warner Archive released \"The Biskitts – The Complete Series\" on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection.\n\n"}

The young Jesus and the Holy Family are in Egypt. An angel has just informed Joseph that King Herod, his persecutor, is dead. In this verse the angel gives him further instructions. The wording of this verse is extremely close to that of .\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:20, 2:21.\n\nLike the rest of the infancy narrative these verses are careful to not refer to Jesus as Joseph's child. The angel refers to him as \"the young child\" not \"your young child\", but freely refers to Mary as his mother.\n\nThe main point of contention with this passage is why it refers to multiple people being dead when only Herod has died. The plural is unambiguous in the original Greek and in all surviving versions. This may link with the earlier part of the chapter where Herod colludes with the Jewish leaders to kill Jesus, but is unlikely the leaders would all have died in this brief period, and historical records demonstrates that many remained in office throughout this era. A number of explanations have been advanced to explain this problem. One proposal is that there was a secondary figure who died at the time. The most mentioned candidate being Herod's son Antipater, who died five days before the king. The problem with this theory is that there is no evidence in Matthew, or any other contemporary work, that Antipater had any involvement in the persecutions. The standard explanation is that most scholars believe the plural is due to Matthew's basing this section on Exodus. Raymond E. Brown sees this as an unlikely explanation. He argues that the author of Matthew was competent enough to change to the singular if he had so desired. Brown argues that the passage should more accurately be read as \"the plot by those who wanted to kill is dead.\"\n\nRobert H. Gundry notes that the phrase translated as \"child's life\" literally means \"child's soul.\" At the time seeking someone's soul was an expression for trying to kill someone.\n\nThe reference to \"Land of Israel\" in this verse and the next one is important. This is the only place in the New Testament where this phrase is used, i.e. the only place where \"Israel\" is used to refer to a geographic location, a usage which was common in the Book of Exodus on which this passage is based. This is the usage that is employed today by the State of Israel. The word translated as \"land\" can also be translated as state or country. Elsewhere in the New Testament the term Israel more often taken to refer to the kingdom of God or the Jewish people as a whole. Gundry notes that the author of Matthew rejects the more accurate terminology \"land of Judah\" as he was looking for a term that would encompass both Judah and Galilee, where the family would end up.\n\nVerse 21 is an almost exact copy of verse 20, except it is in the past tense. It is also very similar to . The similarity to the last verse shows that Joseph promptly and exactly obeys the instructions of the angel, obedience is an important virtue throughout Matthew.\n\n"}

He was the son of Yohannes II by \"Woizero\" Sancheviyar, at the Imperial prison of Mount Wehni.\n\nThe Scots explorer James Bruce (who was in Ethiopia from September 1769 to November 1771) described his appearance as follows:\n\nTekle Haymanot became Emperor at the age of 15 when his father Yohannes was killed by \"Ras\" Mikael Sehul, the aged warlord of Tigray. He joined \"Ras\" Mikael in defeating Fasil at the Battle of Faggeta on 9 December 1769.

A number of former rebels, who had switched sides, brought to him a number of prisoners, including the \"Aqabe sa'at\" Abba Salama; after a show trial, Ras Mikael had them brutally executed. In the days that followed, Ras Mikael wrought his vengeance on all who had opposed him; as James Bruce wrote:\n\nThe next year saw \"Ras\" Mikael Sehul defeated in the Three battles of Sarbakusa against his adversaries near Teda in May, which forced the \"Ras\" to retreat to Gondar, where he surrendered to Wand Bewossen on 4 June 1771. Wand Bewossen imprisoned \"Ras\" Mikael for a year, then sent him back to Tigray to live out his last years as governor of that province. Emperor Tekle Haymanot managed to avoid his mentor's fate at that time, and Wand Bewossen only brought him into his power when the warlord surprised him at Qaroda, capturing him while he and his men were eating. Yet Wand Bewossen's control of the Ethiopian government was short-lived; he was defeated in 1772 by the coalition of Fasil, \"Ras\" Goshu, and \"Dejazmach\" Hailu Eshte at Checheho and forced to retreat to Lasta.\n\nOver the subsequent years, Tekle Haymanot struggled against the shifting conflicts between the four paramount nobles of Ethiopia—Fasil, \"Ras\" Goshu, Hailu Eshte, and Wand Bewossen—who would form alliances against each other, only to break them and join with their former enemies whenever it was to their immediate benefit. Wand Bewossen went as far as to bring Tekle Giyorgis I down from Wehni as his candidate for emperor; Tekle Haymanot managed to defeat Wand Bewossen at Emakina and returned Tekle Giyorgis to the Imperial prison.\n\nWeary of the continuing power struggles with his nobles, and after a final conference with \"Ras\" Haile Yosadiq, Wand Bewossen and Kenfu Adam failed to gain a plausible promise of their support for his rule, he repudiated the throne 13 April 1777. Tekle Haymanot became a monk and lived as a hermit in Waldebba, where he died a few months later.\n\nDespite this political turmoil, art and scholarship flourished in Gondar. Richard Pankhurst credits the construction of seven churches built in or near that city as being built during his reign. The most important was Ba'eta Maryam, built in 1775, which originally had a large bronze cross on its roof that towered over all of Gondar; the others include: Qeddus Qirqos (dedicated to St. Cyriacus), Qeddus Petros we Pawlos (dedicated to Ss. Peter and Paul), Farta Lideta (\"the Nativity of Mary\") at Farta, Yohannes Wolde Nagwadgwad (dedicated to St. John the Evangelist), Abajale Tekle Haymanot (dedicated to St. Tekle Haymanot), and Debre Tibab (\"the Mount of Knowledge\").\n"}

He earned distinction through his combat actions in World War II and in the Israeli War of Independence. He was a founder of Democratic Movement for Change, an initially successful but short-lived centrist party.\n\nZorea was born in Chişinău, Bessarabia (then part of the Kingdom of Romania, now in Moldova) in 1923, and moved with his parents to Mandatory Palestine in 1925. He studied at the Arieli school in Haifa. He joined the Haganah at age 16, and was a member of the Special Night Squads and Notrim. After completing his studies at the Hebrew Reali School, he enlisted in the British Army was a teenager at the outbreak of World War II, but in 1942 joined the 20th company of the Buffs, which was recruited from Palestine's Jews, and after September 1944 the Jewish Brigade, a temporary combatant military element of the British military. During late winter in 1945, Zorea's Brigade took part in combat against the German army at the Senio River Valley (near Bologna, Italy). After two difficult months, the brigade emerged from the engagement battered, yet victorious. Then a second lieutenant, Zorea was awarded the British Military Cross for leading his men through intense fire, allowing spotters to pinpoint German positions. Eventually, Zorea attained the rank of captain before the brigade was dissolved in 1946.\n\nSome Haganah members among the Jewish Brigade soldiers, used The Jewish Brigade as a front for Haganah underground operations, including arms smuggling to the Haganah in the British Mandate of Palestine, directing European Jewish Holocaust survivors in emigration to Palestine (\"see Beriha\"), and executing Nazi officials and military officers. Zorea took part in all of these activities. Regarding emigration to Palestine, Zorea remarked:\n\nTo facilitate execution of Nazis, Jewish Brigade members would traverse post-war Europe in bands of three and four. Zorea explained:\n\nDozens of former Jewish Brigade members were called upon to lead the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in anticipation of the impending War of Independence. During the 1948 war, Zorea served as a battalion commander. Later, Zorea served on the General Staff as the head of the training department. He also served as Commander of the IDF Officer School.\n\nZorea retired from the army in 1953, and he was later recommissioned in 1956. He went on to positions as Deputy Commander and later Commander of Israel's tank corps, and Director of Operations. At the time, Zorea was considered a candidate for eventual appointment as Chief of General Staff, the highest position in the IDF.\n\nIn 1959, after the Night of the Ducks scandal that brought Israel to domestic and foreign crisis, Zorea was removed from his position as Director of Operations. He was reassigned as Commander of Northern Command, succeeding Yitzhak Rabin, who in turn replaced Zorea as the new Director of Operations.\n\nIn 1962, Zorea retired from the IDF as a Major-General. He participated in the Israeli capture of Adolf Eichmann, who stood trial and was later executed. Later on, during the 1967 Six-Day War, Zorea led his tank corps into the Sinai Peninsula to capture Sharm el-Sheikh from Egyptian forces. In the 1980s, Zorea was involved in the investigation of the Kav 300 affair, wherein some Israeli soldiers were suspected of killing two captured Arab terrorists.\n\nAs a civilian, Zorea was a member of the Israeli Scouts Movement and a founder of kibbutz Ma'agan Michael. He also served as a police cadet.\n\nZorea remained active in service of the State of Israel well after retirement from the military. From 1973 to 1974, Zorea served as Soldiers' Ombudsman. From 1976–1977, he served as Director of the Israel Lands Authority. While originally a member of the left-wing Mapam Party, Zorea joined with Professor Yigael Yadin in 1976 to form Democratic Movement for Change, a centrist party formed by an alliance of former members of the Alignment and Likud parties. One of the party's stated goals was to introduce a national constitution into Israeli Law.\n\nZorea was elected to the Knesset in the 1977 elections in which Dash won 15 seats (making it the third largest in the Knesset), and the party joined Menachem Begin's coalition government. While serving in the Knesset, Zorea became a member of the House Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Foreign Affairs & Defense Committee. However, the party began to disintegrate and Zorea resigned from the Knesset in 1978, less than a year after entering it. In 1984 he headed a committee of inquiry into the Bus 300 Affair. He died in 1995, at the age of 72.\n"}

She was scrapped in 1972.\n\nUSS \"Stanly\" (DD-478) was named for Rear Admiral Fabius Stanly (1815–1882). She was laid down on 15 September 1941 at the Charleston Navy Yard; launched on 2 May 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth Stanley Boss; and commissioned on 15 October 1942, Lieutenant Commander James M. Robinson in command.\n\n\"Stanly\" remained at the Charleston Navy Yard fitting-out and undergoing dock trials until 30 December. During that time, her seaplane catapult was removed to make room for additional 5-inch guns. On the 30th, she passed Fort Sumter on her way to shakedown training off the coast of Cuba. \"Stanly\" returned to Charleston on 7 January 1943 and operated on the east coast and in Guantanamo Bay until 28 February when she rounded Cape Charles and headed for Delaware Bay, where she joined \"Sante Fe\" (CL-60) and sailed with the light cruiser for Panama.\n\nThe two warships transited the Panama Canal on 5 March, fueled at Balboa the next day, and steamed for Long Beach. They stayed at San Pedro Harbor from the 12th to the 16th, when they headed for Hawaii. After entering Pearl Harbor on 22 March, \"Stanly\" operated out of that naval base until May, hunting submarines, participating in drills, and screening convoys on the last leg of their voyages to Oahu. Finally, on 14 May, she departed Pearl Harbor in the screen of a westward-bound convoy. Twelve days later, \"Stanly\" and her convoy passed through the submarine nets into the harbor at Nouméa, New Caledonia.\n\nOver the next three months, \"Stanly\" was in and out of Nouméa, escorting convoys and screening battleships and aircraft carriers. She made trips as far west as the coast of Australia and as far north and east as the New Hebrides and Wallis islands. Upon her return to Nouméa from Wallis Island on 7 August, \"Stanly\" was ordered to Espiritu Santo with a convoy. Entering Segond Channel on the 11th, she underwent 13 days availability before exiting the channel for Fila Island, also in the New Hebrides. On this passage, she was accompanied by destroyers \"Charles Ausburne\" (DD-570), \"Claxton\" (DD-571), and \"Dyson\" (DD-572). The four destroyers arrived at Fila on the 24th and stood out again the next day, bound for the Solomons.\n\nBy 27 August, \"Stanly\" and the other three destroyers were off Guadalcanal, patrolling the anchorage at Lengo Channel. The Solomons-Bismarcks area was to be her theater of operations until late February 1944. On 28 August, she stopped at Tulagi; then, steamed on to patrol the entrance to Kula Gulf, between Kolombangara and New Georgia, and returned the next day to Port Purvis on Florida Island. During the first week in September, \"Stanly\" sailed between Port Purvis and Tulagi; then, on the 8th, escorted a convoy out of Purvis Bay. The destroyer parted company with the convoy on 10 September and headed on to New Caledonia. Arriving in Nouméa on the 13th, she underwent boiler repairs, exchanged ammunition and torpedoes, fueled, and departed on 29 September.\n\nShe escorted another convoy from New Caledonia to Guadalcanal in October, leaving it off Lunga Point on the 5th. After stopping at Espiritu Santo on 8 October, \"Stanly\" returned to Post Purvis to fuel and pick up another convoy. For the rest of October, she continued to guard the convoys from Florida Island to various islands in the Solomons. On the last day of the month, she stood out of Purvis Bay and joined Task Force 39 (TF 39). During the following evening and night, \"Stanly\" fought off an attack by Japanese motor torpedo boats while the task force pounded Buka Island. The Japanese lost at least three boats during the action. Later that night, \"Stanly\" joined the rest of the task force in shelling the Shortlands, located just off the southern tip of Bougainville, in support of the landings farther north at Empress Augusta Bay.\n\nLate on 1 November, TF 39 sighted an enemy surface force, but was unable to engage it until early the next morning when it sallied forth to harass the landing area at Empress Augusta Bay. Radar contact was made at 02:30 on 2 November; and \"Stanly\", along with the other three destroyers in the van, opened the battle with a torpedo attack. Though the cruisers of Rear Admiral Aaron S. Merrill's TF 39 were the star of the ensuing battle, Capt. Arleigh Burke's \"Little Beavers\", \"Stanly\" included, contributed by finishing off the destroyer \"Hatsukaze\" and by showering a hail of 5 inch shells on the enemy. The Battle of Empress Augusta Bay claimed one enemy cruiser, \"Sendai\", and the destroyer already mentioned, but, more importantly. Admiral Sentaro Omori retired northward without accomplishing his mission, the landing of reinforcements at Cape Torokina. As dawn broke, the American warships steamed off toward a rendezvous with some transports. On the way, TF 39 beat off a 100-plane raid from Rabaul and, by the next day, was in port in Tulagi.\n\nThroughout November and December 1943, \"Stanly\" operated between the New Hebrides, the Solomons, and among the various islands of the latter group. On 16 November, she joined \"Converse\" (DD-509) in shelling a Japanese submarine and, in all probability, sank it. At various times during this period, she came under aerial attack; on Christmas Eve she bombarded Massungon Island. \"Stanly\" put in at Port Purvis on the day after Christmas for logistics and, eight days later, departed for Espiritu Santo and availability and exercises.\n\nOn 29 January 1944, she completed underway exercises and reentered Port Purvis. She stood out again the next day; patrolled around Buka Island, Choiseul Bay, Bougainville, and Green Island; and bombarded the west coast of Bougainville, the east coast of Buka, and the east coast of Bougainville, before retiring to Florida Island. \"Stanly\" entered Purvis Bay on 11 February and departed again on the 13th. She feinted toward Espiritu Santo; then, under the cover of darkness, turned north and headed for Green Island, where she supported the landings on 14 and 15 February.\n\nBy the 22nd, she was cruising the Kavieng-New Hanover area of the \"Bismarcks Barrier\". On that day, she sank a seagoing tug and helped sink the small minelayer \"Nasami\". For the next month, \"Stanly\" continued to operate with TF 39, conducting antishipping sweeps of the Kavieng-Rabaul sea lanes and bombarding various enemy positions in the Bismarcks. She also returned periodically to escort supply echelons among the several islands in the Solomons group.\n\nAs the emphasis shifted from the South Pacific to the Central Pacific in early 1944, so too, did the need for destroyers. On 24 March, \"Stanly\" exited Purvis Bay and, by the 30th, was cruising in the screen of Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force (then-called TF 58) as it launched planes against the Palau Islands. On the next day, she sailed north of Palau as Task Group 58.4 (TG 58.4) sent strikes against both Palau and Yap. The carriers' planes hit Woleai on 1 April and began retiring to Majuro. \"Stanly\" arrived in Majuro lagoon on the 6th and underwent repairs until the 30th. She spent the month of May in operations and exercises around Majuro. From 3 to 8 June, in company with \"Indianapolis\" (CA-35), the destroyer made the circuit from Majuro to Kwajalein to Eniwetok, leaving the latter atoll on the 8th to rejoin TF 58.\n\nThe Fast Carrier Task Force, with \"Stanly\" in its screen, opened the air assault on the Marianas on 11 June, sending sorties to bomb and strafe Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan. The pilots of TF 58 added Pagan Island to their itinerary on the 12th and again on the 13th. On 15 and 16 June, \"Stanly\" escorted Task Group 58.4 while its planes attacked Iwo Jima and Chi Chi Jima in the Bonins. On the 18th, the task group rejoined TF 58 just in time to witness the Battle of the Philippine Sea, in which the United States Navy broke Japanese naval airpower. On 20 June, \"Stanly\" participated in the bombardment of Guam and Rota and, two days later, moved off to defend and support the American forces on Saipan. She continued patrols and periodic bombardments around Saipan until 3 July, when she retired with TG 58.4 to Eniwetok. The destroyer returned to the Marianas on 18 July and screened the carriers until the 31st, when she was ordered back to the United States.\n\nStopping at Eniwetok from 1 to 3 August and at Pearl Harbor overnight on 10 and 11 August, \"Stanly\" entered the Bethlehem Steel Co. shipyard at San Francisco on the 17th. She spent the month of September in overhaul and early October in trials. By 18 October, she was back in Pearl Harbor preparing to return to the western Pacific. Finally, on 10 November, she stood out of Pearl Harbor and, 11 days later, entered Ulithi lagoon. \"Stanly\" remained in Ulithi for the rest of November and for the first week in December. On 8 December, she escorted \"Boulder Victory\" (AK-227) and \"SS Elmira Victory\" to Kossol Passage in the Palaus.\n\nAfter fueling, she sailed for the Philippines and arrived in Leyte Gulf on 11 December. The destroyer operated out of San Pedro Bay for the remainder of 1944.\n\n\"Stanly\", in company with \"Charles Ausburne\" (DD-570), \"Foote\" (DD-511), \"Converse\" (DD-509), and \"Sterett\" (DD-407), sortied from San Pedro Bay on 4 January 1945 and escorted the landing forces to the San Fabian and Lingayen areas of northern Luzon. Until the 27th, she patrolled the transport areas and stood radar picket duty for the assault forces while the Japanese launched the first major kamikaze onslaught of the war. By 31 January, she was back off Leyte and, four days later, entered Ulithi. On 8 February, she stood out for Saipan and arrived on the 10th. \"Stanly\" patrolled off Saipan for six days; then off Iwo Jima from 16 February until 13 March. She returned to Saipan for logistics on 15 March and weighed anchor on the 17th. She put in at Ulithi the next day and stayed until 27 March, undergoing repairs. At the completion of repairs, she headed for Okinawa, where she arrived late on the 31st.\n\nFor the first 11 days of April, \"Stanly\" moved from station to station around Okinawa on radar picket duty. On the 12th, as the \"Divine Wind\" again rose to gale force, she was on station north of the island. \"Cassin Young\" (DD-793) had just been crashed by a kamikaze, and \"Stanly\" was speeding to her station. Soon enemy planes were swarming around her like angry bees, and she maneuvered radically to avoid their deadly sting. In the meantime, \"Stanly\"'s fighter director team took charge of the stricken destroyer's combat air patrol. Under their direction, the friendly fighters whittled away at the attackers, splashing six Aichi D3A \"Val\" naval dive bombers in rapid succession.\n\nAmerican fighters and kamikazes swirled above \"Stanly\" in a grand melee. Suddenly, out of the maelstrom of planes, a rocket-powered Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka piloted flying bomb plunged toward her at a speed in excess of 500 knots (900 km/h). Her assailant's great speed made countermeasures impossible; and so, \"Stanly\" absorbed the kamikaze's impact on the starboard side of her bow, five feet above the waterline. The warhead punched clear through the hull of \"Stanly\" without detonating, passed out her port side, and exploded in the water close aboard. The remains of the pilot and some wreckage were later recovered from inside the vessel. Within minutes of the first attack, another Ohka headed for the ship, with the destroyer's antiaircraft guns blazing on it. The pilot was either wounded or killed, as at the last moment, the Ohka whisked over the ship and snatched her ensign from its gaff in passing. It skipped across the water like a flat stone, then disintegrated.\n\nSoon after the second Ohka's pass, \"Stanly\" was ordered to close the transports at Hagushi. On her way, she experienced her third near-fatal encounter of the day when a Mitsubishi Zero \"Zeke\" tried to bomb and crash into her in a single pass. \"Stanly\"'s luck held as the bomb fell short and the plane overshot. Miraculously, her total casualties for all the day's action amounted to only three wounded sailors. Late that night, she entered \"Busted Ship Bay\" at Kerama Retto for repairs.\n\nAfter 10 days at Kerama, she returned to Okinawa for an anticlimactic period of radar picket duty. She departed with an Ulithi-bound convoy on 5 May and arrived in the lagoon four days later. The destroyer underwent further repairs and exited the lagoon on the 28th for gunnery exercises. During these drills, the barrel blew off her number 5 gun, killing two coxswains. Ironically, \"Stanly\"'s only mortal casualties of the war occurred during training.\n\nThe destroyer moved on to Apra Harbor, Guam, to repair the damaged gun mount. She arrived on 3 June and remained for over two and one-half months undergoing extended availability. She was still there when hostilities ended on 15 August.\n\nOn the 20th, \"Stanly\" weighed anchor, stopped at Eniwetok and at Pearl Harbor, and entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard on the 30th. On 22 September, while still undergoing overhaul, \"Stanly\" was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet.\n\nAt the completion of overhaul, she steamed down the coast to San Diego to enter the Reserve Fleet, still in commission.\n\n\"Stanly\" was decommissioned in October 1946 and shifted her berth to Long Beach, California (USA), in January 1947. She remained in the Pacific Reserve Fleet until 1 December 1970 when her name was struck from the Navy list. Her hulk was sold in February 1972 to Chou's Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., for scrapping.\n\n\"Stanly\" earned nine battle stars for her World War II service, and the Presidential Unit Citation (US) as part of DesRon 23 the \"Little Beavers\", for its \"extraordinary heroism in action against enemy Japanese forces during the Solomon Islands Campaign, from 1 November 1943, to 23 February 1944\"—the only destroyer squadron so honored. Some live footage of her appears in the 1949 film Sands of Iwo Jima at 1hr 23min.\n\n"}

His name at birth was Wolde Giyorgis; he was the son of a noble woman who had lost her fortune and made her living by carrying jars of water, while it was rumored that he was the illegitimate son of the deceased ruler Iyasu II. The Scottish traveller James Bruce, who was living in the capital city of Gondar at the time, described him as \"a drunkard, a ruffian, and a profligate\".\n\nOn 5 June 1770, \"Ras\" Mikael Sehul was forced to evacuate the city with Emperor Tekle Haymanot; they marched to Tigray to suppress several revolts there. Goshu and Wand Bewossen entered Gondar 10 June, where they attempted to convince Empress Mentewab to join them but failed. After waiting several days for Fasil to fulfill his promise to join them from his headquarters at Bure in Gojjam, on the 27th they left Gondar.\n\nBy the beginning of August, the principal inhabitants of Gondar held a council to select a new Emperor, and \"Ras\" Sanuda's nomination of Susenyos, then 24 years old, was accepted. Ostensibly, Susenyos was to gather an army and march against \"Ras\" Mikael, but the only noble who still who could provide enough soldiers was Fasil, who continued to temporalize over marching to Gondar until 2 November, when he arrived with 400 horse and 600 foot. At his arrival Susenyos rashly granted him a third of Ethiopia, only to find that in doing so he weakened his most loyal supporter, \"Ras\" Sanuda. This led to further disagreements between the pretender and Fasil, and despite Abuna Yosab III's attempts to make a peace between them, by 26 November Fasil declared his allegiance for Emperor Tekle Haymanot and left Gondar for Dengel Ber.\n\nBruce had only one encounter with this ephemeral ruler. On the night of 5 December, in a drunken fit, Susenyos with some confederates left the Imperial palace and plundered several private homes, including the house Bruce was living in at the time. \"Every thing that could be carried away was stolen or broken; among which was a reflecting telescope, a barometer, and thermometer; a great many papers and sketches of drawings, [were] first torn then burnt\". The next day Bruce was summoned to the palace where he presented himself before Susenyos, who \nJ.M. Reid, in his biography, pointedly notes the \"sickening contrast\" between the chamber when Bruce waited on Emperor Tekle Haymanot and the presence audience. The audience with Susenyos was a trying experience for Bruce. Susenyos complained that the Scotsman had paid him no attention and demanded gifts from Bruce. Bruce reports that he made a bold reply, at which point \"an old man of noble appearance\" came forward, whom Bruce identified as \"Ras\" Sanuda, and lectured Susenyos on his behavior, reminding him Bruce \"is a friend, not only to the king but to us all: the whole people love him.\" Susenyos' only response to his advisor was to joke, \"You are very angry to-day, Baba.\"\n\nSusenyos' time on the throne was all but over 15 December, when \"Ras\" Mikael forded the Tekezé and swiftly closed on the capital; \"Ras\" Sanuda declared for Mikael Sehul. Accordingly, Susenyos fled Gondar with the Empress Mentewab; first she sought refuge with Abuna Yosab in Emfraz only to be turned away, then after sending her valuables to safety on Dek Island in Lake Tana proceeded to Qwara. Once there, writes Bruce, \"Those who made Socinios a king never made him a friend.\"\n\n\"Ras\" Mikael Sehul entered the capital city on 23 December, restored Tekle Haymanot, and began a purge of his enemies whom he found in the city, beginning with the crucifixion of Abba Salama and Germa Tseyon, the brother of Waragna.\n\nThe last glimpse history has of Susenyos is after the Three battles of Sarbakusa the following year: somehow he fell into the hands of Wand Bewossen, who before leaving Gondar with \"Ras\" Mikael Sehul as his prisoner sent the deposed pretender in chains to Emperor Tekle Haymanot; the Emperor made him a slave in the palace kitchen where, after a short time, Susenyos was caught stealing and hanged.\n\n"}

It is found in most animals.\n\nThe non-reducing disaccharide trehalose (α-D-glucopyranosyl-1,1-α-D-glucopyranoside) is one of the most important storage carbohydrates, and is produced by almost all forms of life except mammals. The disaccharide is hydrolyzed into two molecules of glucose by the enzyme trehalase. There are two types of trehalases found in \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", viz. neutral trehalase (NT) and acid trehalase (AT) classified according to their pH optima [4]. NT has an optimum pH of 7.0, while that of AT is 4.5.\n\nRecently it has been reported that more than 90% of total AT activity in S. cerevisiae is extracellular and cleaves extracellular trehalose into glucose in the periplasmic space.\n\nOne molecule of trehalose is hydrolyzed to two molecules of glucose by the enzyme trehalase. Enzymatic hydrolysis of trehalose was first observed in \"Aspergillus niger\" by Bourquelot in 1893. Fischer reported this reaction in \"S. cerevisiae\" in 1895. Since then the trehalose hydrolyzing enzyme, trehalase (α, α-trehalose-1-C-glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.28) has been reported from many other organisms including plants and animals. Though trehalose is not known to be produced by mammals, trehalase enzyme is found to be present in the kidney brush border membrane and the intestinal villi membranes. In the intestine the function of this enzyme is to hydrolyze ingested trehalose. Individuals with a defect in their intestinal trehalase have diarrhea when they eat foods with high trehalose content, such as mushrooms. Trehalose hydrolysis by trehalase enzyme is an important physiological process for various organisms, such as fungal spore germination, insect flight, and the resumption of growth in resting cells.\n\nTrehalose has been reported to be present as a storage carbohydrate in \"Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Rhizobium\" and in several actinomycetes and may be partially responsible for their resistance properties. Most of the trehalase enzymes isolated from bacteria have as optimum pH of 6.5–7.5. The trehalase enzyme of \"Mycobacterium smegmatis\" is a membrane bound protein. Periplasmic trehalase of \"Escherichia coli\" K12 is induced by growth at high osmolarity. The hydrolysis of trehalose into glucose takes place in the periplasm, and the glucose is then transported into the bacterial cell. Another cytoplasmic trehalase has also been reported from \"E. coli\". The gene, which encodes this cytoplasmic trehalase, exhibits high homology to the periplasmic trehalase.\n\nIn plant kingdom, though trehalose has been reported from several pteridophytes including \"Selaginella lepidophylla\" and \"Botrychium lunaria\"; the sugar is rare in vascular plants and reported only in ripening fruits of several members of Apiaceae and in the leaves of the desiccation-tolerant angiosperm \"Myrothamnus flabellifolius\". But, the enzyme trehalase is ubiquitous in plants. This is puzzling that trehalase is present in higher plants, though its substrate is absent. No clear role has been demonstrated for trehalase activity in plants. However, trehalose inhibits the synthesis of its precursor, trehalose 6-phosphate, a plant metabolism regulator; hence, its removal may be required. It has been suggested that trehalases could play a role in defense mechanisms or the enzyme could play a role in the degradation of trehalose derived from plant-associated microorganisms.\n\nTwo distinct trehalases have been reported from \"S. cerevisiae\". One is regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and localized to the cytosol. The second trehalase activity is found in the vacuoles. The pH optimum of cytosolic trehalse was determined to be approximately 7.0 and is thus referred to as 'neutral trehalase' (NT); whereas the vacuolar trehalase is most active at pH 4.5 and consequently termed 'acid trehalase' (AT). These enzymes are encoded by two different genes – NTH1 and ATH1 respectively.\n\nThe cytosolic trehalase enzyme, NT, has been purified and characterized extensively from \"S. cerevisiae\". In non-denaturing gels this enzyme protein exhibited a molecular mass of 160 kDa, while in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it showed a mass of 80 kDa. This hydrolase enzyme is specific for trehalose. The Km of NT has been reported to be 5.7mM. The gene responsible for trehalase activity in \"S. cerevisiae\" is NTH1. This gene is with an open reading frame of 2079 base pairs (bp), encoding a protein of 693 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of 79569 Da.\n\nNT activity is regulated by protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase activates NT. Dephosphorylation of the purified phosphorylated enzyme by alkaline phosphatase caused an almost complete inactivation of the enzyme activity; but a recovery of the enzyme activity could be observed by rephosphorylation while incubating with ATP and protein kinase. The activity of NT in crude extracts is enhanced by polycations, while the activity of purified phosphorylated NT is inhibited by them. The activation of crude extracts was found to be due to the removal of polyphosphates, both of which inhibit NT activity.\n\nThe molecular weight of AT was found to be 218 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. AT is a glycoprotein. It has 86% carbohydrate content. It has been reported that the maturation of AT is a stepwise process beginning with a carbohydrate-free 41 kDa protein; this form is then core-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum to form a 76 kDa glycol-protein. In Golgi bodies, the protein is further glycosylated yielding a 180 kDa form, which ultimately attains a maturity in vacuoles, where its molecular weight becomes around 220 kDa. The 41 kDa carbohydrate free protein moiety of the enzyme was obtained by Endoglycosidase H treatment of purified AT, resulted after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis27. AT exhibited an apparent Km for trehalose of about 4.7 mM at pH 4.5. The gene responsible for AT activity in \"S. cerevisiae\" is ATH1.\n\nAth1p, i.e. AT, has been reported to be necessary for \"S. cerevisiae\" to utilize extracellular trehalose as carbon source16. ATH1 deletion mutant of the yeast could not grow in the medium with trehalose as the carbon source.\n\nResearchers have suggested that AT moves from its site of synthesis to the periplasmic space, where it binds exogenous trehalose to internalize it and hydrolyze it in the vacuoles. Recently it has been shown that more than 90% of AT activity in \"S. cerevisiae\" is extracellular and the hydrolysis of trehalose into glucose takes place at the periplasmic space. Previously, a highly glycosylated protein, gp37, which is the product of YGP1 gene, was reported to be co-purified with AT activity. Invertase activity was also reported to be co-purified with AT activity. The physical association of AT with these two proteins was thought to suffice for the AT to be secreted by invertase and gp37 secretion pathways in absence of any known secretion signal for Ath1p.\n\nIn a \"Candida utils\" strain, one regulatory a one non-regulatory trehalase were also reported. These two enzymes were reported to be distinguishable by their molecular weight, behavior in ion-exchange chromatography and kinetic properties. The regulatory trehalase appeared to be a cytoplasmic enzyme and the nonregulatory enzyme was mostly detected in vacuoles. But, in a more recent report, a \"C. utils\" strain was demonstrated to lack any detectable AT activity but contain only NT activity. AT activity was not detectable in this strain, though the strain was shown to utilize extracellular trehalose as carbon source.\n\n"}

Many operating systems and some software automatically delete the contents of this directory at bootup or at regular intervals, leaving the directory itself intact.\n\nFor security reasons, it is best for each user to have their own temporary directory, since there has been a history of security vulnerabilities with temporary files due to programs incorrect file permissions or race conditions.\n\nA standard procedure for system administration is to reduce the amount of storage space used (typically, on a disk drive) by removing temporary files. In multi-user systems, this can potentially remove \"active\" files, disrupting users' activities. To avoid this, some space-reclaiming procedures remove only files which are inactive or \"old\" - those which have not been read or modified in several days.\n\nIn Unix, the /tmp directory will often be a separate disk partition. In systems with magnetic hard disk drives, performance (overall system IOPS) will increase if disk-head movements from regular disk I/O are separated from the access to the temporary directory. Increasingly, memory-based solutions for the temporary directory or folder are being used, such as \"RAM disks\" set up in random-access memory or the shared-memory device in Linux.\n\nA Flash-based solid-state drive is less suitable as a temporary-storage device for reading and writing due to the asymmetric read/write duration and due to wear. (See wear leveling.)\n\nIn MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, the temporary directory is set by the environment variable . Originally, the default was , then . In the Windows XP era, the temporary directory was set per-user as , although still user-relocatable. For Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 10 the temp location has moved again to within the AppData section of the User Profile, typically User Name (). In all versions of Windows, the Temp location can be accessed, for example, in Explorer, \"Run...\" boxes and in application's internal code by using . As with other environmental variables, is synonymous with the full path.\n\nIn Unix and Linux, the global temporary directories are and .

The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. In the cytoplasm, the gene product functions as a glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) that interconverts glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). Extracellularly, the encoded protein (also referred to as neuroleukin) functions as a neurotrophic factor that promotes survival of skeletal motor neurons and sensory neurons, and as a lymphokine that induces immunoglobulin secretion. The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor (AMF) based on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor. Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, and a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate neonatal death and neurological impairment. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]\n\nFunctional GPI is a 64-kDa dimer composed of two identical monomers. The two monomers interact notably through the two protrusions in a hugging embrace. The active site of each monomer is formed by a cleft between the two domains and the dimer interface.\n\nGPI monomers are made of two domains, one made of two separate segments called the large domain and the other made of the segment in between called the small domain. The two domains are each αβα sandwiches, with the small domain containing a five-strand β-sheet surrounded by α-helices while the large domain has a six-stranded β-sheet. The large domain, located at the N-terminal, and the C-terminal of each monomer also contain \"arm-like\" protrusions. Several residues in the small domain serve to bind phosphate, while other residues, particularly His, from the large and C-terminal domains are crucial to the sugar ring-opening step catalyzed by this enzyme. Since the isomerization activity occurs at the dimer interface, the dimer structure of this enzyme is critical to its catalytic function.\n\nIt is hypothesized that serine phosphorylation of this protein induces a conformational change to its secretory form.\n\nThe mechanism that GPI uses to interconvert glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate (aldose to ketose) consists of three major steps: opening the glucose ring, isomerizing glucose into fructose through an enediol intermediate, and closing the fructose ring.\n\n \n\nGlucose 6-phosphate binds to GPI in its pyranose form. The ring is opened in a \"push-pull\" mechanism by His388, which protonates the C5 oxygen, and Lys518, which deprotonates the C1 hydroxyl group. This creates an open chain aldose. Then, the substrate is rotated about the C3-C4 bond to position it for isomerization. At this point, Glu357 deprotonates C2 to create a \"cis\"-enediolate intermediate stabilized by Arg272. To complete the isomerization, Glu357 donates its proton to C1, the C2 hydroxyl group loses its proton and the open-chain ketose fructose 6-phosphate is formed. Finally, the ring is closed by rotating the substrate about the C3-C4 bond again and deprotonating the C5 hydroxyl with Lys518.\n\nThis gene belongs to the GPI family. The protein encoded by this gene is a dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible isomerization of G6P and F6P. Since the reaction is reversible, its direction is determined by G6P and F6P concentrations.\n\nglucose 6-phosphate ↔ fructose 6-phosphate\n\nThe protein has different functions inside and outside the cell. In the cytoplasm, the protein is involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, as well as the pentose phosphate pathway. Outside the cell, it functions as a neurotrophic factor for spinal and sensory neurons, called neuroleukin. The same protein is also secreted by cancer cells, where it is called autocrine motility factor and stimulates metastasis. Extracellular GPI is also known to function as a maturation factor.\n\nThough originally treated as separate proteins, cloning technology demonstrated that GPI is almost identical to the protein neuroleukin. Neuroleukin is a neurotrophic factor for spinal and sensory neurons. It is found in large amounts in muscle, brain, heart, and kidneys. Neuroleukin also acts as a lymphokine secreted by T cells stimulated by lectin. It induces immunoglobulin secretion in B cells as part of a response that activates antibody-secreting cells.\n\nCloning experiments also revealed that GPI is identical to the protein known as autocrine motility factor (AMF). AMF produced and secreted by cancer cells and stimulates cell growth and motility as a growth factor. AMF is thought to play a key role in cancer metastasis by activating the MAPK/ERK or PI3K/AKT pathways. In the PI3K/AKT pathway, AMF interacts with gp78/AMFR to regulate ER calcium release, and therefore protect against apoptosis in response to ER stress.\n\nIn some archaea and bacteria glucose-6-phosphate isomerase activity occurs via a bifunctional enzyme that also exhibits phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) activity. Though not closely related to eukaryotic GPIs, the bifunctional enzyme is similar enough that the sequence includes the cluster of threonines and serines that forms the sugar phosphate-binding site in conventional GPI. The enzyme is thought to use the same catalytic mechanisms for both glucose ring-opening and isomerization for the interconversion of G6P to F6P.\n\nA deficiency of GPI is responsible for 4% of the hemolytic anemias due to glycolytic enzyme deficiencies. Several cases of GPI deficiency have recently been identified.\n\nElevated serum GPI levels have been used as a prognostic biomarker for colorectal, breast, lung, kidney, gastrointestinal, and other cancers. As AMF, GPI is attributed with regulating cell migration during invasion and metastasis. One study showed that the external layers of breast tumor spheroids (BTS) secrete GPI, which induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis in BTS. The GPI inhibitors ERI4P and 6PG were found to block metastasis of BTS but not BTS glycolysis or fibroblast viability. In addition, GPI is secreted exclusively by tumor cells and not normal cells. For these reasons, GPI inhibitors may be a safer, more targeted approach for anti-cancer therapy. GPI also participates in a positive feedback loop with HER2, a major breast cancer therapeutic target, as GPI enhances HER2 expression and HER2 overexpression enhances GPI expression, and so on. As a result, GPI activity likely confers resistance in breast cancer cells against HER2-based therapies using Herceptin/Trastuzumab, and should be considered as an additional target when treating patients.\n\n\nGPI is known to interact with:\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees, New York Mets, and Atlanta Braves.\n\nAardsma was born in Denver, Colorado, and attended Cherry Creek High School in Colorado, graduating in 2000. He subsequently attended Pennsylvania State University in his first year of college. He transferred to Rice University in 2001, where he remained for the rest of his college tenure. Playing for the Rice Owls baseball team, Aardsma set school single-season and career records in saves in 2003. In the 2003 College World Series, he earned two wins and a save as the Owls won their first national championship.\n\nIn 2002, while playing collegiate summer baseball for the Falmouth Commodores in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), Aardsma had a 0.68 ERA and 45 strikeouts in 26.2 innings. In 2010, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.\n\nThe right-hander was drafted in the 1st round (22nd overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants. He went to the San Jose Giants (Single-A), where he posted a 1.96 ERA while striking out 28 in about 18 innings. He made the major-league roster in 2004, skipping Double-A and Triple-A, and made his debut in the season's second game. In his major league debut, in front of friends and family at Minute Maid Park, he pitched two innings, allowing three hits and walking one, to earn his first MLB win. In his first six appearances, he had a 1.80 ERA; unfortunately his success did not last as his ERA ballooned to 6.75 after 11 appearances. After giving up two runs in one inning on April 20, he was sent down to Fresno, the Giants Triple-A team, the next day. He was called up six more times throughout the season.\n\nAardsma's route through professional baseball has been somewhat unusual, given that after making the leap from Single-A to the Giants, he was demoted to Triple-A and then subsequently started the 2005 season in Double-A with the Norwich Navigators.\n\nAlong with pitcher Jerome Williams, Aardsma was traded to the Chicago Cubs for veteran pitcher LaTroy Hawkins on May 28, 2005. He spent the season in the minor leagues before returning to the big leagues with the Cubs in 2006, posting a 3-0 record and 4.08 ERA in 45 relief appearances, finishing nine games. Aardsma was especially effective against left-handed hitters, holding them to a .190 (12-for-63) batting average against.\n\nAfter a solid 2006 season with the Cubs, Aardsma, along with minor leaguer Carlos Vásquez, was sent across town to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for reliever Neal Cotts. Aardsma started the 2007 season strong. In April, he posted a 1.72 ERA while recording 23 strikeouts in only 15.2 innings pitched; he struck out at least one batter in each of his first 13 appearances of the season. On April 4, Aardsma matched a career high with five strikeouts against the Cleveland Indians. On April 11, as the White Sox visited the Oakland Athletics, he recorded his first American League win. In May, however, troubles mounted and Aardsma finished the month with a season ERA to that point of 4.73 and an ERA of 9.00 for the month.\n\nFollowing June 2, Aardsma was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte. He was recalled on June 19, but continued to struggle in his last appearances with the team.\n\nOn January 28, 2008, the Boston Red Sox acquired Aardsma from the White Sox for pitching prospects Willy Mota and Miguel Socolovich.\n\nHe pitched in 47 games for the team that year, going 4-2 with a 5.55 ERA. He also spent two games in the minors, posting a 0.00 ERA for the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox.\n\nAlphabetically, Aardsma appears first on the all-time list of Boston Red Sox players.\n\nLess than a year after joining the Red Sox, Aardsma was traded to the Seattle Mariners on January 20, 2009, for minor league pitcher Fabian Williamson. On April 10, he recorded the first save of his career, pitching 2 innings of relief against the Oakland Athletics.\n\nThe Mariners gave Aardsma a chance to close a game behind Brandon Morrow. Afterward, he became the team's official closer.\nAardsma was a projected pick for the All-Star Game, but failed to make both the starting and the reserve roster. He followed an outstanding 2009 season with an excellent 2010. Converting 31 of 35 save opportunities, he finished the year 19-for-20 in saves with a 1.80 ERA from June 13 to September 19.\n\nAfter having Tommy John surgery in July 2011, Aardsma was not offered arbitration by the Mariners and became a free agent after the season.\n\nOn February 22, 2012, Aardsma signed a contract with the New York Yankees worth one year and $500,000 with a club option for 2013. The General Manager was quoted as saying, \"The move could help us in 2012, but it has a lot more eyes toward 2013.\" Aardsma was activated from the disabled list on September 25, 2012 after Steve Pearce and Justin Thomas were designated for assignment. He pitched in just one game for the Yankees, on September 27, and allowed one run in one inning.\n\nOn October 29, the Yankees elected to exercise Aardsma's incentive-laden $500,000 club option for 2013. However, they designated him for assignment before the start of the 2013 season. When no other team claimed him off waivers, he was released.\n\nDesiring the best opportunity for playing time, Aardsma signed with the Miami Marlins, and was assigned to their Class AAA team. He opted out of his contract on May 15, 2013 after pitching in ten games for the New Orleans Zephyrs.\nOn May 20, 2013, Aardsma signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets. After pitching in eight games for the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, he was promoted to the Mets on June 8, 2013. He appeared in 43 games for the Mets with a 4.31 ERA and a 2-2 record.\n\nAardsma signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians on January 23, 2014. He was released on March 21, 2014 after not making the team in spring training.\n\nAardsma promptly signed another minor league deal, this time with the St. Louis Cardinals on March 26, 2014. He played in 35 games in the Cardinals farm system, mostly with the AAA Memphis Redbirds and was 4-1 with a 1.46 ERA and 11 saves.\n\nAardsma signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 15, 2015, and was invited to spring training. He did not make the Dodgers opening day roster, and was instead assigned to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers. In 20 games in AAA he had a 2.41 ERA and 18 saves. He opted out of his contract on June 4 and became a free agent.\n\nOn June 6, 2015, Aardsma signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. He was added to the Major League roster on June 9. He was designated for assignment on August 24. He was released on September 1.\n\nOn February 5, 2016, Aardsma signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays.

It is popularly known as California Western or Cal Western and formerly California Western University. The school was approved by the American Bar Association (ABA) in 1962 and became a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) in 1967. California Western School of Law is the oldest law school in San Diego.\n\nCalifornia Western was originally chartered in 1924 by Leland Ghent Stanford as a private graduate institution called Balboa Law College, the first law school in San Diego. His brother, Dwight Stanford, served as one of the first deans. (Leland Ghent Stanford attended Stanford, where he earned undergraduate and law degrees, and also M.A. and Ph.D degrees in Government Administration.) Balboa Law College expanded to include undergraduate and other graduate studies and changed its name to Balboa University. The law school at Balboa University was closed in 1946.\n\nIn 1952, Balboa University became affiliated with the Southern California Methodist Conference, changed its name to California Western University, and relocated to Point Loma. The law school was reopened in downtown. In 1960, the law school had six full-time faculty and 23 students. In that year, it relocated to Rohr Hall at Point Loma. It received approval from the American Bar Association in 1962.\n\nIn 1968, California Western University changed its name to United States International University (USIU). The law school retained the name California Western, while USIU moved to Scripps Ranch. Point Loma Nazarene University currently occupies the Point Loma site. In 2001, USIU merged with California School of Professional Psychology to become Alliant International University.\n\nIn 1973, the law school relocated from its Point Loma location to the current downtown campus at 350 Cedar Street. In 1975, California Western ended its affiliation with USIU and became an independent secular law school. In 1980, the new trimester system was announced, allowing two entering classes per academic year, reducing individual class size and allowing students the opportunity to graduate in two years rather than the standard three.\n\nIn 1993, the law school opened a new administrative and campus center at 225 Cedar Street, housing faculty and administration offices, including: student services, admissions, and financial aid.\n\nIn January 2000, California Western opened a new law library building at 290 Cedar Street, which was dedicated by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. The current dean, Niels B. Schaumann, joined the law school in 2012.\n\nIn December 2012, \"National Jurist\" magazine ranked California Western among the top 40 law schools in the nation for diversity. At number 35, California Western was the highest-ranking law school in San Diego for student and faculty diversity; 58 percent of entering students were women.\n\nCalifornia Western was ranked within the top ten law schools for diversity in \"U.S. News & World Report\"’s 2019 Law School Diversity Index.\n\nIn 2019, the College Gazette honored California Western by ranking it number six in its ranking of the \"Most Incredible Law Schools Outside the Ivy League.\" The College Gazette recognized CWSL's highly acclaimed STEPPS program as a client-attorney simulation course where students experience what it really takes to establish an ethical and successful practice in various fields of law. The College Gazette also recognized CWSL's Clinical Externship Program; \"In this unique program, students are afforded the opportunity to work for law firms, public offices, or other arenas. This provides exceptionally valuable real-world experience prior to actually joining the ranks of professional law.\" \n\nUSWNR ranked the school 10th for Diversity and 53rd for \"Best Law Schools, Part-time Law\";\nThe law school teaches the J.D. curriculum plus dual-degree programs, specifically:\n\nCalifornia Western also offers the Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree in Trial Advocacy with a Specialization in Federal Criminal Law as well as an M.C.L./LL.M. for foreign law students.\n\nResearch centers include:\n\nIn 2004, California Western established the STEPPS (Skills Training for Ethical and Preventive Practice and career Satisfaction) Program, one of the first skills training and professionalism courses in the nation that provides students with a simulated lawyering experience supervised by working attorneys.\n\nIts Clinical Internship Program routinely places students in the U.S. Court of Appeals, U.S. District Court, and U.S. Attorney's Offices, as well as numerous law firms in various sizes.\n\nThe law school has 25 tenured faculty members, three faculty members on the tenure track and six legal skills professors. From 2010 to 2014, 28 tenured and tenure-track faculty members published 18 books, 15 book chapters, 55 law review articles and 75 other scholarly publications. Tenure-track or tenured faculty who were members of the faculty in the last seven years wrote 70 additional publications.\n\nIn 2013, the law school joined with Bepress to create its Scholarly Commons, an institutional repository for faculty scholarship. (Bepress was created to provide open access to faculty scholarship. Its Digital Commons claims to be the leading hosted institutional repository software for educational institutions across the U.S.) The repository was created to make faculty scholarship more widely available, especially on the internet, and to preserve the faculty's scholarship, publications, documents, and records in a systematic way.\n\nThe law school created six endowed professorships to support faculty members in their research and scholarship and to recognize their leadership in legal education and the legal profession, nationally and internationally. California Western has also been named to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for the past five years.\n\nFaculty members have created programs such as the Pro Bono Honors Society, Community Law Project, and Access to Law Initiative that organize and support students and recent graduates in providing legal services to underserved segments of the San Diego community.\n\nThe California Western bar passage rate for June 2017 was 65 percent, versus 70 percent for the California statewide average of ABA-accredited schools. California Western met or surpassed the statewide bar pass rate on 14 of the last 17 state bar examinations.\n\nThe total annual cost of full-time (30-51 units) attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at California Western School of Law for the 2018-2019 academic year is $77,360 for the JD program. For the LLM Comparative Law program, total costs in 2018-2019 total $53,596. The median yearly grant for the 2016-2017 academic year was $21,500 for full-time students, with 92% of students receiving grants. 48% of students had grants covering more than half of tuition.\n\nAccording to California Western's official 2017 ABA-required disclosures, 53.8 percent of the graduating class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, J.D.-required employment nine months after graduation, excluding solo practitioners.\nAccording to \"U.S. News & World Report\", the average indebtedness of 2016 graduates who incurred law school debt was $143,592 (not including undergraduate debt), and 88% of 2016 graduates took on debt.\n\nCalifornia Western has been recognized in LendEDU's annual report on student loan default rates for having one of the lowest default rates of all of the law schools within the entire country. Specifically, the default rate at California Western was 0.70 percent according to the most recent data from the Department of Education as of December, 2019.\n\nCalifornia Western's areas of concentration provide education in the following areas:\n\n\nCalifornia Western has two major publications, the \"California Western Law Review\" and the \"California Western International Law Journal\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1936877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936877", "title": "Tekle Giyorgis I", "text": "Tekle Giyorgis I\n\nTekle Giyorgis I ( \"Plant of Saint George\"; c. 1751 – 12 December 1817) was Emperor of Ethiopia (throne name Feqr Sagad) intermittently between 20 July 1779 and June 1800, and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. He was the youngest son of Yohannes II and Woizoro Sancheviyer, and the brother of Tekle Haymanot II.\n\nAccording to Sven Rubenson, who described Tekle Giyorgis as the last emperor to exercise authority on his own, \"It is not without justification that he has in Ethiopian tradition received the nickname \"Fiṣame Mengist\", 'the end of the government'\".\n\nNathaniel Pearce, who lived in Ethiopia during the 1810s, was acquainted with Tekle Giyorgis and described the emperor, at age 66, as\n\nPearce continues his description on the next page, noting that Tekle Giyorgis\n\nThen the Englishman concludes this description with an account of the former Emperor's character, by writing, \"I shall begin by stating, in plain English, that he is a great liar and a great miser, and from his childhood has been remarkable for his changeable and deceitful temper, and utter disregard of his oath.\" Pearce illustrates this by his treatment of Wolde Gabriel, the son of Ras Mikael Sehul, who had restored him to the throne after the Rasses Ali and Meru rebelled against him: when Wolde Gabriel protested that his men were exhausted after their campaign against the rebels, and could not march forth with the Emperor to Shewa, Tekle Giyorgis conspired with his captured foes to arrest and kept Wolde Gabriel in chains, until he had ransomed himself with \"the last article of value he possessed\".. Now Prince Obed Gebru-Selassie and Prince Yodahe I are one of he remaining decentdants of Tekle Giyorgis I Emperor of Ethiopia and Gebre Mesqul Lalibela\n\nTekle Giyorgis gained and lost the Imperial throne five times after Hailu Adara and Kenfu Adam had him brought down from the royal prison at Wehni and made him emperor in 1779. According to E. A. Wallis Budge, the emperor proved unpopular from the beginning, and until he was deposed for the first time on 8 February 1784 by \"Ras\" Abeto of Gojjam, he was forced at times to seek a safe haven with \"Ras\" Wolde Selassie.\n\nHowever, the \"Royal Chronicle\" presents a very different picture, with the chronicler Alaqa Gabru stating that public opinion in Yebaba forced Kenfu Adam to elevate Tekle Giyorgis. In the first year of his reign he and Kenfu Adam had a falling out over the behavior of Kenfu's son-in-law \"Bajrond\" Tsadalu Egabet, who soon after his appointment was defeated in battle and had the signs of his office, the \"nagarit\" war drums, taken from him. Then an ally of Kenfu Adam, Gadlu, rebelled in Wolqayt and on 14 January 1780 the Emperor Tekle Giyorgis marched on Gadlu, putting the rebel's amba under siege and blocking access to the amba's water supply. Negotiations for Gadlu's surrender dragged on fitfully until 18 March when Gadlu fled with a small group of his men to Bergetta. At that point Tekle Giyorgis' was forced to disengage when he learned that Kenfu Adam had brought the former emperor, Salomon II, down from Wehni to be his candidate to replace Tekle Giyorgis. Tekle Giyorgis broke camp to face this threat, only to receive word that one of his other loyal nobles, \"Dejazmach\" Mebaras Boqatu, had defeated Kenfu Adam at Maryam Weha on 25 May, and both Kenfu Adam and Hailu Adara were now in custody.\n\nLater in 1780, Kenfu Adam escaped from his imprisonment and made his way to Gojjam; Tekle Giyrogis marched from Gondar on 4 November in pursuit. By 27 June 1781 he had reached Dangila, where he learned that Kenfu Adam had been recaptured. Although Kenfu Adam and his brother Hailu Adara could have been executed for their acts instead, out of leniency, Tekle Giyorgis had them blinded.\n\nThat November, Tekle Giyrogis undertook another campaign to Wollo, with the intent of visiting Shewa and forcing its ruler, Asfa Wossen, to submit. It was during this campaign that Tekle Giyorgis ordered the construction of Debre Metmaq Maryam church in Gondar, delegating the direct management of its building to \"Ras\" Ayadar. Richard Pankhurst notes that this church is the last example of Imperial patronage in Gondar in that century.\n\nThe emperor's first step was to secure his flank against the hostile Oromo, whom he defeated at Wuchale 14 March 1782. At the same time he had to suppress a plot against him by putting \"Dejazmach\" Wolde Gabriel in chains. But once they reached the Bashilo, his men mutinied at the prospect of crossing into Shewa, and he was forced to turn back; within three weeks, he was holding court in Aringo. The tribute from Asfa Wossen which reached him months later was small compensation for this failure.\n\nAlaqa Gabru continues Tekle Giyorgis' chronicle only until the beginning of his fifth regnal year, or mid-October 1782; from this point, the \"Royal chronicle\" is taken up with the biography of one of the warlords of the Zemene Mesafint, Hailu Eshte. The fall of Tekle Giyorgis from his throne is told tersely: \"Dejazmach\" Ali Gwangul and \"Ras\" Haile Yosadiq conspired to depose the emperor. Tekle Giyorgis marched from Gondar to Gojjam, where he expected to deal with \"Ras\" Hailu first, but the \"Ras\" managed to evade him and cross the Abay to join \"Dejazmach\" Ali. The emperor withdrew across the Abay to Afarwanat, where he was defeated in battle and forced to flee into exile at Ambasell. Why \"Dejazmach\" Ali and \"Ras\" Hailu Yosadiq decided to rid themselves of Tekle Giyorgis, and who stood with the emperor at Afarwanat is not recorded.\n\nBefore Tekle Giyorgis was restored as emperor on 24 April 1788, two rivals for the throne had appeared: Iyasu and Baeda Maryam, supported by rivals of Ras Ali. Until he lost the throne 26 July 1789, Tekle Giyorgis was one of five Emperors ruling in Ethiopia in the years of 1788 and 1789 — the others being Iyasu III, Tekle Haymanot, Hezqeyas of Ethiopia.\n\nIn January 1794, Tekle Giyorgis defeated the warlord Ras Haile Yosadiq, and once again was Emperor. He went to the province of Dembiya in the northwestern part of Begemder to seek the support of Dejazmach Gadlu, but the Dejazmach would not receive him; however, Ras Aligaz the brother of Ras Ali and who had a large army encamped at Chat Weha did receive him, and with his help Tekle Giyorgis was able to hold onto the throne until 15 April 1795.\n\nTekle Giyorgis was restored as emperor a fourth time December 1795, and remained Emperor until 20 May 1796. His fifth period as emperor was from 4 January 1798 to 20 May 1799, and his last ran from 24 March 1800 into June of that year. He lived the rest of his life in Waldebba and Tigray.\n\nDespite the fact that the imperial throne had little power or income, Tekle Giyorgis continued to work towards his restoration. Pearce recounts how the common wisdom, while he lived in Ethiopia, expected Ras Wolde Selassie to restore Tekle Giyorgis to the throne. He notes a meeting the former emperor and the ras had at Axum 17 January 1814, but the ras declined to help the former ruler. Tekle Giyorgis then left for the court of Wolde Selassie's rival, Ras Gebre, and stirred up trouble between the two until Wolde Selassie met Gebre, and was undeceived; Ras Wolde Selassie took custody of Tekle Giyorgis and afterwards exiled him to Axum, where he was kept under close watch until the Ras' death. Having fled to Axum after the death of his patron the ras, Pearce found the former king doing quite well in that city, selling noble titles to the victorious warlords in return for shares of their plunder; only Sabagadis refused to take a part in this trade. He died of natural causes at Axum, and was buried in the churchyard of Mariam Zion of that city.\n"}
{"id": "1936879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936879", "title": "Economic Espionage Act of 1996", "text": "Economic Espionage Act of 1996\n\nThe Economic Espionage Act of 1996 () was a 6 title Act of Congress dealing with a wide range of issues, including not only industrial espionage (\"e.g.\", the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act), but the insanity defense, matters regarding the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, requirements for presentence investigation reports, and the United States Sentencing Commission reports regarding encryption or scrambling technology, and other technical and minor amendments.\n\nThe act makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. Unlike the Espionage Act of 1917 (found at ), the offense involves commercial information, not classified or national defense information.\n\n\"Trade secrets\" are defined in the act consistent with generally accepted legal definitions such as those used in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and state laws based on the UTSA. Specifically it declares:\n\nThe United States Department of Justice Criminal Division has issued a prosecution policy relating to enforcement of the Act. In general, it states:\n\nThe Act can be employed to accomplish several purposes:\n\nIn \"United States v. Lange\", the EEA was used to protect a victim company that had learned that Lange, a disgruntled former employee, had been offering to sell its secret manufacturing processes to third parties. The company reported Lange to the FBI, and Lange was arrested and subsequently convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison. The case was successful in large part because the company undertook reasonable measures to keep its information secret, including:\n\n\nThe EEA has also been used to prosecute a Boeing manager, together with an employee he hired from Lockheed Martin with the offer of a higher salary in return for his inside information on Lockheed Martin's pricing. Although the EEA charges were later dropped, the matter resulted in Boeing being denied $1 billion in contracts from the United States Air Force, as well as it paying a $615 million settlement to the US Government.\n\nIn February 2010, former Boeing engineer Dongfan \"Greg\" Chung was sentenced to 16 years in prison, following the first ever trial conviction under the 1996 Economic Espionage Act. Chung, a native of China, was convicted by the US District Court for the Central District of California of stealing Boeing trade secrets related to the US Space Shuttle program and the Delta IV rocket. He spent over 30 years providing U.S. aerospace technologies to China. Chung was convicted on charges related to more than 350,000 sensitive documents that were found concealed in crawl spaces underneath his home, including conspiracy to commit economic espionage, six counts of economic espionage to benefit a foreign country, one count of acting as an agent of the People's Republic of China, and one count of making false statements to the FBI. The 15-year sentence is viewed as a life sentence for Chung who is 74 years old.\n\nChung was arrested by special agents from the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office in February 2008. He worked for Rockwell International from 1973 until its defense and space unit was acquired by Boeing in 1996, and he continued to work for Boeing as an employee and then as a contractor through 2006. Chung's arrest resulted from an investigation into the case of Chi Mak, a Chinese-American engineer convicted in 2007 of conspiring to export sensitive naval technologies to China and sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.\n\nAt Chung's sentencing, presiding judge, Cormac Carney, said that he could not \"put a price tag\" on national security, and that with the long sentence for Chung he wanted to send a signal to China to \"stop sending your spies here.\"\n\nIn April 2012, Chung's conviction was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nMost prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act have been for violation of Section 1832 (Trade Secret Theft). The first such prosecution was of Daniel and Patrick Worthing, maintenance workers at PPG Industries in Pennsylvania who stole blueprints and diskettes. Both pleaded guilty in early 1997. For another example, see the first conviction in California, that of David Brian Kern.\n\nAfter an August, 2007 plea of guilt for (one count) of violating the Economic Espionage Act and one count of violating the Arms Export Control Act, San Jose U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Fogel sentenced Canadian citizen Xiaodong Sheldon Meng, 44, to 24 months in federal prison, 3 years of parole and a $10,000 fine, with forfeiture of computer equipment seized. Meng was indicted in December 2006, with 36 counts, \"for stealing military software from a Silicon Valley defense contractor and trying to sell it to the Chinese military.\" The first to be convicted of Economic Espionage (Section 1831), Meng admitted \"illegally obtaining a program used for military training from Quantum3D and later using the program in a demonstration to the People's Liberation Army Navy after he no longer worked for the firm; he attempted to sell the fighter-pilot training software programs to the Royal Thai Air Force, the Royal Malaysian Air Force and the Navy Research Center in China.\" He paid $500,000 bond, for temporary liberty, until August 18 when he begins serving sentence.\n\nOn June 18, 2008, Meng was the first individual sentenced under the Economic Espionage statute. Meng was the first person convicted of both the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 and the Arms Export Control Act. He received a 24-month sentence and $10,000 fine, which included a sentencing departure for cooperation, according to news reports.\n\nThe International Trade Commission has used the EEA's definition of misappropriation to support its enforcement of US trade laws that prohibit \"unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation of articles ... in the United States.\" In \"Tianrui Group Company Limited LLC v International Trade Commission\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the manufacture abroad of products using a process that was developed in the United States, protected under domestic trade secret law, and misappropriated abroad, violated section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, . The ITC therefore had the authority to bar the importation of such products into the United States.\n\nThe extent to which trade secrets are covered under § 1832 was expanded in 2012, following the reversal of a conviction in April 2012 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in \"United States v. Aleynikov\" In that case, it was held that the theft of the source code for a proprietary system at Goldman Sachs was never intended to be placed in interstate or foreign commerce. As Goldman had no intention of selling or licensing its system, § 1832 (as it was written at that time) did not apply. The provision was promptly amended on December 28, 2012 with the passage of the Theft of Trade Secrets Clarification Act of 2012, so that it now applies to products or services that are used or intended for use in interstate or foreign commerce. The amendment led to a conviction in \"United States v. Agrawal\".\n\nOn January 24, 2013, § 1831 was amended to increase the maximum fines:\n\nOn May 11, 2016, in what \"Forbes\" called \"the single most important intellectual property development since Congress enacted the America Invents Act,\" the Defend Trade Secrets Act () expanded the EEA's reach. In cases filed after that date:\n\nThis legislation has created much debate within the business intelligence community regarding the legality and ethics of various forms of information gathering designed to provide business decision-makers with competitive advantages in areas such as strategy, marketing, research and development, or negotiations. Most business intelligence (also known as competitive intelligence practitioners) rely largely on the collection and analysis of open source information from which they identify events, patterns, and trends of actionable interest. However, some techniques focus on the collection of publicly available information that is in limited circulation. This may be obtained through a number of direct and indirect techniques that share common origins in the national intelligence community. The use of these techniques is often debated from legal and ethical standpoints based on this Act.\n\nOne such example is the collection and analysis of gray literature. The techniques for developing actionable intelligence from limited circulation / limited availability documents such as selected corporate publications can raise difficult legal and ethical questions under both intellectual property laws and the Economic Espionage Act.\n\nThe Society for Competitive Intelligence Professionals provides training and publications which outline a series of guidelines designed to support business intelligence professionals seeking to comply with both the legal restrictions of the EEA as well as the ethical considerations involved. In 1999, the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals published its \"Policy Analysis on Competitive Intelligence and the Economic Espionage Act\" which explained how the Economic Espionage Act will not affect legitimate competitive intelligence. The \"National Law Journal\" of March 29, 2000, reviewed the Policy Analysis and reported that the Policy Analysis' conclusion was that the EEA's \"impact on legitimate competitive intelligence would be negligible\" and that \"nearly four years\" after the EEA's passage, \"it appears that the [Policy Analysis'] predictions were on target.\"\n\nThe EEA was developed on the basis of a national philosophy that emphasizes a \"level playing field\" for all business competitors that arose in no small part due to the size and diversity of the American private sector. Many other nations not only lack such legislation, but actively support industrial espionage using both their national intelligence services as well as less formal mechanisms including bribery and corruption. The United States Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive publishes an annual report on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage mandated by the U.S. Congress which outlines these espionage activities of many foreign nations.\n\nThe United States does not engage in state-sanctioned industrial espionage. In 2000, in response to European concerns, a former U.S. Director of Central Intelligence, James Woolsy, said (in the March 17, 2000 Wall Street Journal editorial) that if there is collection, it's usually focused on bribery by European companies, not on access to technologies. Woolsey said \"most European technology just isn't worth our stealing.\" As DCI, Woolsey testified before Congress that he was reluctant to engage in economic espionage as the endeavor is \"fraught with complexities, legal difficulties (and) foreign policy difficulties.\"\n\nIn 2000, the European Parliament voted to carry out an investigation into the international surveillance project ECHELON. That same year the French government also began an official investigation into allegations that several collaborating nations may be using the program for illegal purposes. U.S. Central Intelligence Agency documents had been revealed to the British press, showing that the U.S. has been using the technology to monitor European business communications. The French and European allegations centered on the suspicion that such information was being passed to U.S. firms. The U.S. stated that monitoring was focused on the participation of European firms in supplying foreign WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programs, such as the Iran nuclear program, on evading sanctions in Iran and Libya, and on the bribery of foreign officials, such as French payments to Saudi Defense officials.\n\n\n"}

Named after James Lynah, Class of 1905, who was the director of Cornell athletics from 1935 to 1943, it is home to the Big Red men's and women's ice hockey teams.\nLynah has been home to hockey greats such as Ken Dryden, Joe Nieuwendyk, Matt Moulson, Digit Murphy, and Olympic Gold Medalists Rebecca Johnston and Brianne Jenner.\n\nThe building is a quonset shaped structure covered with multi-colored (orange, tan, black, and brown) brick wall cladding set in a common bond pattern. Projecting from the facade of the structure is a one-story rectangular wing flanked on either side by two vertical appendages, which have multi-paned colored glass windows. The one story wing has a strip of casement windows. The stairway is situated on the west side of the building. A white concrete block structure with wall buttresses connects Lynah Rink to Bartels Hall. It was constructed for $500,000 with a donation from Walter S. Carpenter, Jr. whose gift came with the stipulation that he did not want his name on the building. The facility was designed by Van Storch, Evans, and Burkavage of Waverly, PA and constructed by Streeter Associates of Elmira, NY.\n\nThe rink opened on March 21, 1957 with a match between the New York Rangers (NHL) and the Rochester Americans (AHL) in front of 4200 spectators. It was subsequently dedicated on April 6, 1957 and named the James Lynah Skating Hall.\n\nIn March, 2006 Cornell University broke ground on a major renovation project designed to add to the rink. The additions and renovations included 464 new seats, upgraded locker rooms for both the men's and women's squads and their opponents, trainers' rooms, coaches' offices and a study area for players. A new scoreboard was added as well as preferred seating and a tunnel for the players.\n\nFans of Cornell's Hockey program, aptly named the \"Lynah Faithful,\" are among the loudest and most dedicated fans in the country, making Lynah Rink, many believe, one of college hockey's most hostile arenas. The raucous crowd support gives the Big Red one of the largest home ice advantages in college hockey, losing under 20% of their games on home ice since Lynah opened in 1957. The Lynah Faithful are cheered on by one cowbell, usually played by a zealous undergraduate, but only during the second and third periods (including overtime) at approximately mid-period. Many of the other regular chants of the Faithful are listed on a website, which serves as a useful primer in the history and traditions of Cornell Hockey when initiating new students into the Lynah Faithful. After the end of all games at Lynah, when the opposing team leaves the ice, the Cornell team gathers at center ice and raises their sticks to salute the faithful as they applaud the team. This is known as the Lynah salute.\n\nCornell's men's team has had great success at Lynah Rink, closing in on its 500th win on home ice. Its record at Lynah was 15-0-1 during the 2004–05 season, 15-0-0 during the 2002–03 season, and 14-1-1 during the 2001–02 season. Postseason success at Lynah has been equally impressive. Since Lynah Rink hosted its first postseason game in 1966, Cornell's men's team has a postseason record of 38-7-2 in games played there. During the same period they were 14-1 in single elimination games with the sole loss coming against Providence in 1978 and 12-3 in multi-game series.\n\nCornell has long been criticized for its policies regarding the distribution of season tickets to men's hockey home games. Students often wait in line for nights to get tickets; however, some believe that this is part of the experience of being among Lynah Faithful. It's common to see students wearing T-shirts proudly announcing, \"I did my time in the line.\" In 2005, despite efforts to improve the process over previous years, Cornell was criticized for creating chaos when the Athletic Department announced where students had to go for tickets. In 2006, this was alleviated when the ticket line was preselected at random. During the 2009–10 Hockey season, students did not have to wait in line for season passes given growing concerns over swine flu. Instead the tickets were distributed via a lottery. Beginning in the fall of 2010, Cornell Athletics began distributing tickets via online ticket sales, giving priority to students who had previously purchased season tickets.\n\n\n"}

He rushed for a school record 4,782 yards, and 56 touchdowns. Moats was also named Offensive MVP of the DFW All-Star game, following his senior season at Bishop Lynch.\n\nIn addition to being named the Offensive MVP of the DFW All-Star game, Moats was voted MVP of the 2006 Main Mein's squad and was widely regarded as the steal of the draft.\n\nMoats then played college football at Louisiana Tech University, playing 32 games over three seasons. He was named Western Athletic Conference Offensive Player of the Year in 2004.\n\nMoats was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round (77th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. Following injury to starter Brian Westbrook, Moats was given the opportunity play in the latter half of the 2005 season. On December 11 he scored a 40-yard touchdown on his first carry of the game, his first NFL touchdown, and finished with 114 yards on 11 carries in a 26-23 loss to the New York Giants.\n\nMoats saw limited playing time during the 2006 season and missed the entire 2007 season after breaking his ankle during the Eagles' first preseason game.\n\nOn August 29, 2008, Moats was waived by the Eagles during final cuts.\n\nMoats was signed to the practice squad of the Arizona Cardinals on September 16, 2008. He was released on October 1.\n\nMoats was signed to the practice squad of the Houston Texans on October 8, 2008 when the team released practice squad Running back D. D. Terry. Moats was promoted to the active roster on October 25 after the team waived running back Darius Walker. Moats got his first carry of the 2008 season in Week 8 against the Minnesota Vikings. Moats was promoted to second on the depth chart because of an injury to Ahman Green. In week 8 of the 2009 season Moats scored three touchdowns after replacing starting running back Steve Slaton. Moats ended with 126 yards on 23 carries. He was named starting running back for the week's following game at Indianapolis. He was waived on June 10, 2010.\n\nMoats was claimed off waivers by the Minnesota Vikings on June 15, 2010. He was waived on August 24.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Moats joined the Griffins Rugby Club in Allen, TX to become one of the first NFL athletes to play the sport. The Griffins, formerly the Frisco Griffins, are a semi-pro team with strong affiliations with English Premiership Rugby.\n\nIn early March 2009, Moats's mother-in-law, Jonetta Collinsworth, died from breast cancer. When they were informed that Collinsworth was close to death, Moats, his wife Tamishia (Collinsworth's daughter) and other family members rushed to Baylor Regional Medical Center in Plano, Texas. After driving through a red light, Moats was stopped by Dallas Police Department officer Robert Powell, who delayed him for 13 minutes outside the hospital's emergency room, even after Moats's explanation was corroborated by a hospital nurse. By the time Moats reached Collinsworth, she had died.\n\nWhen asked if he felt that Powell should be fired, Moats said, \"I really don't know. All I know is what he did was wrong. I mean, he stole a moment away from me that I can never get back. I'm really not the judge on what should happen to him. I think maybe his superiors and the Dallas police should handle what should happen to him.\"\n\nThe police chief and Powell issued an apology to the Moats' family and the traffic charge was later dismissed. Police officials investigated Powell's actions; he was placed on administrative leave but later resigned from the department.\n\n"}

It is home to the five-time national champion Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey team. It is named after Harry Agganis, an outstanding football and baseball athlete for BU and the Boston Red Sox, who died at the age of 26 from a massive pulmonary embolism. A life-size bronze statue of Agganis sculpted by Armand LaMontagne stands outside the arena at the corner of Commonwealth Avenue and Harry Agganis Way. The hockey rink is named Jack Parker Rink, after the legendary BU hockey player and coach. The arena is part of Boston University's \"John Hancock Student Village\", which also includes dormitories and the university's five-story Fitness and Recreation Center.\n\nAgganis was dedicated in 2004 and hosted its first event in 2005. It replaced Walter Brown Arena, located at the Case Athletic Center, as the home of BU Men's Ice Hockey, though Walter Brown Arena is still in use as the home of BU Women's Ice Hockey. \n\nIn the arena's first decade, Boston University basketball played select home games at Agganis, with the remainder being played at Case Gym. The school made the decision before the 2015-2016 season to move all home games back to Case Gym due to poor attendance at Agganis. The last BU basketball game played at Agganis was a 77-70 loss to rival Holy Cross on Feb. 28, 2015.\n\nIt serves as a regional auditorium for large events, including concerts, ceremonies of other schools such as Berklee College of Music, musicals, awareness events, and appearances by speakers such as Barack Obama and Dave Chappelle.\n\nSince 2008, Agganis has hosted the annual CRASH-B World Indoor Rowing Championship.\n\nIt hosted the first rounds of the 2007 America East Men's Basketball Tournament and the finals in 2011. \nIt also hosted the 2009 Women's Frozen Four and has been selected to host the 2020 Women's Frozen Four as well.\nThe arena hosted TNA Wrestling's anniversary show Slammiversary on June 2, 2013.\n\nIn January 2018, the arena hosted the playoff stage for the tournament for . It was the first time in the game's history that a North American team (Cloud9) won a major-level tournament.\n\nOn Wednesday October 9, 2019, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) held the second episode of its live weekly TV program, \"Dynamite\", at the arena.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1936899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936899", "title": "Blue–green distinction in language", "text": "Blue–green distinction in language\n\nIn many languages, the colors described in English as \"blue\" and \"green\" are colexified, i.e. expressed using a single cover term. To describe this English lexical gap, linguists use the portmanteau word \"grue\", from \"green\" and \"blue\", which the philosopher Nelson Goodman coined—with a different meaning—in his 1955 \"Fact, Fiction, and Forecast\" to illustrate his \"new riddle of induction\".\n\nThe exact definition of \"blue\" and \"green\" may be complicated by the speakers not primarily distinguishing the hue, but using terms that describe other color components such as saturation and luminosity, or other properties of the object being described. For example, \"blue\" and \"green\" might be distinguished, but a single term might be used for both if the color is dark. Furthermore, green might be associated with yellow, and blue with black or gray.\n\nAccording to Brent Berlin and Paul Kay's 1969 study \"\", distinct terms for brown, purple, pink, orange and grey will not emerge in a language until the language has made a distinction between green and blue. In their account of the development of color terms the first terms to emerge are those for white/black (or light/dark), red and green/yellow.\n\nThe word for blue in the Amazigh language is \"azerwal\". In some dialects of Amazigh, like Shilha, the word \"azegzaw\" is used for both green and blue.\n\nThe color of the sky is sometimes referred to as \"the green\" in Classical Arabic poetry, in which it is \"al-khaḍrā&apos;\" (). In Arabic the word for blue is generally \"azraq\" (). The Arabic word for green is \"akhḍar\" ().\n\nIn Moroccan Arabic, the word for light blue is \"šíbi\", whereas \"zraq\" () stands for blue and \"khḍar\" () for green. The word \"zrag\" () is used to describe the color of a suffocated person, and is also used pejoratively as a synonym to \"dumb, stupid\".\n\nThe ancient Egyptian word \"wadjet\" covers the range of blue, blue-green, and green. On the one hand, it was the name of a goddess, the patroness of Lower Egypt, represented as a cobra called Wadjet, \"the green one\", or as the Eye of Horus, also called by the same name. On the other hand, \"wedjet\" was the word used for Egyptian blue in faience ceramics.\n\nIn Hebrew, the word \"\" (pronounced ) means blue, while \"\" (pronounced ) means green and has the same root, (j-r-q), as the word for vegetables (, ). However, in classical Hebrew, can mean both green and yellow, giving rise to such expressions as (pronounced ), \"leek green\", to specify green to the exclusion of yellow. Like Russian and Italian, Hebrew has a separate name for light blue (, \"t'khelet\")—the color of the sky and of fringes (\"tzitzit\") on the ritual garment \"tallit\". This color has special symbolic significance in Judaism and Jewish culture.\n\nAlbanian has two major words for \"blue\": \"kaltër\" refers to a light blue, such as that of the sky, but it is derived from Vulgar Latin \"calthinus\", itself derived from \"caltha\", a loan from Ancient Greek that meant \"marigold\" a small and in fact yellow flower. The other word, \"blu\", refers to a darker shade of blue, and like many similar words across many European languages, derives ultimately from Germanic (see also: Italian \"blu\"). There is a separate word for green, \"gjelbër\", which derives from the Latin \"galbinus\", which originally meant \"yellow\" (cf. German \"gelb\"); the original Latin word for green on the other hand, \"viridis\", is the source of the Albanian word for \"yellow\", \"verdhë\". Albanian also has a borrowed word for green, \"jeshil\", from Turkish \"yeşil\"; it tends to be used for non-natural greens (such as traffic signals) in contrast to \"gjelbër\".\n\nThere are separate words for green (\"zaļš\") and blue (\"zils\") in Latvian. Both \"zils\" and \"zaļš\" stem from the same Proto-Indo-European word for yellow (\"*ghel\"). Several other words in Latvian have been derived from these colors, namely grass is called \"zāle\" (from \"zaļš\"), while the name for iris is \"zīlīte\" (from \"zils\").\n\nThe now archaic word \"mēļš\" was used to describe both dark blue and black (probably indicating that previously \"zils\" was used only for lighter shades of blue). For instance, blueberries and blackberries are called \"mellenes\".\n\nIn Latvian black is \"melns\" (in some local dialects \"mells\").\n\nIn Lithuanian \"žalias\" is green, \"mėlynas\" is blue and \"žilas\" is grey (hair), grizzled.\n\nBulgarian, a South Slavic language, makes a clear distinction between blue (синьо, \"sinyo\"), green (зелено, \"zeleno\"), and black (черно, \"cherno\").\n\nIn the Polish language, blue (\"niebieski\" from \"niebo\" – sky) and green (\"zielony\") are treated as separate colors. The word for sky blue or azure—\"błękitny\"—might be considered either a basic color or a shade of blue by different speakers. Similarly dark blue or navy blue (\"granatowy\"—deriving from the name of pomegranate (granat), some cultivars of which are dark purplish blue in color) can be considered by some speakers as a separate basic color. Black (\"czarny\") is completely distinguished from blue. As in English, Polish distinguishes pink (\"różowy\") from red (\"czerwony\").\n\nThe word \"siwy\" means blue-gray in Polish (literally it means the color of gray hair). The word \"siny\" refers to violet-blue and is used to describe the color of bruises (\"siniaki\"), hematoma, and the blue skin discoloration that can result from moderate hypothermia.\n\nRussian does not have a single word referring to the whole range of colors denoted by the English term \"blue\". Instead, it traditionally treats light blue (голубой, \"goluboy\") as a separate color independent from plain or dark blue (синий, \"siniy\"), with all seven \"basic\" colors of the spectrum (red–orange–yellow–green–голубой / \"goluboy\" (sky blue, light azure, but \"does not equal\" cyan)–синий / \"siniy\" (\"true\" deep blue, like synthetic ultramarine)–violet) while in English the light blues like azure and cyan are considered mere shades of \"blue\" and not different colors. The Russian word for \"green\" is зелёный, \"zielioniy\". To better understand this, consider that English makes a similar distinction between \"red\" and light red (pink, which is considered a different color and not merely a kind of red), but such a distinction is unknown in several other languages; for example, both \"red\" ( / , \"hóng\") and \"pink\" (, \"fěn hóng\", lit. \"powder red\") have traditionally been considered varieties of a single color in Chinese. The Russian language also distinguishes between red (красный, krasniy) and pink (розовый, rozoviy).\n\nSimilarly English descriptions of rainbows have often distinguished between blue or turquoise and indigo, the latter of which is often described as dark blue or ultramarine.\n\nThe Serbo-Croatian color system makes a distinction between blue, green and black:\n\n\n\"Modra\" may also mean dark purple and is used to describe a bruise, \"modrica\". Native speakers cannot pinpoint a color on the spectrum which would correspond to \"modra\".\n\n\"Sinje\", cognate to Bulgarian синьо, \"sinyo\"/Russian синий, \"siniy\", is archaic, and denotes blue-gray, usually used to describe dark skies or seas.\n\n\"Mrka\" \"dusky\" can refer either to dark grey or dark brown, or even black. It is etymologically derived from the word for \"darkness\" (\"mrak\"), but it is distinct from \"dark\" (\"taman\"). For instance, it is used to describe the brown bear (\"mrki medvjed\").\n\nTurquoise is usually described as \"tirkizna\", and similarly, azure will use a loan word \"azurna\". There is no specific word for cyan. Blond hair is called \"plava\" ('blue'), reflecting likely the archaic use of \"plav\" for any bright white/blue colors (like the sky).\n\nShades are defined with a prefix (e.g. \"tamno-\" for dark, or \"svjetlo-\" for light), for example, dark blue = \"tamnoplava\".\n\nThe Slovene language distinguishes among blue, green and black\n\n\nAlthough the blue and green color are not strictly defined, so Slovene speakers cannot point to a certain shade of blue or green, but rather the whole spectrum of blue and green shades, there is a distinction between light and dark hues of these colors, which is described with prefixes \"svetlo- (light)\" and \"temno- (dark)\".\n\nTransient hues between blue and green are mostly described as \"zeleno modra\" or \"modro zelena\", sometimes as \"turkizna\" (turquoise). Transient hues between green and yellow (\"rumena\") are described as \"rumeno zelena\" or \"zeleno rumena.\"\n\nThe Welsh word \"glas\" is usually translated as \"blue\"; however, it can also refer, variously, to the color of the sea, of grass, or of silver (cf. Greek γλαυκός). The word \"gwyrdd\" (a borrowing from Latin \"viridis\") is the standard translation for \"green\". In traditional Welsh (and related languages), \"glas\" could refer to certain shades of green and grey as well as blue, and \"llwyd\" could refer to various shades of grey and brown. Perhaps under the influence of English, modern Welsh is tending toward the 11-color Western scheme, restricting \"glas\" to blue and using \"gwyrdd\" for green, \"llwyd\" for grey and \"brown\" for brown. However, the more traditional usage is still heard today in the Welsh for grass (\"glaswellt\" or \"gwelltglas\") and in fossilized expressions such as \"caseg las\" (grey mare), \"tir glas\" (green land), \"papur llwyd\" (brown paper) and even red for brown in \"siwgwr coch\" (brown sugar).\n\nIn Modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic the word for \"blue\" is \"gorm\" (whence the name Cairngorm mountains derives) – a borrowing of the now obsolete Early Welsh word \"gwrm\", meaning \"dark blue\" or \"dusky\". A relic of the original meaning (\"dusky\", \"dark brown\") survives in the Irish term \"daoine gorma\", meaning \"Black people\".\nIn Old and Middle Irish, like in Welsh, \"glas\" was a blanket term for colors ranging from green to blue to various shades of grey (e.g. the \"glas\" of a sword, the \"glas\" of stone, etc.). In Modern Irish, it has come to mean various shades of green, with specific reference to plant hues, and grey (like the sea); other shades of green would be referred to in Modern Irish as \"uaine\" or \"uaithne\", while \"liath\" is grey proper (like a stone).\n\nScottish Gaelic uses the term \"uaine\" for \"green\". However, the dividing line between it and \"gorm\" is somewhat different than between the English \"green\" and \"blue\", with \"uaine\" signifying a light green or yellow-green, and \"gorm\" extending from dark blue (what in English might be navy blue) to include the dark green or blue-green of vegetation. Grass, for instance, is \"gorm\", rather than \"uaine\". In addition, \"liath\" covers a range from light blue to light grey. However, the term for a green apple, such as a Granny Smith, would be \"ubhal glas\".\n\nThe boundary between colors varies much more than the \"focal point\": e.g. an island known in Breton as \"Enez c'hlas (\"the blue island\")\" is called in French \"l'Île Verte (\"the green island\")\", in both cases referring to the greyish-green color of its bushes, even though both languages distinguish green (as in lawn grass) from blue (as in a cloudless midday sky).\n\nThe Romance terms for \"green\" (Catalan ', French ', Italian, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish ') are all from Latin '. The terms for \"blue\", on the other hand, vary: Catalan ', Occitan ', French ' and Italian ' come from a Germanic root, whereas the Spanish and Portuguese \"azul\" is likely to come from Arabic. French \"bleu\" was in turn loaned into many other languages, including English. Latin itself did not have a word covering all shades of blue, which may help explain these borrowings. It did, however, recognise ' (dark blue, sometimes greenish), and ' (greyish blue, like lead).\n\nFrench, as most Romance languages, makes roughly the same distinctions as English and has a specific term for each of blue (\"\"), green (\"\") and grey (\"\"). For all three, different shades can be indicated with different (compound) terms, none of them being considered as basic color terms: \"bleu \" (light blue), \"bleu \" (sky blue), \"bleu \" (Navy blue), \"bleu \" (royal blue); \"vert clair\" (light green), \"vert \" (literally: apple green); \"gris \" (very dark grey), \"gris \" (literally: mouse grey). French also uses \"\" for the lighter shade of blue of the sunny sky, that was in turn loaned to English as \"azure\".\n\nCatalan distinguishes blue (') from green (') and grey ('). Other basic or common colors by its own right are ' \"purple\", ' \"yellow\", ' \"orange\", ' \"red\", ' \"pink\", ' \"brown\", ' \"grey\", ' \"black\" and ' \"white\". For all these colors except black and white it is possible to indicate different shades using ' \"light\" and ' \"dark\"; for blue, though, it generally is \"blau cel\" \"sky blue\" and \"blau marí\" \"sea blue\". Other words and compounds are common to indicate more elaborated shades (\"verd llimona\" \"lemon green\", \"rosa pàlid\" \"pale pink\", \"lila\" \"lilac\", \"granat\" \"carmine\", \"ocre\" \"ochre\", \"verd oliva\" \"olive green\", etc.). Catalan actually distinguishes two reds with different and common words: while ' refers to the color of arterial blood, ' is a red tending towards yellow or the color of clay.\n\nItalian distinguishes blue ('), green (') and grey ('). There are also common words for light blue (e.g. the color of the cloudless sky): ' and ', and other for darker shades, e.g. ', indigo. ', the equivalent of the English azure, is usually considered a separate basic color rather than a shade of \"blu\" (similar to the distinction in English between red and pink). Some sources even go to the point of defining \"blu\" as a darker shade of \"azzurro\". \"Celeste\" literally means '(the color) of the sky' and can be used as synonym of \"azzurro\", although it will more often be considered a less saturated hue. ' (aquamarine) literally \"sea water\", indicates an even lighter, almost transparent, shade of blue. To indicate a mix of green and blue, Italians might say \"verde \", literally \"water green\". The term ', not common in standard Italian and perceived as a literary term, is used in scientific contexts (esp. botany) to indicate a mix of blue, green and gray. Other similar terms are ' and \"\" (turquoise/teal); they are more saturated hues (especially turchese) and differ in context of use: the first is a literary or bureaucratic term (used for example to indicate light green eyes in identity cards); the second is more common in any informal speech, along with the variant \"turchino\" (for instance, the fairy of The Adventures of Pinocchio is called \"fata turchina\").\n\nIn Portuguese, the word \"\" means blue and the word \"\" means green. Furthermore, \"azul-\" means light-blue, and \"azul-\" means dark-blue. More distinctions can be made between several hues of blue. For instance, \"azul-\" means sky blue, \"azul-\" means navy-blue and \"azul-\" means turquoise-blue. One can also make the distinction between \"verde-claro\" and \"verde-escuro\", meaning light and dark-green respectively, and more distinctions between several qualities of green: for instance, \"verde-\" means olive-green and \"verde-\" means emerald-green. Cyan is usually called \"azul-celeste\" (sky blue) or \"azul-\", meaning pool blue, but also less commonly \"\", and \"verde-\", meaning water green.\n\nRomanian clearly distinguishes between the colors green (') and blue ('). It also uses separate words for different hues of the same color, e.g. light blue ('), blue (\"albastru\"), dark-blue (\"bleu-\" or '), along with a word for turquoise (') and azure (' or \").\n\nSimilarly to French, Romanian, Italian and Portuguese, Spanish distinguishes blue (') and green (') and has an additional term for the tone of blue visible in the sky, namely \"\", which is nonetheless considered a shade of blue.\n\nIn Old Norse, the word ' \"blue\" (from proto-Germanic ) was also used to describe black (and the common word for people of African descent was thus ' 'blue/black men'). In Swedish, \", the modern word for blue, was used this way until the early 20th century, and it still is to a limited extent in modern Faroese.\n\nGerman and Dutch distinguish blue (respectively ' and ') and green (' and ') very similarly to English. There are (compound) terms for light blue (' and ') and darker shades of blue (' and '). In addition, adjective forms of most traditional color names are inflected to match the corresponding noun's case and gender.\n\nThe words for “blue” and “green” completely changed in the transition from Ancient Greek to Modern Greek.\n\nAncient Greek had γλαυκός (\"glaukós\") “clear light blue” contrasting with χλωρός (\"khlōrós\") “bright green”; for darker shades of both colors, γλαυκός and χλωρός were replaced by κυανός (\"kuanós\"), meaning either a “dark blue or green”. The words had more than one modern meaning: in addition to “clear light blue”, γλαυκός also meant “turquoise” and “teal-green” – it was the typical description of the color of the goddess Athena’s eyes, portrayed as grey or light blue. As well as “bright green”, χλωρός was also used for “acid yellow” (compare “chlorophyll”). And κυανός (\"kuanós\") not only meant “turquoise” and “teal-green”, but also either a “dark blue” or “dark green” or just “blue” (adopted into English as “cyan” for light sky-blue).\n\nThose terms changed in Byzantine Era Greek as seen from the insignia colors of two of Constantinople’s rival popular factions: Πράσινοι (\"Prasinoi\", “the Greens”) and Bένετοι (\"Venetoi\", “the Blues”). It is not known if those groups’ names influenced the word change or if they were named using the new color terms, but whichever way it went, πράσινος (\"prásinos\") is a Modern Greek word for “green”.\n\nThe ancient term for blue (γλαυκός) has disappeared from Modern Greek as such, replaced by γαλάζιος (\"galázios\") or θαλασσής (\"thalassís\", “sea colored”) for light blue / sea blue, and the recent indeclinable loan-word μπλε (\"ble\", from French \"bleu\"; μπ = \"b\") is used for blue.\n\nIn the Modern Greek language, there are names for light and dark blues and greens in \"addition\" to those discussed above:\nAs a rule, the first two words of the list are accepted as shades of blue, and the rest as shades of green. Also βιολέ (\"violé\") / βιολετής (\"violetís\") for violet blue (which is, however, usually considered as a shade of purple, rather than blue).\n\nOssetian has one word for blue, light blue and green—цъæх (tsəh), which also means \"grey\" and \"glaucous\"—but it also has a separate word for green, кæрдæгхуыз (kərdəghuɨz), literally \"grassy\" (from кæрдæг \"grass\"). The latter derives from кæрдын (kərdɨn) \"to mow\" (like in German \"Heu\" (\"hau\") < \"hauen\" (to mow)).\n\nOssetian also has separate words for these colors:\n\nPashto uses the word \"shīn\" to denote blue as well as green. \"Shinkay\", a word derived from \"shīn\", means 'greenery' but \"shīn āsmān\" means 'blue sky'. When there is ambiguity, it is common to ask (as in Vietnamese), \"\"Shīn\" like the sky? Or \"shīn\" like plants?\"\n\nPersian words for blue include \"ābi\" (literally the color of water, from \"āb\" 'water'), for blue generally; \"nili\" (from \"nil\", 'indigo dye'), for deeper shades of blue such as the color of rain clouds; \"fayruzeh\" 'turquoise stone', used to describe the color of blue eyes; \"lājvardi\" or \"lāzhvardi\" 'lapis lazuli color', source of the words \"lazuli\" and \"azure\"; \"nilufari\" 'water lily color'; and \"kabud\", an old literary word for 'blue'.\n\nThe Persian word for green is \"sabz\". As in Sudan, dark-skinned people may be described as \"green\".\n\nThe color of the sky is variously described in Persian poetry using the words \"sabz\", \"fayruzeh\", \"nil\", \"lājvardi\", or \"nilufari\"— literally \"green\", \"indigo\", \"turquoise\", \"azure\" or \"the color of water lilies\". For example, \"sabz-ākhor\" \"green stable\", \"sabz-āshyāneh\" \"green ceiling\", \"sabz-ayvān\" \"green balcony\", \"sabz-bādbān\" \"green sail\", \"sabz-bāgh\" \"green garden\", \"sabz-farsh\" \"green carpet\", \"sabz-golshan\" \"green flower-garden\", \"sabz-kārgāh\" \"green workshop\", \"sabz-kh\"\"ān\" \"green table\", \"sabz-manzareh\" \"green panorama\", \"sabz-maydān\" \"green field\" \"sabz-pol\" \"green bridge\", \"sabz-tāq\" \"green arch\", \"sabz-tasht\" \"green bowl\", and \"sabz-tā'us\" \"green peacock\" are poetic epithets for the sky—in addition to similar compounds using the words for blue, e.g. \"lājvardi-saqf\" \"lapis lazuli-colored roof\" or \"fayruzeh-tasht\" \"turquoise bowl\". Moreover, the words for green of Arabic origin \"akhzar\" and \"khazrā\" are used for epithets of the sky or heaven, such as \"charkh-e akhzar\" \"green wheel\".\n\nIndo-Aryan languages distinguish blue from green. In Urdu, blue is نیلا (\"nīlā\") and green is سبز (\"sabz\"). There are some names of shades of blue as well, like فیروزی (\"ferozī\") \"turquoise\".\nIn Hindi, blue is नीला (\"nīlā\") and green is हरा (\"harā\").\nIn Marathi, blue is निळा (\"niḽā\") and green is हिरवा (\"hiravā\").\n\nIn the Basque language there are three native color words derived from \"ur\" (water). \"Urdin\", is nowadays used in most cases for blue. \"Ubel\", originally meant flash flood and, with respect to colors, is often used in relation to bruises. \"Begi ubela\" would be translated into English by \"a black and blue eye\". But in Basque, unlike English, ubel remains in use after the hit skin has lost its purple color and become pale, why this word is used for both purple in particular and pale hue in general. \"Uher\", originally meant dirty, still water or rusty and is used for gray or sienna tones or impure, dark color in general. Green is usually expressed with the loan-word \"berde\" from Spanish \"verde\"/ French \"vert\". The authenticity of the less common Basque terms for green \"(h)orlegi\" and \"musker\" is disputed.\n\nFinnish makes a distinction between \"vihreä\" (green) and \"sininen\" (blue). Turquoise or teal (\"turkoosi\" or \"sinivihreä\") is considered to be a separate, intermediate color between green and blue, and black (\"musta\") is also differentiated from blue.\n\nThe name for blue, \"sininen\", is shared with other Finnic languages and is thus dated to the era of the Proto-Finnic language (ca. 2000 years old). However, it is also shared with the Slavic languages (Russian синий, \"siniy\"), suggesting that it could be a loanword (most probable from Indo-Iranian Scythian language; see Proto-Finnic *sini, Proto-Slavic *siňь). The word \"vihreä\" (\"viher-\", archaic \"viheriä\", \"viheriäinen\") is related to \"vehreä\" \"verdant\" and \"vihanta\" \"green\", and \"viha\" \"hate\", originally \"poison\". It is not shared with Estonian, in which it is \"roheline\", probably related with the Estonian word \"rohi\" \"grass\". However, the form \"viha\" does have correspondences in related languages as far as Permic languages, where it means not only \"poison\" but \"bile\" or \"green or yellow\". It has been originally loaned from an Indo-Iranian protolanguage and is related to Latin \"virus\" \"poison\". Furthermore, the word \"musta\" \"black\" is also of Finnic origin.\n\nThe differentiation of several colors by hue is at least Finnic (a major subgroup of Uralic) in origin. Before this, only red (\"punainen\") was clearly distinguished by hue, with other colors described in terms of brightness (\"valkea\" vs. \"musta\"), using non-color adjectives for further specificity. Alternatively, it appears that the distinction between \"valkea\" and \"musta\" was in fact \"clean, shining\" vs. \"dirty, murky\". The original meaning of \"sini\" was possibly either \"black/dark\" or \"green\". Mauno Koski's theory is that dark colors of high saturation—both blue and green—would be \"sini\", while shades of color with low saturation, such as dark brown or black, would be \"musta\". Although it is theorized that originally \"vihreä\" was not a true color name and was used to describe plants only, the occurrence of \"vihreä\" or \"viha\" as a name of a color in several related languages shows that it was probably polysemic (meaning both \"green\" and \"verdant\") already in early Baltic-Finnic. However, whatever the case with these theories, differentiation of blue and green must be at least as old as the Baltic-Finnic languages.\n\nHungarian makes the distinction between green (\"zöld\") and blue (\"kék\"), and also distinguishes black (\"fekete\"). Intermediate colors between green and blue are commonly referred to as \"zöldeskék\" (literally greenish-blue) or \"kékeszöld\" (bluish-green), but names for specific colors in this continuum—like turquoise (\"türkiz\")—also exist. Particular shades of a color can also have separate names, such as azure (\"azúr\").\n\nThe Kazakh language, like many Turkic languages, distinguishes between \"kök\" for blue and \"jasâl\" for green. In Kazakh, many adjectival variations can be found referring to perceived gradations in saturation level of \"blue\", such as \"kögildir\", \"kökshil\", and \"kökboz\", which respectively denominate the gradual decrease in the intensity, \"kökboz\" being often used as a color referent in its own right. \"Kök\" is occasionally used to denote green plants (e.g. 'kök' shöp'), but such usage is mostly confined to poetic utterances or certain localized dialects.\n\nTurkish treats dark or navy blue (\"lacivert\", from the same Persian root as English \"azure\" and \"lapis lazuli\") as a separate color from plain or light blue (\"mavi\"). \"Mavi\" is derived from the Arabic word مائي \"mā'ī\" 'like water' (ماء \"mā\"' being the Arabic word for water) and \"lacivert\" is derived from Persian لاجورد \"lājvard\" 'lapis lazuli', a semiprecious stone with the color of navy blue. In the pre-Islamic religion of the Turks, blue is the color that represented the east, as well as the zodiac sign Aquarius (the Water Bearer). A characteristic tone of blue, turquoise, was much used by the Turks for their traditional decorations and jewelry.\n\nIn traditional pre-Islamic Turkic culture, both blue and green were represented by the same name, \"gök\" 'sky'. The name is still in use in many rural areas. For instance, in many regions of Turkey, when mold is formed on cheese, the phenomenon is called \"gögermek\" 'turning into the color of \"gök\"/sky'.\n\nThe Tamil language clearly distinguishes between the colors green (\"paccai\"), blue (\"neelam\") and black (\"karuppu\"). The prefix \"karu-\" would indicate dark colors while the suffix \"iḷam\" would indicate light colors. Thus \"karumpaccai\" would be dark green. \n\nThe Telugu language uses a single word, \"pacca\", for green and yellow. To differentiate between the two shades, another word is prefixed in some cases. For example, green will be called \"ākupacca\" \"leaf-\"pacca\"\" and yellow \"pasupupacca\" \"turmeric-\"pacca\"\".\n\nThe Kannada language distinguishes between blue (\"neeli\" - ನೀಲಿ), green (\"hasiru\" - ಹಸಿರು) and yellow (\"haladi\" - ಹಳದಿ). The prefix \"kadu\" (ಕಡು) would indicate darker colors while the prefix \"tili\" (ತಿಳಿ) would indicate light colors. Thus \"kaduneeli\" (ಕಡುನೀಲಿ) would mean dark/deep blue, while \"tilineeli\" (ತಿಳಿನೀಲಿ) would mean light blue.\n\nIn Malayalam there are distinct words for blue (neela - നീല), green (pachcha - പച്ച) and yellow (manja - മഞ്ഞ). \n\nThe modern Chinese language has the blue–green distinction (蓝/ 藍 \"lán\" for blue and 绿 / 綠 \"lǜ\" for green); however, another word that predates the modern vernacular, \"qīng\" (), is also used. The character depicts the budding of a young plant and it could be understood as \"verdant\", but the word is used to describe colors ranging from light and yellowish green through deep blue all the way to black, as in \"xuánqīng\" (). For example, the flag of the previous Republic of China was referred to as \"qīng tiān, bái rì, mǎn dì hóng\" (\"'Blue' Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\"—); whereas \"qīngcài\" () is the Chinese word for \"green bok choy\". A cucumber is known as either \"huángguā\" () \"yellow melon\" or \"qīngguā\" () \"green melon\", which is more commonly used in Cantonese. \"Qīng\" 青, was the traditional designation of both blue and green for much of the history of the Chinese language, while 藍 \"lán\" ('blue') originally referred to the indigo plant. However, the character 綠 \"lǜ\" ('green'), as a particular 'shade' of \"qīng\" applied to cloth and clothing, has been attested since the \"Book of Odes\" (1000 to 600 B.C.) (e.g., the title of Ode 27 《邶風·綠衣》 'Green Upper Garment' in the \"Airs of Bei\"). As a part of the adoption of modern Vernacular Chinese as the social norm, replacing Classical Chinese, the modern terms for blue and green are now more commonly used than \"qīng\" as standalone color terms, although \"qīng\" is still part of many common noun phrases. The two forms can also be encountered combined as 青藍 and 青綠, with 青 being used as an intensifier.\n\nThe Japanese word , the same kanji character as the Chinese \"qīng\", can refer to either blue or green depending on the situation. Modern Japanese has a word for , but it is a relatively recent usage. Ancient Japanese did not have this distinction: the word \"midori\" only came into use in the Heian period, and at that time (and for a long time thereafter) \"midori\" was still considered a shade of \"ao\". Educational materials distinguishing green and blue only came into use after World War II; thus, even though most Japanese consider them to be green, the word \"ao\" is still used to describe certain vegetables, apples, and vegetation. \"Ao\" is also the word used to refer to the color on a traffic light that signals one to \"go\". However, most other objects—a green car, a green sweater, and so forth—will generally be called \"midori\". Japanese people also sometimes use the word , based on the English word \"green\", for colors. The language also has several other words meaning specific shades of green and blue.\n\nThe native Korean words (Revised Romanization: \"pureu-da\") may mean either blue or green, or bluish green. These adjectives are used for blue as in (\"pureu-n haneul\") or 파란 하늘 (para-n haneul) meaning 'blue sky', or for green as in (\"pureu-n sup\", green forest). 푸른 (pur-n) is a noun-modifying form. There are Sino-Korean expressions that refer to green and blue. (\"chorok\" adj./n.), (\"choroksaek\" n. or for short, \"noksaek\" n.) is used for green. \"Cheong\" , another expression borrowed from Chinese (pinyin: \"qing\"), is mostly used for blue, as in 청바지/靑-- (cheong-baji, blue jean\" and Cheong Wa Dae ( or Hanja: ), the Blue House, which is the executive office and official residence of the President of the Republic of Korea, but is also used for green as well, as in 청과물/靑果物 (cheong-gwamul, fruits and vegetables) and 청포도/靑葡萄 (cheong-podo, green grape).\n\nIn Tibetan, སྔོན་པོ། (Wylie sngon po) is the term traditionally given for the color of the sky and of grass. This term also falls into the general pattern of naming colors by appending the suffix \"po\", as in \"mar po\" (red); \"ser po\" (yellow); \"nag po\" (black); and \"dkar po\" (white). Conspicuously, the term for \"green\" is \"ljang khu\", likely related to \"ljang bu\", and defined as—\"the grue (sngon po) sprout of wheat or barley\".\n\nVietnamese usually does not use separate words for green and refers to that color using a word that can also refer to blue. In Vietnamese, blue and green are denoted by \"xanh\" (青). This is a colloquial rendering of \"thanh\" (青), as with Chinese and Japanese. Blue is specifically described as \"xanh da trời\", as in the light blue skin of the sky, or \"xanh dương, xanh nước biển\", as in the deep blue of the ocean. Green is described as \"xanh lá cây,\" as in the color of leaves.\n\nVietnamese occasionally does employ the terms \"xanh lam\" and \"xanh lục\" (in which the second syllables derive from the Chinese: 藍 and 綠) for \"blue\" and \"green\", respectively. However, these notions are rarely used in spoken language and more so in old written documents as there is now a movement towards pure Vietnamese words, or \"từ Thuần Việt\", and away from Chinese-influenced Vietnamese words.\n\nIn Mongolian, the word for green is ногоон (\"nogoon\"). Mongolian distinguishes between dark and light blue. The word for light blue is цэнхэр (\"tsenher\") and the word for dark blue is хөх (\"höh\").\n\nSpeakers of Tagalog most commonly use the Spanish loanwords for blue and green—\"asul\" (from Spanish \"azul\") and \"berde\" (from Spanish \"verde\"), respectively. Although these words are much more common in spoken use, Tagalog has native terms: \"bugháw\" for blue and \"lunti(án)\" for green, which are seen as archaic and more flowery. These are mostly confined to formal and academic writings, alongside artistic fields such literature, music, and poetry.\n\nIn Cebuano, another major Philippine language, the native words for \"blue\" and \"green\" end in the same syllable: \"pughaw\" and \"lunhaw\", respectively. Pughaw means sky blue, while lunhaw is fresh leaf green (i.e. neither brownish nor yellowish).\n\nHumour and jokes of a sexual or derogatory nature are called \"green\" in Philippine English while they would otherwise be described as \"blue\" in English (e.g. \"blue comedy\", \"blue joke\"). This is a calque of the Hispanic term \"chiste verde\".\n\nModern Javanese has distinct words for blue \"biru\" and green \"ijo\". These words are derived from Old Javanese \"birū\" and \"hijo\". However, in Old Javanese \"birū\" could mean pale blue, greyish blue, greenish blue or even turquoise, while \"hijo\" which means green, could also means the blue-green colour of clear water. \"Biru\" and \"ijo\" in Modern Javanese are cognates of Malay/Indonesian \"biru\" and \"hijau\" which have the same meaning.\n\nThe Yoruba word for green is \"àwö ewéko\", which translates to \"color of leaves\", and blue is \"àwö sánmà\", which translates to \"color of sky\".\n\nThe Swahili word for blue is \"buluu\", which is derived directly from English and has been in the language for a relatively short time. For other colors, Swahili uses either \"rangi ya ___\" (\"the color of ___\") or a shortened version, \"-a ___\". For example, green is \"rangi ya kijani\" or \"rangi ya majani\", which means \"the color of grass/leaves\". Sky blue is \"rangi ya samawati\", or \"the color of the sky\" from the Arabic word for sky. (Note: all of these can be written as \"-a kijani\", \"-a majani\", \"-a samwati\", etc.)\n\nZulu and Xhosa use the word \"-luhlaza\" (the prefix changes according to the class of the noun) for \"blue/green\".\n\nTswana uses the same word \"tala\" to refer to both blue and green. One has to deduce from the context and prior knowledge, of what is being talked about, to be able to pinpoint exactly the color in question.\n\nThe Himba people use a single word for shades of green and blue: \"buru\". They curiously have only three other colour names, and their color perception has been studied by anthropologists.\n\nThe language of the Kanien'kehá:ka Nation at Akwesasne is at Stage VII on the , and thus possesses distinct terms for a broad range of spectral and non-spectral colours, including blue (\"oruía\"), green (\"óhute\"), black (\"kahúji\"), white (\"karákA\"'), and grey (\"atakArókwa\"). According to one researcher, the Nation's term for purple (\"arihwawakunéha\"), which translates to 'bishop['s colour]', a recent coinage. The way in which purple was categorized and referenced prior to the addition of the latter term is not clear.\n\nIn the Lakota Sioux language, the word \"tȟó\" is used for both blue and green, though the word \"tȟózi\" (a mixture of the words \"tȟó\" meaning \"blue (green),\" and \"zí\" meaning \"yellow\") has become common (\"zítȟo\" can also be used). This is in line with common practice of using \"zíša/šázi\" for Orange (\"šá\" meaning \"red\"), and \"šátȟo/tȟóša\" for \"purple/violet.\"\n\nThe Choctaw language has two words, \"okchʋko\" and \"okchʋmali\", which have different meanings depending on the source. In 1852 \"okchakko\" is translated variously as pale blue or pale green, \"okchakko chohmi\" (\"somewhat okchakko\") is given as swarthy, and \"okchamali\" is defined as deep blue, gray, green, or sky blue. In 1880 \"okchakko\" and \"okchʋmali\" are both given as blue, and green is not specifically listed as a color. In an 1892 dictionary, \"okchamali\" is deep blue or green, \"okchakko\" is pale blue or bright green, and a third word \"kili̱koba\" is bright green (resembling a \"kili̱kki\", a species of parrot). By 1915, the authoritative Byington dictionary gives \"okchako\" as blue and \"okchamali\" as green, blue, gray, verdant. A current coursebook differentiates based on brightness, giving \"okchʋko\" as bright blue/green and \"okchʋmali\" as pale or dull blue/green. Modern usage in the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma language school is to use \"okchʋko\" for blue and \"okchʋmali\" for green, with no distinction for brightness.\n\nSingle words for blue/green are also found in Mayan languages; for example in the Yukatek Maya language \"blue/green\" is \"yax\".\n\nTupian languages did not originally differ between the two colors, though they may now as a result of interference of Spanish (in the case of Guaraní) or Portuguese (in the case of Nheengatu). The Tupi word \"oby\" () meant both as does the Guaraní \"hovy\" (). In modern tupi (nheengatu) you can use the word \"suikiri\" for green and \"iakira/akira\" for blue, but they are still interchangeable, because \"iakira/akira\" also means immature, as in \"pakua akira\" (green banana/immature banana), and \"suikiri\" can also mean blue. In modern guarani, they use \"hovy\" for blue and \"hovy'û\" (which literally means \"dark green/blue) for green. So \"hovy\" can still be used for green\" and \"hovy'û\" can be used for dark blue shades. They also have the word \"aky\", cognate with nheengatu \"akira\", and it means green/immature too.\n\nThe Yebamasa of the Rio Piraparana region in Vaupés Department, southeastern Colombia, use the term \"sumese\" for blue/green. The letter \"u\" is pronounced like the German \"ü\".\n\nMapudungun distinguishes between black (\"kurü\"), blue (\"kallfü\") and green (\"karü\", also meaning \"raw\" or \"immature\"). The word \"payne\" was formerly used to refer to a sky blue, and also refers to the bluish color of stones (Zúñiga, 2006).\n\n"}

He was the son of \"Abeto\" Adigo. He may be identical with the Emperor Solomon whom the traveler Henry Salt lists as one of the Emperors still alive at the time of his visit in 1809/1810.\n\nRichard Pankhurst credits him with the construction of Qeddus Fasilides (\"St. Basilides,\" literally \"Holy Basilides\") church in Gondar. The chronicler Alaqa Gabru appears to suggest, in a confusing passage, that Salomon was blinded before he was deposed.\n\nSalomon was made Emperor by \"Ras\" Haile Yosadiq, \"Dejazmach\" Wand Bewossen, and \"Dejazmach\" Kenfu Adam after they deposed Tekle Haymanot II. One of Salomon's first acts as Emperor was to make a series of appointments: \"Ras\" Ayadar became the \"Ras Betwoded\", Kenfu Adam governor of Damot, Wand Bewsossen governor of Begemder, \"Dejazmach\" Hailu Adara governor of Gojjam, \"Dejazmach\" Hailu Eshte governor of Semien, and \"Basha\" Mebaras Boqatu deputy to the \"Blattengeta\".\n\nDespite the consensus of the major nobles of the Empire to support Salomon, \"Azaj\" Salassie Barya brought Tekle Giyorgis from the royal prison on Wehni as a pretender to the throne. Salomon responded by marching out from Gondar; Tekle Giyorgis then fled to Tigray, whence he emerged in the month of Sane at the head of an army which was rumored to be \"a large force\". Tekle Giyorgis was defeated outside of Gondar and returned to Wehni.\n\nThis victory was followed, however, with a battle at Sabisabar between \"Ras\" Haile Yosadiq and Kenfu Adam. Kenfu Adam was victorious, and Emperor Salomon, who was with \"Ras\" Haile Yosadiq, was captured by Kenfu Adam and became Kenfu's figurehead. Salomon shortly afterwards convinced \"Dejazmach\" Hailu Eshte to join forces with him and Kenfu; the \"Dejazmach\" did so after peace was first established between the two enemies. Together the allies raided Filakit Gereger, then the capital of Begemder province; Boqatu, who had succeeded his brother Wand Bewossen as governor on the latter's death, was forced to flee his palace in Felakit Gereger.\n\nNot long after a second battle was fought against Boqatu, which went badly for Salomon and his handlers. Kenfu Adam and Hailu Adara then conspired to make Tekle Giyorgis emperor and brought him down from Wehni once again. Kenfu Adam went to Dera, against the wishes of Emperor Salomon, then attempted to seize \"Ras\" Hailu Yosadiq but failed; peace was made between them. At this point, Kenfu took both the Emperor and Tekle Giyorgis to his province of Damot, and on 17 July 1779 at Yebaba proclaimed Tekle Giyorgis the new emperor and announced that Salomon had become a monk.\n\nThe latest chronological mention of Salomon in the \"Royal chronicle\" is when Emperor Tekle Giyorgis learned on 25 March 1780 that Kenfu Adam had brought Salomon down from Wehni to replace him as Emperor. However Kenfu Adam was defeated in battle 25 May at Maryam Weha by Boqatu, leading Kenfu Adam to being imprisoned and Salomon presumably returned to the Royal prison on Wehni.\n"}

She is a singer in Latin America; especially in those Latin American countries bordered by the Caribbean Sea, and in the eastern seaboard region of the United States. She is also known as Merengue Queen. She has won four Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nMilly Quezada was born in Santo Domingo, the daughter of two Cibao natives and sister of four musician brothers. Growing up in such a musical family, Quezada became interested in music as a toddler—she would sing along with her brothers for family, friends and small gatherings near her home.\n\nShe expressed an interest in developing her singing talents as a young girl, and, partly for this reason the Quezada family moved to New York City when she was still a child.\n\nMilly spent her pre-teen and teen years in New York, a city that is well known as a school for Merengue and Salsa singers from its Latino barrios, e.g. Spanish Harlem. In New York, Quezada developed an in-depth knowledge of her favorite musical genre, the fastest of the Latin American popular dance music styles, sung in Spanish and native to the Dominican Republic (see also Son Cubano, Rumba, Salsa, Cha-Cha-Cha, and Punta for comparison, as well as Kompa, the style sung in Haitian Creole in neighboring Haiti).\n\nShe completed her primary and secondary school in New York City and graduated cum laude from City College of New York ‘1981 in Communications and Mass Media. She also graduated with a Paralegal degree ‘1992 from Katherine Gibbs School, Montclair, NJ.\n\nHer musical inclinations developed as a pastime in the streets of Washington Heights where she formed with her brothers and sister, the group that would become known as Milly Jocelyn & Los Vecinos. Their music would identify the growing Hispanic Community of Dominicans in Washington Heights and their distinctly feminist style of Merengue captured the hearts and imagination of the growing Hispanic Community. Hits that would rise in popularity during the ‘70s 80s and 90s include \"Volvio Juanita,\" “La Guacherna,\" “Tengo,\" and many other songs that would go on to become Christmas hits on national and international music platforms. Led by her oldest brother and musical arranger, Rafael Quezada, the \"Queen of Merengue\" along with the group would travel worldwide and become pioneers in the female-led musical Orchestra modality. They were first to bring live Dominican Merengue to major cities in Japan: Tokyo, Nagasaki and Osaka~ and regularly tour countries such as Madrid, Spain, Central and South America and many states with the United States where the Dominican Diaspora thrived. The group was also first in entertaining a Presidential Inaugural Gala in 1990: President George W. Bush Sr. in Washington, D.C. \n\nQuezada later decided to embark on a solo career, moving to Puerto Rico where she also married and became a mother, enjoying even more success as a solo artist. Since the 1990s, Quezada has been either on tour or in recording studios almost constantly, earning several prestigious awards and public recognition such as keys to cities (see below).\n\nIn January 1996 Milly's life was turned upside down with the passing away of her husband, manager and father of three young sons ~Rafael Vasquez~ forcing her to take a break from her musical career which had reached twenty years and twenty long playing records at this tragic moment in her life and the lives of her family. In 1997 she was encouraged by her longtime friend and manager, Pedro Nuñez del Risco, to retake her musical recording career which marked a \"before\" and \"after\" in her musical accomplishments. Along with the aforementioned hits, Milly Quezada went on to popularize songs like, \"Lo Tengo Todo\" “Entre tu Cuerpo y el Mío\" “Porque me Amaste, \"Para darte mi Vida\" “Vive\" “Toma mi Vida\" amongst many other songs.\n\nThe \"Queen of Merengue\" went on to be nominated and received multiple national and international awards in the Tropical Music genre such as, four Latin Grammy Awards to date; Premios Cassandra Awards in the Dominican Republic including the highest honor in her genre \"Premio Soberano\" in 1997. Billboard awards and Univision's Premio Lo Nuestro in 1998, ACE Awards in New York, \"Tu Musica\" award as well as \"Premios Globo in NYC and in Barranquilla, Colombia various \"Congo de Oro\" awards during several annual Carnaval de Barranquilla tours performed. Her well known Carnaval Song \"La Guacherna\" written by Esther Forero, is recognized along with Barranquilla's Carnival by the coveted \"Worldwide Cultural Heritage\" issued by UNESCO. Milly's been recognized by both the Senate of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as well as the Mayor's Office of New York City for her cultural contribution to the music of the Americas.\n\nOTHER AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS\n\nIn early 2009, Milly joined eleven other Dominican music legends on a national tour celebrating the merengue and bachata music traditions of the country. That tour was transformed into a Felix Limardo documentary entitled Sol Caribe. The movie features an original song, La Puerta del Nuevo Mundo that is a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration of the twelve stars. The film was the closing feature at the III Dominican Republic Global Film Festival in November 2009 and was attended by the President of the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn addition to the Cassandra Awarded movie, \"Yuniol 2\" Milly has played important roles in the movies: “Cal y Arena,” Puerto Rico; “Hermanos R.D.” in Dominican Republic and the soon to be released movie “Juanita” written produced and directed by Leticia Tonos and which will be released in December 2018.\n\nFour decades in the musical industry including 31 records sponsored by various recording labels finds the \"Queen of Merengue\" producing album No. 32 featuring various artists and tapping into the cultural wealth of Dominican talents, producers, arrangers and featured artists. Among featured songs available through various digital platforms in internet are: “Que Tiene Ella,” written and arranged by Ramon Orlando; \"Mejor que a ti Me Va\" written by Juan Carlos Rodriguez of Tercer Cielo, arranged by Ramon Orlando; \"Que Lluevan Corazones,\" written by Milly's son, Anthony Vasquez, arranged by Janina Rosado; \"La Pimienta es la que Pica\" feat. Maridalia Hernandez and Fefita la Grande, arranged by Jochy Sanchez; scheduled for early 2019 radio airing is an interesting bolero duet with Gilberto Santa Rosa, \"Rutina\" also arranged by Jochy Sanchez. Currently airing nationally is the song, \"De Colores\" featuring Vladimir Dotel of the Urban Group, Ilegales; written by Chris Hierro and arranged by Antonio Gonzalez with its online YouTube video rapidly closing in to the one million views. This untitled album as of yet promises to showcase the true colors of all that is pure Dominican flavor talent and \"Criollo\" identification through its red, white and blue colors of its musical flag! \n\n\nQuezada has recorded many solo albums, receiving a Latin Grammy for \"Pienso asi\", \"MQ\" and \"Aquí Estoy Yo\".\n\n\nQuezada has received many awards during her career, such as the aforementioned Grammy. Arguably, one of the highest honors a person or celebrity can receive is the \"key to a city,\" usually presented by that city's mayor. Here is a list of cities that have given Quezada that symbolic award:\n\n\n\n"}

By September, the Midtown Plaza on North Main Street was selected as the site for the arena. Lauridon then committed $5 million to the $15 million project. In July 1999, five downtown businesses were notified of eviction from their properties and Elmira City Council unanimously voted to begin eminent domain proceedings against Paul Navestad, the only property owner whom the city could not reach an agreement. Demolition began on September 21. Thomas Freeman, president of Coach USA Transit Services, signed an agreement to pay $1 million for the arena to be called the Coach USA Center. By October 4, the Chemung County Legislature requested the $7.25 million promised by Lauridon Sports Management and its private investor for the project, Mostafa Afr of Ann Arbor, Michigan, must be in place by December 1, or the county would pull its $1.25 million in support for the project. On October 26: Key Bank approved Afr's application for a $7.25 million loan to help build the center. The arena then held its groundbreaking ceremony on November 24, 1999.\n\nOn January 28, 2000, the Chemung County Industrial Development Agency closed on the county's $1.25 million loan to the project and the rest of the financing was completed in February with the Afrs and a vice president from Key Bank in Albany closed on a $5.5 million loan. Tamer Afr, Mostafa Afr's son and business partner, announced that Global Spectrum had replaced Lauridon Sports Management as the arena facility manager. This lasted three months before they announced that SMG would manage the arena instead. The City Council also approved a roof design for the project in June 2000 that increased the estimated cost of the arena to $16 million.\n\nOn March 27, 2000, the United Hockey League awarded an expansion franchise to Elmira to begin play in the 2000–01 season. The team name was revealed as the Elmira Jackals. The Twin Tier Amateur Hockey Association and Tamer Afr also signed a contract for youth hockey to be played at the arena. On November 11, the first event is held at the center when the Jackals played their home opener against the Knoxville Speed. The Moody Blues were the first musical entertainment at the arena the following night.\n\nIn October 2003, the Coach USA Center was renamed First Arena. In April 2006, Mostafa Afr announced that Robbie Nichols would take over operation of both First Arena and the Jackals. He became the arena's eighth general manager in less than six years and its fourth manager in the past year.\n\nOn October 31, 2007, Elmira Downtown Arena (EDA), the arena operator, entered into an Installment Agreement to pay taxes on which it had defaulted. EDA then defaulted on the agreement on March 31, 2008. From 2009 to 2011, the arena continued to fail to pay its taxes. On January 17, 2012, the 4:30 p.m. deadline passed to pay $123,849 in overdue taxes and a foreclosure order was then signed by Chemung County Court judge Peter Buckley, starting a \"redemption period\" that was to end February 29. During that period, Southern Tier Economic Development (STED), the arena's owner, could get the property back by paying the overdue tax balance plus a 10% penalty totaling $136,234. On March 12, the county legislature voted to table an attempt by STED to buy back the arena. The legislature also called for the hiring of a consultant to investigate the arena's financial status and physical condition.\n\nThe EDA responded on March 22, 2012, by filing a lawsuit against Chemung County, county executive Tom Santulli, county treasurer Joseph Sartori and STED to try to force the county to accept the repurchase offer on the arena. EDA and M-Team LLC, a Michigan corporation, also filed a lawsuit against former arena general manager Robbie Nichols and former assistant general manager Donald Lewis alleging they attempted to sabotage the arena operator, the Jackals and First Arena. EDA and Key Bank filed two more lawsuits in April accusing the county of not following proper procedure in administering its foreclosure process. County judge Judith O'Shea dismissed the lawsuit filed March 22 against county officials and the suit filed against Nichols and Lewis. On May 17, 2012, a memorandum of understanding was signed by Tamer Afr for EDA, Santulli for the county and Kevin Keeley as president of STED that allowed the Jackals to play in the facility during the 2012–13 season. The agreement also allowed EDA to continue operating the arena but gave the county the same rights as STED to oversee arena operations.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, officials announced that Elm Arena LLC, a group headed by Tom Freeman, president of First Air in Big Flats, had been named as the new operator of First Arena, replacing the Afr family. The agreement ended all pending litigation. On April 10, the Jackals held a press conference to name Tom Freeman and Nathan Cook the new owners of the First Arena and the Jackals. In September 2014, the Jackals were donated from Freeman to a private non-profit community organization, Twin Tiers Economic Development (TTED), a 30-member board to oversee the organization.\n\nOn January 28, 2016, the Chemung County Industrial Development Agency (IDA) entered into an \"option to purchase agreement\" with a down payment of $300,000, giving the IDA time to consider all factors and options about the future of the arena. The IDA then assumed temporary ownership of First Arena and the Jackals until a new owner can be found beginning in April 2016. The IDA gave tours of the facility to several potential buyers hoping to be in a position to select a buyer by late July or early August 2016. However, no purchase proposals were received by the June 24 deadline. Negotiations continued with three interested parties. On August 24, the process had been narrowed to one party, who was also interested in buying the Jackals. The IDA hoped to complete the transaction by January 2017.\n\nIn January 2017, the Chemung County legislature voted to maintain the arena to be open to the public but asked the Elmira City Council to contribute nearly $1.5 million of taxpayer money over five years to repair the ice plant and repay back bills. They council voted against it saying that doing so would require a 3% property tax increase. The Chemung County IDA sarguedys that they only had enough funds to operate the arena for another week. On February 10, the IDA presented a counteroffer to the Elmira City Council asking for $750,000 to repair the ice plant. They indicated that an answer is required by close of business on February 13, but extended the deadline for an answer from the city to the morning of February 16. The council decided that they would be unable to provide any financial assistance to the county for First Arena. The IDA hoped to be able to keep the arena open until the Jackals' season ends in mid-April.\n\nOn March 7, the potential buyer dropped the request for taxpayer funding. The buyer also needed to submit paperwork to the ECHL by March 9 to ask for approval for a change in ownership, and to affirm that the Jackals would play the next season. On March 10, it was announced that local businessman Brian Barrett would take ownership of First Arena, but the Jackals would cease operations at the conclusion of the 2016–17 season. Finalization of the deal was contingent upon the new owner obtaining another hockey franchise. Possibilities were from an announced new amateur league called the International Developmental Hockey League (IDHL), which listed a team called the Elmira Express on its web site, or the Federal Hockey League, a low-level professional league. The Jackals played their final game on April 8, 2017. On June 27, 2017, Barrett backed out of negotiations for buying the arena.\n\nOn July 5, 2017, Elmira Pioneers co-owner and former Jackals coach and general manager Robbie Nichols expressed a desire to bring a Federal Hockey League team to Elmira for the 2017–18 season. However, after meeting with county officials and the IDA, Nichols announced that they could not come to an agreement and the plan was put on hold. Robbie Nichols offered to lease the arena for a minimum of two years but the IDA rejected the proposal, saying it would leave them financially exposed. The IDA presented a counter proposal to Nichols, which he and his group rejected.\n\nOn October 3, 2017, the City of Elmira approved a resolution proposed by the IDA to apply for a \"Restore New York\" grant to help repair the arena's ice plant and roof. The repairs were intended to help the IDA get the building up to par so it can be sold. Only cities can apply for such a grant. In January 2018, the IDA was still trying to get professional or college hockey into First Arena, focusing on Elmira College, located a few blocks from the arena, whose team was using the Murray Athletic Center, eight miles from campus.\n\nOn June 25, 2018, the IDA reopened negotiations with Robbie Nichols to bring a Federal Hockey League team to Elmira with Nichols leasing the arena, not purchasing it. On July 17, Nichols and the IDA announced that Nichols would lease the arena for a year with renewals for the following two years and an option to purchase. Nichols brought in a Federal Hockey League (FHL) franchise and intends to hold other events. The new FHL team was announced as the Elmira Enforcers and began play in the 2018–19 season.\n\nFirst Arena is mostly known for the Elmira Jackals ice hockey team that competed in the ECHL and the United Hockey League between 2000 and 2017. First Arena has also hosted many other sporting events such as basketball, X-treme Ice Racing, and pro wrestling from WWE and TNA Wrestling.\n\nIn 2018, the minor professional Elmira Enforcers began play as a member of the Federal Hockey League. The team is owned by Elmira Pioneers co-owner Robbie Nichols, who also has the option to purchase the arena.\n\nThe arena also hosts musical acts, family productions, and many other large entertainment performances such as concerts and circuses.\n\nThe following is a partial list of notable concerts and other entertainment events that have taken place at First Arena:\n\n"}

{"id": "1936928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936928", "title": "Grand Canyon Railway", "text": "Grand Canyon Railway\n\nThe Grand Canyon Railway , is a heritage railroad which carries passengers between Williams, Arizona, and the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park.\n\nThe railroad, built by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, was completed on September 17, 1901. The arrival of trains led increased tourism to the area, and the railway company was instrumental in the creation of the Grand Canyon Village to serve guests.\n\nDeclining ridership due to the popularity of the automobile led the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to cease passenger service of the Grand Canyon Railway in July 1968 and freight service on the line ended in 1974.\n\nThe railway resumed operations in the late 1980s. After private investors purchased the line in 1988 and restored the facilities, passenger trains started running again on September 17, 1989.\n\nToday, the railroad carries hundreds of passengers to and from the canyon every day and operates year-round.\n\nThe entire Grand Canyon Railway has been added to the National Register of Historic Places, recognizing the contribution the train has made to the history of the United States.\n\nIn 1901, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway completed a branch line from Williams to Grand Canyon Village at the South Rim. The first scheduled train to carry paying passengers of the Grand Canyon Railway arrived from Williams on September 17 of that year. The long trip cost $3.95, and naturalist John Muir later commended the railroad for its limited environmental impact. To accommodate travelers, the Santa Fe designed and built the El Tovar Hotel, located just from the Canyon Rim. El Tovar opened its doors in January 1905.\nCompetition with the automobile forced the Santa Fe to cease operation of the Grand Canyon Railway in July 1968 (only three passengers were on the last run), although Santa Fe continued to use the tracks for freight until 1974.\n\nPlans by entertainer Arthur Godfrey to resume service in 1977 fell through. In addition, two other companies attempted to resurrect the line in 1980 and 1984, with each attempt helping to maintain interest in preserving the line and saving it from scrapping.\n\nIn 1988, the line was bought by Max and Thelma Biegert, a couple from Phoenix, Arizona. The railway was restored and in 1989 began operations as a separate company, independent of the Santa Fe. The first run of the restored railroad was on September 17, 1989, commemorating the September 17 debut of the original railroad.\n\nThe Biegerts, a couple originally from Nebraska, had made their fortune in crop dusting through Biegert Aviation, founded in 1947, which had a large federal government contract for its B-17 and later C-54 fleet. After leaving the crop-dusting business, they operated a for-profit day care business in Houston, Texas, which became the Children's World Learning Center and is now part of KinderCare Learning Centers. The Biegerts never intended to get into the rail business. They had loaned money secured by the tracks to another person for the rail line. When they defaulted the Biegerts took over the line. In conjunction with the startup, the Biegerts were principal investors in the short-lived Farwest Airlines, an air taxi service operating a DHC Dash 7 that was intended to bring tourists from California, Las Vegas and Phoenix to Flagstaff where the passengers would then take the rail line.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Grand Canyon Railway purchased a fleet of 1950s-era ALCO FA Diesel-electric locomotives, featuring an iconic \"snub nose\" design. The fleet consisted of two cab-equipped lead A unit models and two cabless booster B unit models. The new locomotives supplemented the fleet of steam locomotives and allowed the railway to grow into a year-round operation. \n\nThe ALCO FA locomotives lacked the features found in more modern units, such as increased horsepower and dynamic brakes. Therefore, in February 2003, the Grand Canyon Railway purchased three late-1970s F40PH locomotives from Amtrak and placed them into service in 2004.\n\nIn March 2006, owners Max and Thelma Biegert announced to the media that they were placing the railroad and its associated restaurants, hotels and amenities up for sale. The combined properties had an annual revenue of nearly $40 million. The Biegerts sought a new buyer/operator with a possible theme park background, which would ensure that the railroad, hotels, RV park, restaurants (and a possible new amusement park in Williams) would continue to be operated as one entity.\n\nOn September 21, 2006, it was announced that Xanterra Parks & Resorts of Denver, Colorado, submitted the winning bid (for an undisclosed sum) and was selected as the new owner for the Grand Canyon Railway. Xanterra is the corporate name and identity for what was originally known as the Fred Harvey Company, a company with restaurant, hotel and service ties to the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway as far back as 1876.\n\nXanterra said that it intended to keep all 480 of the railway's current employees, and planned to focus on growing the business and increasing the coordination between the railway and Xanterra's other services in the Grand Canyon National Park's South Rim. In the press release, the railway and Xanterra reported over 225,000 passengers and over $38 million in revenue in calendar year 2005. The purchase of the GCR included all of the railway's assets, depots, hotels, RV park, rolling stock, shops and the land on which the line operates over. \nSteam locomotive operations on the Grand Canyon Railway were suspended in September 2008. Xanterra cited environmental concerns as the reason for the decision, pointing out that each roundtrip of a steam locomotive consumed 1,450 gallons of diesel fuel (compared to the 550 gallons used by a diesel-electric locomotive) and 1,200 gallons of water. Industry experts said that ridership losses due to the late 2000s recession and rising fuel prices due to the 2000s energy crisis likely contributed to the decision.\n\nSteam locomotives would return to the Grand Canyon Railway on September 19, 2009. Xanterra converted the steam locomotives to operate using waste vegetable oil collected from restaurants across Northern Arizona and installed a rainwater collection system on the maintenance building to fill boilers when available. Since 2011, special occasion trips, and at least one roundtrip per month during the summer is operated using a steam locomotive.\n\nIn 2017, the Grand Canyon Railway added to its fleet of diesel locomotives, purchasing two additional F40PH units from New Jersey Transit.\n\nThe railroad carries hundreds of passengers to and from the canyon every day, totaling about 225,000 people per year.\n\nThe restored Santa Fe Railway Station in Williams serves as the southern terminus for the Grand Canyon Railway and the Grand Canyon Depot, owned by the National Park Service, is the northern terminus for passengers of the line.\nMost trains are pulled by the Railway's fleet of F40PH diesel locomotives, all designated F40FH by the railroad. Steam locomotives pull trains on special holidays and the first Saturday of the peak travel season (March through October). The Grand Canyon Railway's fleet of historic ALCO FA diesel locomotives also see occasional use.\n\nPassengers ride to and from the Grand Canyon in 1950s era climate-controlled coaches. During the peak travel season, 1920s era Pullman Harriman style coaches with open windows are also available.\n\nThe railroad adds to the Old West experience by having actors dressed as bandits stage a mock train robbery during the return trip from the Grand Canyon to Williams.\n\nThe Grand Canyon Railway offers at least one daily round trip of its Williams Flyer train between Williams and the Grand Canyon every day except on Christmas Day, December 25. During peak demand periods a second train departure is added.\n\nDuring the winter season (November – January), the line runs \"The Polar Express\" from Williams to the 'North Pole', a station about north of town. In 2008, this winter service carried about 78,000 passengers.\n\nThe route included stops at Quivero, Valle, Willaha, and Coconino stations.\n\nThe entire Grand Canyon Railway has been added to the National Register of Historic Places for being associated with events that made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of the history of the United States. In the nomination to the register, the railroad was credited with, \"Opening up of a large area north of Williams, the building of the Grand Canyon National Park facilities at the south rim, establishment of a solid tourist trade in the American Southwest, support of cattle and sheep ranching, copper and uranium mining, lumber industries, and the building of a sub culture around the railroad that continues to this day.\"\n\nThe Grand Canyon Depot was added to the register on September 6, 1974, while the Williams Depot and the rest of the railroad between Williams and the Grand Canyon National Park was added as a Historic District on August 23, 2000. The Grand Canyon Depot was also designated as a National Historic Landmark on May 28, 1987 for its outstanding historical significance.\n\n"}

It appears in Episcopal Registers as \"Buneya\" in 1227. The name means either 'reed island' or 'island on the river Bune'.\n\nThere has been a settlement on the site since pre-Norman times, perhaps as far back as the days of the Roman Empire. The parish Church of St Mary is 14th century. The most significant building in the village is Bunny Hall, probably built in the 1570s and occupied by the Parkyns family for three hundred years. Sir Thomas Parkyns (1662–1741), known as the Wrestling Baronet, built what is now the north wing to his own design circa 1723–25. He also built the school and almshouses. Thomas Parkyns was a devotee of wrestling and organised an annual wrestling match in Bunny Park (prize a gold-laced hat). These matches continued until 1810.

The BCS theory of superconductivity explains superconductivity as the result of the condensation of electric charges to Cooper pairs. In a dual superconductor an analogous effect occurs through the condensation of magnetic charges (also called magnetic monopoles). In ordinary electromagnetic theory, no monopoles have been shown to exist. However, in quantum chromodynamics — the theory of colour charge which explains the strong interaction between quarks — the colour charges can be viewed as (non-abelian) analogues of electric charges and corresponding magnetic monopoles are known to exist. Dual superconductor models posit that condensation of these magnetic monopoles in a superconductive state explains colour confinement — the phenomenon that only neutrally coloured bound states are observed at low energies. \n\nQualitatively, confinement in dual superconductor models can be understood as a result of the dual to the Meissner effect. The Meissner effect says that a superconducting metal will try to expel magnetic field lines from its interior. If a magnetic field is forced to run through the superconductor, the field lines are compressed in magnetic flux \"tubes\" known as fluxons. In a dual superconductor the roles of magnetic and electric fields are exchanged and the Meissner effect tries to expel electric field lines. Quarks and antiquarks carry opposite colour charges, and for a quark–antiquark pair 'electric' field lines run from the quark to the antiquark. If the quark–antiquark pair are immersed in a dual superconductor, then the electric field lines get compressed to a flux tube. The energy associated to the tube is proportional to its length, and the potential energy of the quark–antiquark is proportional to their separation. The energy of colored objects becomes infinite. A quark–antiquark will therefore always bind regardless of their separation, which explains why no unbound quarks are ever found.\n\nDual superconductors are described by (a dual to) the Landau–Ginzburg model, which is equivalent to the Abelian Higgs model. The MIT bag model boundary conditions for gluon fields are those of the dual color superconductor.\n\nThe dual superconductor model is motivated by several observations in calculations using lattice gauge theory. The model, however, also has some shortcomings. In particular, although it confines coloured quarks, it fails to confine colour of some gluons, allowing coloured bound states at energies observable in particle colliders.\n\n"}

{"id": "1936956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936956", "title": "Little Norway", "text": "Little Norway\n\nLittle Norway (), officially (FTL, \"Air Force Training Camp\"), was a Norwegian Army Air Service/Royal Norwegian Air Force training camp in southern Ontario during the Second World War.\n\nWhen Nazi Germany attacked Norway on 9 April 1940, with only a small number of modern aircraft, the Norwegian Army Air Service and Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service were unable to mount a sustained defense. Following the defeat of the Norwegian forces, the King, key members of the government and military left Norway in June 1940 aboard .\n\nAfter arriving in England, the Norwegian government-in-exile began the process of setting up a new base of operations. A decision was swiftly made to keep the existing Norwegian pilots that had escaped to England as an independent unit. Consequently, none were allowed to participate in the Battle of Britain. Arrangements were made to transfer Norwegian pilots to a North American headquarters. Various locations were considered, and a base around the Toronto Island Airport in Toronto was chosen. Once the base was established, young Norwegians migrated to the site to enroll in the Royal Norwegian Air Forces (RNAF).\n\nIn 1939, Bernt Balchen, a Norwegian aviator enlisted with the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service, made his way to the United States on a crucial mission to negotiate \"matters pertaining to aircraft ordnance and ammunition with the question of the Norwegian Government's possible purchase of such materials in the United States of America.\" With his status of holding dual Norwegian and U.S. citizenship and his extensive contacts in the aviation industry, his instruction from the Norwegian Government-in-exile in London changed to a new directive: to set up a training camp and school for expatriate Norwegian airmen and soldiers in Canada. Balchen negotiated directly with Canadian government officials to obtain an agreement to use available airport facilities at the Toronto Island airport on Lake Ontario known as \"Little Norway\".\n\nAfter construction of new facilities had started, other Norwegian military staff took over with Col. Oscar Klingenberg chosen to head the training schools and Georg Unger Vetlesen and Thor Solberg able to deal with US aircraft manufacturers handling the procurement orders for military equipment. The greatest need revolved around the requirement for more combat pilots, necessitating placing orders in summer 1940 for 36 Fairchild PT-19s as a basic training aircraft. The first of the order began to arrive on 23 November 1940, being ferried in by American pilots. The initial batch of 10 PT-19s were supplemented by 26 PT-19As with a more powerful Ranger engine fitted. All of the series were retro-fitted in 1941 with canopies, converting the trainers into a PT-26 standard. Other operational aircraft, 24 Northrop N-3PBs and 35 Curtiss Hawk 75-A8s already on order (only five of the original order of 19 P-36s were undelivered, and were sent to Canada along with a further order for 36 new aircraft) were utilized as advanced trainers. Air defence forces were divided between Army and Naval Air Corps, with both services retaining their own commanding officers. The \"Little Norway\" camp was officially opened on 10 November 1940, located in the bay area of Toronto, on the shores of Lake Ontario. Its first commander was Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen. Major Ole Reistad took over early 1941.\n\nThe earliest considerations for Norwegian pilots was to have a separate air force operating out of England, but by late 1940, the Norwegian government-in-exile mandated that all the \"Little Norway\" student pilots were ultimately destined for Norwegian-staffed RAF squadrons. Although basic training took place in \"Little Norway\", by 1941, students selected as fighter pilots began to receive advance training at the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan base in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan on the NA Harvard. In 1943, the 30 surviving A-8 fighter trainers were sold back to the United States as P-36Gs. Initially, 36 Douglas DB-8A-5/A-33s (company numbers 715/750) on order from the United States were turned over in late 1940 for use as an advanced trainer. A decision to standardize on British types that would be used in operations led to arrangements being made later in 1941 for the flight training of Norwegian pilots to be carried out in RAF and RCAF schools. Consequently, the Model 8A-5s were declared surplus to Norwegian requirements and disposed of in sales abroad.\n\nWith the Norwegian Navy and Army pilot training operating as individual courses, there were inevitable commonalities and for the benefit of efficiency, the Norwegian government-in-exile consolidated both services into a unified force, renamed as the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The official declaration was made on 11 November 1944, although combined training operations were already taking place. In May 1942, the training camp was moved to a site at Muskoka Airport, about north of Toronto. Under the auspices of a Lend-Lease agreement, an additional order of 50 Fairchild PT-26/PT-26B Cornells was placed with the first deliveries being received by 1942. The training continued at Muskoka until February 1945, when the camp was moved to the air base at Winkleigh in Devon, England.\n\nAfter the move to England, the \"Norwegian Training Base\" as it was then known, was reconstituted under No. 23 Group RAF. The order for new Cornells was redirected to England, with many of the aircraft arriving by sea, still in their shipping crates. Additionally, nine Airspeed Oxfords and 27 Harvard advanced trainers were obtained. By 22 November 1945, the training was transferred to a base at Gardermoen, near Oslo, concentrating on primary training with the remaining 74 Cornells. The final move of the air training operation was to Rygge, where flight training continued until the end of hostilities and into the postwar period, being wound up in 1952, when all military training was transferred back to new training units in Norway.\n\nDuring flight training, there were several accidents with the loss of students and instructors.\n\nOn 20 June 1941, while taking off, a Northrop N-3PB collided with the ferry \"Sam McBride\" in Port Race, Toronto Harbour, killing both the student pilot, Tron Harsvik, and instructor, Lt. Finn Strand Kjos. The \"Toronto Star\" newspaper wrote that it was \"a matter of time before one of the Norwegian aircraft crashes in the city itself.\" This fear, along with it being impractical to have flight training in the same place as the current civil aviation operations, precipitated a move to a new camp in Muskoka. At the new location, both ab-initio and advanced level training could take place, while advanced flight training continued at Island Airport.\n\nThe first fatal accident in Muskoka, and the last one recorded by the FTL in Canada, took place August 1944 when a Fairchild PT-19 Cornell trainer with pilot and student aboard lost its wing and crashed into the ground, south of Gravenhurst; both on board died. The bodies were recovered from the dense undergrowth and a wing section was found, but no wreckage was recovered. Not long after, another Fairchild crashed for the same reason, but both occupants escaped by parachute. Fairchild aircraft were temporarily grounded, but after the cause of the accidents were determined and other aircraft repaired, Fairchilds were again in service. \n\nThe FTL lost three N-3PBs in Canada in fatal crashes, two near Vancouver (Jericho Beach and Patricia Bay), when the harbour in Toronto was frozen, along with the aircraft involved in the ferry boat accident. Other training accidents included fatal crashes in the Curtiss P-36s, one near Toronto in April 1941, another near Port Credit in July 1941 and a final loss into Lake Ontario in January 1942. In all, 23 people at the Air Force training camp died in flying accidents, in addition to the seven who died of disease, car accidents or by drowning.\n\nIn total during the war, over 2,500 Norwegian airmen of all categories (pilots, navigators and mechanics) were trained in the various bases of \"Little Norway\".\n\nIn 1986 the city of Toronto established Little Norway Park where the people of Norway have erected a plaque \"Little Norway: \"Lille Norge\"\" to commemorate the site of the original camp. In 2007 the governments of Norway and Canada made a memorial inside the Muskoka Airport terminal building to commemorate the Muskoka site.\n\nArmy\n\nNavy\n\n\n\n\n"}

GTFs, RNA polymerase, and the mediator (a multi-protein complex) constitute the basic transcriptional apparatus that first bind to the promoter, then start transcription. GTFs are also intimately involved in the process of gene regulation, and most are required for life.\n\nA transcription factor is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences (enhancer or promoter), either alone or with other proteins in a complex, to control the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA by promoting (serving as an activator) or blocking (serving as a repressor) the recruitment of RNA polymerase. As a class of protein, general transcription factors bind to promoters along the DNA sequence or form a large transcription preinitiation complex to activate transcription. General transcription factors are necessary for transcription to occur.\n\nIn bacteria, transcription initiation requires an RNA polymerase and a single GTF: sigma factor.\n\nIn archaea and eukaryotes, transcription initiation requires an RNA polymerase and a set of \"multiple\" GTFs to form a transcription preinitiation complex. The Transcription initiation by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II involves the following GTFs:\nRecognize TATA box\n\nA sigma factor is a protein needed only for initiation of RNA synthesis in bacteria. Sigma factors provide promoter recognition specificity to the RNA polymerase (RNAP) and contribute to DNA strand separation, then dissociating from the RNA polymerase core enzyme following transcription initiation. The RNA polymerase core associates with the sigma factor to form RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Sigma factor reduces the affinity of RNA polymerase for nonspecific DNA while increasing specificity for promoters, allowing transcription to initiate at correct sites. The core enzyme of RNA polymerase has five subunits (protein subunits) (~400 kDa). Because of the RNA polymerase association with sigma factor, the complete RNA polymerase therefore has 6 subunits: the sigma subunit-in addition to the two alpha (α), one beta (β), one beta prime (β'), and one omega (ω) subunits that make up the core enzyme(~450 kDa). In addition, many bacteria can have multiple alternative σ factors. The level and activity of the alternative σ factors are highly regulated and can vary depending on environmental or developmental signals.\n\nThe transcription preinitiation complex is a large complex of proteins that is necessary for the transcription of protein-coding genes in eukaryotes and archaea. It attaches to the promoter of the DNA (e.i., TATA box) and helps position the RNA polymerase II to the gene transcription start sites, denatures the DNA, and then starts transcription.\n\nThe assembly of transcription preinitiation complex follows these steps:\n\n"}

He served as superintendent of the United States Military Academy for 12 years. At the start of the American Civil War, then Colonel Delafield helped equip and send volunteers from New York to the Union Army. He also was in command of defenses around New York harbor from 1861 to April 1864. On April 22, 1864, he was promoted to Brigadier General in the Regular Army of the United States and Chief of Engineers. On March 8, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Delafield for appointment to the grade of brevet major general in the Regular Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866, reconfirmed due to a technicality on July 14, 1866. He retired from the US Army on August 8, 1866. He later served on two commissions relating to improvements to Boston Harbor and to lighthouses. He also served as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nRichard Delafield was born in New York City on September 1, 1798. He was one of the 14 children of John and Anne (\"née\" Hallett) Delafield. His father had emigrated to New York from England in 1788 and made a fortune as a merchant. Edward Delafield, a prominent American physician, Joseph Delafield, a lawyer and diplomant, and Rufus King Delafield, a banker and manufacturer, were among his brothers.\n\nHe was the first graduate of the United States Military Academy to receive a merit class standing, ranking first in the class of 1818. During his time at West Point he also became the first cadet teacher detailed as acting assistant professor of mathematics in 1815.\n\nCommissioned as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, he served as topographical draftsman for the American Boundary Commission, along with his brother Joseph Delafield. The commission established the northern boundary between the United States and Canada under the Treaty of Ghent.\n\nDelafield served as assistant engineer in the construction of Hampton Roads defenses from 1819–1824 and was in charge of fortifications and surveys in the Mississippi River delta area in 1824-1832. While superintendent of repair work on the Cumberland Road east of the Ohio River, he designed and built Dunlap's Creek Bridge in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, the first cast-iron tubular-arch bridge in the United States. Commissioned a major of engineers in July 1838, he was appointed superintendent of the Military Academy after the fire of 1838 and served till 1845. He designed the new buildings and the new cadet uniform that first displayed the castle insignia. He superintended the construction of coast defenses for New York Harbor from 1846 to 1855.\nIn the beginning of 1855, Delafield was appointed by the Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis a head of the board of officers, later called \"The Delafield Commission\", and sent to Europe to study the European military. The board included Captain George B. McClellan and Major Alfred Mordecai. They inspected the state of the military in Great Britain, Germany, the Austrian Empire, France, Belgium, and Russia, and served as military observers during the Crimean War. After his return in April 1856, Delafield submitted a report which was later published as a book by Congress, \"Report on the Art of War in Europe in 1854, 1855, and 1856\". The book was suppressed during the American Civil War due to fears that it would be instructive to Confederate engineers as it contained multiple drawings and descriptions of military fortifications.\n\nDelafield served as superintendent of the Military Academy again in 1856-1861. In January 1861, he was succeeded by Captain Pierre G. T. Beauregard, who was dismissed shortly after Beauregard's home state of Louisiana seceded from the Union, and Delafield returned as superintendent serving until March 1, 1861. In the beginning of the Civil War he advised the governor of New York Edwin D. Morgan during the volunteer force creation. Then, in 1861–1864, he was put in charge of New York Harbor defenses, including Governors Island and Fort at Sandy Hook. On May 19, 1864, he was commissioned a brigadier-general after replacing Joseph Gilbert Totten, who had died, as the Chief of Engineers, United States Army Corps of Engineers, on April 22, 1864.

The park is the largest of 24 state parks in Indiana, and occupies —making it one of the larger state parks in the United States. It is Indiana's most visited state park, and has about 1.3 million visitors each year. Although Bloomington, Indiana, is the closest city, the park is closer to the small town of Nashville in Brown County. Brown County is named for General Jacob Brown, who fought in the War of 1812 and became Commanding General of the United States Army.\n\nThe park opened in 1929, and was dedicated in 1932 as a memorial to Indiana humorist Frank McKinney \"Kin\" Hubbard. Although Hubbard lived and worked in Indianapolis, he was a frequent visitor to Nashville and the surrounding woods. The park's Abe Martin Lodge is named after Hubbard's fictional backwoodsmen character used to convey Hubbard's humor and witticisms.\n\nBrown County and its park are known for their scenic views of the hills of southern Indiana. Both are the home of a wide variety of trees that attract visitors each year when the vegetation transforms to its autumn colors. The park also contains many trees that flower in the springtime. Visitors will find a rustic atmosphere, enhanced by an infrastructure that was mostly constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s. In addition to the park's lodge, cabins can be rented and campsites are available. The park has trails for hiking, biking and horseback riding. It has two lakes for fishing that complement the surrounding forests and provide a water source for the local wildlife. The area's beauty attracts artists and photographers worldwide.\n\nBrown County was created in 1836 from portions of Monroe, Jackson, and Bartholomew counties, and is named after General Jacob Brown, a hero of the War of 1812. Early settlers tried farming in Brown County's hilly woodlands, leading them to clear the forests. Beginning in the 1840s and continuing for the rest of the century, most of Brown County's forests were cleared. At first, the largest trees were cut for lumber used in the construction industry. In later years, smaller trees were cleared for furniture wood, barrels, railroad ties, and firewood. The rugged land eventually became difficult to farm because of poor quality soil. A combination of poor farming practices and erosion caused by deforestation depleted the soil's nutrients. Many farmers abandoned the area.\n\nAt least two people played major roles in the creation of Brown County State Park. Richard Lieber, an Indianapolis businessman who became the first director of the Indiana Department of Conservation, visited Brown County in 1910. Lieber was so impressed with the beauty of the land that he built a cabin near Nashville and suggested that a portion of the county should be set aside for a state park. Lieber eventually became known as \"the father of Indiana's state parks\", and the state opened 10 state parks (including Brown County) during his tenure as director of the Indiana Department of Conservation. Lieber was not the only one from Indianapolis that was impressed with Brown County. In 1923, the Order of Elks expressed interest in establishing a state park in Brown County.\n\nLee Bright lived in the small Indiana town of Nashville in Brown County. Bright believed that creation of a state park would restore the economic health of the region through tourism. His idea proved difficult to accomplish, since Indiana law did not allow purchasing land for a state park using state funds. The law did allow funds to be used for a game preserve. By 1926, Bright, working as the state's agent, purchased enough land to start a game reserve in Brown County.\n\nBrown County's game preserve was created in late 1924. During November, 1924, the Indiana Department of Conservation appointed a game warden to manage the preserve. The new manager was a resident of Nashville, and familiar with the area. It was also announced that much of the land would be reforested. A total of of Brown County land was designated for the propagation of wildlife. Plans were made to surround the reserve with wire fencing, and game wardens patrolled the area. Deer and small game were brought in to propagate. Additional acreage was added in 1927, increasing the reserve to over . During the same year, an observation tower was constructed on Weed Patch Hill, the highest point in the area. A dam was constructed in 1928 to create an artificial lake that was expected to cover . It was planned to stock the lake with game fish then allow fishing after two or three years. The lake was completed by the spring of 1929, and plans were announced to build a second (and larger) lake. By January 1929, the preserve covered about . Funds from the sale of hunting and fishing licenses were used to acquire the additional land.\n\nIn 1927, the Indiana state legislature passed a law allowing county commissioners to acquire land for the purpose of establishing a state park, and donate the land to the state conservation department. Brown County State Park was the fourth such park established after this legislation. In 1929, Brown County commissioners gave the state conservation department of land adjacent to the Brown County Game Preserve for the creation of a state park. Four parks had been donated using other means before the legislation, making Brown County State Park Indiana's eighth state park.\n\nIn 1933, eleven Civilian Conservation Corps groups were established for Indiana's state forests, game preserves, and state parks. Each group had 200 workers involved in the construction of buildings, bridges, trails, roads, and water supplies. One project was a large shelter in the Brown County game preserve. After training, workers from the Corps arrived in Brown County in 1934. The Corps began constructing much of the park's extant infrastructure. They worked to prevent erosion by reforesting with walnut, pine, and spruce trees. A second camp for the Civilian Conservation Corps opened in the park in 1938. The CCC Trail—the park's Trail 2—is one built by the Corps.\n\nBeginning in 1941, the Brown County Game Preserve and Brown County State Park were unified as a single state park. Since that time, two portions of the park have been designated as nature preserves—giving them additional protection from development. Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve was established in 1970 and consists of in Ogle Hollow containing the rare yellowwood tree. The second preserve is the Ten O'Clock Line Nature Preserve. This preserve was designated in 2010, and is Indiana's largest. It also contains yellowwood trees, and is the home of some of Indiana's deep forest species, including the red bat, timber rattlesnake, and broad-winged hawk. The term \"Ten O'Clock Line\" refers to a treaty with the Miami Indians from the early 1800s.\n\nThe 1987 Pan American Games, hosted in Indianapolis (roughly north), utilized Brown County State Park as the venue for the road race cycling competition.\n\nFrank McKinney \"Kin\" Hubbard (1868 – 1930) was an American humorist-cartoonist whose humor and witticisms were expressed through fictional backwoods characters living in Brown County. His work (usually a cartoon and a sentence or two) appeared every day on the back page of the Indianapolis News, and was syndicated in about 200 newspapers throughout the country. Hubbard was named to the Ohio Journalism Hall of Fame in 1939, and the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame in 1967.\n\nIn 1932, Brown County State Park was dedicated in honor of Kin Hubbard. Abe Martin was Hubbard's main character, and Brown County State Park's Abe Martin Lodge is named in his honor. A picture of Hubbard hangs in the lounge of the lodge, and a collection of Hubbard memorabilia is in a room nearby.\n\nBrown County State Park is the largest of the 24 state parks managed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. It is in the center of Indiana's southern half, \"just minutes\" from the town of Nashville, Indiana. The park occupies in Brown County. It has three entrances, adjacent to state roads 46 and 135. The northern entrance is close to the Abe Martin Lodge, Saddle Barn, tennis courts and a swimming pool. Large trucks and recreational vehicles must use the western entrance, due to a historic covered bridge that has a 3-ton weight limit and a 9' overhead clearance at the northern entrance. Campers bringing horses must use the southeast entrance, which leads to a specialized campground with hitching posts known as the Horsemen's Camp. Interstate 65's Columbus exit is about east of the park. Indiana University and the city of Bloomington, Indiana, are less than away.\n\nBrown County is nationally known for its outdoor scenery and dramatic views from southern Indiana hilltops. Brown County State Park affords a number of vistas that overlook wide swaths of deciduous forest that display a large array of colors in the fall. Peak visitation is in the fall during the leaf-changing season. In spring the dogwood, redbud, and serviceberry trees are in bloom. About 1.3 million people come to the park each year, including overseas visitors.\n\nBrown County State Park is sometimes called \"the Little Smokies\" because of similarities with the Smokey Mountains. Activities available in the park include camping, fishing, biking, hiking, and seasonal horseback riding. Many of these activities are available all year. Overnight visitors may stay in the campgrounds, rental cabins, or the Abe Martin Lodge. The park has a nature center and a nature preserve. Within the park boundaries are two manmade lakes: the Ogle Lake, and Strahl Lake. The park contains nine mountain bike trails totaling . Four of the trails are rated as beginner trails, two are considered intermediate, and two advanced. The last trail is rated for experts and is long. A total of slightly over of hiking trails range from easy to rugged terrain. The park has over of roads and of bridle trails. The third highest point in Indiana is located on Trail 10 near a high fire tower. This point, known as Weed Patch Hill, has an elevation of . When settlers first arrived at this hill, they found only a patch of weeds—a tornado had destroyed the trees—leading to the name. Hesitation Point is another vantage point for scenic views.\n\nThe most important tree in the park is the stain (\"Cladrastis lutea\"). This tree typically does not grow further north than central Kentucky, and has been designated as a state threatened species in Indiana. Other trees found in the park include at least four types of oak (black, chestnut, red, and white) and three types of hickory (bitternut, pignut, and shagbark). The park also contains at least two types of maple trees: black, sugar, red and silver. Patches of paw paw trees can be found throughout the park, and these trees produce an edible fruit. In areas with good moist soil, the black walnut tree grows. Among other trees growing in the park are the American beech, basswood, black cherry, black gum, and red elm. Also the sassafras, sycamore, white ash. The park also contains at least eight kinds of ferns and 20 types of wildflowers, including bloodroot and wild geranium.\n\nMammals typically found in Brown County State Park include white-tailed deer, bobcats, opossum, eastern gray squirrels, and chipmunks. The larger sycamore trees are sometimes the home of raccoons and flying squirrels. Red bats live in the park's Ten O'Clock Line nature preserve. Other animals include the American toad, the eastern box turtle, the spotted salamander, and the red-backed salamander. At least two species of venomous snakes live in the park: the timber rattlesnake and the copperhead. The two lakes contain bass and bluegill.\n\nThe park has good bird viewing areas along the trails, near the two lakes, and at the Nature Center. The hooded warbler, pileated woodpecker, and ruffed grouse nest in the park. Goldfinches and northern cardinals can be seen at feeders near the Nature Center. The pileated woodpecker, Acadian flycatcher, eastern wood pewee, white-breasted nuthatch, wood thrush, and yellow-billed cuckoo can all be observed in the park's Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve. Owls and woodpeckers are known to occupy sycamore trees. The cerulean warbler, whippoorwill, and broad-winged hawk all live in the Ten O'Clock Nature Preserve. Wild turkeys can be seen (and heard) along the park's Trail 10, known as the Fire Tower Trail. Other bird species in the park include the blue jay, the crow, the junco, the white-breasted nuthatch, and the robin.\n\nGlaciers from the most recent ice ages did not reach south far enough to flatten the land in Brown County, though glacier meltwater helped deepen gullies in the region, and made hills steeper. Brown County State Park's Weed Patch Hill is the highest point in the area, at above sea level. The region is part of the Knobstone Escarpment land form, which consists of steep hills and valleys located between northern Brown County and the Ohio River. The rocks in this area contain significant amounts of silica, and were part of a large delta system over 330 million years ago. Brown County's rocks are part of the Borden Group, and are mostly siltstone. Limestone, dolomite, and chert are the Borden Group's secondary rocks.\n\nThe Brown County area has a humid subtropical climate, classified as \"Cfa\" in the Köppen climate classification system. Precipitation is somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, and temperatures can be relatively high. The record high temperature over the last 99 years for county seat Nashville is . The record low over the last 99 years is . May is the month with the most precipitation, and February has the least. Most of the area's snowfall occurs in December, January, and February.\n\nThe park's Abe Martin Lodge, built in 1932, has 30 guest rooms, two lobbies, a gift shop, and a full-service restaurant. An annex to the lodge has 54 more rooms. An indoor water park was added recently. Rental cabins are available nearby. Each of 20 two-story family cabins can accommodate up to 8 people, and 56 rustic cabins are available. Campers have the choice of two classes of campgrounds—all with restrooms and showers. The Class A campgrounds have electrical hook-ups, while the Class B do not. A horseman's campground is available with one portion having electrical hook-ups, showers, and toilets—while the other portion is more primitive.\n\nSight seeing, birdwatching, mountain biking, fishing, hiking and horse riding are all popular activities at Brown County State park. The park has over of mountain bike trails, including trails endorsed by the International Mountain Bicycling Association and Bike Magazine. Four beginner trails are to long. The expert trail is long. During July 2018, Bicycling magazine named Brown County one of \"The Top 6 Secret Mountain Bike Destinations in the US\", and listed the park's recently completed Hobbs Hollow as a must-ride trail.\n\nFishing is available at two lakes to holders of a state fishing license. Bass and bluegill are stocked at Ogle Lake and the smaller Strahl Lake. Rowboats and electric trolling motors are permitted on Ogle Lake to holders of an Indiana Department of Natural Resources lake permit. Boats are not allowed on Strahl Lake. Licenses and permits are available at the park office, and bait at the park's country store.\n\nThe park has 12 hiking trails that total over . These trails can be used to access places of interest in the park, including the two lakes, the Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve, Hesitation Point, and lookout towers. The CCC Trail is a moderate difficulty trail built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. This trail \"crosses over impressive stone bridges, stairways, and retaining walls and passes by the Lower Shelter and the North Lookout Tower, both CCC projects\".\nHorseback riding is one of the fastest growing forms of recreation. Brown County State Park has over 20 horse trails, and 11 are wide enough that riders can ride two abreast. These trails range from to nearly in length. Horseback riders have their own entrance to the park, in the park's southeast corner, which leads to the horsemen's campground—also in the southeast of the park. There are facilities typical of the park's regular and primitive campgrounds and hitch rails. A maximum of six horses per campsite is allowed, and horse permits are mandatory. On the other side of the park, a saddle barn is open from late March through October. Trail rides with a guide, pony rides, and hayrides are available. The barn is located on the north side of the park, not far from the Abe Martin Lodge.\n\nWinter sports include cross-country skiing, sledding, and ice fishing. Cross-country skiing can be done in open fields within the park, though the park does not maintain any trails specifically for skiing, and does not rent ski equipment. Some hills suitable for sledding are located near the park's swimming pool. Ice fishing is allowed at both lakes for those with a state fishing license. Roads to the lakes sometimes closed due to ice or snow.\n\nA country store is open during the warm season with food, firewood, souvenirs, and bait for fishing. The nature center has a bird observation window and nature exhibits. The country store and nature center are located in the southern portion of the park. A swimming pool and tennis courts are located on the north side near the Abe Martin Lodge. The Olympic-size swimming pool is open from Memorial Day to no later than Labor Day. The park has at least 10 picnic areas, with tables and grills and some with nearby playgrounds and toilet facilities. Picnic shelters can be reserved for fees that vary by shelter.\nBrown County Dragway has been in business for over 50 years in Brown County and open in the summer months from April through October. Racing on an 1/8th mile dragstrip are offered on all Sundays and some special events including some holidays. This is a family friendly event where you can find racers from the age of 8 (in Junior Dragsters) to 80 in all types of cars. First time racers are welcomed and even moms can race for free on Mother's Day race - even if never raced before.\n\n\n"}

The song was released in 2005 and topped the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for seven weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks chart for four weeks in 2005.\n\nApart from \"Like a Stone\", \"Be Yourself\" is considered the band's most well-known song, and it is still played on radio stations worldwide.\n\n\"Be Yourself\" has routinely been heard in multiple media. The song is the theme music of the \"2005 Raw Diva Search\" which was held by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and it was used as the entrance music of the winner of that contest, Ashley Massaro. WWE once again used the song as one of the official theme songs to Wrestlemania XXVI. \"Be Yourself\" was also used in the \"Scrubs\" season six premiere episode \"My Mirror Image\". Along with \"Your Time Has Come\", the track also appeared in the documentary \"Warren Miller's: Higher Ground\". New York Mets outfielder Shawn Green also used the song before his at-bats at games in 2006.\n\nPrior to the vinyl release of the song, Contactmusic.com held a contest in which fans of the band could submit their pictures, over two dozen of which were selected and featured on the 7\" vinyl release of the single.\n\nThe lyrics were inspired by events from the frontman's, Chris Cornell's, own life. \"The 'be yourself' part really just came from a lot of things that I've gone through in my life and a lot of different changes and all the different tragedies and all the horrendously stupid mistakes I've made in my personal life, and wanting to be able to make up for those things and wanting to be able to not be ashamed, all that stuff,\" he explained. \"You know, that's the one thing about getting older that's better, and this song kinda says it so simply, to a degree that 10 years ago I would've been embarrassed to put it in a song 'cause it is so simple. But there it is.\"\n\nThe music video was filmed in an old hotel in downtown Los Angeles and directed by music video veteran Francis Lawrence, who has directed videos for Gwen Stefani, Aerosmith, Jennifer Lopez and Will Smith and made his feature film directorial debut with \"Constantine\". It begins with the band playing the song, a close-up of Tom Morello playing his guitar for the most part. Close-ups of Chris Cornell singing follows, along with more of Morello's guitar. The band is then shown, after the chorus, in a dark, isolated room with large windows, much like the room in their video for \"Like a Stone\". Close-ups of Morello during the guitar solo follow, with abstracted views of Cornell, while lights in the background change colors quickly. During the last chorus, lights in the background flash colors of red.\n\nCornell has said that the band modeled the concept after The Beatles' film \"Let It Be\". He said: \"If you watch \"Let It Be\", the look of the film makes the band look like it's an important happening. I just wanted to look important, like things looked when I was a child.\"\n\nThis video is much like the video for \"Like a Stone\", since the band is only shown playing in a dark room.\n\n\n\nA. \"Be Yourself\" – 4:38\nB. \"Super Stupid\" (Funkadelic cover) – 3:24\n\n"}

The facility opened in May 1993, under the name The MARK of the Quad Cities with the singer Neil Diamond as the opening act. The facility was renamed as the TaxSlayer Center on October 1, 2017.\n\nIt is the home to the revived Quad City Steamwheelers of the Indoor Football League and the Quad City Storm in the Southern Professional Hockey League.\n\nThe arena has hosted NCAA Division I college basketball games (including the Mid-Continent Conference men's basketball tournament from 1996–99) in addition to several NHL and NBA exhibition contests. The Missouri Valley Conference has hosted their Women's Basketball Tournament 2016, 2017, and 2018. The now-defunct Quad City Thunder basketball team played all their home games at the TaxSlayer Center from 1993 until the Continental Basketball Association folded eight years later.\n\nHockey has also been played at the arena since 1995. The Quad City Mallards of the United Hockey League played the first 12 years. They were replaced by the Quad City Flames of the American Hockey League for two seasons before moving to Abbotsford, British Columbia. After the Flames left, the Quad City Mallards were reincarnated in 2009 and played home games at the arena until 2018. In May 2018, two months after the Quad City Mallards ceased operations, TaxSlayer Center director Scott Mullen and former Mallards' owner Howard Cornfield announced a Southern Professional Hockey League team called the Quad City Storm would play the 2018–19 season.\n\nIn 2009, Western Illinois University's club hockey team, the Fighting Leathernecks, began playing there for four games per season. \n\nFrom 2000 to 2009, the arena played host to arena football as the home of the af2's Quad City Steamwheelers, who won the first two Arena Cup championships in league history (the arena hosted both games at the time).

{"id": "1936981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936981", "title": "Keystone Kapers", "text": "Keystone Kapers\n\nKeystone Kapers is a video game developed by Activision and published for the Atari 2600 in April 1983, and later ported to the Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, ColecoVision, and in 1984, MSX. Inspired by Mack Sennett's slapstick \"Keystone Cops\" series of silent films, the object of the game is for Officer Keystone Kelly to catch Harry Hooligan before he can escape from a department store. \"Keystone Kapers\" was written by Activision designer Garry Kitchen.\n\nThe game takes place on a side-view display of a three-story department store and its roof. The store is eight times wider than the portion in the main display, and the screen scrolls to the left or right when the player reaches the edges. Movement between the levels is accomplished by escalators located at alternating ends of the map, or an elevator in the center. A mini-map at the bottom of the screen provides and overall view of the store and the location of the players.\n\nThe player controls Officer Keystone Kelly with the joystick, which is used to run to the right or the left along a given floor. When he reaches an escalator he will be taken up to the next floor. Kelly can also use the elevator in the center of the map to move up and down, but doing so requires careful timing as it moves on its own. Kelly begins the game in the lower right on the first floor, and normally begins running to the left to reach the escalator to the second floor.\n\nHarry Hooligan starts the game in the center of the second floor. He immediately begins running to the right in an attempt to reach the elevator to the third floor. Hooligan continues moving up the floors in an attempt to reach the roof via the escalator on the left side of the third floor. If he succeeds he escapes. This trip takes 50 seconds, and a timer at the top of the screen counts down the remaining time. Kelly runs significantly faster than Hooligan and can normally catch him in that time in a straight run with no penalties.\n\nKelly can also use the elevator to get between levels. If he moves ahead of Hooligan, Hooligan will reverse direction and start back down through the store. He is aided in this by the ability to jump down between levels at either end of the map, something Kelly cannot do because the escalators only go up for Kelly. This means Kelly has to use the elevators carefully, or risk being stuck on a higher floor while the timer runs out.\n\nSlowing Kelly's progress are a number of still or moving obstacles like radios, beach balls, shopping carts and others, which he can jump over or duck under by pushing up or down on the joystick. Touching any of these objects causes a nine-second penalty. In later levels there are flying toy biplanes that will cause the player to lose a life upon contact.\n\nThe game begins with the player given three lives. One is lost every round that Hooligan remains uncaught when the timer runs out. The game proceeds through rounds until the player runs out of lives. Extra lives are awarded at every 10,000 points, up to the maximum of three.\n\nIf Kelly catches Harry, the player will score points based on the amount of time they have left. On levels 1-9, the player will score what is left on the clock multiplied by 100 points; on levels 10-15, the amount left on the clock is multiplied by 200 points, and afterwards the amount left on the clock is multiplied by 300 points. Kelly can also pick up suitcases and bags of money for 50 points each.\n\nAs with most early video games, there is no end to the game; each level gets progressively harder, adding more and/or faster hazards until Kelly loses all of his lives.\n\nPlayers who achieve a score of 35,000 or better could take a photo of the screen with the verifying score and sent it in to Activision to receive a special Billy Club patch.\n\nThe Atari 2600 version of \"Keystone Kapers\" received a Certificate of Merit in the category of \"1984 Videogame of the Year (Less than 16K ROM)\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. \"Deseret News\" gave the ColecoVision port 3 stars, praising the graphical improvement over the original.\n\nIn December 1984, \"Antic\" reviewer Ellen Keyt called out the quality of the animation in the Atari 8-bit version, writing \"The Keystone Cop's legs stretch when he jumps over a shopping cart, his uniform creases when he squats to duck a toy airplane, and he even pumps his hands up and down, waving his stick when he runs.\" She called it the \"perfect game for anyone\".\n\n"}

It is located at 105 East Orange Avenue on City Island, in the Halifax River.\n\nThe ballpark, originally known as City Island Ball Park, opened in 1914. It consisted of a baseball field and a set of wooden bleachers. The present day grandstand and press box were built in 1962. It is the home of the Daytona Tortugas and the Bethune–Cookman Wildcats. The Daytona Tortugas were founded in 1993. They have won six Florida State League championships, 1994, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2011, and 2013.\n\nThe Bethune–Cookman Wildcats have also achieved recent success, including six consecutive Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) baseball championships from 1999–2004, and seven more in 2006–2012.\n\nOne reason the stadium is named for Jackie Robinson is the fact that Daytona Beach was the first Florida city to allow Robinson to play during the 1946 season's spring training. Robinson was playing for the Triple-A Montreal Royals, who were in Florida to play an exhibition game against their parent club, the Brooklyn Dodgers. Both Jacksonville and Sanford refused to allow the game due to segregation laws. Daytona Beach permitted the game, which was played on March 17, 1946. This contributed to Robinson breaking the Major Leagues' color barrier the following year when he joined the Dodgers. The refusal by Jacksonville, previously the Dodgers' spring training home, led the team to host spring training in Daytona in 1947 and build Dodgertown in Vero Beach for the 1948 season. A statue of Robinson is now located at the south entrance to the ballpark.\n\nThe ballpark was previously the home field of the Daytona Beach Islanders (1920–24, 1936–41, 1946–66, 1977, 1985–1986), Daytona Beach Dodgers (1968–73), and Daytona Beach Astros (1978–84). The major league Montreal Expos conducted their spring training at the park from 1973–80.\n\nOn October 22, 1998, the stadium was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places. This property is part of the Daytona Beach Multiple Property Submission, a Multiple Property Submission to the National Register.\n\nThe stadium sustained heavy damage during Hurricane Donna in 1960. A $2 million historic renovation project was accelerated after Hurricane Floyd ripped off the metal roofs over the seating in 1999. In 2004, the ballpark suffered moderate damage during Hurricane Charley, causing several home games to be moved to Melching Field at Conrad Park in nearby DeLand.\n\nOn May 12, 2018, the stadium hosted a concert by rapper Nelly with Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and Juvenile as the opening acts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1937038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937038", "title": "K-complex", "text": "K-complex\n\nA K-complex is a waveform that may be seen on an electroencephalogram (EEG). It occurs during stage 2 of NREM sleep. It is the \"largest event in healthy human EEG\". They are more frequent in the first sleep cycles.\n\nK-complexes have two proposed functions: first, suppressing cortical arousal in response to stimuli that the sleeping brain evaluates not to signal danger, and second, aiding sleep-based memory consolidation.\n\nThe K-complex was discovered in 1937 in the private laboratories of Alfred Lee Loomis.\n\nK-complex consists of a brief negative high-voltage peak, usually greater than 100 µV, followed by a slower positive complex around 350 and 550 ms and at 900 ms a final negative peak. K-complexes occur roughly every 1.0–1.7 minutes and are often followed by bursts of sleep spindles. They occur spontaneously but also occur in response to external stimuli such as sounds, touches on the skin and internal ones such as inspiratory interruptions. They are generated in widespread cortical locations though they tend to predominate over the frontal parts of the brain.\n\nBoth K-complex and delta wave activity in stage 2 sleep create slow-wave (0.8 Hz) and delta (1.6–4.0 Hz) oscillations. However, their topographical distribution is different, and the delta power of K-complexes is higher.\n\nThey are created by the occurrence in widespread cortical areas of outward dendritic currents from the middle (III) to the upper (I) layers of the cerebral cortex. This is accompanied by a decrease in broadband EEG power including gamma wave activity. This produces \"down-states\" of neuronal silence in which neural network activity is reduced. The activity of K-complexes is transferred to the thalamus where it synchronizes the thalamocortical network during sleep, producing sleep oscillations such as spindles and delta waves. It has been observed that they are indeed identical in the \"laminar distributions of transmembrane currents\" to the slow waves of slow-wave sleep.\n\nK-complexes have been suggested both to protect sleep and also to engage in information processing, as they are both an essential part of the synchronization of NREM sleep, while they also respond to both internal and external stimuli in a reactive manner. This would be consistent with a function in suppressing cortical arousal in response to stimuli that the brain needs to initially process in regard to whether it is dangerous or not.\n\nAnother suggested function is aiding the activation homeostasis of synapses and memory consolidation. The activation thresholds of cortical synapses become lowered during wakefulness as they process information, making them more responsive, and so need to be adjusted back to preserve their signal-to-noise ratio. The down-state provided by K-complexes does this by reducing the strengths of synaptic connections that occur while an individual is awake. Further, the recovery from the down-state they induce allows that \"cortical firing 'reboots' in a systematic order\" so that memory engrams encoded during neuronal firing can be \"repeatedly practiced and thus consolidated\".\n\nThey are present in the sleep of 5-month-old infants, and develop with age. Between 3 and 5 years of age a faster negative component appears and continues to increase until adolescence. Another change occurs in adults: before 30 years of age their frequency and amplitude is higher than in older people particularly those over 50 years of age. This parallels the decrease in other components of sleep such as sleep spindle density and delta power.\n\nIn individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, K-complex induced synchronization can trigger spike-and-wave discharges. This tends to happen most between the shift between waking and NREM, and between NREM and REM sleep. In autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, K-complexes are almost invariably present at the start of seizures.\n\nIndividuals with restless legs syndrome have increased numbers of K-complexes and these are associated with (and often precede) leg movements. Dopamine enhancing drugs such as L-DOPA that reduce leg movements do not reduce the K-complex suggesting that they are primary and the leg movements secondary to them. Failure of such drugs to reduce K-complexes in spite of reducing the leg movements has been suggested to be why patients after such treatment still continue to complain of non-restorative sleep. Clonazepam is another treatment for RLS; like other benzodiazepines, it inhibits REM sleep by enhancing levels of GABA. This inhibition of REM sleep significantly decreases K-complex count, and unlike L-DOPA treatment, clonazepam studies report improvement in sleep restoration. Therefore, drugs that inhibit REM sleep also decrease K-complex count.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with inspiratory occlusions evoking fewer K-complexes during NREM sleep even though K-complexes are evoked normally to auditory stimuli and such individuals react normally to respiratory interruptions when awake. This suggests a link between such sleep apnea and a sleep specific blunted cortical response to respiratory problems.\n"}

{"id": "1937048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937048", "title": "Catholic unionist", "text": "Catholic unionist\n\nCatholic Unionist is a term historically used for a Catholic in Ireland who supported the Union which formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and subsequently used to describe Catholics who support the Union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nThe term \"Catholic unionist\" has become controversial since the start of the 1970-1998 Troubles, due to the strong association of Irish Unionism with Protestantism. The most recent surveys suggest that, although a plurality of Catholics in Northern Ireland are technically unionists in that they support Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom, very few would self-identify as \"unionist\" or support an explicitly unionist political party. This has led to the nickname unicorns for self-identified Catholic unionists, by analogy with a non-existent creature. They can be contrasted with Protestant nationalists, who supported separation from Great Britain.\n\nRoman Catholic support for the Kingdom of Ireland (1542-1800) had the full backing of the Holy See from 1555, with the papal bull \"\" issued by Pope Paul IV during the reign of Queen Mary. Unfortunately only one monarch after her, had been Catholic, James II (1685-89), who called the Parliament of 1689. The kingdom had mainstream support from Jacobites, in hopes that eventually a Catholic monarchy would reign. In general, the Holy See had better relations with Europe's monarchies, particularly Spain, Austria, 1700s France and Portugal, and was seen as a conservative force. The Irish Catholic Hierarchy, and notably Archbishop Troy, supported the passage of the Acts of Union 1800, expecting that Catholic MPs would be elected, but this was delayed by three decades.\n\nHistorically, after the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great number of Irish Catholics such as Thomas O'Hagan served in senior positions in the British Empire of the 19th century, and many of the Irish nobility and landed gentry had remained Catholic or had converted to Catholicism in the 1800s. \n\nAmong these were: \n\nIrish Catholic unionists were a political minority group without their own representation in the House of Commons. They tended to support the Irish Loyal and Patriotic Union and subsequent Irish Unionist Alliance. As the electorate expanded after the Representation of the People Act 1884, the influence of the grander Catholics inevitably declined. \n\nIrish Catholic unionists petitioned against the Government of Ireland Bill 1893 on the grounds that it would create a \"revolutionary spirit disastrous to the true interests\" of Catholicism. Whilst sympathetic to Ulster's resistance during the Home Rule Crisis they were not averse to devolution, and some would have preferred a home-ruled united Ireland within the United Kingdom. \n\nFor many Catholic officials and lawyers, loyalty to the British system depended on the prevailing political climate. It might be essential for their careers and then dropped; an example being George Gavan Duffy. John O'Connor KC started his political life as a Fenian activist and later became an MP and King's Counsel. Other such as General Bulfin and Antony MacDonnell chose to remain loyal. \n\nFrom the success of Sinn Fein at the 1918 election, Irish Catholic Unionists were constantly physically attacked and threatened by republicans for their loyalism, as the Irish poet Edward Dowden would note: \"The free expression of opinion by Catholics is checked by a system of intimidation and terrorism\". The most notable murder was in June 1922, when a local magistrate James Woulfe-Flanagan was shot dead in front of his family while leaving Mass at Newry Cathedral.\n\nThe Holy See itself was cautious in 1916-22 and would not recognise the revolutionary Irish Republic of 1919-22. Once agreement had been reached on the establishment of the Irish Free State, Monsignor Luzio was sent to interview the 26 Irish bishops, describing them on his return as \"26 Popes\". The British diplomat to the Vatican at the time was John Francis Charles, 7th Count de Salis-Soglio, who owned large landed estates in Limerick and Armagh. \n\nFrom the 1920s a number have served as useful cultural and political bridges between Dublin and London, such as Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford (1905-2001). \n\nOn the partition of Ireland in 1921-22 several former Catholic Unionists were appointed to the first Irish Free State Senate.\n\n\nMany prominent members of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland have been Catholics, including the majority of its past leaders (such as John Cushnahan, Oliver Napier and Seán Neeson), some of its Deputy Leaders (such as Seamus Close and Eileen Bell), former MP (of the Northern Ireland Parliament) Thomas Columba Gormley, as well as three of its seven current Assembly members. The Alliance Party is not, as such, a Unionist party, as its support for the Union is based purely on that being the wishes of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.\n\n\nCatholic supporters of the Ulster Unionist Party - the dominant political force in Northern Ireland until the 1970s - tended to support the reformist Prime Minister Terence O'Neill against the emerging hardline Protestant Unionist Party (later the DUP). The UUP later took a more hardline turn itself, and as of 2016 support for either party among Catholics is almost zero. Catholic supporters of the Union today may vote for the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party (notwithstanding the SDLP's support for a united Ireland), or for the non-partisan Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, or for none of the major parties.\n\nNorthern Ireland Life and Times Survey's 2014 poll results suggest that half of Northern Irish Catholics favour Northern Ireland remaining as part of the United Kingdom. The NILT results also suggest that 6% of Catholics would vote for the nominally unionist Alliance Party, but that only 1% would support any of the mainstream or 'hardline' Unionist parties. Similarly, the poll results suggested that 7% of Protestants would vote for the Alliance Party, while 1% of Protestants would vote for the moderate nationalist SDLP.\n\nA 2011 survey by the Northern Ireland Life and Times survey found that 52% of Northern Irish Catholics respondents favoured Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom over a united Ireland.\n\n"}

Despite being a minor grape, in the late 20th century it was the third most widely planted grape variety in the Loir-et-Cher \"département\" which includes the winemaking areas of Cheverny, Cour-Cheverny, Montrichard, Oisly, Saint-Romain-sur-Cher, Valençay as well as vineyards that make wines under the Touraine AOC, Cremant de Loire AOC and \"Vin de Pays du Loir et Cher\". By 2004 acreage had steadily declined to around 750 acres (300 hectares). It is still a permitted grape variety in the \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC) regions of Cheverny AOC, Valençay AOC and Vouvray AOC.\n\nAmpelographers are not completely sure about Arbois' origins though some of the grape's synonyms seem to suggest a relationship with the Pinot family, as does its weak association with the Jura wine region of Arbois AOC (mostly through its similarities in leaf structure with Savagnin). It is most likely that the grape is native to the Loire Valley. Most of the grape's viticultural history is tied into the historic Touraine region where it is still most prevalent today, particularly in the Loir-et-Cher \"département\". The grape is on the decline in plantings and importance though it is still a permitted grape variety in several AOCs including being the only grape other than Chenin blanc permitted in Vouvray.\n\nThe Arbois grapevine is highly vigorous and prone to producing high yields. If the yields are not kept in check, the white wines produced from the grapes can be less refined in flavor. Compared to the Chenin blanc grape that is found throughout the Loire, Arbois tends to produce softer wines with less noticeable acidity. For this reason, Arbois has mostly been valued as a \"softening\" agent to the higher acid varieties of Chenin blanc, Savagnin and Romorantin.\n\nAmong the synonyms that Arbois is known under throughout France are Menu Pineau and Petit Pineau. Other synonyms include Herbois, Orbois and Verdet.\n"}

The character continued in \"Thrilling Comics\" until issue #64 (Feb 1948). He also appeared in \"America's Best Comics\" #1-23 and 27.\n\nCirca 2000, the character was revived and renamed 'Tom Strange' in \"Tom Strong\" #11 (published by America's Best Comics).\n\nHugo Strange (\"Dr. Strange,\" later \"Doc Strange\") is an American scientist who develops a serum called Alosun — described as a \"distillate of sun atoms\" — which when ingested gives him superhuman strength, the ability to fly, and invulnerability. Doc Strange is assisted by his girlfriend Virginia Thompson. In \"Thrilling Comics\" #24, he gains a teen sidekick, wealthy young wastrel Mike Ellis, who wears a costume identical to Strange's, along with a green cape. Though non-powered during the earlier adventures, Mike later gains the same powers as Doc Strange.\n\nThe character's name was \"Doctor Strange\" at first; his moniker changed to \"Doc Strange\" in issue #11 (Dec 1940).\n\nAccording to \"Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes\", they \"confront villains like the Faceless Phantom (and his \"delta ray gun\"), the Yellow Peril Emperor (and his flame apes), and the black magic-empowered Mephisto.\n\nDoc Strange was briefly revived in the pages of \"Femforce\" as part of the Vault Heroes, a group of Golden Age superheroes who volunteered to have themselves cryogenically frozen following World War II, so that they could be revived should the world need them. He died shortly after being unfrozen, making the heroes realize that the cryogenic process did not work perfectly on everyone.\n\nAC Comics went on to reprint many of his Golden Age adventures in various anthologies.\n\nDoc Strange, along with other heroes from Nedor Comics, were revived by Alan Moore in his series \"Tom Strong\". This revival set the characters on a parallel world called Terra Obscura, which was also the title of the resulting mini-series. The character was renamed \"Thomas Hugo Strange\" (or \"Tom Strange\"), presumably to set him apart from the Marvel Comics sorcerer Doctor Strange and Batman villain Hugo Strange, and to present him as a Terra Obscura version of Tom Strong.\n\nIn \"Tom Strong\" #11, Moore and co-creator Chris Sprouse more fully introduce the idea of Terra Obscura being a parallel Earth, \"but in our own dimension. In our own galaxy\". Tom Strong himself had found it while traveling space alone. He theorizes that the duplicate Earth (and duplicate solar system) \"must be due to some near-inconceivable fluke of mathematics, of statistical probability\".\n\nIn this issue, Tom Strange is revealed to have run across the Milky Way for 30 years to reach Strong for help in stopping an alien menace which killed or imprisoned most of the science-heroes of Terra Obscura. It is judged Strange had set off on his task soon after Tom had left. The stress of leaping from world to world temporarily drives Strange mad. He battles Tom before being subdued and sleeping--dreamlessly--for a fortnight. Once he awakens, he is of a much calmer mind. The two set off back home in Tom's new ship, Tom shows Strange an array of comic books, produced on his earth, which matches the history and events on Strange's Earth.\nTom helps Strange revive his surviving allies, most of whom have been trapped in time by the alien menace for the thirty years, unaware and unaging. With the contents of a lab hidden deep in the inverted city of 'Invertica', the assembled superheroes manage to neutralize the alien menace.\n\nHe is described by Strong as the most powerful being he's ever met, and in a different league from Strong entirely.\n\nHe operates with the modern incarnation of SMASH.\n\nIn 2013, he appeared in limited series \"Tom Strong and the Planet of Peril\" by Vertigo.\n\nDoc Strange appears in the webcomic Heroes,inc. along with a Golden Age Captain Future and Blue Beetle to save Diana Masters (Miss Masque) from an attack by futuristic soldiers. It's revealed in flashbacks that he is one of the scientists that were part of creating the original Golden Age heroes of World War II, under the direction of Archibald Masters (American Crusader). He developed a chemical called Alosun for the superhero project, but inspired by the heroes that they were creating, he tried it on himself first.\n\nTom Strange is capable of flight (or at least vast Golden Age Superman-like leaps), superhuman strength, and surviving indefinitely in the vacuum of space (without air or water), and has invulnerability to re-entry, extreme impacts (falling to Earth from space) and bullets. He is also a brilliant scientist.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1937077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937077", "title": "Sleep spindle", "text": "Sleep spindle\n\nSleep spindles are bursts of neural oscillatory activity that are generated by interplay of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and other thalamic nuclei during stage 2 NREM sleep in a frequency range of ~11 to 16 Hz (usually 12–14 Hz) with a duration of 0.5 seconds or greater (usually 0.5–1.5 seconds). After generation in the TRN, spindles are sustained and relayed to the cortex by thalamo-thalamic and thalamo-cortical feedback loops regulated by both GABAergic and NMDA-receptor mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission. Sleep spindles have been found in all tested mammalian species and in vitro cells.\n\nResearch supports that spindles (sometimes referred to as \"sigma bands\" or \"sigma waves\") play an essential role in both sensory processing and long term memory consolidation. Until recently, it was believed that each sleep spindle oscillation peaked at the same time throughout the neocortex. It was determined that oscillations sweep across the neocortex in circular patterns around the neocortex, peaking in one area, and then a few milliseconds later in an adjacent area. It has been suggested that this spindle organization allows for neurons to communicate across cortices. The time scale at which the waves travel at is the same speed it takes for neurons to communicate with each other.\n\nAlthough the function of sleep spindles is unclear, it is believed that they actively participate in the consolidation of overnight declarative memory through the reconsolidation process. The density of spindles has been shown to increase after extensive learning of declarative memory tasks and the degree of increase in stage 2 spindle activity correlates with memory performance.\nAmong other functions, spindles facilitate somatosensory development, thalamocortical sensory gating, synaptic plasticity, and offline memory consolidation. Sleep spindles closely modulate interactions between the brain and its external environment; they essentially moderate responsiveness to sensory stimuli during sleep. Recent research has revealed that spindles distort the transmission of auditory information to the cortex; spindles isolate the brain from external disturbances during sleep. Another study found that re-exposure to olfactory cues during sleep initiate reactivation, an essential part of long term memory consolidation that improves later recall performance. Spindles generated in the thalamus have been shown to aid sleeping in the presence of disruptive external sounds. A correlation has been found between the amount of brainwave activity in the thalamus and a sleeper's ability to maintain tranquility. Spindles play an essential role in both sensory processing and long term memory consolidation because they are generated in the TRN.\n\nDuring sleep, these spindles are seen in the brain as a burst of activity immediately following muscle twitching. Researchers think the brain, particularly in the young, is learning about what nerves control what specific muscles when asleep.\n\nSleep spindle activity has furthermore been found to be associated with the integration of new information into existing knowledge as well as directed remembering and forgetting (fast sleep spindles).\n\nDuring NREM sleep, the brain waves produced by people with schizophrenia lack the normal pattern of slow and fast spindles. Loss of sleep spindles are also a feature of familial fatal insomnia, a prion disease. Changes in spindle density are observed in disorders such as epilepsy and autism.\n\nSleep spindles play a crucial role in declarative memory consolidation, however, most studies neglect to control for sex , although both sex and menstruation affect sleep and online learning periods. Studies have shown that the influence of sleep spindles during the declarative memory process may be affected by modulatory menstrual cycle effects in females. These findings have contributed to a proposed waxing and waning effect of estrogen on the memory performance of women due to fluctuating estrogen levels, which could potentially predict a decrease in memory performance during menses. Because of the novelty of these studies, the waxing and waning effect has been overlooked in every prior study .\n\nWomen tend to have 0.16 more sleep spindles per minute than men ( ⁠i.e. roughly 9–⁠10 more over an hour's time). A female advantage has been found for episodic, emotional, and spatial memories as well as recognition of odours, faces, and pictures. These differences are believed to be due to hormonal influence, especially that of estrogen. The female sex hormone estrogen primarily influences sexual maturation and reproduction, but has also been found to facilitate other brain functions, including cognition and memory. On verbal tasks where women scored higher than men, women scored higher during the mid-luteal phase, when women have higher estrogen levels, when compared to the menstrual phase. A recent study found that local brain estrogen production within cognitive circuits may be important for the acquisition and consolidation of memories.\nRecent experiments concerning the relationship between estrogen and the process of offline memory consolidation have also focused on sleep spindles. Genzel and colleagues determined that there was a menstrual effect on declarative and motor performance, meaning that women in the mid-luteal phase (high estrogen) performed higher than the other female participants. Women in the luteal phase were also the only participants to experience an increase in spindles after learning, which led to the conclusion that the effect of the menstrual cycle may be mediated by spindles and female hormones.\n"}

It was sponsored by the Confederate Memorial Association, which formally dedicated the monument on September 26, 1867. The town of Romney has claimed that this is the first memorial structure erected to memorialize the Confederate dead in the United States and that the town performed the nation's first public decoration of Confederate graves on June 1, 1866.\n\nThe idea to memorialize the Confederate war dead of Hampshire County was first discussed in the spring of 1866. Following the decoration of the graves that summer, the Confederate Memorial Association engaged in fundraising for construction of the memorial, and by 1867 the necessary funds were raised. The inscription \"The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights\" was selected, and the contract for the memorial's construction was awarded to the Gaddes Brothers firm of Baltimore. The memorial's components were delivered to Indian Mound Cemetery on September 14, 1867, and the memorial was dedicated on September 26 of that year. The construction of the Confederate Memorial marked the beginning of an era of post-war revitalization for Hampshire County following the American Civil War.\n\nThe memorial comprises a base with obelisk and capstone, standing on a raised mound. The list of 125 names engraved on the monument includes four captains, seven lieutenants (one of which was a chaplain), three sergeants, and 119 privates. The memorial underwent a restoration in 1984, and is decorated annually with a handmade evergreen garland and wreath on Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day.\n\nThe idea to memorialize the men of Hampshire County who had died fighting in the Military of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War was first discussed at a meeting in early spring of 1866 at the Romney residence of former Confederate Colonel Robert White. In addition to White, those present at the meeting included his brother Christian Streit White, his future sister-in-law Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Jane Schultze, and his sister Frances Ann White, who later married Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy.\n\nFollowing the meeting, the concept gained support among other residents of Romney. Later in the spring of 1866, a group of Hampshire County women held a public meeting to organize the Confederate Memorial Association with the mission of honoring the men who had died fighting for the Confederacy and providing financial aid to their families. At this meeting, the association appointed officers, adopted a constitution, and organized committees to arrange for the decoration of Confederate interments.\n\nThe people of Hampshire County had been overwhelmingly pro-Confederate during the American Civil War, but the county now lay within Unionist West Virginia. West Virginia's first state constitution disenfranchised Confederate veterans and partisans and forbade them from holding elected office. In spite of these impediments and risking the ire of Unionist authorities, members of the Confederate Memorial Association and their families marched through Romney to Indian Mound Cemetery and formally decorated the gravestones at the interment sites of Confederate dead on June 1, 1866. Few Hampshire County residents participated in this first decoration of the Confederate graves, fearing reproach from Federal authorities; some who had pledged to take part in the decoration later refused to do so for the same reason.\n\nThis adornment in Indian Mound Cemetery has been called the first such public decoration of Confederate burials, but the claim is disputed by other towns in the Southern United States. Romney's decoration contributed to a precedent that spread throughout the South during the Reconstruction Era. Relatives and loved ones of the Union dead buried in Indian Mound Cemetery also began to follow this precedent by decorating the cemetery's Union headstones.\n\nFollowing the first decoration of the graves in 1866, momentum built for the erection of a permanent monument to the Confederate dead at Indian Mound Cemetery. The Confederate Memorial Association engaged in fundraising for construction of the memorial, including sewing circles, bazaars, and fairs. Confederate veterans and others in Hampshire County undertook additional fundraising efforts, including entertainment shows and general solicitation. In addition to raising funds for the construction of the memorial, the Confederate Memorial Association also raised money for the widows and children of the Confederate dead. By October 15, 1866, the gross receipts returned to the association's treasury amounted to $1,170.91 USD, of which the Confederate Memorial Association provided US$421.58 to the Confederate widows and orphaned children. Fundraising continued until June 1867.\n\nBy June 6, 1867, the Confederate Memorial Association had raised the necessary funds and proceeded to select the design, inviting and considering the opinions of Confederate veterans and others across Hampshire County.\n\nIn July 1867, a committee of the Confederate Memorial Association narrowed the numerous proposals it had received for the memorial's inscription to three finalists. The first inscription finalist said the Confederate soldiers \"died in defense of what they believed to be right\", the second said they were \"our sons and brothers, who fell as soldiers in the Confederate army\", and the third, which was ultimately adopted by the committee, read in full: \"The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights\".\n\nOnce the design and inscription had been chosen, the association appointed committees to select a contractor. At the end of the process, the contract was awarded to the Gaddes Brothers firm of Baltimore. They were asked to fabricate a white Italian marble monument. The memorial was designed, sculpted, and manufactured at a cost of US$1,133.63. According to United Daughters of the Confederacy historian Mary Bell Foote, the words \"Southern Rights\" were initially omitted from the end of the memorial's inscription during its fabrication due to the \"bitter feelings at the time\" following the American Civil War, and Federal statutes banning such monuments. After the memorial's components were packaged for shipping to Romney, the words \"Southern Rights\" were secretly etched into the white marble and the components quickly boarded over and shipped.\n\nThe memorial's components were delivered to Indian Mound Cemetery on September 14, 1867, and it was erected at its present location by a group of Romney volunteers. Bob Fisher was paid US$5.00 for raising the earthen mound around the monument's location and US$4.11 for providing lodging to one of the Gaddes brothers at his residence. William Sheetz was paid US$18.80 for building the memorial's raised mound and supporting foundation. Twelve days later on September 26, the Confederate Memorial was formally dedicated in a public ceremony.\n\nThe Confederate Memorial stands upon a raised mound ringed by five boxwoods within the original section of Indian Mound Cemetery, not far from the cemetery's entrance. Several family interment plots surround the memorial and its circular raised lawn. A burial ground where Confederate and Union dead were buried during the American Civil War lies adjacent to the memorial.\n\nThe Confederate Memorial is in the form of an obelisk, measuring at its base and in height. The structure's pedestal consists of two major stylized blocks of white marble, topped by a sculpture of a cloth draped urn. Carved into the façade of the smaller top block of the memorial is a high relief that represents either Fame or an angel placing a laurel wreath upon the head of a dying soldier clasping his sword. Below, on the façade of the larger block, is the inscription: \"The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights.\" The other three sides of the memorial contain the engraved names of 125 Hampshire County men who died for the Confederate cause. A number representing the total fallen Confederates was not included in the memorial as it was not precisely known at the time of the monument's construction. The memorial's foundation block bears the date of its erection, \"1867\".\n\nThe list of 125 names engraved on the monument consists of four captains, seven lieutenants (one of which was a chaplain), three sergeants, and 119 privates. Since the memorial's erection in 1867, several names of Hampshire County's Confederate dead were found to have been omitted from the memorial. These names have been included in the \"Confederate Honor Roll\" along with those names etched in the memorial and the names of Confederate veterans. Each of these names is recited during the annual ceremony held on Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day. The following is the list of Confederate dead etched into the Confederate Memorial:\n\nIn 1984, the Confederate Memorial underwent an extensive restoration. The monument had darkened due to weathering. The surfaces of the memorial were sanded and sealed for future protection. This restoration effort was funded through charitable contributions. The names of the contributors were inscribed within the same treasurer's book used to record the memorial's inaugural contributions on June 6, 1866. The monument's restoration cost totaled US$2,850.\n\nThe tradition of decorating the Confederate graves in Indian Mound Cemetery has continued annually since June 1, 1866, and occurs on the first Saturday in June, which is known as Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day or June Decoration Day. On this day, participants in the ceremony march down Main Street (U.S. Route 50) through Romney with American Civil War reenactors carrying Confederate flags. A handmade evergreen garland measuring in length is suspended from the Confederate Memorial, along with evergreen wreaths. Flowers and Confederate flags are also placed at each of the Confederate headstones. The decorations are usually placed at the memorial and upon the Confederate gravestones by reenactors. Invited speakers address participants. A roll of honor is recited at the memorial, followed by a musket salute. Ceremony participants include descendants of the founding members of the Confederate Memorial Association.\n\nThe construction of the Confederate Memorial marked the beginning of an era of post-war revitalization for Hampshire County following the American Civil War. The memorial became a symbol of the county's restored confidence. The citizens of Hampshire County worked together to reestablish and rebuild the institutions, municipal buildings, and businesses destroyed during the war. The Confederate Memorial Association that constructed the monument was a part of a larger movement throughout the post-war American South, especially in Virginia, which sought to provide suitable interments for Confederate war dead. Historian Caroline E. Janney averred that these \"Ladies' Memorial Associations\" used \"gender in the interest of Confederate politics\", which laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy belief.\n\nThe memorial is among the first monuments erected to memorialize the Confederate dead in the United States. Romney's claim to have the first Confederate Memorial is disputed by Cheraw, South Carolina, as its monument was dedicated two months prior on July 26, 1867. However, the Cheraw memorial omits the mention of \"Confederacy\", \"Confederate\", or \"Southern\".\n\nAs part of the 2–4 June 2017 observance of Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day and the 150th anniversary of the Confederate Memorial's construction, participants installed a tombstone, a Cross of Honor, and Confederate flags at the gravesite of African-American Alfred Whiting in nearby African-American Mount Pisgah Benevolence Cemetery. In addition, participants performed a ceremony and presentation on Whiting's Confederate service at his gravesite. However, Whiting's status as a Confederate veteran is a matter of debate among local historians. In August 2017, public debate over Confederate monuments and memorials was exacerbated by the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. While this debate was centered around the placement of Confederate monuments in public spaces, the Confederate Memorial in Romney is located on private land owned by the Indian Mound Cemetery Association Board of Directors.\n\nBetween 16 and 17 September 2017, the Confederate Memorial was vandalized. The unknown perpetrators spray painted black graffiti on the monument and removed Confederate flags previously emplaced nearby the monument. Papers with vulgar language were also left behind by the perpetrators. Following the vandalism, the damaged parts of the monument were covered with cardboard and tape.\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nCitations\n\n\n"}

The OLCC was created by an act of the Oregon Legislative Assembly in 1933, days after the repeal of prohibition, as a means of providing control over the distribution, sales and consumption of alcoholic beverages. To this end, the agency was given the authority to regulate and license those who manufacture, sell or serve alcohol. Oregon is one of 18 alcoholic beverage control states that directly control the sales of alcoholic beverages in the United States. In 2014, the passage of Oregon Ballot Measure 91 (2014) legalized the recreational use of marijuana in Oregon and gave regulatory authority to the OLCC.\n\nAlcohol Prohibition in the United States began in 1919 with the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment. In the early 1930s, Oregon Governor Julius Meier appointed a committee, led by Dr. William S. Knox, to study Oregon's options regarding the regulation of alcoholic beverages in the state. In what came to be known as the Knox Report, the committee recommended a system similar to Canada's.\n\nBased on the recommendations in the Knox Report, the Oregon Legislative Assembly held a special session that created the Oregon Liquor Control Commission in 1933, just days after the national repeal of prohibition. Governor Meier signed the Liquor Control Act (also known as the Knox Act) on December 15, 1933. The act gave the state exclusive rights to sell distilled spirits and fortified wine as well as the authority to license private businesses to sell beer and wine by the bottle or glass.\n\nMarijuana Prohibition in the State of Oregon began in 1935 with the passage of the Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act. Possession of small amounts of marijuana was decriminalized in Oregon in 1973. In 1998, the state passed the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act, allowing residents to obtain a Medical Marijuana Patient card and grow or obtain marijuana for personal use for medical purposes. Under that act, patients are allowed to designate caregivers, which allowed for the growth of the Oregon medical marijuana dispensary program. The passage of Measure 91 in 2014 legalized possession of marijuana for recreational personal use and created a regulatory licensing and enforcement structure for commercial sales of marijuana. This bill also legalized the growing of personal marijuana plants at a household, which was unique among the three states which had legalized marijuana at the time (Oregon, Washington, and Colorado.) In 2015, Oregon State Governor Kate Brown signed an emergency bill allowing medical marijuana dispensaries to sell small amounts of marijuana to recreational customers in order provide a legal source of marijuana for recreational purposes while additional statutes and administrative rules were put into place for the recreational marijuana program. This \"Early Retail Sales\" bill allowed these sales to continue until December 31, 2016. After that time, medical dispensaries were no longer allowed to sell to recreational customers.\n\nOn April 27, 2006, Teresa Kaiser, the director of the commission at that time, resigned after being charged with driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.16, twice the legal limit in Oregon. The arrest was widely reported in mass media after the incident occurred. Following the arrest and resignation, the OLCC board held an emergency meeting to appoint an interim acting executive director.\n\nToday, Oregon's alcohol regulation program has three major operational programs; the Distilled Spirits Program, the Recreational Marijuana Program, and the Public Safety Program. All three programs are supported by the Administration, Financial Services, and Support Services divisions.\n\nThe Distilled Spirits Program oversees the distribution and sale of distilled spirits in the state. The Distilled Spirits division centrally purchases, warehouses and distributes distilled spirits to Oregon's independently operated liquor stores. OLCC's Public Safety Program licenses and regulates businesses in the alcohol industry such as manufacturers, wholesalers, bars, restaurants, grocery and convenience stores.\n\nThe Recreational Marijuana Program is exclusively authorized to make recreational marijuana available to consumers and licensed businesses through retail marijuana stores. The program also tracks the growing, transporting, processing and selling of recreational marijuana products.\n\nThe Public Safety Program is responsible for licensing and regulating the operation of the liquor and recreational marijuana industry in Oregon.\n\nThe OLCC has five regional offices housing aspects of each program. The Portland or \"Metro region\" office is located in Milwaukie, Oregon (a suburb of Portland) and also operates as the Headquarters for the agency. The remaining regional offices are located in Medford, Salem, Bend, and Eugene. In addition to these regional offices, the agency staffs a number of satellite offices for intake of liquor applications and to house operations for the agency's field inspectors, who report to regional managers at each of their parent regional offices.\n\nA seven-member board of commissioners meets monthly to set OLCC policy and make decisions in areas such as liquor licenses, rules, contested case hearings and appointments of liquor store agents. The governor appoints and the Senate confirms these commissioners for four-year terms. Each commissioner represents a congressional district. A minimum of one seat on the Commission is must be reserved for a representative of the restaurant and hospitality industry.\n\n\nORS 471.775 Regulatory specialists have authority as provided under this chapter, ORS chapter 153, ORS 133.005 to 133.400, 133.450, 133.525 to 133.703, 133.721 to 133.739, 161.235, 161.239 and 161.245 and chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971, to conduct inspections or investigations, make arrests and seizures, aid in prosecutions for offenses, issue criminal citations and citations for violations and otherwise enforce this chapter, ORS 474.005 to 474.095 and 474.115, commission rules and any other laws of this state that the commission considers related to alcoholic liquor, including but not limited to laws regarding the manufacture, importation, transportation, possession, distribution, sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, the manufacture or use of false identification or the entry of premises licensed to sell alcoholic liquor.\n\nORS 475B.285 An Oregon Liquor Control Commission regulatory specialist has the authority as provided in ORS 133.005 to 133.400, 133.450, 133.525 to 133.703, 133.721 to 133.739, 161.235, 161.245 and 475B.010 to 475B.395, ORS chapter 153 and chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971, to conduct inspections and investigations, make seizures, aid in prosecutions for offenses, issue citations for violations and otherwise enforce the provisions of ORS 475B.010 to 475B.395, any rule adopted under ORS 475B.010 to 475B.395 and any other law of this state that charges the commission with a duty, function or power related to marijuana, including enforcing any provision of a law or rule related to individuals who use false identification for purposes of purchasing or possessing a marijuana item or who engage in illegal activity on or near a licensed premises.\n\nUnder state statute, the regulatory specialists (inspectors) of the OLCC whether enforcing marijuana or liquor regulations, are considered peace officers when exercising authority over liquor or marijuana related activities and business. This classification includes police officers and officers of the state's Criminal Justice Division.

Protocols should allow for the addition of new codes for existing fields in future versions of protocols by accepting messages with unknown codes (possibly logging them). Programmers should avoid sending messages with \"legal but obscure protocol features\" that might expose deficiencies in receivers, and design their code \"not just to survive other misbehaving hosts, but also to cooperate to limit the amount of disruption such hosts can cause to the shared communication facility\".\n\nIn 2001, Marshall Rose characterized several deployment problems when applying Postel's principle in the design of a new application protocol. For example, a defective implementation that sends non-conforming messages might be used only with implementations that tolerate those deviations from the specification until, possibly several years later, it is connected with a less tolerant application that rejects its messages.

It is a fluxional molecule in which the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) fluorine atoms interchange positions by the Berry pseudorotation mechanism. \n\nPhosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus pentabromide, and phosphorus heptabromide are ionic in the solid and liquid states; PCl is formulated as PClPCl, but in contrast, PBr is formulated as PBr Br, and PBr is formulated as PBr Br. They are widely used as chlorinating and brominating agents in organic chemistry.\n\nThe phosphorus(III) halides are the best known of the three series. They are usually prepared by direct reaction of the elements, or by transhalogenation.\n\nPhosphorus trifluoride is used as a ligand in coordination chemistry, where it resembles carbon monoxide. Phosphorus trichloride is a major industrial chemical and widely used starting material for phosphorus chemistry. Phosphorus tribromide is used in organic chemistry to convert alcohols to alkyl bromides and carboxylic acids to acyl bromides (\"e.g.\" in the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction).

The young Jesus and the Holy Family have just left Egypt after hearing of the death of King Herod.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:22\n\nUpon Herod's death his kingdom was divided in three. Judea went to his son Archelaus, who was as great a tyrant as his father. Most notably he killed some 3000 rebels soon after ascending the throne. His cruelty aroused such popular anger that in 6 AD Archelaus was deposed by the Romans in response to complaints from his subjects. As a result, the Romans began directly appointing a governor for the area, with Pontius Pilate being a notable example. The concern Joseph expresses in this verse thus fits with what is known from the history of the period. The decision to go to Galilee was also a reasonable one. That region was ruled by Herod's far more even-tempered son Herod Antipas and there is evidence that the region had become a refuge to others fleeing the rule of Archelaus or the Romans.\n\nOne incongruity is that the word translated as \"reign\", more precisely means \"reign as a king.\" This is incorrect, unlike his father Archelaus was only an ethnarch, not a king. Most scholars, even evangelical ones, are content to accept this as the author of Matthew simply being imprecise. There have also been several attempts to explain the discrepancy. Jones notes that Augustus' decision that Archelaus would only be granted the title of ethnarch occurred six months into his reign. Jones thus thinks it possible that during these first months Archelaus did call himself king, and it would have been during this period that Joseph returned from Egypt.\n\nJoseph is again given important information in a dream. However, this time the author of Matthew does not report on its origin. The vocabulary of the passage and the previous instances make most scholars accept this to be another message from God.\n\nThe Gospel of Luke mentions none of this. Most scholars believe this is because Luke sees Nazareth as Joseph's original home, and thus sees no reason to explain why he returns there. Much time is spent explaining why the family was in Bethlehem at the time of Jesus' birth. Matthew has the opposite view seeing Bethlehem as the family's original home, as demonstrated by them having a house in . It thus needs to go into some detail explaining why they eventually move to Nazareth. The important word is that translated as \"withdrew\" in the WEB. Gundry notes that the author of Matthew would have used return if Nazareth was Joseph's original home and \"withdrawing\" implies leaving for a new location. Schweizer sees this as unambiguous proof that Matthew has Joseph originally from Bethlehem. Evangelicals, of course, reject this view. France states that the author of Matthew does not discuss Joseph's origin in Nazareth because of his \"typical avoidance of unnecessary detail.\"\n\n"}

Therefore, S-waves can't propagate in liquids with zero (or very low) viscosity; However, they may propagate in liquids with high viscosity. \nThe name secondary wave comes from the fact that they are the second type of wave to be detected by an earthquake seismogram, after the compressional primary wave, or P-wave, because S-waves travel slower in rock. Unlike P-waves, S-waves cannot travel through the molten outer core of the Earth, and this causes a shadow zone for S-waves opposite to their origin. They can still propagate through the solid inner core: when a P-wave strikes the boundary of molten and solid cores at an oblique angle, S-waves will form and propagate in the solid medium. When these S-waves hit the boundary again at an oblique angle, they will in turn create P-waves that propagate through the liquid medium. This property allows seismologists to determine some physical properties of the Earth's inner core.\n\nIn 1830, the mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson presented to the French Academy of Sciences an essay (\"memoir\") with a theory of the propagation of elastic waves in solids. In his memoir, he states that an earthquake would produce two different waves: one having a certain speed formula_1 and the other having a speed formula_2. At a sufficient distance from the source, when they can be considered plane waves in the region of interest, the first kind consists of expansions and compressions in the direction perpendicular to the wavefront (that is, parallel to the wave's direction of motion); while the second consists of stretching motions occurring in directions parallel to the front (perpendicular to the direction of motion).\n\nFor the purpose of this explanation, a solid medium is considered isotropic if its strain (deformation) in response to stress is the same in all directions. Let formula_3 be the displacement vector of a particle of such a medium from its \"resting\" position formula_4 due elastic vibrations, understood to be a function of the rest position formula_5 and time formula_6. The deformation of the medium at that point can be described by the strain tensor formula_7, the 3×3 matrix whose elements are\n\nwhere formula_9 denotes partial derivative with respect to position coordinate formula_10. The strain tensor is related to the 3×3 stress tensor formula_11 by the equation\n\nHere formula_13 is the Kronecker delta (1 if formula_14, 0 otherwise) and formula_15 and formula_16 are the Lamé parameters (formula_16 being the material's shear modulus). It follows that\n\nFrom Newton's law of inertia, one also gets\n\nwhere formula_20 is the density (mass per unit volume) of the medium at that point, and formula_21 denotes partial derivative with respect to time. Combining the last two equations one gets the \"seismic wave equation in homogeneous media\"\n\nUsing the nabla operator notation of vector calculus, formula_23, with some approximations, this equation can be written as\n\nTaking the curl of this equation and applying vector identities, one gets\n\nThis formula is the wave equation applied to the vector quantity formula_26, which is the material's shear strain. Its solutions, the S-waves, are linear combinations of sinusoidal plane waves of various wavelengths and directions of propagation, but all with the same speed formula_27\n\nTaking the divergence of seismic wave equation in homogeneous media, instead of the curl, yields a wave equation describing propagation of the quantity formula_28, which is the material's compression strain. The solutions of this equation, the P-waves, travel at the speed formula_29 that is more than twice the speed formula_30 of S-waves.\n\nThe steady-state SH waves are defined by the Helmholtz equation\nwhere k is the wave number.\n\n\n"}

KG, or KGr in \"Luftwaffe\" usage during World War II, literally \"fight group\" or \"battle group\") can refer to a combat formation of any kind, but most usually to that employed by the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany and its allies during World War II and, to a lesser extent, of the German Empire in World War I.\n\nIt also referred to bomber groups in Luftwaffe usage, which themselves consisted of three or four \"Staffeln\" (squadrons), and usually (but \"not\" exclusively) existed within \"Kampfgeschwader\" bomber wings of three or four \"Kampfgruppen\" per wing.\n\nThe \"Kampfgruppe\" was an \"ad hoc\" combined arms formation, usually employing a combination of tanks, infantry, and artillery (including anti-tank) elements, generally organised for a particular task or operation.\n\nA \"Kampfgruppe\" could range in size from a company to a corps , but the most common was an \"Abteilung\" (battalion)-sized formation. \"Kampfgruppen\" were generally referred to by either their commanding officer's name or the parent division.\n\nThe Stormtroopers (in German \"Stoßtruppen\", \"shock troops\", literally \"punch/push troops\") were specialist military troops which were formed in the last years of World War I as the German army developed new methods of attacking enemy trenches, called \"infiltration tactics\". Men trained in these methods were known in German as \"Sturmmann\" (literally \"assault man\" but usually translated as Stormtrooper), formed into companies of \"Sturmtruppen\" (Storm Troops). Other armies have also used the term \"assault troops\", \"shock troops\" or fire teams for specialist soldiers who perform the infiltration tasks of stormtroopers.\n\nWith respect to their ad hoc nature and objective-oriented strategy, Finnish ski troops employed during the Soviet-Finnish Winter War of 1939-1940 could, in principle, be considered to be an equivalent to \"Kampfgruppen\". However, given the poor equipment of the Finnish forces, the combined-arms aspect of the \"Kampfgruppen\" could not have been applied. In the Continuation War (1941–44) battle groups (Finnish: \"taisteluosasto\") were commonly used by Finns and were now bigger having not only infantry but artillery and anti-tank units under commander of battle group. In many cases there were several units of different regiments, brigades and divisions in same battle group. For instance in June 1944 Battle group (Taisteluosasto) Ehrnrooth (commander of 7th Regiment) consisted: I/7th Regiment, III/7th Regiment, III/6th Regiment (minus its 9th inf company), fortification battalion 4, II/field artillery Regiment 19, light field artillery battalion 24, heavy artillery battalion 20 and heavy artillery battalion 27. For few days regiment commander had more firepower under his command than ordinary infantry division commander. Finnish battle groups were relatively short period ad hoc but very common phenomena especially in 1941 and 1944. Field artillery and even anti aircraft artillery units created their own artillery battle groups.\n\nHundreds of \"Kampfgruppen\" are documented to have taken part in operations ranging from a few days to over a year during the war. They left a significant impact in the popular culture and the picture of the Second World War. Famous examples include:\n\n\nWhile the original concept of \"Kampfgruppe\" is usually reserved to the land warfare, some German tacticians and strategists applied it also for naval warfare. The most obvious change was the design (units were usually earmarked for operation in advance instead of being organized ad hoc) and the type of units involved (instead of combined arms, different classes of naval vessels were employed). The examples include German \"Kampfgruppe 5\" employed during Operation Weserübung. This unit consisted of the heavy cruiser \"Blücher\", the heavy cruiser \"Lützow\", the light cruiser \"Emden\", 3 torpedo boats and 8 minesweepers carrying 2,000 troops to Oslo.\n\nDuring the Second World War Luftwaffe, Kampfgeschwader bomber units consisted of several \"Kampfgruppen\", which in terms of size were situated somewhere between squadrons and groups of Anglo-American air forces.\n\nCurrently, the formation closest in use is US Army Task force or the battlegroup formation used by several NATO countries, notably the UK and Norway. The Norwegian borderstation Korpfjell still use the German name \"Kampfgruppe Korpfjell\".\n\n"}

Kavka in \"The Toxin Puzzle\" (1983), and grew out of his work in deterrence theory and mutual assured destruction.\n\nKavka's original version of the puzzle is the following:\n\"An eccentric billionaire places before you a vial of toxin that, if you drink it, will make you painfully ill for a day, but will not threaten your life or have any lasting effects. The billionaire will pay you one million dollars tomorrow morning if, at midnight tonight, you \"intend\" to drink the toxin tomorrow afternoon. He emphasizes that you need not drink the toxin to receive the money; in fact, the money will already be in your bank account hours before the time for drinking it arrives, if you succeed. All you have to do is. . . intend at midnight tonight to drink the stuff tomorrow afternoon. You are perfectly free to change your mind after receiving the money and not drink the toxin.\"\nA possible interpretation: Can you intend to drink the toxin if you also intend to change your mind at a later time?\n\nThe paradoxical nature can be stated in many ways, which may be useful for understanding analysis proposed by philosophers:\n\nSince the pain caused by the poison would be more than off-set by the money received, we can sketch the pay-off table as follows.\nAccording to Kavka: Drinking the poison is never to your advantage regardless of whether you are paid. A rational person would know he would not drink the poison and thus could not intend to drink it.\nDavid Gauthier argues once a person intends drinking the poison one cannot entertain ideas of not drinking it.\n\nOne of the central tenets of the puzzle is that for a reasonable person\n\nThus a reasonable person must intend to drink the toxin by the first argument, yet if that person intends to drink the toxin, he is being irrational by the second argument.\n\n\n"}

He graduated with a B.A. in Speech from Butler University, where he was a champion debater. In 1967 he graduated with a M.A. in Rhetoric from Cornell University. In 1973 he married Lyda Eugenia Twitty. In 1974 he received his Ph.D. from the University of Iowa, writing his dissertation \"Edmund Burke's Beautiful Life: An Exploration of the Relationship between Rhetoric and Social Theory\" under Donald C. Bryant. He received some criticism for his teaching because of his staunch liberalism, which had an effect on his teaching style, but despite this, he was still a very sought-after professor, teaching at major universities in the United States such as the University of Alabama, the University of Memphis, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He is known for his materialistic views of rhetoric, summarized from the lesser known McGee essay \"The Practical Identity of Thought and Its Expression\". In 1979 he moved to Iowa City, where he settled in at the University of Iowa.\n\nMcGee had many major contributions in the realm of rhetoric and in cultural studies. He published three major works: Rhetoric in Postmodern America, The Ideograph: A Link between Rhetoric and Ideology, and Text, Context, and the Fragmentation of Contemporary Culture. The most important of these is considered to be his second major work, The Ideograph. McGee was the first rhetorical theorist to propose this concept on an ideograph, which he described as, \"an ordinary-language term found in political discourse. It is a high order abstraction representing commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal.\" Also he was a critic of what he saw going on in the world around him. The most well-known of these critiques was his critique of Spike Lee and his association with Nike ads. McGee said that these ads were too racially stereotypical and made a case for Lee to cease these ads but Lee continued with them nonetheless.\n\nMcGee was one of the founders of the American Communication Association and a member of the National Communication Association. In his last years he was very active in virtual rhetorical communities and on-line debates. McGee founded a website, (f)ragments, for rhetorical research and created a virtual learning community.\n\n"}

It provides services to individual and business clients. The core business activity of PKO Bank Polski is retail banking. The full Polish name roughly translates to \"General Savings Bank\". Popularly, only the acronym \"PKO\" is used by clients. \n\nWith 1,145 branches located in Poland and abroad and a market capitalization of PLN 52 billion (EUR 12.6 billion equivalent) as of 2018, PKO BP Group is among the largest financial institutions in Poland and is also one of the largest financial groups in Central and Eastern Europe. \n\nOn February 7, 1919, by the order of the Head of State Józef Piłsudski, the Postal Savings Bank was created. Its first director was appointed on December 28, 1919, Hubert Linde. For many years during the Second Polish Republic, Henryk Gruber was the president of the PKO. With time, a bank's head office was established in Warsaw with headquarters at ul. Świętokrzyska 31/33 and the first local branches: in Kraków, Lwów, Łódź, Poznań and Katowice. The first goal of the PKO was to introduce the Polish zloty into circulation instead of the Polish marka (as a derivative of the Reichsmark). From 1920, the bank had a legal personality as a state institution. The employees of the funds were associated in the Association of Postal Savers Workers, which had their own wheels at larger branches, e.g. in Warsaw, in Łódź.\n\nDuring the German occupation of Poland, in Second World War, Bank Polski operated under German management.\n\nIn 1945, the cash register activity was resumed. On January 1, 1950, the Postal Savings Fund was liquidated, and its agencies were taken over by the General Savings Bank (). In 1974, the PKO offer was enriched with a savings and settlement account for natural persons (commonly known as ROR).\n\nFrom 1975 to 1987, the PKO branches operated within the structures of the National Bank of Poland, retaining their identity.\nOn November 1, 1987, PKO Bank Polski became an independent bank again, as part of the economic reforms implemented by the communist government of Poland in its last years.\n\nToday (as at the end of 2015) PKO Bank Polski employs around 29,000 people and has a full-year net profit of over 7 billion PLN (more than 2 billion US dollars). Its assets are worth more than 285 billion PLN (around 80 billion US dollars). Bank was ranked 510 in the Forbes Global 2000 for year 2010. The bank is also present outside Poland, notably in Ukraine after the acquisition of KredoBank (Кредобанк). The company is headquartered in central Warsaw.\n\nBecause of its size and position as one of the first banks, PKO Bank Polski is still one of the best recognized and most valuable brands in Poland. Specialists from The Banker magazine estimated the value of Bank's brand at US$1 billion and in Rzeczpospolita \"Polish Brands 2010\" ranking its value was set at PLN 3.6 billion. In the 2011 edition of ranking \"The BrandFinance® Banking 500\" prepared by the British firm Brand Finance, which includes the most valuable bank brands in the world, PKO Bank Polski brand was valued at US$1.480 billion. It gives PKO Bank Polski the 1st place in Poland and Central and Eastern Europe and 114th place in the world.\n\nAlthough floated on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, as of May 2019 the state still directly and indirectly holds 51.24% of shares (40.99% belong to State Treasury and 10.25% to state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego).\n\nPKO Bank Polski is the leader of the Capital Group. In addition to the parent, the group structure includes wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and associates. These pursue their own business objectives whilst supporting the Bank's sales objectives and acting as its service providers. The subsidiary companies also complement the Bank's offer with such services as leasing, settlement of electronic card transactions, factoring and investment fund management.\n\nCompanies in PKO Bank Polski Capital Group - Direct subsidiaries:\n"}

At age 16, he moved with his mother Anne, brother Nick, stepbrother and stepfather to Boca Raton, Florida. Carrabba remains close to some relatives on his paternal side, but is not close to his father specifically.\n\nAs a teenager, Carrabba was interested in skateboarding and passionate about music. In high school, he started singing in his choir. At 15, his uncle gave him a guitar to which he devoted a great deal of his time. After graduating from Boca Raton Community High School, Carrabba became more serious about music and joined his first band, The Vacant Andys, and matriculated to Florida Atlantic University to study education.\n\nAt college, alongside studies, Carrabba played with The Vacant Andys and, later, with The Agency, which featured Chris Carrabba on their second LP, \"ENGINES\". This was the first recording to feature both Mike Marsh and Chris Carrabba before Mike Marsh became Dashboard Confessional's full-time drummer. For several years, Chris taught at an elementary school in South Florida and played with the group Further Seems Forever.\n\nDashboard Confessional was born when Chris recorded the \"Drowning\" EP with Fiddler Records. \"I started (Dashboard) as a side project from the band I was in,\" says Carrabba. \"I was going through something really tough at the time and since I don't write in a journal, this is what I did with it. It was a good way to get it out of my system. I never thought anyone would hear these songs, but I played some for my friends and one of them who owned a little label talked me into recording.\" The name Dashboard Confessional comes from the song \"The Sharp Hint of New Tears.\" The lyric \"On the way home, this car hears my confessions\" brought to mind the phrase \"Dashboard Confessional.\"\n\nHaving received his first guitar from his uncle Angelo, Carrabba took only a mild interest in his musical talent, preferring to skateboard. He taught himself to play at the age of 15, and recorded his first solo album, \"The Swiss Army Romance\".\n\nCarrabba was a special education teacher prior to his success with Dashboard Confessional, often keeping a guitar in his office to write songs during downtime.\n\nIn 2008, just as he was wrapping up work on the sixth Dashboard Confessional album, Carrabba's sister was in a serious car accident that put her in a coma for several months. \"I was torn between being with her through most of her waking hours until we were kicked out of the hospital at the end of their shifts and going home and doing my work,\" he said.\n\nCarrabba started his career with the Vacant Andys. In 1998, while playing with the Vacant Andys, he filled in on guitar in New Found Glory, when regular guitarist Chad Gilbert was on tour with his other band, Shai Hulud. In 2001, he joined the band Further Seems Forever for their debut album The Moon is Down, before moving on to found Dashboard Confessional. In 2002, Dashboard Confessional won the MTV2 Award at MTV Music Awards for the video for \"Screaming Infidelities.\" The video was considered the \"dark horse\" nominee at the time, as it was up against The Strokes, The Hives, Norah Jones, Nappy Roots, and Musiq. The video was directed by Maureen Egan and Matthew Barry.\n\nIt was announced on August 24, 2010, that Further Seems Forever would be reuniting with original vocalist Chris Carrabba with the release of a teaser video featuring rehearsal footage of the song \"The Moon Is Down.\"\n\nIn November 2011, Carrabba released an album of covers entitled \"Covered in the Flood\" exclusively on his solo US tour. The album contains 10 tracks originally performed by artists that include R.E.M., Big Star, Guy Clark, Justin Townes Earle and The Replacements.\n\n"}
{"id": "1937255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937255", "title": "Carl Kellner (mystic)", "text": "Carl Kellner (mystic)\n\nCarl Kellner (1 September 1851 – June 7, 1905) was a chemist, inventor, and industrialist. He made significant improvements to the sulfite process and was co-inventor of the Castner-Kellner process. He was a student of Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, and Eastern mysticism. He was the putative founder of Ordo Templi Orientis.\n\nCarl Kellner is reputed to have developed the Ritter-Kellner process while working for Baron Hector Von Ritter-Zahony in 1876. In 1889 he established the Kellner-Partington paper pulp Co in association with Edward Partington.\n\nThe process for making caustic soda and chlorine by electrolysis of brine using a mercury electrode was developed independently by Mr Hamilton Y. Castner and Dr Carl Kellner in 1892. They established the Castner Kellner company jointly to exploit their patents in 1895.\n\nIt is not known when he obtained his doctorate but he used the title of PhD from 1895.\n\nKellner had become a Freemason in 1873, being initiated at the Humanitas Lodge on the Austro-Hungarian border, taking the motto of Brother Renatus. In 1885, Kellner met the Theosophical and Rosicrucian scholar, Dr. Franz Hartmann (1838–1912). He and Hartmann later collaborated on the development of the \"ligno-sulphite\" inhalation therapy for tuberculosis, which formed the basis of treatment at Hartmann's sanitarium near Saltzburg. During this period Kellner became interested in the more esoteric aspects of Freemasonry, joining John Yarker's Rite of Memphis-Misraim. Hartmann's obituary of Kellner describes that in 1902 Kellner\n\n\"...was personally initiated in Manchester by Brother Yarker into the 96°, and made Sovereign Honorary General Grand Master of our Order\"\n\nDuring extensive travels in Europe, America, and Asia Minor, Kellner claimed to have come into contact with three adepts (a Sufi, Soliman ben Aifa, and two Hindu Tantrics, Bhima Sena Pratapa of Lahore and Sri Mahatma Agamya Paramahamsa), and an organization called the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. These adepts are attributed with having initiated Kellner into the use of sexual magick (sometimes referred to as 'the sexual current' by ritual magicians). Kellner was also influenced by a French followers of the American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph.\n\nDuring the course of his esoteric studies, Kellner believed that he had discovered a \"key\" which offered a clear explanation of all the complex symbolism of Freemasonry, and, Kellner believed, opened the mysteries of nature. Kellner developed a desire to form an Academia Masonica which would enable Freemasons to become familiar with all existing Masonic degrees and systems.\n\nIn 1895, Kellner began to discuss his idea for founding this Academia Masonica with his associate Theodor Reuss (aka Frater Merlin or Peregrinus). During these discussions, Kellner decided that the Academia Masonica should be called Ordo Templi Orientis (Oriental Templar Order). The occult inner circle of this order (O.T.O. proper) would be organized parallel to the highest degrees of the Rite of Memphis-Misraim and would teach the esoteric Rosicrucian doctrines of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light, and Kellner's \"key\" to Masonic symbolism. Both men and women would be admitted at all levels to this order, but possession of the various degrees of Craft and high-grade Freemasonry would be a prerequisite for admission to the inner circle of O.T.O.\n\nDue to the regulations of the established grand lodges which governed Regular Masonry, women could not be made Masons and would therefore be excluded by default from membership in Ordo Templi Orientis. Reforming the Masonic system to allow the admission of women may have been one of the reasons that Kellner and his associates resolved to obtain control over one of the many rites of Masonry; possibly because of wishing to incorporate the practice of sex magic. They may have believed that sex magic was \"...the key to all the secrets of the universe and to all the symbolism ever used by secret societies and religions.\"\n\nThe discussions between Reuss and Kellner did not lead to any positive results at the time, because Reuss was very busy with a revival of the Order of Illuminati along with his associate Leopold Engel of Dresden. Kellner did not approve of the revived Illuminati Order or of Engel. According to Reuss, upon his final separation with Engel in June 1902, Kellner contacted him and the two agreed to proceed with the establishment of Ordo Templi Orientis by seeking authorizations to work the various rites of high-grade Masonry. Reuss and Kellner together prepared a brief manifesto for their order in 1903, which was published the next year in The Oriflamme. However whether Kellner ever lived to see O.T.O. becoming more than just these early plans is debatable, since he died in 1905, not long after the first announcements were made.\n\n"}

The album sold over three million units worldwide, with a total of 2.1 million copies in the U.S., where it was certified double platinum. The album won the 2006 Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, and earned Legend another two awards, for Best New Artist and Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for his single \"Ordinary People\".\n\nReviews became generally positive. BBC Music gave the album a favorable review and called it \"an album that not only lived up to the hype, but rose squarely above it. Yes, at times it is a patchwork of the past filtered through Legend’s ever-present influences, but the quality of his writing and performance, and his collaborators’ contributions, make it worthy of the awards and plaudits it rightly received.\" \"Spin\" gave it an A− and said that Legend's voice \"leans on subtlety more than melisma, and his sound has a crisp live-band jump, rather than canned neo-soul static.\" \"Uncut\" gave it three stars out of five and stated that Legend \"introduces some intriguing new variations on the retro R&B template...Jeff Buckley is surprisingly brought to mind in Legend's passionately fragile delivery.\" IGN gave it a score of 9.3 out of ten and called it \"a refreshing record that fans of music will adore.\" \"The Guardian\" gave it four stars out of five and called it \"a real gem.\" Entertainment.ie also gave it four stars and said of Legend, \"it's probably not surprising that he's got such a big head, seeing as his producer, hip-hop guru Kanye West, has described him as simply 'the future'.

I approached with trepidation after the opening Prelude but with an open mind or just an appreciation for the finer things in life Get Lifted could find itself being an essential album in anyone’s collection.\" \"Paste\" gave it a positive review and stated that it \"has as much in common with the classic funk and soul of Isaac Hayes, Stevie Wonder and The Delfonics as it does with today’s best R&B, hip-hop and neo-soul.\" \"The A.V. Club\" gave it an average review and stated that the album \"suffers from a surplus of slickness, but it's also seductive, and at just over 52 minutes, mercifully free from the excess and filler that characterize many rap and R&B albums.\" \"Exclaim!\", however, gave it an unfavorable review and said, \"The early line on Legend is that the heat this album will undoubtedly generate guarantees that Legend’s apparent fidelity issues will get worse before they get better. \"Get Lifted\" indeed.\" \"Plugged In\" gave it a mixed review and stated that \"Legend is a talented singer and piano player but fails to maintain his moral focus. It doesn't take much profanity, infidelity and sexual inappropriateness to sink an otherwise decent effort.\"\n\n\"Rhapsody\" ranked the album #10 on its \"Best R&B Albums of the Decade\" list, declaring, \"John Legend was all over the Top 40 the entire decade—even before he released one of the decade’s biggest R&B debuts—having worked with Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, Kanye West and Jay-Z, to name a few. Get Lifted, his first proper release, is an infectious cross between old-school soul and neo-soul.\"\n\n\nCredits adapted from album’s liner notes.\n\n"}

It lies near the cities of El Alto and La Paz at the eastern edge of the Altiplano. It is the second highest peak in Bolivia, after Nevado Sajama, and the eighteenth highest peak in South America. The snow line lies at about above sea level, and glaciers are found on the northern face at . The mountain has four main peaks; the highest is the south summit, Nevado Illimani, which is a popular ascent for mountain climbers.\n\nGeologically, Illimani is composed primarily of granodiorite, intruded during the Cenozoic era into the sedimentary rock, which forms the bulk of the Cordillera Real.\n\nIllimani is quite visible from the cities of El Alto and La Paz, and is their major landmark. The mountain has been the subject of many local songs, most importantly \"Illimani\", with the following refrain: \"¡Illimani, Illimani, centinela tú eres de La Paz! ¡Illimani, Illimani, perla andina eres de Bolivia!\" (\"Illimani, Illimani, you are the sentinel of La Paz! Illimani, Illimani, you are Bolivia's andean pearl!\")\n\nIllimani was first attempted in 1877 by the French explorator Charles Wiener, J. de Grumkow, and J. C. Ocampo. They failed to reach the main summit, but did reach a southeastern subsummit, on 19 May 1877, Wiener named it the \"Pic de Paris\", and left a French flag on top of it. \nIn 1898, British climber William Martin Conway and two Italian guides, J.A. Maquignaz and L. Pellissier, made the first recorded ascent of the peak, again from the southeast.

Among his achievements, he is generally regarded a founder of the Royal Norwegian Air Force.\n\nRiiser-Larsen was born in Kristiania, Norway. In 1909, aged nineteen, he joined the Norwegian Naval Academy. In 1915 he became a 1st lieutenant in the newly formed Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service (RNoNAS). After World War I, he served as the acting head of the RNoNAS's factory until a more senior officer was appointed. In 1921, he joined the Aviation Council, then part of the Norwegian Ministry of Defence, as a secretary. This gave him the opportunity to study the fledgling military and civil aviation infrastructure for which the Council was responsible. He also became a frequent pilot on the air routes used by the new aviation companies.\n\nRiiser-Larsen's years of polar exploration began in 1925 when his compatriot Roald Amundsen, the famed polar explorer, asked him to be his deputy and pilot for an attempt to fly over the North Pole. Riiser-Larsen agreed and secured the use of two Dornier Do J Wal seaplanes, with Karl Feucht as one of two expedition flight mechanics. The expedition, however, was forced to land close to the Pole, badly damaging one of the planes. After twenty-six days on an ice shelf, first trying to shovel tons of snow to create an airstrip, until someone suggested the easier way of tramping the snow surface, the expedition's six members squeezed themselves into the remaining plane. Riiser-Larsen somehow managed to coax the overloaded plane into the air and flew the expedition back to the coast of Northern Svalbard.\n\nThe following year, Riiser-Larsen rejoined Amundsen for another attempt to fly over the Pole, this time with Italian aeronautical engineer Umberto Nobile in his recently renamed airship, the \"Norge\". Leaving Spitsbergen on 11 May 1926, the \"Norge\" completed the crossing two days later, landing near Teller, Alaska. The flight is considered by many to be the first successful flight over the North Pole, as the other claimants, Frederick Cook, Robert Peary and Richard Byrd, were unable to verify their attempts in full.\n\nIn 1928, Riiser-Larsen became involved in searching the Arctic for Nobile after he had made a successful flight to the Siberian islands and visited the North Pole once more, but crashed near the coast of the North Eastern part of Svalbard. Riiser-Larsen also became involved in a search for Amundsen, when he as passenger in a French naval flying boat went missing while he was en route to join the search for Nobile. Eventually Nobile and most of his team were found, but Amundsen was not.\n\nThe \"Norvegia\" expeditions were a sequence of Antarctic expeditions financed by the Norwegian shipowner and whaling merchant Lars Christensen during the late 1920s and 1930s. Ostensibly their goal was scientific research and the discovery of new whaling grounds, but Christensen also requested permission from the Norwegian Foreign Office to claim for Norway any uncharted territory that was found. By the end of the second expedition, two small islands in the Southern Ocean, Bouvet Island and Peter I Island, had been annexed. In 1929 Christensen decided to include aeroplanes in the next expedition and appointed Riiser-Larsen its leader. Riiser-Larsen then supervised and took part in mapping most of the Antarctic in this and three further expeditions. More territory was also annexed, this time the large area of the continent known as Queen Maud Land.\n\nIn 1939, the Norwegian military was downsized and Riiser-Larssen was among those officers finding themselves out of work. However, he was quickly offered a new job by the shipping company Fred. Olsen & Co. as manager of its newly formed airline, DNL. He invited some former naval pilots to join the airline and soon made it the most successful in Norway. In 1946, DNL would be one of the four Scandinavian airlines merged to create the present-day Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).\n\nDuring the Nazi German occupation of Norway, Riiser-Larsen rejoined the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service. However, both the Norwegian Army and Royal Norwegian Navy Air Services were quickly overwhelmed by the Wehrmacht before he saw combat. Instead, he accompanied the Norwegian cabinet and military leaders into exile in London, before moving on to Canada, to become the first commander of the Royal Norwegian Air Force training camp dubbed \"Little Norway\" in Ontario.\n\nAt the beginning of 1941, Riiser-Larsen returned to London to take up the post of Commander in Chief of the Naval Air Service; then of the Combined Arms Air Force; and finally, in 1944, of the fully amalgamated Royal Norwegian Air Force. By the end of the war, however, many of the pilots under his command had become critical of his leadership. He resigned, bitterly, from the Air Force in 1946.\nIn 1947, Riiser-Larsen again became the head of DNL, a few months before it merged with DDL, SIL and ABA to create SAS. He was the director of the Norwegian region of Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS) 1950-55. He then became an advisor to the SAS executive and a regional manager with responsibility for transcontinental air routes. One of these routes, although established after his retirement in 1955, represented the \"fulfilment of a vision\" : the route to North America over the North Pole.\n\nIn 1951 Riiser-Larsen was chosen as the president of the World Movement for Federal World Government.\n\nRiiser-Larsen died in 1965, four days before his seventy-fifth birthday, and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund in Oslo.\n\n"}

The city centre is on the western bank where the inlet meets the Coral Sea.\n\nIn prehistoric times, the Trinity Inlet was the river mouth of the Mulgrave River. Volcanic activity resulted in the rise of Green Hill in the Mulgrave Valley, but contrary to popular belief this did not block the river, as sediments continued to build up over the volcanic rocks. The Mulgrave River later shifted course and now empties into the Coral Sea further south at the southern extremity of the Yarrabah Hills range. \n\nTrinity Inlet is lined with mangroves and mudflats. Within the inlet a large mud island has been formed and was given the name Admiralty Island. Concerns have been raised about the amount of debris and derelict shipping that exist in the upper regions of the inlet.\n\nCommercially the inlet provides a limited deep-water berthing for the port of Cairns, allowing the export of cane sugar. The region's only tanker berth and the Royal Australian Navy base HMAS \"Cairns\" are located on the inlet. Several shipbuilders and tour operators that visit the Great Barrier Reef operate from the Reef Terminal on the entrance to the inlet.\n\nRemnants of a levee can be found on the eastern bank opposite Cairns. This was an effort by CSR in the 1970s to cultivate sugar cane on mostly intertidal land previously occupied by mangroves and saltmarsh. This was not successful due to the disturbance of a large area of acid sulfate soil. Discharge of sulfuric acid into Trinity inlet from this land resulted in a number of fish kills. In recent years, the Queensland Government has undertaken a major remediation project to prevent the acid discharge and rehabilitate the land behind the levee. \n\nThe inlet offers shelter to small vessels when tropical cyclones threaten. A commercial saltwater crocodile farm is in operation on the upper reaches, though wild examples are still very rare in the area after hunting in the early 20th century.\n\n"}

Ltd. first took a serious interest in generating hydro-electric power from one of Tasmania's highland rivers in late 1909, to provide power for James Gillies' newly patented electrolytic process for zinc refining, and a \"carbide\" smelter to be constructed near Snug. They resolved to construct a hydro-electric power plant in the valley of the Ouse River, above the town that bears that name. Water was to be provided by a small dam on the great lake at Miena, which would then divert water down the steep drop using a woodstave pipeline and a flume. Construction began in earnest in 1910.\n\nHowever, the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Power and Metallurgical Co. ran out of money before the scheme could be completed, and they sold the incomplete works to the newly formed Hydro-Electric Department in 1914. The works were completed under Hydro-Electric Department ownership in 1915, and the plant was officially opened in 1916. It was the first plant ever operated by them.\n\nThe plant operated at its original capacity of from 1916 via 2 x 4,900HP(3.65MW) turbines; a 3rd turbine was added in 1919. After 1922, 6 x 8,000HP (5.96MW) turbines were installed to meet increased demand.\n\nIn 1931, the Hydro-Electric Commission decided to construct a completely new plant to replace the original Waddamana power station (to be known as (Waddamana A). However, a lack of funds forced them to build it alongside the existing plant instead. Between 1939 and 1949, construction took place for Waddamana B, and until 1965, two power plants were in operation at Waddamana. The new plant was referred to as Waddamana B, and it generated of electricity from four turbines.\n\nBoth Waddamana plants operated through the 1940s and 1950s, but, in the early 1960s, construction of a new, larger power plant at Poatina began. Designed to replace the two Waddamana plants, with the small Shannon plant nearby, the Poatina power plant was opened in 1964 with a capacity of , over three times the combined capacity of the plants it replaced. In order for the Poatina plant to be successful, it was necessary to stop the flow of water through Waddamana A and Shannon, both of which were decommissioned (Shannon in 1964, Waddamana A in 1965). The Shannon plant was demolished, but the two Waddamana plants remained standing. Waddamana B remained in active service until 1995 when it too was closed. Waddamana A now has a new life as a museum filled with original equipment and other displays, including the Control room switchboard from the Shannon Power Station.\n\nWaddamana 'A' station is listed as a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\n\n"}

After studying piano (with his mother, a former opera singer) and then the viola, he moved on to study composition. Bergsma attended Stanford University for two years (1938–40) before moving to the Eastman School of Music, where he earned his bachelor's and master's degrees; his most significant teachers there were Howard Hanson and Bernard Rogers.\n\nIn 1946 he accepted a position at Juilliard, where he remained until 1963, eventually holding such positions as chair of composition and from 1961 to 1963, associate dean. In 1963 he moved on to the University of Washington, heading the music school until 1971, remaining a professor from then on after stepping down from the administrative post. In 1966 Bergsma founded the Contemporary Group at the University of Washington, an organization of composers and musicians who stage performances of new musical works and educate students and the public about contemporary music; the group remains active to this day.\n\nBergsma was the recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, and an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Students of Bergsma include composers Jack Behrens, Philip Glass, Karl Korte, Robert Parris, and Steve Reich.\n\nBergsma's music is noted for its lyrical, contrapuntal qualities. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Bergsma rejected serialism in favor of a more conservative style, though one distinctly rooted in the 20th century. He eschewed the avant-garde—his obituary in the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" describes him as having \"never deserted tonality\" and seeing \"dozens of his former avant-garde colleagues returning to the fold\"—though he did embrace aleatoric techniques later in his career.\n\nHe composed two operas, \"The Wife of Martin Guerre\" (1956) and \"The Murder of Comrade Sharik\" (1973), which are markedly different in style. The first is a somber tale of a 16th-century French peasant's disappearance and return upon which he is suspected to be an impostor; the music is marked by dissonance which emphasizes the tension in the story, particularly in the final courtroom scene. The second is more lighthearted and comic; Bergsma wrote his own libretto after the story \"Heart of a Dog\" by Mikhail Bulgakov, which involves a dog transforming into a citizen of 1920s Moscow as a result of a doctor's experiments. The partially aleatoric orchestral writing is intended to be the voice of Stalin, and uses quotes from \"Carmen\", \"La traviata\" and \"Don Giovanni\" for comedic effect. He was also a skillful composer of smaller works, including many for chamber ensemble and solo piano as well as orchestral writings.\n\nBergsma died in Seattle of a heart attack, at the age of 72.\n\n\n\n"}

It first aired on November 26, 2003 on the UPN network in the United States. The episode was written by executive producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, and directed by Mike Vejar.\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. Season three of the series shows the ship enter the Delphic Expanse to search for a Xindi superweapon in response to an attack on Earth. In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and Sub-commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) travel back to early 21st century Earth to find a group of Xindi-Reptilians who were seeking to wipe out the human race by using a biological agent.\n\nThe production of the episode used several different methods to represent 21st century Detroit, including exterior shots in Los Angeles, the Paramount studios downtown New York standing sets and exterior sets at the Lacy Street Production Center. The guest cast featured Matt Winston returning as Temporal Agent Daniels, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as a Xindi-Reptilian. It had the lowest number of viewers of season three at that point according to the Nielsen ratings, a decline that was attributed to pre-Thanksgiving travel. Critical response was mostly negative, with criticism directed at the nature of the plot.\n\nTemporal Agent Daniels informs Captain Archer that three Reptilians have traveled back in time to Detroit, Michigan, to the year 2004, where they intend to produce a bio-weapon to annihilate Humans. The Xindi Council had banned the use of bio-weapons, forcing the Reptilians to take extraordinary measures. Daniels sends Archer and Sub-Commander T'Pol back in time to investigate, and provides Archer with temporal tags to bring back anything foreign to that time-frame.\n\nUsing a hand scanner, Archer is able to steal a vehicle, and T'Pol locates the Xindi bio-signs leading them to an abandoned factory on Carpenter Street. They notice Loomis, a blood bank employee, exiting the building. Suspecting something, they follow him home. After he tries to escape, T'Pol uses the Vulcan nerve pinch to stop him. When he awakes, he believes that Archer and T'Pol are police officers, and requests a lawyer. Archer punches him, and he admits delivering six bodies to his mysterious employers, each one for a different blood type. Archer comes up with a plan, and decides to pose as one of the victims.\n\nAfter being delivered by Loomis, Archer realizes that they are developing some sort of a bio-weapon. Archer begins destroying their technology, and kills one of the three Reptilians. Two others try to escape with the deadly bio-agent, and Archer kills another one as they flee. The last Xindi escapes due to the interference of Loomis, who T'Pol stuns with her phaser. On the factory's roof, Archer corners him as he attempts to release the bio-agent. Archer and T'Pol tag all non-21st-century artifacts, and return to \"Enterprise\". Loomis, still groggy in his car, is apprehended by real police officers and attempts to explain the \"lizard people\" and their \"ray guns.\"\n\nThe episode was written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, the executive producers of \"\". It was directed by Mike Vejar, his sixth episode of the series. He previously directed episodes for three other \"Star Trek\" series. When asked about the use of time travel stories in \"Star Trek\" in relation to \"Carpenter Street\", Scott Bakula said that \"Obviously it's something you want to be careful of, and yet at the same time I'm told that the fans love the time travel episodes, and there's certainly an effort on Rick and Brannon's part to write things that they hope the fans will love. This particular journey back in time is very grounded in story.\" He added that he believed that the setting for the episode was chosen because the production values were \"easily accomplished\" and that \"because the episode deals with germ warfare, and that certainly is a relevant topic today.\"\n\nGuest stars on the episode included Matt Winston, who appeared for the fourth time as Temporal Agent Daniels, having previously played the role most recently in the second episode of \"\". Returning to \"Star Trek\", but appearing for the first time in \"Enterprise\", was Leland Orser, who played Loomis. The actor had previously appeared in the \"\" episode \"\", as well as the \"\" episodes \"\" and \"\". Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying supervillian Negan in the TV adaptation of the comic book series \"The Walking Dead\" and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film \"Watchmen\", strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in \"Carpenter Street\". He later explained to \"Entertainment Weekly\" that \"I had to pay my bills. I knew I'd play some guy saying some stuff. Then I got a call saying I needed to go in for a prosthetic fitting. I remember them dripping goop on my face, and I had straws sticking out of my nose. I couldn't eat lunch. I was claustrophobic. I'd go home in tears. This was the job that made me want to quit acting.\"\n\nFilming began October 10, 2003, on the standing \"Enterprise\" sets as well as a temporary set which represented Loomis' apartment. This filming continued on the following Monday, where filming was shared with production on both \"\" and \"\". On October 13, the location filming began for \"Carpenter Street\" in downtown Los Angeles. As these scenes take place in darkness, filming did not start until dusk and the shoot was conducted overnight. The filming on the first night comprised the scenes where the characters were in 21st century vehicles, and the rest of the week was spent at the Lacy Street Production Center, which had urban settings which could represent the downtown Detroit area. During the following week, the production moved back to the Paramount lot where the standing New York Street backlot was used; this included the use of one area where a scene from Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" (1972) had been shot. The episode finished filming on October 23, including an overlap with the production of \"Chosen Realm\" on October 22.\n\n\"Carpenter Street\" first aired on November 26, 2003 on the UPN network in the United States. It received a Nielsen rating of 2.9/4 percent, meaning that it was watched by 2.9 percent of all adults and 4 percent of all adults watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was the lowest ratings received by any episode during the third season. This slump had been attributed to the date of the broadcast, which had taken place on the night before Thanksgiving, a day which typically sees a large number of people travel, thereby decreasing the overall ratings of television shows.\n\nIn her review for the website TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green said that the episode entertained, but was an \"ultimately pointless time-travel episode that redeems its existence primarily by not requiring a reset button.\" But she thought that Orser was \"superb\" as the \"repugnant\" Loomis, and the episode was \"entertaining fluff\" but was \"warm and witty and well-done.\" Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website \"Jammer's Reviews\", called the episode a \"turkey\" and said that it was \"a mediocre time-travel bore with barely enough plot for me to accuse of not making sense.\" He criticized the lack of explanation given to the Xindi's involvement in the Temporal Cold War, and said that the plot itself was akin to \"swiss cheese\" due to the number of plot holes. He gave the episode a score of one and a half out of four.\n\nIn 2019, \"Higgy Pop\" noted this episode as one of the time travel stories of the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\n\nA home media release of \"Carpenter Street\" has been as part of the season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 27, 2005. The Blu-ray release of \"Enterprise\" was announced in early 2013, and released on January 7, 2014.\n\n"}
{"id": "1937323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937323", "title": "Gastric lavage", "text": "Gastric lavage\n\nGastric lavage, also commonly called stomach pumping or gastric irrigation, is the process of cleaning out the contents of the stomach. Since its first recorded use in early 19th century, it has become one of the most routine means of eliminating poisons from the stomach. Such devices are normally used on a person who has ingested a poison or overdosed on a drug such as Methyl alcohol. They may also be used before surgery, to clear the contents of the digestive tract before it is opened.\n\nApart from toxicology, gastric lavage (or nasogastric lavage) is sometimes used to confirm levels of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. It may play a role in the evaluation of hematemesis. It can also be used as a cooling technique for hyperthermic patients.\n\nGastric lavage involves the passage of a tube (such as an \"Ewald tube\") via the mouth or nose down into the stomach followed by sequential administration and removal of small volumes of liquid. The placement of the tube in the stomach must be confirmed by pH testing a small amount of aspirated stomach contents, or x-ray. This is to ensure the tube is not in the lungs. In adults, small amounts of warm water or saline are administered and, via a siphoning action, removed again. In children, normal saline is used, as children are more at risk of developing hyponatremia if lavaged with water. Because of the possibility of vomiting, a suction device is always on hand in case of pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents. Lavage is repeated until the returning fluid shows no further gastric contents. If the patient is unconscious or cannot protect their airway then the patient should be intubated before performing lavage. The person must be put to sleep for a period of time during the operation due to its high risk of shock and hyponatremia.\n\nGastric lavage is used infrequently in modern poisoning treatment. Some authorities have actually suggested that it not be used routinely, if ever, in poisoning situations. Lavage should only be considered if the amount of poison ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Lavage is also the initial treatment for duodenal atresia in newborns, a condition where the small intestine is closed distal to the stomach, causing food and fluid to accumulate in the stomach. When the body temperature rises above 40 °C, gastric lavage with iced saline also can be an aggressive cooling measure in a medical emergency.\n\nLavage is contraindicated when patients have a compromised, unprotected airway and in patients at risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage or perforation. Relative contraindications include when the poisoning is due to a corrosive substance (strong acids or strong bases) (), hydrocarbons (), or for poisons that have an effective antidote.\nit is also contraindicated in case of aluminum phosphide poisoning.\n\nMany complications have been reported, although it appears serious complications are uncommon. The most dangerous risk is aspiration pneumonia, which is more likely to occur if hydrocarbons are ingested in patients without a protected airway. Other complications include laryngospasm, hypoxia, bradycardia, epistaxis, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, water intoxication, or mechanical injury to the stomach.\n\n"}

He was a professional singer in his youth, and was introduced to Ludwig II of Bavaria, in 1873. He took part in the first performance of Wagner's \"Parsifal\" at Bayreuth in 1882. Reuss later became a newspaper correspondent, and travelled frequently as such to England, where he became a Mason at the Pilger Loge No. 238 of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1876. He also spent some time there as a journalist and as a music-hall singer under the stage name \"Charles Theodore.\"\n\nIn 1876, Reuss married a woman ten years his senior, Delphina Garbois from Dublin, and moved to Munich in 1878. Their marriage was annulled, due to bigamy (Hergemöller, 1998). They had a son, Albert Franz Theodor Reuss (1879–1958), a self-educated zoologist who lived in Berlin (Krecsák and Bohle 2008).\n\nIn 1885, in England, Reuss joined the Socialist League. He had been quite involved as a librarian and labour secretary. On May 7, 1886 he was expelled as a police spy in the pay of the Prussian Secret Police. This took place in a sectarian atmosphere, with tensions between anarcho-communist Josef Peukert and the Bakuninist Victor Dave where such accusations were often made without substance. However, this accusation came from the Belgian Social Democrats, and was raised here by Henry Charles. Peukert and the Gruppe Autonomie published a rebuttal of these allegations which appeared in the \"Anarchist\", which also accused Dave of being a spy. However, in February 1887 Reuss used the unwitting Peukert to track down Johann Neve, an arms smuggler, in Belgium, who was then arrested by the German police. .\n\nIn 1880, in Munich, he participated in an attempt to revive Adam Weishaupt's Bavarian Order of Illuminati. While in England, he became friends with William Wynn Westcott, the Supreme Magus of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia and one of the founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Westcott provided Reuss with a charter dated July 26, 1901 for the Swedenborgian Rite of Masonry and a letter of authorization dated February 24, 1902 to found a High Council in Germania of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. Gérard Encausse provided him with a charter dated June 24, 1901 designating him Special Inspector for the Martinist Order in Germany. In 1888, in Berlin, he joined with Leopold Engel of Dresden, Max Rahn and August Weinholz in another effort to revive the Illuminati Order. In 1895, he began to discuss the formation of Ordo Templi Orientis with Carl Kellner.\n\nThe discussions between Reuss and Kellner did not lead to any positive results at the time, allegedly because Kellner disapproved of Reuss's connections with Engel. According to Reuss, upon his final separation with Engel in June 1902, Kellner contacted him and the two agreed to proceed with the establishment of the Oriental Templar Order by seeking authorizations to work the various rites of high-grade Masonry.\n\nThe French occultist and physician Gérard Encausse (perhaps better known by his pen-name Papus) was one such contact. Although not a member of a regular Masonic order, he had founded two occult fraternities: the Martinist group, l'Ordre des Supérieurs Inconnus and the Rosicrucian Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix. In addition, he was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and a Bishop in a neo-Gnostic church, l'Église Gnostique de France. Encausse provided Reuss with a charter dated June 24, 1901 designating him Special Inspector for the Martinist order in Germany. He also assisted Reuss in the formation of the O.T.O. Gnostic Catholic Church by proclaiming the E.G.C. a \"child\" of l'Église Gnostique de France, which linked the E.G.C. to French neo-gnosticism.\n\nMeanwhile, Westcott assisted Reuss in contacting the English Masonic scholar, John Yarker (1833–1913). Along with his associates Franz Hartmann and Henry Klein, he activated the Masonic Rites of Memphis and Mizraim and a branch of the Scottish Rite in Germany with charters from Yarker. Reuss received letters-patent as a Sovereign Grand Inspector General 33° of the Cernau Scottish Rite from Yarker dated September 24, 1902. On the same date, Yarker appears to have issued a warrant to Reuss, Franz Hartmann and Henry Klein to operate a Sovereign Sanctuary 33°-95° of the Scottish, Memphis and Mizraim rites. The original document is not extant, but a transcript of this warrant was published in 1911 in Reuss's newsletter, The Oriflamme, which commenced publication in 1902. Yarker issued a charter confirming Reuss's authority to operate said rites on July 1, 1904; and Reuss published a transcript of an additional confirming charter dated June 24, 1905. Reuss and Kellner together prepared a brief manifesto for their Order in 1903, which was published the next year in \"The Oriflamme\".\n\nWhen Carl Kellner died in 1905, the leadership of the Academia Masonica of O.T.O. fell upon Reuss's shoulders, and he incorporated all his other organizations under its banner, developing the three degrees of the Academia Masonica, available to Masons only, into a coherent, self-contained initiatory system, open to both men and women. He promulgated a constitution for this new, enlarged O.T.O. on June 21, 1906 in London (his place of residence since January 1906) and the next month proclaimed himself Outer Head of the Order (O.H.O.). That same year he published \"Lingham-Yoni\", which was a German translation of Hargrave Jennings's work \"Phallism\", and issued a warrant to Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925, who was at the time the Secretary General of the German branch of the Theosophical Society), making him Deputy Grand Master of a subordinate O.T.O./Memphis/Mizraim Chapter and Grand Council called \"Mystica Aeterna\" in Berlin. Steiner went on to found the Anthroposophical Society in 1912, and ended his association with Reuss in 1914.\n\nOn June 24, 1908, Reuss attended Encausse's \"International Masonic and Spiritualist Conference\" in Paris. At this conference, Reuss raised Encausse to the X° of the O.T.O.'s Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica and gave him a patent to establish a \"Supreme Grand Council General of the Unified Rites of Antient and Primitive Masonry for the Grand Orient of France and its Dependencies at Paris. \" He possibly received in return some position of authority in the Église Catholique Gnostique. Reuss also appointed Dr. Arnold Krumm-Heller (Huiracocha, 1879–1949) as his official representative for Latin America.\n\nWhile living in London, Reuss became acquainted with Aleister Crowley. In 1910, he made Crowley a VII° of O.T.O. (because of Crowley's having been given the 33° by Don Jesus Medina in an irregular Scottish Rite lodge in Mexico City), and in 1912, he conferred upon him the IX° and appointed him National Grand Master General X° for the O.T.O. in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by charter dated June 1, 1912. Crowley's appointment included authority over an English language rite of the lower (Masonic) degrees of O.T.O. which was given the name Mysteria Mystica Maxima, or M∴M∴M∴. In 1913, Crowley issued a Constitution for the M∴M∴M∴ and the Manifesto of the M∴M∴M∴, which he subsequently redrafted and issued as Liber LII (52), the \"Manifesto of the O.T.O.\" In 1913, Crowley wrote Liber XV, the Gnostic Mass for Reuss's Gnostic Catholic Church. Crowley also dedicated his Mystery Play \"The Ship\" (1913) and a collection of poetry, \"The Giant's Thumb\" (1915) to Reuss. In 1913 he became Grand Master of the Rite of Memphis-Misraïm, a masonic group which previously included the revolutionaries Louis Blanc and Giuseppe Garibaldi amongst its ranks.\n\nIn 1914, at the outset of World War I, Reuss left England and returned to Germany. He worked briefly for the Red Cross in Berlin, then, in 1916, moved to Basle, Switzerland. While there, he established an \"Anational Grand Lodge and Mystic Temple\" of O.T.O. and the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light at Monte Verità, a utopian commune near Ascona founded in 1900 by Henri Oedenkoven and Ida Hofmann, which functioned as a center for the Progressive Underground. On January 22, 1917, Reuss published a manifesto for this Anational Grand Lodge, which was called \"Verità Mystica.\" On the same date, he published a \"Revised O.T.O. Constitution of 1917\" (based in a large part on Crowley's 1913 Constitution of the M.M.M.), with a \"Synopsis of Degrees\" and an abridgment of \"The Message of the Master Therion\" appended. Reuss held an \"Anational Congress for Organising the Reconstruction of Society on Practical Cooperative Lines\" at Monte Verità August 15–25, 1917. This Congress included readings of Crowley's poetry (on August 22) and a recitation of Crowley's Gnostic Mass (on August 24). On October 24, 1917, Reuss Chartered an O.T.O. Lodge, \"Libertas et Fraternitas\" in Zürich. This Lodge later placed itself under the Masonic jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge Alpina of Switzerland.\n\nIn 1918, Reuss published his German translation of Crowley's Gnostic Mass. In a note at the end of his translation of Liber XV, he referred to himself as, simultaneously, the Sovereign Patriarch and Primate of the Gnostic Catholic Church, and Gnostic Legate to Switzerland of the Église Gnostique Universelle, acknowledging Jean Bricaud (1881–1934) as Sovereign Patriarch of that church. The issuance of this document can be viewed as the birth of the Thelemic E.G.C. as an independent organization under the umbrella of O.T.O., with Reuss as its first Patriarch.\n\nReuss was clearly impressed with Thelema. Crowley's Gnostic Mass, which Reuss translated into German and had recited at his Anational Congress at Monte Verità, is an explicitly Thelemic ritual. In an undated letter to Crowley (received in 1917), Reuss reported excitedly that he had read \"The Message of the Master Therion\" to a gathering at Monte Verità, and that he was translating The Book of the Law into German. He added, \"Let this news encourage you! We live in your Work!!!\"\n\nReuss left Monte Verità some time before November 1918. On May 10, 1919, Reuss issued a \"Gauge of Amity\" document to Matthew McBlain Thomson, founder of the ill-fated \"American Masonic Federation.\" On September 18, 1919, Reuss was reconsecrated by Bricaud, thus receiving the \"Antioch Succession,\" and re-appointed as \"Gnostic Legate\" to Switzerland for Bricaud's Église Gnostique Universelle. In 1920, Oedenkoven and Hofmann abandoned Monte Verità in 1920 to establish a second colony in Brazil, and Reuss published a document titled \"The Program of Construction and the Guiding Principles of the Gnostic Neo-Christians: O.T.O.\"\n\nOn July 17, 1920, he attended the Congress of the \"World Federation of Universal Freemasonry\" in Zürich, which lasted several days. Reuss, with Bricaud's support, advocated the adoption of the religion of Crowley's Gnostic Mass as the \"official religion for all members of the World Federation of Universal Freemasonry in possession of the 18° of the Scottish Rite.\" Reuss's efforts in this regard were a failure, and he left the Congress after the first day. On May 10, 1921, Reuss issued X° Charters to Charles Stansfeld Jones and Heinrich Tränker to serve as Grand Masters for the US and Germany, respectively. On July 30, 1921, Reuss issued another \"Gauge of Amity\" document, this time to H. Spencer Lewis, founder of A.M.O.R.C., the San Jose, California based Rosicrucian organization. Reuss returned to Germany in September 1921, settling in Munich.\n\nThere is some reason to believe that Reuss suffered a stroke in the spring of 1920, but this is not entirely certain. Crowley wrote to W.T. Smith in March 1943: \"the late O.H.O., after his first stroke of paralysis, got into a panic about the work being carried on... He hastily issued honorary diplomas of the Seventh Degree to various people, some of whom had no right to anything at all and some of whom were only cheap crooks.\" Shortly after appointing him his Viceroy for Australia, Crowley appears to have corresponded with his friend Frank (Allan) Bennett and discussed with him his doubts about Reuss's continuing ability to effectively govern the Order.\n\nIt would appear that Reuss discovered the correspondence; he wrote Crowley an angry, defensive response on November 9, 1921, in which he appeared to distance himself and O.T.O. from Thelema, which, as shown above, he had previously embraced. Crowley replied to Reuss's letter on November 23, 1921, and stated in his letter, \"It is my will to be O.H.O. and Frater Superior of the Order and avail myself of your abdication—to proclaim myself as such.\" He signed the letter \"Baphomet O.H.O.\" Reuss's response is not extant, but Crowley recounts in his \"Confessions\" that Reuss \"resigned the office [of O.H.O.] in 1922 in my favour.\"\n\nHowever, it does not appear that Crowley waited for Reuss's response to assume his duties. In a diary entry for November 27, 1921, Crowley wrote: \"I have proclaimed myself O.H.O. Frater Superior of the Order of Oriental Templars.\" Reuss died on October 28, 1923. In a letter to Heinrich Tränker dated February 14, 1925, Crowley stated the following: \"Reuss was very uncertain in temper, and in many ways unreliable. In his last years he seems to have completely lost his grip, even accusing \"The Book of the Law\" of communistic tendencies, than which no statement could be more absurd. Yet it seems that he must have been to some extent correctly led, on account of his having made the appointments of yourself and Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones), and designating me in his last letter as his successor.\" In a letter to Charles Stansfeld Jones dated Sun in Capricorn, Anno XX (Dec. 1924 - Jan. 1925), Crowley said, \"in the O.H.O.'s last letter to me he invited me to become his successor as O.H.O. and Frater Superior.\" Reuss's letter designating Crowley his successor as O.H.O. has not been found, but no credible documentation has surfaced which would indicate that Reuss ever designated any alternative successor.\n\nReuss's writings include:\n\n"}

It brings in school and community groups to perform in the parks and/or take part in workshops or clinics. Types of groups include:\n\nDisneyland: Groups wishing to perform must send in a video of the group and pass an audition. Groups that do not pass may not perform in the park but may participate in a workshop.\nWalt Disney World: Groups wishing to perform must send in a video audition and picture with their application. All groups must purchase tickets through Disney Magic Music Days. They may perform in the parks or participate in a workshop.

All groups must purchase tickets through Disney Magic Music Days.\n\nDisneyland: Dance and Instrumental groups may perform at the Carnation Plaza Gardens stage located to the west of Sleeping Beauty Castle or at the Hollywood Backlot stage in Disney's California Adventure (DCA). On rare occasions the Small World mall area has been used for performances. Bands march down Disneyland's parade route as a pre-parade, a show directly before the parade. Bands might also march down DCA's performance corridor as a pre-parade or as a pre-show to the High School Musical Pep Rally.\n\nWalt Disney World: Orchestras may play on an outdoor stage at the marketplace, an outdoor shopping center. At Epcot, groups may also perform on a stage that is encased by a temporary \"shell\", this is located next to Innoventions West. The stage faces a small seating area with a control booth at the rear of the area. Magic Kingdom: Groups performing in the Magic Kingdom may have the opportunity to perform Cosmic Ray's Starlite Cafe in Tomorrowland. Groups may also perform at the Disney Springs stage in front of World of Disney. For those groups that are marching, the bands perform a march down the parade route at various times but may or may not coincide with one of Disney's actual parades. They may also march at Epcot around the World Showcase or Future World.\n\nHong Kong Disneyland: Vocal and dance groups may perform at the Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad station located in Main Street, U.S.A. inside the park.

During Christmastime, groups may also perform in the front lobby of Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel and Disney's Hollywood Hotel.\n\nDisneyland: Disneyland workshops are run by current and former Disneyland Cast Members who work professionally outside of Disneyland in the industry of the workshop they are running. Instrumental clinicians often conduct, arrange, direct, or perform music for major television and movie studios. Workshops are 90 minutes long and are designed to give students a taste of what professional studio musicians, singers, or dancers go through. Dance workshops are run like an audition. Instrumental workshops and Choral workshops cover multiple song segments from Disney animated and live action movies and are dubbed onto the film using a click track. Groups participating in a Workshop often receive a DVD of their work.\nWalt Disney World: WDW clinics are run by Disney World Cast Members. Some of these clinicians also work professionally in their field outside of Walt Disney World. Instrumental clinics are three hours long, cover one Disney medley piece, played back with Disney animation clips, much like a movie trailer. A Disney character, usually Mickey or Goofy, makes an appearance at the end of the workshop to thank the students for their work. Groups participating in a Workshop receive a DVD of their work.\n\nDisneyland: Directors receive any signs displayed in Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure which displayed their group's name, a plaque thanking the group for its efforts in arts, and a gift bag courtesy of the Yamaha corporation. Each participant receives a Disneyland specific Magic Music Days shirt.\nWalt Disney World: For the groups that perform in the Magic Music Days program, the participants might receive a couple souvenirs from Disney. Past items include a commemorative pin from the Magic Music Days (this pin is exclusively reserved for just the participants) and a shirt with the Magic Music Days logo on the front. The director/organization receive a banner indicating their groups performance for the \"World\", a plaque that they can display, or a small statue of Mickey Mouse all dressed up as a director.\n\nGroups participating in the program are taken through backstage areas of the parks that guests normally cannot see.

The group may have their picture taken by Disney and then either perform, take part in a workshop, or experience both.\nDisneyland: Participants enter backstage via access roads along the north side of the park, using changing rooms and the four-room rehearsal hall near the backside of Toontown. They can also catch glimpses of various warehouses and the adjacent Circle D Ranch where Disneyland's livestock are kept. During this time, they can purchase drinks or snacks through vending machines. \nEpcot: A Magic Music Days building is located behind the Italian pavilion. There, groups may change into their costumes/gowns, warm up, have rehearsals, or anything else the group may need to perform prior to appearing onstage. The groups may enter the park in two locations, one being located next to Italy, and the other between Imagination! and The Land Pavilions.\nMagic Kingdom: Students performing in the Magic Kingdom are escorted through a cast-members-only entrance next to Pirates of the Caribbean. From there, they make their way to changing locations to prepare for their performance.\n\n\nLudwig/Musser Percussion and Glaesel String Instruments from Conn-Selmer, Inc. are the Official Instrument providers of Disney Magic Music Days at the Walt Disney World Resort.
