It has been used for centuries by Italian shepherds to guard sheep from wolves. The literal English translation of the name is \"The dog of the shepherds of the Maremma and Abruzzese region\". The English name of the breed derives from that of the Maremma marshlands, where, until recently, shepherds, dogs and hundreds of thousands of sheep over-wintered, and where the breed is today abundant although sheep-farming has decreased substantially. The breed is widely employed in Abruzzo, where sheep herding remains vital to the rural economy and the wolf remains an active and protected predator. Similar breeds include the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, the Kuvasz of Hungary, the Tatra of Poland, the Cuvac of Slovakia and the Šarplaninac (although not white), with all of which it may share a common ancestor; and the Akbash Dog of Turkey.\n\nDescriptions of white sheep defense dogs are found in ancient Roman literature, in works such as those of Columella, Varro and Palladius. Similar dogs are depicted in numerous sculptures and paintings from Roman times to the present. Among the earliest is the series of large statues (two in Rome, one in Florence, one – the Duncombe Dog – in England) copied from a Hellenistic bronze from Pergamon.\nIconographic sources that have been identified as relevant to the history of the Maremmano include:\n\nThe first registration of the Maremmano in the Libro delle Origini Italiano of the Kennel Club Italiano, as it was then called, was of four dogs in 1898. There were no further registrations for many years. In 1940 there were 17 dogs registered. The first standard for the breed was drawn up in 1924 by Luigi Groppi and Giuseppe Solaro.\n\nUntil 1958 the Pastore Maremmano, or shepherd dog of the Maremma, and the Pastore Abruzzese, or shepherd dog of the Abruzzi, were regarded as separate breeds. A breeder's society for the Pastore Abruzzese was formed in 1950, and one for the Maremmano in 1953. On 1 January 1958 the breeds were unified by the ENCI, the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiano, the national dog association of Italy. The explanation given is that a \"natural fusion\" of the two types had occurred as a result of movement of the dogs due to transhumance of sheep flocks from one region to another, particularly after the unification of Italy. Until 1860, the mountains of the Abruzzo and the plains of the Maremma lay in different countries. Whilst some older publications refer to the Maremmano and Abruzzese as independent breeds combined to create the Maremmano-Abruzzese, it has been noted that the shorter haired Maremmano was only ever observed during the winter months when flocks were grazed on their winter pastures on the milder coastal Tuscany, whilst the supposedly longer bodied Abruzzese was only observed in the summer months when flocks were grazed in the Abruzzi mountains.\n\nAs sheep farming developed into an annual trek or transhumance from mountain grasslands of Abruzzo and Molise (and other parts of central Italy) south to lower pasture land in Puglia where sheep were over-wintered, the dogs came to play a central role in the centuries-old migration, an annual event vital to Abruzzese culture. Maremmano dogs continue to be widely used by Italian sheep farmers in areas where predation is common, such as the Apennines of central Italy and the open range land of national parks in Abruzzo. Besides their wide use in Italy, Maremma Sheepdogs are extensively used as livestock guardian dogs in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nThe Maremmano has a solid, muscular build, a thick white coat, a large head and a black nose. According to the breed standard, males should weigh and stand at the shoulder, while females weigh and stand . Some dogs may be considerably larger. The coat is long and thick; it is rough to the touch, and forms a thick collar around the neck. It should be solid white; some minor yellowing may be tolerated.\n\nSome divide the breed into various subtypes, largely based on small differences in physical attributes and with subtype names based on village and provincial names where the dogs may be found, e.g. the Maremmano, the Marsicano, the Aquilano, the Pescocostanzo, the Maiella, and the Peligno. However, biologists dispute this division, as well as over reliance on minor physical differences, as the dogs were bred over the centuries for their behavioral characteristics as flock guardians.\n\nThe traditional use of the Maremma sheepdog is as a guardian for the protection of sheep flocks against wolves. Columella, writing in the first century AD, recommends white dogs for this purpose, as the shepherd can easily distinguish them from the wolf, while Varro suggests that white dogs have a \"lion-like aspect\" in the dark. The dogs work in groups; three or four dogs are an adequate defense against wolves and stray dogs. Their function is mostly one of dissuasion, actual physical combat with the predator being relatively rare. Nevertheless, working dogs may be fitted with a \"roccale\" (or \"vreccale\"), a spiked iron collar which protects the neck in combat. The ears of working dogs are normally cropped.\n\nDogs used for flock protection are placed among the sheep as young puppies – no more than 40 days old – so that they bond with them; human contact is kept to the indispensable minimum. If there are already guardian dogs in the flock, the puppy imitates and learns from their behaviour. The traditional use of the Maremmano is with sheep, but the dogs can form a similar bond with cows and have been used to protect range cattle. A small number have been used since 2006 on Middle Island, off Warrnambool, in Victoria, Australia, to protect a small population of the Little Penguin (\"Eudyptula minor\") against foxes.\n"}

{"id": "1802400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802400", "title": "Phantasm (film)", "text": "Phantasm (film)\n\nPhantasm is a 1979 American science fantasy horror film directed, written, photographed, and edited by Don Coscarelli. The first film in the \"Phantasm\" franchise, it introduces the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), a supernatural and malevolent undertaker who turns the dead of Earth into dwarf zombies to be sent to his planet and used as slaves. He is opposed by a young boy, Mike (Michael Baldwin), who tries to convince his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) and family friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister) of the threat.\n\n\"Phantasm\" was a locally financed independent film; the cast and crew were mostly amateurs and aspiring professionals. Though initial reviews were mixed in regards to the dreamlike, surreal narrative and imagery, later reception was more positive and the film became a cult classic. It has appeared on several critics' lists of best horror films, and it has been cited as an influence on later horror series. It was followed by four sequels: \"Phantasm II\" (1988), \"\" (1994), \"\" (1998) and \"\" (2016).\n\nThe film begins at Morningside Cemetery, where during sexual intercourse Tommy is stabbed by the Lady in Lavender (actually the Tall Man in another form). At the funeral, Tommy's friends, Jody and Reggie, believe he committed suicide. Jody's younger brother, Mike, who secretly has been observing the funeral, witnesses a Tall Man, the Morningside mortician, lift Tommy's 500-pound casket into his hearse instead of completing the burial.\n\nLater, Jody is seduced by the Lady in Lavender and taken to the cemetery to have sex. However, the two are interrupted by Mike, who has been following Jody and has been driven out of his hiding place by a short, hooded figure. Mike tries to tell Jody about the hooded figure, but Jody dismisses the story. Mike investigates further. At the mausoleum, Mike narrowly avoids a silver sphere flying through the air. He is accosted by a caretaker but escapes after the sphere impales itself on the caretaker's skull and drills into his brain. Mike then flees the Tall Man, cutting off his fingers. Taking one of the fingers with him, Mike escapes the mausoleum.\n\nThe finger is enough to convince Jody about Mike's stories. Reggie, who witnesses the finger-turned-insect attack Mike, joins the brothers in their suspicions. Jody goes to the cemetery alone but is chased away by dwarves and a seemingly driverless hearse. He is rescued by Mike in Jody's Hemicuda. Running the hearse off the road, they discover that it was driven by one of the hooded figures, a re-animated and shrunk Tommy, whom they hide in Reggie's ice cream truck.\n\nReggie and Jody resolve to defeat the Tall Man, while Mike is hidden at an antique store owned by Jody's friends Sally and Sue. There, he discovers an antique photograph of the Tall Man and insists on being taken home. On the way, Mike, Sally and Sue come across the overturned ice cream truck. They are attacked by a mob of hooded dwarves. Mike manages to escape, presuming the girls and Reggie dead.\n\nJody goes to the mausoleum to kill the Tall Man. Mike, who is locked in his room for safety but escapes, runs into the Tall Man, who was waiting for him outside his front door. He kidnaps Mike in a hearse, but Mike escapes and causes the hearse to strike a pole and explode. Looking for Jody in the mausoleum, Mike is attacked by the silver sphere until Jody destroys it with a shotgun. Together with Reggie, they enter a brightly lit room, which is filled with canisters containing more dwarves. Mike catches a brief glimpse through a strange portal, seeing a red, hot planet where the dwarves are toiling as slaves.\n\nA sudden power outage separates the trio. Left alone in the room, Reggie activates the portal, creating a powerful vacuum from which he narrowly escapes. In the ensuing storm, Reggie is stabbed by the Lady in Lavender while Jody and Mike flee and the mausoleum vanishes. Jody devises a plan to trap the Tall Man in a deserted mine shaft. The Tall Man attacks Mike at home, chases him outside, where he eventually falls into the mine shaft and is buried under an avalanche of rocks triggered by Jody.\n\nAfter this, Mike wakes up in his bed, still worried about the Tall Man. Reggie, still alive, tells Mike that he had a nightmare, that Jody died in a car wreck and proposes a road trip. When Mike enters his bedroom to pack, the Tall Man appears and hands crash through the bedroom mirror, pulling Mike inside.\n\n\nFilm scholar John Kenneth Muir interprets the film as being about mourning and death. Many of the film's fans are young boys, aged 10–13. According to Angus Scrimm, the film \"gives expression to all their insecurities and fears\". Scrimm states that the theme of loss and how, by fantasizing about death, the young protagonist deals with the deaths in his family drives the story. Coscarelli identifies it as a \"predominately male story\" that young teens respond to. Scrimm explains the popularity of the film as fans responding to themes of death, and the Tall Man himself represents death. Muir describes the Tall Man as embodying childhood fears of adults and states that the Tall Man wins in the end because dreams are the only place where death can be defeated. American views of death are another theme:\nDreams and surrealism are also an important part of \"Phantasm\". Marc Savlov of the \"Austin Chronicle\" compares \"Phantasm\" to the works of Alejandro Jodorowsky and Luis Buñuel in terms of weirdness. Savlov describes the film as existentialist horror and \"a truly bizarre mix of outlandish horror, cheapo gore, and psychological mindgames that purposefully blur the line between waking and dreaming.\" Gina McIntyre of the \"Los Angeles Times\" describes the film as surreal, creepy, and idiosyncratic. Muir writes that \"Phantasm\" \"purposely inhabits the half-understood sphere of dreams\" and takes place in the imagination of a disturbed boy.\n\nAfter seeing the audience reaction to jump scares in \"Kenny and Company\", writer-director Don Coscarelli decided to do a horror film as his next project. His previous films had not performed well, and he heard that horror films were always successful; branching into horror allowed him to combine his childhood love of the genre with better business prospects. The original idea was inspired by \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" by Ray Bradbury. Coscarelli had initially sought to adapt the story into a film, but the license had already been sold. The theme of a young boy's difficulty convincing adults of his fears was influenced by \"Invaders from Mars\" (1953). Dario Argento's \"Suspiria\" (1977) and its lack of explanations was another influence on Coscarelli. The soundtrack was influenced by Goblin and Mike Oldfield. The synthesizers were so primitive that it was difficult to repeat sounds. When writing the film's conclusion, Coscarelli intentionally wanted to shock audiences and \"send people out of the theater with a bang.\"\n\nThere were no accountants on the set, but Coscarelli estimates the budget at $300,000. Funding for the film came in part from Coscarelli's father, who was credited as the film's producer; additional funding came from doctors and lawyers. His mother designed some of the special effects, costumes, and make-up. The cast and crew were composed mainly of friends and aspiring professionals. Due to their inexperience, they did not realize that firing blanks could be dangerous; Coscarelli's jacket caught fire from a shotgun blank. Casting was based on previous films that Coscarelli directed, and he created roles for those actors. Because he could not afford to hire an editor or cameraman, Coscarelli did these duties himself.\n\nFilming was done on weekends and sometimes lasted for 20 hours over the course of more than a year. Reggie Bannister described the production as \"flying by the seat of our pants.\" The actors would be called to perform their scenes and picked up as soon as they were available. Bannister did many of his own stunts. Though set in Oregon, shooting took place primarily in the San Fernando Valley in Chatsworth, California. The script changed often during production, and Bannister says that he never saw a completed copy of it; instead, they worked scene-by-scene and used improvisation. The script was characterized by Coscarelli as \"barely linear\". While it contained the basic concepts of the completed film, the script was unfocused and rewritten during filming. The spheres came from one of Coscarelli's nightmares, but the original idea did not involve drilling. Will Greene, an elderly metal-worker, fashioned the iconic spheres, but he never got to see the finished film, as he died before the film was released. The black 1971 Plymouth Barracuda was used because Coscarelli had known someone in high school who drove one; he realized that he could get his hands on one by using it in the film.\n\nPost-production took another six to eight months. The first test screening was poorly-received due to the film's length; Coscarelli says that he erred in adding too much character development, which needed to be edited out. \"Phantasm\"s fractured dream logic was due in part to the extensive editing. During shooting, they did not have a clear idea of the ending. Several endings were filmed, and one of them was re-used in \"\". Coscarelli attributed the freedom to choose from among these endings to his independent financing.\n\nTo solicit outside opinions, Coscarelli paid an audience to watch an early cut of the film. Although Coscarelli called the result \"a disaster\", he was encouraged by the audience's reactions to the film. The financial success of \"Halloween\" released the prior year convinced vice-president of marketing at AVCO Embassy Pictures, Robert Rehme, to purchase \"Phantasm\" for distribution. The original theatrical release was March 28th, 1979. It grossed $11,988,469 at the box office. MGM released \"Phantasm\" on laserdisc in November 1995 and on DVD in August 1998. Anchor Bay Entertainment re-released it on DVD on April 10, 2007.\n\nIn late 2015, Coscarelli showed a work-in-progress 4K resolution restoration of \"Phantasm\" (called \"Phantasm: Remastered\") at the Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival. It was supervised by Coscarelli at Bad Robot Productions. Bad Robot became involved when director J. J. Abrams, a fan of the series, requested a screening of the film. Coscarelli told him that he did not have a high-quality print, but Abrams volunteered the use of his technicians for a restoration. The completed restoration premiered at SXSW in March 2016. \"Phantasm: Remastered\" was released in limited theaters on September 24, 2016, and was released on Blu-ray on December 6, 2016.\n\nCharles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" deemed the film \"a smooth and terrifically impressive technical achievement, a sort of \"jeu de spook\" with all manner of eerie and shocking special effects.\" In a mostly negative review, critic Roger Ebert described the film as \"a labor of love, if not a terrifically skillful one\" but admitted \"Phantasm\" had a good visual style and sense of pacing. Trevor Johnston of \"Time Out\" called the film \"a surprisingly shambolic affair whose moments of genuine invention stand out amid the prevailing incompetence.\" Dave Kehr of the \"Chicago Reader\" described it as \"spotty\" and \"effective here and there\", though he praised Coscarelli's raw ability. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" compared it to a ghost story told by a bright, imaginative 8-year-old; he concluded that it is \"thoroughly silly and endearing\". \"Variety\" gave it a positive review that highlighted the use of both horror and humor. Tim Pulleine (\"Monthly Film Bulletin\") described the film as a \"dilapidated z-movie\" with \"singularly unconvincing apparitions and contraptions\" and that the film did not have \"anything resembling a coherent plot in the course of all the fumblingly juvenile malarkey\".\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Phantasm\" holds a 73% approval rating based on 45 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.51/10. The consensus reads: \"\"Phantasm: Remastered\" adds visual clarity to the first installment in one of horror's most enduring -- and endearingly idiosyncratic -- franchises.” Kim Newman of \"Empire\" called it \"an incoherent but effective horror picture\" that \"deliberately makes no sense\" and rates it four out of five stars. Scott Weinberg of Fearnet stated the acting is \"indie-style raw\" and special effects are sometimes poor, but the originality and boldness make up for it. Steve Barton of Dread Central rated it five out of five stars and said the film is a masterpiece and \"one hell of a scary film\". Bloody Disgusting rated the film four out of five stars and said the film is \"truly original\" and \"imbues in its viewers is a profound sense of dread\". Author John Kenneth Muir called the film striking, distinctive, and original. Muir stated that the film has become a classic, and the Tall Man is a horror film icon.\n\nThe film was rated #25 on the cable channel Bravo!'s list of \"The 100 Scariest Movie Moments\". It is also placed #75 in Time Out London's 100 best horror films. Drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs included it at #20 in his \"25 Scariest DVDs Ever\" list. UGO placed the film (and the Tall Man) at #7 out of 11 in its \"Top Terrifying Supernatural Moments\". \"Phantasm\" has become a cult film; Coscarelli attributes its cult following to nostalgia and its lack of answers, as repeated viewings can leave fans with different interpretations. \"USA Today\" described three characteristics that make it a cult film: \"the touching portrayal of two brothers in danger, an iconic villain in The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) and a floating metallic sphere that's a death-dealing weapon.\"\n\nThe name of \"\" villain Captain Phasma was chosen as a reference to \"Phantasm\". Director Abrams said, \"Phasma I named because of the amazing chrome design that came from Michael Kaplan's wardrobe team. It reminded me of the ball in \"Phantasm\", and I just thought, Phasma sounds really cool.\"\n\n\"USA Today\" quoted Jovanka Vuckovic, editor in chief of \"Rue Morgue\", as stating that \"Supernatural\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984), and \"One Dark Night\" (1983) were all influenced by \"Phantasm\". \"Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man\" identifies the Tall Man as an influence on the internet-based character Slender Man.\n\nSwedish Death Metal band Entombed performed a cover of the Phantasm theme in their 1990 song 'Left Hand Path'.\n\nThe 1997 computer game Blood paid homage to the film in the first level of the first episode (E1M1) titled Cradle to the Grave. This map takes place in the Morningside Mortuary. \n\nIn the 1998 sequel Blood II: The Chosen there is a weapon called The Orb that acts as the metal spheres by flying into the head of the enemy and drilling out their brain, spraying blood everywhere. \n\nThe 2014 song \"Headless Ritual\" from Army of the Pharaohs on the album \"In Death Reborn\" was inspired by the flying death ball from the film.\n\nDon Coscarelli won the Special Jury Award in 1979 at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival, and the film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film in 1980.\n\n\n"}

Fighting under the name \"Bombardier Billy Wells\", he was British and British Empire Champion from 1911 until 1919, defending his title fourteen times. In 1911 he became the first Heavyweight to win the Lonsdale Belt, which had been introduced for British champions at all weights in 1909.\n\nWells, who was and was between , fought with an orthodox style.\n\nWells was born at 250 Cable Street, Stepney, in the East End of London. He was the eldest of five brothers and was one of nine children. His parents were William Thomas Wells, a musician, and Emily Rhoda Farrier, a laundress. He attended Broad Street elementary school, Queensbury until about the age of twelve, then becoming a messenger boy. He began to box as an amateur during this period.\n\nIn 1906, Wells joined the Royal Artillery as a gunner. He was posted to Rawalpindi where he boxed in divisional and all-India championships, with great success. He was promoted to a bombardier, and began training full-time with the help of a civilian coach. It became apparent that Wells was good enough to make a living from boxing, so in 1910, he bought himself out of the army and returned to Britain. This was at a time when boxing was becoming very popular as a spectator sport, in Britain and elsewhere.\n\nWells had his first professional fight on 8 June 1910, against Gunner Joe Mills, winning on points over six rounds. In his first eight fights he recorded seven wins and one defeat. In his next fight he fought for the British Heavyweight Title, at the National Sporting Club, Covent Garden, London. The fight was in April 1911 against Iron (William) Hague, the holder, and Wells won by a knockout in the sixth round of twenty.\n\nWells was matched to fight the current world heavyweight champion, Jack Johnson, in London in October 1911, but religious opponents of excessive prize money, led by Baptist minister Frederick Brotherton Meyer, and opponents of contests between the races, caused the fight to be cancelled by Winston Churchill, who was then Home Secretary. A 'colour bar' remained in British boxing until 1947.\n\nIn December 1911, Wells fought Fred Storbeck at Covent Garden for the British Empire Heavyweight Title, scoring a knockout in the eleventh round to gain his second title in one year.\n\nIn June 1913, Wells fought the extremely talented Frenchman Georges Carpentier for the European Heavyweight Title. The bout was held in Ghent, Belgium, and Wells lost by a knockout in the fourth round.\n\nWells defended his British heavyweight title three times in 1913, and then in December of the same year, he had a rematch with Carpentier for his European title. The bout was held at Covent garden, but again Carpentier won, this time by a knockout in the first round.\n\nWells continued to box and successfully defend his British heavyweight title, even after the start of World War I. In May 1915, Wells joined up for military service (in the Welch Regiment) and was later made a sergeant. He continued to box until the end of 1916, and in 1917 was sent to France to organize physical training amongst the troops.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Wells resumed his boxing career. His fourteenth defence of his British heavyweight title, and of his British Empire title was against Joe Beckett, a boxer whom he had beaten on points two months previously. The bout was held in February 1919, in Holborn, London, and Beckett won by a knockout in the fifth round to take Wells’ titles.\n\nWells then had five more bouts, winning them all, before having a rematch against Beckett in May 1920. The bout was held at Olympia, Kensington, but again Wells was knocked out, this time in the third round. Wells continued to fight, having eight [?] more bouts, winning five and losing six. His last fight was in April 1925.\n\nWells was the third person to fill the role of the \"gongman\" - the figure seen striking the gong in the introduction to J. Arthur Rank films.\n\nIn 1911, he published a book, \"Modern Boxing: a Practical Guide to Present Day Methods\".\n\nOn 7 September 1912, Wells married Ellen Kilroy, the daughter of a publican. They had five children before eventually parting.\n\nIn 1923, he published the book, \"Physical energy: Showing how physical and mental energy may be developed by means of the practice of boxing\", Publisher: T.W. Laurie.\n\nThe Lonsdale Belt that Wells won was the original heavyweight belt and was crafted from 22 carat gold unlike later belts. The belt was kept at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, South East London, but is now at Larkhill, Salisbury following the move of the home of the Royal Artillery.\n\nHe lived in Ealing, London and died there on 11 June 1967, aged 77. His ashes were laid to rest in the crypt of St. Mary's parish church in Hanwell, west London.\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, Shaikh did not provide his FBI contact Steven Butler with any information about the two; Butler claims that the names Nawaf and Khalid were only mentioned in casual conversation as two students who were boarders in his house. Butler later asked Shaikh for their surnames, but was not given them. He was not told they were pursuing flight training.

He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nJones was born in the small farming community of Niagara in Henderson County, Kentucky, the youngest of 10 children in a sharecropper's family. His father was an old-time fiddle player, and his mother was a ballad singer and herself adept on the concertina. His first instrument was guitar. Ramona Jones was his wife and one of several women who began to gain some recognition in a musical form long dominated by men and Grandpa's wife and musical partner of over thirty years. Ramona first started playing the mandolin when she was six or seven years old. Jones spent his teenage years in Akron, Ohio, where he began singing country music tunes on a radio show on WJW. In 1931, Jones joined the Pine Ridge String Band, which provided the musical accompaniment for the very popular Lum and Abner show. By 1935 his pursuit of a musical career took him to WBZ (AM) radio in Boston, Massachusetts, where he met musician/songwriter Bradley Kincaid, who gave him the nickname \"Grandpa Jones\" when he was 22 years old, because of his off-stage grumpiness at early-morning radio shows. Jones liked the name and decided to create a stage persona based around it. Later in life, he lived in Mountain View, Arkansas.\n\nPerforming as Grandpa Jones, he played the guitar or banjo, yodeled, and sang mostly old-time ballads. By 1937, Jones had made his way to West Virginia, where Cousin Emmy taught Jones the art of the clawhammer style of banjo playing, which gave a rough backwoods flavor to his performances. First experience playing music in public came at the age of 11 or thereabouts The music of the WLS Barn Dance in Chicago was a major influence on Louis, as were the Jimmie Rodger’s records his sister brought home. He won a contest which is featured as singer and host in 1929, \"I won fifty dollars in ten dollar gold pieces, and of course I went right out and brought a better guitar!\" Wonder Hall, “The Red Headed Music Maker” (famous for “It Ain’t gonna Rain No More” The winning songs were “Going Back To Texas” and “ My Dear Old Southern Home.” In 1942, Jones joined WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was there that he met fellow Kentuckian Merle Travis. In 1943, they made their recording debuts together for Syd Nathan's upstart King Records. Jones was making records under his own name for King by 1944 and had his first hit with \"It's Raining Here This Morning.\"\n\nHis recording career was put on hold when he enlisted in the United States Army during World War II. Discharged in 1946, he recorded again for King. Through 1946-1949, when he and several Opry cast members (Clyde Moody and Chubby Wise among them) were invited to become a part of the burgeoning world of television by Washington D.C. entrepreneur Connie B Gay, and became a cast member at the Old Dominion Barn Dance, broadcast over WRVA in Richmond, Virginia. In March 1946, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee and started performing on the Grand Ole Opry. He married Ramona Riggins on October 14, 1946. As an accomplished performer herself, she would take part in his performances. Jones' vaudeville humor was a bridge to television. His more famous songs include \"T For Texas,\" \"Are You From Dixie,\" \"Night Train To Memphis,\" \"Mountain Dew,\" and \"Eight More Miles To Louisville.\"\n\nIn the fall of 1968, Jones became a charter cast member on the long-running television show \"Hee Haw\", often responding to the show's skits with his trademark phrase \"Outrageous.\" He also played banjo, by himself or with banjo player David \"Stringbean\" Akeman. A musical segment featured in the early years had Jones and \"his lovely wife Ramona\" singing while ringing bells held in their hands and feet. A favorite skit had off-camera cast members ask, \"Hey Grandpa, what's for supper?\" in which he would describe a delicious, country-style meal, often in a rhyming, talking blues style. Sometimes he would describe something not so good; i.e. \"Because you were bad, thawed out TV dinners!\"\n\nA resident of rural Ridgetop, Tennessee, outside Nashville, he was a neighbor and friend of fellow musician David \"Stringbean\" Akeman. On the morning of November 11, 1973, Jones discovered the bodies of Akeman and his wife, who had been murdered during the night by robbers. Jones testified at the trial of the killers, his testimony helping to secure a conviction.\n\nIn 1978, Jones was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. His autobiography, \"Everybody's Grandpa: Fifty Years Behind The Mike\" was published in 1984.\n\nIn January 1998, Jones suffered two strokes after his second show performance at the Grand Ole Opry. He died at 7:00 p.m. Central Time on February 19, 1998 at the McKendree Village Home Health Center in Hermitage, Tennessee, at age 84. He was buried in the Luton Memorial Methodist Church cemetery in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.\n\nJones recorded for several labels, including RCA Victor, King Records and Monument.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1802422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802422", "title": "Electronic article surveillance", "text": "Electronic article surveillance\n\nElectronic article surveillance is a technological method for preventing shoplifting from retail stores, pilferage of books from libraries or removal of properties from office buildings. Special tags are fixed to merchandise or books. These tags are removed or deactivated by the clerks when the item is properly bought or checked out. At the exits of the store, a detection system sounds an alarm or otherwise alerts the staff when it senses active tags. Some stores also have detection systems at the entrance to the restrooms that sound an alarm if someone tries to take unpaid merchandise with them into the restroom. For high-value goods that are to be manipulated by the patrons, wired alarm clips called spider wrap may be used instead of tags.\n\nSurveillance tags that could be attached to items in stores were first invented by Arthur Minasy in 1966. Initially the concept of pilferage becoming a real concern to retailers started in 1964 when a requirement was raised by a retailer in Ohio after he faced pilferage in his store. Thereafter lots of research started happening and today it has reached a stage where visible deterrence have moved on to where a retailer does not even have to install pedestals in a store.\n\nThere are several major types of electronic article surveillance systems:\n\nThese new types of systems have caught on lately as there are no visible pedestals or hindrance in the store facade. These systems are installed below the floor and dropped from the ceiling, and can then protect merchandise of retailers from being stolen as the entire range of door is covered. Various studies and researches have been done into making this technology powerful and effective. There are site conditions and other parameters which enable them to be successfully installed but often it has now been noted that malls insist on concealed system as a mandate to increase the shopping experience- for example a part of Dubai Mall in United Arab Emirates do not allow any visible systems. Concealed Systems will be the way to go for the future.\n\nThese tags are made of a strip of amorphous metal (metglas) which has a very low magnetic saturation value. Except for permanent tags, this strip is also lined with a strip of ferromagnetic material with a moderate coercive field (magnetic \"hardness\"). Detection is achieved by sensing harmonics and sum or difference signals generated by the non-linear magnetic response of the material under a mixture of low-frequency (in the 10 Hz to 1000 Hz range) magnetic fields.\n\nWhen the ferromagnetic material is magnetized, it biases the amorphous metal strip into saturation, where it no longer produces harmonics. Deactivation of these tags is therefore done with magnetization. Activation requires demagnetization.\n\nThe EM systems are suitable for libraries to protect books and media. In the retail segment, unlike AM and RF, EM can protect small or round items and products with foil packaging or metal objects, like cosmetics, baby milk cans, medicines, DIY tools, homeware etc. EM systems can also detect objects placed in foil bags or in metal briefcases.\n\nA further application is the Intellectual property (IP) protection against theft: Security paper with embedded microwires, which is used to detect confidential documents if they are removed from a building.\n\nThese are similar to magnetic tags in that they are made of two strips: a strip of magnetostrictive, ferromagnetic amorphous metal and a strip of a magnetically semi-hard metallic strip, which is used as a biasing magnet (to increase signal strength) and to allow deactivation. These strips are not bound together but free to oscillate mechanically.\n\nAmorphous metals are used in such systems due to their good \"magnetoelastic coupling\", which implies that they can efficiently convert magnetic energy into mechanical vibrations.\n\nThe detectors for such tags emit periodic tonal bursts at about 58 kHz, the same as the resonance frequency of the amorphous strips. This causes the strip to vibrate longitudinally by magnetostriction, and it continues to oscillate after the burst is over. The vibration causes a change in magnetization in the amorphous strip, which induces an AC voltage in the receiver antenna. If this signal meets the required parameters (correct frequency, repetition, etc.), the alarm is activated.\n\nWhen the semi-hard magnet is magnetized, the tag is activated. The magnetized strip makes the amorphous strip respond much more strongly to the detectors, because the DC magnetic field given off by the strip offsets the magnetic anisotropy within the amorphous metal. The tag can also be deactivated by demagnetizing the strip, making the response small enough so that it will not be detected by the detectors.\n\nAM tags are three dimensional plastic tags, much thicker than electro-magnetic strips and are thus seldom used for books. However, they are relatively inexpensive and have better detection rates (fewer false positives and false negatives) than electro-magnetic tags.\nCalled Emtag by B&G International, this type of tag is often attached to the inside of a plastic surround permanently attached to the power cords of hand tools and equipment.\n\nThese tags are essentially an LC tank circuit (L for inductor, C for capacitator) that has a resonance peak anywhere from 1.75 MHz to 9.5 MHz. The standard frequency for retail use is 8.2 MHz. Sensing is achieved by sweeping around the resonant frequency and detecting the dip.\n\nDeactivation for 8.2 MHz label tags is typically achieved using a deactivation pad. In the absence of such a device, labels can be rendered inactive by punching a hole, or by covering the circuit with a metallic label, a \"detuner\". The deactivation pad functions by partially destroying the capacitor. Though this sounds violent, in reality, both the process and the result are unnoticeable to the naked eye. The deactivator causes a micro short circuit in the label. This is done by submitting the tag to a strong electromagnetic field at the resonant frequency, which induces voltages exceeding the capacitor's breakdown voltage.\n\nIn terms of deactivation, Radio Frequency is the most efficient of the 3 technologies (RF, EM, AM – there are no microwave labels) given that the reliable \"remote\" deactivation distance can be up to . It also benefits the user in terms of running costs, since the RF de-activator only activates to send a pulse when a circuit is present. Both EM and AM deactivation units are on all the time and consume considerably more electricity. The reliability of \"remote\" deactivation (i.e. non-contact or non-proximity deactivation) capability makes for a fast and efficient throughput at the checkout.\n\nEfficiency is an important factor when choosing an overall EAS solution given that time lost attempting to deactivate labels can be an important drag of cashier productivity as well as customer satisfaction if unwanted alarms are caused by tags that have not been effectively deactivated at the point of sale.\n\nDeactivation of RF labels is also dependent on the size of the label and the power of the deactivation pad (the larger the label, the greater the field it generates for deactivation to take place. For this reason very small labels can cause issues for consistent deactivation). It is common to find RF deactivation built into barcode flat and vertical scanners at the POS in food retail especially in Europe and Asia where RF EAS technology has been the standard for nearly a decade. In apparel retail deactivation usually takes the form of flat pads of approx. 30x30 cm.\n\nThese permanent tags are made of a non-linear element (a diode) coupled to one microwave and one electrostatic antenna. At the exit, one antenna emits a low-frequency (about 100 kHz) field, and another one emits a microwave field. The tag acts as a mixer re-emitting a combination of signals from both fields. This modulated signal triggers the alarm. These tags are permanent and somewhat costly. They are mostly used in clothing stores and have practically been withdrawn from use.\n\nSource tagging is the application of EAS security tags at the source, the supplier or manufacturer, instead of at the retail side of the chain. For the retailer, source tagging eliminates the labor expense needed to apply the EAS tags themselves, and reduces the time between receipt of merchandise and when the merchandise is ready for sale. For the supplier, the main benefit is the preservation of the retail packaging aesthetics by easing the application of security tags within product packaging. Source tagging allows the EAS tags to be concealed and more difficult to remove.\n\nThe high-speed application of EAS labels, suited for commercial packaging processes, was perfected via modifications to standard pressure-sensitive label applicators and was developed and introduced by Craig Patterson, initially for Hewlett Packard print cartridges. Today, consumer goods are source tagged at high speeds with the EAS label incorporated into the packaging or the product itself.\n\nThe most common source tags are AM strips and 8.2 MHz radio frequency labels. Most manufacturers use both when source tagging in the USA. In Europe there is little demand for AM tagging given that the Food and Department Store environments are dominated by RF technology.\n\nOne significant problem from source tagging is something called \"tag pollution\" caused when non-deactivated tags carried around by customers cause unwanted alarms, decreasing the effectiveness and integrity of the EAS system. The problem is that no store has more than one system. Therefore, if a store actually has an anti-shoplifting system to deactivate a label they will only deactivate the one that is part of their system. If a store does not use an EAS system, they will not deactivate any tags at all. This is often the reason why people trigger an alarm entering a store, which can cause great frustration for both customers and staff. The problem is most evident in shopping malls where customers wander between stores.\n\nEAS systems can provide a solid deterrent against casual theft. The occasional shoplifter, not being familiar with these systems and their mode of operation, will either get caught by them, or preferably, will be dissuaded from attempting any theft in the first place.\n\nInformed shoplifters are conscious of how tags can be removed or deactivated. A common method of defeating RF tags is the use of so-called booster bags. These are typically large paper bags that have been lined with multiple layers of aluminium foil to effectively shield the RF label from detection, much like a Faraday cage. A similar situation would be the loss of signal that a cell phone suffers inside an elevator: The electro-magnetic, or radio, waves are effectively blocked, reducing the ability to send or receive information.\n\nHowever, they may miss some tags or be unable to remove or deactivate all of them, especially if concealed or integrated tags are used. As a service to retailers, many manufacturers integrate security tags in the packaging of their products, or even inside the product itself, though this is rare and not especially desirable either for the retailer or the manufacturer. The practical totality of EAS labels are discarded with the product packaging. This is of particular application in everyday items that consumers might carry on their person to avoid the inconvenience of potentially live reactivated EAS tags when walking in and out of retail stores.\n\nHard tags, typically used for clothing or ink tags, known as benefit denial tags, may reduce the rate of tag manipulation. Also, shoplifters deactivating or detaching tags may be spotted by the shop staff.\n\nShoplifting tools are illegal in many jurisdictions, and can, in any case, serve as evidence against the perpetrators. Hence, informed shoplifters, although they decrease their risk of being caught by the EAS, expose themselves to much greater judicial risks if they get caught with tools, booster bags, or while trying to remove tags, as this shows intent to steal.\n\nThe possession of shoplifting tools (e.g. lined bags or wire cutters to cut bottle tags) can lead to the suspect being arrested for suspicion of theft or \"Going equipped for stealing, etc.\" within the UK judicial system.\n\nIn summary, while even the least expensive EAS systems will catch most occasional shoplifters, a broader range of measures are still required for an effective response that can protect profits without impeding sales.\n\nTags can be equipped with a built-in alarm which sounds when the tag detects tampering or unauthorized removal from the store. The tag not only triggers the store's electronic article surveillance system, but also sounds an alarm attached to the merchandise. The local alarm continues to sound for several minutes after leaving the store, attracting attention to the shopper carrying the merchandise.\n\nA single EAS detector, suitable for a small shop, is accessible to all retail stores, and should form a part of any coherent loss or profit protection system.\n\nDisposable tags cost a matter of cents and may have been embedded during manufacture. More sophisticated systems are available, which are more difficult to circumvent. These solutions tend to be product category specific as in the case of high value added electronics and consumables; consequently they are more expensive. Examples are \"Safers\", transparent secure boxes that completely enclose the article to be protected, Spiders that wrap around packaging and Electronic Merchandise Security Systems that allow phones and tablets to be used securely in the store before purchase. All of these require specific detachers or electronic keys at the point-of-sale desk. They have the advantages of being reusable, strong visual deterrents to potential theft.\n\nExcept for microwave, the detection rate for all these tags depends on their orientation relative to the detection loops. For a pair of planar loops forming a Helmholtz coil, magnetic field lines will be approximately parallel in their center. Orienting the tag so that no magnetic flux from the coils crosses them will prevent detection, as the tag won't be coupled to the coils. This shortcoming, documented in the first EAS patents, can be solved by using multiple coils or by placing them in another arrangement such as a figure-of-eight. Sensitivity will still be orientation-dependent but detection will be possible at all orientations.\n\nA detacher is used to remove re-usable hard tags. The type of detacher used will depend on the type of tag. There are a variety of detachers available, with the majority using powerful magnets. Any store that uses an anti-shoplifting system and has a detacher should take care to keep it secured such that it cannot be removed. Some detachers actually have security tags inside them, to alert store personnel of them being removed from (or being brought into) the store. With increasing prevalence, stores have metal detectors at the entrance that can warn against the presence of booster bags or detachers.\n\nDeactivation of magnetic tags is achieved by straightforward magnetization using a strong magnet. Magneto-acoustic tags require demagnetization. However, sticking a powerful magnet on them will bias disposable magnetic tags and prevent resonance in magneto-acoustic tags. Similarly, sticking a piece of metal, such as a large coin on a disposable radio-frequency tag will shield it. Non-disposable tags require stronger magnets or pieces of metal to disable or shield since the strips are inside the casing and thus further away. Deactivation of some EAS tags can trigger signals sent to the cashier alerting them.\n\nMost systems can be circumvented by placing the tagged goods in a bag lined with aluminum foil. The booster bag will act as a Faraday cage, shielding the tags from the antennas. Although some vendors claim that their acousto-magnetic systems cannot be defeated by bags shielded with aluminum foil, a sufficient amount of shielding (in the order of 30 layers of standard 20 μm foil) will defeat all standard systems.\n\nAlthough the amount of shielding required depends on the system, its sensitivity, and the distance and orientation of the tags relative to its antennas, total enclosure of tags is not strictly necessary. Indeed, some shoplifters use clothes lined with aluminum foil. Low-frequency magnetic systems will require more shielding than radio-frequency systems due to their use of near-field magnetic coupling. Magnetic shielding, with steel or mu-metal, would be more effective, but also cumbersome and expensive.\n\nThe shielding technique is well known amongst shoplifters and store owners. Some countries have specific laws against it. In any case, possession of such a bag demonstrates a prior-intent to commit a crime, which in many jurisdictions raises shoplifting from misdemeanor to felony status, because they are considered a \"burglary tool.\" \n\nTo deter the use of booster bags, some stores have add-on metal detector systems which sense metallic surfaces.\n\nLike most systems that rely on transmission of electromagnetic signals through a hostile medium, EAS sensors can be rendered inoperative by jamming. As the signals from tags are very low-power (their cross-section is small, and the exits are wide), jamming requires little power. Evidently, shoplifters will not feel the need to follow radio transmission regulations; hence crude, easy-to-build transmitters will be adequate for them. However, due to their high frequency of operation, building a jammer can be difficult for microwave circuits; these systems are therefore less likely to be jammed. Although jamming is easy to perform, it is also easy to detect. A simple firmware upgrade should be adequate for modern DSP-based EAS systems to detect jamming. Nevertheless, the vast majority of EAS systems do not currently detect it.\n\nAll electronic article surveillance systems emit electromagnetic energy and thus can interfere with electronics.\n\nMagneto-harmonic systems need to bring the tags to magnetic saturation and thus create magnetic fields strong enough to be felt through a small magnet. They routinely interfere with CRT displays. Demagnetization-remagnetization units also create intense fields.\n\nAcousto-magnetic systems use less power but their signals are pulsed in the 100 Hz range.\n\nRadio-frequency systems tend to be the least interfering because of their lower power and operating frequency in the MHz range, which makes them easy to shield against.\n\nA March 2007 study by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota reported instances where acousto-magnetic EAS systems located at the front of retail stores caused a pacemaker to fail and a defibrillator to trigger, shocking the persons they were implanted in.\n\nThere are also concerns that some installations are intentionally reconfigured to exceed the rated specifications of the manufacturer, thereby exceeding tested and certified magnetic field levels. \n\nRadio-frequency systems have the most manufacturers because they are not covered by patents, use well-known technology derived from radio communications, use little power, and can be manufactured without expensive metal alloys. There are exceptions however for example; a patented die-cut circuit manufacturing process is held by Miyake Inc. of Japan. Also, patents have recently been appearing for various combination tag designs for integration of both RF and RFID. The last known patent is the \"Global Guard\" by Argos Global, an EAS system that integrates video surveillance hidden inside pedestals, getting a close up of potential thieves.\n\nWhat was regarded as physically unsolvable, succeeded in 2003 by Tagit who had its three-dimensional EM system-registered as a patent in the United States.\n\nRetailers Advantage has become more prominent with their release of both the 'a3tag' and 'STPLUS' hard tags. They remain one the last developers who own patents on EAS and RFID hard tags.\n\nUntil recently, acousto-magnetic systems were covered by now-expired patents held by Sensormatic. WG Security Products, Inc. won a court battle against Sensormatic clarifying that WG Security Products acousto-magnetic systems did not infringe any Sensormatic patents.\nDisposable acousto-magnetic tags require special metal alloys; non-disposable ones require more expensive ferrite cores.\n\nA 2017 review study found that \"based on the available evidence it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of tags as a theft reduction measure, albeit there is suggestive evidence that more visible tags are associated with greater reductions in theft than less visible tags\".\n\n\n"}

Montgomery began singing with his brother Eddie, who would later become known as one half of the duo Montgomery Gentry, before beginning his major-label solo career in 1992. He has had more than 30 singles on the \"Billboard\" country charts, of which seven have reached number one: \"I Love the Way You Love Me\", \"I Swear\", \"Be My Baby Tonight\", \"If You've Got Love\", \"I Can Love You Like That\", \"Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)\", and \"The Little Girl\". 13 more have reached the top 10. \"I Swear\" and \"Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)\" were named by \"Billboard\" as the top country songs of 1994 and 1995, respectively. Montgomery's recordings of \"I Swear\" and \"I Can Love You Like That\" were both released concurrently with cover versions by the R&B group All-4-One. Several of Montgomery's singles crossed over to the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, his highest peak there having been achieved by \"Letters from Home\" in 2004.\n\nMontgomery has released 10 studio albums. His first seven albums were released via Atlantic Records Nashville, and his next two via parent company Warner Bros. Records Nashville after Atlantic closed its country division in 2001. His first three albums, \"Life's a Dance\" (1992), \"Kickin' It Up\" (1994), and \"John Michael Montgomery\" (1995) are all certified multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); 1996's \"What I Do the Best\" is certified platinum; while \"Leave a Mark\" (1998) and \"Brand New Me\" (2000) are certified gold.\n\nJohn Michael Montgomery was born in Danville, Kentucky, United States, on January 20, 1965, to parents Carol Dean (née Lay) and Harold Edward Montgomery (1941-1994). He was raised in Nicholasville, Kentucky. Montgomery received musical encouragement from his father, who played in a local country band and taught him his first chords. John Michael joined the family band (which included his older brother, Eddie Montgomery, who with Troy Gentry would form the duo Montgomery Gentry), playing guitar before becoming lead singer when his parents divorced. Later, he performed as a solo artist playing \"working man's country.\" Atlantic Records spotted him and signed him.\n\nIn 1992, Montgomery's debut album, \"Life's a Dance\", produced his chart debut in its title track, which peaked at number 4 on the Hot Country Songs charts. It was followed by his first number 1 hit, \"I Love the Way You Love Me\", which also crossed over to the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with a peak of number 60. The album's last single was \"Beer and Bones\", with a number 21 country peak. \"I Love the Way You Love Me\" was named Single of the Year by the Academy of Country Music, and \"Life's a Dance\" earned triple-platinum Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certification for shipments of three million copies. He appeared on the PBS music program \"Austin City Limits\" in 1994 during Season 19.\n\nMontgomery's second album was 1994's \"Kickin' It Up\". This album was led off by the No. 1 country and No. 42 pop hit \"I Swear\", which was also the top country song of 1994 according to Billboard Year-End. After this song came the No. 4 \"Rope the Moon\", and two more No. 1 singles in \"Be My Baby Tonight\" and \"If You've Got Love\". \"I Swear\" gained further success a year later, when it was covered by pop group All-4-One. \"Kickin' It Up\" also sold even higher than his debut, earning a quadruple platinum certification for shipments of four million copies.\n\nIn 1995, he released his self-titled third studio album. Also a quadruple-platinum seller, it accounted for five hit singles, including the Number One hits \"I Can Love You Like That\" and \"Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)\". Like \"I Swear\" before it, the former was covered by All-4-One, while the latter was also declared the Number One country hit of 1995 on the Billboard Year-End charts. After this pair of Number One hits came the No. 3 \"No Man's Land\", then two consecutive No. 4 singles in \"Cowboy Love\" and \"Long as I Live.\" Also included on the album was \"Holdin' Onto Somethin'\", which was a top 10 country hit in early 1996 for Jeff Carson. At the end of 1995, Montgomery placed his career on hiatus due to a vocal cord injury.\n\n\"What I Do the Best\" was his fourth studio album, released by Atlantic in 1996. This was the first album of his career not to produce a No. 1 country hit. It also failed to match the sales of its predecessors, although it still earned platinum certification. This album was led off by the No. 15 \"Ain't Got Nothin' On Us\", which despite debuting in the Top 40 its first week on the charts, also became his first single since 1993's \"Beer and Bones\" to miss Top Ten. He regained his chart momentum with three more Top Ten hits off the same album: \"Friends\" at No. 2, \"I Miss You a Little\" at No. 6 and \"How Was I to Know\" also at No. 2. After this album, he released a \"Greatest Hits\" album in 1997, which reprised his greatest hits to that point and went platinum in the United States. It also included the new song \"Angel in My Eyes\", which was a No. 4 single for him that year. Also in 1997, Montgomery sang guest vocals on \"Warning Signs\", a No. 56-peaking musical track which included snippets from a Bill Engvall comedy sketch.\n\nIn 1998, Montgomery released his fifth album, \"Leave a Mark\". This album contained a more pop-oriented sound than his previous work. Despite only earning a gold certification from the RIAA, it accounted for three more hit singles. First was \"Love Working on You\" at No. 14, followed by \"Cover You in Kisses\" at No. 3 and \"Hold On to Me\" at No. 4. Despite having several of his singles cross over to the pop charts, \"Hold On to Me\" was his first Top 40 pop hit, reaching No. 33 on the Hot 100.\n\n\"Home to You\", his sixth album, continued to move Montgomery toward a mature audience, and continued his declining album sales. It produced a No. 15 in \"Hello L.O.V.E.\" and a No. 2 in its title track, although the next two singles — \"Nothing Catches Jesus by Surprise\" and \"You Are\" — both fell short of Top 40, with the former being his first single to do so.\n\nMontgomery returned to the top of the country charts for the first time since 1995 with \"The Little Girl\". This song, featuring backing vocals from Alison Krauss and inspired by an urban legend, was the first single from his 2000 album \"Brand New Me\", spending three weeks at Number One and reaching No. 35 on the Hot 100. Despite the success of this song, however, Montgomery again found his chart success declining after \"The Little Girl\", as the album's other two singles — \"That's What I Like About You\" and \"Even Then\" — both failed to reach Top 40, although \"Brand New Me\" earned a gold certification. By the end of the year, Montgomery was also moved from Atlantic to parent label Warner Bros. Records after Atlantic closed its Nashville branch.\n\nHis first release for Warner Bros. was 2002's \"Pictures\". This album saw minimal success in its chart singles, with lead-off \"Til Nothing Comes Between Us\" reaching No. 19 and the next two singles (\"Country Thang\" and \"Four Wheel Drive\") once again missing Top 40. The album was followed a year later by \"Mr. Snowman\", a Christmas album, in 2003, as well as a compilation entitled \"The Very Best of John Michael Montgomery\"\n\nMontgomery's last Warner Bros. release was 2004's \"Letters from Home\". Although the lead-off single, \"Cool\" failed to chart, the first single of Montgomery's career not to chart, the title track became his biggest crossover hit with a No. 2 country and No. 24 pop peak. Despite the success of this single, the album's third and final release, \"Goes Good with Beer\", peaked at No. 51, and after its release, Montgomery exited his label.\n\nAfter an off-key performance of the National Anthem at the televised NASCAR event, Golden Corral 500, on March 20, 2005, Montgomery confirmed on his website that he had a condition known as acoustic neuroma, which is a non-cancerous growth that interferes with a nerve running between the brain and the ear. This condition can affect balance and hearing. The problem was corrected, and did not alter Montgomery's touring schedule for the rest of 2005.\n\nAt 2:20 a.m. on February 16, 2006, Montgomery was arrested at an intersection in Lexington, Kentucky for driving under the influence and possession of a controlled substance, which was identified as Endocet by the \"Lexington Herald-Leader\". Police also found two loaded handguns in Montgomery's vehicle. Montgomery was charged with a count of a prescription drug not in its proper container, two counts of carrying a concealed deadly weapon, disregarding a traffic control device and performing an improper turn.\n\nMontgomery's lawyer, Jon Woodall, has stated that Montgomery is a hunter, and holds a concealed weapon permit, though Montgomery did not have the license with him at the time of arrest. Woodall also stated that the prescription was filled by Montgomery's physicians after Montgomery's recent hip replacement surgery. He has since been found not guilty of all charges. Montgomery pleaded no-contest to the charge of DUI, stating that he did not admit guilt, but the state had enough evidence to convict him.\n\nOn May 9, 2008, Montgomery announced that he was in rehab for an undisclosed substance abuse problem; he sought rehab at a drug-treatment facility in Hazard, KY. His condition was cited as severe anxiety attacks and a sleep disorder.\n\nIn late 2008, Montgomery founded his own label, Stringtown Records. That year, he released his next album, \"Time Flies\". This album produced three singles: \"Mad Cowboy Disease\", \"If You Ever Went Away\", and \"Forever.\" Although the first two both failed to chart, \"Forever\" peaked at No. 28 on the country charts, representing his first chart entry in over four years. Mad Cowboy Disease reached No. 17 on Mediabase's Satellite Radio chart. He also sang duet vocals on the title track to Colt Ford's debut album \"Ride Through the Country\".\n\nMontgomery married Crystal White on January 8, 1996. Together, they have two children, daughter Madison (born in August 1996) and son Walker (born in February 1999).\n\nMontgomery’s son Walker has followed his father’s footsteps, releasing his hit single “Simple Town” in 2017 and the “Simple Town” EP the following year.\n\nMontgomery's nephew, Dillon Carmichael, is also a singer.\n\n\n"}

Each patriarch of the east has authority over all bishops of a particular eastern rite church. These patriarchs are elected by their synods, and must extend communion to and receive it from the other patriarchs, including the pope, before officially taking their office. In matters of discipline and practice, but not in matters of dogma, they generally follow the customs and laws of their particular church. Perhaps the most striking example is that in most Eastern Catholic Churches, ordination of married men to the priesthood is routine (although no priest may marry \"after\" ordination, and only celibate priests may become bishops). Eastern churches that are not headed by patriarchs are instead headed by bishops who are titled major archbishops, metropolitans, or in a few cases merely eparchs.\n\nAround the time of the Second Vatican Council, as a result of new ecumenical bonds between the Eastern Rite Catholic and Latin Rite Catholic churches and their leaders, some Eastern patriarchs that headed Eastern churches recognizing the papacy (and thus making the joint reception of Communion possible) were elevated to Cardinal. \n\nThe patriarchs of the Eastern Rite Catholic churches are:\n\nThe Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem is also considered one of the patriarchs of the east.

Units 1 and 2 are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to operate through 2033 and 2034, respectively. The plant is owned by Northern States Power Company (NSP), a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, and is operated by Xcel Energy.\n\nPrairie Island is one of two nuclear power plants in Minnesota (the other being Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant in Monticello). Prairie Island has attracted controversy in the early 21st century for its operator Xcel Energy's decision to store nuclear waste in large steel casks on-site. As this area is a floodplain of the Mississippi, many opponents of the decision fear the risk of water contamination through breach of the casks during seasonal flooding of this important river. They opposed renewal of the federal license at the Prairie Island facility.\n\nIn April 2008, Xcel requested that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) renew the licenses of both reactors, extending them for an additional twenty years. The license renewals were approved in June 2011.\n\nThe company has also requested NRC approval to use a similar storage system at its Monticello plant, which is currently licensed through 2030.\n\nIn May 2006 repair workers at the plant were exposed to very low levels of radiation due to inhalation of radioactive iodine-131 (I) gas. The gas leaked from the steam generators, which were opened for inspection. I gas is normally removed by means of a carbon-based filter; in this case the filter had developed a small leak. The NRC deemed this event to be of very low safety significance. It said that no overdose of radiation resulted in any of the workers.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone has a radius of , and is related primarily to exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination. Secondly, an ingestion pathway zone with a radius of about , is concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid by residents that could be contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Prairie Island was 27,996, an increase of 4.6 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for MSNBC. The 2010 U.S. population within was 2,945,237, an increase of 7.8 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Minneapolis (39 miles to city center) and St. Paul (32 miles to city center).\n\nNSP had initially intended to send radioactive waste from this plant to a storage facility operated by the United States federal government, but no such site is yet open for use. (The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is under construction, but given strong opposition in the region, the Obama Administration no longer thought this was an option.)\n\nIn 1991, Xcel Energy had requested permission from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to eventually store waste in 48 dry casks on the Prairie Island site. Opposition by environmentalists and the neighboring Prairie Island tribe led the Minnesota Legislature to decrease the number of allowed casks to 17; this was sufficient to keep the plant operating through approximately 2003.\n\nWhen those casks filled, Xcel Energy requested that the limit be expanded beyond 17 casks. The legislature granted the request, but required the company to make greater use of renewable energy in generating power, such as wind power. In addition, it was required to pay the adjacent Prairie Island Community up to $2.25 million per year to help with evacuation improvements, and the acquisition and development of new land for their reservation. In addition, this money was to help pay for a health study and emergency management activities by the small tribe.\n\nOperators at Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant began a refueling outage on Unit 2 at 12:01 a.m. 9/23/2013. In addition to refueling the reactor, an expanded workforce replaced the unit's two steam generators. Unit 2 was expected to come back online within eight weeks; however, it did not resume operation until January 13, 2014. At 2 AM on January 14th, Unit 2 reached 100% power output.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Prairie Island was 1 in 333,333, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\nXcel Energy performed an emergency shutdown in late January 2015 of the Unit 1 reactor after a cloud of steam built up in the pressurized cooling system following a cooling-down process to replace a seal in one of the reactor cooling pumps. The plant returned to full power in February 2015.\n\nUnit 2 of the plant has been shutdown due to an emergency on 5 March 2015, indicated by a fire alarm at 4:00 am CST. Xcel energy plant operators declared a “notification of an unusual event,” the lowest of four emergency classifications established by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nUnit 2 shut down automatically Dec 17, 2015 due to a turbine problem, and the fire alarm went off at the time.

In 1846 he was appointed Medical Superintendent of The Retreat, the Quaker psychiatric hospital near York. In 1848 he reported two maternal first cousins with an unusual condition affecting the skin, hair and teeth (an ectodermal dysplasia); he had performed an examination post mortem on one of the two men, including relevant histopathology.\n\nThurnam was born at Lingcroft, near Copmanthorpe, York to the Quaker William Thurnam and his wife Sarah Clark.\n\nAfter a private education he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1834, a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1843, and a fellow in 1859. He graduated M.D. at the University of Aberdeen in 1846.\n\nHaving served as resident medical officer in the Westminster Hospital from 1834 till 1838, Thurnam was appointed medical superintendent of the Friends' retreat in York. That post he held until 1849. The Wiltshire county asylum at Devizes was then being built, and the committee selected Thurnam to be medical superintendent. It was opened in 1851, and he remained in active charge until his death.\n\nThurnam's leisure was devoted to statistical facts on mental illness and investigations of anthropological and antiquarian interest. He was twice elected president of the Medico-Psychological Association.\n\nThurnam died at Devizes . On 18 June 1851 he had married Frances Elizabeth, daughter of Matthew Wyatt, a metropolitan police magistrate, and sister of Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt. By her he left three sons.\n\nWhile at the Westminster Hospital he had gained some reputation from his observations on aneurysm of the heart. In 1843 he published ‘Observations and Essays on the Statistics of Insanity, and on Establishments for the Insane.’ This work contained a reprint of the ‘Statistics of the York Retreat,’ first issued in 1841, together with a historical and descriptive sketch.\n\nAfter his move to Wiltshire he gave special consideration to craniology. Thurnam with Dr. Joseph Barnard Davis published a work in two volumes under the title of \"Crania Britannica\" in 1865, important for craniometry. Thurnam and Davis were both believers in polygenism, in the form that different races had been created separately. Davis was a collector of craniums, and had over 1700 specimens. Because of the racial differences of the craniums, Davis and Thurnam believed that proofs of polygenism were to be found in studying the skull types of different races. From different sizes and types of skull they deduced separate origins.\n\nTwo shorter papers were ‘Synostoses of the Cranial Bones regarded as a Race Character’ (Nat. Hist. Rev. 1865), and ‘Weight of the Human Brain’ (Journ. of Ment. Science, 1868). Thurnam recognised the importance of the obliteration of the sutures of the skull, which he had observed in the dolichocephalous crania of the Stone Age, but not in the brachycephalous crania of the bronze period. His conclusion was that this is a strictly race character.\n\n"}

Warwick is the oldest of five high schools in the city and has been home to the Newport News Centre for the International Baccalaureate (IB) program since 1996. The school's sports teams are known as the Raiders.\n\nThe school originally opened in 1926 as Morrison High School in the small community of Morrison. It became Warwick High School in 1948. Originally located in Warwick County, it became part of the Newport News Public Schools system in 1958 when the citizenry of the former Warwick County voted to be politically consolidated with the neighboring independent city of Newport News, adopting the name of the latter for the newly enlarged independent city, which became the largest in Virginia geographically at the time. The facilities at Warwick High School were expanded to their present size in 1968.\n\nFollowing the 1954 \"Brown vs. Board of Education\" decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, racial desegregation lawsuits eventually resulted in a federal court-ordered busing program in Newport News which began in 1971. Busing changed the nature of Warwick's population and community. However, in the years after the federal court supervision ended, a magnet school approach was adopted to successfully attract students and families to voluntarily select the school.\n\nDue to overcrowding, Warwick High School expanded into the building which was formerly the Warwick Early Childhood Center. This building is now known as the Senior Center, although students from all grades may have classes there.\nDuring the 2007-2008 school year, Warwick High School started an archery team. This team has won the state competition and gone to nationals in Louisville, Kentucky multiple times. At nationals, the team has been nominated for the spirit award.\n\nWarwick High School's Scholastic Bowl team placed fourth in the state and second in the Eastern Region during the 2012-13 season, winning both the regular season and post-season tournament in the Peninsula District. The team won regular-season district competition in three of the last five years (2008–09, 2010–11, and 2012–13) and has won the post-season District Tournament every year since 2008-09. The Raider Scholastic Bowl team is currently undefeated in Conference Ten, its new VHSL competitive group.\n\nWarwick High School has also enjoyed great success in debate and forensics. Students from the debate team have qualified for the state championship tournament every year from 2003-04 to the present (2018-19). Students from the forensics team have qualified for the state championship tournament every year from 2002-03 to the present (2019-20).\n\nThe school formerly had a bowling team which won the VHSTBL championship in 2006 and 2009.

{"id": "1802561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802561", "title": "George Edmund Street", "text": "George Edmund Street\n\nGeorge Edmund Street (20 June 1824 – 18 December 1881), also known as G. E. Street, was an English architect, born at Woodford in Essex. Stylistically, Street was a leading practitioner of the Victorian Gothic revival. Though mainly an ecclesiastical architect, he is perhaps best known as the designer of the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in London.\n\nStreet was the third son of Thomas Street, a solicitor, by his second wife, Mary Anne Millington. He went to school at Mitcham in about 1830, and later to the Camberwell Collegiate School, which he left in 1839. For a few months he worked in his father's business in Philpot Lane, but on his father's death he went to live with his mother and sister at Exeter. There his thoughts first turned to architecture, and in 1841 his mother obtained a place for him as pupil in the office of Owen Browne Carter at Winchester. Afterwards he worked for five years as an \"improver\" with George Gilbert Scott in London.\n\nHis first commission – undertaken while still working for Scott – was for the design of Biscovey Church, Cornwall. In 1849 he set up in practice in an office of his own. Much of his earliest work, which included many church restorations, was in Cornwall.\n\nIn November 1850, having been appointed architect to the diocese of Oxford by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, he left London, and moved to Wantage, where he had already designed a vicarage, and was working on some schools. In May 1852 he went to live in Beaumont Street, Oxford. He designed the parish church of SS Philip and James in the city, and another at Summertown, as well as restoring many others. Street built or restored 113 churches in the diocese of Oxford. However, his only work for the university was the reordering of Jesus College Chapel. His son Arthur Edmund Street suggested that: Possibly my father's very decided adherence to the earlier phase of Gothic, and the eagerness with which he argued that Oxford had already enough of debased types, and should revert to the purity of the early forms, may have frightened the authorities.During this period he developed his use of constructional polychromy, in churches such as All Saints, Boyne Hill. Maidenhead .\n\nEarly in his career, he advocated the idea that architects should have a practical involvement with the decoration of their buildings, and painted murals at Boyne Hill church himself. However, with his increasing amount of business, he soon realised the difficulties of such an approach.\n\nHe remained in Oxford until late in 1855, when he moved back to London, taking a house in Montagu Place, Bloomsbury. At around this time he entered the competition to design the new cathedral at Lille, winning second prize, behind a design by Henry Clutton and William Burges. He came second to Burges in another competition, to design the Crimea Memorial Church in Constantinople, but eventually received the commission. He also submitted, unsuccessfully, Gothic schemes for the new Foreign Office in Whitehall, and for a projected rebuilding of the National Gallery.\n\nStreet was an active member of the Ecclesiological Society. From an early age he had been interested in the principles of Gothic architecture, and made frequent tours to study and draw Gothic architecture across Europe. He was an exceptional draughtsman, and in 1855 he published a very careful and well illustrated work on \"The Brick and Marble Architecture of Northern Italy\", and in 1865 a book on \"The Gothic Architecture of Spain\". These works inspired the wider use of constructional polychromy by British architects, sometimes mocked as \"The Streaky Bacon Style\".\n\nAt St James the Less, in Thorndike Street, Westminster (1858–61), Street used red brick, with black brick decoration both inside and out, and gave the church a tall, square campanile-like tower, its roof based on a Genoese model. Charles Locke Eastlake, writing in 1872, saw this as a prime example of the \"revolt from [English] national style\" that was occurring amongst Gothic Revival architects at this time, at least in part inspired by John Ruskin's enthusiasm for the medieval architecture of Northern Italy, and by the publication of Viollet-le-Duc's exhaustive \"Dictionnaire raisonné de l'Architecture Française du XIe au XVIe Siècle\": Here the whole character of the building, whether we regard its plan, its distinctive features, its external or internal decoration is eminently un-English. Even the materials used in its construction and the mode by which it is lighted were novelties. The detached tower with its picturesquely modelled spire, its belfry stage rich in ornamental brick-work and marble bosses, the semicircular apse and quasi-transepts, the plate tracery, the dormers inserted in the clerestory, the quaint treatment of the nave arcade, the bold vigour of the carving, the chromatic decoration of the roof—all bear evidence of a thirst for change which Mr. Street could satisfy without danger, but which betrayed many of his contemporaries into intemperance.\n\nTwo features Street was particularly fond of using were the round apse and the louvred belfry windows.\n\nStreet was commissioned by Alexander Lindsay, 25th Earl of Crawford in 1867 to design several aspects of the extension work undertaken at Dunecht House, Aberdeenshire. These included the Library and a Chapel.\n\nIn 1868 Street was made Diocesan Architect of Ripon, in addition to the similar posts which he already held in the dioceses of York and Oxford, and to which Winchester was subsequently added. He was also appointed Architect to York Minster at around this time, and, later on, to Salisbury and Carlisle Cathedrals.\n\nStreet's most recognisable building is probably the Law Courts (now the Royal Courts of Justice) in the Strand in London. The competition for this was prolonged, and much diversity of opinion was expressed. The judges wanted Street to make the exterior arrangements and Charles Barry the interior, while a special committee of lawyers recommended the designs of Alfred Waterhouse. In June 1868, however, Street was appointed sole architect; but the building was not complete at the time of his death in December 1881.Apart from the Law Courts, by far the majority of Street's output was for ecclesiastical uses, the largest being the nave of Bristol Cathedral and the restoration of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. Chief amongst his complete works include St Margaret's convent, East Grinstead, and the theological college at Cuddesdon. Other churches of which he was the architect include All Saints' (Church of England), St Paul's Within The Walls (American Episcopal) in Rome, and, also for the American Episcopal Church, the American Cathedral in Paris, completed posthumously by Arthur E Street in 1886. His work was not exclusively in the Gothic revival manner, as is demonstrated by Ralli's dramatic Lycian-Byzantine temple at Norwood Cemetery, the Romanesque reworking of the nearby church of St Luke and the rebuilding of All Saints' at Roydon, in West Norfolk, in a style to match its two Norman doorways. Street also designed the family chapel at Gwrych Castle in Abergele. Denbighshire.\n\nStreet carried out a number of new works in Ireland, including the small clifftop church of St. John the Evangelist at Ardamine, Co. Wexford, and Piltown Church, Co. Kilkenny. His most significant work was the controversial re-edification of the historic Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, in the course of which he was responsible for demolishing the choir which he considered to be of \"no historic significance\". Street designed the adjacent Synod Hall around the existing 12th century St Michael's Church. He also restored St. Brigid's Cathedral, Kildare Town, Ireland, which was a roofless ruin when he started work. The Cathedral reopened in 1896. He succeeded in rebuilding the lost walls to match the remnants which remained of the original walls and square tower.\n\nStreet was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1866, and a fellow in 1871; at the time of his death he was professor of architecture to the Royal Academy, where he had delivered a course of lectures on the development of medieval architecture. He was also president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He was a member of the Royal Academy of Vienna, and in 1878, in reward for drawings sent to the Paris Exhibition, he was made a knight of the Legion of Honour.\n\nIn 1856–7, Philip Webb was Street's senior clerk and the young William Morris one of his apprentices. These two designers worked together on the Red House that became a memorial to William Morris's design principles and includes work by many of his now-famous friends. Another apprentice in the early 1870s was the Canadian architect Frank Darling.\n\nStreet was twice married, first on 17 June 1852 to Marquita Proctor, second daughter of Robert Proctor, who died in 1874 aged 44. They met when Street was employed to restore the church at Hadleigh, in Essex, where the rector was Marquita's uncle. His second wife was Jessie Holland, second daughter of William Holland. They married on 11 January 1876, but she died in the same year.\n\nStreet's death, on 18 December 1881, was hastened by overwork and professional worries connected with the building of the law courts. He was buried on 29 December 1881 in the nave of Westminster Abbey.\n\nStreet was an adherent of the high church tradition of the Church of England. For many years he was a churchwarden of All Saints, Margaret Street in London, built in the 1850s as a \"model church\" under the supervision of the Ecclesiological Society. He was particularly insistent that all seats in churches should be free of charge, rather than subject to pew rent.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1802581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802581", "title": "Generation X (band)", "text": "Generation X (band)\n\nGeneration X (later known as Gen X) were an English punk rock band from London in the late 1970s, primarily remembered today for being the musical starting point of the career of its frontman/vocalist, Billy Idol.\n\nDuring the punk rock movement in London in late 1976, William Broad, a 21 year old guitar-playing university drop-out from Bromley and associate of the Bromley Contingent; the drummer John Towe, a West End music shop assistant, and - at Broad's suggestion, having already met via an ad previously put in the \"Melody Maker\" by Broad seeking other musicians - Tony James, a 23 year old university graduate bass player from Twickenham and former member of the London S.S., all replied to an advert placed in the \"Melody Maker\" by John Krivine, the owner of a fashion clothing shop called \"Acme Attractions\" in the King's Road in Chelsea, seeking musicians to form a new West London band around the vocalist/frontman John O'Hara aka Gene October. After a few weeks of rehearsals the band became known as \"Chelsea\", and began by playing a few support gigs in West London and Manchester, primarily playing cover versions of rock and roll songs from the 1960s. However, by November, Gene October felt that Broad and James were becoming too dominant creatively and were beginning to make music that he considered too lightweight, and that his personal chemistry with them wasn't good - a feeling which they reciprocated. Consequently, Broad and James along with Towe abandoned \"Chelsea\" (jettisoning October on stage from the line-up in the midst of a gig), and formed a new band named \"Generation X\" after a book with that title that James found that belonged to Broad's mother when visiting his family home. The new band was initially managed by Andrew Czezowski, \"Acme Attractions\"' accountant.\n\nWith his photogenic looks and inherent egotism Broad, styling himself with a punk pseudonym of \"Billy Idol\", abandoned the guitar to be the frontman and lead singer of the new unit. When the 17 year old lead guitarist Bob \"Derwood\" Andrews was recruited from the Fulham rocker band \"Paradox\", 'Generation X' took the stage for the first time in public at the Central School of Art and Design on 10 December 1976. The new band played its second gig 4 days later at the newly opened The Roxy, which their manager Czezowski had also taken over the management of, being the first to play at the venue. Soon after formation Generation X abandoned playing cover versions in its live performances around London of other acts' songs and began writing its own material, with Idol writing music around James' lyrical song constructions.\n\nIn early 1977 the management for the band was passed from Czezowoski, who preferred club management to live acts, to a dual management of Stewart Joseph, a fanzine promoter from Rough Trade Records, with the \"Sounds\" journalist Jonh Ingham, who professionalized the act's business aspect, and began approaching record companies to secure a recording deal for it.\n\nOn 16 February 1977 the band went into a studio for the first time to record a demo session of five songs at De Lane Lea Studios in Wembley, North London, sponsored by Chiswick Records. The lyrics of some of the songs possessed a partially politicized tone (with a critique of The National Front, and The Troubles) that the band would abandon after its early months. Later in the year Generation X's first record was released by the band itself in the form of an unmarked white label for promotional purposes, with the song \"Your Generation\" as its A-side, and \"Listen\" as the B-side, taken from the De Lane Lea demo session. 250 copies were initially pressed, followed by another 500 copies, all in unmarked white paper sleeves.\n\nIn mid-March 1977, amidst a heavy performance schedule in London and increasingly beyond the confines of the capital city into England's provinces, a gig had to be abandoned at the University of Leicester mid-performance due to Derwood Andrews requiring hospitalization from being struck on the head by a beer bottle thrown from the crowd. In mid-April 1977, having just played their first international date in Paris in a joint billing alongside the upcoming bands The Jam and The Police, and recorded Generation X's first live radio session at the British Broadcasting Corporation's Maida Vale Studios, John Towe was asked to leave the band by James and Idol as they felt that his style of playing was too overt for what they wanted from a drummer, and James, the band's strategist, had come to the view that Towe's personality didn't fit with the image that he was formulating the act into. Towe moved on to join a new outfit called \"Alternative TV\". He was replaced on drums by the 18 year old Mark Laff from North Finchley, recruited from Subway Sect after an extensive audition process for the vacancy organized by Idol and James in May 1977. From June to August 1977 in between gigs the band practiced in a rehearsal space in the basement beneath a Beggars Banquet record shop in the Fulham Road.\n\nIn mid-July Generation X signed a recording contract with Chrysalis Records, and went into Wessex Sound Studios in North London for the band's first formal recording session for commercial release. Under the supervision of the producer Bill Price the session proved to be abortive due to the band being unhappy with the results, and Chrysalis Records sought another producer, which it found in Phil Wainman. At the end of July 1977 the band worked with Wainman at Morgan Studios in Willesden, recording its first single \"Your Generation\". Wainman wasn't impressed with the musical ability of the band, particularly with Laff's technical proficiency, or with Idol's capacity as a singer, and in response to Idol asking for his opinion during production as to whether he thought Generation X were \"going to make it\", answered with some dubiety. On release at the start of September 1977 \"Your Generation\", with a b-side of the high-energy disaffected punk-rock song \"Day by Day\" (with a title taken by James from the recent publication of Robin Day's autobiography), went to #36 in the U.K. Singles Chart, after being critiqued by Elton John in a review column in the \"Record Mirror\" as 'dreadful garbage'. The band played the song on Marc Bolan's afternoon variety show, \"Marc\", a few days later using Granada Television's Manchester studio instruments for the performance, afterwards making off with the drum-kit and being banned by Granada for 10 years as a result.\n\nAlong with writing and performing the band's musical output, James and Idol around this period sought to extend the band's brand identity beyond purely the musical sphere by designing and manufacturing a series of op-art and pop-art T-shirts for use in Generation X's photo-shoots and live performances, and James was attentive to its public image conveyed in the act's dress and styling. The band's co-manager Jonh Ingham introduced them to the graphic artist Barney Bubbles, who with them created the cover for the \"Your Generation\" single release, drawing inspiration from the 1920s abstract geometric work of Russian designer El Lissitsky, which introduced the Russian Constructivist school into English pop music design, which would be utilized by other bands into the 21st Century. Bubbles was also commissioned by the band to design its newspaper adverts and posters.\n\nIn September 1977 Generation X was one of the first punk units to appear on the B.B.C.'s mainstream pop music programme \"Top of the Pops\", and began to acquire some mass media recognition as one of the punk-rock acts that had an accessibility of sound and image with the potential to achieve commercial pop music success. Contrarily the same analysis led to recurring adverse criticism of the band in the media of the alternative music scene from which it had emerged, with a number of reviewers dismissing the act as artistically and intellectually vapid, and suggesting that it was using the guise of being a part of the punk movement cynically as a stepping-stone in pursuance of more prosaic pop music fame and fortune. As punk-rock developed an increasingly radical overtone, driven partly by the politicized content of the songs of \"The Clash\", Generation X also faced accusations of being middle-class interlopers upon what was increasingly espoused as a working-class sub-culture movement, evidence for this being a story in circulation within the scene originating from the music journalist Tony Parsons of the \"New Musical Express\" that when Idol and James had turned up in \"The Ship\" pub in Wardour Street for an interview with him, on being asked what they wanted to drink, had requested orange juices, and had openly criticized and rejected on an intellectual basis the hedonism of the \"Sex, drugs and Rock 'n' Roll\" lifestyle. The interview had been conducted shortly after the band's formation, and James and Idol (particularly the latter) had since moved some way from this stance as they moved through the social circles of London's pop music scene, but the initial impression from it lingered in the British punk rock movement.<br> Generation X stood out in the burgeoning milieu of punk-music bands for its combination of the raw raucous energy of punk-rock with a more commercially melodic sound and visual image in the tradition of earlier British pop music styles of the 1960s, drawing influences from bands such as The Who, The Kinks, The Small Faces, and The Beatles. It also produced songs that lyrically focused on the concerns of being an adolescent in West London in the late 1970s and, apart from playing a few gigs in support of Rock Against Racism, eschewed the societal commentary, cultural nihilism and radical politics of the punk movement, for which it drew some criticism from its peers, including John Lydon, the frontman-lyricist of the preeminent \"Sex Pistols\".\n\nIn late September/early October 1977 the band spent several days recording demo sessions, overseen by Phil Wainman, at Utopia Studios in Primrose Hill, North London, in preparation for its first long-player release.\n\nIn mid-November 1977 the band released the single \"Wild Youth\", written on the spur of the moment during a publicity photo-shoot with the photographer Ray Stevenson in the streets of London's West End a few weeks earlier, the song being inspired by street graffiti. The single's cover-art comprised individual colourized rotoscoped band portraits, taken by the photographer Peter \"Kodick\" Gravelle. It was produced by Phil Wainman at Utopia Studios, with an experimental b-side track entitled \"Wild Dub\" attempting an early fusion, before the subsequent Two-tone movement, of the Ska music of the West and South London Afro-Caribbean immigrant communities with Generation X's punk-pop sound, following on from The Clash's foray into the same area a few months earlier with their cover of the song \"Police and Thieves\". On release \"Wild Youth\" was the only commercial single issued by Generation X that failed to enter the UK Singles Chart.\n\nTowards the end of 1977 Jonh Ingham resigned from Generation X's management as a preliminary to his going to live in the United States, and after having come into conflict with Tony James, leaving Stewart Joseph in sole charge.\n\nIn February 1978 the single \"Ready Steady Go\" (with a b-side track entitled \"No No No\") was released with cover art taken from the design of one of the band's self-produced T-shirts, but it failed to enter the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. The band kept a hectic touring schedule throughout Great Britain through 1978, which included the event of a Hells Angel in the crowd at a gig in Derby in mid-March climbing up on to the stage and punching Idol in the face hard enough to cause him to fly backwards \"like a ping-pong ball\", landing in the drum-kit - Idol getting back on to his feet, dusting himself down and resuming the band's performance as if nothing had happened. In the same month the band's first long-player was released, entitled \"Generation X\" (1978), produced by Martin Rushent and engineered by Alan Winstanley at T.W. Studios in Fulham, with a cover portrait shot photographed by Gered Mankowitz, which went to #29 in the U.K. Albums Chart.\n\nIn April the \"New Musical Express\" featured Generation X in a 2-page centre-spread interview with the band to facilitate the first LP's retail sales, with a front-page full feature photo of Idol and James on the foreshore of the River Thames beneath the Embankment, taken by Pennie Smith. The article's illustration, atypically for band photography, displayed Idol with James separately from Andrews with Laff, and gave rise to talk within the punk scene that this was indicative of an inherent divide of some nature within the act, with it possessing an inner core which Andrews and Laff weren't party to.\n\nThe band maintained a high work rate of live performances as the year developed, with Idol also going on a first promotional visit for the band to the United States in May 1978, followed by another international gig for the band in Paris in June, several live BBC radio performances, and being supported by a new West Sussex band named The Cure for several dates in November and December '78. In October Generation X went into Wessex Sound Studios in Islington, with Ian Hunter acting as Producer, to record their second album, entitled \"Valley of the Dolls\", which saw the band moving to a style of mainstream rock music with the incorporation of aspects of the early 1970s Glam Punk movement and Progressive Rock into its sound and look, along with the mid-1970s song-writing techniques of Bruce Springsteen.\n\nIn January 1979 the band with its manager Stewart Joseph was called into the offices of Chrysalis Records, where they were told that the label was unhappy that the money that it had invested into the act since mid-1977 was not being reflected in its chart success, and that if its next single, entitled \"King Rocker\", wasn't a hit its contract would be dropped. After the meeting Joseph announced a cut in the band's members' weekly wages as an inducement to harder work. On release in the same month \"King Rocker\" (1979), with a b-side cover of John Lennon's \"Gimme Some Truth\" taken from a BBC live radio performance in 1977, became the band's commercial career high point, going to #11 in the United Kingdom's Singles Chart, assisted by being issued in the format of a variety of differently coloured discs with distinctive band portrait cover art which required multiple purchases of the single to acquire the complete set, designed by Barney Bubbles, who had worked on the band's graphic art previously in 1977.\nHowever, after a couple of propitious opening years, the band's third year saw a deterioration in its chart success from the high of the \"King Rocker\" single, with the \"Valley of the Dolls\" (1979) L.P., also released in January, performing disappointingly in the UK Albums Chart, reaching only #51. The new LP also received a critical mauling in the music press, with reviewers slating it as overblown and artistically hollow, which had the effect of undermining Idol's confidence in Tony James' judgement given that the record had been personally dominated by James' ideas throughout its production. The situation wasn't improved by Generation X being driven off stage by an onslaught of missiles from a mob of U.K. Subs fans during a triple-bill concert at the Lyceum Ballroom in London in February 1979, as a part of an ongoing violent tendency from a proto-Street punk element that dogged the band's live appearances. As the year progressed amidst a continuing heavy touring and increasing television performance schedule, induced by the commercial failure of the \"Valley of the Dolls\" L.P. and a lessening impact on the UK Singles Charts of its releases, with the title song from the L.P. peaking at #23 in March 1979 and the song \"Friday's Angels\" dying at #62 in June, consequential differences began to surface within the band in terms of personality antagonisms centered upon Andrews and Idol. Andrews was in antipathy with Idol's changing character caused by Idol's increasingly severe narcotic use, and his sensing of a soloist career intent within Idol (who was beginning to create a performance-persona based on elements from the solo acts of Gary Glitter, Elvis Presley and Billy Fury in their prime), which was in combination destabilizing the band's internal relationships. Rifts were also opening as to Generation X's future musical direction post the \"Valley of the Dolls\" L.P.'s sales failure. Andrews, who had been impressed by the recent work of the critically acclaimed Joy Division, favoured a move into the new Indie Rock sound, and wanted more of an involvement in the band's song composition, whilst Idol and James were drawn to a more mainstream and apparently commercial dance-punk one, were flirting with the idea of incorporating elements of shock rock into the band's act, and refused to admit his material into their song-writing partnership. These internal disagreements, complicated by the loss - in legal acrimony - of the band's manager Stewart Joseph, came to a head towards the end of 1979 after the band had returned from its first international tour in Japan. During uncompleted production sessions at Olympic Studios in Barnes for what was to have been Generation X's third album (released retrospectively 20 years later under the title \"K(iss) M(e) D(eadly) - Sweet Revenge\"), and a fragmentary brief tour of small venues ending in the West Country, Andrews quit the band just before Christmas. At Idol's instigation, Mark Laff was also asked to leave the band a few weeks later after a disagreement with Idol and James about its song-writing credits, with Laff objecting to the drumming tracks that he was creating not being recognized in its legal and financial arrangements regarding rights. Idol in return was of the view that Laff's playing style, heavily influenced by that of Keith Moon's, was unsuited to the new sound that Idol wished the act to pursue, and had developed doubts about Laff's professional capabilities since the recording of the \"Valley of the Dolls\" L.P., when Laff was judged to be technically inadequate by its producer Ian Hunter to the degree that a session drummer had to be hired by the band for the work in the studio. Laff departed to join Andrews in a new band entitled \"Empire\", which found little commercial success; Andrews would return to the British charts in the late 1980s with the pop rock/rockabilly band Westworld. Generation X's last live performance was at Gloucester's Jamaican Club on 30 November 1979.\n\nWith Andrews and Laff gone (with James putting out a line to the music press's questions as to why Generation X had split that he and Idol had fired them because they \"had a terrible tendency to sound like Deep Purple\"), Idol and James recruited Terry Chimes as a replacement drummer. James also found a manager for the new formation in the form of Bill Aucoin, however after assessing the act's potential, Aucoin was surreptitiously more interested in the commercial possibilities of Idol as a solo artist in the American marketplace than the band, and began moving behind the scenes to this end.\n\nThis new line-up re-titled itself as \"Gen X\", styling itself as a New Romantic band with a Neo-Victorian/Victorian Gothic look, influenced by Idol's interest in the writings of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\n\nIn March 1980 \"Gen X\" went into Eel Pie Studios in Soho with the lead guitarist Steve New to record a demo session of material, which included an extended experimental Noise Rock instrumental entitled \"Taxi Driver, Parts 1 & 2\", shadowing the sound of Public Image Limited's recently released Metal Box LP. Idol and James wanted New to be Gen X's guitarist, but after recording and rehearsing with him through the early months of 1980 they abandoned the idea over concerns about his professional reliability due to a narcotic habit.\n\nIn mid-1980 Gen X went into AIR Studios in Oxford Street to re-record some of the \"Sweet Revenge\" material and several new songs for a new long-player. Chrysalis Records, now subject to the influence of Aucoin, had shown reluctance to fund it after the commercial failure of the \"Valley of the Dolls\" L.P. in the previous year, and the debacle at the Olympic Studios a few months before, and to secure the new financing Idol had to recourse to entering into discussions with the label of the option of a potential solo career signed to it beyond the band's existence. Also involved in the recording sessions, along with Steve New, was a selection of some of the best lead guitarists in London's post-punk scene that were looking for new units to team up with, viz., John McGeoch, Steve Jones, and Danny Kustow, who acted as session musicians in what was essentially a tryout for the new band's guitar slot. In January 1981 a long-player produced by Keith Forsey was released entitled \"Kiss Me Deadly\" (1981).<br>However, the production of the new record had been problematic. Tony James later described narcotic use by other members of the line-up, including Idol, during the recording sessions as hampering it, and his personal working relationship with Idol was becoming distanced by James' unease at Idol's intensifying attraction to opiates (James would later ascribe the cause of the end of the band and his professional partnership with Idol to: \"really, drugs destroyed us\"). This distancing was exacerbated by Idol's increasing self-sufficiency in song-writing, a wearying of James's company due to what Idol perceived as an uptight and intense demeanor that had developed in James's personality, and an increasing allure to Idol of the prospects of a solo career for himself which had been waxing in his mind since the failure of the \"Valley of the Dolls\" LP in 1979. Also, during the recording of the \"Kiss Me Deadly\" L.P. James had got on badly with its producer Keith Forsey, with whom Idol had established a professional rapport and was eager to work with again.<br>The record itself, despite the innovation of its sound as a part of the New Wave movement in pop music, and its display of Idol and James' maturing talent as songwriters, failed to chart on release, regardless of a brief low-key tour in November 1980-January 1981 (with James Stevenson playing guitar) to promote it. A lacklustre pre-release in October 1980 of the song \"Dancing with Myself\", backed by a B-side of a Rocksteadyesque dub song entitled \"Ugly Rash\", with a stark cover art portrait of Idol photographed by Iain McKell utilizing a child model in a disturbing way, had also failed to launch the new act, reaching only #62 in the U.K. Singles Chart. A hotchpotch E.P., entitled \"Gen X - 4\", containing Generation X and Gen X material was also released in January to little effect. Critical reviews of the new L.P. in the music press were also generally indifferent, or hostile, with \"Smash Hits\" magazine giving it 2 out of 10. In consequence, after receiving notification from Aucoin that Idol was now willing to abandon the band, Chrysalis Records dropped the contract, writing off the quarter of a million pounds that it had invested into the act's development over four years, and Gen X broke up in February 1981. Its last public performances were an appearance on BBC Television's Oxford Road Show (with Idol wearing cross-dressing stage clothes of a male neo-Gothic high collared coat combined with female knickers and black-tights), and a gig recorded live by BBC Radio at the Paris Theatre in London on 7 January 1981.\n\nIdol and James parted company in February 1981 (with some discord from James' corner, with an unnamed party briefing the music press that the premature end of Gen X had been brought about due to a \"chemical imbalance\"), after Gen X's ex-manager Bill Aucoin advised Idol to relocate from London to New York City. James went on to form and perform with the rockabilly/cyberpunk act \"Sigue Sigue Sputnik\", with which he returned to the British charts in the late 1980s, with a single and a long-player entering the Top 10. Idol left England with a solo artist contract from Chrysalis Records to start anew in the United States of America, taking Gen X's single \"Dancing with Myself\" as a calling card, where during the 1980s he became one of the most commercially successful pop/rock stars that originated from the 1970s Punk Rock movement.\n\nOn 20 September 1993, during the England leg of Idol's \"No Religion\" tour, the late 1970s Generation X reformed for a one-off performance at the Astoria Theatre in London's West End.\n\nOn 30 October 2018, Billy Idol and Tony James along with Steve Jones and Paul Cook, formerly of the Sex Pistols, performed a free entry gig at The Roxy in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, under the name \"Generation Sex\", playing a combined set of the two former bands' material. Entrance tickets were allotted to applicants via a lottery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1802608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802608", "title": "Bernard Rimland", "text": "Bernard Rimland\n\nBernard Rimland (November 15, 1928 – November 21, 2006) was an American research psychologist, writer, lecturer, and influential person in the field of developmental disorders. Rimland's first book, \"Infantile Autism\", sparked by the birth of a son who had autism, was instrumental in changing attitudes toward the disorder. Rimland founded and directed two advocacy groups: the Autism Society of America (ASA) and the Autism Research Institute. He promoted several since disproven theories about the causes and treatment of autism, including vaccine denial, facilitated communication, chelation therapy, and false claims of a link between secretin and autism.\n\nRimland completed his undergraduate studies and earned a master's degree in psychology at San Diego State University. He obtained his Ph.D. in experimental psychology and research design, from Pennsylvania State University in 1953.\n\nUpon completion of his doctorate, Rimland and his wife moved back to San Diego. Rimland worked as a psychologist at the Point Loma Naval Station, where he remained until 1985.\n\nAfter the birth of his son, Mark, and his subsequent diagnosis of autism around the age of 2, Rimland began researching the disorder. The prevailing theory in the 1950s was that autism was the reaction of children to mothers who were \"cold and distant\". Rimland's personal experience contradicted this idea of \"refrigerator mothers\" and he began searching for alternative explanations.\n\nIn 1964, Rimland published his book, \"Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior.\" In the book, Rimland asserted that autism was not a psychological manifestation caused by unfeeling parents, a widely held belief popularized by Bruno Bettelheim. Instead, Rimland suggested, autism was a result of biochemical defects \"triggered by environmental assaults\". He acknowledged that there may also be a genetic component predisposing children to the disorder. Rimland argued that autism could \"be treated—or at least ameliorated—with biomedical and behavioral therapies.\" \"Infantile Autism\" challenged the medical establishment's perceptions of autism. Rimland's message resonated with parents and, after the book was published, he began getting calls and letters from people who wanted to share their stories and ask for advice.\n\nIn 1965, Rimland founded the Autism Society of America (ASA), a parent advocacy organization, to \"work on behalf of autistic children and their families at local, state and national levels.\"\n\nIn 1967, Rimland left the ASA to established the Autism Research Institute (ARI), a San Diego-based non-profit organization dedicated to researching and collecting data on autism and related disorders. He kept a database of research and case histories, as well as conducted and sponsored research in an attempt identify the cause of autism and offer effective treatment solutions. Rimland supported Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), a systematic educational approach made popular by Ivar Lovaas. He published an ARI newsletter, which reached an international audience.\n\nRimland was also the editor of the \"Autism Research Review International\", published by ARI, which covers biomedical and educational advances in autism research.\n\nIn 1988, Rimland served as technical advisor on autism for the 1988 movie \"Rain Man\". Rimland suggested giving Raymond Babbitt, the movie's main character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, the extraordinary characteristics of someone with Savant syndrome. Hoffman interviewed Rimland's son, Mark, in preparing for the role. He felt the movie portrayed people with disabilities, and particularly autism, sympathetically. The makers of the movie made a donation of $75,000, intended to go to Rimland's Autism Research Institute. However, the check was made out to the Autism Society of America in error. Rimland sued to get the money returned, but lost in court because he failed to file the lawsuit in time.\n\nDefeat Autism Now! (DAN!), established in 1995, brought together parents, clinicians, and researchers to \"explore and establish effective biomedical interventions.\n\nRimland was outspoken on what he believed to be the major causes for autism: environmental pollutants, antibiotics, and vaccinations. Sometimes, this put him at odds with the established medical community. In a letter to the editor of the Washington Post in 1997, Rimland wrote: \"The reason that the public–and Congress–supports alternative medicine is that conventional medicine, despite its arrogance, is far too ineffective, far too harmful and far too costly. Non-conventional medicine is a rational alternative to a much greater evil–conventional medicine.\"\n\nRimland considered vaccinations to be a \"prime suspect\" in the onset of autism. He maintained that, while not proven, there was a direct link between thiomersal (a mercury-based preservative used in vaccines) and autism. He supported Andrew Wakefield's now discredited suggestion that the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. Rimland contended that the vaccination triggered autism by placing a burden on the immune systems of children between birth and age 2.\n\nRimland linked the increase of late-onset autism during the 1980s with the introduction of the MMR vaccine, a correlation the Center for Disease Control, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Medical Association did not support. He rejected the idea that a diagnosis of autism at or around 18 months, the same time the vaccinations were administered, was coincidental. When the California Department of Health Services, along with studies from England and Finland, reported that the vaccine \"plays little or no role in the disease,\" Rimland stated that it was \"much too early to dismiss the [vaccine] hypothesis\". He remained undeterred when a study by Robert L. Davis, published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found no association between MMR and inflammatory bowel disease, discussed in the Wakefield report, \"nor any evidence that the vaccine triggered acute onset of symptoms.\" In 2004, 10 of the 13 co-authors of the Wakefield study withdrew the original interpretation. The United States Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 2004 report found that, \"the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\"\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), National Health Service (NHS), World Health Organization (WHO), European Medicines Agency (EMEA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and many other national and international medical organizations have issued statements of a similar nature, finding no link between autism and thimerosal based on the evidence currently available from a variety of studies.\n\nRimland supported chelation therapy, a treatment for lead and heavy metal poisoning, for some children with autism. Neither the American Academy of Pediatrics nor Federal Drug Administration (FDA) support the use of chelation for the treatment of autism.\n\nRimland supported research that focused on \"natural, non-toxic ways\" to address symptoms of autism. He believed that vitamins (specifically B-6 and magnesium) and minerals could help change body chemistry and bring about behavioral changes.\n\nRimland advocated the use of secretin, a \"naturally occurring intestinal hormone, saying it was \"possibly the most important discovery in the history of autism. He claimed that children treated with the hormone showed \"sudden and dramatic improvement\". However, researchers in North Carolina and the University of Chicago in separate studies showed that the children receiving treatments with secretin showed \"no more improvement\" than those receiving a placebo. This treatment was not recommended by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nRimland was an early supporter of facilitated communication (FC) (now discredited), though he disputed founder Douglas Biklen's claims that autism was \"fundamentally a motor problem\". Rimland said, \"How is it possible that an autistic kid can pick up the last tiny crumbs of potato chips off a plate but not have sufficient motor coordination to type the letter E?\"\n\nAt first, Rimland claimed the technique was effective for \"a small number of people\", but far fewer than the 100% success rate claimed by some proponents. He advocated \"properly conducted research\" to determine whether correct answers could be obtained if the facilitator did not know the answers.\n\nAs FC generated false claims of abuse (about 25 by his count in 1993), mostly against parents, Rimland's view of FC's usefulness changed to one of caution. \"In almost every instance of this sort, when charges have come to court and been investigated, courts have decided that they were untrue.\"\n\nRimland became a \"vigorous critic\" of FC after \"more than two dozen 'blind' trials, showed the people with autism being facilitated \"typed the names of objects that only the facilitators had been shown.\" In 1995, Rimland reported that peer-reviewed studies (40+) with more than 400 people with autism as subjects had \"failed to document FC in all but a handful of cases.\" As a result, in 1994, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association noted in their position statements that \"there is no scientific proof that communication via a facilitator is valid.\"\n\nRimland was born on November 15, 1928 in Cleveland, Ohio. He and his family moved to San Diego, California in 1940.\n\nIn 1951, Rimland married Gloria Belle Alf. They had three children. Mark, born in 1956, exhibited challenging behaviors which Rimland self-diagnosed through research as autism. This condition, relatively unknown at the time, was confirmed by a pediatrician.\n\nAt the age of 78, Rimland died of prostate cancer on November 21, 2006 at a care facility in El Cajon, California.\n\n"}

The Schönborn family had knightly rank and was first mentioned in 1275. However, by the time Johann Philipp grew up, most branches of the family had extinguished, and in fact, he and his brother were the last sprouts of the family. \nIn 1621, after it had been ascertained that he possessed the minimum quarters of nobility required, he was admitted as a minor canon (domizellar) by the cathedral chapter of Wurzburg Cathedral, and in 1625 by the cathedral chapter of Mainz Cathedral as well. In 1626, he received consecration in Mainz. He became a cathedral canon of Würzburg in 1629 and of Worms in 1630. He was elected prince-bishop of Wurzburg on 8 September 1642 and archbishop-elector of Mainz on 19 November 1647.\n\nHis diplomatic skills made him an important mediator during the Peace of Westphalia negotiations that ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648. As a result he was elected Archbishop of Mainz in 1647, thus also ruler of the Electorate of Mainz and archchancellor of the Holy Roman empire. In 1663 he also received the prince-bishopric of Worms. He was an effective administrator of his principalities and was able to bring back economic recovery. He fortified the city of Mainz with the Fortress of Mainz and Mainz Citadel between 1655 and 1675. He also founded hospitals and high schools. His court was a center of German politics in the post-war era. \n\nHe made his brother Philip Erwein (1607-1668) a Vogt in the Electorate of Mainz where the latter acquired the castles of Gaibach in 1650, of Geisenheim in 1654 and of Heusenstamm (where he built a new castle) in 1661. The family thus shifted its focus from its regions of origin (in modern Hesse), which had become predominantly protestant, to the catholic ecclesiastical principalities of the empire, located in Franconia and on the Rhine.\n\nHe died in Würzburg in 1673 and was interred in Mainz Cathedral.\n\nJohann Philipp was the first of six members of the Schönborn family who, in the course of more than three generations, were to rule over eight of the most prestigious ecclesiastical principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, giving the name \"Schönbornzeit\" to an era (1642–1756) sometimes nostalgically remembered in the popular conscience as an era of prosperity. Today, the term \"Schönbornzeit\" denotes a particular style of Rhenish and Franconian baroque. His contemporaries gave him the honorable titles of \"The Wise\", \"The German Solomon\", and \"The Cato of Germany\".\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "1802627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802627", "title": "Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz", "text": "Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz\n\nStanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz (, ; 12 November 1883 – 28 November 1940) was a notable general, military commander and veteran of World War I, the Russian Civil War, the Estonian War of Independence, the Polish-Bolshevik War and the Invasion of Poland at the start of World War II.\n\nStanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz was born 10 February 1883 in Meyszty, a small village in the Novoalexandrovsky Uyezd of the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Ignalina District Municipality in Lithuania). Stanisław had two brothers and six sisters. His parents were servants to a local landlord of Belarusian ethnicity.\n\nFollowing Stanisław's birth, his father left the landlord's service and acquired a small estate in Stakavievo near Vilnius.\n\nAfter attending an agricultural school for four years in Belmontas, Bułak-Bałachowicz worked as an accountant, and in 1904 became a manager at the Count Plater's estates in Horodziec and Łużki.\n\nAt the time, he had a reputation as a defender of the less fortunate and was often an arbitrator in disputes between the farmers and their landlord. As a result of these activities he acquired the nickname \"Daddy\" (Bat'ka). His other nickname—\"Bulak\"— became part of his surname. It means 'cloud' (another source offering the translation 'a man who is driven by the wind') in the Belarusian language.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I and Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolayevich's address to the Polish people, Bułak-Bałachowicz joined the Russian Imperial army. As a person of noble roots, he was drafted as an ensign to the 2nd Leyb-Courland Infantry Regiment. However, unlike many of his colleagues who were awarded the basic NCO grades for their noble ancestry only, Bułak-Bałachowicz proved himself as a skilled field commander and was quickly promoted. By December 1914, only four months after he entered the army, he was given command over a group of Cossack volunteers, of whom he formed a cavalry squadron. Together with the 2nd Cavalry Division he fought on the western front, most notably in the area of Sochaczew near Warsaw.\n\nDuring the German summer offensive of 1915, Warsaw was taken by the Central Powers and Bułak-Bałachowicz's unit was forced to retreat towards Latvia.\n\nOn November 1915, Bułak-Bałachowicz was assigned to the special partisan regiment in Northern front headquarters as a squadron commander. His regiment under the command of colonel Punin L. took action in the Riga area. For their audacious actions partisans were nicknamed \"Knights of Death\".\n\nHis unit was formed of four cavalry platoons: one of Cossack light cavalry, one of hussars, one of uhlans and one of dragoons. Thanks to the versatile and flexible structure of his unit, Bułak-Bałachowicz managed to continue the fight behind the enemy lines until 1918.\n\nFor the German campaign Bułak-Bałachowicz was decorated with six Russian decorations and three Crosses of St. George (2nd, 3rd, and 4th degree).\n\nOn 5 March 1918, unaware of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed only two days before, the unit commanded by Bułak-Bałachowicz got engaged in a skirmish against a German unit near the village of Smolova. Although the enemy unit was severely defeated, forced to retreat and abandon its staff behind, Bułak-Bałachowicz was seriously wounded after being shot in the left lung. Transported to Saint Petersburg, Bułak-Bałachowicz quickly recovered and rejoined with his brother, Józef Bułak-Bałachowicz. The latter got involved in the creation of a Polish cavalry detachment commanded by ensign Przysiecki. The Bolsheviks disbanded the unit soon after its formation, executed its commander and started to persecute its members. However, with a help of French military mission a Polish cavalry detachment was finally created and Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz became its commander. The new unit received Leon Trotsky's recognition and was soon reinforced with non-Polish volunteers from all over Russia and was planned as a cavalry division of the Red Army.\n\nSoon after its creation, Bułak-Bałachowicz was ordered to quell the so-called \"Baron Korff Revolt\" in the area of the city of Luga. With his regiment (the unit was still not completely formed) he reached the area and pacified the peasant unrest without the use of force. He was immediately called in to Saint Petersburg by his superiors, but was afraid of being arrested. Because of that, Bułak-Bałachowicz with his cavalry regiment deserted and moved across the Bolshevik lines to the area of Pskov, held by the joint forces of White Russian Northern Army and various German anti-Bolshevik units. Initially the unit fought against the Reds on the White side, but soon conflicts with the German officials arose and Bułak-Bałachowicz had to switch sides yet again. Together with his battle-hardened unit he disarmed the German units surrounding him and broke to the rear of the Red-held territory. From there he fought his way across the fronts to Estonia, where he finally joined the forces of General Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich's Northwestern Army. A skilled commander, Bułak-Bałachowicz added greatly to the Estonian victories in the battles of Tartu, Võru, and Vastseliina, and was soon promoted to lieutenant colonel.\n\nOn 10 May 1919, Bałachowicz was given the command over an \"assault group\" and was ordered to drive it to the rear of the Bolshevik lines. Three days later his forces took the town of Gdov by surprise and on 29 May Bałachowicz entered Pskov. For this action he was promoted to colonel by General Yudenich himself. Because of his victories, his subordinates (mostly Belarusian, Cossack, and Polish volunteers) nicknamed him ataman, though some preferred to use the term \"Bat'ko\" – father.\n\nBułak-Bałachowicz became the military administrator of Pskov. He personally ceded most of his responsibilities to a democratically elected municipal duma and focused on both cultural and economical recovery of the war-impoverished city. He also put an end to censorship of press and allowed for creation of several socialist associations and newspapers, which enraged White generals towards him. Finally, Bułak-Bałachowicz entered in contact with Estonian officers and Poles who were trying to reach the renascent Polish Army, which was seen by Bałachowicz's superiors as a sign of lack of loyalty. After Pskov was yet again lost to the Bolsheviks in mid-July, general Yudenich ordered Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz to be arrested even though only a few days earlier he promoted him to major general (a move Yudenich undertook with hopes of appeasing Bułak-Bałachowicz and encouraging greater subordinance).\n\nHowever, once again Bułak-Bałachowicz evaded being captured. He handed over his division to his brother Józef and, together with 20 of his friends, left for Estonian-controlled Ostrov. There he once again created a partisan unit. With 600 men he broke through the Red Army front and started to disrupt its supply lines. Despite Yudenich's hostility towards Bułak-Bałachowicz, the latter cooperated with White Russian units during their counter-offensive in the autumn of 1919. His unit captured the railway node in Porkhov and broke the Pskov-Polotsk rail road, which added greatly to the White Russian's initial success. On 5 November 1919 his unit yet again entered the area between Pskov and Ostrov and destroyed the three remaining railway lines linking Pskov with the rest of Russia. However, Yudenich's army could not link up with the areas controlled by Bułak-Bałachowicz and their assault was finally broken.\n\nOn 22 January 1920, general Yudenich signed an order of dissolution of his badly-beaten army. On 28 January general Bułak-Bałachowicz, together with several Russian officers and the Estonian police arrested him. A large amount of money was found with him (roughly 227.000 pounds, 250.000 Estonian marks and 110.000.000 Finnish marks) was given to the soldiers of the disbanded army as a last salary, which greatly added to Bałachowicz's popularity amongst them.\n\nSince 1918, Bałachowicz was in contacts with the representatives of the Belarusian Democratic Republic (BDR) in the Baltic states. On 7 November 1919, the government of the BDR agreed to finance Bałachowicz's unit and on 14 November, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz received his Belarusian citizenship and applied for official service for the Belarusian Democratic Republic. His unit was officially renamed to \"Special Unit of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in the Baltics\" (), received Belarusian uniforms and a seal. The unit issued its own field postal stamps and engaged in a few minor battles with the Bolsheviks.\n\nIn February 1920 Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz contacted Józef Piłsudski through the Polish envoy to Riga and proposed to ally his unit with the Polish Army against the Bolshevist Russia. As the fame of the general preceded him, Piłsudski agreed and soon afterwards Bułak-Bałachowicz with some 800 cavalrymen set off for yet another of his great odysseys. After leaving Estonia, they outflanked the Red Russian lines and rode several hundred kilometres behind the enemy lines to Latvia, where they were allowed to pass through Latvian territory. Finally by mid-March they reached Dyneburg (now Daugavpils, then under Polish military administration), where they were greeted as heroes by Józef Piłsudski himself.\nTransferred to Brześć Litewski, the Bułak-Bałachowicz's unit was reformed into a \"Bułak-Bałachowicz Operational Group\", sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"Belarusian-Lithuanian Division\". It was composed mostly of Belarusian volunteers, as well as veterans of the Green Army and former Red Army soldiers, and received the status of an allied army. Because of the composition of his troops, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz is sometimes referred to as a Belarusian.\n\nFormally independent, the division was one of the most successful units fighting in the ranks of the Polish Army during the Polish-Bolshevik War. The unit entered combat in late June 1920 in the area of Polesie Marshes. On 30 June Bułak-Bałachowicz once again broke through the enemy lines and captured the village of Sławeczno in today's Belarus, where the tabors of the Soviet 2nd Rifle Brigade were stationed. The enemy unit was caught by surprise and suffered heavy losses. On 3 July the enemy unit was completely surrounded in the village of Wieledniki and was annihilated. After that action, the Operational Group was withdrawn to the main lines of the Polish 3rd Army and after 10 July it defended the line of the Styr river against Red Army actions.\n\nOn 23 July, during the Bolshevik offensive towards central Poland, general Bałachowicz's group started an organised retreat as a rear guard of the Polish 3rd Army. During that operation, Bułak-Bałachowicz abandoned the withdrawing Polish troops and stayed with his forces for several days behind the enemy lines only to break through to the Polish forces shortly afterwards. During the Battle of Warsaw overnight of 14 August Bałachowicz's forces were ordered to start a counter-attack towards the town of Włodawa, one of the centres of concentration of the advancing Russian forces. On 17 August the area was secured and the Bułak-Bałachowicz's forces defended it successfully until 7 September against numerically superior enemy forces. Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz organised an active defence and managed to disrupt the concentration of all enemy attacks before they could be started. For instance on 30 August and 2 September his forces, supported by the Polish 7th Infantry Division, managed to attack the Soviet 58th Rifle Division from the rear, before it could attack the town of Włodawa.\n\nOn 15 September the unit was yet again advancing in pursuit of the withdrawing Red Army. That day the unit captured Kamień Koszyrski, where it took more than 1000 prisoners of war and the matériel depot of an entire division. During the Battle of the Niemen River Bałachowicz's unit prevented the enemy from forming a defensive line in Polesie. Overnight of 21 September his unit outflanked and then destroyed completely the Bolshevik 88th Rifle Regiment near the town of Lubieszów. Perhaps the most notable victory of the Bułak-Bałachowicz's Group took place on 26 September, when his forces took Pinsk in the rear. The city was the most important rail road junction in the area and was planned as the last stand of the Bolshevik forces still fighting to the west of that city. According to a book published in 1943, after Bułak-Bałachowicz's troops entered Pinsk, they may have committed a series of pogroms on the Jewish population. There were hundreds of victims of rape and murder in Pinsk and in the vicinity around that time, although none specifically linked to Bułak-Bałachowicz.\n\nIn October Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz was stationed with his forces in Pinsk, where they received supplies and a large amount of former Red Army soldiers who were taken prisoner of war after the Battle of Warsaw and volunteered for the service in anti-Bolshevik units. The unit was to re-enter combat in November, but on 12 October a cease fire was signed. On the insistence of both the Entente and Bolshevik Russia, the allied units were to leave Poland before 2 November. General Bułak-Bałachowicz was given the choice of either being interned in Poland with his units and then sent home or to continue the fight against the Reds on his own. He chose the latter option, just like most other White Russian and Ukrainian units fighting on the Polish side in the Polish-Bolshevik War.\n\nOn 2 November 1920, his units were renamed the Russian People's Volunteer Army and transferred to the areas that were to be abandoned by the Polish Army and become a no-man's-land until the final Russo-Polish peace treaty was signed. Three days later his forces crossed into Russian-held Belarus and started an offensive towards Homel. General Bułak-Bałachowicz was hoping for a Belarusian all-national uprising against Bolshevik Russia. His forces initially achieved a limited success and captured Homel and Rechytsa.\n\nOn 10 November 1920 Bułak-Bałachowicz entered Mozyr. There, two days later, he again proclaimed the independence of the Belarusian Democratic Republic with himself as the head of state. Bułak-Bałachowicz declared the exiled Rada BNR as dismissed and started forming a new Belarusian National Army. On 16 November 1920 he also created the Belarusian Provisional Government. However, the planned uprising gained little support in the Belarusian nation, worn tired by six years of constant war and the Red Army finally gained an upper hand. On 18 November 1920 Bałachowicz abandoned Mozyr and started a withdrawal towards the Polish frontier. The Belarusian troops, hardened by the years spent behind the enemy lines, fought their way to Poland and managed to inflict heavy casualties on the advancing Russians while suffering negligible losses, but were too weak to turn the tide of war.\n\nRepresentatives of Balachowicz participated in the organization and conduction of the Slutsk Defence Action that started in late November around Slutsk.\n\nOn 28 November the last organised unit under his command crossed the Polish border and was subsequently interned. The Soviet Russian government demanded that General Bułak-Bałachowicz be handed over to them and tried for high treason. The Riga Peace Conference was even halted by these demands for several days, but eventually these claims were refuted by the Polish government which argued that Bułak-Bałachowicz was a Polish citizen since 1918.\n\nShortly after the Riga Peace Treaty had been signed, Bułak-Bałachowicz and his men were set free from the internment camps. The general retired from the army and settled in Warsaw. There he became an active member of various veteran societies. Among other functions, he held the post of the head of Society of Former Fighters of the National Uprisings. He was also a political essayist and writer of two books on the possibilities of a future war with Germany: \"Wojna będzie czy nie będzie\" (\"Will There Be War or Will There Be None\"; 1931) and \"Precz z Hitlerem czy niech żyje Hitler\" (\"Down With Hitler or Long live Hitler?\", 1933). Between 1936 and 1939 he served as an advisor to Franco's nationalists in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nDuring the Polish Defensive War of 1939, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz volunteered for the Polish army. He created a Volunteer Group that fought in the defence of Warsaw. The unit consisted of approximately 1750 ill-equipped infantrymen and 250 cavalrymen. It was used on the southern flank of the Polish forces defending the Polish capital and adopted the tactics its commander knew perfectly well: fast attacks on the rear of the enemy forces. On 12 September 1939, the unit entered combat for the first time. It took the German defenders by surprise and retook the southernmost borough of Służew and the Służewiec horse track. Soon afterwards the cavalry organised a disrupting attack on the German infantry stationed in Natolin. On 23 September the unit was transferred to northern Warsaw, where it was to organise an assault on the German positions in the Bielany forest. The assault had been prepared, but was thwarted by the cease-fire signed on 27 September.\n\nAfter the capitulation of Warsaw, general Bułak-Bałachowicz (formally retired) evaded being captured by the Germans and returned to civilian life. At the same time he was the main organiser of (\"Military Confederation\"), one of the first underground resistance groups in German and Soviet-occupied Poland. In early 1940 the Gestapo found out his whereabouts. He was surrounded with a group of young conspirators in a house in Warsaw's borough of Saska Kępa and arrested by the Germans. According to the most common version, Bułak-Bałachowicz, was shot by Gestapo agents on 10 May 1940, in the Warsaw centre, on the intersection between Francuska and Trzeciego Maja streets.\n\nFor his resistance against Bolshevik forces that killed local Belarusian peasantry, members of the Belarusian minority in Poland regard him as their national hero. Historians have often seen him to be an adventurer.\n\nBałachowicz is honoured by a number of influential historians and politicians in Belarus and among the Belarusian diaspora as a fighter for the country's independence. Members of the Belarusian diaspora in Poland have been organizing bike rallies to commemorate Bałachowicz.\n\n\n\n"}

As Archbishop of Mainz, he was also Archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire. Lothar Franz von Schönborn is known for commissioning a number of Baroque buildings, such as the palace \"Schloss Weissenstein\".\n\nLothar Franz was born in Steinheim am Main, now a suburb of Hanau, on 4 October 1655 to Count (1607-1668) and Maria Ursula von . He was a nephew of Johann Philipp von Schönborn, Archbishop of Mainz from 1647 until 1673, and a grand nephew of Georg Friedrich von Greiffenklau, Archbishop of Mainz from 1626 until 1629. Furthermore, he was an uncle to the Schönborn-Buchheim branch which included Johann Philipp Franz, Friedrich Karl, Damian Hugo Philipp and Franz Georg.\n\nHe was educated at the Jesuit College in Aschaffenburg. In 1665 Lothar Franz was appointed \"Domizellar\" (canon) of Würzburg Cathedral, 1667 in Bamberg Cathedral. He received a prebendary at Mainz Cathedral in 1674. Lothar Franz made his Grand Tour through the Netherlands, France and Italy. His \"Biennium\" (two-year period of preparation) he attended from 1673 to 1675 in Vienna. During this time he kept a pro-imperial life stance. He was appointed canon of Bamberg in 1681 and in Würzburg in 1683. For the Bishop of Bamberg, he travelled in various diplomatic missions and was appointed President of the Court Chamber. In 1689 he was \"Scholastikus\" (schoolmaster) and curator in Bamberg and canon of Mainz. Still being a canon, he already influenced the artistic design of \"Schloss Gaibach\" at Volkach after 1694.\n\nIn 1693, Lothar Franz was elected Bishop of Bamberg. In September 1694 he was appointed coadjutor bishop of Anselm Franz von Ingelheim in rivalry to Franz Ludwig von Pfalz-Neuburg. Despite an opposing recommendation by the Emperor he succeeded Anselm Franz in 1695. During his reign, he increased taxation of the cathedral chapter and eroded some of its rights. In 1707 he was instrumental in the conversion of the Protestant Elizabeth Christina of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel to Catholicism. \n\nIn 1711 he ensured the election of Charles VI of Austria as the Holy Roman Emperor, and crowned him in Frankfurt Cathedral. Lothar Franz was rewarded by Charles for his loyalty with 100,000 guldens with which he began the construction of \"Schloss Weißenstein\" in Pommersfelden, a Baroque palace with the largest privately owned art gallery of Germany, still today owned by the Schönborn family. He also built the of the bishops at Bamberg (1697-1703) and at Mainz (1700-1722). In 1726, Charles VI granted Palanok Castle with Mukacheve, Chynadiyovo and 200 villages in the Kingdom of Hungary (today part of the Ukraine), to Elector Lothar Franz who had sent him troops to defeat Francis II Rákóczi, whose property it had previously been, and then continued to give the emperor political support. The estate, one of the largest in Eastern Europe, remained in the family well into the 20th century.\n\nLothar Franz von Schönborn died on 30 January 1729 at Mainz.\n\n"}

From 1982 to 1990, Unum abandoned many insurance products, including medical insurance, individual life insurance, general investment contracts, and individual annuities and pensions. Under the leadership of then-CEO James Orr, the company turned its focus to long-term group disability insurance.\n\nIn March 1990, Unum acquired National Employers Life Assurance Holdings, which at the time was the United Kingdom's largest disability insurer. The company later acquired Duncanson & Holt, a reinsurer and insurance underwriter for the accident and health insurance sectors. In 1993, Unum acquired the Colonial Companies, parent company of Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company. Colonial focused on individual insurance products, including accident, cancer and life insurance policies. Unum began offering individual disability policies under the Unum brand once again in 1995.\n\nThe Provident companies was founded in Chattanooga, Tennessee in May 1887 as Mutual Medical Aid and Accident Insurance Company. The company originally specialized in providing both medical-aid and accident insurance to employees in high-risk industries, including miners and coal workers. Within a few months, the company’s founders became concerned that a single disease epidemic would bankrupt the company. Mutual Medical Aid and Accident purchased back all outstanding medical-aid policies and reincorporated as Provident Accident Insurance Company. Provident only issued accident policies.\n\nIn 1892, Thomas Maclellan and John McMaster purchased a 50% stake in the company for $1000. The two men purchased the remaining 50% equity in 1895 and Maclellan was the company's sole owner and president by 1900. Maclellan reorganized the company from being mutually held to a stock company in 1910.\n\nThomas Maclellan served as president of Provident until he was struck by an automobile and unexpectedly died 1916. Robert Maclellan, the son of Thomas, assumed the presidency of Provident following his father's death. Provident began selling life insurance the following year, in 1917, and the first life insurance policy issued by the company covered Robert Maclellan's life. The company also began offering railroad insurance.\n\nProvident wrote its first group policy in 1924. The company expanded its operations with its 1926 acquisition of Detroit, Michigan-based Standard Accident Company. Provident operated in 34 states by 1928. It also acquired Southern Surety Company in 1931 and Meridian Insurance of West Virginia in 1938. The company expanded into Canada in 1948.\n\nIn November 1993, J. Harold Chandler became president and chief executive officer of Provident. Chandler had previously served as a senior executive at NationsBank. Chandler initiated a company-wide restructuring at Provident, which included the 1995 sale of its health-related business to Healthsource for $231 million. Provident also increased its focus on individual disability and life policies with the 1997 acquisition of the Paul Revere Corporation, a Worcester, Massachusetts-based provider of individual disability insurance, from Textron for $1.2 billion. The purchase of Paul Revere made Provident the nation's largest provider of individual disability policies.\n\nUnum and Provident announced their intention to merge in November 1998. When the merger was completed in 1999, the new company, named UnumProvident, was the United States' largest disability insurance provider. Then-Unum chairman and chief executive James Orr was retained in as chairman and CEO of UnumProvident, which was headquartered in Portland, Maine.\n\nCompany Chief Operating Officer J. Harold Chandler, who had served as Provident's chief executive prior to the merger, succeeded Orr as UnumProvident CEO in November 1999. The company sold Provident National Assurance, a holding company for its life insurance and variable annuity business, to Allstate in 2001. In 2002, UnumProvident relocated its headquarters from Portland, Maine to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The former Provident Companies was headquartered in Chattanooga.\n\nUnum received negative attention in 2002, when California regulators fined Unum, and alleged that the company inappropriately denied long-term disability insurance claims. Unum stated that \"only 2% of the policyholders who filed a claim with the company last year [2001] were found not to be disabled, an amount consistent with prior experience.\"\n\nUnumProvident acquired Sun Life Financial's United Kingdom-based group insurance business in 2003. Thomas Watjen replaced Orr as UnumProvident’s chief executive later that year. The company also sold its Japanese and Argentine businesses.\n\nIn 2004, Unum entered into a regulatory settlement agreement (RSA) with insurance regulators in over 40 states. The settlement related to Unum's handling of disability claims and required the company \"to make significant changes in corporate governance, implement revisions to claim procedures and provide for a full re-examination of both reassessed claims and disability insurance claim decisions after the January 2005 effective date of the RSA.\" The review was completed in 2008, and resulted in a 41.7% reversal, \"in whole or part\", and an additional $676.2 million of benefits paid nationwide by Unum. The state of Maine press release announcing the result, praised regulators for their work, and the company for coming into compliance.\n\nIn 2007, UnumProvident was renamed Unum. The Unum moniker was last used by the Unum Corporation prior to the 1999 merger. In 2012 and 2013, Unum partnered with the Consumer Federation of America to release reports which examined the use of disability insurance by American workers. According to numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that were cited by the report, two-thirds of American workers do not carry disability insurance policies. In addition, the report found that, among other things, workers know little about disability insurance, despite expecting financial hardship if they were to become unable to work.\n\nThe company was involved with the UK's controversial Welfare Reform Bill in 2007 and was investigated by the BBC in England at that time.\n\nIn 2008 Unum opened their IT centre of excellence in Carlow, Republic of Ireland.\n\nUnum is headquartered in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The company has additional offices in Portland, Maine; Columbia, South Carolina; Worcester, Massachusetts; Glendale, California; Milton Court, Dorking, Surrey, England; and at Carlow, Co. Carlow, Ireland. Thomas Watjen served as Unum president and chief executive from 2003 until his retirement in 2015. Watjen became Chairman of the Unum Board of Directors on May 21, 2015. He was succeeded as President and CEO by Richard McKenny.\n\nUnum is divided into three business segments: Unum US, Unum UK and Colonial Life. It provides disability insurance, as well as group benefits, life insurance and other services.\n\n\n\n"}

After completing his studies in communication sciences Musumeci began working as a banker at the UniCredit group a global banking and financial services company.\n\nFollowing his stint as a banker he began his career as a journalist. In the 1980’s Musumeci also taught at the Istituto Supreriore di Giiornalismo in Catania. Later Musumeci became one of the founders of the Istituto siciliano di Studi Politici ed economici.\n\nAt the age of twenty he served as a municipal councilor in his home town of Militello in Val di Catania. Soon he became Deputy Mayor of Gravina di Catania and Castel de Judica.\n\nIn 1990 he was elected Provincial Councilor of Catania and in 1994 as a member of the MSI and not yet forty he became President of the province of Catania. In 1995 Musumeci joined the National Alliance Party and represented the region as a Member of the European Parliament in Brussels.\n\nCommitted to fighting crime Musumeci became president of the regional anti-mafia commission. Between the years 1995-2001 and again between 2005-2006 Musumeci received several threats from the mafia and was forced to live under guard.\n\nHe is the founder and the current leader of Diventerà Bellissima, a regionalist party of Sicie anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) candidate Giacarlo Canceller received 36.6% and ly, after having left National Alliance in 2005, and founded Sicilian Alliance. He ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of the Sicilian Region in 2006 obtaining 5.3% of the votes, and again in 2012 when he came second with 25.7%.\n\nMusumeci place in 2008 was on the infamous 666 seat in Strasbourg. He was a substitute for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, substitute for the delegation to the EU-Turkey joint parliamentary committee.\n\nIn November 2017 Musumeci won the Sicilian Regional Election with 39.9% of the vote. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) candidate Giacarlo Canceller received 36.6% and the center-left candidate Fabrizio Micari representing the Democratic Party received 18.6%. Musumeci also secured a majority in the regional assembly when his center-right coalition which received 36 of 70 seats.\n\nMusumeci won the election with the support of Silvio Berlusconi, founder of the center-right party Forza Italia (FI), who campaigned heavily for him in the runup to the election. Former PM Berlusconi, who was forced from office in 2011 due to the euro crisis and scandal of bunga bunga, promised the citizens of Sicily everything from a bridge over the Massina Straight to a casino in Taormina. Following Musumeci’s victory he claimed to “fight for Italy and show what we can do”.\n\nBesides battling crime Musumeci is grappling with pressing regional issues including the effects of climate change and devastating earthquakes on the Island. Sicily has been experiencing major weather events that have impacted the coast in Palermo recently. Musumeci will need to decide what to do with the inadequate infrastructure and those left homeless. Also, the community in Catania centered around Mount Etna has fallen victim to recent earthquakes that left many injured. The new President is also addressing the promised bridge across the Messina Straight.\n\n\n\n"}

Although she was never officially worshipped, she was mentioned in various hymns and passages of the Book of the Dead.\n\nAs goddess of the deceased, she lived in a tree looking out at the entrance to the Duat (Underworld). Her main job, other than being a minor fertility goddess, was to offer food and drink to the newly dead, which would restore their spirits enough to travel to the \"field of reeds\" which was essentially paradise in Ancient Egyptian religion, however, she was so closely linked with Hathor and Isis in their afterlife roles that she may be less an independent deity than an alternate form of those two goddesses.\n\nShe was usually depicted as a queen in robes wearing the hieroglyph for \"west\" on her head and a sceptre and an ankh in her hands. She often appears in tombs welcoming the deceased into the afterlife, sometimes with wings, and sometimes as a Kite because of her connection to Isis and Nephthys.\n\nHer title \"She of the West\" is not just a statement related to geography, but also related as her role in mythology because, as the sun sets towards the west, it was to be accompanied by death, which was where Imentet usually reigned.

The degree of coherence is the normalized correlation of electric fields. In its simplest form, termed formula_1, it is useful for quantifying the coherence between two electric fields, as measured in a Michelson or other linear optical interferometer. The correlation between pairs of fields, formula_2, typically is used to find the statistical character of intensity fluctuations. First order correlation is actually the amplitude-amplitude correlation and the second order correlation is the intensity-intensity correlation. It is also used to differentiate between states of light that require a quantum mechanical description and those for which classical fields are sufficient. Analogous considerations apply to any Bose field in subatomic physics, in particular to mesons (cf. Bose–Einstein correlations).\n\nThe normalized first order correlation function is written as: \nwhere formula_4 denotes an ensemble (statistical) average. For non-stationary states, such as pulses, the ensemble is made up of many pulses. When one deals with stationary states, where the statistical properties do not change with time, one can replace the ensemble average with a time average. If we restrict ourselves to plane parallel waves then formula_5.\nIn this case, the result for stationary states will not depend on formula_6, but on the time delay formula_7 (or formula_8 if formula_9).\n\nThis allows us to write a simplified form\n\nwhere we now average over \"t\".\n\nIn optical interferometers such as the Michelson interferometer, Mach–Zehnder interferometer, or Sagnac interferometer, one splits an electric field into two components, introduces a time delay to one of the components, and then recombines them. The intensity of resulting field is measured as a function of the time delay. In this specific case involving two equal input intensities, the visibility of the resulting interference pattern is given by:\n\nwhere the second expression involves combining two space-time points from a field.\nThe visibility ranges from zero, for incoherent electric fields, to one, for coherent electric fields. Anything in between is described as partially coherent.\n\nGenerally, formula_13 and formula_14.\n\nFor light of a single frequency (e.g. laser light): formula_15\n\nFor Lorentzian chaotic light (e.g. collision broadened): formula_16\n\nFor Gaussian chaotic light (e.g. Doppler broadened): formula_17\n\nHere, formula_18 is the central frequency of the light and formula_19 is the coherence time of the light.\n\nThe normalised second order correlation function is written as:\n\nNote that this is not a generalization of the first-order coherence\n\nIf the electric fields are considered classical, we can reorder them to express formula_2 in terms of intensities. A plane parallel wave in a stationary state will have\n\nThe above expression is even, formula_23. For classical fields, one can apply the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the intensities in the above expression (since they are real numbers) to show that formula_24. The inequality formula_25 shows that formula_26. Assuming independence of intensities when formula_27 leads to formula_28. Nevertheless, the second-order coherence for an average over fringes of complementary interferometer outputs of a coherent state is only 0.5 (even though formula_29 for each output). And formula_2 (calculated from averages) can be reduced down to zero with a proper discriminating trigger level applied to the signal (within the range of coherence).\n\nNote the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect uses this fact to find formula_32 from a measurement of formula_33.\n\n\n\nA generalization of the first-order coherence\n\nA generalization of the second-order coherence\n\nor in intensities\n\nLight of a single frequency: \n\nUsing the first definition:\nChaotic light of all kinds: formula_43\n\nUsing the second definition:\nChaotic light of all kinds: formula_44\nChaotic light of all kinds: formula_45\n\nThe predictions of formula_46 for \"n\" > 1 change when the classical fields (complex numbers or c-numbers) are replaced with quantum fields (operators or q-numbers).

{"id": "1802673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802673", "title": "Roadside memorial", "text": "Roadside memorial\n\nA roadside memorial is a marker that usually commemorates a site where a person died suddenly and unexpectedly, away from home. Unlike a grave site headstone, which marks where a body is laid, the memorial marks the last place on earth where a person was alive – although in the past travelers were, out of necessity, often buried where they fell.\n\nUsually the memorial is created and maintained by family members or friends of the person who died. A common type of memorial is simply a bunch of flowers, real or plastic, taped to street furniture or a tree trunk. A handwritten message, personal mementos, etc. may be included. More sophisticated memorials may be a memorial cross, ghost bike, or a plaque with an inscription, decorated with flowers or wreaths.\n\nRoadside memorials tend to be clustered along the busiest roadways and often at intersections.\n\nRoadside memorials are a statement of grief and love from the loved ones of the accident victim or victims.\n\nBut apart from their personal significance, these memorials also serve as a reminder and warning to other road users of the dangers of driving, and to encourage safer driving. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Arizona Highway Patrol began using white crosses to mark the site of fatal car accidents. This practice was continued by families of road-crash victims after it had been abandoned by the police. The ghost bike phenomenon, where an old bicycle is painted white and locked up at an accident site, serves the same purpose in relation to cycling casualties.\n\nHistorically, roadside memorials were personal memorials, but there is a modern trend toward public memorials of increasingly large size. Typically little or no effort is made to make the memorials accommodate the natural beauty of the landscape and many roadside memorials, over time, lack proper maintenance.\n\nThe phenomenon of roadside memorials may be associated with another growing trend: public outpouring of grief for celebrities. The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, for example, precipitated an avalanche of flowers and wreaths at the Pont de l'Alma road tunnel in Paris, the site of her death, and at Kensington Palace, her home in London. While car-crash victims are rarely so well known, something of the same sort of impulse to make a public display of emotion at the site of a tragedy may be partly responsible for the growing popularity of roadside memorials. The broad phenomenon of creating improvised and temporary memorials after traumatic death (accidents, murder, disasters etc.) has become popular since the 1980s. Because of their non-institutionalized character they are generically coined as grassroots memorials.\n\nRoadside memorials have been erected around the world for centuries. Their legality varies from country to country.\n\nThe number of memorials erected in Australia since 1990 has increased considerably. In 2003, it was estimated that one in five road deaths were memorialized at the site of the crash.\n\nIt is traditional in Ukraine to place a roadside memorial on the site of a deadly car or motorcycle crash. It is usually a cross or a small monument with a wreath of flowers. There are also usually fresh flowers regularly placed by the cross if the relatives of the person who died live close enough to look after the memorial. Sometimes Ukrainian roadside memorials can be more elaborate, including a small granite or marble gravestone and/or a picture of the loved one.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the practice of erecting roadside memorials has recently generated a media debate about the danger these memorials may pose to other road users and to people erecting them in unsafe places. This debate has been sparked by accounts of dangerous actions, such as when an adult crosses a main road with a child to place a tribute. Some jurisdictions already enforce local regulations, and police officials and local councilors have suggested that uniform rules be introduced across the country. For example, according to the BBC, in Merthyr Tydfil, memorials will only be allowed where it is deemed safe and appropriate, and they will be removed after three months.\n\nThe spread of spontaneous roadside memorials to mark the site of fatal traffic accidents in the United States is a relatively new phenomenon. There is a gravestone-style memorial in Ellington, CT marking a child's death in 1812. A typical memorial includes a cross (usually wooden), flowers, hand-painted signs, and, in the case of a child's death, stuffed animals.\n\nThe spread of roadside memorials in the United States has increased in recent decades as a result of large immigrant populations from Mexico entering the country . And while not limited to Mexican populations, roadside memorials are most common in areas with large Mexican populations. Formerly, in funerary processions where a group would proceed from a church to a graveyard carrying a coffin, the bearers would take a rest, or \"descanso\" in Spanish, and wherever they set the coffin down, a cross would be placed there in memory of the event. The modern practice of roadside shrines commemorate the last place a person was alive before receiving fatal injuries, even if they should actually die in a hospital after the crash.\n\nIn the southwestern United States, they are also common at historic parajes on old long distance trails, going back to the roots of the tradition, and also marked the graves of people who died while traveling. A descanso memorial may be decorated especially for the holidays, and for significant anniversaries in the person's life. A descanso memorial for a child may be decorated with special toys, even toy vignettes of family life, and votive candles may be placed there on special nights.\n\nIn the United States, the legal situation varies from state to state.\n\nIn New Mexico, Department of Transportation crews undertaking new construction are not required to protect them, but usually either avoid altering them, or otherwise place them as close to where they originally were as possible once construction has been completed as a courtesy.\n\nIn California, Streets and Highways Code Section 101.10 directs the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to place and maintain memorial signs along state highways that read “Please Don't Drink and Drive” followed by “In Memory of {victim's name}.” Caltrans places signs at the request of victims’ relatives when there is a fatality as a result of an alcohol or drug-impaired driver. The signs are to remain in place for a period of seven years. The department shall charge the requesting party a fee to cover the department’s cost in designing, constructing, placing, and maintaining that sign, and the department’s costs in administering this section.\n\nThe states of Colorado, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and Wisconsin ban such memorials.\n\nIn the state of Delaware, roadside memorials are illegal per the Clear Zone Act for safety reasons. As an alternative to roadside memorials, the Delaware Highway Memorial Garden located at the Smyrna Rest Area consists of a path with bricks bearing the names of people who died along roads in Delaware. Other states impose specific requirements for roadside memorials.\nIn Birmingham, Alabama, roadside memorials have been removed from Interstate highways. Some people view unauthorized street memorials as illegal and think they constitute the taking of public property for private purposes, and are also a distraction and therefore dangerous to the motoring public. Others think they serve as a sort of public service announcement that reminds drivers to be careful and drive safely, and are no more distracting than any other roadside advertisement. For anyone but those close to the death, they may do little but clutter the landscape. If the memorial is located on a road that the loved ones seldom or never travel, or in a remote area, it may be seen as a form of grandstanding.\n\nUsing a Christian cross as a memorial along a public highway can be seen as an illegal endorsement of religion and has been challenged in a growing number of lawsuits by secular groups concerned about the separation of church and state. On 18 August 2010 the Tenth Circuit held that the State of Utah violated the Establishment Clause of the Constitution by constructing a series of 12-foot high Latin crosses along the roadside to memorialize fallen state troopers. In Lake Elsinore California, a personal roadside cross was removed following a complaint by the American Humanist Association.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his stint with World Wrestling Entertainment on the Raw brand as one half of The Heart Throbs.\n\nMatera made his debut in late 2001 under the name Antonio Thomas, and quickly became a mainstay on the New England independent circuit. Over the next few years, he wrestled for several promotions, including New England Championship Wrestling, Chaotic Wrestling, and the Eastern Wrestling Alliance (EWA).\n\nIn early 2003, Thomas began training with Rick Harrison, and began working for Bradley's Wrestling Federation of America (WFA) promotion. There he won the WFA Heavyweight Championship, and held it throughout most of 2003-2004.\n\nThomas then began teaming with his long-time friend Romeo Roselli, who was wrestling as Johnny Heartbreaker, and the pair formed a tag team called The Heartbreakers. On January 23, 2004, The Heartbreakers defeated Cueball and Nick McKenna to become the EWA Tag Team Champions.\n\nIn July 2004, Thomas signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). In OVW he continued to team with Heartbreaker, but it was not until February 2005 that Heartbreaker was officially signed to a developmental contract with WWE.\n\nOn April 18, 2005, William Regal and Tajiri successfully defended the World Tag Team Championships against the debuting Heart Throbs (Thomas and Heartbreaker, now known simply as Antonio and Romeo respectively). They went on to participate in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship at the 2005 Backlash pay-per-view, although they were unsuccessful.\n\nThe Heart Throbs, who have portrayed heels, mainly appeared on the \"Raw\" B-show, \"Heat\". They had short-lived feuds with Eugene and William Regal, Rosey and The Hurricane, and V-Squared (Val Venis and Viscera).\n\nDuring the first episode of \"Heat\" in 2006 the pair turned face and began educating the crowd by bringing two \"hot chicks\" into the ring and getting them to read a book.\n\nOn February 10, 2006, WWE announced that The Heart Throbs had been released from their contracts.\n\nAfter his release from WWE, Thomas returned to working on the New England independent circuit.\n\nOn May 27, 2006, Thomas debuted for MXW and pinned Jason Blade after the match was interrupted by Romeo Roselli.

{"id": "1802675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802675", "title": "Kathleen Ni Houlihan", "text": "Kathleen Ni Houlihan\n\nKathleen Ni Houlihan (, literally, \"Kathleen, daughter of Houlihan\") is a mythical symbol and emblem of Irish nationalism found in literature and art, sometimes representing Ireland as a personified woman. The figure of Kathleen Ni Houlihan has also been invoked in nationalist Irish politics. Kathleen Ni Houlihan is sometimes spelled as Cathleen Ni Houlihan, and the figure is also sometimes referred to as the Sean-Bhean Bhocht (pron. Shan Van Vukt), the Poor Old Woman, and similar appellations. Kathleen Ni Houlihan is generally depicted as an old woman who needs the help of young Irish men willing to fight and die to free Ireland from colonial rule, usually resulting in the young men becoming martyrs for this cause. In the days before the Anglo-Irish War, the colonial power was the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. After the Anglo-Irish War, Kathleen Ni Houlihan was a figure more associated with the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland, especially during the Troubles.\n\nAs a literary figure, Kathleen Ni Houlihan was featured by William Butler Yeats and Lady Augusta Gregory in their play \"Cathleen Ní Houlihan\". Other authors that have used Kathleen Ni Houlihan in some way include Seán O'Casey (especially in \"The Shadow of the Gunman\") and James Joyce who introduces characters named Kathleen and Mr Holohan in his story \"A Mother\" (in \"Dubliners\") to illustrate the ideological shallowness of an Irish revival festival.\n\nKathleen Ni Houlihan is generally portrayed as an old woman without a home. Frequently it is hinted that this is because she has been dispossessed of her home which comprised a farmhouse and \"four green fields\" (symbolising the four provinces of Ireland). In Yeats and Gregory's \"Cathleen Ní Houlihan\" (1902), she arrives at an Irish family's home as they are making preparations for the marriage of their oldest son. In Yeats and Gregory's play, Kathleen Ni Houlihan tells the family her sad tale, interspersed with songs about famous Irish heroes that had given their life for her. She ultimately lures the young groom away to join in the failed Irish Rebellion of 1798 against the British during the French Revolutionary Wars. After the groom makes his decision and leaves, one character notes that the old woman has become a beautiful young woman with the walk of a queen. Yeats and Gregory's treatment of Kathleen Ni Houlihan is fairly typical of this myth. The groom's choice – and eventual death in the failed rebellion – rejuvenates Kathleen Ni Houlihan to some degree.\n\nRichard Kearney (1988, p. 218) suggests that the Kathleen Ni Houlihan myth represents the view that the blood sacrifice of heroes is needed to free and redeem Ireland. At the same time, these heroic sacrificial martyrs are rewarded by being \"remembered for ever\" (Kearney, p. 218). This nationalist sacrificial mythology can be tied to pagan concepts of \"seasonal rejuvenation\" and the sacrificial aspects of Christianity in the Crucifixion and tradition of martyrdom (Kearney, p. 220). This use of sacrificial martyrdom can also be seen in various hunger strike used by Irish Republican Army prisoners in the 1980s and other periods (Kearney, ch. 11).\n\nThe figure of Kathleen Ni Houlihan has appeared in several folk songs and poems. Ethna Carbery's \"The Passing of the Gael\" (1906), which was a sentimental treatment of the Irish diaspora during the 19th century (partly because of the Great Famine of that period), suggested that Irish emigrants longed for their homeland. Carbery refers to Kathleen Ni Houlihan by name as the personification of Ireland that the emigrants miss.\n\nSeán O'Casey's \"The Shadow of the Gunman\" (1923) quotes the last line of Carbery's \"The Passing of the Gael,\" as the character Seumas Shields complains about various aspects of Irish culture. O'Casey's treatment of the myth is generally viewed as ironic or sardonic.\n\nIrish poet Seamus Heaney has suggested that the character of Sarah in Brian Friel's \"Translations\" (1980) can be seen as a Kathleen Ni Houlihan-like figure desperately trying to regain her voice and identity.\n\nArnold Bax's classical tone poem, influenced from his time in Ireland also assumes the name Cathleen-Ni-Houlihan.\n\nSee Tommy Makem's Celtic/folk song, \"Four Green Fields.\n\nIn James Joyce's \"Dubliners\" the selection \"A Mother\" contains the character Kathleen whose mother \"determined to take advantage of her daughter's name\" during the Celtic Revival.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's 2011 Irish state visit, on arrival at Casement Aerodrome, the tune “The Walk of a Queen,” was played by the march of the Irish military band, it was written by a composer called Bill Whelan. The title of the song had an ulterior meaning as it was choosen from the closing lines of W.B Yeats 1902 play, used to describe Cathleen ni Houlihan at the end of the play when she returns to a young women.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1802693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802693", "title": "Caliche", "text": "Caliche\n\nCaliche () is a sedimentary rock, a hardened natural cement of calcium carbonate that binds other materials—such as gravel, sand, clay, and silt. It occurs worldwide, in aridisol and mollisol soil orders—generally in arid or semiarid regions, including in central and western Australia, in the Kalahari Desert, in the High Plains of the western USA, in the Sonoran Desert and Mojave Desert, and in Eastern Saudi Arabia at Al-Hasa. Caliche is also known as calcrete or kankar (in India). It belongs to the duricrusts. The term \"caliche\" is Spanish and is originally from the Latin \"calx\", meaning lime.\n\nCaliche is generally light-colored, but can range from white to light pink to reddish-brown, depending on the impurities present. It generally occurs on or near the surface, but can be found in deeper subsoil deposits, as well. Layers vary from a few inches to feet thick, and multiple layers can exist in a single location.\n\nIn northern Chile and Peru, \"caliche\" also refers to mineral deposits that include nitrate salts. Caliche can also refer to various claylike deposits in Mexico and Colombia. In addition, it has been used to describe some forms of quartzite, bauxite, kaolinite, laterite, chalcedony, opal, and soda niter.\n\nA similar material, composed of calcium sulfate rather than calcium carbonate, is called gypcrust.\n\nCaliche generally forms when minerals leach from the upper layer of the soil (the A horizon) and accumulate in the next layer (the B horizon), at depths around 3 to 10 feet under the surface. It generally consists of carbonates in semiarid regions—in arid regions, less-soluble minerals form caliche layers after all the carbonates have been leached from the soil. The deposited calcium carbonate accumulates—first forming grains, then small clumps, then a discernible layer, and finally, a thicker, solid bed. As the caliche layer forms, the layer gradually becomes deeper, and eventually moves into the parent material, which lies under the upper soil horizons.\n\nHowever, caliche also forms in other ways. It can form when water rises through capillary action. In an arid region, rainwater sinks into the ground very quickly. Later, as the surface dries out, the water below the surface rises, carrying up dissolved minerals from lower layers. This water movement forms a caliche that tends to grow thinner and branch out as it nears the surface. Plants can contribute to the formation of caliche, as well. Plant roots take up water through transpiration, and leave behind the dissolved calcium carbonate, which precipitates to form caliche. It can also form on outcrops of porous rocks or in rock fissures where water is trapped and evaporates. In general, caliche deposition is a slow process, but if enough moisture is present in an otherwise arid site, it can accumulate fast enough to block a drain pipe.\n\nWhile the formation of other caliches is relatively well understood, the origin of Chilean caliche is not clearly known. One possibility is that the deposits were formed when a prehistoric inland sea evaporated. Another theory is that it was deposited due to weathering of the Andes.\n\nOne of the world's largest deposits of calcrete is in the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana, where surface calcretes occur at the location of a now-desiccated prehistoric lake.\n\nCaliche is used in construction worldwide. Its reserves in the Llano Estacado in Texas can be used in the manufacture of Portland cement; the caliche meets the chemical composition requirements and has been used as a principal raw material in Portland cement production in at least one Texas plant. Where the calcium carbonate content is over 80%, caliche can also be fired and used as a source of lime, which can then be used for soil stabilization.\nWhen mixed with small amounts of either pozzolan or Portland cement, caliche can also be used as a building material that exceeds building code requirements for unfired masonry materials. For example, caliche was used to build some of the Mayan buildings in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. A dormitory in Ingram, Texas, and a demonstration building in Carrizo Springs, Texas, for the United States Department of Energy were also built using caliche as part of studies by the Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems.\n\nIn many areas, caliche is also used for road construction, either as a surfacing material, or more commonly, as base material. It is one of the most common road materials used in Southern Africa. Caliche is widely used as a base material when it is locally available and cheap. However, it does not hold up to moisture (rain), and is never used if a hard-rock base material, such as limestone, is available.\n\nA nearly pure source of calcium carbonate is necessary to refine sugar. It must contain at least 95% calcium carbonate (CaCO) and have a low magnesium content. In addition, the material must meet certain physical requirements so it does not break down when burned. Although caliche does not generally meet all of the requirements for sugar refining, it is used in areas where another source of calcium carbonate, such as limestone, is not present. While caliche requires beneficiation to meet the requirements, its use can still be significantly cheaper than shipping in limestone.\n\nIn the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, vast deposits of a mixture, also referred to as \"caliche\", are composed of gypsum, sodium chloride and other salts, and sand, associated to \"salitre\" (\"Chile saltpeter\"). \"Salitre\", in turn, is a composite of sodium nitrate (NaNO) and potassium nitrate (KNO). \"Salitre\" was an important source of export revenue for Chile until World War I, when Europe began to produce both nitrates industrially in large quantities.\n\nThese deposits are the largest known natural source of nitrates in the world, containing up to 25% sodium nitrate and 3% potassium nitrate, as well as iodate minerals, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and sodium borate (borax). The caliche beds are from 0.2 to 5.0 m thick, and they are mined and refined to produce a variety of products, including sodium nitrate (for agriculture or industry uses), potassium nitrate, sodium sulfate, iodine, and iodine derivatives.\n\nCaliche beds can cause problems for agriculture. First, an impermeable caliche layer prevents water from draining properly, which can keep roots from getting enough oxygen. Salts can also build up in the soil due to the lack of drainage. Both of these situations are detrimental to plant growth. Second, the impermeable nature of caliche beds prevents plant roots from penetrating the bed, which limits the supply of nutrients, water, and space so they cannot develop normally. Third, caliche beds can also cause the surrounding soil to be basic. The basic soil, along with calcium carbonate from the caliche, can prevent plants from getting enough nutrients, especially iron. An iron deficiency makes the youngest leaves turn yellow. Soil saturation above the caliche bed can make the condition worse.\n\nA caliche layer with the presence of calcium carbonates indicates alkaline or high-pH conditions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1802694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802694", "title": "Mes Aynak", "text": "Mes Aynak\n\nMes Aynak (Pashto/Persian: , meaning \"little source of copper\"), also called Mis Ainak or Mis-e-Ainak, is a site southeast of Kabul, Afghanistan, located in a barren region of Logar Province. Mes Aynak contains Afghanistan's largest copper deposit, as well as the remains of an ancient settlement with over 400 Buddha statues, stupas and a monastery complex. Archaeologists are only beginning to find remnants of an older 5,000-year-old Bronze Age site beneath the Buddhist level, including an ancient copper smelter.\n\nThe site of Mes Aynak possesses a vast complex of Buddhist monasteries, homes, and market areas. The site contains artifacts recovered from the Bronze Age, and some of the artifacts recovered have dated back over three thousand years. The site's orientation on the Silk Road has yielded a mixture of elements from China and India. The wealth of Mes Aynak’s residents has been well represented in the site's far-reaching size and well guarded perimeter. Afghanistan’s eagerness to unearth the copper below the site is leading to the site's destruction rather than its preservation. Archaeologists have photographed the site and the relics excavated.\n\nThe word \"Mes Aynak\" () literally means \"little source of copper\"; \"mis\" () is \"copper\", while \"aynak\" () is a diminutive form of \"ayn\" (), which means \"source\".\n\nDuring the 10th century the city was ruled by Brahman Shahi king of Kabul, Jaypaldeva. But it was burned to ashes by Gaznavaid invasion. Once these walls broken, it was easy for Gaznavi to Across Hindi Kush and invade main land India. The citizen of Mes Ayank follwed Buddhism and Shiva equally. As the name suggests, the presence of copper at Mes Aynak has been known about for some time, while the site's archaeological wealth has been known about since exploration by Russian and Afghan geologists in 1973-4. The earliest Buddhist remains date from the Kushan era, although these gradually gave way to T'ang Chinese and Uyghur influences. Mes Aynak was at the peak of its prosperity between the fifth and seventh century AD. A period of slow decline began in the eighth century, and the settlement was finally abandoned 200 years later.\n\nOn 17 May 2020, the Taliban attacked a security checkpoint near the Mes Aynak mine. Eight security guards were killed and five others wounded.\n\nIn November 2007, a 30-year lease was granted for the copper mine to the China Metallurgical Group (MCC) for US$3 billion, making it the biggest foreign investment and private business venture in Afghanistan’s history. Allegations have persisted that the then-minister of mines obstructed the contracting process and accepted a large bribe to eliminate the other companies involved in the bid.\n\nThe Afghan Mining Ministry estimates that the mine holds some six million tons of copper (5.52 million metric tons). The mine is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars, and to generate jobs and economic activity for the country, but threatens the site's archaeological remains. The site is accessed via a motorable track from the surfaced road between Kabul and Gardez. The mining lease holders propose to build a railway to serve the copper mine.\n\nAs of July 2012, MCC has not developed an environmental impact plan, and has remained secretive about feasibility studies, and the plan regarding the opening and closing of the mine, as well as any guarantees contained in the contract. International experts have warned that the project, and other similar projects in Afghanistan, could be threatened because MCC has not fulfilled promises made to the Afghan government, such as the lack of provision of proper housing for relocated villagers. Other investments that have yet to be fulfilled include a railway, a 400-megawatt power plant and a coal mine. A report by Global Witness, an independent advocacy group that focuses on natural resource exploitation, said there was a \"major gap\" between the government's promises of transparency and its follow-through.\n\nArchaeologists believe that Mes Aynak is a major historical heritage site. It has been called \"one of the most important points along the Silk Road\" by French archaeologist, Philippe Marquis. There are thought to be 19 separate archaeological sites in the valley including two small forts, a citadel, four fortified monasteries, several Buddhist stupas and a Zoroastrian fire temple, as well as ancient copper workings, smelting workshops, a mint, and miners habitations. In addition to the Buddhist monasteries and other structures from the Buddhist era that have already been identified, Mes Aynak also holds the remains of prior civilizations likely going back as far as the 3rd century BC. Historians are particularly excited by the prospect of learning more about the early science of metallurgy and mining by exploring this site. It is known to contain coins, glass, and the tools for making these, going back thousands of years. \n\nAll of this historical material is in imminent danger of destruction by the mining endeavor. In response to negative reports in the press comparing the Chinese mining company to those who destroyed the Buddhas of Bamiyan, a plan for minimal archaeological excavation was put in place. This plan still foresees the destruction of the site and everything still buried beneath it, but it does allow for the removal of whatever artifacts can be carried away by a small archaeological team led by DAFA, the French archaeological mission to Afghanistan.\n\nBetween May 2010 and July 2011 archaeologists excavated approximately 400 items; more than what the National Museum of Afghanistan housed before the war. The site covers roughly , encompassing several separate monasteries and a commercial area. It appears that Buddhists who began settling the area almost two millennia ago were drawn by the availability of copper. More recently, a stone statue, or stele, found in 2010 has been identified as a depiction of Prince Siddhartha before he founded Buddhism and has been taken to support the idea that there was an ancient monastic cult dedicated to Siddhartha's pre-enlightenment life.\n\nIn June 2012, a conference of experts in the fields of geology, mining engineering, archaeology, history and economic development met at SAIS in Washington, D.C to assess the situation in Mes Aynak. The provisional findings were tentatively encouraging: because of the length of time before mining can actually start at the site (approximately five years), it is indeed possible for collaboration between archaeologists and mining engineers to work to save Mes Aynak's cultural treasures. The site could either become a positive model for mineral extraction working to preserve cultural heritage or become an irreparable failure. However, a number of measures, that are not currently in place, must be met first. The site is still scheduled for destruction in January 2013.\n\nExcavators at Mes Aynak have been denounced as \"promoting Buddhism\" and threatened by the Taliban and many of the Afghan excavators who are working for purely financial reasons don't feel any connection to the Buddhist artifacts.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kabul has provided a million dollars of U.S. military funding to help save the Buddhist ruins. As of June 2013 there is an international team of 67 archaeologists on site, including French, English, Afghans and Tajiks. There are also approximately 550 local labourers, which is set to increase to 650 in the summer. When this occurs Mes Aynak will become \"the largest rescue dig anywhere in the world\". All these personnel are protected by 200 armed guards. The team are using ground-penetrating radar, georectified photography and aerial 3D images to produce a comprehensive digital map of the ruins.\n\nThe rescue work was continuing as of June 2014, in spite of difficulties. There were only 10 international experts working at the site, and fewer than 20 Afghan archaeologists from Kabul’s Institute of Archaeology. A team of seven Tajik archaeologists was also helping. Marek Lemiesz, a senior archaeologist at the site, said that more help was needed. Security was also a concern.\n\nThere were also indications that mining plans were being delayed because of the declining copper prices.\n\nA documentary titled \"Saving Mes Aynak\", directed by Brent E. Huffman, tells the story of the archaeological site, as well as the dangerous environment the mine has created for archaeologists, Chinese workers, and local Afghans. The film follows several main characters, including Philippe Marquis, a French archaeologist leading emergency conservation efforts; Abdul Qadeer Temore, an Afghan archaeologist at the Afghan National Institute of Archaeology; Liu Wenming, a manager for the China Metallurgical Group Corporation; and Laura Tedesco, an American archaeologist working for the U.S. State Department.\n\nIn July 2014 it was announced that \"Saving Mes Aynak\" will be completed by the end of 2014, and is being made with Kartemquin Films.\n\nThe documentary \"Saving Mes Aynak\" premiered at the 2014 IDFA film festival in Amsterdam and in the USA at the 2015 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.\n\nIn April 2015, Brent E. Huffman announced a plan to raise awareness of Mes Aynak through a #SaveMesAynak Global Screening Day and a fundraising campaign.\n\nIn June 2015, the film was offered for free streaming within Afghanistan.\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin (BA 1786, MA 1789, BD 1797, DD 1801), where he had been a Scholar (1784), and was elected fellow in 1788. He was appointed Erasmus Smith Professor of Mathematics (and Senior Fellow) in 1800, and in 1813 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society as \"a gentleman of high distinction for mathematical & philosophical knowledge & Author of several works of importance\". Thought not a research mathematician, he was a popular teacher at TCD and was well-liked by students. \n\nHe had been ordained into the Church of Ireland in 1790, and two of his sermons (preached in the college chapel in 1798 and 1799) formed form the basis of his Discourses on the Scriptural Doctrines of Atonement and Sacrifice (1801), a polemic against Unitarian theology, which was answered by Lant Carpenter.

In 1822 the Archbishop of Dublin was translated to Armagh, and Magee succeeded him at Dublin. Though in most respects a tolerant man, he steadily opposed the movement for Catholic Emancipation. He gained notoriety for prohibiting the Catholic inhabitants of Glendalough from celebrating Mass \"as they had theretofore done in their ancient and venerated cathedral of St. Kevin\".\n\nHe died on 19 August 1831 at Stillorgan, near Dublin.

He rose to the top of the JPWA ranks after defeating top-ranked Damian \"Lionheart\" Campari. Heartbreaker went on to have the JPWA's longest undefeated streak until, after losing an arm wrestling challenge to Biff Backstreet, Backstreet challenged him to a match and was victorious. At the demise of the JPWA in 2002, Heartbreaker had the 3rd highest number of wins, behind Sasha \"The Russian Skullcrusher\" and Campari. Roselli also appeared for the video-based BG East Wrestling as \"Johnny Romano\".\n\nWith JPWA closing, Johnny Heartbreaker started wrestling for New Era Pro Wrestling. While there, he formed a tag team with Mike Preston called the VIP. On July 13, 2002, they won the vacant NEPW United States Tag Team Championship which they would hold until they vacated the titles in March 2003.\n\nIn 2003, Johnny Heartbreaker formed a tag team with Antonio Thomas called the Heart Breakers.

He also served as \"Reichsvizekanzler\" (Vice-Chancellor) of the Holy Roman Empire from 1705 to 1734.\n\nFriedrich Karl (Carl) von Schönborn was born in Mainz on 3 March 1674, the second son of (1644-1717, see List of rulers of Schönborn) and his wife, Maria Anna Sophia von Boineburg (1652–1726). \n\nFriedrich Karl was the nephew of Lothar Franz von Schönborn, Archbishop-Elector of Mainz. Friedrich Karl's older brother Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn was one of his predecessors as Prince-Bishop of Würzburg; his younger brother Damian Hugo Philipp von Schönborn became Prince-Bishop of Speyer and his youngest brother Franz Georg von Schönborn became Archbishop-Elector of Trier.\n\nIn 1681, he was sent to study at the Jesuit school at Aschaffenburg. He became a \"\" at Würzburg in 1683 and at Bamberg in 1685. He then studied alongside his brother Johann Philipp Franz at Würzburg, Mainz, Aschaffenburg and Rome (Germanicum). His Grand Tour brought him to the Netherlands, England and France. He finished his studies at the Sorbonne. He received the minor orders in 1701. In 1703/4, his uncle Lothar Franz sent him as envoy for the Archbishopric of Mainz to the imperial court at Vienna. He became a canon of Würzburg Cathedral in 1704, and a canon of Bamberg Cathedral in 1705.\n\nIn 1705, Friedrich Karl became Vice-Chancellor for Emperor Joseph I; he held this post under Joseph and his successor, Charles VI, until 1734. In this position, Friedrich Karl worked to protect the security of the smaller Imperial Estates, and to strengthen imperial authority. He successfully opposed attempts by Prussia to expand its influence in southern Germany. During his early years he spent most of his time at the Imperial court in Vienna. He had the Federal Chancellery of Austria built between 1717 and 1719 as his office. He also supervised the construction of the Imperial Chancellory Wing of the Hofburg Palace in Vienna (1723-30) by Lukas von Hildebrandt, where he lived in an apartment. As his private country resort near Vienna, he built the Blauer Hof Laxenburg (1710-1720) and also the Schönborn Palace near Göllersdorf in Lower Austria; there he also purchased Weyerburg Castle. In 1740 he acquired the Palais Schönborn-Batthyány and moved there. \n\nHe was appointed coadjutor bishop of Bamberg in 1708, with Pope Clement XI confirming his appointment on 19 May 1710. Friedrich Karl's opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction, as well as his frequent absences from Vienna, caused him to lose influence at the court after 1730.\n\nWhen the cathedral chapter of Würzburg elected a new bishop in 1724, they rejected Friedrich Karl, due to the unpopularity of his brother Johann Philipp Franz. Christoph Franz von Hutten was elected Bishop of Würzburg instead. In 1724, Friedrich Karl became \"Dompropst\" at Würzburg and upon his uncle Lothar Franz' death on 30 January 1729, he succeeded as Prince-Bishop of Bamberg. On 18 May 1729 he was elected unanimously as Bishop of Würzburg, after von Hutten had died. Nonetheless he continued to mainly reside in Vienna for a number of years.\n\nFriedrich Karl had been the favourite nephew of Lothar Franz, who bequeathed to him \"Schloss Weissenstein\", a large Baroque palace at Pommersfelden. Among his various residences, Friedrich Karl clearly preferred Würzburg, however.\n\nAs an imperial prince, Friedrich Karl remained a supporter of the Habsburgs, despite numerous and significant political differences. His considered, moderately absolutist, rule served him well in reorganizing administration, finance and education in both bishoprics. In 1735 he helped to turn the \"Bamberger Akademie\" into a full university, by adding law and medical faculties. In 1743 he gave the University of Würzburg new study regulations.\n\nHe implemented the perpetual adoration at Würzburg in 1736. In both bishoprics he built or renovated numerous churches, often using Würzburg engineer Balthasar Neumann. Under him, Neumann also completed the Würzburg Residence (begun under his brother) and the \"Schönbornkapelle\" of Würzburg Cathedral. Friedrich Karl also had Neumann build a new summer residence at Werneck.\n\nHe died on 26 July 1746 at Würzburg and is buried in the \"Schönbornkapelle\" of Würzburg Cathedral.\n"}

P&WC began work on the 900 lbf (4 kN) thrust PW610F engine, destined for the Eclipse 500, in 2002. The engine was certified by the Canadian authorities on the 27 July 2006. The first Eclipse 500 aircraft, powered by two PW610Fs, was delivered to a customer on 31 December 2006.\n\nWith a 14.5 inch (36.83 cm) diameter fan, the PW610F is one of the smallest turbofans to enter production. Little is known about the engine cycle, although the bypass ratio is believed to be about 1.83. Driven by a single-stage low pressure (LP) turbine, the single stage fan is an advanced snubberless design, with wide chord blades integral with the rotor hub. The layout of the high pressure (HP) compressor is shown in U.S. patent 6,488,469: it has 2 stages, a mixed-flow or diagonal and a centrifugal, and is driven by a single-stage turbine. A reverse-flow combustor and forced mixer/common exhaust are also featured in the design. Dual lane Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), for smoother, more reliable, operation, is included in the specification. Hispano-Suiza Canada is currently designing and manufacturing the FADEC for this engine.\n\nThe larger, thrust, PW615F has a 16-inch (40.64 cm) diameter fan, a bypass ratio of 2.8, and is aimed at the Cessna Citation Mustang. This engine was certified in December 2005, with first deliveries in March 2006. The Mustang aircraft was certified on 8 September 2006, and deliveries began in 2007.

In the era of one-platoon football, he played as a center (then a position on both offense and defense) and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963 as part of the first class of inductees. He was also named to the National Football League (NFL) 50th, 75th, and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams.\n\nHein played college football as a center for the Washington State Cougars football team from 1928 to 1930. He led the 1930 Washington State team to an undefeated record in the regular season and received first-team All-Pacific Coast and All-American honors.\n\nHein next played 15 seasons in the NFL as a center for the New York Giants from 1931 to 1945.

He was the starting center on NFL championship teams in 1934 and 1938 and played in seven NFL championship games (1933–1935, 1938–1939, 1941, and 1944).\n\nHein also served as the head football coach at Union College from 1943 to 1946 and as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) from 1947 to 1948, the New York Yankees of the AAFC in 1949, the Los Angeles Rams in 1950, and the USC Trojans from 1951 to 1965. He was also the supervisor of officials for the American Football League from 1966 to 1969 and for the American Football Conference from 1970 to 1974.\n\nHein was born in 1909 at Redding in Shasta County, California. His father, Herman Hein (1886-1940), was a California native of German and Dutch ancestry who worked as an electrician for a power house operator. His mother, Charlotte Hein (1887-1967), was a California native of English and German ancestry. As of 1910, the family was living at Round Mountain, about 30 miles northeast of Redding.\n\nBy 1920, the family was living in Glacier in Whatcom County, Washington, where Hein's father was working as a lineman on transmission lines. Hein had an older brother, Lloyd, and two younger brothers, Homer and Clayton. The family later moved to Fairhaven and Burlington, Washington, where Hein's father worked as an insurance agent and where Hein attended both Fairhaven and Burlington High Schools. He also played basketball as a center at Burlington High.\n\nIn 1927, Hein enrolled at Washington State College (later renamed Washington State University) in Pullman, Washington. He played at the center position for the Washington State Cougars football team from 1928 to 1930. With Hein as the starting center, the Cougars compiled a 10–2 record in 1929 and 9–1 in 1930. The 1930 team won the Pacific Coast Conference championship and went through the regular season without a loss before losing to Alabama in the 1931 Rose Bowl. Hein played all 60 minutes of the Cougars' back-to-back victories over California and USC on October 4 and 11, 1930.\n\nAt the end of his senior year, Hein was selected by the Associated Press and United Press as the first-team center on the 1930 All-Pacific Coast football team. He was also selected by the Central Press as the first-team center, and by the All-America Board in a tie for the first-team center position, on the 1930 College Football All-America Team.\n\nWhile at Washington State, Hein also played for three years (freshman, sophomore, and junior years) on the Washington State Cougars men's basketball team and for one year on the school's track team as a freshman.\n\nIn 1931, Hein signed a contract with the New York Giants, married his college sweetheart, and packed all of their belongings into a 1929 Ford and drove from Pullman to New York. He played for 15 years as a center and a defensive lineman. Hein was a first-team All-Pro center eight straight years from 1933 to 1940.

Hein was also a member of five Giants teams that lost NFL championship games — 1933, 1935, 1939, 1941, and 1944.\n\nHein had planned to retire after a dozen years in the NFL and become the head coach at Union College in Schenectady, New York. When the football program went on hiatus due to World War II, Hein returned to the Giants on weekends for three more seasons and retired after the 1945 season.\n\nHein worked as a football coach and league administrator for more than 30 years. He began coaching in 1943 as the head football coach at Union College in Schenectady, New York. For the next three years, he held that position, though the 1943 and 1945 Union College teams had their seasons cancelled due to the disruption of losing many players to World War II. In 1944, the team compiled an 0–5 record, as Hein coached the team on Saturdays and played for the Giants on Sundays.

However, on November 18, 1947, DeGroot was fired as head coach, and assistant coaches Hein and Ted Shipkey were appointed as co-coaches to lead the team for the final three games of the season. The 1947 Dons compiled a 5-6 record under DeGroot and a 2-1 record under Hein and Shipkey. Hein resumed his position as an assistant coach under Jimmy Phelan on the 1948 Dons team that again compiled a 7-7 record.\n\nAfter two years with the Dons, Hein was hired in February 1949 as an assistant coach for the New York Yankees of the AAFC under head coach Red Strader.

The Yankees' forward wall, which was coached by Hein, was rated as the toughest in the AAFC.\n\nHein returned to Los Angeles in 1950 as the line coach for the Los Angeles Rams. Under head coach Joe Stydahar, the 1950 Rams won the NFL National Conference championship with a 9–3 record but lost to the Cleveland Browns in the 1950 NFL Championship Game.\n\nHein left the Rams in February 1951 to join the USC Trojans football team as its line coach under head coach Jess Hill. Hein remained with the Trojans for 15 years through the 1965 season. During his tenure with the program, the Trojans won a national championship (1962) and four conference championships (1952, 1959 [co-championship], 1962, and 1964 [co-championship]).\n\nIn June 1966, Hein was hired by commissioner Al Davis as the supervisor of officials for the American Football League. He remained in that position from 1966 to 1969 and continued thereafter as the supervisor of officials for the American Football Conference from 1970 to 1974. He retired in May 1974 after more than 45 years in college and professional football.\n\nHein received numerous honors for his accomplishments as a football player.

Based in Kansas City, Missouri, \"NCR\" was founded by Robert Hoyt in 1964. Hoyt wanted to bring the professional standards of secular news reporting to the press that covers Catholic news, saying that \"if the mayor of a city owned its only newspaper, its citizens will not learn what they need and deserve to know about its affairs\". The publication, which operates outside the authority of the Catholic Church, is independently owned and governed by a lay board of directors.\n\nThe paper is published bi-weekly, with each issue including national and world news sections, as well as an opinion and arts section. Each paper runs an average of 32 pages, which includes special sections, a section published in each issue devoted to a particular topic.\n\nEach issue includes news stories, analysis, commentary, opinion and editorials. The Opinion and Arts section contains book and film reviews, as well as spiritual reflections, along with letters to the editor, classifieds and editorials.\n\nThe publication is also printed online at www.ncronline.org.\n\nThe organization reported $4.3 million in annual revenue in 2013. The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation is a major financial supporter of the newspaper. The \"Global Sisters Report\" is a project of NCR. \n\nPromoting a progressive position, \"NCR\" presents itself \"as one of the few, if not the only truly independent, journalistic outlet for Catholics and others who struggle with the complex moral and societal issues of the day.\" Russell Shaw, writing in the supplemental volume of the \"Encyclopedia of Catholic Social Thought, Social Science, and Social Policy\" writes that \"NCR\" \"has been criticized for ideological bias and a tilt in favor of progressive Catholicism and dissent, not only in its editorial and opinion pages but in its news coverage as well, together with an excessive readiness to dispute and oppose statements and actions of the Holy See and the bishops.\"\n\n\"NCR\" has asserted that climate change is the most important pro-life issue facing the Catholic Church.\n\nIn April 1967, \"NCR\" published confidential reports of a commission appointed by Pope Paul VI to review the church's teaching on artificial contraception. The majority of the commission recommended revisions in the teaching. The action was among the reasons Bishop Charles H. Helmsing of Kansas City, Missouri, in 1968, issued a condemnation of \"NCR\" and demanded that it remove the word Catholic from its name. Bishop Helmsing issued a statement condemning \"NCR\", saying it had a \"policy of crusading against the Church's teachings,\" a \"poisonous character\" and \"disregard and denial of the most sacred values of our Catholic faith.\" Because the publication \"does not reflect the teaching of the Church, but on the contrary, has openly and deliberately opposed this teaching,\" he asked the editors to \"drop the term 'Catholic' from their masthead\" because \"they deceive their Catholic readers and do a great disservice to ecumenism by ... watering down Catholic teachings.\"\n\n\"NCR\" did not comply with his request, and 66 Catholic journalists signed a statement disagreeing with the condemnation based on its \"underlying definition of the legitimate boundaries of religious journalism in service to the church.\" The Catholic Press Association reported that the dispute arose from a difference of opinion regarding the function of the press.\n\nIn 2013, Bishop Robert Finn of Kansas City, Missouri, wrote a column in his diocesan newspaper discussing Helmsing's condemnation of \"NCR\".

Fox denied the implication that there was a decades-long animosity between the diocese and the newspaper, noting that Bishop John Sullivan and Bishop Raymond Boland \"had cordial relations with \"NCR\".\" He pointed out that \"NCR\" is a member of the Catholic Press Association of the United States and Canada whose honorary president is Bishop John Wester, who also serves as the chairman of the Committee of Communications of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Fox noted an \"NCR\" editorial in November 2012 had called on Finn to resign or be removed from his position after Finn was found guilty \"of failing to report suspected child abuse involving a local priest.\" Finn did resign from the Diocese of Kansas City on April 21, 2015 after an internal Vatican investigation.\n\n\"NCR\" has won the \"General Excellence\" award from the Catholic Press Association in the category of national news publications six times between 2008 and 2014.\n\nThe Catholic Press Association in June 2017 awarded former \"NCR\" editor and publisher Tom Fox its highest honor for publishers, the Bishop John England Award.\n\n"}

She served one term in the United States House of Representatives, winning an at-large seat in Illinois in 1928. She gave up the chance to run for re-election to seek a United States Senate seat from Illinois. She defeated the incumbent, Senator Charles S. Deneen, in the Republican primary, becoming the first female Senate candidate for a major party. McCormick lost the general election. A decade later, she became the first woman to manage a presidential campaign, although her candidate, Thomas E. Dewey, failed to capture his party's nomination.\n\nPolitics were a part of McCormick's life from an early age. She was the daughter of Mark Hanna, a Senator and politician who was instrumental in the election of President William McKinley. McCormick learned politics by watching her father, and put those lessons to use fighting for causes such as women's suffrage and improved working conditions for women. McCormick was instrumental in passing a partial suffrage law in Illinois in 1913, allowing women to vote in municipal and Presidential elections. She also married two politicians, Senator Joseph Medill McCormick and after he died Congressman Albert Gallatin Simms. McCormick had the fame, the background and the determination to build a career on the new opportunities for women in high level politics. As a spokesperson for the suffrage and for the Republican party, she made political activism attractive for partisan women.\n\nMcCormick's endeavors were not limited to politics. Throughout her life, she maintained an interest in agriculture. She owned and operated ranches in Illinois, New Mexico, and Colorado. She also owned several newspapers, founding the Rockford Consolidated Newspapers in Rockford, Illinois.\n\nRuth Hanna was born on March 27, 1880, in Cleveland, Ohio. She was the third child of businessman and Republican politician Mark Hanna and Charlotte Augusta Hanna (née Rhodes). Her mother descended from a wealthy Vermont coal and iron family. She began riding ponies after her father gave her one as a gift when she was five years old. Instead of riding sidesaddle, as was common for girls at the time, Hanna rode astride the way boys did. She attended Hathaway Brown School in Cleveland, The Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, New York, and the Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut.\n\nHanna's father was a close friend and political ally of Ohio Governor William McKinley, and she would often listen to the pair's political discussions. In 1896, Hanna traveled the country with her father, who was campaigning for then-presidential candidate McKinley while also running his own campaign for the United States Senate. Their stops included Dakota where Hanna stepped in to give a speech for her ill father, and Thomasville, Georgia, where she met her future husband Joseph \"Medill\" McCormick. Both McKinley and Hanna's father won their races, with Hanna's father earning the nickname \"the President Maker\".\n\nBy age 16, Hanna was an avid horseback rider and never wore dresses. She was said to have an independent spirit. A practical joke she played on the McKinleys, in which she pretended to have killed a wildcat on her own, led to reports that Hanna was an avid hunter.\n\nAfter high school, Hanna went to Washington, D.C., to work as a secretary for her father who was serving as United States Senator from Ohio. Her duties included taking notes of events from the Senate Gallery. Her father hosted political breakfasts at their Washington, D.C. home where Hanna would socialize with political elites, including Presidents McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. She was well known in the social circles of Cleveland, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. Although her family was wealthy, Hanna did not limit her friends based on her social station.\n\nIn 1902, Hanna became engaged to Medill McCormick. They were married on June 10, 1903, with President Roosevelt attending the wedding. Like Hanna, Medill was from a well-connected family. His grandfather, Joseph Medill, started the \"Chicago Tribune\", which the family continued to own. Hanna and Medill had three children: Katrina (born 1913), John Medill (born 1916), and Ruth \"Bazy\" (born 1921).\n\nRuth Hanna McCormick relocated to Chicago after marrying, where Medill briefly worked as publisher of the \"Chicago Tribune\". McCormick began working at the paper as well. The McCormicks were a wealthy couple, and their wealth increased when, less than a year after their marriage, McCormick's father died, leaving her one of the primary beneficiaries of her father's $3 million estate. In spite of their personal wealth, the couple lived at the University of Chicago Settlement, which introduced McCormick to many working women and helped her to understand the problems they faced. During their time living in Chicago, McCormick owned a dairy farm to provide untainted milk to locals, as part of the pure foods movement.\n\nBy 1908, McCormick was a member of the Women's Welfare Committee, an organization for helping workers. She was also an active member of the Women's City Club of Chicago, a group that sought to convince lawmakers to pass legislation to help women, but found women's concerns were being pushed aside because they were not voters. This observation led to McCormick becoming a suffragist. In 1911, she and her husband lived in France and Great Britain where they studied European politics. Upon her return to the United States, McCormick joined the Progressive Party in 1912. She had long supported Progressive Party leader Theodore Roosevelt and found the switch to be consistent with the principles of her father, even though he had been a staunch Republican. Her husband also joined the Progressive Party, winning a seat in the Illinois General Assembly in that same year. McCormick served as chairman of the women's welfare section of the National Civil Federation.\n\nMcCormick worked closely with Grace Wilbur Trout to enact partial equal suffrage legislation in Illinois, which gave women the right to vote in municipal and presidential elections. Suffragists in Illinois pursued partial suffrage because full suffrage required a public referendum which activists believed they were likely to lose. Illinois had frequently passed such legislation through one house of the legislature before it ultimately stalled. McCormick adapted techniques she learned from her father to devise a campaign to pressure every member of the legislature. Trout, McCormick, and their associates met with every legislator and were present at the state capital every day of the 2013 legislative session until the measure passed both houses. Governor Edward F. Dunne signed the equal suffrage bill into law on June 26, 1913, gifting McCormick with one of the pens used in the signature. With the enactment of the law, over one million women gained the right to vote, doubling the number of women voters nationwide.\n\nMcCormick remained an active worker for national suffrage until the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1913, she became chairman of the Congressional Committee for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She took over leadership from Alice Paul, who went on to form the Congressional Union as a separate national suffrage organization. The new position had McCormick relocate from Illinois to Washington, D.C., where she promptly found a new headquarters for the Committee. From that headquarters, she was tasked with getting more pro-suffrage candidates elected to state level offices. During her time as leader of the Congressional Committee, McCormick produced the melodrama \"Your Girl and Mine\", which was intended to help gain support for the suffrage movement. The film never circulated broadly, despite critical praise from contemporary film reviewers, because the distribution agreement between NAWSA and the World Film Company fell apart shortly after the premiere in 1914 and the film was confined to private screenings. That same year, McCormick showed solidarity with black activists. McCormick marched alongside Irene McCoy Gaines in a Washington, D.C. suffrage parade, one year after NAWSA had insisted black women march separately. As chair of the campaign committee, McCormick donated a gold elephant to be melted down and sold to help finance suffrage efforts in several states. The elephant had been a gift from members of the Republican National Committee (RNC) to thank McCormick for traveling the country as part of the McKinley campaign.\n\nMedill served one term in the United States House of Representatives before being elected to the United States Senate from Illinois in 1918. McCormick was highly involved in her husband's political career, and he often credited her for his success. In 1918, McCormick served as the chairman of the first woman's executive committee of the RNC. As chair, she devised a plan to get women to become active members of the Republican Party across the country. She resigned from the position after less than a year due to poor health. Next, McCormick became an associate member of the RNC, a position she held from 1919 to 1924. In 1924, she became the first elected national committeewoman from Illinois and served until 1928.\n\nWhen not working on politics, McCormick managed her 1,500-acre farm in Illinois. The farm at Byron, Illinois, served as a model dairy, and it remained open as other similar farms closed for being unprofitable. McCormick and her children spent time at the farm during the summer months.\n\nMedill lost the Republican primary in 1924 to Charles S. Deneen. Months later, on February 25, 1925, as he was preparing to leave office, Medill died. Although not publicized as such at the time, his death was considered a suicide. One of the factors leading to his suicide was his loss in the 1924 election. Medill had returned to Washington, D.C., days before his death, while McCormick stayed behind to spend time with her close friend of 30 years Alice Roosevelt Longworth after the birth of Longworth's first child. In her grief, McCormick considered giving up politics herself. At Longworth's urging, McCormick decided to continue.\n\nTwo months after Medill's passing, McCormick threw herself into working at the Woman's World's Fair as general executive and as a member of the event's Board of Directors. The goal of the event was to demonstrate the progress of women. As part of her responsibilities, McCormick recruited President Calvin Coolidge and First Lady Grace Coolidge to participate in the opening of the Fair.\n\nMcCormick was convinced her husband had lost the primary due to the lack of engagement of Republican women voters. She turned her attention towards organizing Republican women, starting Republican Women's Clubs in 90 of Illinois's 102 counties. McCormick used that newly mobilized voting base when, in 1928, she ran in a heavily contested primary race for one of Illinois's at-large congressional seats. In the April 1928 primary election, she finished in first place in a field of eight candidates, including two sitting Congressmen, to win one of the two Republican nominations. In November 1928, McCormick won first place in the general election with 1.7 million votes, elected along with the incumbent. Her vote total was a larger vote share than any other Republican on the ticket in Illinois, including President Herbert Hoover, and larger than any other member of the House of Representatives that year. McCormick was one of eight women elected to serve in the Seventy-first Congress, and one of three women elected for the first time. By the time she entered Congress, McCormick had built a reputation as an astute politician for her years of working with her husband, and her ability to navigate the factions of Illinois politics.\n\nOnce in Congress, McCormick was appointed to the House Committee on Naval Affairs. She was the first woman to serve on the influential committee. Although she was not placed on the Agriculture Committee, despite her knowledge of farming, she pushed legislation to relieve farm overproduction. McCormick worked to ensure Oscar DePriest, elected to represent First Congressional District of Illinois, was seated over the objections of southerners who wanted to block the seating of an African-American. She supported a proposed amendment to the Census and Reapportionment Bill which aimed to enforce the 14th Amendment by counting disenfranchised individuals of voting age in the census. She also aided constituents who were veterans of the Spanish–American War who were having difficulty with their pensions.\n\nIn September 1929, McCormick announced her intention to run for the Senate against Republican incumbent Charles S. Deneen, who had won the seat from her husband in 1924. She sought the nomination at a time when no woman had ever been elected to the Senate. By October, McCormick had returned to Illinois, visiting the state's various counties to rally support while Deneen was stuck in Washington, D.C., on Senate business. As an Illinois farm owner, McCormick drew support from farmers in the state, particularly those down-state. McCormick also campaigned on her opposition to the World Court. She defeated Deneen in the 1930 Republican primary, 52% to 30%, to become the first female major party nominee for the Senate. The victory showed strong support for McCormick throughout the state, including a surprisingly strong showing in Chicago where she had gained the support of Mayor William Hale Thompson, who also had a rivalry with Deneen. McCormick later testified that the campaign cost $252,572 of her own money, with additional funds being raised from relatives.\n\nFor the general election, McCormick was up against Democratic nominee former Senator James Hamilton Lewis. Lewis previously lost the seat to Medill in 1918. William Thompson, who had supported McCormick in the primary, threw his support to Lewis in the general election. One contentious issue in the campaign was Prohibition, which McCormick supported and Lewis did not. The high cost of McCormick's primary campaign also became a point for attack in the general election, with Lewis accusing McCormick of trying to buy the election. Lewis also made a point not to refer to McCormick by name, instead calling her \"the lady candidate\". McCormick refused to make her gender an issue, calling gender differences a personality issue and insisting political party mattered more in the general election. Unfortunately for McCormick, 1930 was a difficult year for Republican candidates as the stock market crash had occurred the year before. McCormick lost the election, 64% to 31%. Her term in office as a Congresswoman came to an end on March 3, 1931.\n\nIn 1930, McCormick bought all three newspapers in Rockford, Illinois. She then formed Rockford Consolidated Newspapers as the publisher of the \"Rockford Register-Republic\" and the \"Rockford Morning Star\". After leaving Congress, McCormick lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her two youngest children attended school there while Katrina, the oldest, was enrolled in Columbia University. In 1932, she married politician Albert Gallatin Simms, of New Mexico, whom she met when they sat next to each other when they served together in Congress. Simms had lost reelection in 1930 and resided in Albuquerque.\n\nAfter their marriage, McCormick and Simms moved to Los Poblanos, an 800-acre ranch in Albuquerque. McCormick hired John Gaw Meem to add to the existing ranch house on the property, and later to build the La Quinta Cultural Center which included a library, ballroom, art gallery, and swimming pool. Together, Simms and McCormick were one of the richest couples in New Mexico, and they used their fortune for several philanthropic endeavors. They founded Sandia School in 1932 and the Manzano Day School in 1938. McCormick was the second president of the Albuquerque Little Theatre.\n\nMcCormick remained active in Republican Party politics. She became the first woman to serve as chairperson of a convention delegation when she chaired the New Mexico delegation at the 1936 Republican National Convention. In 1937, she sold her dairy farm in Illinois and purchased a 250,000–acre cattle and sheep ranch in Colorado. In June 1938, her son, John Medill, went missing while mountain climbing with a friend in the Sandia Mountains. His body was found in the mountains after several days of searching. Not long after the loss, McCormick fractured her hip, limiting her activities.\n\nEight years after leaving office, McCormick announced her return to politics ahead of the 1940 presidential election. She once again threw herself into politics, co-managing Thomas Dewey's 1940 presidential campaign, becoming the first woman to take on such a role in a presidential campaign. While recovering from her fracture, McCormick had traveled to New York, where she convinced her cousin, \"New York Daily News\" editor Joseph Medill Patterson, to allow her to attend a dinner party where Dewey was a guest. McCormick and Dewey struck up a friendship, and she became an early and ardent supporter of his presidential campaign. With Dewey's loss in the primary, McCormick went on to support Republican presidential nominee Wendell Willkie.\n\nFollowing the Dewey campaign's loss and the conversion of the Sandia Preparatory School into a military hospital, McCormick spent most of her time in Colorado, where she focused on the operation of her ranch. She tried to offer political advice to Dewey as he again sought the presidency in 1944, but he was wary of her isolationism.\n\nIn October 1944, McCormick fell off a horse, resulting in a shoulder injury. Shortly after she was discharged from the hospital, McCormick was diagnosed with pancreatitis. Her pancreas ruptured on December 4 and she died on December 31, 1944, in Chicago. She was buried in Albuquerque. In McCormick's honor, the Albuquerque City and County Commissioners, Albuquerque National Bank, and Manzano Day School all closed for her funeral.\n\nAfter McCormick's death, Albert Simms donated over 12,000 acres of land to the Albuquerque Academy. In 1974, the school opened a fine-arts center named for Simms and McCormick. The Rockford Chamber of Commerce posthumously named McCormick to its Northern Illinois Business Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1802723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802723", "title": "Cayley table", "text": "Cayley table\n\nNamed after the 19th century British mathematician Arthur Cayley, a Cayley table describes the structure of a finite group by arranging all the possible products of all the group's elements in a square table reminiscent of an addition or multiplication table. Many properties of a groupsuch as whether or not it is abelian, which elements are inverses of which elements, and the size and contents of the group's centercan be discovered from its Cayley table.\n\nA simple example of a Cayley table is the one for the group {1, −1} under ordinary multiplication:\n\nCayley tables were first presented in Cayley's 1854 paper, \"On The Theory of Groups, as depending on the symbolic equation \"θ\" = 1\". In that paper they were referred to simply as tables, and were merely illustrativethey came to be known as Cayley tables later on, in honour of their creator.\n\nBecause many Cayley tables describe groups that are not abelian, the product \"ab\" with respect to the group's binary operation is not guaranteed to be equal to the product \"ba\" for all \"a\" and \"b\" in the group. In order to avoid confusion, the convention is that the factor that labels the row (termed \"nearer factor\" by Cayley) comes first, and that the factor that labels the column (or \"further factor\") is second. For example, the intersection of row \"a\" and column \"b\" is \"ab\" and not \"ba\", as in the following example:\n\nCayley originally set up his tables so that the identity element was first, obviating the need for the separate row and column headers featured in the example above. For example, they do not appear in the following table:\n\nIn this example, the cyclic group Z, \"a\" is the identity element, and thus appears in the top left corner of the table. It is easy to see, for example, that \"b\" = \"c\" and that \"cb\" = \"a\". Despite this, most modern textsand this articleinclude the row and column headers for added clarity.\n\nThe Cayley table tells us whether a group is abelian. Because the group operation of an abelian group is commutative, a group is abelian if and only if its Cayley table's values are symmetric along its diagonal axis. The cyclic group of order 3, above, and {1, −1} under ordinary multiplication, also above, are both examples of abelian groups, and inspection of the symmetry of their Cayley tables verifies this. In contrast, the smallest non-abelian group, the dihedral group of order 6, does not have a symmetric Cayley table.\n\nBecause associativity is taken as an axiom when dealing with groups, it is often taken for granted when dealing with Cayley tables. However, Cayley tables can also be used to characterize the operation of a quasigroup, which does not assume associativity as an axiom (indeed, Cayley tables can be used to characterize the operation of any finite magma). Unfortunately, it is not generally possible to determine whether or not an operation is associative simply by glancing at its Cayley table, as it is with commutativity. This is because associativity depends on a 3 term equation, formula_1, while the Cayley table shows 2-term products. However, Light's associativity test can determine associativity with less effort than brute force.\n\nBecause the cancellation property holds for groups (and indeed even quasigroups), no row or column of a Cayley table may contain the same element twice. Thus each row and column of the table is a permutation of all the elements in the group. This greatly restricts which Cayley tables could conceivably define a valid group operation.\n\nTo see why a row or column cannot contain the same element more than once, let \"a\", \"x\", and \"y\" all be elements of a group, with \"x\" and \"y\" distinct. Then in the row representing the element \"a\", the column corresponding to \"x\" contains the product \"ax\", and similarly the column corresponding to \"y\" contains the product \"ay\". If these two products were equalthat is to say, row \"a\" contained the same element twice, our hypothesisthen \"ax\" would equal \"ay\". But because the cancellation law holds, we can conclude that if \"ax\" = \"ay\", then \"x\" = \"y\", a contradiction. Therefore, our hypothesis is incorrect, and a row cannot contain the same element twice. Exactly the same argument suffices to prove the column case, and so we conclude that each row and column contains no element more than once. Because the group is finite, the pigeonhole principle guarantees that each element of the group will be represented in each row and in each column exactly once.\n\nThus, the Cayley table of a group is an example of a latin square.\n\nBecause of the structure of groups, one can very often \"fill in\" Cayley tables that have missing elements, even without having a full characterization of the group operation in question. For example, because each row and column must contain every element in the group, if all elements are accounted for save one, and there is one blank spot, without knowing anything else about the group it is possible to conclude that the element unaccounted for must occupy the remaining blank space. It turns out that this and other observations about groups in general allow us to construct the Cayley tables of groups knowing very little about the group in question.\n\nBecause in any group, even a non-abelian group, every element commutes with its own inverse, it follows that the distribution of identity elements on the Cayley table will be symmetric across the table's diagonal. Those that lie on the diagonal are their own unique inverse.\n\nBecause the order of the rows and columns of a Cayley table is in fact arbitrary, it is convenient to order them in the following manner: beginning with the group's identity element, which is always its own inverse, list first all the elements that are their own inverse, followed by pairs of inverses listed adjacent to each other.\n\nThen, for a finite group of a particular order, it is easy to characterize its \"identity skeleton\", so named because the identity elements on the Cayley table are clustered about the main diagonaleither they lie directly on it, or they are one removed from it.\n\nIt is relatively trivial to prove that groups with different identity skeletons cannot be isomorphic, though the converse is not true (for instance, the cyclic group \"C\" and the quaternion group \"Q\" are non-isomorphic but have the same identity skeleton).\n\nConsider a six-element group with elements \"e\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", and \"f\". By convention, \"e\" is the group's identity element. Because the identity element is always its own inverse, and inverses are unique, the fact that there are 6 elements in this group means that at least one element other than \"e\" must be its own inverse. So we have the following possible skeletons: \n\nIn our particular example, there does not exist a group of the first type of order 6; indeed, simply because a particular identity skeleton is conceivable does not in general mean that there exists a group that fits it.\n\nAny group in which every element is its own inverse is abelian: let \"a\" and \"b\" be elements of the group, then \"ab\" = (\"ab\") = \"b\"\"a\" = \"ba\".\n\nOnce a particular identity skeleton has been decided on, it is possible to begin filling out the Cayley table. For example, take the identity skeleton of a group of order 6 of the second type outlined above:\n\nObviously, the \"e\" row and the \"e\" column can be filled out immediately. Once this has been done, it may be necessary (and it is necessary, in our case) to make an assumption, which may later lead to a contradictionmeaning simply that our initial assumption was false. We will assume that \"ab\" = \"c\". Then:\n\nMultiplying \"ab\" = \"c\" on the left by \"a\" gives \"b\" = \"ac\". Multiplying on the right by \"c\" gives \"bc\" = \"a\". Multiplying \"ab\" = \"c\" on the right by \"b\" gives \"a\" = \"cb\". Multiplying \"bc\" = \"a\" on the left by \"b\" gives \"c\" = \"ba\", and multiplying that on the right by \"a\" gives \"ca\" = \"b\". After filling these products into the table, we find that the \"ad\" and \"af\" are still unaccounted for in the \"a\" row; as we know that each element of the group must appear in each row exactly once, and that only \"d\" and \"f\" are unaccounted for, we know that \"ad\" must equal \"d\" or \"f\"; but it cannot equal \"d\", because if it did, that would imply that \"a\" equaled \"e\", when we know them to be distinct. Thus we have \"ad\" = \"f\" and \"af\" = \"d\".\n\nFurthermore, since the inverse of \"d\" is \"f\", multiplying \"ad\" = \"f\" on the right by \"f\" gives \"a\" = \"f\". Multiplying this on the left by \"d\" gives us \"da\" = \"f\". Multiplying this on the right by \"a\", we have \"d\" = \"fa\".\n\nFilling in all of these products, the Cayley table now looks like this:\n\nBecause each row must have every element of the group represented exactly once, it is easy to see that the two blank spots in the \"b\" row must be occupied by \"d\" or \"f\". However, if one examines the columns containing these two blank spotsthe \"d\" and \"f\" columnsone finds that \"d\" and \"f\" have already been filled in on both, which means that regardless of how \"d\" and \"f\" are placed in row \"b\", they will always violate the permutation rule. Because our algebraic deductions up until this point were sound, we can only conclude that our earlier, baseless assumption that \"ab\" = \"c\" was, in fact, false. Essentially, we guessed and we guessed incorrectly. We, have, however, learned something: \"ab\" ≠ \"c\".\n\nThe only two remaining possibilities then are that \"ab\" = \"d\" or that \"ab\" = \"f\"; we would expect these two guesses to each have the same outcome, up to isomorphism, because \"d\" and \"f\" are inverses of each other and the letters that represent them are inherently arbitrary anyway. So without loss of generality, take \"ab\" = \"d\". If we arrive at another contradiction, we must assume that no group of order 6 has the identity skeleton we started with, as we will have exhausted all possibilities.\n\nHere is the new Cayley table:\nMultiplying \"ab\" = \"d\" on the left by \"a\", we have \"b\" = \"ad\". Right multiplication by \"f\" gives \"bf\" = \"a\", and left multiplication by \"b\" gives \"f\" = \"ba\". Multiplying on the right by \"a\" we then have \"fa\" = \"b\", and left multiplication by \"d\" then yields \"a\" = \"db\". Filling in the Cayley table, we now have (new additions in red):\n\nSince the \"a\" row is missing \"c\" and \"f\" and since \"af\" cannot equal \"f\" (or \"a\" would be equal to \"e\", when we know them to be distinct), we can conclude that \"af\" = \"c\". Left multiplication by \"a\" then yields \"f\" = \"ac\", which we may multiply on the right by \"c\" to give us \"fc\" = \"a\". Multiplying this on the left by \"d\" gives us \"c\" = \"da\", which we can multiply on the right by \"a\" to obtain \"ca\" = \"d\". Similarly, multiplying \"af\" = \"c\" on the right by \"d\" gives us \"a\" = \"cd\". Updating the table, we have the following, with the most recent changes in blue:\n\nSince the \"b\" row is missing \"c\" and \"d\", and since \"bc\" cannot equal \"c\", it follows that \"bc\" = \"d\", and therefore \"bd\" must equal \"c\". Multiplying on the right by \"f\" this gives us \"b\" = \"cf\", which we can further manipulate into \"cb\" = \"f\" by multiplying by \"c\" on the left. By similar logic we can deduce that \"c\" = \"fb\" and that \"dc\" = \"b\". Filling these in, we have (with the latest additions in green):\n\nSince the \"d\" row is missing only \"f\", we know \"d\" = \"f\", and thus \"f\" = \"d\". As we have managed to fill in the whole table without obtaining a contradiction, we have found a group of order 6: inspection reveals it to be non-abelian. This group is in fact the smallest non-abelian group, the dihedral group \"D\":\n\nThe standard form of a Cayley table has the order of the elements in the rows the same as the order in the columns. Another form is to arrange the elements of the columns so that the \"n\"th column corresponds to the inverse of the element in the \"n\"th row. In our example of \"D\", we need only switch the last two columns, since \"f\" and \"d\" are the only elements that are not their own inverses, but instead inverses of each other.\n\nThis particular example lets us create six permutation matrices (all elements 1 or 0, exactly one 1 in each row and column). The 6x6 matrix representing an element will have a 1 in every position that has the letter of the element in the Cayley table and a zero in every other position, the Kronecker delta function for that symbol. (Note that \"e\" is in every position down the main diagonal, which gives us the identity matrix for 6x6 matrices in this case, as we would expect.) Here is the matrix that represents our element \"a\", for example.\n\nThis shows us directly that any group of order \"n\" is a subgroup of the permutation group \"S\", order \"n\"!.\n\nThe above properties depend on some axioms valid for groups. It is natural to consider Cayley tables for other algebraic structures, such as for semigroups, quasigroups, and magmas, but some of the properties above do not hold.\n\n\n"}

Roosevelt had campaigned for the Presidency, in part, on a pledge to balance the federal budget. On March 10, 1933, six days after his inauguration, Roosevelt submitted legislation to Congress which would cut $500 million ($8.181 billion in 2009 dollars) from the $3.6 billion federal budget by eliminating government agencies, reducing the pay of civilian and military federal workers (including members of Congress), and slashing veterans' benefits by 50 percent. Veterans benefits constituted a quarter of the federal budget at the time. The Act was written primarily by Lewis Douglas, Roosevelt's Director of the Budget, and Grenville Clark, a private attorney.\n\nThe Act faced stiff opposition in the Congress. On June 17, 1932, the Bonus Army (about 17,000 World War I veterans and 26,000 of their family members and affiliated groups) had established a Hooverville shanty town on the Anacostia Flats area of Washington, D.C. On July 28, the U.S. 12th Infantry Regiment commanded by General Douglas MacArthur and the 3rd Cavalry Regiment (supported by six tanks) commanded by Major George S. Patton attacked and set afire the Bonus Army's encampment, injuring hundreds and killing several veterans and civilians.\n\nCongress was forced to flee the city for several days after outraged veterans ringed the United States Capitol. The political backlash caused by the attack on the Bonus Army led to the defeat of several members of Congress that fall. Many in Congress, remembering the incident, did not want to support the Economy Act. The House Democratic Caucus even refused to support the bill. Heavily opposed by liberal Democrats (92 of whom voted against it), the bill passed the House of Representatives only with heavy support of Republicans and conservative Democrats.\n\nThe bill easily passed the Senate only because the Senate Democratic Caucus had scheduled a vote on the popular Cullen-Harrison Act (to amend the Volstead Act to allow the manufacture and sale of beer and light wines) immediately after the vote on the Economy Act—allowing Senators to cast vote for one very unpopular bill and one very popular bill in quick succession.\n\nThe President signed the Economy Act into law on March 20, 1933.\n\nThe Economy Act cut federal spending by $243 million, not the $500 million requested by the President. This aspect of the Act proved deflationary as the government purchased fewer goods and services, and some argue that this led to a worsening of the Great Depression. The act also halved Supreme Court pensions and two of the four anti-New Deal Supreme Court justices, Willis Van Devanter and George Sutherland, refused to retire, remained on the bench, and struck down some of Roosevelt's recovery acts; Supreme Court pensions were originally halved in 1932 but had been temporarily restored by Congress to full pay in February 1933. These two justices would likely have retired from the Supreme Court early into Roosevelt's first term if their pensions had not been halved.\n\nThe Economy Act also gave the President limited authority to reorganize executive branch agencies to achieve efficiency, but this power was not utilized much before the Act expired in 1935. By March 3, 1935, Roosevelt had issued 27 reorganization orders, most of them minor in nature. Roosevelt did not engage in extensive reorganization efforts until the passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939 gave him that authority.\n\nIts most important provisions, however, repealed all federal laws regarding veterans' benefits.\n\nSection 17 of the Act declared: \"All public laws granting medical or hospital treatment, domiciliary care, compensation, and other allowances, pension, disability allowance, or retirement pay to veterans and the dependents of veterans of ... the World War ... are hereby repealed, and all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance are hereby repealed.\" However, the Act allowed the president to re-establish these benefits for two years via executive order at levels the President deemed appropriate.\n\nBenefits for non-disabled veterans fell more than 40%, creating deep resentment among former soldiers and officers and leading to the establishment of the Veterans of Foreign Wars as a major force in American politics. The Economy Act caused a second Bonus Army to form, but Roosevelt handled this protest much more carefully than Hoover had: His administration set up an encampment for the protesters (albeit too far from the Capitol to make their protest effective), prohibited loitering in the District of Columbia (forcing the marchers to stay outside the city), sent Eleanor Roosevelt to deliver food and medicine to the marchers and hear their grievances, and encouraged the ex-servicemen to seek work with the Civilian Conservation Corps (which many did).\n\nVeterans nonetheless sued to have their benefits restored. In \"Lynch v. United States,\" 292 U.S. 571 (1934) and \"United States v. Jackson,\" 302 U.S. 628 (1938), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Congress had violated federal law in eliminating certain insurance guarantees formerly offered to veterans by the War Risk Insurance Act (as amended December 24, 1919; Chapter 16, Section 12, 41 Stat. 371), and those benefits were restored.\n\nThe Economy Act had little effect on either the federal deficit or the economy. Spending in other areas rose so substantially that it dwarfed the cuts imposed by the Economy Act. The benefit cuts also did not last. In June 1933, Roosevelt restored $50 million in pension payments, and Congress added another $46 million. In January 1934, Roosevelt added another $21 million for veterans whose disabilities were service-connected but not service-caused. In March 1934, Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto and added another $90 million in veterans benefits and $120 million to federal workers' salaries. In October 1934, Roosevelt restored $60 million in federal salary cuts, and restored cuts to veterans who had served in the Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War, and Boxer Rebellion.\n"}

It was the original western terminus and is now the Eastside MAX line's first stop eastbound/last stop westbound in downtown.\n\nThe Library/Southwest 9th Avenue stop is located on Yamhill Street and is used by eastbound trains, while the Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue is on Morrison Street and is used by westbound trains. Both platforms are built into the street's sidewalk, and a parking garage with ground-floor retail sits between them.\n\nFor a little more than five years, this station was also served by the Yellow Line, from that line's opening in May 2004 until its relocation to the Portland Transit Mall in August 2009.\n\nThe three 11th Avenue loop tracks, located one block west of these two stations, allow westbound trains terminating in downtown Portland access to Yamhill Street from Morrison Street. Previous to the opening of the Westside section of what is now the Blue Line, all trains used this facility to turn around. Red Line trains used them from that line's opening in 2001 until it was extended to Beaverton Transit Center in 2003. Then, Portland Vintage Trolley still used it on Sundays, and starting in 2004 Yellow Line trains used the loops every day until the Yellow Line and Vintage Trolley both moved to the Portland Transit Mall. Presently, there is no regularly scheduled use of the turnaround loop here, but it is often used to store trains temporarily for use after events, such as a game at nearby Providence Park.\n\nWhen TriMet began using colors to designate rail lines (2001), this was considered the western terminus for what is now the Blue Line, until it was expanded westward to Hillsboro in 1998; this was also the case for the Red Line when it opened in 2001 until it was extended west to Beaverton Transit Center in 2003. It was then used as the western terminus for the Yellow Line until it moved to the Portland Transit Mall in 2009.\n\nDue to safety concerns, passengers are not allowed on trains passing through the loop and must disembark at the Galleria platform. The yard takes up about half a Portland city block, and includes a small maintenance pit and an operator break room. It is also used to store trains for special events. This is similar to the Vintage Trolley junction at Lloyd Center/NE 11th Ave MAX Station, which is now used to store extra light rail cars for events at Rose Quarter Transit Center since the Vintage Trolley is no longer in service.\n\nThe Multnomah County Central Library is on the corner opposite the Library/9th platform. The westbound station's namesake, The Galleria, a former shopping center, now hosts the Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts. It is located across Morrison Street from the Galleria/10th platform. This section of Portland is known as the \"West End\", containing the Portland Park Blocks, museums, and historic hotels.\n\nThe Portland Streetcar system stops close to this MAX station, on 10th Avenue and 11th Avenue. The stops on 10th Avenue allow transfers to streetcars northbound on the NS Line to the Pearl District and Northwest Portland, and on the A Loop to the Pearl District, the Lloyd District, the Oregon Convention Center, and other points on the city's east side. The stops on 11th Avenue allow transfers to streetcars southbound on the NS Line to Portland State University and South Waterfront, and on the B Loop to South Waterfront, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry and the east side. Northbound stops, on 10th Avenue, are at Central Library (across Yamhill Street from the MAX platform) and at Alder (one block north of the MAX platform on Morrison). Southbound stops, on 11th Avenue, are at Alder and Taylor Streets (the latter behind the Central Library).\n\nMAX trains passing through the light rail/Portland Streetcar junction have priority over streetcar traffic, though both generally move with the traffic flow. In addition, there is also a switch to bring streetcars onto the MAX line. On a rainy day, one can see sparks when either type of train pantograph hits the electrical wire junction.\n\n"}

Although many scholars in the field are trained primarily as either historians or as philosophers, there are degree-granting departments of HPS at several prominent universities (see below).\n\nThe organization &HPS (Integrated History and Philosophy of Science) has set forth a program for a unified discipline: \"Good history and philosophy of science is not just history of science into which some philosophy of science may enter, or philosophy of science into which some history of science may enter. It is work that is both historical and philosophical at the same time. The founding insight of the modern discipline of HPS is that history and philosophy have a special affinity and one can effectively advance both simultaneously\".\n\nOne origin of the unified discipline is the historical approach to the discipline of the philosophy of science. This hybrid approach is reflected in the career of Thomas Kuhn. His first permanent appointment, at the University of California, Berkeley, was to a position advertised by the philosophy department, but he also taught courses from the history department. When he was promoted to full professor in the history department only, Kuhn was offended at the philosophers' rejection because \"I sure as hell wanted to be there, and it was my philosophy students who were working with me, not on philosophy but on history, were nevertheless my more important students\". This attitude is also reflected in his historicist approach, as outlined in Kuhn's seminal Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962, 2nd ed. 1970), wherein philosophical questions about scientific theories and, especially, theory change are understood in historical terms, employing concepts such as paradigm shift.\n\nHowever, Kuhn was also critical of attempts fully to unify the \"methods\" of history and philosophy of science: \"Subversion is not, I think, too strong a term for the likely result of an attempt to make the two fields into one. They differ in a number of their central constitutive characteristics, of which the most general and apparent is their goals. The final product of most historical research is a narrative, a story, about particulars of the past. [...] The philosopher, on the other hand, aims principally at explicit generalizations and at those with universal scope. He is no teller of stories, true or false. His goal is to discover and state what is true at all times and places rather than to impart understanding of what occurred at a particular time and place.\" More recent work questions whether these methodological and conceptual divisions are in fact barriers to a unified discipline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, Butters only wins a round of putt-putt golf. The freaks who make a career of appearing on TV talk shows go on strike, and make Butters strike with them.\n\nThe boys are watching an episode of \"Maury\" on which several children with bodily defects are shown. A girl born with no midsection wins a gift certificate, so Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Butters decide to try to get on the show with a faked deformity to win a prize. The group decide that Butters should be the one to go on the show with a scrotum on his chin. Butters then agrees, and the town's two sci-fi geeks make fake balls to put on Butters.\n\nButters then flies alone to New York to appear on the show. In the green room, he meets other variously deformed people, who welcome Butters to their union, which ensures that US TV talk shows interview their members regularly.\n\nOn the show, Maury introduces Butters as \"Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park.\" Butters wins a trip to the largest miniature golf course in the world. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are watching the show at home and become angry that Butters got \"their\" prize. Cartman calls \"Maury\" and tries to get himself on the show. The operator tells him they aren't currently interviewing people with deformities, but are trying to find \"out of control kids\" for a future episode. Cartman convinces his mom to take him on that show and lie that he's out of control.\n\nButters is grounded by his parents for putting fake deformity on the Maury show. The freaks strike in protest of \"Maury\"'s decision to stop interviewing people with deformities, and head to Butters' house to recruit him. Fear of being discovered as a faker leads him to reluctantly agree, and he goes on strike with the group.\n\nCartman and his mom go on \"Maury\". Seeing a teenage girl's \"out of control\" behaviour, Cartman dresses up as a slutty girl to try to win the prize. The deformed people's union hijacks the TV studio's video screen and broadcasts a plea to the audience. They state that they are the \"true\" freaks and they should not lose their means of employment to people who are only freaks because they are \"stupid trailer trash from the South\". The union members present a music video about looking for the \"True Freak Label\" on talk shows, and most of the audience agrees and leave the studio. Maury agrees to negotiate with the deformed people. Cartman is irate that Butters once again ruined his chance to win a prize. He rips the fake balls off of Butters' chin. Butters fears he will be found out, but the union chases Cartman, who believe he was physically harming Butters. Butters' parents arrive in a taxi, and he knows he is in trouble again.\n\nThe \"True Freak Label\" video sabotage that the freaks make Butters star in is a shot-by-shot parody of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union commercial from the 70s, which showed the workers singing a song known as \"Look for the Union Label.\" According to the episode commentary, Parker and Stone were reminded of the commercial when viewing a bootlegged version of the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\", which retained the commercial.\n\n\"Freak Strike\", along with the sixteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Sixth Season\", were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005.

Cornish chickens, as well as crosses of Cornishes, are the most-used breed in the chicken meat industry. They are heavy, muscular birds that lay brown eggs.\n\nThe Cornish is known variously as \"Indian Game\" or \"Cornish Game\" depending on country. In America it was always known as \"Indian Game\" until 1905 when the American Poultry Association passed a motion to rename it \"Cornish Indian Game\". Due to confusion caused by implying the breed came from India, and unpopularity of \"Game\" in the name, it was renamed to simply the \"Cornish\" in 1910.\n\nIn Australia they are still known solely as \"Indian Game\". Usage of the two varies in the United Kingdom, but it is officially the \"Indian Game\" according to the Poultry Club of Great Britain.\n\nThe breed was developed by Sir Walter Gilbert, 1st Baronet around 1820. It was accepted by the American Poultry Association in 1893.\n\nIt is a large, stocky breed, and is often crossed with other breeds to enhance meat production. There are two variates, the Cornish Game and the Jubilee Cornish Game. The Cornish Game is dark blue-green with brown patterning on the hens in there are also double laced of the above colors and a double laced blue in the UK and Europe. Jubilee Cornish Game tend to be lighter and less stocky than their counterparts. They are usually light wheaten in color, with light brown patterning.\n\nIt is quite a popular show bird. It has a tendency for bad legs due to widely spaced hips, although its domestic counterparts do not tend to have this issue and have a more standard posture and gait. It has a large breast and makes an excellent meat bird. It is also when crossed with a Sussex, Dorking or similar utility type breeds. On average Indian Game produce 160–180 eggs per annum, less than some more prolific breeders. However, they are relatively easy to handle and make good mothers. Indian Game require more space than most other breeds so they may not be suitable for suburban producers or enthusiasts. The Indian Game is highly prone to parasites. The Cornish must also be provided with extra shelter as their feathers tend to be thinner than other birds.\n\n\n\n"}

Besigye alleged fraud and rejected the result.\n\nIn the general election of 23 February 2006, the party won 37 out of 289 elected seats. In the presidential election on the same date, Besigye won 37.4 per cent of the vote. In the 2011 election, the party performed worse with Besigye getting 26.01 per cent of the vote and the party winning 34 seats.\n\nThe origins of the FDC are intertwined with the history of the ruling NRM led by President Museveni. The NRM through its military wing the National Resistance Army (NRA) fought a successful guerrilla war against the governments of Milton Obote and Tito Okello and came to power in Uganda in 1986. During the guerrilla war, Museveni successfully moulded various interest groups into an effective military machine, and on achieving power, he began to build the NRM into a cohesive political organisation. The transition process and the NRM's desire to broaden its political base revealed other interests within the party and a feeling amongst some senior members of being sidelined.\n\nMuseveni had relied heavily on the support of the Tutsi refugees and their descendants who had been forced out of Rwanda by the Hutu majority in the 1960s. During the guerrilla war, the NRA had moved from the central district of Luwero to the west of the country where most of the Tutsis had been recruited. On achieving power, Tutsis like Paul Kagame and Fred Gisa Rwigyema were rewarded with powerful positions within the army and government.\n\nThe NRA advance on Kampala was very rapid, and during this process, hundreds of new recruits were incorporated into the NRA. Many of these came from Museveni's own tribe, the Banyankole, and other western tribes like the Batoro. When the NRA advanced back into Buganda through the town of Masaka, their ranks were expanded by Baganda, many who travelled from different parts of Buganda to join the guerrillas. For many of these, the common goal was simply to oust the northern-dominated government. There were also those who saw the opportunity to use the NRA to achieve Buganda's ambitions of autonomy.\n\nAnother important development was the NRA recruitment of younger impressionable soldiers who often held Museveni in awe. This did not often go down well with the more senior NRA officers:\n\nThe younger educated cadres began to gain more influence in the NRM. Many had only joined the war towards its conclusion or had joined as NRM cadres after the war. This rivalry was often vocal and acrimonious:\n\nThe young cadres and the Tutsi refugees formed the new power base of the NRM, and the party increasingly appeared tribal. Ugandan politics has been plagued by tribalism, and the young cadres with their new influence often encouraged the appointment of their relatives into key government positions. Most of these cadres were from the south-west of Uganda like Museveni.\n\nThis power base was suddenly weakened when the Tutsi refugees led by Fred Rwigema decided to return to Rwanda to fight the government (Habyarimana). The loss of so many key military and political advisers particularly in the intelligence services left Museveni vulnerable. The NRM realised it had to broaden its appeal, first by appeasing the Baganda (Uganda's largest ethnic group) by restoring their king the Kabaka, and recruiting more people from other tribes into the armed forces. The NRM also emphasised its role in restoring law and order to the country and continuously evoked the fear amongst the southern tribes that the brutal northern armies of Obote and Idi Amin could return if the NRM failed. This fear was facilitated by the war in the north waged by the Lords Resistance Army. The NRM also presided over rapid economic growth in the south of Uganda.\n\nWith this new confidence, Museveni began to act against those challenging his authority in the NRM. Many of these were the original members of the NRM/NRA, including the army commander Major General Mugisha Muntu and other once powerful NRM leaders. Many of these leaders opted for quiet retirement in their home districts, but others, like Mugisha Muntu and the former NRM spokesperson Winnie Byanyima, began openly criticising Museveni. There appeared, however, to have been little enthusiasm to completely break with the NRM, rather to encourage change from within.\n\nThis changed in the elections in 2001 when retired NRA officer Besigye challenged Museveni for the presidency. Besigye was relatively unknown outside the NRM/NRA establishment, but his courage in standing for election attracted support.\n\nThe FDC was formally established in 2004. Besigye had gone into exile in the United States and then South Africa. The genesis of the party, however, was in Uganda where many disgruntled NRM members were actively promoting the establishment of a political organisation to challenge Museveni. This desire was further cemented when Museveni amended the constitution to allow him to stand for a third presidential term. This had angered many NRM veterans who had remained in the NRM waiting to take over when Museveni stood down. The amendment was criticised by some of Museveni's closest allies, like Eriya Kategaya who at the time was seen by many as the number two in the NRM/NRA political hierarchy. This opposition, however, did not bother Museveni who had by now firmly established himself in the NRM.\n\nThe FDC benefited from this disquiet, and when Besigye returned to Uganda, he found the FDC had considerable support even within the ranks of the NRM. This factor prompted Museveni to arrest Besigye. Although it was doubtful that Besigye could win an election against Museveni, the fact that he was attracting support from the NRA (now renamed the Uganda People's Defence Force) members brought the spectre of a split in the army. The FDC had many ex-NRA commanders in its ranks, including the former army commander Mugisha Muntu. Another factor was that many of these politicians were from the same region of Uganda as Museveni and, therefore, they could attract support from the president's own backyard.\n\nBesigye's arrest was a political blunder that served to increase the popularity of the FDC. But the party now began to suffer from its success. Many of the prominent ex-NRM members were reluctant to publicly criticise Museveni. Politicians like Eriya Kategaya, who was now in the FDC leadership, were tentative in their approach. A further hindrance was that the government placed enormous restrictions on Besigye's ability to mount a national campaign. The FDC was extremely popular in urban areas like the capital city, Kampala, but with limited campaign time, he could not effectively campaign in rural areas where 70 percent of the population live. The NRM, on the other hand, spent enormous energy campaigning in rural areas and small towns.\n\nThe FDC and Besigye were also popular in the north where the population has suffered almost two decades of war between the government and the Lord's Resistance Army. This was despite the fact that the FDC hardly campaigned in this area. This is a reflection of the grievances felt by northern Ugandans who often felt abandoned by the government in Kampala.\n\nDespite these obstacles, the FDC won over 30 percent of the vote, a major achievement for a party that was hardly a year old. The party eclipsed the traditional opposition parties like the Uganda People's Congress and the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2011, the FDC once again led the opposition to Museveni and the NRM in the presidential and parliamentary elections. The party once again failed to overturn Museveni's popularity. The FDC did worse than in 2006. Since the 2011 election, the party has been central in organising street demonstrations - some which have resulted in violent confrontations with the police.\n\nAfter the 2016 general election, the FDC flag bearer, Dr. Kizza Besigye, contested Electoral Commission results. This was after he was under house arrest for three months he went ahead to swear himself in as the Ugandan People's President in a secret location. He went ahead to create what came to be known as a People's Government with a full cabinet and district leaders. Kampala Lord Mayor Elias Lukwago was appointed Vice President, and a big number of opposition politicians were appointed and currently serve in the People's Government.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1802820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802820", "title": "Eastern tent caterpillar", "text": "Eastern tent caterpillar\n\nThe eastern tent caterpillar (\"Malacosoma americanum\") is a species of moth in the family Lasiocampidae, the tent caterpillars or lappet moths. It is univoltine, producing one generation per year. It is a tent caterpillar, a social species that forms communal nests in the branches of trees. It is sometimes confused with the gypsy moth and the fall webworm, and may be erroneously referred to as a bagworm, which is the common name applied to unrelated caterpillars in the family Psychidae. The moths oviposit almost exclusively on trees in the plant family Rosaceae, particularly cherry (\"Prunus\") and apple (\"Malus\"). The caterpillars are hairy with areas of blue, white, black and orange. The blue and white colors are structural colors created by the selective filtering of light by microtubules that arise on the cuticle.\n\nTent caterpillars are among the most social of larvae. The adult moth lays her eggs in a single batch in late spring or early summer. An egg mass contains about 200 to 300 eggs. Embryogenesis proceeds rapidly, and within three weeks, fully formed caterpillars can be found within the eggs. The small caterpillars lie quiescent until the following spring, when they chew their way out of the eggs just as the buds of the host tree begin to develop.\n\nThe newly hatched caterpillars initiate the construction of a silk tent soon after emerging. They typically aggregate at the tent site throughout their larval stage, expanding the tent each day to accommodate their increasing size. Under field conditions, the caterpillars feed three times each day, just before dawn, at midafternoon, and in the evening after sunset. During each bout of feeding, the caterpillars emerge from the tent, add silk to the structure, move to distant feeding sites \"en masse\", feed, and then return immediately to the tent where they rest until the next activity period. The exception to this feeding pattern occurs in the last instar, when the caterpillars feed only at night. The insect has six larval instars. At the last stage, the caterpillars disperse and each constructs a cocoon in a protected place. The adult moths, or imagoes, emerge about two weeks later. They are strictly nocturnal and start flying after nightfall, coming to rest within a few hours of dawn. Mating and oviposition typically occur on the day the moths emerge from their cocoons; the females die soon thereafter.\n\nTent caterpillars, like many other species of social caterpillars, vigorously thrash the anterior part of their bodies when they detect predators and parasitoids. Such bouts of thrashing, which may be initiated by a single caterpillar, radiate rapidly through the colony and may result in group displays involving dozens of caterpillars. Such displays create a moving target for tachinid flies, wasps, and other small parasitoids that would lay eggs on or in the body of the caterpillar. They also clearly deter stink bugs and other timid predators. Groups of caterpillars resting on the surface of the tent constitute aposematic displays. Few birds other than cuckoos find the hairy caterpillars palatable. Cherry leaves are cyanogenic and the caterpillars regurgitate cyanide-laden juices when disturbed.\n\nThe tent of this species is among the largest built by any tent caterpillar. It is constructed in the crotch of the host tree and is typically oriented with the broadest wall facing the southeast to take advantage of the morning sun. The caterpillars typically add silk to the surface of the structure at the onset of each of their daily activity periods. The silk is laid down under slight tension and it eventually contracts, causing the newly spun layer of silk to separate from the next layer. The tent thus consists of discrete layers separated by gaps within which the caterpillars rest. The tent has openings to allow them to enter and exit. Openings are often formed where branches jut from the structure, but are most common at the apex of the tent.\n\nLight has a great effect on the caterpillars while they are spinning, and they spin the majority of their silk on the most illuminated face of the tent. Indeed, if, under experimental conditions, the dominant light source is directed at the tent from below, the caterpillars will build their tent upside down.\n\nCaterpillars continue to expand their tent until they enter the last phase of their larval lives. The sixth-instar caterpillar conserves its silk for cocoon construction and adds nothing to the tent.\n\nThe tents are multifunctional. They facilitate basking, offer some protection from enemies, provide secure perches, and act as a staging site from which the caterpillars launch \"en masse\" forays to distant feeding sites. The elevated humidity inside the tent may facilitate molting.\n\nEastern tent caterpillars are among the earliest of caterpillars to appear in the spring. Because the early spring weather is often cold, the caterpillars rely on the heat of the sun to elevate their body temperatures to levels that allow them to digest their food. Studies show that below 15 °C (59 °F), the caterpillars are unable to process the food in their guts. Early instars are black and their bodies readily absorb heat. When basking, they typically pack together tightly, reducing heat loss due to convective currents. Their long setae also serve to stem convective heat loss. The caterpillars may aggregate on the surface of the tent or within it. The tents act as miniature greenhouses, trapping the heat of the morning sun and allowing the caterpillars to warm more quickly than they would if they remained outside. An aggregation of basking caterpillars can achieve temperatures in excess (T−T) of 44 °C. They easily overheat, so the aggregation splits up when they reach a satisfactory temperature.\n\nBecause of its layered structure, the tent is thermally heterogeneous, and the caterpillars can adjust their temperature by moving from layer to layer. They may also aggregate on the outside of the shaded side of the tent and hang from the tips of their abdomens to enhance convective heat loss and cooling.\n\nAs has been shown for some other caterpillars, eastern tent caterpillars are capable of generating a small amount of metabolic heat while they digest their meals. When recently fed caterpillars pack tightly together, the temperature in the interior of the mass may be several degrees above ambient temperature even in the absence of a radiant heat source. It is unclear whether this small heat gain has a significant effect on the rate of their growth.\n\nTent caterpillars secrete silk from a spinneret wherever they go, and frequently-used pathways soon bear conspicuous silk trails. As the caterpillars move about the tree, they largely confine their movements to these trails. They lay down pheromones along the trails by dragging their abdomens. Caterpillars that find food may overmark the exploratory trails they follow back to the tent, creating recruitment trails. Recruitment trails are much more attractive to its brethren than exploratory trails, and serve to lead the group directly to the newest food source. A single successful forager can recruit the entire colony to its food find.\n\nThe exact identity of the trail pheromone of the eastern tent caterpillar has not yet been determined, but the chemical 5β-cholestane-3-one has been shown to be fully competitive with it. Caterpillars readily follow trails of this chemical, even abandoning their own trails in favor of artificial trails prepared with the compound.\n\nThe eastern tent caterpillar is of some importance as a pest because it defoliates ornamental trees. Damaged trees, however, typically recover and refoliate within several weeks.\n\nThe eastern tent caterpillar is toxic to horses. It has been linked to mare reproductive loss syndrome in horses, but the exact mechanism by which the caterpillar triggers abortion has yet to be determined. Experimental studies have shown that when pregnant mares are fed eastern tent caterpillars, they abort. The caterpillars of this species often feed on the highly cyanogenic black cherry tree (\"Prunus serotina\") and the mares were originally thought to abort in response to the cyanide they consumed along with the caterpillars. However, that hypothesis was disproved. In another study, the necropsy of a mare fed eastern tent caterpillars showed fragments of the caterpillar's setae had embedded in the gut wall, and it was hypothesized that they may facilitate the passage of infective agents from the horse's gut into the bloodstream and then to the placenta, triggering abortion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1802841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802841", "title": "Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant", "text": "Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant\n\nThe Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant is a nuclear power plant located in Monticello, Minnesota, along the Mississippi River. The site, which began operating in 1971, has a single nuclear reactor (boiling water reactor) of the General Electric BWR-3 design generating 671 MWe. The reactor was originally licensed until 2010; a renewal license issued in 2006 allows it to continue operating until September 8, 2030.\n\nThe plant is owned by Xcel Energy and operated by Northern States Power, its regional subsidiary.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nAccording to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population was 62,976 within of Monticello, an increase of 36.5 percent in a decade; and 2,977,934 within , an increase of 8.6 percent. Cities within 50 miles include the Twin Cities of Minneapolis (38 miles to city center) and St. Paul (45 miles to city center).\n\nTo the delight of local residents and tourists, the Monticello section of the Mississippi River remains unfrozen during winter and attracts hundreds of trumpeter swans, largely due to warm water discharged by the nuclear plant.\n\nRoughly 1,300 gallons of radioactive water which accidentally leaked from the plant into the Mississippi River in an incident on 5 May 1982, was determined to be \"no threat\" to the public. \n\nIn January 2007 a 13-ton control box fell eight to twelve inches and caused an unexpected shutdown. This control box was located in the condenser room of the turbine building and contained valves which controlled steam pressure. Emergency response teams at the station deemed that the event was likely caused by inadequate welds at the time of installation and fatigue due to vibrations over the life of the plant.\n\nConstruction of the on-site independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) pad began in June 2007. The target date for the completion of the pads is December 2007 with insertion of the first ten dry storage containers (holding spent fuel assemblies) into horizontal storage modules (HSMs) in mid-2008. Initially, 12 HSMs will be placed on the storage pad. Each HSM—a thick, reinforced, pre-cast concrete structure about the size of a single car garage—has the capacity to hold 61 fuel bundles.\n\nOn September 11, 2008, a cable fault tripped the transformer which supplied power to the site. This resulted in a loss of off-site power and the plant automatically shut down.\n\nOn September 18, 2008, an employee for a rental equipment company was electrocuted by one phase of the 115-kV power line outside of the plant due to a lack of situational awareness. The individual was raising a bucket lift without watching overhead and contacted one phase of the 115-kV line. The plant was offline at the time due to the forced outage described above.\n\nIn February 2011, the site's plant officials determined that four control rod blades could be affected by a potentially substantial safety hazard. Vice President Tim O'Connor indicated that the blades would be replaced in March.\n\nMonticello has struggled with safety culture issues of significant concern, leading to a yellow finding by the NRC based on Monticello being unable to mitigate a maximum probable flood which, if it occurred, would have likely led to core damage and significant risk to the health and safety of the public. The NRC has cleared Monticello of the concerns to flooding.\n\nIn 2006, Xcel Energy proposed a series of upgrades to the plant in order to increase its output and extend its life for an additional 20 years. In December 2013, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the license amendment allowing the unit to increase output from 600 MWe to 671 MWe However, final project implementation costs significantly outstripped initial estimates by more than $400 million. In 2015, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission denied full cost recovery and determined that, while Xcel Energy could include the additional cost in customer rates, it could not earn a return on those costs. Xcel Energy would record a greater than $100 million loss in 1Q 2015 as a result and recouped $27 million less than expected from the project.\n\nIn March 2013, the plant was shut down for a routine refueling. During this time, workers replaced several original plant components. This increased the plant's electrical output from the original 600 MWe to 671 MWe. In early August, the plant was brought back online with the new equipment. Refueling outages as such increase the population of the plant's workforce by the thousands.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Monticello was 1 in 52,632, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.\n\n\nfootnote number 6:\n\nNuclear Regulatory Commission, Preliminary Notification – Region III, Sept. 15, 2008, Preliminary Notification Of Event Or Unusual Occurrence – PNO-III-08-009; <http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0825/ML082590668.pdf>\n\n"}

The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in downtown Portland, and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the Blue Line and the Red Line, respectively. They are situated directly west of the Portland Transit Mall at Pioneer Courthouse Square; these stations, along with the Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations that are served by the Green, Orange, and Yellow lines, mark the only transfer point in the MAX system where riders can board any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project—Portland's first light rail line. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. The Red Line began serving the stations in September 2001, initially connecting downtown to Portland International Airport. In 2003, the Red Line extended westward to Beaverton. The Yellow Line also served the stations from 2004 to 2009, connecting downtown to the Expo Center; TriMet rerouted this line to serve the transit mall in August 2009.\n\nThe Portland city block bound by Southwest Morrison and Yamhill streets to the north and south, and 6th Avenue and Broadway to the east and west had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a two-story parking garage. In 1969, block owner Meier & Frank requested a permit for the construction of an 800-car parking garage, which the Portland City Council rejected after a series of heated public hearings. The controversial proposal led the local business community and the city to pursue a comprehensive downtown plan that envisioned turning the site into a public space instead. After several negotiations with Meier & Frank, the city purchased the property and in 1980, announced a national design competition for a plaza that would be called \"Pioneer Courthouse Square\".\n\nPortland's first light rail line, which planners referred to as the Banfield light rail project, received federal approval for construction in September 1980. Just over a year later, TriMet published a conceptual design report of the project that outlined a 27-station, line, including a pair of light rail stations at Pioneer Courthouse Square. The platforms would be situated along the north and south ends of the square on Southwest Morrison and Yamhill streets. Construction of the line commenced in April 1983 in Gresham and largely progressed from east to west, with the downtown segment among the final sections to be completed. Street and sidewalk reconstruction work finally reached downtown in March the following year. While work continued on the line, the city finished building the square and dedicated it on April 6, 1984. By March 1986, major light rail construction work had ceased. Line testing in downtown began with the arrival of the first light rail car that May. \n\nOn September 5, 1986, TriMet officially opened the light rail line, which it named Metropolitan Area Express (MAX), to the public. A three-day celebration took place across the route, including at Pioneer Courthouse Square, which hosted an opening ceremony and several concerts. More than 3,000 people gathered at the square to welcome the 11:45 am arrival of the first train from Gresham. Between 1986 and 1998, MAX service ran from Cleveland Avenue in central Gresham to 11th Avenue in downtown Portland, serving the Pioneer Square stations.\n\nIn 1998, TriMet extended MAX service farther west to Hatfield Government Center in downtown Hillsboro in Washington County with the opening of the Westside MAX. On September 10, 2001, the Red Line, which connected downtown—and eventually Beaverton—to Portland International Airport became the second line to serve the stations while the original line became the Blue Line. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line, which runs to the Expo Center in North Portland, also stopped at these stations until TriMet rerouted it to the light rail tracks on Portland Transit Mall in August 2009.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations occupy the sidewalks facing Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in downtown Portland. Pioneer Courthouse Square, commonly known as \"Portland's Living Room\", is situated between the stations' platforms. Amenities include garbage cans, shelters, and schedule information displays. TriMet's ticket office is located inside the visitor information center on the west side of the square between the water features. Fares may be purchased at the ticket office or from ticket vending machines on the platforms. Oregon's first Starbucks outlet sits adjacent to the western edge of the westbound platform.\n\nTriMet considers the square a transit hub. It is the only location in the MAX system where all five existing light rail services interconnect. The northbound light rail tracks on the Portland Transit Mall run along the immediate east side of the platforms on 6th Avenue; this provides a direct transfer to the MAX platform of Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th station across the street, which is served by the Green and Yellow lines. On the opposite end of this adjacent block, which is occupied by the Pioneer Courthouse, is the southbound MAX station, Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th. This station is served by the Green and Orange lines. The Pioneer Square stations also facilitate transfers to buses serving the Portland Transit Mall.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are served by the MAX Blue Line, which connects them to Beaverton and Hillsboro to the west and Gresham to the east, and the MAX Red Line, which connects them to Beaverton to the west and Portland International Airport to the east. From the stations, westbound trains take approximately 25minutes to reach Beaverton Transit Center and 50minutes to reach Hatfield Government Center station. Eastbound trains take approximately 35minutes to reach Portland International Airport station and 50minutes to reach Cleveland Avenue station. The stations together recorded an average 5,123 riders on weekdays in fall 2019.\n"}

{"id": "1802881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802881", "title": "Doxorubicin", "text": "Doxorubicin\n\nDoxorubicin, sold under the brand name Adriamycin among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer. This includes breast cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is often used together with other chemotherapy agents. Doxorubicin is given by injection into a vein.\nCommon side effects include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and inflammation of the mouth. Other serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage at the site of injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.\nDoxorubicin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$3.88–32.79 per 50 mg vial. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about £100.12. Versions that are pegylated and in liposomes are also available; however, are more expensive. Doxorubicin was originally made from the bacteria \"Streptomyces peucetius\".\n\nDoxorubicin is commonly used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).\n\nDoxil (see below) is used primarily for the treatment of ovarian cancer where the disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy, or for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\nThere is a pegylated (polyethylene glycol coated) liposome-encapsulated form of doxorubicin, sold as Doxil. It was developed to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer that causes lesions to grow under the skin, in the lining of the mouth, nose and throat, or in other organs. The polyethylene glycol coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin. However, this also results in a side effect called palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome.\n\nFollowing administration of this form of doxorubicin, small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The result of this leakage is redness, tenderness, and peeling of the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful. In clinical testing at 50 mg/m dosing every 4 weeks, half of people developed hand-foot syndrome. The rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby limiting potential substitution. Substitution would be desirable because liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than unencapsulated doxorubicin. This form is also approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.\n\nA non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, called Myocet, is approved in Europe and Canada for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not been approved by the FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.\n\nThe most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550 mg/m, 18% when the dose is 551–600 mg/m and 36% when the dose exceeds 600 mg/m. There are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy, including oxidative stress, downregulation of genes for contractile proteins, and p53-mediated apoptosis.\n\nDoxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy typically results in dilated cardiomyopathy, with all four cardiac chambers being enlarged. This results in both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Eventually, heart failure can result, which carries a 50% mortality rate. There is no effective treatment against established cardiomyopathy caused by the drug as of 2010. The drug dexrazoxane may be used to decrease the risk of doxorubicin's cardiotoxicity in certain cases.\n\nAnother common and potentially fatal complication of doxorubicin is typhlitis, an acute life-threatening infection of the bowel. Additionally, some people may develop PPE, characterized by skin eruptions on the palms of the hand or soles of the feet, swelling, pain, and erythema. Due to these side effects and its red color, doxorubicin has earned the nickname \"red devil\" or \"red death.\"\n\nChemotherapy can cause reactivation of hepatitis B, and doxorubicin-containing regimens are no exception.\n\nDoxorubicin and several chemotherapeutic drugs (including cyclophosphamide) cause dyspigmentation. Other groups of drugs that cause this problem include antimalarials, amiodarone, heavy metals (but not iron), tetracyclines, and antipsychotics.\n\nDoxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-hydroxylated version of daunorubicin, the immediate precursor of DXR in its biosynthetic pathway. \n\nDaunorubicin is more abundantly found as a natural product because it is produced by a number of different wild type strains of \"Streptomyces\". In contrast, only one known non-wild type species, \"Streptomyces peucetius\" subspecies \"cesius\" ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin. This strain was created by Arcamone et al. in 1969 by mutating a strain producing daunorubicin, but not DXR, at least in detectable quantities. Subsequently, Hutchinson's group showed that under special environmental conditions, or by the introduction of genetic modifications, other strains of \"Streptomyces\" can produce doxorubicin. His group also cloned many of the genes required for DXR production, although not all of them have been fully characterized. In 1996, Strohl's group discovered, isolated and characterized dox A, the gene encoding the enzyme that converts daunorubicin into DXR. \n\nBy 1999, they produced recombinant dox A, a cytochrome P450 oxidase, and found that it catalyzes multiple steps in DXR biosynthesis, including steps leading to daunorubicin. This was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicin-producing strains have the necessary genes to produce DXR, the much more therapeutically important of the two. Hutchinson's group went on to develop methods to improve the yield of DXR, from the fermentation process used in its commercial production, not only by introducing dox A encoding plasmids, but also by introducing mutations to deactivate enzymes that shunt DXR precursors to less useful products, for example baumycin-like glycosides. Some triple mutants, that also over-expressed dox A, were able to double the yield of DXR. This is of more than academic interest, because at that time DXR cost about $1.37 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225 kg per annum.\n\nMore efficient production techniques have brought the price down to $1.1 million per kg for the nonliposomal formulation. Although DXR can be produced semi-synthetically from daunorubicin, the process involves electrophilic bromination and multiple steps, and the yield is poor. Since daunorubicin is produced by fermentation, it would be ideal if the bacteria could complete DXR synthesis more effectively.\n\nDoxorubicin interacts with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits the progression of topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.\n\nThe planar aromatic chromophore portion of the molecule intercalates between two base pairs of the DNA, while the six-membered daunosamine sugar sits in the minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the intercalation site, as evidenced by several crystal structures.\n\nBy intercalation, doxorubicin can also induce histone eviction from transcriptionally active chromatin. As a result, DNA damage response, epigenome and transcriptome are deregulated in doxorubicin-exposed cells.\n\nIn the 1950s, an Italian research company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to find anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle. A new strain of \"Streptomyces peucetius\", which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name \"Dauni\", a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, \"rubis\", describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug was successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could lead to fatal cardiac toxicity.\n\nResearchers at Farmitalia soon discovered that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes in the structure of the compound. A strain of \"Streptomyces\" was mutated using \"N\"-nitroso-\"N\"-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention. Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained.\n\nDoxorubicin and daunorubicin together can be thought of as prototype compounds for the anthracyclines. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin. By 1991, 553 of them had been evaluated in the screening program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2016 GPX-150 was granted orphan drug designation by US FDA.\n\nIt is also known as hydroxydaunorubicin and hydroxydaunomycin.\n\nIt is sold under a number of different brand names, including Adriamycin PFS, Adriamycin RDF, or Rubex.\n\nDoxorubicin is photosensitive, and containers are often covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it. Doxorubicin is also available in liposome-encapsulated forms as Doxil (pegylated form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, although these forms must also be given by intravenous injection.\n\nBetween 2011 and March 2014, Doxil was in limited supply. In 2011, Doxil became available only in very limited supply due to production problems with the third-party manufacturer. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), through its subsidiary Janssen Products, LP, had been receiving its Doxil supply from contract manufacturer Ben Venue Laboratories (located in Bedford, Ohio), a unit of \"Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH\" of Germany. The problems began when Ben Venue temporarily shut down their manufacturing facility due to quality control issues.\n\nIn February 2012, to address the Doxil shortage, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed for the temporary importation of Lipodox, which contains the same active ingredient as Doxil and is made by Sun Pharma Global FZE (Sun), a subsidiary of India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. The agency said it intends to continue allowing the importation of Lipodox until Sun has made enough generic Doxil to meet demand.\n\nThe FDA approved the first generic version of Doxil, made by Sun, in February 2013. It will be available in 20 milligram and 50 milligram vials.\n\nCombination therapy experiments with sirolimus (rapamycin) and doxorubicin have shown promise in treating Akt-positive lymphomas in mice.\n\nRecent animal research coupling a murine monoclonal antibody with doxorubicin has created an immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice. Current treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) still leaves pockets of HIV within the host. The immunoconjugate could potentially provide a complementary treatment to ART to eradicate antigen-expressing T cells.\n\nThere is some evidence for antimalarial activity for doxorubicin and similar compounds. In 2009, a compound similar in structure to doxorubicin was found to inhibit plasmepsin II, an enzyme unique to the malarial parasite \"Plasmodium falciparum\". The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) later identified doxorubicin in a set of compounds that inhibit parasite growth \n\nDoxorubicin is also known to be fluorescent. This has often been used to characterize doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened the possibility of using the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It is also known to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.\n\n"}

It was an attempt by the Dano-Norwegians to recapture Anholt, a small Danish island off the coast of Jutland which the British had captured in 1809. Early in the Gunboat War, the Dano-Norwegians had closed their lighthouse at the easternmost point of Anholt. In January 1809, the bomb-vessel \"Proselyte\", which the British had stationed off Anholt to act as a lighthouse, struck Anholt Reef and sank. On 18 May 1809, the 74-gun Third Rate HMS \"Standard\", under Captain Askew Hollis, led in a squadron that also included the frigate \"Owen Glendower\", and the vessels \"Avenger\", \"Ranger\", \"Rose\", and \"Snipe\". Together they captured the island. \n\nA landing party of seamen and marines under the command of Captain William Selby of \"Owen Glendower\", with the assistance of Captain Edward Nicolls of the \"Standard\"s marines, landed. The Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp but ineffectual resistance that killed one British marine and wounded two; the garrison then surrendered. The British took immediate possession of the island. The Danish army had a larger fighting force than the British, but a lack of planning and supply failures led to a devastating defeat and many Danish casualties. As a result of the battle, the Royal Marines won many supporters among senior naval officers, which helped to further their cause for fairness in terms of service and officers' promotion. After the battle, the British occupation of Anholt continued until peace was signed at the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. There is a monument commemorating the battle in the village on the island.\n\nHollis, in his report, stated that Anholt was important in that it could furnish supplies of water to His Majesty's fleet, and afford a good anchorage to merchant vessels sailing to and from the Baltic. However, the principal objective of the mission was to restore the lighthouse on the island to its pre-war state to facilitate the movement of British men of war and merchantmen navigating the dangerous seas there. King Frederick VI of Denmark declared the recovery of Anholt to be the highest priority and gave orders in February 1810 for the collection of the necessary troops and gunboats, under the overall command of General Tellequist. Winter ice and late storms hampered the expedition which set sail three times from Gjerrild Bay, just north of Grenå, without reaching Anholt. Eventually, when British warships started to be seen, the window of opportunity had disappeared and General Tellequist gave the order to abandon the expedition for that year.\n\nCaptain Nicolls, of the Royal Marines, the British governor on the island, had heard of the plans to recapture Anholt and deployed a gunboat, the , to scout the coast of Jutland whenever the weather was fair. \"Grinder\" also captured some small merchant vessels, but on 13 April 1810 four Danish gunboats captured her. In August 1810 Anholt became a stone frigate, and was notionally classified as a 50-gun ship. Although the island garrison consisted of Royal Marines, it was a ship in the eyes of the Admiralty, and the officer commanding the Marines, Captain Torrens of the Royal Marines, was ultimately accountable to Captain Maurice of the Royal Navy, the British governor on the island. This arrangement reflected the inequality of status between Royal Navy officers, and Royal Marine counterparts.\n\nAt the beginning of March 1811, Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez received information that the Danes would attack Anholt. \"Tartar\" sailed from Yarmouth on 20 March and anchored off the north end of the island on 26 March. On 24 March, a Danish fleet of 18 gunboats with 1000 Danish marines on board left Gjerrild beach in Jutland. The Danish fleet was unaware that frigates were on the way to protect the British base on Anholt, known as Fort York, and had been reinforced with artillery. The Danes landed some 1000 troops in the darkness and fog and attempted to outflank the British positions. The Danes landed on the northern beach of Anholt early in the morning and marched towards Fort York, a bastion built in extension of the lighthouse and now manned by 380 British marines. On 27 March, the garrison sighted the enemy off the south side of the island. Maurice marched to meet them with a battery of howitzers and 200 infantry, and signaled \"Tartar\" and \"Sheldrake\". The two vessels immediately made every endeavour to beat south, but the shoals forced them to stand so far out that it took them many hours. There was a failure to co-ordinate any Danish plan of battle and the fighting ended in sporadic encounters. The Danish soldiers, without supplies, became thirsty and tired. The batteries at Fort Yorke (the British base) and Massareenes stopped the assault. The Danes launched a final attack on Fort York at 10 in the evening, led by a Major Melsted. With raised sword, he led a charge by a small party of men towards the fort, but a British bullet ended his life and settled the battle. The Danish attempts to take Fort York failed due to a combination of poor planning, a lack of provisions and a failure to bring field artillery - much of this due to the current limitations on Danish shipping following British naval successes. Ultimately, this proved fatal.\n\nGunfire from \"Tartar\" and \"Sheldrake\" forced the gunboats to move off westwards. The gunboats made their escape over the reefs while the ships had to beat round the outside. \"Tartar\" chased three gunboats towards Læsø, but found herself in shoal water as night approached and gave up the chase. On the way back, \"Tartar\" captured two Danish transports that it had passed while chasing the gunboats; one of them had 22 soldiers on board, with a considerable quantity of ammunition, shells, and the like, while the other contained provisions. \"Sheldrake\" managed to capture two gunboats. The Danes on the western side managed to embark on board fourteen gunboats and make their escape. The battle cost the British only two killed and 30 wounded. The Danes lost their commander, three other officers, and 50 men killed. The British took, besides the wounded, five captains, nine lieutenants, and 504 rank and file as prisoners,<ref name=\"The European magazine, and London review, Volumes 59-60 (08/06/2011).\"> \"The European magazine, and London review, Volumes 59-60\" contains a letter from Captain Maurice stating '500 prisoners, a number greater by 150 men that the garrison I command'</ref> as well as three pieces of artillery, 500 muskets, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition. In addition, \"Sheldrake\"s two captured gunboats resulted in another two lieutenants of the Danish Navy, and 119 men falling prisoner. Captain Joseph Baker of \"Tartar\" proposed taking his Danish prisoners to Randers and exchanging them for the officers and crew of , which had wrecked in February.\n\nIt was customary for senior officers to be presented with ceremonial swords, to commemorate significant victories. As well as Captain Maurice receiving a sword, Captain Torrens received two swords, one from his brother officers, and another from the non-commissioned officers and privates. This latter sword was purchased by the Royal Marines Museum, on the 200th anniversary of the battle of Anholt, and all three are on display at the Royal Marines Museum.\n\nIn 1847 the Royal Navy authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with the bar ‘Anholt 27 March 1811’ to reward this action. Forty men claimed this bar, mainly Royal Marines. Two hundred years later, in March 2011, Danish and British naval authorities attended the inauguration on the island of a new memorial to those who lost their lives in the battle.\n\n\n"}

His Feast Day is January 4.\n\nHe was born in Narbonne, apparently a grandson of Cloderic of the Ripuarian Franks. Bishops in Merovingian Gaul were ordinarily drawn from the highest levels of society. Ferréol founded a Benedictine abbey, for which he wrote a rule that survives; it regards the work of transcription in the scriptorium as the equivalent of manual labor, since it charges that the monk \"who does not turn up the earth with the plow ought to write the parchment with his fingers.\" As bishop of Uzès, Ferréol devoted himself in particular to converting the Jews within his diocese.\n\nUnder Childebert I Ferréol was banished from his see in 555, for having lived in too friendly relations with the Jews of Septimania. The thoroughly Romanized region had until recently been ruled by a Visigothic and Arian upper class, and relaxed relations with the long-established and urbane Jewish community was a Visigoth tradition. Ferréol's motive lay in hopes of making conversions, according to the \"Vita Ferreoli, apud Marcus Antonius Dominicy, Ausberti Familia Rediviva,\" published in Paris, 1648 (\"Jewish Encyclopedia\").\n\nHe was restored to his see after three years (Benedictine \"Encyclopedia\"), but now had to toe the strict Merovingian line: \"Ferréol ordered the Jews of his diocese to meet in the Church of St Theodoric, and preached to them a baptismal sermon. Some Jews abjured their faith; he forbade the others to remain in the city, and expelled them from his diocese\" in 558 (\"Jewish Encyclopedia\").\n\nFerréol makes a brief appearance in the phantasmic parade of Episode 12 (\"Cyclops\") in James Joyce's \"Ulysses\".\n\nHis sister Saint Tarsicia of Rodez (died ca 600) lived as a hermit in the Rouergue near Rodez, where she is still venerated by the Benedictines, with a feast day of January 15. She was said in error to have been a granddaughter of Clotaire II, and more accurately a granddaughter of Clotaire I and, less likely, of St. Radegunda (\"Catholic Encyclopedia\" \"Rodez\"). Thus, they were two among numerous members of the Merovingian royal house whose posthumous veneration was encouraged by the Catholic Church.\n\nAn earlier, legendary St. Ferreolus (\"Saint Ferréol\") was sent to evangelize in Besançon in the late 2nd century.

She first came to prominence in 2003, when she became the originating actor in the role of Babe Carey Chandler on the soap opera \"All My Children\". Her role as the flawed but good Babe Carey earned her a Daytime Emmy Award nomination in 2005 and recognition as being half of one of the show's most popular soap opera pairings.\n\nHavins has made guest appearances in a number of television shows, as well as a number of independent films. In 2011, she joined the main cast for \"Torchwood's\" fourth series, \"\", airing on BBC Worldwide and US premium television network Starz.\n\nAlexa Havins was born in Artesia, New Mexico on November 16, 1980. As a child and adolescent, she was raised in Chandler, Arizona, later attending Chandler High School. Coincidentally, her mother often called her Babe. Her childhood nickname was the \"Ice Maiden\" because she was \"deathly shy\".\n\nHavins was first introduced to entertainment at age 3 when she discovered dancing. At the age of five, she was already performing professionally with a jazz ensemble. However, it was not until she was discovered by renowned acting coach, Jean Fowler, who encouraged her move to New York City, that she began to turn her talent into a professional career. There, she attended the prestigious Circle in the Square Theatre School, where her love for acting would develop. While in Los Angeles, California, Havins met and studied closely under the legendary acting coach Brian Reise. The two have remained close friends, and he continues to be a mentor to her to this day.\n\nBefore her role as Babe Carey Chandler on \"All My Children\", Havins was a professional dancer. She changed her focus to acting, carrying a principle with her: \"Always hold on to your morals and values because this business can be very deceiving. I turned down a lot of things because there was nudity required,\" she said.\n\nDuring her time on the series, Havins earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series and a Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Younger Lead Actress. In a baby switch storyline set into motion by two shows, \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\", she portrayed the character on \"One Life to Live\" as well. \nOther acting compliments include her character's romantic pairing with Jacob Young's JR Chandler, often cited for their romantic chemistry. \"The on-screen chemistry she shares with Emmy-winning co-star Jacob Young is simply sizzling and truly magnetizing,\" stated soap opera site \"Soapcentral\". The two actors' dynamic as the pair made their characters well known in the top ten couples lists for one of today's most popular soap opera couples.\n\nWhile still on contract with \"All My Children\", Havins appeared in films \"Joe Killionaire\", the 2004 horror-comedy by writer-director Sean Morton, Tracy Michele Tabb's 26-minute 2005 romantic comedy \"First Kiss\", Travis Betz's 2006 horror \"Joshua\", and Ash Christian's original off-beat 2006 comedy feature \"Fat Girls\".\n\nIn addition, Havins guest-starred in a June 2006 episode of FX's critically praised series \"Rescue Me\", as well as guest-starred on the pilot episode of \"On and Off\", though this series was never aired.\n\nOn stage, Havins received credit in a production of Tennessee Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie\", where she portrayed Laura, the painfully shy girl who has a troubled relationship with her aging mother.

The film stars handicapped martial artists Jackie Conn and Frankie Shum as two men—one without arms and another with withered legs—who develop kung fu abilities and seek revenge upon the teacher who made them disabled.\n\nThe arms of Lee Ho are chopped off by the white-faced henchman known as White, while another man named Tang supervises. It is declared that Lee Ho has betrayed his master, Lin Chang Cao, the boss of the Pluahchi organization, and thus his punishment is justified. Tang is congratulated for carrying out his master's orders and is praised for his loyalty.\n\nAfter getting his arms cut off and thrown out of the dojo, Lee Ho walks into town to try to get some food. He gets beat up in a restaurant by the bouncer and left for dead with the local coffin maker. The henchmen Black and White then show up and start beating up the coffin maker and Lee Ho. Lee Ho escapes and runs for his life into the wilderness. He comes across a small rural farm and begins to work as hired help. It is here that he learns to live without his arms; he becomes resourceful at using his stump and chin as a gripping device.\n\nTang is punished by Lin Chang Cao for \"knowing too much\". Instead of having his arms chopped off, Tang is held down and has acid poured on his legs. Tang is also cast away into the wilderness to die. As he stumbles over rocks by the river, Tang meets up with Lee Ho, who is determined to get his revenge. Lee Ho drags Tang into a cave and begins to beat him. Before he can finish him off, a mysterious Old Man appears and announces that he will start training the two men so that they can get revenge on Lin Chang Cao. At the Old Man's secret training grounds, both Lee Ho and Tang learn kung fu that complements their disabilities.\n\nLin Chang Cao instructs his henchman to go attack some jewelry thieves. Cao's right-hand man, Pow, ventures with Black and White into the wilderness to take stolen jewelry away from the thieves. On their way back to the Lin Chang Cao's headquarters, they meet up with Lee Ho and Tang. Lee Ho and Tang kill Black and White, but let Pow escape back to report what happened to Lin Chang Cao. In town, Pow gets into a fight with a man named Ho in front of a whore house. Lin Chang Cao instructs Pow to hire Ho to kill Lee Ho and Tang. After Ho proves his kung fu ability to Lin Chang Cao, he is hired to be a guard at the main headquarters.\n\nThe Old Man instructs Lee Ho and Tang to sneak back into Lin Chang Cao's headquarters and steal back the Eight Jade Horses. Apparently many years ago, the Old Man found this ancient treasure only to have it stolen away by Lin Chang Cao. Under the cover of darkness, the three infiltrate Lin Chang Cao's compound and steal the box containing the horses. But they are discovered as they flee and are followed by Ho. After a big fight scene, Ho tells Lee Ho and Tang that he is a provincial government agent sent to find the missing Eight Jade Horses. He also tells them that the horses are special because they depict special kung fu techniques.\n\nHo then tries to fight Lin Chang Cao but is unable to defeat him; Lin Chang Cao has a special metal plate in his back that shields him from injuries. Lee Ho and Tang break into Lin Chang Cao's headquarters to rescue Ho. As they escape, they are again followed by henchmen. In anticipation of the final showdown, Lee Ho and Tang study the moves from the Eight Jade Horses. Lin Chang Cao appears and beats up the Old Man. Lee Ho and Tang band together and defeat Lin Chang Cao, ending his reign of terror.\n\n\nThe film stars Jackie Conn and Frankie Shum, two genuinely handicapped martial artists, as the film's disabled protagonists. Conn, a sufferer of thalidomide syndrome, portrays the armless Lee Ho, while Shum portrays Tang.\n\nNick Hartel of DVD Talk called the film \"equal parts exploitation, high camp, and crowd-pleasing action\". Though criticizing its \"paper-thin plot\", he concluded that \"The Crippled Masters\" \"is not high-art, nor a great martial arts film in the technical sense when compared to a Shaw Brothers film or Bruce Lee classic, but it's still very entertaining, exciting, and doesn't take itself too seriously.\" In 2015, Jim Vorel of \"Paste\" included the film on a list of the 100 best martial arts movies, and wrote that \"it's a genuinely disturbing flick to watch at times, but there's some legit physical talent on display\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1802945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802945", "title": "Heinrich Frauenlob", "text": "Heinrich Frauenlob\n\nHeinrich Frauenlob (between 1250 and 1260 – 29 November 1318), sometimes known as Henry of Meissen (\"Heinrich von Meißen\"), was a Middle High German poet, a representative of both the \"Sangspruchdichtung\" and \"Minnesang\" genres.\nHe was one of the most celebrated poets of the late medieval period, venerated and imitated well into the 15th century.\n\nFrauenlob was born in Meissen. He had great musical talents, and held court positions in Prague. After several years wandering as a minstrel, he established the first school of the meistersingers at Mainz.\n\nThe nickname Frauenlob (Middle High German \"Vrowenlop\"), meaning \"woman's praise\", is said to have been given to him as the result of a poetic contest with Barthel Regenbogen, in which he maintained the term \"frau\" \"lady, high-born woman\" was superior to the term \"weib\" \"woman, adult female\", but it has been shown that he already had the surname when quite young, before the contest could have taken place.\n\nThe women of Mainz are said to have carried his bier to the cathedral in appreciation of his lifelong, chivalrous devotion to their sex. His tomb was restored in 1783 by women during the \"Werther\" period of German literature, and the women of Mainz erected a monument to his memory near his tomb in 1842. In 1892 German composer Reinhold Becker (1842–1924) wrote an opera about an episode in the poet's life.\n\nFrauenlob was one of the most influential German poets of the 14th century, his contemporary reception being equalled only by Walther von der Vogelweide.\nHis works are extant in numerous manuscripts, and his style was widely imitated still in the 15th century, so that it is in many cases impossible to decide on the authenticity of a given work. His minnelied \"Alle Freude verlässt mich\" was adapted in Czech by Záviš von Zap in c. 1400. \n\nCounted among his works are thirteen minnelieder, the so-called \"Frauenleich\" (also known as the \"Marienleich\", \"Minneleich\" or \"Kreuzleich\"), a poem about the Celestial Woman of the Apocalypse, Mary, and the beloved woman of the Song of Songs, a dispute between Minne and the World, and a large number of Sangsprüche (estimates ranging at around 300 poems in 15 known melodies).\nFrauenlob and his contemporary Regenbogen are counted as the last major representatives of late medieval \"Spruchdichtung\". Tervooren (2001) sees the very popularity of Frauenlob as the culmination and end-point of the genre, after which it ceased to innovate, easing into imitation and written tradition.\nAn edition of his poems was published by Ettmüller in 1843.\n\nThe text of \"Frauenleich\" was performed by the musical ensemble \"Sequentia\" in 1990. An English translation by Barbara Newman was published in 2006.\n\n\n"}

He was born between 1490 and 1492 in Annecy, then in the Duchy of Savoy. Chapuys began his education at Annecy and from 1507, attended the University of Turin, where he remained for at least five years. Around 1512, having chosen law as a career, he continued his studies at the University of Valence. In early 1515, he attended the Sapienza University of Rome, where he attained the degree of doctor of civil and canon laws, and received the Pope's blessing.\n\nChapuys was a humanist and acted as both friend, correspondent and patron to men of similar interests. He enjoyed the friendship of the Annecy humanists Claude Blancherose and Claude Dieudonné, the German Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, and English humanists such as Thomas More. He corresponded with Erasmus, with whom he shared a deep mutual respect and admiration, although they never met.\n\nDuring the next two years, Chapuys was ordained and in July 1517, he was made a canon of the cathedral at Geneva and dean of Viry. In August 1517, he became an official of the diocese of Geneva, deputising for the bishop, John of Savoy, a cousin of the Duke of Savoy, in the episcopal court and subsequently served the Duke of Savoy and Charles de Bourbon. In 1522 he was granted the deanery of Vuillonnex.\n\nBy August 1526 he was the Duke of Bourbon's ambassador to Charles V's court in Granada and he first visited England in September 1526. In the summer of 1527, following the death of the Duke of Bourbon at the sack of Rome, he entered the service of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, working under Nicholas Perrenot, seigneur de Granvelle. He held the positions of councillor and master of requests by July 1527, and at Valladolid on 25 June 1529, he was appointed Charles V's ambassador to England.\n\nAfter going to Savoy as ambassador, Chapuys arrived in England, in late August 1529, to take over the post of resident ambassador from Don Íñigo de Mendoza, a post that had been rather unstably occupied since the forced withdrawal of Louis of Praet in 1525. He was to remain in the post from 1529 until 1545, except for brief absences from 1539 to 1540 and in 1542. He lived in Austin Friars, a neighbour of Thomas Cromwell in what later became Drapers' Hall.\n\nChapuys' legal background made him an ideal candidate to defend Henry VIII's wife Catherine of Aragon, who was also an aunt of Emperor Charles V, against the legal proceedings, known at the time as the \"King's Great Matter\", which led, eventually, to the English rejection of Papal authority and break from the Roman Catholic Church. Catherine had specifically requested Chapuys as a replacement for Mendoza, because of his legal expertise and his proficiency in Latin. Chapuys' attempts to defeat English machinations against Catherine eventually failed and Henry married Anne Boleyn. Catherine died in January 1536. It has been believed that Chapuys despised Anne and could never bring himself to say her name, referring to her only as the \"whore\" or \"concubine\".\n\nChapuys was a faithful servant to Charles V, an astute observer of men, and although he spoke and wrote fluently in French, he was a staunch opponent of France and the French, whom he loathed because of their designs on his homeland, Savoy. On one occasion, he threatened to disinherit his niece if she married a Frenchman. Although it was to support Catherine in her cause that he first came to England, it was to her daughter, Mary to whom he rendered the greater service. Chapuys, who had been devoted to Catherine, strongly disapproved of the king's treatment of his daughter. He developed an affection for Mary, who trusted him and relied on him during some of the most difficult years of her life.\n\nIn 1539, Chapuys began to suffer from gout. Nevertheless, he remained as resident ambassador in England, except for brief absences, keeping his master informed on English affairs, until May 1545. He was recalled to Antwerp, in April 1539, when diplomatic relations soured, where he remained until July 1540. On his return, he worked to restore Anglo-Imperial relations and was involved in the negotiations for the alliance of February 1543, which led to Henry VIII and Charles V declaring war on France. Chapuys accompanied Henry VIII's men to France. His health had continued to worsen in 1544 and he asked to be relieved of his post, but the Emperor allowed him to leave only after introducing his successor, François van der Delft, to the post. Chapuys was then sent to Bourbourg, near Gravelines, to negotiate until July 1545, when he was finally released from service.\n\nAfter his retirement, Chapuys resided in Leuven, in the Low Countries, now Belgium and was, by 1545, a man of considerable wealth. His income was derived from his ambassadorial pensions, the inheritance of an estate at Annecy, and various ecclesiastical sinecures, which included the deanery at Vuillonnex, canonries at Toledo, Osma and Málaga, ecclesiastical posts in Flanders and the profitable abbacy of Sant'Angelo di Brolo in Sicily, which he acquired in 1545. He had increased his wealth over the years through prudent investments in Antwerp.\n\nChapuys used his wealth to set up a college in May 1548, for promising students from his native Savoy. This \"College of Savoy\", in Leuven, of which now only the gateway survives, is incorporated into the city museum, \"Museum M\". He also founded a grammar school at Annecy in December 1551.\n\nDuring his retirement, Chapuys acted as an advisor to Charles V between 1547 and 1549. According to C.S.L. Davies, \"His last known state paper is an acute analysis of the political situation\" as Henry VIII was dying in January 1547. He was subsequently asked to recall his negotiations, and the previous attitude of the regime of Henry VIII, on the issue of the betrothal of Mary I. In his reply, he wrote he was uncertain of the possibility of convincing John Dudley to agree to any proposed marriage. At the end of the letter, Chapuys wrote that Mary had \"no other desire or hope than to be bestowed at the hands of your majesty.\" He felt nothing was more fond in Mary's mind than marriage.\n\nChapuys had a son, Césare, who was made legitimate in 1545, and who died in 1549. The death of his son ensured that the college and grammar school that he had founded would benefit from his vast fortune on his own demise. In 1555 he decided that his English pension should go towards setting up a scholarship for English students at Leuven.\n\nEustace Chapuys died 21 January 1556 and was buried in the chapel of the College of Savoy. A portrait of Chapuys, which may be contemporary, is located at the musée-château d'Annecy at Annecy.\n\n\n\n"}

She finally weighed anchor and departed on 3 February 1862, but \"Tuscarora\" was unable to pursue her as English law required that two belligerent vessels leave port separated by not less than 24 hours. Disgusted, Comdr. Craven sailed for Gibraltar where, upon his arrival on 12 February, he found the raider  — Comdr.

In 2008, he was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors.\n\nThough his parents lived in Brčko, Nikolić was born in Sarajevo, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, due to his pregnant mother, Krista, suddenly going into labour while visiting her sister in Sarajevo. Young Aleksandar enjoyed a privileged upbringing courtesy of his wealthy father, Đorđe Nikolić, who had him at the age of 62.

Muchamore grew up in Tufnell Park and attended St. Johns Upper Holloway and Acland Burghley School, leaving with a D in A-Level Economics and aspired to be either an architect, photographer or writer.\n\nRobert Muchamore started writing the CHERUB novels because his nephew in Australia could not find any novels that he liked reading. He tried to write novels that he would have enjoyed reading when he was an adolescent, a time when he remembers being too old for children's novels but not old enough to read adult novels.\n\nThe CHERUB series follows the life of a character named James Adams (formerly James Choke) and his younger half-sister Lauren Adams (formerly Lauren Onions), a member of CHERUB (Charles Henderson's Espionage Research Unit B), a top-secret branch of the British Secret Service. The organisation recruits orphaned children and trains them as spies. Once qualified, they are used to investigate targets ranging from international terrorists to gang leaders. As children, they are considered innocent by their targets. CHERUB agents start basic training at the age of ten. Basic training is a gruelling, tiresome 100-day course that prepares CHERUBs for the dangers they could face during missions. CHERUB agents are then eligible for missions upon completion. Once passed basic training, agents take part in missions, before retiring at the age of seventeen.\n\nMuchamore has written and published seventeen CHERUB novels and a World Book Day novella which combined have sold over 15 million copies.\n\nThe CHERUB series has been sold in more than twenty countries and has won various awards. Most notably, \"The Recruit\" has won eight literature awards.\n\nMuchamore has authored a second series of novels about the origins of CHERUB entitled Henderson's Boys. The first, \"The Escape\", was released on 5 February 2009 in the UK. Six novels followed, with the seventh and final novel, \"Scorched Earth\", being released in February 2013.\n\nThe Henderson's Boys novels are set during World War II and follow Charles Henderson, a British secret agent, as he creates the organisation later featured in the CHERUB series. The novels centre around four children: Marc Kilgour, Paul Clarke, Rosie Clarke, and PT Bivott.\n\nThe second series of CHERUB books is subtitled \"Aramov\", so-called because the antagonists of the first three books of the series are the Aramov Clan. The first novel, \"People's Republic\", was released in August 2011. \"Guardian Angel\" was released in September 2012, \"Black Friday\" was released in September 2013, and \"Lone Wolf\" was released in September 2014. The final book in the series, \"New Guard\", was released in June 2016.\n\nIn 2014 it was announced that he would be writing another novel, \"Rock War\", which has no connection to CHERUB or Henderson Boys. It was published on 27 February 2014, and follows the story of Jay, Summer and Dylan entering a musical competition. A novella titled \"The Audition\" was released for World Book Day 2014. The second book in the series, \"Boot Camp\", was published in October 2015. The third book in the series, \"Gone Wild\", was published in October 2016, while the fourth and final book in the series, \"Crash Landing\", was published in October 2017.\n\nIn February 2019, Muchamore announced that he would be writing a new series, based on Robin Hood and set in the 2020s. The series is planned to span at least four books.\n\n\"Hacking Heists & Flaming Arrows\", the first book in the series, was published on 2 April 2020.\n\n\"Piracy, Paintballs & Zebras\", the second book in the series, will be published in January 2021.\n\n\"Jetskis, Swamps & Smugglers\", the third, will be published in late 2021.\n\n\"Home\" is another novel written by Robert Muchamore. It was deemed too violent to be published by any children's publisher that Muchamore approached, so it was never published. The story follows civil war in an unstated central African state, but most probably the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The full novel has been released by the author online.\n\nIn between writing \"The Recruit\" and \"Class A\", Muchamore wrote a novel called \"Little Criminals\". He posted the first two chapters onto the CHERUB series official forum, to see what his fans thought. Unlike \"Home\", Muchamore has not published the rest of the text on his fan forum because he still holds out some hope that it will be published.\n\n\"Killer T\" is Muchamore's first standalone novel, and was published in September 2018. It is set in Las Vegas in the near future, when genetic modifications are commonplace. It tells a story bridging 10 years of the lives of Harry and Charlie, aged 13 and 12 at the start of the book.\n\n\"Arctic Zoo\" is Muchamore's second standalone novel, and was published in July 2019. It follows two teenagers living very different lives, and features themes of protest, sexuality, mental health and flawed leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He joined the Nazi party in November 1929 (nr. 170257). In 1933, Naumann joined the SA in a full-time capacity and then became an official and officer of police. He joined the SD in 1935.

Under his command, he admitted that his Einsatzgruppe possessed three gas vans which \"were used to exterminate human beings\".\n\nAfter capture by the Allies, Naumann stood trial at Nuremberg. During the proceedings he repeatedly stated that he did not consider his actions during his tenure as commanding officer of Einsatzgruppe B wrong. When asked on the witness stand whether he saw anything morally wrong about the Führer's orders, he replied specifically that he:\n\nconsidered the decree to be right because it was part of our aim of the war and, therefore, it was necessary.\n\nHe was found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity and belonging to illegal organizations, namely the SS and the SD.

It left 7 people dead and enormous damage across the region.\n\nOn July 22, 2003, a progressive derecho with straight-line winds in excess of 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) struck Crittenden, DeSoto, Fayette, and Shelby Counties, including the city of Memphis. The storm passed through the area between 6 and 7 am.\n\nOver 300,000 homes, 70% of Shelby County, were left without power in the wake of the storm. Two individuals were left dead as a direct result of the storm, with several more deaths due to fires caused by unattended candles or generator accidents.\n\nThis storm was very similar to the derecho that went through Kansas City, Missouri in June 1982, as well as one that hit St. Louis, Missouri on July 19, 2006.\n\nThe storm became commonly known in the area as \"Hurricane Elvis\" as its winds reached the level of a Category 2 hurricane. As the storm crossed the Mississippi River into Downtown Memphis, a barge recorded an unofficial wind reading of 108 mph (174 km/h). Coincidentally, the National Hurricane Center's rotation of tropical cyclone names had identified that season's \"D\" storm, \"Danny,\" only two days earlier, thus the region's next real hurricane, Hurricane Erika (2003), would also start with an \"E.\" \nThe National Weather Service refers to the storm as the \"Mid South Derecho of 2003\".\n\nIt took two weeks to restore power to many of those who had lost it in the storm. Temperatures reached past 90°F (32°C) leaving many residents unprotected from dangerously hot conditions. Many Memphians were distressed that though they had survived hurricane-like conditions and weeks without power, little national news coverage was given to the event. Shelby County Mayor A.C. Wharton said in a CNBC interview that he was \"Feeling a bit lonely, because it seems that from a national perspective it never happened. We suffered a 'dry-land hurricane'... yet we see on the national news over in Galveston, they got more coverage on a hurricane that never did occur.\" In contrast, less than a month later, national news coverage was extensive when New York City residents were left without power for a few hours.\n\nIn 2009, the United States Department of Homeland Security claimed that the city of Memphis owed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) $2 million. It claimed that Memphis misspent the money that was originally given to help clean up the city following Hurricane Elvis.\n\n\n"}

(also known as Filmways Pictures and Filmways Television) was a television and film production company founded by American film executive Martin Ransohoff, and Edwin Kasper in 1952. It is probably best remembered as the production company of CBS’ “rural comedies” of the 1960s, including \"Mister Ed\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Petticoat Junction\", and \"Green Acres\", as well as the comedy-drama \"The Trials of O'Brien\", the western \"Dundee and the Culhane\", the adventure show \"Bearcats!\", the police drama \"Cagney & Lacey\", and \"The Addams Family\". Notable films the company produced include \"The Sandpiper\", \"The Cincinnati Kid\", \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\", \"Ice Station Zebra\", \"Summer Lovers\", \"The Burning\", \"King\", Brian De Palma's \"Dressed to Kill\", and \"Blow Out\" and \"Death Wish II\".\n\nFilmways acquired famous companies throughout the years, such as Heatter-Quigley Productions, Ruby-Spears Productions and American International Pictures. It was also the owner of the film distributor Sigma III Corporation (\"Closely Watched Trains\", \"Hi, Mom!\"), Wally Heider Recording, Studio 3 Inc.\n\nFilmways was formed by Martin Ransohoff and Edwin Kasper in 1952, who would part with Filmways 5 years later. The company originally produced television commercials and documentary films. In 1959, Filmways entered the television sitcom arena in a big way, when many executives of McCadden Productions, (a production company founded by comedian and actor, George Burns) decided to join Filmways after McCadden filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1959. Filmways TV Productions was formed and named former McCadden exec, Al Simon as its new president and produced its first TV series, 21 Beacon Street. During that time, McCadden also produced the pilot which would later become the series \"Mister Ed\". Burns sold the rights to Filmways, and Burns and director Arthur Lubin formed The Mister Ed Company as a joint venture. As a result, \"Mister Ed\" became a smash hit. In 1962, Filmways produced its biggest hit, \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" for CBS, created by Paul Henning, another McCadden exec. In 1966, the company acquired Heatter-Quigley Productions, the game show producer known for their biggest hit, \"Hollywood Squares\". In 1969, it bought Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma County, California, outside of San Francisco, and Wally Heider Recording with studios in Hollywood and San Francisco, along with Studio 3 Inc in Hollywood. In 1972, Ransohoff left Filmways as president.\n\nFilmways housed studios in Manhattan at 246 East 127th Street, which were built for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1974, it acquired book publisher Grosset & Dunlap from American Financial Group. In May 1975, it bought the television syndication firm Rhodes Productions from Taft Broadcasting. In 1976, Richard L. Bloch became CEO. In 1978, it acquired Ruby-Spears Productions, which had launched a year earlier. In 1979, after Arkoff's retirement, Filmways purchased American International Pictures. Their TV subsidiary, AITV, became a Filmways' new syndication division in 1980, spinning off Rhodes into an independent corporation.\n\nFilmways had lost nearly $20 million during the nine months ending in November 1981. However, it partially exited bankruptcy by selling a few of its previously acquired assets. In 1981, Ruby-Spears Productions was sold to Taft Broadcasting and Sears Point Raceway was sold to Speedway Motorsports. In 1982, Grosset & Dunlap was sold to G. P. Putnam's Sons.\n\nIn 1982, Filmways was acquired by Orion Pictures (with E. M. Warburg Pincus & Company and Home Box Office for its pay and cable television rights). Filmways was then reincorporated as Orion Pictures Corporation on August 31, 1982.\n\nMost productions ended with the announcement, “This has been a Filmways presentation”. For some shows, the voice-over was made by a cast member:\n\nToday, most of the Filmways library, including \"Green Acres\", \"The Addams Family\", \"Cagney & Lacey\" (continued by Orion), \"Death Wish II\" (a Cannon film), \"The Hollywood Squares\", and \"Mister Ed\" is now owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (also owner of Orion which it purchased in 1998, and the pre-1988 Cannon Films library) until MGM quietly relaunched Orion Pictures on September 11, 2014.\n\nCBS holds distribution rights to \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" and \"Petticoat Junction\". Viacom (the parent of CBS from 1999–2005, actually started as CBS’ syndication arm) syndicated these two programs since the 1970s.

Laserna Pinzón is credited for being the founder of the Los Andes University in Bogotá, which was incorporated in 1948 and is a private institution modeled on the United States liberal arts educational system. He also served as Senator of Colombia, and Ambassador to France and Austria and is an author of several books.\n\nHe was born in Paris, France on August 21, 1923 to Colombian parents, Francisco Laserna Bravo and Elena Pinzón Castillo, and was raised first in Colombia where he attended the Instituto La Salle and then from 1931 to 1932 in Queens in NYC. He graduated from the Gimnasio Moderno in 1940 and went on to study Law for three years at Our Lady of the Rosary University to later change his career and move to the United States to attend Columbia University where he completed his undergraduate studies in Mathematics, Physics, and Humanities in 1948. He would go on to obtain a master's degree at Princeton University and to study German and philosophy at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, and he later obtained a Doctorate at the Free University of Berlin. For his life's work he was awarded a Doctorate Honoris Causa by Brandeis University.\n\nMario Laserna Pinzón is widely admired in his country as an educator, a politician, and a passionate seeker of knowledge, with numerous books and studies to his credit. During the late 1940s and 1950s he became acquainted with many important scientific figures of the day, including Albert Einstein, whom he met while studying at Princeton, and Nicolás Gómez Dávila, his mentor.\n\nIn 1948, upon graduating from Columbia, he returned to Colombia and dedicated himself to the creation of a private secular institution of higher learning in Bogotá. His dream became a reality on November 16, 1948 when Los Andes University was founded, institution of which he became rector between 1953 and 1954. He also served as rector of the National University of Colombia (1958–1960).\n\nGiven his high-profile Laserna was absorbed into politics by those who wanted to present the world with one of the best examples of Colombian intellect, and so he served as the Colombian Ambassador to his native France (1976–1979) and to Austria (1987–1990), served in the Senate of Colombia and served as councillor of Bogotá.\n\nHe worked in politics as a philosopher interested in learning the workings of government and people which led him to run as Senator representing the radical liberal party of the M-19 Democratic Alliance, even though he himself belonged to the Colombian Conservative Party, he said he joined the M-19 in spite of being a conservative because he \"\"wanted to know how the people who had been [hiding] in the mountain and had returned to civil life thought. Also because they had Bolivarian roots\"\", as he himself was a believer of Bolivarianism.\n\nAs a Senator he had to answer to accusations of working with the fugitive Roberto Soto Prieto who had allegedly stolen US$13.5 million and with whom Laserna had connections in Austria through his work as Ambassador, at which time Soto Prieto was an alleged refugee in that country, and through alleged business deals in which Soto was found to be indirectly involved. At the request of the Colombian Minister of Foreign Affairs Noemí Sanín the last five ambassadors to Austria and all employees of the embassy were investigated by the Inspector General of Colombia and the Attorney General of Colombia, among those was Mario Laserna Pinzón. Laserna was later cleared of all charges in respect to the case.\n\nBecause of his life's work and contribution to the country, President Álvaro Uribe Vélez honored him with the Order of Boyacá in the Rank of the Grand Cross, the highest civilian honour bestowed by the Republic of Colombia.\n\nMario Laserna was a very prolific reader and writer, which led him to write for various newspapers and to become the director of \"Revista Semana\" and the newspaper \"La República\". He also authored various books and essays on Colombian history and government, development in the Third World, and philosophy.\n"}

One of the most outstanding dancers of the eighteenth century.\n\nLe Picq was the grandson of the renowned French dance teacher Antoine Le Picq (1673-1759), and the son of a dancer and dance teacher Jean Felix Charles Le Picq (born 1713) and his wife Marie Magdaleine Kugler (1720-1775).\n\nInitially, he learned to dance in Paris with Jean-Baptiste-François Dehesse / Deshayes (1705-1779). Later he was in Stuttgart (1760-1764) a pupil of Jean Georges Noverre (1727–1810), one of the creators of modern ballet (\"ballet d'action\"). In the years 1765-1777 his stage partner was a well-known Italian dancer Anna Binetti. He was called the \"Apollo of the Dance\" and performed in many countries, such as Württemberg (1760-1764 and 1770), Austria (1764-1765, 1767-1769 and 1771), Poland (1765-1767 and 1785), Italy (1769-1782), France (1776), Spain (1780), England (1782-1785) and Russia (1786-1803). In the Mozart aria \"Rivolgete a lui lo sguardo\" (an alternate aria from Così Fan Tutte), Guglielmo boasts that he and Ferrando dance so elegantly \"that Le Picq would bow before us\".\n\nIn 1786 Charles Le Pic was invited to Russia, to St. Petersburg to head the Imperial ballet. He arrived in St. Petersburg with his wife, who also got an invitation to work in the Imperial ballet, and his stepson. The family remained forever in Russia. He was a huge influence on the development of Russian ballet. Thanks to him, the Noverre' book \"Letters on the dance\" (fr: \"Lettres sur la danse \") was published in Russia (in French) in 1803. He advised in 1801 to invite to Russia the French choreographer Charles Didelot.\n\nHis wife and stage partner was Bavarian ballerina Gertrude Ablöscher-Rossi (1756-1799). His stepson was Carlo Rossi (1775–1849), became the famous Russian architect, son of son of Gertrude's first husband, Italian dancer and choreographer Domenico Rossi. The children of Charles Le Picq and Gertrude were: Caroline (the second wife of the Spanish composer Vincente Martín y Soler), Henriette Wilhelmine (wife of a German pharmacist Johann Moritz Bartels) and Marie Gertrude (wife of a French dancer and ballet master Auguste Antoine Poireau), they also had a son Charles. They were short dancers in Russia at the end of the 18th century.\n"}

{"id": "1803101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803101", "title": "BOINC Credit System", "text": "BOINC Credit System\n\nWithin the BOINC platform for volunteer computing, the BOINC Credit System helps volunteers keep track of how much CPU time they have donated to various projects. This ensures users are returning accurate results for both scientific and statistical reasons.\n\nOnline distributed computing relies heavily, if not completely, on volunteer computers. For this reason, projects such as SETI@home and other BOINC projects depend on a complicated balance among long-term users and the cycle of new users and retiring users.\n\n\nThe basis for the BOINC credit system is the cobblestone, named after Jeff Cobb of SETI@home. By definition, 200 cobblestones are awarded for one day of work on a computer that can meet either of two benchmarks:\n\nThe actual computational difficulty needed to run a given work unit is the basis for the number of credits that should be granted. The BOINC system allows for work of any length to be processed and have identical amounts of credit issued to a user. In so doing, BOINC uses benchmarks to measure the speed of a system, combining that figure with the amount of time required for a work unit to be processed. The interface then can “guess” at the amount of credit a user should receive. Since systems have many variables, including the amount of RAM, the processor speed, and specific architectures of different motherboards and CPUs, there can be wide discrepancies in the number of credits that different computers (and projects) judge a user to have earned.\n\nMost projects require a consensus to be reached by having multiple hosts return the same work unit. If they all agree, then the credit is calculated and all hosts receive the same amount regardless of what they asked for. Each project can use their own policy depending on what they see is best for their specific needs. In general, the top and bottom claimed credits are dropped and an average of the remaining is taken. However, certain other projects award a flat amount per work unit returned and validated.\n\nCredits are tracked internally for computers, users, and teams. When a computer processes and returns a work unit, it receives no credit for that action alone. It must first have that work unit validated by the given, project-specific method. Once validated, the computer is granted credit, which can be less than, equal to, or greater than what was requested. This amount is immediately added to the computer, user, and team total. If a work unit is returned past the given deadline (in most cases) or is found to be inaccurate, it is marked as invalid and results in no credit. Users and teams commonly determine world rank by comparing the total number of credits accumulated. This highly favors users and teams that have been around for the longest time. This makes it extremely difficult for new users to rapidly gain ground in the rankings, even if they are running many computers. That said, given the exponential increase in computing power of the average PC, it is relatively easy to surpass inactive BOINC users who have earned all of their points on obsolete machines—even if they were at one time ranked highly. Thus, the highest ranked BOINC users will generally be the ones who are actively crunching.\n\nTo find the useful amount of work provided by a computer, a special calculation called recent average credit (RAC) is used. This calculation is designed to estimate the number of credits a computer, user, and team will accumulate on an average day. Due to the many variables not taken into account, including the inconsistency of host processing, time it takes to validate work units, discrepancies in benchmarks, and possible project down time, the RAC calculation has proved to be only a guide. Additionally, RAC is independent of computers, users, and teams, meaning their respective data cannot be simply added up. RAC was originally meant to help scientists understand the computational power available to them. Today, this calculation allows for increased competition among users and teams by allowing even new users to quickly move up in rank based on RAC, which should theoretically reflect how fast work is being processed.\n\nBOINC projects export statistical information in the form of XML files, and make it available for anyone to download. Many different third-party statistical websites have been developed to track the progress of BOINC projects. These sites track computers, users, teams, and countries within individual projects and across many projects. Many different sites provide summary graphics, which can be used on web pages that automatically update to contain the statistical information for the specified user or team.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1803102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803102", "title": "James Ah Koy", "text": "James Ah Koy\n\nSir James Michael Ah Koy, is a Fijian businessman, politician, and diplomat of Chinese and Fijian descent. He is Executive Chairman of Kelton Investments, the IT service provider Datec Group Ltd., Honorary Consul of the Republic of Georgia to Fiji and a board director of forty-six companies. He served as a Cabinet Minister in the 1990s, and was a Senator from 2001 to 2006. He is Fiji's past ambassador to China. He served until mid-2010, when he was replaced by Esala Teleni.\n\nAh Koy's first foray into politics was in 1966, when he stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in the general elections that year. In the early 1980s, he became manager of a family investment company owned by the then-Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, and was subsequently selected by Mara's political party, the Alliance Party, as a candidate for one of eight seats then reserved for General Electors in the House of Representatives in the parliamentary election of 1982. In 1991–1993, he led a legal challenge to the law requiring all multiracial people to register on the General Electors' roll, which at the time enrolled all Fijian citizens who are neither indigenous nor of Indian or Rotuman ancestry. The court ruled that as he was registered in the Native Land Register (\"Vola ni Kawa Bula\", or VKB, in Fijian), he was entitled to be registered as a Fijian. He subsequently succeeded getting the law amended to give multiracial people the option of registering on either the General Electors' roll or on an ethnic role (Fijian, Indo-Fijian, or Rotuman) on which any of their ancestors would have been entitled to enroll. This change was later written into the Constitution, and allowed Ah Koy to stand for election from an ethnic Fijian communal constituency. (All seats in the House of Representatives were communal prior to 1999, and 46 of the 71 seats are still communal, elected from closed ethnic roles of voters registered as Fijians, Indo-Fijians, Rotumans, or General Electors).\n\nAh Koy served as Minister for Commerce, Industry, Trade, and Public Enterprises in the government of Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka from 1994 to 1997, when he became Minister for Finance, a position he held till his Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei lost the parliamentary election of 1999. He retained his Kadavu Fijian Communal Constituency at that election, but subsequently lost it in the House of Representatives in the election of 2001. He returned to Parliament in 2003, however, when he was appointed to the Senate by the Kadavu Provincial Council to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Ratu Sela Nanovo. His appointment came about at a time when the members of the Kadavu Provincial Council were desperate for a way to salvage their province's financially troubled shipping company, the \"Bulou ni Ceva\". They approached Ah Koy, given his business background and as one of the key players who had arranged the purchase of the ship from the People's Republic of China. Allegations were made that he agreed to help on the condition that he be appointed as the province's nominee to the Senate, but in his maiden speech, he attacked the company concerned, saying that the people of Kadavu had fallen victim to a Chinese company with \"a very unsavory reputation.\"\n\nAh Koy is a flamboyant politician known for his uninhibited expression of controversial views. He is a Christian fundamentalist who regularly quotes from the Bible in parliamentary debates and has castigated Fijian churches for setting a poor example of racism, which he blames for the failure of the mostly Hindu and Muslim Indo-Fijians to convert to Christianity in large numbers.\n\nOn 12 May 2005, Ah Koy became embroiled in controversy over the Fijian translation of the Bible, saying that its use of the word \"\"Kalougata\"\" invoked pagan deities, the snake gods worshipped by the ancestors of Fijians living today. This was, he said, the root cause of generational curses afflicting the country. \"\"Coups, murders, rapes, violence, brutality, burglaries, incest, rebellion, homosexuality and other forms of social ills and criminality are a product of a generational curse happening mostly in the indigenous Fijian community,\"\" the Daily Post quoted him as saying. He attributed this curse to the frequent use of the word \"\"Kalougata,\"\" which, he said, actually invoked a curse on the recipient rather than the intended blessing. He called on the Bible Society to come up with new words to replace the offending word. Ah Koy was supported by the Reverend Josateki Koroi, a former president of the Methodist Church who was deposed in the 1987 coups, who said that he totally agreed with his comments.\n\nAh Koy is also a very strong supporter of Israel, having once served as that country's honorary consul to Fiji (in 1985). Speaking on the floor of the Senate on 26 August 2004, he caused an uproar when he declared that Fiji would be \"continually cursed\" by God for its failure to stand with Israel in United Nations resolutions. (Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase is himself known as a friend of Israel, but has not given unconditional support at the United Nations).\n\nIn the same debate (26 August 2004) in which Ah Koy had prophesied curses on the country for failing to support Israel, he accused the Qarase government of responsibility for the death of former First Lady \"Ro Lady\" Lala Mara. He alleged that sources close to her family had told him she had suffered a fatal heart attack after hearing the distressing news that her son-in-law, \"Ratu\" Epeli Ganilau, was to be dismissed (under pressure from the government) as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, \"the last straw\" after her husband's death three months earlier. His comments drew a strong rebuke from the Chairman of the Kadavu Provincial Council, which Ah Koy represents in the Senate. \"Ratu\" Joe Nawalowalo called his speech \"gutter material\" which \"belittled\" the close relationship Adi Lala had enjoyed with the province.\n\nPartly because of his close relationship with former Prime Minister Rabuka, Ah Koy was accused by some of involvement in the Rabuka and Speight coups of 1987 and 2000. No firm evidence ever came to light, and on both occasions he took legal action against media responsible for broadcasting such allegations. The Auckland High Court in New Zealand ruled in Ah Koy's favour each time. The \"Auckland Star\" (which had printed the allegations of his complicity in the Rabuka coups) went into voluntary liquidation soon afterwards, while Radio New Zealand and Television New Zealand were ordered by the court to apologise publicly to Ah Koy and his family.\n\nIn public and parliamentary speeches, Ah Koy has taken a strong stand against what he sees as the racist policies of the present government.\n\nIn a Senate debate on 1 March 2004, fellow-Senator Apisai Tora called Ah Koy a \"Chinaman,\" a term generally considered a pejorative. Ah Koy strongly objected to the term, and Tora apologised three days later.\n\nOn 28 June 2005, Ah Koy declared his total opposition to the government's controversial proposal to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission, with the power (subject to presidential approval) to compensate victims and parton perpetrators of the 2000 coup. He labelled the legislation as a \"\"diabolically conceived bill with its origins in hell.\"\" Ah Koy's opposition flew in the face of its endorsement by the Kadavu Provincial Council. He acknowledged that his defiance of the council's stand might cost him his seat in the Senate, but said that he would not shrink from standing for truth as he saw it. \"\"This Bill is anti-Bible and every Christian should vote against it if they are true to the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Israel,\"\" he said. He charged that the government's real motive in promoting the bill was to save the skins of some of its members who were being pursued by the police. He criticized Ratu Nawalowalo and the Provincial Council for supporting the bill without consulting the tribes and villages of the province.\n\nAh Koy renewed his attack on the bill on 26 August. Speaking in the Senate, he said that he and his family had been subjected to threats after the coup, in the wake of false accusations that he had organized and financed the coup. They were the victims of the people who had planned the coup - who were still at large, he alleged, adding that George Speight was just a pawn in the hands of those who planned the operation. The legislation was nothing more than serving one's own neck, he claimed. He reiterated his support for Military Commander Frank Bainimarama's campaign against the bill.\n\nIn July 2005, the Samoan Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II, honoured Ah Koy with the Papalii title, in recognition of his contribution to the economy of Pacific Island nations. His Datec Group has subsidiary companies in Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, Australia, and New Zealand. Ah Koy, who was described by the Fiji Times as \"speechless and lost for words\" when he received the award, spoke of the importance of contributing to the economies of other countries, employing local people, and obeying their laws.\n\nIn the Queen's Birthday Honours of 2006, Ah Koy was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), on the nomination of the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister, Sir Michael Somare. He thus became Sir James Ah Koy, effective from 19 June 2006, a spokesman for Papua New Guinea's Governor-General, Sir Paulias Matane, announced on the 17th.\n\nOn 7 February 2006, Ah Koy announced his intention to contest the upcoming parliamentary election, for his old House of Representatives seat as an independent candidate.

He blamed ethnic nationalism for his defeat.\n\nAh Koy's father was born in China. His mother was a native of Kadavu, though her mother hailed from the village of Nasogo in Ba Province. \n\nAh Koy has four children (Michael, Anthony, Monica, and Carolyn) with the late Lavinia Ah Koy, a former parliamentary secretary, to whom he was married for many years prior to her death from complications relating to kidney failure in 2003. He subsequently remarried.\n"}

{"id": "1803135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803135", "title": "Michał Kamiński", "text": "Michał Kamiński\n\nMichał Tomasz Kamiński (born 28 March 1972) is a Polish politician and a member of the Sejm with the Union of European Democrats. He was chairman of the European Conservatives and Reformists in the European Parliament from July 2009 until March 2011.\n\nKamiński was a founder member of the Christian National Union (ZChN) in 1989, and served on its board from 1995 to 2001. Kamiński was elected to the Sejm in 1997 for Solidarity Electoral Action, which included ZChN. In 2001, he joined the Right Alliance (PP), which merged with Law and Justice (PiS) the following year, having been reelected on the PP-PiS joint ticket in 2001. He was elected to the European Parliament in 2004, representing Warsaw. He stepped down to become Secretary of State for Media Relations in Chancellery of the President. He was returned as an MEP in the 2009 election, and was elected chairman of the new European Conservatives and Reformists group. In November 2010, he left PiS to form the more liberal Poland Comes First (PJN); while remaining in the ECR, he stepped down as chairman in March 2011.\n\nKamiński attended XLIX Liceum Ogólnokształcące in Warsaw, and then studied International Relations and Diplomacy at the University of Warsaw. He first entered politics as a teenager, joining the National Revival of Poland () when he was 15. The present day NOP is considered to be anti-Semitic, though Kamiński has defended his membership of the organisation, arguing that it was a symbol of his opposition to communism and that the party was not anti-Semitic when he was a member. In 1989 he was one of the founding members of the Christian National Union, the youngest founder at 17 years of age. He was a radio and newspaper journalist and radio producer in Bydgoszcz and Łomża. He frequently published in Catholic journals and newspapers and before 1989 his work appeared in the underground press. During the 1995 Polish presidential election, he was press spokesman for Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz. Kamiński says he taught himself English by listening to illegal BBC World Service broadcasts.\n\nHe was elected to the Third Sejm on 21 September 1997 as part of the Solidarity Electoral Action (\"Akcja Wyborcza Solidarność\") grouping of parties for the Łomża Voivodeship, and later Podlaskie Voivodeship.\n\nIn 1999, he visited London to present a gorget embossed with an image of the Virgin Mary to former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet along with Marek Jurek and the journalist Tomasz Wołek. \"This was the most important meeting of my whole life. Gen Pinochet was clearly moved and extremely happy with our visit,\" Kamiński told the BBC's Polish service. In the same year, Kamiński won a journalists' award for being the best speaker in the Sejm. However, he later defended his visit to see General Pinochet, saying \"we lived in this country subject to communist propaganda. We had little access to the real information, so for many Poles – not just me – this defence of Pinochet was across centre-right political parties in Poland and other eastern European countries at that time. It was my mistake, I admit it. I think every politician has the right to some mistakes. I made this mistake by just reversing the communist propaganda. It was a mistake that decent people of the left made when they were living under right-wing dictatorships – the kind of mistake where you just reverse the black and white propaganda. Today I know much more about Pinochet and I will never call him a hero again. It’s a question of context\".\n\nIn July 2000, Kamiński used the word \"pedał\" (a derogatory Polish word for homosexual, usually translated into English as \"fag\" or \"queer\") in a TV interview to refer to gay rights campaigners. When asked by the reporter if such a term is offensive, his reply translates as: \"That's how people speak, what should I say? They are fags.\" In a 2009 interview with Iain Dale he admitted the word was offensive and that he would never use it again. He confirmed he has homosexual friends and stated that he respects \"the right [of gay people] to be treated with civility\". In the same interview he expressed his pride that Poland was one of the first countries in Europe to decriminalize homosexuality and said that he has nothing against civil partnership legislation and \"would consider voting yes\" if he was still a member of the Polish Parliament. Also in 2000, he visited his first Conservative Party Conference, with Czech MEP Jan Zahradil.\n\nHe became a member of the Right Alliance (\"Przymierze Prawicy\") in 2001, and then joined the new conservative party Law and Justice (\"Prawo i Sprawiedliwość\") in 2002. Kamiński was re-elected to the Sejm, for its Fourth Term, on 23 September 2001, representing the constituency of Białystok. Law and Justice increased its Parliamentary number from 18 to 45.\n\nHe was a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn 2001 he was alleged by the Anti-Defamation League of organising to prevent a commemoration of the World War II murder of Polish Jews by Polish gentiles in the town of Jedwabne. He has been quoted as saying that no apology should be forthcoming to the Jews of Jedwabne – until Jews had themselves apologised for their part in Soviet atrocities during the Soviet occupation, an idea not uncommon in parts of central and eastern Europe which had been part of the Soviet empire. He said “My position is that there were acts of collaboration of the Jewish people with the Soviet army when the Soviet army came to Poland. It’s a fact. It’s a historical fact… If you are asking the Polish nation to apologise for the crime made in Jedwabne, you would require from the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewish Communists did in Eastern Poland\".\n\nThen-Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski issued an apology for the atrocity, but the issue was hugely divisive. As the deputy in the Sejm responsible for the area, Kamiński expressed his opposition to a generalised apology, arguing that the individuals responsible should instead be singled out as criminals. In an interview with Martin Bright, political editor of the UK's Jewish Chronicle in 2009, he said “From the very beginning I was saying as a human being, as a Pole, that Jedwabne was a terrible crime, unfortunately committed by the Polish people. My point was from the very start: we are ashamed of these people, we have to condemn them, we have to judge them if they are still alive. But I don’t want to take the whole responsibility for this crime for the whole Polish nation.”\n\nIn an interview with political blogger Iain Dale, he said \"if there were any doubts about my past I will give you the ultimate argument. When I became Secretary of State of Poland, I received a top NATO clearance, so it’s not about Polish politics now – it’s about a NATO clearance. I don’t think there can be any doubts about my political views and my past if I can receive a top NATO clearance.\"\n\nStephen Pollard has said \"As Editor of the Jewish Chronicle, and founding chairman of the \"European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism\", I am more alive than most to the dangers of the newly resurgent antisemitism. But there is simply no evidence that Mr Kaminski is an antisemite, only a series of politically motivated assertions. It is not Kaminski who is odious; it is those using antisemitism as a tool for their own political ends who deserve contempt\".\n\nKamiński was first elected to the European Parliament on 16 June 2004. During his first term in the Parliament, he was a Vice-Chairman of the (now defunct) Union for a Europe of Nations group and sat on the European Parliament's Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. He was a substitute for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a vice-chair of the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and a substitute for the Delegation for relations with the countries of Central America. He was one of the most active Polish MEPs, and wrote a report examining possible Ukrainian membership of the EU. Kamiński is considered a key ally of President Lech Kaczyński, as well as being a modernising, moderating influence on Law and Justice in contrast to other Law and Justice politicians such as leader Jarosław Kaczyński. The BBC described him as \"a 'spin doctor' – media-savvy, smartly dressed with fashionable spectacles, one of the masterminds of conservative President Lech Kaczynski's successful election campaign in 2005\". On 13 July 2007 Kamiński was appointed Secretary of State in the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland, responsible for media policy. He vacated his European Parliament seat on 6 August, and was replaced by Ewa Tomaszewska. In his maiden speech, Kamiński demonstrated his admiration for Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan:\n\nHe was re-elected as an MEP for Warsaw in 2009, now sitting in the new European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR). In the inaugural session of the 2009–2014 European Parliament session, he was the official ECR candidate for one the Vice-President of the European Parliament positions. However, he was not elected, largely due to the intervention of the British Conservative Edward McMillan-Scott who ran as an independent candidate from the ECR group. McMillan-Scott ran, as he was \"unhappy with a lack of debate about Kamiński's candidacy and the controversial new alliance\". Kamiński then became the first permanent chairman of the ECR group as a compromise measure, with Timothy Kirkhope stepping aside, in order for him to take up the position. He is the first person from Central Europe to lead one of the political groups of the European Parliament. As chairman of the ECR, he is a member of the exclusive Conference of Presidents.\n\nDue to their close links with the ECR, being founding partners, the British Conservative Party have been associated with Kamiński in his role as chair. Left-wing magazine The New Statesman reported that the US administration consequently had \"concerns about Cameron among top members of the team\", according to quotes from an unnamed Democratic Party source. The article further quoted David Rothkopf in saying that the issue \"makes [Cameron] an even more dubious choice to be Britain's next prime minister than he was before and, should he attain that post, someone about whom the Obama administration ought to be very cautious.\" The Jewish Chronicle and the Guardian later also reported statements from an unnamed UK government official that US State Department officials had raised questions of the relationship in a meeting with the Home Office, a matter that US officials at the State Department denied, saying \"No. It was not raised.\"\n\nThe British Conservative Party was also accused of attempting to alter pages on Wikipedia \"to airbrush the embarrassing past\" by Edward McMillan-Scott, who also stated that his own article had been edited in this way. An article published in The Observer newspaper reports edits to the articles made on 25 June 2009 from an IP address originating in the United Kingdom House of Commons.\n\nOn 27 January 2011, Kamiński announced that he would resign as chairman of the ECR, citing \"aggression\" and \"hatred\" from his former colleagues in Poland's Law and Justice party. His resignation took effect on 8 March, and he was replaced by Jan Zahradil.\n\nHis views are described as \"Euro-sceptic, free-market and Atlanticist\" by Daniel Hannan MEP, who also described Kamiński as \"the closest thing to a British Tory outside the Carlton Club.\"\n\nKamiński has spoken of his support for the Treaty of Lisbon which he believes \"guarantees Poland's sovereignty\". He has also spoken in favour of the Common Agricultural Policy. Nevertheless, in his debut speech in the European Parliament as ECR chairman he called on the EU political leaders to respect the Irish \"no\" vote to the Lisbon Treaty.\n\nIn February 2018, the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that \"there were Jewish perpetrators\" of the Holocaust, \"not only German perpetrators.\" Kamiński said he hopes Morawiecki \"is being stupid and not ruthless.\" Prime Minister Morawiecki also paid respect to the Holy Cross Mountains Brigade, a right-wing Polish militia that, according to some historians, collaborated with Nazi Germany. Kamiński told \"The Jerusalem Post\" that the Holy Cross Mountains Brigade is \"the only possible part of Polish resistance who actively collaborated with Germans...and he is visiting their graves and I cannot understand it.\"\n\nIn March 2019, the low-circulation right-wing weekly \"Tylko Polska\" ran a headline \"How to spot a Jew\" on its front page alongside a picture of Jan Gross. When he saw the newspaper being sold in the Sejm, Kamiński said that it was an \"absolute scandal\" that \"filthy texts, as if taken from Nazi newspapers\" were sold at the parliament.\n\nIn his private life, Kamiński's passions include books, foreign languages as well as football. He lives in the Warsaw neighbourhood of Wawer.\n\n\n\n"}

He was born Robert Patrick O'Connor in Kilgore, Texas.\n\nO'Connor was born to migrant workers in Texas. Because his parents constantly moved around the southwestern United States looking for work, he never went to one school for a full year until his senior year of high school, in Roswell, New Mexico. Books, film, and radio were the only constants in his early life. His mother made sure he learned to read, and arranged for him to start school a year early. He lacked friendships due to the constant moving, and didn't do well in school. He dropped out of college after two years. He did not experience live theater, beyond a few school productions, until he was working one summer as a dishwasher at the Kennebunkport Playhouse in Kennebunkport, Maine and fell in love with the theater.\n\nHe stopped in New York City on his way back to Roswell from Maine and happened upon the Caffe Cino, the first Off-Off Broadway theatre, on September 14, 1961. He stayed in New York, working for free at the Caffe Cino, La Mama ETC, and other early Off-Off Broadway theaters in any capacity, and supported himself with temporary typing jobs while observing and participating in dozens of productions, including Lanford Wilson's \"So Long at the Fair\". He had already been writing poetry, and in 1964 wrote his first play, \"The Haunted Host\". The play was soon produced at Caffe Cino, and playwriting became his main focus.\n\nPatrick has written and published over sixty plays.\n\nHis first play, \"The Haunted Host\", premiered at Caffe Cino in 1964. Patrick denied Neil Flanagan, the Caffe Cino's star performer, the title role (because Flanagan had recently played Lanford Wilson's gay character, Lady Bright), and after other prominent Off-Off actors refused the role because they feared playing a gay character might damage their careers, Patrick appeared in the play himself alongside fellow playwright William M. Hoffman.\n\nHe also worked at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, another of the first Off-Off-Broadway theatres. Neil Flanagan directed a production of Patrick's play \"Mirage\" at La MaMa in July 1965. In November 1965, Patrick was production coordinator for \"BbAaNnGg\", a benefit to raise money for electrical work at La MaMa's 122 Second Avenue theatre, which included plays, spoken word, performance art, and film by many prominent Off-Off artists..\n\nIn 1969, he won the Show Business magazine Best Play Award for \"Joyce Dynel\", \"Salvation Army\", and \"Fog\". Also in 1969, his play \"Camera Obscura\" was produced on PBS, starring Marge Champion, and was chosen to be in the well-known playwright revue \"Collision Course\".\n\nPatrick was a prolific pioneer in Off-Off-Broadway and gay theatre, with over 300 productions of his plays during the 1960s in New York City alone. In 1972, the publisher and licensing company Samuel French called Patrick \"New York's Most-Produced Playwright\".\n\nPatrick directed a production of his own play, \"The Richest Girl in the World Finds Happiness\", at La MaMa in 1970. He directed his own plays, \"Valentine Rainbow\" at La MaMa and \"The Golden Circle\" at 119 Spring Street, both in 1972.\n\nHe directed holiday shows at La MaMa in 1971, 1972, and 1974. The 1971 production was called \"La MaMa Christmas Show\", the 1972 production was \"Play-by-Play\", and the 1974 production was \"Play-by-Play: A Spectacle of Ourselves\". In 1973, he directed Paul Foster's \"Silver Queen\", which featured music by John Braden, at La MaMa.\n\nIn 1973, Patrick's \"Kennedy's Children\" had an obscure opening in the back of a London pub theatre called the King's Head, in Islington. The production was instantly successful and was signed for the West End and other international productions. 1974 was the first season of gay theatre in the United Kingdom, to which Patrick contributed three plays. His play \"Cleaning House\" was produced in California during the summer of 1974.\n\nA 1974 Boston production of \"The Haunted Host\" was the first time Harvey Fierstein appeared on the professional stage as a man. Years later, Fierstein included a recording of Patrick's monologue \"Pouf Positive\" on his compact disc \"This Is Not Going to Be Pretty\". \"Pouf Positive\" was also filmed by Dov Hechtman in 1989.\n\nThe 1975 Broadway production of \"Kennedy's Children\" earned Shirley Knight a 1976 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play. She reprised her role in the 1979 CBS production of the play.\n\nPatrick traveled widely, from Anchorage to Cape Town, to see productions of \"Kennedy's Children.\" For ten years, he visited high schools and high school theatre conventions nationwide on behalf of the International Thespian Society.\n\nIn 1976, Marlo Thomas commissioned Patrick to write \"My Cup Ranneth Over\" for her and Lily Tomlin. Although they never performed in the play, it would become Patrick's most produced work.\n\nPatrick co-wrote \"Da Nutrcracker in Da Bronx\" with Jeannine O'Reilly and Paul Foster; the production was directed by Powell Shepard at La MaMa in 1977.\n\n\"T-Shirts\" was first produced in 1979, starring Jack Wrangler, and was later chosen as the opening piece in the anthology \"Gay Plays: A First Collection\".\n\nPatrick directed \"The Richest Girl in the World Finds Happiness\" at La MaMa again in 1981. His \"Blue Is For Boys\" was the first play about gay teenagers, and the Manhattan borough president declared a Blue is for Boys Weekend in honor of the play in 1983 and again in 1986. \"The Trial of Socrates\" was the first gay play presented by New York. \"Hello Bob\", an account of Patrick's experiences with the production of \"Kennedy's Children\", was the last play he directed before leaving New York for California.\n\nOther work by Patrick includes \"Untold Decades\" (1988), seven one-act plays giving a humorous history of gay life in the United States, and \"Temple Slave\", a novel about the early days of Off-Off-Broadway and gay theatre. Patrick has also ghostwritten several screenplays for film and television; contributed poems and reviews to \"Playbill\", \"FirstHand\", and \"Adult Video News\"; and had his short stories published in anthologies.\n\nPatrick has appeared in the documentaries \"Resident Alien\", with Quentin Crisp, and \"\", and in the videos \"O is for Orgy: The Sequel\" and \"O Boys: Parties, Porn, and Politics\", both produced by the O Boys Network.\n\nMost recently, he published his memoir \"Film Moi or Narcissus in the Dark\" and the plays \"Hollywood at Sunset\" and \"Michelangelo's Models\". He retired from theatre in 1990, and has lived in Los Angeles since 1993.\n\nIn 2010, he published a DVD of his lecture \"Caffe Cino: Birthplace of Gay Theatre\" and two books of poems, \"A Strain of Laughter\" and \"Bitter with the Sweet\", with Lulu.com. In 2013, he was brought back onto the stage by young Los Angeles underground theatre artists, appearing as a reader, singer, and actor. In March 2014, he gave a solo performance about his career entitled, \"What Doesn't Kill Me Makes a Great Story Later,\" which featured a capella renditions of many of his original songs This was followed by two more solo evenings of song, entitled \"Bob Capella\" and \"New Songs for Old Movies.\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was awarded one of the highest artistic accolades in Ireland, being elected a Saoi of Aosdána, before his death in 2000. His years in Nazi Germany led to a great deal of controversy.\n\nFrancis Stuart was born in Townsville, Queensland, Australia on 29 April 1902 to Irish Protestant parents, Henry Irwin Stuart and Elizabeth Barbara Isabel Montgomery; his father was an alcoholic and killed himself when Stuart was an infant. This prompted his mother to return to Ireland and Stuart's childhood was divided between his home in Ireland and Rugby School in England, where he boarded.\n\nIn 1920, at age 17, he became a Catholic and married Iseult Gonne, Maud Gonne's daughter. Maud Gonne's companion, Mary Barry O'Delaney, stood as his godmother upon his conversion. Aged 24 years, Iseult had had a romantic but unsettled life. Maud Gonne's estranged husband John MacBride was executed in 1916 for taking part in the Easter Rising. Iseult Gonne's father was the right-wing French politician, Lucien Millevoye, with whom Maud Gonne had had an affair between 1887 and 1899. Because of her complex family situation, Iseult was often passed off as Maud Gonne's niece in conservative circles in Ireland. Iseult grew up in Paris and London. She had been proposed to by W. B. Yeats in 1917 (he had also earlier proposed to her mother; Yeats was 50 at the time, Iseult 20) and had a brief affair with Ezra Pound prior to meeting Stuart. Pound and Stuart both believed in the primacy of the artist over the masses and were subsequently drawn to fascism; Stuart to Nazi Germany and Pound to Fascist Italy.\n\nGonne and Stuart had a baby daughter who died in infancy. Perhaps to recover from this tragedy, they travelled for a while in Europe but returned to Ireland as the Irish Civil War began. Unsurprisingly given Gonne's strong opinions, the couple were caught up on the anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army (IRA) side of this fight. Stuart was involved in gun running and was interned after a botched raid.\n\nAfter independence, Stuart participated in the literary life of Dublin and wrote poetry and novels. His novels were successful and his writing was publicly supported by Yeats. Yeats, however, seemed to have had mixed feelings for Stuart who was, after all, married to a woman he regarded almost as a daughter and, even, as a possible wife. In his poem \"Why should not Old Men be Mad?\" (1936) in which he lists what he regards as provocations to rage, he claims he has seen\nThe first of these lines is accepted as referring to Gonne and the second to Stuart (Elborn 1990).\n\nStuart and Gonne had three children, a daughter Dolores who died three months old, a son Ian and a daughter Katherine. Ian Stuart went on to become an artist and was married for a time to the sculptor Imogen Stuart and later to the Berlin-trained artist and jewellery designer Anna Stuart [7] whom he first met in 1970. They gave Stuart three grandchildren; food entrepreneur Laragh, photographer Suki and sculptress Sophia.\n\nStuart's time with Gonne may not have been an entirely happy time; from the accounts given in his apparently autobiographical novels, both he and his wife struggled with personal demons, and their internal anguish poisoned their marriage. In her letters to close friend William Butler Yeats, Iseult Gonne's mother Maud Gonne characterizes Francis Stuart as being emotionally, financially, and physically abusive towards Iseult: \"Stuart's conduct towards Iseult is shocking. While they were staying with me in Dublin he struck her & one day knocked her down. He threw her out of her own room with such violence that she fell on the landing half dressed at the feet of Claud Chevasse who was staying in the house at the time.\" Another time, neighbors reported seeing a fire in the couple's house: \"They found Iseult in her dressing gown outside. Stuart had locked himself in her room from where the flames were coming. They could see him pouring petroleum. Finally he opened the door -- he had been burning Iseult's clothes to punish her! Frequently he locked her up without food.\"\n\nIt was also during the 1930s that Stuart became friendly with German Intelligence (Abwehr) agent Helmut Clissmann and his Irish wife Elizabeth. Clissmann was working for the German Academic Exchange Service and the \"Deutsche Akademie\" (DA). He was facilitating academic exchanges between Ireland and the Third Reich but also forming connections which might be of benefit to German Intelligence. Clissmann was also a representative of the Nazi \"Auslandorganisation\" (AO) – the Nazi Party's foreign organisation – in pre-war Ireland.\n\nStuart was also friendly with the head of the German Legation in Dublin, Dr Eduard Hempel, largely as a result of Maud Gonne MacBride's rapport with him. By 1938 Stuart was seeking a way out of his marriage and the provincialism of Irish life. Iseult intervened with Clissmann to arrange for Stuart to travel to Germany to give a series of academic lectures in conjunction with the DA. Stuart travelled to Germany in April 1939 and his host in Germany was Professor Walter F. Schirmer, the senior member of the English faculty with the DA and Berlin University. He eventually visited Munich, Hamburg, Bonn and Cologne. At the completion of his lecture tour he accepted an appointment as lecturer in English and Irish literature at Berlin University to begin in 1940, two years after Jews had been barred from German universities by the Nazis' Nuremberg Laws.\n\nIn July 1939 Stuart returned home to Laragh and confirmed at the outbreak of war in September that he would still take the place in Berlin. When Stuart's plans for travelling to Germany were finalised, he received a visit from his brother-in-law, Seán MacBride, this meeting followed the seizure of an IRA radio transmitter on 29 December 1939, which had been used to contact Germany. Stuart, MacBride, Seamus O'Donovan, and IRA Chief of Staff Stephen Hayes then met at O'Donovan's house. Stuart was told to take a message to Abwehr HQ in Berlin. He travelled alone to Nazi Germany, something that was possible because Ireland was neutral in the Second World War, and arrived in Berlin during January 1940. Upon arrival he delivered the IRA message and had some discussion with the Abwehr on the conditions in Ireland and the fate of the IRA-Abwehr radio link. He also reactivated his acquaintance with Abwehr asset Helmut Clissmann who was acting as an advisor to SS Colonel Dr Edmund Vessenmayer. Through Clissmann Stuart was introduced to Sonderführer Kurt Haller. Around August 1940, Stuart was asked by Haller if he would participate in Operation Dove and he agreed although he was later dropped in favour of Frank Ryan. In so far as is known he had no further contact with German Intelligence although he did maintain links with Frank Ryan up to his death and funeral in June 1944.\n\nBetween March 1942 and January 1944 Stuart worked as part of the \"Redaktion-Irland\" (also sometimes referred to as \"Irland-Redaktion\", \"\"Editorial Ireland\"\" in English) team, reading radio broadcasts containing Nazi propaganda which were aimed at and heard in Ireland. Before deciding to accept this job he discussed it with Frank Ryan, and they agreed that no anti-Semitic or anti-Soviet statements should be made. He was dropped from the \"Redaktion-Irland\" team in January 1944 because he objected to the anti-Soviet material that was presented to him and deemed essential by his supervisors. His passport was taken from him by the Gestapo after this event.\n\nIn his radio broadcasts he frequently spoke with admiration of Hitler and expressed the hope that Germany would help unite Ireland. After the war he maintained that he was not drawn to Germany by support for Nazism, but that he was fascinated by wartime Germany as a dark spectacle of the grotesque and as a celebration of destruction. Stuart described one such event at the Berlin Olympic stadium in June 1939 as: \"A most amazing thing. Such a spectacle and organisation.\"\n\nStuart is known to have read only one piece of what might be considered anti-semitic propaganda for Redaktion-Irland: his first, and even then it was a single sentence. Whilst enthralled with the macabre spectacle of wartime Nazi Germany, he is also on record via his letters as deploring much of what he saw around him. \n\nHowever, Stuart did write the following in a 1924 IRA pamphlet (discovered by Brendan Barrington, see Bibliography):Austria, in 1921, had been ruined by the war, and was far, far poorer than Ireland is today, for besides having no money she was overburdened with innumerable debts. At that time Vienna was full of Jews, who controlled the banks and the factories and even a large part of the Government; the Austrians themselves seemed about to be driven out of their own city.In a lengthy article for the lrb Colm Tóibín wrote , \"Let us accept then that Stuart was anti-semitic, that he admired Hitler, that he was a rabid Irish nationalist.\" \n\nIn 1945 Stuart decided to return to Ireland with a former student, Gertrude Meissner; they were unable to do so and were arrested and detained by Allied troops. After they were released, Stuart and Meissner lived in Germany and then France and England. They married in 1954 after Iseult's death and in 1958 they returned to settle in Ireland. In 1971 Stuart published his best known work, \"Black List Section H\", an autobiographical fiction documenting his life and distinguished by a queasy sensitivity to moral complexity and moral ambiguity.\n\nIn 1991 he made an extended appearance on British television: on 16 March he took part in an \"After Dark\" discussion called \"The Luck of The Irish?\" alongside J. P. Donleavy, David Norris, Emily O'Reilly, Paul Hill and others.\n\nIn 1996 Stuart was elected a Saoi of Aosdána. This is a high honour in the Irish art world and the influential Irish language poet Máire Mhac an tSaoi objected strongly, referring to Stuart's actions during the war and claiming that he held anti-Semitic opinions. When it was put to a vote, she was the only person to vote for the motion (there were 70 against, with 14 abstentions). She resigned from Aosdána in protest, sacrificing a government stipend by doing so. While the Aosdána affair was ongoing, \"Irish Times\" columnist Kevin Myers attacked Stuart as a Nazi sympathiser; Stuart sued for libel and the case was settled out of court. The statement from the \"Irish Times\" read out in the High Court accepted \"that Mr Stuart never expressed anti-Semitism in his writings or otherwise\".\n\nFor some years before his death he lived in County Clare with his partner Fionuala and in County Wicklow with his son Ian and daughter-in-law Anna in a house outside Laragh village. Stuart died of natural causes on 2 February 2000 at the age of 97 in County Clare.\n\nStuart wrote many novels including \"Black List Section H\" (1971) , his most well-known work which is heavily autobiographical. Much of his writing is now out of print.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Welch is currently the president of the Europe, Africa & Middle East division of Bechtel.\n\nDavid Welch was born in Munich in 1953 to U.S. foreign service parents, and lived with them in Germany, Brazil, Morocco, Ecuador and Mexico. He studied at the London School of Economics (1973-4), and is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University (1975).\nWelch holds a graduate degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University. He speaks Spanish and Arabic.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1979, David Welch served in the Office of the Under Secretary for Security Assistance, Science and Technology. He was appointed political officer at the U.S. embassy in Islamabad (1979–81) and returned to the State Department where he was desk officer for Syria (1981) and Lebanon (1982-3).\n\nWelch was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Damascus as head of the political section (1984-6), and then to Amman (1986-8). From 1989 to 1991, he was a member of the National Security Council staff at the White House and became executive assistant to the Under Secretary for Political Affairs at the State Department (1991-2). He served as chargé d'affaires at the U.S. embassy in Riyadh (1992-4), continuing there as deputy chief of mission in 1995.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, Welch served in the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, playing an important role in achieving U.S. foreign policy objectives in Iran, Iraq and Libya. In October 1998, he became Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs implementing U.S. policy towards the United Nations and other international organizations.\n\nIn August 2001, David Welch was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Egypt (2001-5).\n\nOn March 18, 2005, Welch was sworn in as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs.\n\nOn December 18, 2008 Welch resigned from his position as the top U.S. diplomat in the Middle East to pursue work in the private sector. Sec. of State Condoleezza Rice bid Welch farewell in a speech that reviewed his service to the United States. Welch was the first US Assistant Secretary of State to resign in transition to the Obama administration. Welch is currently the president of the Europe, Africa & Middle East division of Bechtel.\n\nIn an article titled \"Time to Get the Facts Right,\" Welch criticized the Egyptian media, accusing it of \"recklessness in checking the facts of serious matters.\" In return, the Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ahmad Maher, said that the Egyptian press is worthy of respect and the attack on the Egyptian press did not correspond with the principles of democracy and freedom of opinion promoted by America. He added that the Egyptian press was expressing opinions independent of the government's policy. Welch later accused Egyptian journalists of lacking precision and professionalism, and of often fabricating and sensationalizing news. He specifically criticized Salama Ahmed Salama for speaking against human rights violations by Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nWelch also appeared on Egyptian television and confirmed that America would cut off its aid to Egypt because of the stand of the Egyptian judiciary toward the case of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an Egyptian scholar and political activist. He has also criticized a Friday sermon by the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, that described the Jews as the \"descendants of monkeys and pigs.\" Welch argued that it created a climate that is hostile to Jews and justifies terrorism. Welch had also sent a letter to the Minister of Culture requesting the safeguard of Jewish monuments after rumors spread that mosques would be built over those monuments.\n\nEgyptian intellectuals criticized him, accusing him of acting \"the American High Commissioner in Egypt,\" a reference to the authority that the British High Commissioner had once held during British occupation, as they considered his statements a severe interference in domestic issues.\n\nFollowing months of bilateral negotiations, the passage through Congress of the enabling legislation at the end of July 2008 and the signature of the Libyan Claims Resolution Act by President George W. Bush, the U.S.-Libya Comprehensive Claims Settlement Agreement was signed in Tripoli by David Welch on August 14, 2008.\n\nWelch described it as a very important agreement that turns a new page in the U.S.-Libya relationship, and said\n\nUnder this agreement each country's citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents. When fulfilled, the agreement will permit Libya and the US to develop their relations.\n\nHe estimated that the amount of compensation in question was $1.5 billion for the families of American victims of terrorism incidents of the 1980s that were blamed on Libya, and $300m for the Libyan families of victims of the U.S. bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986.\n\nIn October 2008 Libya proceeded to pay $1.5 billion into a fund which will be used to compensate relatives of the\n\nAs a result, President George W. Bush signed an executive order restoring the Libyan government's immunity from terror-related lawsuits and dismissing all of the pending compensation cases in the US, the White House said. \nAccording to Al Jazeera, papers found in the headquarters of the former intelligence agency of Libya indicate that during the 2011 Libyan civil war David Welch met officials of Muammar Gaddafi's regime on 2 August 2011, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Cairo a few blocks from the US embassy. Welch reputedly advised the Gaddafi regime on how to win the \"propaganda war\" by passing information on potential connections between anti-Gaddafi forces and terrorist organisations such as Al Qaeda to the American government via the intelligence agencies of other countries such as Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco. According to it he also recommended that the regime refers to the Syrian situation to expose what he viewed as a double standard in American foreign policy relating to the Arab Spring. He also criticised Qatar's role in the intervention, calling it a cynical effort to distract from the unrest in nearby Bahrain.\n\nDavid Welch also played a significant role in Morocco – United States relations particularly in regards to the ongoing conflict over Western Sahara. Speaking at a Congressional hearing for the House of Representatives in 2007, Welch articulated that the Department of State sided with Morocco on the issue of Western Sahara. He explained that the conflict is a, \"…destabilizing element [which] thwarts regional ties, which are necessary for economic expansion, and it has had an effect on government-to-government cooperation within the Maghreb.\" He then affirmed the State Department's role stating, \"We have welcomed Mr. Chairman, Morocco's recent initiative to resolve the dispute…. We consider the Moroccan proposal to provide real autonomy for the Western Sahara to be serious and credible.\" Conversely, in regards to the Polisario's proposal Welch stated, \"The Polisario proposal…does not seem, in our judgment, to contain new ideas…\"\n\n"}

He served as the head coach at the University of South Florida from the football program's inception in 1997 until 2009, compiling a record of 95–57.\n\nLeavitt grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida, and was a star quarterback for Dixie Hollins High School. After graduating from high school, Leavitt pursued studies at the University of Missouri, graduating in 1978. For the next two years, Leavitt worked as a graduate assistant. He then left for the University of Dubuque, where he spent two years as their football team's defensive coordinator. Following his years there, he went to Morningside College in 1982, spending one year as special teams coordinator before being promoted to defensive coordinator. After a brief stint at the University of Iowa where Leavitt pursued a doctorate degree in psychology, he followed Bill Snyder to Kansas State University in 1990. At Kansas State, Leavitt first spent one year as linebackers coach then five more as co-defensive coordinator, sharing the position with Bob Stoops. They led the Wildcats from relative obscurity to having a consistent, highly regarded defense.\n\nOn December 12, 1995, Leavitt was hired as head coach for the new football team at the University of South Florida. Leavitt signed his first class in 1996 for the first varsity season in 1997; all players redshirted in 1996. The South Florida Bulls football program began play as an independent at the NCAA Division I-AA (now FCS) level. After four seasons the program moved up to I-A (now FBS), also as an independent. After two years as a Division I-A independent, the Bulls joined Conference USA, but stayed for only two seasons. The Bulls landed in the Big East Conference prior to the start of the 2005 season. In December 2005, after the team's first season as members of the Big East, Leavitt led the Bulls to their 100th game and first ever bowl game at the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. One year later, Leavitt led the team to its first ever bowl win in the PapaJohns.com Bowl against the East Carolina Pirates in Birmingham, Alabama on December 23, 2006.\nEven before Leavitt led the Bulls to a bowl game, there was a rumor that he was heavily courted by the University of Alabama, where officials thought so highly of him that they sent him an offer and a contract to sign. He was also pursued by Kansas State after his mentor there, Bill Snyder, stepped down. On both occasions, Leavitt chose to stay with the program he had created. The success of South Florida's 2006 season spawned yet another round of interest in Leavitt's services, as his name was mentioned in national publications as a candidate to replace Larry Coker at the University of Miami and Mike Shula again at Alabama. Again, Leavitt expressed his desire and intent to stay with the program he established at South Florida and removed himself from consideration for those positions.\n\nOn September 16, 2007, Leavitt's Bulls team cracked the top 25 in both major polls, entering the AP Poll at #23 and the Coaches' Poll at #24, for the first time in the program's 11-year history. On September 28, Leavitt's Bulls stunned the #5 West Virginia Mountaineers at Raymond James Stadium for, perhaps, the biggest win thus far for the South Florida football program. South Florida's ascension into the top 25 from entry into I-A/FBS is the fastest in NCAA history, surpassing Boise State's rise by a mere seven weeks. The Bulls achieved another record on September 30 when they became the fastest program of the modern era to reach the top 10, landing at #6 in the AP Poll and #9 in the Coaches' Poll.\n\nOn October 14, South Florida received its first ever BCS ranking as the #2 team in the nation behind only the Ohio State Buckeyes. That week the team was also ranked #2 in the AP Poll and #3 in both the Coaches' and the Harris Interactive Poll. That ranking lasted only one week as the Bulls lost to Rutgers, 30–27, on October 18 in Piscataway, New Jersey.\n\nOn March 11, 2008, Leavitt signed a two-year extension to his original seven-year, $7 million contract that he signed in 2006. The new contract paid Leavitt $12.6 million for the 2008–14 seasons, with an annual starting salary of $1.5 million increasing by $100,000 each contract year.\n\nOn January 8, 2010, Leavitt was fired after an investigation by USF officials found that he had struck a player in the locker room during halftime of a game against Louisville the previous November 21. Leavitt claimed he was merely trying to console the player and never struck him. School officials found that Leavitt was not truthful about what happened, and also found that he had interfered with the investigation. ESPN's Ivan Maisel reported that Leavitt's interference, which included telling several players and coaches to change their stories, was the biggest factor in the decision to fire him. \"The Tampa Tribune\" reported that school president Judy Genshaft and athletic director Doug Woolard felt they had no choice but to fire Leavitt after he refused to admit he had done anything wrong. Running backs coach Carl Franks was named interim coach of the Bulls until January 14, 2010, when Skip Holtz was hired as head coach.\n\nOn January 2011, a settlement of $2.75 million was reached between USF and Jim Leavitt. The settlement includes $2 million for \"salary and benefits\" as well as a payment of $750,000 \"acknowledging Coach Leavitt's contributions to building USF's nationally respected football program.\" \n\nLeavitt was hired to his first National Football League (NFL) job by Jim Harbaugh to be the San Francisco 49ers linebackers coach for the 2011 season. Leavitt and other staffers were let go by the 49ers in January 2015 following Harbaugh's departure for the University of Michigan head coaching job.\n\nLeavitt was hired as defensive coordinator for the Colorado Buffaloes on February 5, 2015.\n\nLeavitt was hired as defensive coordinator for the Oregon Ducks on December 14, 2016. On February 13, 2019, he was fired.\n\nAfter serving as defensive analyst for Florida State during the 2019 season, he was hired as defensive coordinator at Florida Atlantic University In both jobs he was hired by Willie Taggart, who had also hired him as coordinator at Oregon.\n\n"}

{"id": "1803243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803243", "title": "Adonais", "text": "Adonais\n\nAdonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats, Author of Endymion, Hyperion, etc. () is a pastoral elegy written by Percy Bysshe Shelley for John Keats in 1821, and widely regarded as one of Shelley's best and most well-known works. The poem, which is in 495 lines in 55 Spenserian stanzas, was composed in the spring of 1821 immediately after 11 April, when Shelley heard of Keats' death (seven weeks earlier). It is a pastoral elegy, in the English tradition of John Milton's \"Lycidas\". Shelley had studied and translated classical elegies. The title of the poem is modelled on ancient works, such as \"Achilleis\" (a poem about Achilles), an epic poem by the 1st-century CE Roman poet, Statius, and refers to the untimely death of the Greek Adonis, a god of fertility. Some critics suggest that Shelley used Virgil's tenth Eclogue, in praise of Cornelius Gallus, as a model.\n\nIt was published by Charles Ollier in July 1821 (see 1821 in poetry) with a preface in which Shelley made the mistaken assertion that Keats had died from a rupture of the lung induced by rage at the unfairly harsh reviews of his verse in the \"Quarterly Review\" and other journals. He also thanked Joseph Severn for caring for Keats in Rome. This praise increased literary interest in Severn's works.\n\nShelley was introduced to Keats in Hampstead towards the end of 1816 by their mutual friend, Leigh Hunt, who was to transfer his enthusiasm from Keats to Shelley. Shelley's initial admiration of Keats was ambiguous: his reception to Keats' \"Endymion\" was largely unfavorable, while he found his later work, \"Hyperion\", to be the highest example of contemporary poetry. Keats found some of Shelley's advice patronising (the suggestion, for example, that Keats should not publish his early work). It is also possible that Keats resented Hunt's transferred allegiance. Despite this, the two poets exchanged letters after Shelley and his wife moved to Italy. When Keats fell ill, the Shelleys invited him to stay with them in Pisa, but Keats only made it as far as Rome, accompanied by the painter Severn. Shelley's concern for Keats's health remained undimmed, until he learned months after the fact that Keats had died in Rome, prompting the composition of \"Adonais\". Shelley said of Keats, after inviting him to stay with him in Pisa after the latter fell ill: \"I am aware indeed that I am nourishing a rival who will far surpass me and this is an additional motive & will be an added pleasure.\"\n\nShelley regarded \"Adonais\" as the \"least imperfect\" of his works. In a 5 June 1821 letter to John and Maria Gisborne, Shelley wrote about the work: \"It is a highly wrought \"piece of art\", perhaps better in point of composition than anything I have written.\"\n\nThe poet weeps for John Keats who is dead and who will be long mourned. He calls on Urania to mourn for Keats who died in Rome (sts. 1–VII). The poet summons the subject matter of Keats' poetry to weep for him. It comes and mourns at his bidding (sts. VIII–XV). Nature, celebrated by Keats in his poetry, mourns him. Spring, which brings nature to new life, cannot restore him (sts. XVI–XXI). Urania rises, goes to Keats' death chamber and laments that she cannot join him in death (sts. XXII–XXIX). Fellow poets mourn the death of Keats: Byron, Thomas Moore, Shelley, and Leigh Hunt (sts. XXX–XXXV). The anonymous \"Quarterly Review\" critic is blamed for Keats' death and chastised (sts. XXXVI–XXXVII).\n\nThe poet urges the mourners not to weep any longer. Keats has become a portion of the eternal and is free from the attacks of reviewers. He is not dead; it is the living who are dead. He has gone where \"envy and calumny and hate and pain\" cannot reach him. He is \"made one with Nature.\" His being has been withdrawn into the one Spirit which is responsible for all beauty. In eternity, other poets, among them Thomas Chatterton, Sir Philip Sidney, and the Roman poet Lucan, come to greet him (sts. XXXVIII–XLVI). Let anyone who still mourns Keats send his \"spirit's light\" beyond space and be filled with hope, or let him go to Rome where Keats is buried. Let him \"Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb. / What Adonais is, why fear we to become?\" He is with the unchanging Spirit, Intellectual Beauty, or Love in heaven. By comparison with the clear light of eternity, life is a stain (sts. XLVII–LII).\n\nThe poet tells himself he should now depart from life, which has nothing left to offer. The One, which is Light, Beauty, Benediction, and Love, now shines on him. He feels carried \"darkly, fearfully, afar\" to where the soul of Keats glows like a star, in the dwelling where those who will live forever are (sts. LIII–LV).\n\n\nAdonais begins with the announcement of his death and the mourning that followed: \"I weep for Adonais—he is dead!\" In Stanzas 2 through 35 a series of mourners lament the death of Adonais. The mother of Adonais, Urania, is invoked to arise to conduct the ceremony at his bier. The allusion is to Urania, the goddess of astronomy, and to the goddess Venus, who is also known as Venus Urania.\n\nThe over-riding theme is one of despair. Mourners are implored to \"weep for Adonais—he is dead!\" In Stanza 9 the \"flocks\" of the deceased appear, representing his dreams and inspirations. In Stanza 13, the personifications of the thoughts, emotions, attitudes, and skills of the deceased appear. In Stanza 22, Urania is awakened by the grief of Misery and the poet. The lament is invoked: \"He will awake no more, oh, never more!\" Urania pleads in vain for Adonais to awake and to arise.\n\nIn Stanzas 30 through 34, a series of human mourners appears. The \"Pilgrim of Eternity\" is Lord Byron, George Gordon, who had met and was a friend of Shelley's but who had never met Keats. The Irish poet Thomas Moore then appears who laments the sadness and loss that time causes. Shelley himself and Leigh Hunt are also part of the \"procession of mourners\". In Stanzas 31 through 34 the mourner is described as \"one frail Form\" who has \"fled astray\", \"his branded and ensanguined brow\" a brow \"like Cain's or Christ's\".\n\n\nThe sense of despair and hopelessness continues. In Stanza 37 the poet muses over a just punishment for the \"nameless worm\" and \"noteless blot\" who is the anonymous (now known to be John Wilson Croker, not the editor, William Gifford) and highly critical reviewer of Keats's \"Endymion\" (1818), who, in Shelley's opinion, traumatised John Keats, worsening his condition. The worst punishment that Shelley can contrive is that such a scoundrel should live: \"Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame!/ Live!\" Faced with the contradiction that he would wish a long life upon the miscreant who took his hero's life, in stanza 38 the poet bursts open the gates of consolation that are required of the pastoral elegy: \"Nor let us weep that our delight is fled/ Far from these carrion kites.\" In stanza 39, he uses the imagery of worms as symbolic of death: \"And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.\" In stanzas 45 and 46, Shelley laments that—like Thomas Chatterton, Sir Philip Sidney, and Lucan—Keats died young and did not live to develop as a poet . Keats transcends human life and has been unified with the immortal: \"He has outsoared the shadow of our night;/Envy and calumny and hate and pain,/ ... Can touch him not and torture not again... He is made one with Nature.\" Keats is as one with Nature, the Power, the One, and the one Spirit.\n\nAdonais \"is not dead .../ He hath awakened from the dream of life.\" \"Who mourns for Adonais?\" he asks in stanza 47. Shelley turns his grief from Adonais to \"we\" who must live on and \"decay/ Like corpses in a charnel,\" and after a series of stanzas (39–49) in which he celebrates the richer and fuller life that Adonais must now be experiencing, the poet becomes mindful that he is in Rome, itself a city rife with visible records of loss and decay. Moreover, he is in the Protestant cemetery there, where Shelley's three-year-old son is buried as well; and yet, as if mocking all despair, a \"light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread.\" Nature does not abhor death and decay, he sees; it is humans, who fear and hate in the midst of life, who do.\n\"What Adonais is, why fear we to become?\" he asks in stanza 51.\n\nIt is life's worldly cares—that obscuring and distracting \"dome of many-coloured glass\"—not Death that is the enemy and the source of human despair. \"Follow where all is fled,\" he urges, and he goads his own heart into having the courage to face not extinction but \"that Light whose smile kindles the Universe.\" The poem concludes by imagining Adonais to be a part of \"the white radiance of Eternity.\" At the end of the elegy, \"like a star,\" the soul of the dead poet \"Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.\"\n\nThe section on Rome (stanzas 48–52) is significant in the poem not only because Keats and Shelley's son are buried in the Protestant cemetery there but also because the section offers an alternative way of understanding themes already expressed in the poem. Beginning with a statement of alternativeness (\"Or go to Rome\"), the section provides an alternative way for the continuing mourner to imagine Adonais as part of the World Soul and so cease mourning. To imagine this by means of the conceptual exercise prescribed in stanza 47 may be too difficult for the mourner, who may not be able to imagine omnipresence—presence at the same time throughout the whole of space as well as at each individual point in space—but who would be able to imagine eternality—presence in the same place throughout the whole of time or of history. This latter concept is embodied in the idea of Rome as the \"Eternal\" city. Since both Rome and the particular cemetery symbolise (through the imagery used) the dominance of eternity, the mourner can doubly conceive of Keats as part of eternity—as absorbed into it and diffused throughout it—and thus conceive of him as part of the World Soul, among whose aspects is eternity as well as omnipresence.\n\nIn addition, the description of Keats's spirit as part of \"Eternal\" Rome shows parallels with the earlier description, in stanzas 44–46, of his spirit becoming part of the \"firmament\" of eternal stars which are the immortal spirits of great poets. And in stanza 52, as \"The One\" is to the \"many\" and \"heaven's light\" is to \"Earth's shadows\" and the \"white radiance of Eternity\" is to multicolored Life, so \"The glory\" of the World Soul is to aspects of Rome that represent death but symbolise eternity. By means of these parallels, the Rome section becomes fully integrated into the poem.\n\nMick Jagger of the Rolling Stones read a part of \"Adonais\" at the Brian Jones memorial concert at London's Hyde Park on 5 July 1969. Jones, founder and guitarist of the Stones, had drowned 3 July 1969 in his swimming pool. Before an audience estimated at 250,000 to 300,000, Jagger read the following verses from \"Adonais\":\n\n<poem>\nPeace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep\nHe hath awakened from the dream of life\n'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep\nWith phantoms an unprofitable strife,\nAnd in mad trance, strike with our spirit's knife\nInvulnerable nothings. — We decay\nLike corpses in a charnel; fear and grief\nConvulse us and consume us day by day,\nAnd cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.\n\nThe One remains, the many change and pass;\nHeaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;\nLife, like a dome of many-coloured glass,\nStains the white radiance of Eternity,\nUntil Death tramples it to fragments. — Die,\nIf thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!\nFollow where all is fled!\n</poem>\n\nActor Vincent Price read \"Adonais\" on a Caedmon Records recording which was released, originally in 1956, as an LP record and a cassette recording, Caedmon CPN 1059 and TC 1059. The recording was re-released in 1996.\n\nThe English rock band The Cure has recorded a song entitled \"Adonais\" based on the Shelley elegy as a B-side single and on the collection \"\" (2004). \"Adonais\" was originally the B-side to \"The 13th\", released in 1996.\n\nThe title of the \"\" episode \"Who Mourns for Adonais?\" (1967) is an allusion to the Shelley elegy, Stanza 47, line 415. A 2013 fan-produced sequel, \"Pilgrim of Eternity\", continued the allusion, by using the title given to Byron in the poem.\n\n\n"}

Mohammad Rauf; born June 4, 1969) is a Pakistani American who served for months as a double agent for the FBI before pleading guilty in May 2003 of providing material support to Al Qaeda. A United States citizen since 1999, he had worked as a truck driver and lived in Columbus, Ohio. As of September 2003, Faris is the \"only confessed al Qaeda sleeper caught on U.S. soil.\"\n\nFaris was detained in Ohio two weeks after Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was arrested in Pakistan on March 1, 2003. While installed as a double agent for the U.S. government, Faris sent messages to his terrorist commanders by mobile phone and email from an FBI safe house in Virginia. A senior Bush administration official said, \"He was sitting in the safe house making calls for us. It was a huge triumph.\"\n\nIyman Faris was born in 1969 in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. Faris came to the United States as a young man in 1994 on a student visa but never enrolled in school. In 1995, he married Geneva Bowling. Faris became a U.S. citizen in 1999.\n\nHe returned to Pakistan the following year, in 2000. His father had just died and his five-year marriage was ending. His ex-wife later said he had suffered from hearing imaginary voices and sudden bouts of believing that somebody was choking him.\n\nFaris admitted to having met Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. While in the region, Faris was asked to investigate the possibility of using an ultralight aircraft as an \"escape plane\" for bin Laden. He used an internet cafe in Karachi, Pakistan to research planes, buy cellphones and 2000 sleeping bags for training camps.\n\nWhile living in Ohio, Faris had been counseled by a local imam for thoughts of suicide. After threatening to jump off a bridge, he was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation. Faris' five-year marriage ended in 2000.\n\nIn late 2001, while in Pakistan, Faris went to a travel agency to have some expired airline tickets to Yemen re-issued for several unknown colleagues. He claimed to be a preacher from Tablighi Jamaat, a missionary group.\n\nIn early 2002, Faris was introduced to an operative identified only as \"C-2\". He learned of a plot allegedly involving the simultaneous destruction of the Brooklyn Bridge by cutting through cables with blowtorches, and a second group that would derail a train in Washington D.C. Faris' investigations into obtaining the necessary tools for the dual-operation involved asking a friend where he might purchase welding equipment, and researching the structure of the bridge on the internet. He concluded that the operation was unlikely, and allegedly sent a message back to Pakistan calling off the plot, stating that \"The weather is too hot\".\n\nOn March 19, 2003, Faris was visited by two FBI agents and an anti-terror officer, who confronted him with testimony from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed about his contacts with al-Qaeda, and the results of an intercepted telephone call. Faris was reportedly accommodating, and agreed to let the agents search his apartment the following day.\n\nConfronted by the FBI in April, Faris confessed. He agreed to cooperate with the FBI and work as a double agent, reporting to them. He was ordered to leave his home in Columbus and was assigned to a safe house in Virginia, from which he would appear to continue discussions with his contacts, reporting the information back to the FBI.\n\nDuring this period, Faris told the agents that Majid Khan, a Baltimore youth who worked at his father's gas station, had referred to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as an \"uncle\" and spoken of a desire to kill Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf. He later totally recanted this in a written statement provided in 2007 to Khan's Combatant Status Review Tribunal, saying his accusation was \"an absolute lie,\" and he had been coerced into making the claims.\n\nThe United States took Khan into custody in Pakistan and sent him to a CIA black site in Afghanistan, where he was interrogated, allegedly tortured and held for several years. In September 2006, he was transferred to military custody at Guantanamo Bay as a high-value detainee.\n\nThe Department of Justice charged Faris in federal court with terrorism charges. On May 1, 2003, in a plea bargain, Faris pleaded guilty to both charges: providing material support and resources to Al Qaeda and conspiracy for providing the terrorist organization with information about possible U.S. targets for attack. The documents relating to the charges were not unsealed until June 19, 2003. Shortly after, the Department of Justice announced that it had used Faris as a double agent, who had worked under orders from the FBI. Faris is the \"only confessed al Qaeda sleeper caught on U.S. soil.\"\n\nOn September 25, 2003, Faris sought to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that while he admitted to meeting with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, he had been seeking information about al-Qaeda for a book he wanted to write. He argued that Mohammed had given false information to authorities as revenge, for Faris had refused to be recruited into al-Qaeda by his lieutenant. The appeal was rejected. On October 28, 2003, Faris was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment by District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema.\n\nAccording to the \"New York Times\", the Brooklyn Bridge plot was uncovered with assistance from the NSA eavesdropping program. The \"Times\" delayed publishing the story for a year ostensibly at the request of the government. The story was one of several that appeared in December 2005 by Eric Lichtblau and James Risen that won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting awarded by Columbia University.\n\nFaris' new lawyer, David B. Smith, announced that he was looking into a lawsuit against George W. Bush, who personally authorized the wiretaps.\n\nIn 2004, the Department of Justice charged Nuradin Abdi in a bomb plot. It reported that Abdi had said that Faris had picked him up from the Columbus airport.\n\n"}

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that \"these fraudulent schemes involve the purported issuance, trading, or use of so-called 'prime' bank, 'prime' European bank or 'prime' world bank financial instruments, or other 'high yield investment programs.' (HYIP's) The fraud artists … seek to mislead investors by suggesting that well regarded and financially sound institutions participate in these bogus programs.\" In 2010, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) warned that \"[t]he con artists behind HYIPs are experts at using social media — including YouTube, Twitter and Facebook — to lure investors and create the illusion of social consensus that these investments are legitimate.\"\n\nThough Ponzi schemes have existed since at least the early 1900s, the rise of digital payment systems has made it much easier for operators of such websites to accept payments from people worldwide. Electronic money systems are generally accepted by HYIP operators because they are more accessible to operators than traditional merchant accounts. Some HYIP operators opened their own digital currency companies that eventually folded; these companies include Standard Reserve, OSGold, INTGold, EvoCash, and V-Money. StormPay started in the same way in 2002, but it remained in business even after the HYIP that it was created to serve was shut down by the State of Tennessee.\n\nSome HYIPs have incorporated in countries with lax fraud laws to secure immunity from investor laws in other countries. The operators have been known to host their website with a web host that offers \"anonymous hosting\". They use this website to accept transactions from participants in the scheme.\n\nSome investors try to make money by attempting to invest in HYIPs at an early enough stage to create a return, and then by cashing out before the scheme collapses to profit at the expense of the later entrants. This is in itself a gamble as poor timing may result in a total loss of all money invested. To reduce this risk some of these investors use \"tracker sites\" listing the schemes and their current state. One expert states that there is not enough evidence to corroborate that tracker sites can actually help investors make more money.\n\nOn August 17, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against defendants Paul Burks and Zeek Rewards, based in North Carolina. Paul Burks ran Zeek Rewards, an \"investment opportunity\" that promised investors returns by sharing in the profits of Zeekler, a penny auction website. Money invested in Zeek Rewards earned returns of 1.5% per day. Investors were encouraged to let their gains compound and to recruit new members into a \"forced matrix\" to increase their returns. The SEC contends that this forced matrix payout scheme constitutes a pyramid scheme. New investors had to pay a monthly subscription fee of between US$10 and US$99, and provide an initial investment of up to $10,000. The higher the initial investment, the higher the returns appeared. The SEC stated that the Zeekler website brought in only about 1% of the Zeek Rewards company's purported income and that the vast majority of disbursed funds were paid from new investments. The SEC alleges that Zeek Rewards is a $600 million Ponzi scheme affecting 1 million investors, which would be one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history by number of affected investors. A court-appointed receiver estimated that the $600 million amount could be \"on the low end\" and that the number of investors could be as many as 2 million. Paul Burks paid $4 million to the SEC and agreed to cooperate with its investigation. In February 2017 Burks was sentenced to 14 years and 8 months' imprisonment for his part in Zeek Rewards.\n\nOSGold was founded as an e-gold imitator in 2001 by David Reed and folded in 2002. According to a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in early 2005, the operators of OSGold may have made off with US$250 million. CNet reported that \"at the height of its popularity, the OSGold currency boasted more than 60,000 accounts created by people drawn to promises of 'high yield' investments that would provide guaranteed monthly returns of 30 percent to 45 percent.\"\n\nPIPS (People in Profit System or Pure Investors) was started by Bryan Marsden in early 2004 and spanned more than 20 countries. PIPS was investigated by Bank Negara Malaysia in 2005 which resulted in Marsden and his wife being charged in a Malaysian court with 97 counts of money laundering more than 77 million RM, equivalent to $20 million.\n\nAnother large case took place in Thailand in 2008. Colonyinvest cheated 50,000 Thai investors out of about 5 billion baht (~ 150 million US$).\n\nOther HYIPs that have been shut down due to legal action includes Ginsystem Inc, the infamous Sunshine Empire in Singapore, City Limouzine, Future Maker Pvt. Ltd. (~200 million US$) in India, EMGOLDEX or Emirates Gold Exchange, and WorldWide Solutionz in South Africa.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1803258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803258", "title": "Reach for the Stars (video game)", "text": "Reach for the Stars (video game)\n\nReach for the Stars is a science fiction strategy video game. It is the earliest known commercially published example of the 4X genre. It was written by Roger Keating and Ian Trout of SSG of Australia and published in 1983 for the Commodore 64 and then the Apple II in 1985. Version 3 added an MS-DOS port, though it did not share all of the features of the other platforms. The game was eventually ported to pre-Mac OS X versions of the Macintosh operating system, such as System 6. It was also ported to the Amiga and Apple II, from the Mac OS version.\n\nThe player commands a home star in the galaxy, and then expands to form an interstellar empire by colonizing far-off worlds, building powerful starships, and researching new technologies.\n\n\"Reach for the Stars\" was very strongly influenced by the board game \"Stellar Conquest\". Many of \"RFTS\"'s features have direct correspondence in \"Stellar Conquest\".\n\nGraphics are minimal, yet the tactical and strategic elements provide countless rich combinations for colony development and interstellar warfare. The software's AI also offered a challenging opponent in single-player games. It is not uncommon for a \"Reach for the Stars\" game to take over twelve hours to complete in single-player mode and 24 hours with multiple players.\n\nIn Versions 1 to 3 the player starts off with one planet that has Level 1 technology and a middle level environment. Three types of ships are available:\n\n\nStarting players have limited funds, and have to decide where to invest the funds (technology upgrades, ships, or environmental upgrades). Upgrading a world's planetary environment, for example, means that its population grows more quickly, improving production; this is a mixed blessing, however, because if the population grows beyond the maximum allowed for that planet, the costs to feed the population skyrocket. Building a lot of ships early can win a player the game, if the player finds his enemies' home planets before they manage to upgrade their military technology; on the other hand, it can lead to a loss if the player's opponents upgrade first and attack with superior ships.\n\nEach turn is divided into two sections - a development phase, and a movement phase. In the development phase, players work on planetary production, deciding what each planet will produce that turn. In the movement phase, players have the option to send ships to other star systems to explore, colonize, or conquer.\n\nBecause the game evolves along so many different axes of possibility, the game offers tremendous replay value. It is quite possible to save a game on the first turn, and have it play out differently each time it is restored.\n\nA bug causes human players that do nothing to become wealthy while computer opponents fight each other. The designers added a feature that causes the computer opponents to attack the human at 20,000 credits.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" in 1983 found \"Reach for the Stars\" quite user-friendly and enjoyable, with the single flaw of a lack of notification of natural disasters, which could not fit onto the disk space available. The computer AI and customization of each game were particular highlights of the review. In a 1992 survey of science fiction games the magazine gave the title five of five stars, praising it as \"Arguably the best science fiction game ever released ... a product still worth playing\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game four stars out of five, stating that \"A worthy update would no doubt raise this game again to 5-star status\". \"Compute!\" in 1986 called the game \"a particularly fine simulation of galactic exploration, combat, and conquest\", noting that players needed to balance several different priorities to succeed. It concluded that \"Reach for the Stars\" was \"one of the better games on the market this year\". \"inCider\" in 1986 gave the Apple II version three stars (\"Above average\") out of four, stating that while the game was \"exciting\", \"[i]t's unromantic to say that much of the rest of the game is a matter of juggling numbers, but that's the truth\". Jerry Pournelle of \"BYTE\" stated in 1989 that the Mac version of \"Reach for the Stars\" was \"certainly the best implemented\" version of \"Stellar Conquest\". The game was reviewed in 1994 in \"Dragon\" #211 by Jay & Dee in the \"Eye of the Monitor\" column. Jay did not rate the game, but Dee gave the game 3½ out of 5 stars.\n\nNorman Banduch reviewed \"Reach for the Stars\" in \"Space Gamer\" No. 69. Banduch commented that \"\"Reach For The Stars\" is a most addictive game. After player 10 to 15 hours a week for several months I still find it hard to save the game and go home. It offers a wide variety of set-up conditions and victory conditions, and play is never the same. The computer is a tough foe. Even after the is mastered, there are enough options and random variables to keep it from going stale. I cannot recommend it enough.\"\n\nBob Ewald reviewed \"Reach for the Stars\" in \"Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer\" No. 77. Ewald commented that \"All things considered, I really enjoyed the game. I feel parts of the combat system are illogical, but the game as a whole is great.\"\n\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"Reach for the Stars\" the 51st-best computer game ever released.\n\nA sequel to \"Reach for the Stars\" re-written for the Windows platform was released on September 14, 2000 by developer Strategic Studies Group and publisher Strategic Simulations, Inc. In 2005 Matrix Games working alongside Strategic Studies Group, updated the 2000 release; this updated version was released in 2005.\n\nA series of books was written in 2018 by the game company Greentwip, called Interstellar, Anatomy and The Garlan Wars, while its publication is still ongoing it is being said that a TV channel would produce cinematographic films out of the books, this happened after Greentwip's founder got deep into the story and proposed to give a better and linear approach to all the species that the game aims to deliver to the player in order to become a better \"pure Sci-Fi\" experience.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1803281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803281", "title": "Pitch (card game)", "text": "Pitch (card game)\n\nPitch (or \"High Low Jack\") is an American trick-taking card game derived from the English game of All Fours (Seven Up). Historically, Pitch started as \"Blind All Fours\", a very simple All Fours variant that is still played in England as a pub game. The modern game involving a bidding phase and setting back a party's score if the bid is not reached came up in the middle of the 19th century and is more precisely known as Auction Pitch or Setback.\nWhereas All Fours started as a two-player game, Pitch is most popular for three to five players. Four can play individually or in fixed partnerships, depending in part on regional preferences. Auction Pitch is played in numerous variations that vary the deck used, provide methods for improving players hands, or expand the scoring system. Some of these variants gave rise to a new game known as Pedro or Cinch.\n\nTwo or more players play individually or in equal-sized teams, seated alternatingly. Normal play rotation is clockwise. Players cut for first deal. Cards rank as in Whist and have certain numerical values called \"pips\" as shown in the table. In each deal up to 4 scoring points are distributed among the parties. The game is won by the party that first reaches a previously specified target score over several deals.\n\nThe dealer shuffles and the pone cuts. The dealer hands out 6 cards to each player in batches of 3. Trump is determined by the suit of the first card played in trick-play. Eldest hand leads to the first trick, and the winner of each trick leads to the next. Standard trick-play rules are in effect with the exception that a player who can follow suit to a plain suit lead is nevertheless allowed to play a trump.\n\nAt the end of the deal, scoring points, also referred to as pointy points in some circles, are awarded as described in the table. The Jack point is not awarded if no player held the Jack of trumps. The Game point is only awarded if one party has won more pips in tricks than any other. The scoring points accrue strictly in the order given in the table, preventing ties in case more than one team reaches the target score at the end of the deal.\n\nThe pub game played nowadays in northern England under the name \"All Fours\" is a four-player partnership version of Pitch, played for 11 points. Side payments are made for winning all four points in a single hand. In some areas the point for \"Low\" is awarded to the eventual owner.\n\nChoosing the trump suit by leading to the first trick is known as \"pitching\". That trump is determined by pitching rather than by turning up a card from the stock is the key difference between Pitch and classical All Fours/Seven Up.\n\nAuction Pitch is played in exactly the same way as simple Pitch, except that instead of eldest hand the highest bidder pitches, and the highest bidder must reach the number of scoring points bid or is set back.\n\nBeginning with eldest hand, each player gets one chance to bid for the privilege of declaring the trump suit. A bid is the number of points that the bidder undertakes to win in the deal, the minimum bid being 1. Each player must make a higher bid than the previous player, or pass. A bid of four (the highest possible) is known as \"shoot the moon\", \"slam\" or \"smudge\".\nIf no player bids, the deal is abandoned and the same dealer deals again.\nThe player who wins the bid, known as the \"pitcher\" or \"maker\", must win as many points as he or she bid. The pitcher \"pitches\", i.e. leads to the first trick and thereby establishes the trump suit (as the suit of the card led).\n\nA player who can follow suit but discards a card of a different non-trump suit is punished for the revoke by being set back by the value of the bid.\n\nPlayers may receive points even if they did not win the auction. A pitcher who did not win at least the number of points undertaken with the bid does not receive any of the points, and is instead \"set back\" by the amount of the bid. Negative scores are possible.\n\nIt may happen that at the end of a deal more than one player reaches the number of points necessary to win the game. In this case the order in which the points are rewarded becomes crucial: Any points won by the pitcher are counted first. Thereafter the remaining points are awarded in the order as listed above, i.e. first High, then Low, then Jack, then Game.\n\nScores can be kept on paper, in which case negative numbers may be marked by circles. (A player with a negative score is said to be \"in the hole\".) Alternatively, each player may begin with as many counters as are needed to win the game, and get rid of one for each point won.\n\nAll Fours and its variants have always been used as gambling games, and according to John McLeod, cutthroat Pitch is probably still popular for this purpose at the American coasts.\nIf the game is played with a pool, each player initially pays a fixed amount into the pool. A player who is set back for failing to win as many points as bid for, or for a revoke, also has to pay the same amount into the pool. The winner of the game receives the contents of the pool.\n\n\nMost forms of the game have a partnership variant for four players in two teams, sitting crosswise. (Three teams of two players or two teams of three players can play by the same principle.) Scoring works as in basic pitch, but by team. It is sufficient for the pitcher's team to score the number of points indicated by the bid. The partnership game is typically played for a higher number of points, e.g. 21 points.\n\nWinning all four points is much easier in the four-player partnership version than in other versions. Therefore, one common variation is that \"shooting the moon\" is a separate bid worth 5 points and involves winning all six tricks in addition to winning all four points. The fifth point for winning all six tricks is only awarded if the pitching team undertook to shoot the moon.\n\nAnother variation common in partnership Pitch is that only the pitching party can win the game.\n\nIn some variants a Joker is added to the pack as an additional trump ranked below the Two of trumps. For the determination of the Low point it is ignored, but its owner or winner is awarded an additional Joker point.\n\nA Joker may also be added to the pack as the ultimate trump, capturing everything but the Low trump. It also represents a point.\n\nIn Euchre, the non-trump Jack of the same color (not suit) as trumps is called the \"Left Bower\". It belongs logically to the trump suit and ranks immediately below the Jack of trumps (\"Right Bower\"). Some variants of Pitch borrow this feature, in which case the Left Bower is referred to as the \"Off-Jack\" or \"Jick\". If this feature is used, an additional point for Off-Jack can be scored in analogy to the point for Jack.\n\nA Joker can be used for the same purpose, i.e. ranking between the Jack of trumps and the Ten of trumps. Combining the last two ideas, one can rank the Joker between the Off-Jack and the Ten of trumps. Finally, one can play with the Off-Jack and more than one Joker, see Smear for details.\n\nSome variants have \"Odd Trumps\". For example, the Five of trumps might be worth 5 points (\"Chicago Pitch\") or the Three of trumps 3 points. In analogy to the Off-Jack there may also be other Off-trumps which are logically trumps and rank immediately below their trump counterparts. For example, the Off-Three might be worth 3 points while the Three of trumps retains its usual worth of 0 points.\n\nMost variation in Pitch centers around a multitude of scoring systems. While many different points are possible in pitch, no variant offers the ability to earn every type of point. Instead, most variants use a selection of the points listed below.\n\nVarious variations deal with ways of improving players' hands. Some address the case that one player has exceptionally poor cards:\n\nIn some variations, the highest bidder does not pitch immediately, but first announces the trump suit, after which all players get a chance to discard a number of cards. Their hands are afterwards completed to six cards by the dealer. Each player \n\nIn some variations a \"widow\" (extra hand) is dealt along with the players' hands. Before deciding the trump suit, the maker adds the widow to his or her hand and brings the number of cards back down to six by discarding.\n\nThe players may initially be dealt more than six card (typically nine). After the highest bidder has announced the trump suit, each player \nafter which the dealer completes each hand to six cards. \nIn some variations the highest bidder has the privilege of completing his or her hand by searching the remaining stock after all other players have received their cards.\n\nAs a simpler alternative, each player brings his or her down to six by discarding the appropriate number of cards. The discarded cards must all be non-trumps or include all of the player's non-trumps.\n\nA player should try to determine what points his hand will allow the player to win and bid accordingly. The rule of thumb is to add one point to a bid when you have a partner.\n\nTypical strategy is to \"draw out\" valuable cards from other players. Since pitch rules require that players follow suit, it is possible to force the play of Jacks and Jokers, allowing their capture. If the bid-winning player cannot be sure he or she has the highest trump, lower trumps may initially be led to draw them out; the hope is that by the second or third trick only Jacks and Jokers will remain in other players' hands - they can then be captured.\n\nIf the player on your left is particularly easy to read as having a good hand, then you may enter a bid even with a worthless hand in hopes to make your mark overbid.\n\nIn all varieties of pitch, the goal is to set the player or team who wins the bid. In practice, this might mean giving an opponent a point card just to deny it to the bidder. This also means \"sloughing game\" (cards with a point value) to a single player so that the bidder will not win the \"Game\" point.\n\nBarn Pitch is the most common variant of Pitch that requires trump to be \"broken\" before any trump can be played. Instead of leading with trump, the highest bidder must instead lead with a different suit. Trump is then only allowed to be played if a player cannot follow the led suit, once the first trump of the round is played then trump is broken. Once trump has been broken, or it is the only suit remaining in a players hand, it can be led. Gameplay and scoring after the trump is broken proceed exactly as it is in classic Pitch.\n\nAbacos Pitch is a Pitch variant that is gaining popularity in the mid-Atlantic and northeast United States. It varies from classic Pitch as follows: In the bidding round, each player may choose to look or not look at his/her hand before making a decision. At the end of the bidding round, each player who looked at his/her cards before acting loses one card, chosen at random. Players who lose a card have nothing to play in the sixth and final round of gameplay. Gameplay and scoring after the bidding round proceed exactly as in classic Pitch.\n\nMan-O-War Pitch is another variant of classic Pitch. It is similar to Abacos Pitch except after the bidding round, the player who made the highest bid looks at the cards given up by players who looked at their hand prior to bidding, one at a time. The player with the highest bid may choose to take or not take each card he looks at. If he chooses to take a card, he discards a card of his choice. This variant provides a significant advantage to the player with the highest bid and therefore promotes aggressive bidding.\n\nContway 6-point pitch is based on auction pitch and combines a number of variations, some of which are unique. The deck is played with a regular 52-card deck plus one joker. The six points consist of High, Low, Jack, Off-Jack, Joker, and Game. Trump suit includes the Off-Jack and Joker and is ordered Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Off-Jack, Joker, 10,9,8...2.\n\nFour people play in teams of two with partners sitting across from each other. If multiple games are played, partners rotate so all possibilities for partners are fulfilled. Partnering in large groups or multiple tables is done casually using the best guess of the group for the proper partnerships. Overall wins are not partner based, but individual and the person with the most wins after all play has ended is considered the winner. Three people can play with the same rules but there are no teams.\n\nEach player is dealt six cards in two rounds of three cards starting left of the dealer. The player to the left of the dealer is the first to bid, and continues clockwise. Each player has the option to either pass or outbid the previous bid. The minimum bid is 2, and if all players pass, the dealer is given the minimum bid and becomes the winning bidder.\n\nAfter every player has bid, the winning bidder then announces the trump suit. Starting left of the dealer, each player has a chance to throw away any cards, including trump, and is dealt to a total of six cards. If all six cards are thrown, it is called being \"pitched\". The unused and discarded cards are then placed to the left of the dealer to denote the next dealer and the deal moves clockwise around the table.\n\nThe first card is played by the winning bidder and must be trump. Players must always follow suit, but trump can be played at any time. \nCards are discarded face up into one pile for each team. Either pile can be examined by any player at any time. This helps the forgetful but also provides a way to actively tally for Game, the sixth point.\n\nThe bidder and only the bidder has the option to fold the game at any time even before the first hand is played and is equivalent to not making the bid. If cards are in play, the hand must be completed before stopping. Points for High, Low, Jack, Off-Jack and Joker are awarded to the non-bidding team only if the cards have been successfully played before the game was folded. However, the High and Low points must be the Ace and the 2 even if revealing all cards shows other cards would have won High or Low. Game point is not counted.\n\nUnique to Contway 6-point pitch is the ability to toss trump cards before the redeal. Tossing point cards such as the Jack, Off-Jack, or Joker can useful if the other team bids too high, or when it is the only trump in the hand and the other team keeps many cards which decreases the chance that the redeal will provide protection. Actively watching the number of cards withheld by each player is informative.\n\nThe general strategy during the game revolves around taking the Jack, Off-Jack and Joker. Leading the highest trump allows the partner to safely give the team a point card, or will potentially force an opponent to give a point card. Since one can trump at any time, playing last in a hand provides the easiest way to win one of these cards. Game point is fought for actively during the game, and if a teammate is playing last, one will often \"Alley-oop\" a face card or a 10 to add to the team's Game tally.\n\nOnce all cards are played, the two piles are examined to determine points. The High and the Low, each worth one point, are the highest and lowest trump played during the round. As some cards are never in play, the Ace and 2 of trump are not always high and low. Low is awarded to the team who played the card, not who won the card. It is therefore customary to say \"2 for low\" or \"3 for low\" when a low card is played to help recall who threw the card. The Jack, Off-Jack, and Joker, collectively called \"The Jacks\", are each worth one point, and counted for the team who won them.\n\nEach team does a tally for Game point with the winner having the most points in their pile. Both face cards and 10's of any suit are counted for points according to the following point system: 10= 10 points, Ace= 4 points, King= 3 points, Queen= 2 points, Jack= 1 point. In the event of a tie, the Joker acts as the winning tie-breaker. If there is no Joker in play, no game point is awarded for the tie.\n\nIf the bidding team makes less than their bid, they are set, or \"hickeyed\", and subtract the bid from their overall score. A star is placed next to the current score to denote a hickey. Scores never go below zero. Play continues until a team reaches 11 points. In the event that both teams have 11 or more points, the bidding team of the final round wins even if the non-bidding team has more points.\n\nA separate list is maintained for keeping track of overall wins and losses of each player individually. Each winning player earns +$1.00 (or +1 if playing points only) and each losing player -$1.00. If the winning team had hickeys, these are not penalized. However, if the losing team had hickeys, each losing player loses another $1.00 per hickey, and each winning player gains $1.00. In this way, the total for the entire list should always equal zero. At the end of all play, for example at the end of a week long vacation, a winner is declared and everyone is paid out.\n\nEach player is dealt six cards. Bids are usually from 1-9, and the \"Shoot the Moon\" rule is in effect. After bidding, players discard non-trumps and the dealer distributes cards so that each hand has six cards. Points available are High 'Ace' (one point), Low 'Two' (one point), Jack (one point), Off-Jack or Jick 'Jack of same color different suit' (one point), Big Joker (one point), Little Joker (one point), Three (three points), Game '10' (one point), and sometimes Off-Three (three points). King and Queen are not counted toward the game points but still take Jack, Off-Jack, both Jokers, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, both Threes, and Two.\n\nThis variant allows players to bid a \"straight\" hand (like normal) or to double bid. For example, a player may bid a \"straight 6\", or \"6 for 12.\" In the latter example, the player would score 12 points by earning six; or, failing to earn points equal to his or her bid, would be \"set\" 12 points.\n\nPlayed like \"Oklahoma Ten-Point\" with a few variations. Each player is initially dealt nine cards. Minimum bid is 5, and the \"Shoot the Moon\" rule is in effect. Players discard all non-trumps and the dealer distributes remaining undealt cards so all players have six. Points available are Ace, Jack, Off-Jack, \"High\" Joker, \"Low\" Joker, Ten, Three (worth three points), and Two (an automatic point for the player).\n\nThis variant uses the \"Force Bid\" rule. However, \"Mucking a Hand\" and \"Misdeal\" are prohibited.\n\nThe deck consists of a traditional 52-card deck with both Jokers included, making a 54-card deck.\n\nAce is always high and the highest playable card, but is not the most valuable. The Off-Jack is the non-trump Jack of the same color. For instance, if the trump suit is Spades, the Off-Jack would be the Jack of Clubs, Jack of Clubs will therefore be a Spade instead of a Club.\n\nThe Three is among the lowest-ranked cards, but is the most valuable as it is worth three points. The Two is an automatic point, as the player of the Two always keeps it.\n\nTeams are chosen randomly by having each player draw a single card from a facedown deck. The two highest cards and the two lowest cards become teammates and sit crosswise from each other.\n\nEach player is dealt nine cards. The player to the left of the dealer is the first to bid, and continues in a clockwise pattern. Each player has the option to either pass or outbid the previous bid. The minimum bid is 5, and the \"Shoot the Moon\" rule is in effect. If all players pass, the dealer is stuck with the bid.\n\nAfter every player has bid, the winning bidder then announces the trump suit. Every player, other than the winning bidder, then discards any non-trumps. The dealer then re-deals to each player so that they each player has a total of six cards. The winning bidder is then granted what's left of the deck. This is known as the widow.\n\nAfter the winning bidder picks out all trumps from the widow, he must narrow (or widen) his hand to six cards. If he has more than six trump cards, he must \"burn\" a trump. When burning a trump, the player must announce what card he is burning to the table. All non-pointer trumps must be burned before any pointers can be burned.\n\nThe winning bidder is the first to play, and continues in a clockwise pattern. The first hand must be in the trump suit (\"Leading Off\" is not allowed on the first hand). If the lead player plays a trump, every player must play a trump on that particular hand. The player who plays the highest trump card takes the hand. The winner of the previous hand is the first to play the next hand.\n\nOnce a player has no more trumps in their hand, they are up (out of that game). You are not allowed to declare that you are up until it is your turn.\n\nOther than the first hand, a player can choose to lead a non-trump. If a player leads off, all cards become playable. Once again, the highest trump card wins the hand. If no trump cards are played during an off lead, the winner of the previous hand leads the next hand, regardless of what non-trump is played.\n\nThe objective of the hand for the team with the winning bid is to (at least) match what they bid. The objective of the team without the bid is to make their opponents \"go set\".\n\nWhen a team with the winning bid fails to reach the amount they bid, they go set. When a team goes set, they lose whatever amount that they won the bid with. For example, if a team wins the bidding with a 6 bid and is only able to take 5 points on that hand, they lose 6 points from their total. Negative points are allowed.\n\nIn some variations, doubling of the bid is allowed as a half-point bet. For example, if one player bids 5, the next player may bid '5 for 10', effectively doubling the outcome if they're right or wrong. A bid of 6 would be larger than '5 for 10' but could be outbid by the following player with a '6 for 12'. If a player with a doubled bid goes set, they get negative points for the entire bet (-10 or -12 in these examples).\n\nThe first team to 32 points wins. If the game ends with both teams with 32 or more points, the team that won the bid on the final hand is the winner.\n\n\nPlayed like \"Oklahoma Ten-Point\" with a few variations. After the bid, the \"maker\" takes the deck, declares the trump, and discards down to six cards. All other players must discard non-trumps, but do not receive additional cards. This variant always incorporates the \"Call for partner\" rule.\n\nPlayed like \"Oklahoma Ten-Point\" with some variations. The minimum opening bid is 5. 10 point bid is \"Shoot the Moon.\" After the bids, the winning bidder declares suit. Bidder get the remaining cards in the deck but only keeps 6 cards. All other players hold their original 6 cards so other players don't know how many suit cards they have. Also the player who holds the Low card '2' gets to keep that card in when the trick is played. If no one is willing to bid 5 points the dealer get a 5 bid 'Dumped on them'.\n\nAlso known as \"ster-don.\" Seven cards are dealt to each player. Points available are High, Low, Jack, Game, Five Trump, & Last Trick. In this variation, the Low point is made by capturing the lowest trump (rather than simply playing it, as is usual). The Five of Trump is counted for 5 points, the other points only one each for a total of 10 possible points. \nAfter trump is declared, players must discard ALL non-Trumps and are re-dealt to a seven card hand. First card played does not have to be Trump. The \"Forced Bid\" rule is in effect. The game ends when one player reaches 50 points. \"Win by 2\" and \"float (first) to 57\" can both be declared before the game starts\n\nPlayed much like \"Campbell Ten-Point\" with the addition of the \"Off-Ace\". The Off-Ace, like the \"Off-Jack\", is not in the \"trump suit\" but is of the same color. It is worth one point and ranks just below the Ace. Play ends at 51 points rather than 32. The \"Misdeal\" rule is in effect, as is \"Shoot the Moon\", which is differentiated from and superior to a perfect bid (11) in that \"Shoot the Moon\" automatically wins or loses the game. Only the 17 Trump cards are legal for play. A five-player variation exists: here, each player has an individual, not partnership, score; partnerships change each round and are determined by the winning bidder calling for one specific Trump card to be led. The player who plays this Trump joins the winning bidder's partnership for that one round, and the other three players join the opposing partnership.\n\nRoadhouse Pitch is an auction pitch variant. Four points are awarded for High, Low, Jack, and Game, scored for their eventual owners. Games are played to 15, with a win by two requirement. Bidding proceeds clockwise, the player left of the dealer assuming the first bid. Players wishing to bid must bid a minimum of two. In addition to bidding two, three, or four; players may also \"Shoot the Moon\", requiring them to win every trick and all four points. Shooting the Moon is valued at 15 points, failure to win every trick and all four points results in a setback. Negative scoring is allowed. In the event the bid is passed to the dealer, the dealer must assume the minimum bid (or \"Shoot the Moon\"). The player with the highest bid pitches the first card, thus denoting trump. Players must follow suit regardless of trump, resulting in the primary variation from auction pitch. A player may not trump in unless they are unable to follow suit. The remaining gameplay follows that of classic pitch.\n\nAlso known as \"Kentucky Seven-Point\". There are seven possible points: High, Low, Jack, Off-Jack, Big Joker, Little Joker, and Game. The game is played to 21 points. Bids between 3 and 7 are allowed. The highest bidder calls trumps, and players discard non-trump cards face up in the center of the table. The dealer then distributes 6 cards to each player in batches of 1.\n\nIn Southeast Missouri this version, called 7-point Pitch, is played with a 34 card deck (2's-6's removed with a 10 card blind, no discarding). Points and Bids are the same as described above, and cards are dealt singly or 3 at a time.\n\nThis variant allows High, Low, Jack, and Off-Jack points and was originally meant for cutthroat play. Bids are from 2-4. The bid-winning player can only receive the number of points bid with one exception: If the bid-winning player earns points equal to their bid (no higher), he or she receives one extra point towards the total. Non-making players earn points only if the making player is set with one exception: the Off-Jack, which can be claimed by anyone. Finally, players \"must\" follow suit in this variant - trumping in is allowed only if a player has no on-suit cards. House rules may permit a game point which is calculated by using the 10s only, such that the player who takes the most 10s is awarded the game point and no player receives this point if there is a tie. Like the Off-Jack point, the game point can be claimed by any player.\n\nHigh Five is a very rare Swiss variation of pitch played with two teams of two. This variant uses 9-card hands. Points used are High, Low, Jack, Off-Jack, Big Joker, Little Joker, Ten, Five, and Off-Five. Five and Off-Five are each worth 5 points. Bids are from 6 to 17, the \"Shoot the Moon\" variant is used.\nAfter bids are made, each player discards all non-trumps (or to a six-card hand). The dealer restores each hand to six cards, skipping the \"making\" player. Finally, the \"making\" player may search the deck, choosing cards to bring their hand to six.\n\nSeven point pitch is played the same as ten point pitch, except that the three is not counted as a point. In case of a tie in counting up game, any jokers count as a half point to break the tie. Seven point pitch is usually played in eastern Nebraska\n\nSeventeen Point\n\nSeventeen point pitch is played the same as ten point pitch, except that the three does not count as three points. Instead, the five and off-five each count five points.\n\nThis variant, also called \"New Yorker Pitch\", points available are: High, Low, Jack, and Game. Bids 2-4 are allowed, and the \"Forced bid\" and \"Shoot the Moon\" rules are used. After bidding, the trump is declared; next players may discard any non-trumps they choose. The dealer distributes cards so that each player has six. Play proceeds as normal, 15 points wins.\n\nFour players play in two partnerships, sitting crosswise.\nIn all variants of Nine-Five the Five of trumps and the Nine of trumps score many game points when captured in tricks: 5 and 9, respectively. The minimum bid is 4 or 9. The maximum number of points that can be won is 18. A minimum bid of 9 is forced if a player holds the 9 and another card of the same suit, however the high bidder may choose a trump suit other than the suit that forced their bid.\n\nNine cards are dealt to each player. A \"smudge\" bid is worth 19 points in this variant. A \"blind smudge\" bid must be made before the player looks at his or her hand. It is worth 20 points.\n\nThe winning bidder declares the trump suit, and each player discards any non-trump cards. If a player has more than six trumps, he or she must discard down to six cards. Next, the dealer will deal each player back up to six total cards. Finally, the dealer brings his or her own hand to six cards, and is allowed to look at remaining cards when doing so. If too few trump cards remain, the dealer may take any card he or she chooses. This discard process ensures that all trump cards are in play.\n\nGame play is normal with the 2 winning conditions: the first team to win a bid that brings them above 100 points or if a team reaches -100 points the other team is declared winner. (A variant to the scoring is that if a team reaches -200 points it is considered a \"backdoor\" and the game is a draw.)\n\nLegal bids are 9–18. 18 is called \"hotshot\". The pitcher need not lead a trump. Bidding \"hotshot\" makes the game sudden death; if the bidder succeeds and collects all 18 points in the round, he wins the entire game, but if he fails, the game is over.\n\nThe player to the left of the pitcher leads the first card, and is not required to lead trump. If all players pass, the cards are shown face up to prove the lack of a forced bid, and the deal is passed to the left. Holding a \"9\" and another card of the same suit is a forced minimum bid of 9.\n\nThe winning bidder will announce the trump suit, players will then discard unwanted cards face up into the \"scrap pile\" The dealer then deals the draw cards to bring each player back to six cards. Note: Discarded \"Trump\" cards can be claimed by any player simply by pulling them out of the scrap, (this rarely happens but prevents a dump of point cards, i.e. 9 & 5). The scoring is exactly the same as traditional \"Nines and Fives\". The game is won by the first team that scores 100 or more. This somewhat obscure variation of the lead forces the non bidding team to \"Block\" or \"Post\" a higher trump than the 9 if possible, to prevent the bidder from \"running' the 9 on the first trick and then forcing the bidder to play in between his opponents. The bidding partner helps greatly by playing the Ace or King on an early trick to give the bidder a chance to run the 9.\n\nSimilar to the Northwest Connecticut variation, with the only differences being in the bidding phase. Bidding can range from the minimum of 5 to a maximum of \"double-18.\" Double-18s require the team winning the bid to win every single trick and rewards 36 points. If no one bids, the dealer is required to take it for 5. Winning requires both a score over 100 and for the team to win the bidding and subsequently making their bid.\n\nPitch is played with 3 teams with 3 partners each. Partners are seated an equal 2 seat between each other. All 54 cards (including High Joker and Low Joker). Points are awarded for High Trump (Ace), Jack of Trump, High Joker, Low Joker, Low Trump (2) and trick/card points (82 points possible, each Joker worth 1/2 point). Each player left of the dealer has a chance to bid between 1-6 points with the winning bidder leading their trump. If a team does not make their bid they must give back any points (chips) they have accumulated and receive 1 negative point (pookie).\n\nReverse Pitch follows all of the rules of basic Pitch, except the low card takes each trick (the lowest card of the suit lead or lowest card of the trump suit). High, low, jack, and game points are scored in the normal fashion. In this variation, valuable cards become much harder to capture; the strength of the card itself is almost always insufficient.\n\nReaching the negative equivalent of the goal wins in some versions of Pitch. For example, when the goal is 11 points, a score of -11 or lower would win the game. Some variants instead allow a backdoor win for a team with extremely low points: with a goal of 100 points, -200 might win.\nIn some variants, the low trump wins the trick in which it is played. This is used only in variants where the 2 of trumps is certain to be played.\n\nTwo-Trump Pitch is a variation of which incorporates all 54 cards. It may be played with any combination of 3-9 players. Nine points are possible: High, Low, Jack, Sub-High, Sub-Low, Sub-Jack, both Jokers, & Game. Bids 3 (or 4) to 9 are allowed. Games are played to 26 points. In this variation, the player who wins the bid declares both the trump and sub-trump suits. Sub-trump cards rank above non-trumps, but below trumps. Players follow suit as in other variations; sub-trumps do not count as trumps for this purpose. Sub-trumps may be used to \"trump in,\" on non-trump leads, however. If a sub-trump is lead, main trump can be \"trumped in\". Jokers are unranked and cannot be used to capture other cards. When leading a Joker it is considered to be suit-less, the second play of the trick determines the lead suit, and players must follow suit as usual from there. If a trump suit is lead, Jokers may not be cut in if the player in possession of the joker has cards of that trump remaining. A Joker may be cut in at any time if a non-trump suit is lead, regardless of the players remaining cards. A further variant of the Two Trump game is to allow a Joker to be played if the other Joker was lead, regardless of the second card played in the trick and the rest of the players hand. This is known as the Double Down Override as it is performing a “double down” and adding at least a second point to the trick.\n\n\n"}

He owned a small electronics firm which specialized in electric votive candles for the Roman Catholic Church, and did statistical analysis for Statistics Canada. He defeated Julia Brady for the nomination by a margin of 213 votes to 186, after Marianne Wilkinson dropped out of the contest. In his acceptance speech, Insley spoke out against official bilingualism for Ontario (\"Ottawa Citizen\", 13 August 1987). He lost to Liberal candidate Bob Chiarelli by 6,392 votes, in a seat which had previously been safe for the PC Party (\"Ottawa Citizen\", 11 September 1987).\n\nInsley worked as an executive assistant to Ottawa mayor Jim Jones for three years, and returned to Windsor in 1994 to operate a business in the city. He received 4,187 votes (11.90%) in the 2003 election, finishing third against Liberal incumbent Sandra Pupatello.\n\nWhile campaigning for the provincial legislature, Insley also filed nomination papers for the fourth ward on Windsor's City Council. He was defeated for this position as well.\n\nInsley supported the creation of the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003, as a merger of the federal Progressive Conservative Party with the Canadian Alliance (\"Windsor Star\", 9 December 2003). In 2004, he wrote a public letter endorsing private options in health care. The same letter included words of support for Progressive Conservative leadership candidate Frank Klees that fell just short of an endorsement (\"Windsor Star\", 14 July 2004).\n\nThe February 8, 2007 by-election was necessitated by the resignation of former Ontario Liberal Party Member of Provincial Parliament Joe Cordiano, who represented York South—Weston in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from the date it was first established in the 1999 provincial election until his retirement in 2006.\n\nMartino placed third behind Paul Ferreira, trailing him by more than 6,000 votes.\n\nAlex Yuan was the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario candidate for Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in the provincial riding of Markham in a February 8, 2007 by-election. He lost to Ontario Liberal Party candidate Michael Chan. He ran in the newly formed riding of Richmond Hill for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in the October 2007 election and lost to Liberal Reza Moridi.\n"}

This is not to be confused with low-power broadcasting.\n\nMicrobroadcasting, in radio terms, is the use of low-power transmitters (often Title 47 CFR Part 15 in the United States, or its equivalent elsewhere) to broadcast a radio signal over the space of a neighborhood or small town. Similar to pirate radio broadcasting, microbroadcasters generally operate without a license from the local regulation body, but sacrifice range in favor of using legal power limits (for example, 100 mW for medium wave broadcasts in the United States). Higher power levels can be achieved using carrier current techniques, which are widely used in colleges and universities. Both AM and FM bands are used, although AM tends to have better propagation characteristics at low power.\n\nMicrobroadcasting is also used by schools and businesses to serve just the immediate campus of the operation; well-known uses include audio tour guide systems, airport information services, and drive-in theaters, which often provide movie audio over the driver's car audio system.

He is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nRiquier's \"vita\" was probably written at the end of the 7th century. Shortly after 800 it was revised by Alcuin at the request of Abbot Angilibert, who dedicated his work to Charlemagne. \n\nRicharius was born a pagan in the late 6th century in the county of Ponthieu near Amiens in Picardy in the north-west of France. According to the \"vita\" written by Alcuin, Richarius gave shelter to two Welsh missionaries, Caidocus and Frechorius, who were treated with great hostility by the local people who blamed the strangers for crop failure. Because he \"welcomed God in the persons of the travelers... this was why he was granted God's mercy.\" Richarius converted to Christianity under their influence. After his conversion, he fasted on barley bread mixed with ashes, and drank only water. He was ordained a priest, and traveled to England, preaching the Gospel and curing the sick. Travelling by donkey rather than horse, he read the psalter as he rode.\n\nIn 638, after some years in England, Richarius founded a monastery in his hometown in Ponthieu that was named Centule (or \"Centula\", alteration of Latin \"Centum Turres\": \"hundred towers\"). This monastery practised according to the Rule of Saint Columbanus of Luxeuil. A city developed around this monastery, also named Centule. In the Middle Ages it was renamed to Saint-Riquier. Nowadays it has some 1200 inhabitants, who still refer to themselves as \"Centulois\". The Frankish king Dagobert I once came to visit the monastery, and Richarius offered the king advice. He was frank and clear in his speech to the king, speaking without fear or flattery, and the king thereafter became a benefactor of the monastery. Others also gave generously to Richarius's monastery, and he was able to use the money to help lepers and the poor and to ransom prisoners held by England.\n\nRicharius eventually founded a second monastery called Forest-Montier. He made a shelter in the forest of Crécy, fifteen miles from his monastery. He lived there as a hermit with his disciple Sigobart. On April 26, 643, he bid farewell to Sigobart and died.\n\nHis relics were first put in a coffin made of an oak trunk and then translated to the abbey of Centula. One hundred and fifty years later, Charlemagne built a golden shrine to enclose the relics and had the Saint-Riquier Gospels made for the shrine. In 950 Count Arnulf I transferred the bones to Montreuil, then to the Abbey of Saint Bertin in today's St-Omer; in 980 Hugo Capet returned them to St-Riquier. Above the tomb of Riquier, an abbey was built, which was later named after him, as was the city.\n\nAside from Saint-Riquier, the city of Saint-Riquier-en-Rivière in Normandy bears his name, and there is one church in England St Ricarius Church, Aberford, a town the saint is supposed to have visited in 630.\n\nMedieval monks compiled a catalogue of flowers for each day in the year, and dedicated each flower to a particular Saint, on account of it flowering about the time of the Saint's feast day. The flower \"Erysimum barbarea\" (yellow rocket or wintercress) is associated with Richarius, whose feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is April 26. A feast for the translation of his relics is celebrated on October 9.\n\n"}

In the Nile Expedition of 1884–85, he was appointed to the staff, again in command of the mounted infantry.\n\nHutton had become closely linked with the employment of mounted infantry in the African campaigns, and was the army's leading authority on its use; in 1886, he gave a public lecture calling for a widespread scheme of training and preparing mounted infantry units within the units stationed in Britain. He was supported by Sir Garnet Wolseley, a prominent Army moderniser, and Hutton was given command of the newly raised composite regiment of mounted infantry at Aldershot in 1887, promoted lieutenant colonel in 1889 and colonel in 1892. Wolseley's support of Hutton has led him to be named as a member of the influential \"Wolseley ring\" by some biographers, but he was five to ten years younger than most members, and other sources often do not list him as a member of the group.\n\nHis influence was strengthened by his marriage, in 1889, to Eleanor Mary Paulet, daughter of Rev. Lord Charles Paulet, and niece of the Marquess of Winchester and of Field-Marshal Lord William Paulet. His improved social connections led to him being appointed as an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria in 1892.\n\nIn 1893, Hutton was named commandant of the military forces in New South Wales and promoted to the temporary rank of major general. He was recalled in 1896 for a year's service in Ireland as chief staff officer in the Dublin district and at the Curragh.\n\nIn 1898, he was again temporary promoted to the rank of major general and made General Officer Commanding the Militia of Canada.\n\nWhen the Second Boer War with South Africa was on the horizon, Hutton lobbied Canada to participate. Without informing Canada's Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Hutton published mobilization plans in the \"Canadian Military Gazette\". Laurier's government then received a letter of gratuity from Britain for its decision to aid them in the Boer region. Furious, Laurier announced Canada's refusal to send any contingents. In the end, political pressure was too great, and Canada played a role in the war. However, the row led to Hutton being recalled in early 1900. Replying to a question in the Dominion House of Commons, Laurier said that the causes of the difference were that Hutton was \"insubordinate and indiscreet and deliberately ignored the authority of the Minister of Militia in the administration of his department\".\n\nIn early March 1900 Hutton left Southampton in the \"SS Tantallon Castle\", which arrived in South Africa later the same month. He took up the post as Commander of the 1st Mounted Infantry Brigade, a formation made up of Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand troops. This force was actively engaged both during Lord Roberts's advance from Bloemfontein and after the fall of Pretoria. When the brigade was broken up in November 1900, he returned to the United Kingdom, where he was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for his services in the South African campaign.\n\nHutton was in November 1901 appointed Honorary Colonel of the 7th (Militia) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps.\n\nIn late November 1901 it was announced that Hutton would become the first General Officer Commanding the Australian Military Forces. He was recommended by Field Marshal Lord Roberts after several other officers had refused or were rejected by the government. He arrived in Australia in January 1902, and his main task became that of transforming six colonial forces into one national Australian Army.\n\nIn 1904, Hutton promoted what was then a novel idea that Empire military attachés should be sent to witness the clash of Russian and Japanese forces in Manchuria. Australian sources reveal a nested array of factors affecting the mission of Colonel John Hoad, who was detached by the Deakin government to serve with the Imperial Japanese Army in 1904–1905. Along with other Western military attachés, Hoad had two complementary missions–to assist the Japanese and to observe the Japanese forces in the field during the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nHutton resigned as GOC Australian Military Force at the end of 1904.\n\nAfter his resignation, Hutton was appointed commander of 3rd Division in 1905, holding the command until 1906, and given a post overseeing administration in Eastern Command. In November 1907 he was promoted lieutenant general, shortly before his retirement. In 1914, he was recalled from retirement to command the newly raised 21st Division in the New Armies – the Australian government having turned down a suggestion he should be offered command of the Australian Imperial Force – but fell ill early in 1915, after a riding accident, and was relieved of command in April.\n\nIn retirement, he wrote a history of the King's Royal Rifle Corps, and a number of pamphlets on military affairs.\n\nHe was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.\n\nHutton died in 1923; he was survived by his wife; the couple had no children.\n"}

She was a child actress and appeared in the Broadway production of \"I Remember Mama\", which she writes about in her 2004 memoir \"Missing Men\".\n\nAt 13, she began spending time in Washington Square Park, a nexus of the era’s bohemian and folk-music culture. She attended Barnard College at 16. There she became friends with Elise Cowen (briefly Allen Ginsberg's lover) who introduced her to the Beat circle. Ginsberg arranged for Glassman and Kerouac to meet on a blind date while she was working on her first novel, \"Come and Join the Dance\", which was sold to Random House when she was 21 and was published five years later in 1962 just as she was starting her long career as a book editor.\n\nShe was married briefly to abstract painter James Johnson, who was killed in a motorcycle accident. From her second marriage, to painter Peter Pinchbeck, which ended in divorce, came her son, Daniel Pinchbeck, also an author.\n\nJohnson's fiction and articles have appeared in \"Harper's\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", \"New York\", \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"The New Yorker\", \"Vanity Fair\" and \"The Washington Post\".\n\nIn her memoir \"Minor Characters\" (Houghton Mifflin, 1983), the book for which she is best known, Johnson reflects on her adolescence and college years, as well as on the 1957 and 1958 period when Kerouac rose from obscurity to fame following the publication of his novel \"On the Road\". The book brought attention to the experiences of women associated with the Beat Generation writers. It won a 1983 National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\nJohnson has published three novels: \"Come and Join the Dance\" (by Joyce Glassman) (Atheneum, 1962), \"Bad Connections\" (Putnam, 1978), and \"In the Night Cafe\" (Dutton, 1987). \"Come and Join the Dance\" has been recognized by scholars such as Ann Douglas, Nancy Grace and Ronna Johnson as the first Beat novel by a woman. She has also published a work of investigative journalism: \"What Lisa Knew: The Truths and Lies of the Steinberg Case\" (Putnam, 1989).\n\nFrom 1983 through 1997, she taught writing at Columbia University's MFA program. She has also taught at the New School, the Breadloaf Writers Conference, the University of Vermont and New York University, and at the 92nd Street YMHA.\n\n\"The Children's Wing,\" the penultimate chapter of her novel \"In The Night Cafe\" (1989), was a first-prize O. Henry Award recipient. In 1992, she received an NEA grant. \n\nThe Johnson and Kerouac correspondence, collected in \"Door Wide Open: A Beat Love Affair in Letters, 1957–1958\" (2000), was followed by another memoir, \"Missing Men\" (2004). In 2012, she published her biography of Kerouac \"The Voice Is All: The Lonely Victory of Jack Kerouac\". Though some critics have erroneously called this book a memoir, Johnson ends Kerouac's story six years before she met him, and makes only a few relevant references to the relationship they had from January 1957 through October 1958.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1803350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803350", "title": "Norte del Valle Cartel", "text": "Norte del Valle Cartel\n\nThe Norte del Valle Cartel (), or North Valley Cartel, was a drug cartel that operated principally in the north of the Valle del Cauca department of Colombia. It rose to prominence during the second half of the 1990s, after the Cali and Medellín Cartels fragmented, and it was known as one of the most powerful organizations in the illegal drug trade. The drug cartel was led by the brothers Luis Enrique and Javier Antonio Calle Serna, alias \"Los Comba\", until its takedown in 2012 by the authorities of the United States.\n\nIt is alleged that the Norte del Valle cartel was formed after an event where the brothers Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela and Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, leaders of the Cali Cartel, came to an agreement with the Colombian government that if they surrendered themselves and their organization to the Colombian justice system they would be given perks, such as imprisonment in Colombian prisons for not more than five years and the promise of no expropriation of their substantial assets. It is stated that they organized a meeting with their lieutenants, main subordinates, and junior partners in the business, to inform them that the decision had already been taken to stop all the illicit business immediately. Those members who refused this sudden dissolution, including Carlos Alberto Rentería Mantilla, Juan Carlos Ortiz Escobar, Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, Diego León Montoya Sánchez, and Orlando Henao Montoya, formed the North Valley cartel.\n\nIts members were José Orlando Henao Montoya alias \"El Hombre Overol\" (The Overall Man), Colonel Danilo Gonzalez, Ivan Urdinola Grajales Alias \"El Enano\" (The Dwarf) Efrain Hernandez Ramirez \"Don Efra\" (Mr. Efra), Andres Lopez Lopez \"Florecita\" (Floweret); Arcangel de Jesus Henao Montoya \"El Mocho\", middle brother of Orlando Henao, Lorena Henao Montoya \"La Viuda De La Mafia\" (The Mafia Widow) sister of Orlando Henao, Wilber Alirio Varela Fajardo, \"Jabón\" (Soap), Diego León Montoya Sanchez \"Don Diego\" (Mr. Diego), Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia \"Chupeta\" (Lollipop), Luis Hernando Gomez Bustamante \"Rasguño\" (Scratch), Victor Patiño Fomeque \"El Quimico\" (The Chemist) or \"La Fiera\" (The Beast). Ex member of Cali Cartel, Luis Alfonso Ocampo Fomeque \"Tocayo\" (Namesake) half brother of Victor Patiño, Carlos Alberto Renteria Mantilla \"Beto Renteria\", Ramon Alberto Quintero Sanclemente \"RQ\", Miguel Fernando Solano \"Don Miguelito\" (Mr. Miguelito) Juan Carlos Ortiz Escobar \"Cuchilla\" (Blade) and Jorge Eliecer Asprilla \"El Negro Asprilla\".\n\nAccording to Diego Montoya's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) profile, the U.S. government accuses him of being involved in the willing production and distribution of multiple tons of cocaine into the United States. It also considers him and his organization as heavily relying on violence enjoying the protection of both right-wing and left-wing illegal armed groups classified as terrorist organizations by the U.S. government.\n\nAccording to a 2004 U.S. government Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) indictment, between 1990 and 2004, the Norte del Valle cartel exported more than 1.2 million pounds – or 500 metric tons – of cocaine worth in excess of $10 billion from Colombia to Mexico and ultimately to the United States for resale.\n\nThe indictment charges that the Norte del Valle cartel used violence and brutality to further its goals, including the murder of rivals, individuals who failed to pay for cocaine, and associates who were believed to be working as informants.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the cartel members employed the services of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing paramilitary organization internationally classified as terrorist, to protect the cartel's drug routes, its drug laboratories, and its members and associates. The AUC is one of the 37 Foreign Terrorist Organizations identified by the U.S. State Department in 2004.\n\nLeaders of the Norte del Valle cartel allegedly bribed and corrupted Colombian law enforcement and Colombian legislators to, among other things, attempt to block the extradition of Colombian narcotics traffickers to the United States to be prosecuted for their crimes. According to the indictment, members of the Norte del Valle cartel even conducted their own wiretaps in Colombia to intercept the communications of rival drug traffickers and Colombian and United States law enforcement officials.\n\nThe chiefs of the Norte del Valle cartel at one time included Orlando Henao a.k.a. \"el hombre del overol\" (\"The overall man\"), Montìguéz Franco a.k.a. \"Monty\", Diego León Montoya Sánchez, a.k.a. \"Don Diego\", Wilber Varela, a.k.a. \"Jabón\" (\"Soap\"), and Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, a.k.a. \"Chupeta\" (\"Lollipop\"). Until his capture in late 2007 Diego Montoya was part of the list containing the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.\n\nFierce rivalries that divided the cartel into warring factions erupted in 2003 when Hernando Gómez, Wilber Varela and their inner circle, prompted by a rising number of extradition of cartel members to the United States, apparently attempted to negotiate a possible surrender deal with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), in a move which was strongly rejected by Diego Montoya and several of the other cartel drug lords. After a failed hit on Varela left him in the hospital with multiple gunshots, Varela declared war on Diego Montoya who he held responsible for the attack.\n\nThis situation led to brutal gang warfare, which left a deathtoll of more than 1,000 people between 2003 and 2004 throughout different northern locations of the Valle del Cauca department.\n\nThe consequences of such an internal vendetta led Colombian authorities to intervene in order to increase law enforcement efforts against the cartel, which resulted in the 2004 arrest of some 100 assassins in the employ of both rival factions, and in the 2005 capture of Varela's close associate Julio César López (alias \"Ojitos\", or \"Small Eyes\"), and Montoya's chief hatchetman, Carlos José Robayo Escobar (alias \"Guacamayo\", or \"Macaw\"), among others. On June 4, 2008 Julio César López was sentenced to 45 years in federal prison by a federal court in New York. More than $100 million worth in properties and luxury assets was also seized, along with an almost complete fiberglass narco submarine that would have been built by the cartel in order to smuggle drugs into the United States and other foreign countries.\n\nAll of these events may have influenced several members of the Norte del Valle cartel to seek a deal with Colombian and U.S. drug enforcement authorities during late 2004 and early 2005, whether through direct negotiation proposals or employing the possible protection that they may gain through the infiltration of the AUC's then ongoing peace negotiations with the Colombian government.\n\nDiego Montoya was captured in Colombia on September 10, 2007. Wilber Varela was killed in the Venezuelan city of Mérida.\n\nThe Norte del Valle Cartel is believed to be the single most powerful existing cartel in Colombia with exception of the smaller North Coast Cartel, the FARC Marxist guerrilla, and the right wing paramilitary group AUC. Due to their violent warfare that left more than 1,000 people dead between 2003 and 2004, the Colombian government with support of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FBI, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have pursued the cartel heavily for over four years.\n\nThe first significant blow to be dealt to the Norte del Valle Cartels internal membership came with the arrest of Juan Carlos Montoya Sánchez, brother to top Norte del Valle boss Diego Montoya. Juan Carlos was arrested in December 2003 in Colombia and extradited to the United States two years later on May 4, 2005 where he was sentenced to 262 months in prison for drug trafficking and money laundering. He was believed to be responsible for overseeing the cartel's cocaine laboratories. Along with Juan Carlos, Carlos Felipe Toro Sánchez, alias \"Pipe\", was arrested. Carlos Felipe was believed to be responsible for overseeing the drug shipments of cocaine to their destination in the U.S., Mexico, and Europe. Carlos Felipe was extradited to the United States ten days before Juan Carlos, on April 25, 2005. The following month after the capture of Juan Carlos came the arrest of José Dagoberto Flores Ríos whose alias is \"Chuma.\" Jose Dagoberto, who was the top lieutenant to Arcángel Henao Montoya, was arrested in January 2004 in Colombia and later extradited to the United States where he is in custody in New York.\nIn 2004, four additional captures occurred of Norte del Valle hierarchy. The capture of Arcángel Henao Montoya, also known as \"El Mocho\" (\"The Amputee\"), was a top leader of the cartel. Arcángel was arrested on January 10, 2004, in Panama and extradited to New York. In July 2004 Luis Hernando Gómez Bustamante, alias \"Rasguño\" (\"Scratch\"), one of the founders and top leaders of the cartel, was arrested on July 2, 2004, trying to enter Cuba on a false passport. He was held in Cuba awaiting extradition to Colombia and ultimately to the U.S. In March 2004, the Colombian government seized properties belonging to Bustamante in excess of $100 million. He would not be extradited to the United States for over three years. Gabriel Puerta Parra, alias \"El Doctor\" (\"The Doctor\"), was arrested on October 7, 2004, near Bogotá, Colombia. Gabriel Puerta was an attorney and counselor to the Norte del Valle cartel. He acted as a highly respected intermediary between the Norte del Valle Cartel and major Mexican cartels, assisted in resolving disputes within the cartel and, influencing the Colombian government with extradition matters. He invested his own money in drug shipments and facilitated money laundering operations through front companies he owned and setup for the cartel, as well as acquiring local and international real estate to launder the cartel's illegal proceeds.\n\nArrests continued throughout 2005 as José Aldemar Rendón Ramírez, alias \"Mechas\", was arrested by Colombian authorities on July 15, 2005. José Aldemar operated as a financial officer within the Norte del Valle Cartel, responsible for the launder of its illegal proceeds. Jhonny Cano Correa, alias \"Flecha\" (\"Arrow\"), was arrested later the year on October 29, 2005. Jhonny Cano operated as a chief of security for Luis Hernando Gómez Bustamante. He was responsible for ensuring the security of cocaine processing laboratories, drug shipments, and murdering rivals. He was eventually extradited to the United States in September 2006.\n\nFollowing the capture of Luis Hernando Gómez Bustamante, and his chief of security, Jhonny Cano, came the capture of Bustamante's lieutenant, Jaime Maya Durán, alias \"Alejandro\". Following Bustamante's arrest, Durán assumed more responsibility within the cartel. He was captured in Mexico in September 2006 and shortly after extradited to the United States. The following month brought the capture of Orlando Sabogal Zuluaga, alias \"Alberto\", another high-ranking lieutenant to Luis Hernando Gómez Bustamante on October 31, 2006 in a shopping mall in Spain.\n\nIn 2007 five members of the cartel were captured, Eugenio Montoya Sánchez, alias \"Don Hugo\", younger brother to top cartel boss Diego Montoya, was arrested January 15, 2007, in the Cartel's stronghold town of El Dovio. It is believed Eugenio took over his brother's major operations to allow his brother to remain at large from Colombian and U.S. authorities.\nFebruary 2007 brought about the extradition of Luis Hernando Gómez Bustamante, arrested years prior. Bustamante was extradited to Colombia from Cuba on July 20, 2007, he was then handed over to DEA agents in Bogotá for transport to the United States. Bustamante reportedly offered to cooperate with U.S. authorities in exchange for protection after receiving numerous death threats while in Colombian custody. February also led to the capture of Laureano Rentería, right-hand man to Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, Laureano Renteria was detained at one of Ramirez's stash houses containing $19 million. He tried convincing authorities he was a simple construction worker hired to remodel the house and accepted a plea deal to 44 months in prison. While in prison an informant in New York revealed he was Ramírez's confidant who protected Ramirez during their six-year prison term served in a Colombia during the 1990s. Laureano Renteria was responsible for managing Ramírez's financial structure including the stash house logistics and bribing of high Colombian government officials. When the DEA learned of this information they had the Colombian authorities transfer Rentería to a maximum security prison to await a speedy extradition to the US. On February 27, 2007, the extradition order was to be served, but authorities found Rentería dead in his cell due to cyanide poisoning. His death went unsolved, but Ramírez is suspected to have ordered the hit to prevent him from revealing vital cartel secrets.\n\nOn February 25, 2007, Eduardo Restrepo Victoria, also known as \"El Socio\", was arrested in Colombia. It is believed that Eduardo is the right-hand man and the partner of the cartel leader, Wilber Varela. On September 7, 2006, Colombian police seized 65 Restrepo properties in the cities of Bogota, Cali and no state of Tolima valued at more than US$25 million. Henry Loaiza Ceballos, \"El Alacran\" (\"The Scorpion\"). When he was captured and extradited, Restrepo assumed its operations in partnership with Varela.[23] The month following the capture of Juan Carlos Ramirez-Abadia, incidentally \"Chupeta\", one of the main masters of Cartel Norte del Valle. In January 2007, four separate raids of Ramírez's houses in the city of Cali, Colombia. Ramirez was arrested in Brazil on August 7, 2007.[24] Ramirez was extradited by Brazil to the United States on Friday, August 22, 2008.\nDiego León Montoya Sánchez, alias \"Don Diego\", \"El Señor de la Guerra\" (\"The Warlord\"), was arrested on September 10, 2007, at 8:20 a.m., in a rural farm house in Valle, Colombia. Montoya was believed to be the top leader of the Norte Del Valle Cartel. The arrest of Diego Leon ends the Montoya Clan's claim in drug trafficking, with Juan Carlos Montoya Sánchez serving a 262-month prison term in the United States and his younger brother Eugenio Montoya Sánchez detained in a maximum security prison in Colombia awaiting extradition. After news of Montoya's arrest, Colombian Defense Minister claimed his extradition to the US was inevitable. He was extradited to Miami on December 12, 2008.\n\nThe Colombian and US governments were targeting Wilber Varela, believing he would try to take over Montoya's business as well and possibly start another war with the emerging leaders. However, Varela was found murdered on January 30, 2008, in a hotel resort in the state of Mérida in Venezuela. Colombian authorities believe he was murdered by his own men on orders of jailed paramilitary drug lord Carlos Mario Jimenez alias \"Macaco\" to end Varela's power struggle in the rival city Medellin and surrounding areas in Antioquia. Jimenez was later extradited to the United States on May 7, 2008, for failing to meet the terms of his surrender and for continuing to run his criminal organization in prison.\n\nOn June 1, 2009, Aldemar Álvarez Tabares alias \"Pelón\", the supposed successor of Bustamante, was arrested in Cali. Ramón Quintero Sanclemente (alias \"RQ\" or \"Lucas\"), an old guard high-ranking member of the cartel, was arrested in Quito (Ecuador) and immediately deported to Colombia. Quintero is now being held in the Combita maximum security prison, awaiting extradition proceedings to the United States. Quintero was one of the 10 most wanted DEA drug traffickers in the world, and he had a reward for his capture, valued up to $5 million. Quintero was accused of being one of the last leaders of the NVC organization, and also of trafficking large amounts of cocaine through Mexico using his Mexican cartel connections / partners (some reports claim that his organization was moving up to 50 metric tons per year to the United States and Europe). The formal request for extradition was submitted by the United States in July 2009. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Bonnie S. Klapper and Walter M. Norkin in the Eastern District of New York. Colombia's Supreme Court approved Quintero's extradition on June 28, 2011. He was extradited on December 12, 2011. On November 21, 2012, South Florida judge William P. Dimitrouleas sentenced Quintero to 210 months (17 years) in federal prison on charges of conspiring to import cocaine to the United States. \n\nDiego Montoya's arrest and Wilber Varela's murder closed a chapter in Colombia's war on drugs. However, Colombian and US officials have identified the remaining cartel members that may fight for leadership of the organization. Authorities have identified the following targets as possible successors for both the Montoya and Varela Organization. As a preventive initiative, the Colombian government has issued arrest warrants for all these men before they can organize and restructure the cartel. Close to $250,000 is being offered for information leading to the arrest of each suspect. All suspects have extradition requests from the United States.\n\nLos Machos is a Colombian drug trafficking paramilitary organization. The group started as Montoya's security force. Oscar Varela Garcia alias \"Capachivo\" is posed as the most likely candidate to assume leadership. Fifty-four-year-old Varela, along with the Robayo brothers, has control of Montoya's security force of Los Machos. Varela started his career as a hitman with Wilber Varela for the late drug baron Orlando Henao Montoya. Varela remained friends with Wilber Varela until he sided with Montoya during the Montoya-Varela war. Oscar Varela's name became known after he organized the Jamundí massacre, where ten investigative agents were murdered by a corrupt military unit. On July 5, 2008, Varela was captured by Colombian authorities in a farmhouse in Palmira, Valle del Cauca. The operation was during the early morning where Varela was captured while he was sleeping in his underwear with his girlfriend.\n\nJorge Urdinola Perea alias \"La Iguana\" (\"The Iguana\") is another potential candidate. Urdinola is 42 years old and is cousin to the late drug baron Ivan Urdinola Grajales. He owns and operates many drug laboratories in the cartel's stronghold of the Canon Of Garrapatas and in the Colombian state of Choco. He is also the current leader of Diego Montoya's private army and hit squad \"Los Machos\". If Urdinola assumes control, his brother Hilbert Urdinola Perea alias \"Don H\" (Mr. H), will also co-lead. On June 25, 2008, Jorge Urdinola Perea was captured by Colombian authorities in Zarzal, Valle del Cauca.\n\nThe fourth possible candidate was 39-year-old Gildardo Rodriguez Herrera alias \"El Señor de la Camisa\" (\"The Man of the Shirt\"). He started his career as a leftist guerrilla and after spending ten years at Montoya's side he learned the trade. He also managed Montoya's security forces of Los Machos. After Montoya's arrest, Gildardo was starting to gain strength until Colombian authorities captured him on May 16, 2008, in a farmhouse in the Colombian state of Cundinamarca. The arrest was made possible on information provided by an informant who was paid the reward money.\n\nLos Rastrojos was a Colombian drug trafficking paramilitary organization. The group was formed by Norte del Valle cartel capo Wilber Varela, alias \"Jabon\" and one of his right-hand men, \"Diego Rastrojo\", around 2004 when Varela fell out with fellow-capo Diego Leon Montoya, alias \"Don Diego\". The group became independent after the murder of its main founder in Venezuela in 2008 and has since become one of the most important drug trafficking organization in Colombia.\n\nAuthorities now believe Wilber Varela's main captains Diego Perez Henao alias \"Diego Rastrojo\" and Luis Enrique Calle alias \"Combatiente\" (\"Combatant\") conspired with AUC commander Carlos Mario Jiménez alias \"Macaco\" to murder Varela. With the murder of Varela, Jimenez consolidated himself as the maximum authority in drug trafficking in Colombia controlling the drug trade in ten Colombian states and having authority over the cartel. His control lasted until his extradition in 2008. Luis Enrique Calle's rise to power will include his brother Javier Antonio Calle. Together they operated Varela's drug laboratories and oversaw transportation through their controlled drug routes. Under Jimenez's conditions, the Varela organization was to leave any interests in Medellin and Antioquia and share power between Henao and the Calle brothers.\n\nOther Varela organization members of interest include Gilmer Humberto Quintero, alias \"Cabezon\" (\"Big Head\"), Ramon Quintero Sanclemente alias \"Lucas\" (arrested in Ecuador on April 2010, deported to Colombia for extradition proceedings to the United States), Jaime Umberto Palomino alias \"Piernas Locas\" (\"Crazy Legs\"), Roberto Londono Velez, Jaime Alberto Marin Zamora alias \"Beto\" (beto was captured in Venezuela in 2010), Jose Ignacio Bedoya Velez, and Diego Perez Henao's brother Wilmar Perez Henao. Longtime Varela partner Ramon Quintero is suspected of being the most powerful and experienced target but is suspected of being at war with Diego Perez Henao over a 10 million dollar dispute.\n\nGilmer Humberto Quintero was found dead inside a police station bathroom with a shot in the head. Apparently, he committed suicide with a .25 caliber pistol he had hidden from police when he was captured June 14, 2008.\n\nAfter Laureano Renteria's mysterious murder in his jail cell and the capture of Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía in Brazil, authorities identified Aldemar Rojas Mosquera as the most likely inheritor of Ramirez's organization.\n\n"}
{"id": "1803356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803356", "title": "Pro Milone", "text": "Pro Milone\n\nThe Pro Tito Annio Milone ad iudicem oratio (Pro Milone) is a speech made by Marcus Tullius Cicero in 52 BC on behalf of his friend Titus Annius Milo. Milo was accused of murdering his political enemy Publius Clodius Pulcher on the Via Appia. Cicero wrote the speech after the hearing and so the authenticity of the speech is debated among scholars.\n\nMilo was a praetor at the time who was attempting to gain the much-wanted post of consul. Clodius was a former tribune standing for the office of praetor. The charge was brought against Milo for the death of Clodius following a violent altercation on the Via Appia, outside Clodius' estate in Bovillae. After the initial brawl, it seems that Clodius was wounded during the fight that was started by both men's slaves.\n\nThe sequence of events described by the prosecution and the commentary of Asconius Pedianus (c. 100 AD), an ancient commentator who analyzed several of Cicero's speeches and had access to various documents that no longer exist, was this: the absence of a summary of the chain of events in Cicero's speech may be attributed to their incriminating evidence against Milo. Presumably, Cicero correctly realised that to be the primary weakness. It can be assumed, from the fact that the jury indeed convicted Milo, that it felt that although Milo may not have been aware of Clodius's initial injury, his ordering of Clodius' butchering warranted punishment.\n\nWhen initially questioned about the circumstances of Clodius' death, Milo responded with the excuse of self-defense and that it was Clodius who laid a trap for Milo to kill him. Cicero had to fashion his speech to be congruent with Milo's initial excuse, a restraint that probably affected the overall presentation of his case. To convince the jury of Milo's innocence, Cicero used the fact that following Clodius death, a mob of Clodius' own supporters, led by the scribe Sextus Cloelius, carried his corpse into the Senate house (curia) and cremated it using the benches, platforms, tables and scribes' notebooks, as a pyre. In doing so, it also burnt down much of the curia; Clodius' supporters also launched an attack on the house of the then \"interrex\", Marcus Lepidus. Pompey thus ordered a special inquest to investigate that as well as the murder of Clodius. Cicero refers to this incident throughout the \"Pro Milone\" by implying that there was greater general indignation and uproar at the burning of the curia than there was at the murder of Clodius.\n\nThe violent nature of the crime as well as its revolutionary repercussions (the case had special resonance with the Roman people as a symbol of the clash between the \"populares\" and the \"optimates\") made Pompey set up a handpicked panel of judges. Thus, he avoided the corruption, rife in the political scene of the late Roman Republic. In addition, armed guards were stationed around the law courts to placate the violent mobs of both sides' supporters.\n\nThe first four days of the trial were dedicated to opposition argument and the testimony of witnesses. On the first day, Gaius Causinius Schola appeared as a witness against Milo and described the deed in such a way as to portray Milo as a coldblooded murderer. That worked up Clodius' supporters, who terrified the advocate on Milo's side, Marcus Marcellus. As he began his questioning of the witnesses, the crowd drowned out his voice and surrounded him. The action taken by Pompey prevented much furore from the vehemently anti-Milo crowds for the rest of the case. On the second day of the trial, the armed cohorts were introduced by Pompey. On the fifth and final day, Cicero delivered \"Pro Milone\" in the hope of reversing the damning evidence, accrued over the previous days.\n\nThroughout the duration of his speech, Cicero does not even attempt to convince the judges that Milo did not kill Clodius. However there is a point in the speech where Cicero claims that Milo neither knew about nor saw Clodius's murder. Cicero claims that the killing of Clodius was lawful and in self-defense. Cicero even goes as far as to suggest that the death of Clodius was in the best interests of the republic, as the tribune was a \"popularis\" leader of the restless plebeian mobs who had plagued the political scene of the late Roman Republic. Possibly Cicero's strongest argument was that of the circumstances of the assault: its convenient proximity to Clodius' villa and the fact that Milo was leaving Rome on official business: nominating a priest for election in Lanuvium. Clodius, on the other hand, had been distinctly absent from his usual rantings in the popular assemblies (\"contiones\"). Milo was encumbered in a coach, with his wife, a heavy riding cloak and a retinue of harmless slaves (but his retinue also included slaves and gladiators as well as revellers for the festival at Lanuvium, and Cicero only implies their presence). Clodius, however, was on horseback not with a carriage, his wife or his usual retinue but with a band of armed brigands and slaves. If Cicero could convince the judges that Clodius had laid a trap for Milo, he could postulate that Clodius had been killed in self-defense. Cicero never even mentions the possibility that the two met by chance, the conclusion of both Asconius and Appian.\n\nClodius is made out repeatedly in the \"Pro Milone\" to be a malevolent, invidious, effeminate character who craves power and organises the ambush on Milo. Cicero gives Clodius a motive for setting a trap: the realisation that Milo would easily secure the consulship and so stand in the way of Clodius' scheme to attain greater power and influence as a praetor. Fortunately, there was plentiful material for Cicero to build that profile, such as the Bona Dea incident in 62 BC; involving Clodius stealing into the abode of the Pontifex Maximus of the time, Julius Caesar, during the ritual festival of the Bona Dea to which only women were allowed. It is said that he dressed up as a woman to gain access and pursue an illicit affair with Pompeia, the wife of Caesar. Clodius was taken to the law courts for this act of great impiety but escaped the punishment of death by bribing the judges, most of whom had been poor, according to Cicero, who was the prosecutor during the case.\n\nEarlier in his career, Lucullus had accused Clodius of committing incest with his sister Clodia and then Lucullus's wife; this allegation is mentioned several times to blacken Clodius' reputation.\n\nMilo, on the other hand, is perpetually depicted as a 'saviour of Rome' by his virtuous actions and political career up until then. Cicero even goes as far as to paint an amicable relationship with Pompey. Asconius, as he does with many other parts of the \"Pro Milone\", disputes that by claiming that Pompey was in fact \"afraid\" of Milo \"or else pretended to be afraid\", and he slept outside on the highest part of his property in the suburbs and had a constant body of troops to keep guard. His fear was attributed to a series of public assemblies in which Titus Munatius Plancus, a fervent supporter of Clodius, stirred up the crowd against Milo and Cicero and cast suspicion on Milo by shouting that he was preparing a force to destroy him.\n\nHowever, in the view of Plutarch, a 1st-century AD writer and biographer of notable Roman men, Clodius had also stirred up enmity between Pompey and himself along with the fickle crowds of the forum he controlled, with his malevolent goading.\n\nThe early part of the refutation of the opposition's arguments (\"refutatio\"), contains the first known exposition of the phrase \"silent enim leges inter arma\" (\"in times of war, the laws fall silent\"). It has since been rephrased as \"inter arma enim silent leges\", and was most recently used by the American media in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The phrase is integral to Cicero's argument. In the context of the \"Pro Milone\" the meaning behind the phrase remains the same as its use in contemporary society. Cicero was asserting that the killing of Clodius was admissible if it was an act of self-defence. The argument is that in extreme cases, when one's own life is immediately threatened, disregard of the law is justifiable. Indeed, Cicero goes as far as to say that such behaviour is instinctive (\"nata lex\": \"an inborn law\") to all living creatures (\"non instituti, sed imbuti sumus\": \"we are not taught [self-defence] through instruction, but through natural intuition\"). The argument of the murder of Clodius being in the public interest is only presented in the written version of the \"Pro Milone\", as, according to Asconius, Cicero did not mention it in the actual version delivered.\n\nThe speech also contains the first known use of the legal axiom \"res ipsa loquitur\" but in the form \"res loquitur ipsa\", (literally, \"the thing itself speaks\", but it is usually translated as \"the facts speak for themselves\"). The phrase was quoted in an 1863 judgment in the English case \"Byrne v Boadle\" and became the tag for a new common law doctrine.\n\nIn the account of later writer and Ciceronian commentator Asconius, the actual defense failed to secure an acquittal for Milo for three reasons:\n\n\nMilo was condemned for the murder by a margin of 38 votes to 13. Milo went into exile to the Gallic town of Massilia (Marseille). During his absence, Milo was prosecuted for bribery, unlawful association and violence, of all of which he was successfully convicted. As an example of the volatile, contradictory and confusing political atmosphere of the time, the superintendent of Milo's slaves, one Marcus Saufeius, was also prosecuted for the murder of Clodius shortly after the conviction of Milo. The team of Cicero and Marcus Caelius Rufus defended him and managed to acquit Saufeius by a margin of one vote. Furthermore, Clodius' supporters did not all escape unscathed. Clodius' associate, Sextus Cloelius, who supervised the cremation of Clodius' corpse, was prosecuted for the burning down of the \"curia\" and was convicted by an overwhelming majority of 46 votes.\n\nFollowing the trial, violence raged unchecked in the city between supporters of Clodius and Milo. Pompey had been made sole consul in Rome during the violent troubled times after the murder but before the legal proceedings against Milo had begun. He quelled the riots following this string of controversial cases with brutal military efficiency, temporarily regaining stability in Rome.\n\nThe \"Pro Milone\" text that survives now is a rewritten version, published by Cicero after the trial. Despite its failure to secure an acquittal, the surviving rewrite is considered to be one of Cicero's best works and is thought by many to be the \"magnum opus\" of his rhetorical repertoire. Asconius describes the \"Pro Milone\" as \"so perfectly written that it can rightly be considered his best\".\n\nThe speech is full of deceptively straightforward strategies. Throughout his speech, Cicero explicitly seems to follow his own rhetorical guidelines published in his earlier work \"De Inventione\", but on occasion, he subtly breaks away from the stylistic norms to emphasise certain elements of his case and use the circumstances to his advantage. As example, he places his refutation of the opposition's arguments (\"refutatio\") far earlier in the speech than is usual, and he pounces on the opportunity for a fast disproval of the plethora of evidence collected over the first four days of the trial. His arguments are interwoven with one another and coalesce during the conclusion (\"peroratio\"). There is heavy use of pathos throughout the speech, starting with his assertion of fear for the guards posted around the courts by Pompey in the special inquisition (the very first sentence of the speech contains the word \"vereor\" – \"I fear\").\n\nHowever, Cicero ends his speech fearless, becomes more emotive with each argument and finishes by the beseeching of his audience with tears to acquit Milo. Irony is omnipresent in the speech, along with continual appearances of humour and constant appeals to traditional Roman virtues and prejudices, all of the tactics designed solely to involve and persuade his jury.\n\nIn many ways, the circumstances surrounding the case were apposite for Cicero, forcing him back to his own oratorical foundations. The charge of \"vis\" (violence) against Milo not only suited a logical and analytical legal framework, with evidence indicating a specific time, date, place and cast for the murder itself, but also generally concerned actions that affected the community. That allowed Cicero ample maneuvering room to include details of the fire in the \"curia\" as well as the attack on Marcus Lepidus' house and the Bona Dea incident.\n\nMilo, having read the later published speech whilst in exile, joked that if Cicero had spoken that well in court, the former would \"not now be enjoying the delicious red mullet of Massilia\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1803364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803364", "title": "Head-on collision", "text": "Head-on collision\n\nA head-on collision is a traffic collision where the front ends of two vehicles such as cars, trains, ships or planes hit each other when traveling in opposite directions, as opposed to a side collision or rear-end collision.\n\nWith railways, a head-on collision occurs most often on a single line railway. This usually means that at least one of the trains has passed a signal at danger, or that a signalman has made a major error. Head-on collisions may also occur at junctions, for similar reasons. In the early days of railroading in the United States, such collisions were quite common and gave to the rise of the term \"Cornfield Meet.\" As time progressed and signalling became more standardized, such accidents became less frequent. Even so, the term still sees some usage in the industry. The origins of the term are not well known, but it is attributed to accidents happening in rural America where farming and cornfields were common. The first known usage of the term was in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe distance required for a train to stop is usually greater than the distance that can be seen before the next blind curve, which is why signals and safeworking systems are so important.\n\nNote: if the collision occurs at a station or junction, or trains are traveling in the same direction, then the collision is not a pure head-on collision.\n\nWith shipping, there are two main factors influencing the chance of a head-on collision. Firstly, even with radar and radio, it is difficult to tell what course the opposing ships are following. Secondly, big ships have so much momentum that it is very hard to change course at the last moment.\n\nThe NHTSA defines a headon collision as \n\nHead-on collisions are an often fatal type of road traffic collision. \n\nIn Canada, in 2017, 6,293 vehicles and 8,891 persons were involved in head-on collision, injuring 5,222 persons and killing 377 other.\n\nU.S. statistics show that in 2005, head-on crashes were only 2.0% of all crashes, yet accounted for 10.1% of U.S. fatal crashes. A common misconception is that this over-representation is because the relative velocity of vehicles traveling in opposite directions is high. While it is true (via Galilean relativity) that a head-on crash between two vehicles traveling at 50 mph is equivalent to a moving vehicle running into a stationary one at 100 mph, it is clear from basic Newtonian Physics that if the stationary vehicle is replaced with a solid wall or other stationary near-immovable object such as a bridge abutment, then the equivalent collision is one in which the moving vehicle is only traveling at 50 mph., except for the case of a lighter car colliding with a heavier one. The television show MythBusters performed a demonstration of this effect in a 2010 show.\n\nIn France, in the years 2017 and 2018, 2563 and 2556 head-on collisions (\"collision frontales\") outside built-up area outside motorways killed 536 and 545 people respectively. They represent about 16% of all the fatalities including the ones on motorways and within built-up area.\n\nIn Quebéc head-on collisions are involved in 8% of work related issues, but 23% when two vehicles are involved in rural high speed zone where the maximum speed is greater than 70 km/h (43.5 mph).\n\nHead-on collisions, sideswipes, and run-off-road crashes all belong to a category of crashes called lane-departure or road-departure crashes. This is because they have similar causes, if different consequences. The driver of a vehicle fails to stay centered in their lane, and either leaves the roadway, or crosses the centerline, possibly resulting in a head-on or sideswipe collision, or, if the vehicle avoids oncoming traffic, a run-off-road crash on the far side of the road.\n\nPreventive measures include traffic signs and road surface markings to help guide drivers through curves, as well as separating opposing lanes of traffic with wide central reservation (or median) and median barriers to prevent crossover incidents. Median barriers are physical barriers between the lanes of traffic, such as concrete barriers or cable barriers. These are actually roadside hazards in their own right, but on high speed roads, the severity of a collision with a median barrier is usually lower than the severity of a head-on crash.\n\nThe European Road Assessment Programme's Road Protection Score (RPS) is based on a schedule of detailed road design elements that correspond to each of the four main crash types, including head-on collisions. The Head-on Crash element of the RPS measures how well traffic lanes are separated. Motorways generally have crash protection features in harmony with the high speeds allowed. The Star Rating results show that motorways generally score well with a typical 4-star rating even though their permitted speeds are the highest on the network. But results from Star Rating research in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden have shown that there is a pressing need to find better median (central reservation), run-off and junction protection at reasonable cost on single carriageway roads.\n\nAnother form of head-on crash is the wrong-way entry crash, where a driver on a surface road turns onto an off-ramp from a motorway or freeway, instead of the on-ramp. They can also happen on divided arterials if a driver turns into the wrong side of the road. Considerable importance is placed on designing ramp terminals and intersections to prevent these incidents. This often takes to form of special signage at freeway off-ramps to discourage drivers from going the wrong way. Section 2B.41 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices describes how such signs should be placed on American highways.\n\nHead on collision does not need car to be involved, for instance, the Puisseguin road crash was between a truck and a coach.\n\nSideswipe collisions are where the sides of two vehicles traveling in the same or opposite directions touch. They differ from head-on collisions only in that one vehicle impacts the side of the other vehicle rather than the front. Severity is usually lower than a head-on collision, since it tends to be a glancing blow rather than a direct impact. However, loss of control of either vehicle can have unpredictable effects and secondary crashes can dramatically increase the expected crash severity.\n\n"}

They are also referred to more briefly as just symmetric forms when \"bilinear\" is understood.\n\nSymmetric bilinear forms on finite-dimensional vector spaces precisely correspond to symmetric matrices given a basis for \"V\". Among bilinear forms, the symmetric ones are important because they are the ones for which the vector space admits a particularly simple kind of basis known as an orthogonal basis (at least when the characteristic of the field is not 2).\n\nGiven a symmetric bilinear form \"B\", the function is the associated quadratic form on the vector space.

In 1915, a butter factory opened.\n\nCooroy railway station was opened in 1891 and in the same year a post office opened. A town survey was conducted in 1907.\n\nCooroy State School opened in 1909. Cooroy West State School opened in 1911 but closed in 1962.\n\nOn 23 January 1961 a secondary department was added to Cooroy State School until the Cooroy State High School was opened as a separate school on 23 January 1963. In 1967 it became Noosa District State High School. In 2007, it was Cooroora Secondary College at Pomona which was merged into Noosa District State High School, with the Pomona campus being used for the younger students and Cooroy campus being used for the older students.\n\nNoosa Christian College opened on 28 January 2003 as a primary school with 37 students. In 2007 it expanded to offer secondary classes.\n\nThe town was bisected by the Bruce Highway until a bypass was built in 1994.\n\nThe Cooroy Library opened in 2010.\n\nCooroy has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nCooroy has one hotel, a library, a police station, a golf club, a bowls club, the RSL club and sub branch, a selection of cafes and restaurants, unique retail outlets and a range of accommodation options. Noosa Botanical Gardens is situated on Lake MacDonald just outside the town and several of the Noosa Trails are accessible in Cooroy. An RV parking area has opened adjacent to the town sewerage works.\n\nThe Shire of Noosa operates a library at 9 Maple Street.\nIn 1991 Noosa Shire Council purchased former Butter Factory buildings for use as a community centre.\n\n\nThe Cooroy branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the Cooroy Memorial Hall & School of Arts at 23 Maple Street.\n\nCooroy State School is a primary (P-6) school for boys and girls operated by the Queensland Government at 59 Elm Street. In 2016, the school had an enrolment of 545 students with 40 teachers (34 full-time equivalent) and 24 non-teaching staff (15 full-time equivalent).\n\nNoosa District State High School is a secondary (7-12) school for boys and girls operated by the Queendland Government over two campuses, one at 120 Summit Road, Pomona, for Years 7-8 and the other at Tulip Street in Cooroy for Years 9-12. In 2016, the school had a total enrolment of 1335 students with 111 teachers (106 full-time equivalent) and 48 non-teaching staff (40 full-time equivalent).\n\nNoosa Christian College is a primary and secondary school (P-12) for boys and girls operated by Adventist Schools Australia at 20 Cooroy Belli Creek Road.

{"id": "1803389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803389", "title": "Transgender in China", "text": "Transgender in China\n\nTransgender is an overarching term to describe persons whose gender identity/expression differs from what is typically associated with the gender they were assigned at birth.\n\"Transgender Studies\" was institutionalized as an academic discipline in the 1990s so it is difficult to apply transgender to Chinese culture in a historical context. There were no transgender groups or communities in Hong Kong until after the turn of the century. Today they are still known as a \"sexual minority\" in China.\n\nBecause Chinese transgender studies is so unfocused, a wide variety of terms are used in relation to transgender in the varieties of Chinese.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there are specific derogatory terms used towards transgender people. The most common is \"jan-jiu\" (人妖) which translates to \"human monster\".\n\nTerms for crossdressing are many and varied. 異裝癖 (py yìzhūangpǐ), literally \"obsession with the opposite [sex's] attire\", is commonly used. 扮裝 (py bànzhūang), literally \"to put on attire\", is commonly used to mean crossdressing. Related to this is an auxiliary term for drag queens: 扮裝皇后 (py bànzhūang húanghòu), or \"crossdressing queen\". There are several terms competing as translations of the English drag king, but none has reached currency yet. While research shows that China's younger population is much more accepting of transgender people, offensive terminology like \"jan-jim\" or \"bin-sing-Jan\" is very common.\n\nIn the mid 1930s, after the father of Yao Jinping (姚錦屏) went missing during the war with Japan, the 19-year-old reported having lost all feminine traits and become a man, was said to have an Adam's apple and flattened breasts, and left to find him. Du He, who wrote an account of the event, insisted Yao had become a man, while doctors asserted Yao was female. The story was widely reported in the press, and Yao has been compared to both Lili Elbe, who underwent sex reassignment in the same decade.\n\nSinologists often look to theatrical arts when imaging China in a transgender frame because of the prominent presence of cross-gender behavior.\n\nPeking Opera, also known as Beijing Opera, had male actors playing female \"dan\" characters. Men traditionally played women's roles due to women being excluded from performing in front of the public. Although, before 1978, male to female cross dressing was mostly for theatrical performances, used for comedic effect or to disguise a character in order to commit a crime or defeat enemies. Female to male characters were considered heroic in theatrical performances.\n\nWithin the Ming and Qing Dynasties of China, there was a lot of cross dressing and transgender practices occurring both onstage and in everyday life. Within the theatre, elite men were intrigued by it. They would role-play, organize their own troupes, write and perform theatrical pieces.\n\nMany of early modern China's stories reflected cross-dressing and living the life of a different gender for a short period of time, mainly featuring the cross-dressers as virtuous, like Mulan.\n\nLi Yu, a writer and entrepreneur, featured the gendering of bodies to be dependent upon men's desires and operated by a system of gender dimorphism, assumed by social boundaries of the time. When Li Yu created an acting troupe, as many elite males did, he had a concubine that played a male role as he believed she was \"suited to male\" or considered her more of the masculine gender.\n\nIn modern-day Peking Opera and film, there are male to female cross dressers and vice versa for characters, especially with certain time periods.\n\nSex and gender were arguably fluid within the late Ming and early Qing dynasties as many female infants were forced into sex changes to be males. This, in turn, affected those children into living transgender lives, whether through physical transformation or—if there were not a sex change—continuous cross-dressing.\n\nIn 2009 the Chinese government made it illegal for minors to change their officially-listed gender, stating that sexual reassignment surgery, available to only those over the age of twenty, was required in order to apply for a revision of their identification card and residence registration.\n\nIn early 2014 the Shanxi province started allowing minors to apply for the change with the additional information of their guardian's identification card. This shift in policy allows post-surgery marriages to be recognized as heterosexual and therefore legal.\n\nThe first recorded gay and lesbian community began to develop in the early 1990 in Beijing, however homosexuality was a relatively sensitive topic until the early 2000s. The introduction of the internet in 1998 allowed for a convenient medium for LGBT activists to connect and communicate. Online chatrooms were a great resource for grassroots LGBT organizations. In addition to the internet, the presence of LGBT communities in China developed very quickly due to outbreak, spread, and subsequent international and government funding for HIV/AIDS prevention. In 1996, AIDS-related funds from the government were just over $500,000 but by 2001 this figured reached nearly $10 million annually. The AIDS public health crisis remains one of the most influential variables for the rise of LGBT groups worldwide. However this funding was mostly focused on gay groups so other sexual minorities groups have developed slower in comparison.\n\nThe Beijing LGBT Center (Beijing Tongzhi Zhongxin) is primarily composed of four organizations: Aizhixing AIDS Organization, Tongyu Lala Organization, Aibai Cultural and Education Center, and Les+. Tongyu Lala is an organization based in Beijing that combats discrimination against and is an advocate for social inclusion of lesbians, bisexual women, and transgender people. The group also helps organize LGBT groups in China.\n\nThere are a number of important events that focus on promoting LGBT rights and equally in China including the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, the Beijing Queer Film Festival, and gay pride parades held in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (see Hong Kong Pride Parade and Shanghai Pride).\n\nInside the LGBT movement in China the gay moment is dominant while other sexual minorities have historically been relegated. On 11 December 2011, a group calling themselves \"Pretty Fighters\" issued a manifesto proclaiming, \"We are lalas. We are queer. We want to speak out.\" This controversy started when the Aibai organization (a major LGBT group in China) made claims that homosexuality is inborn and that queer theory, which upholds the possibility of plurality in sexual desire, was harmful to the LGBT movement. This debate eventually led to the lesbian movement declaring independence from the gay movement. “The Pretty Fighter Debate” was a major event for the LGBT movement within China because it hailed the lack of gender awareness in China, marked the independence of the lesbian movement, and defined \"queer lala\" as inclusive of other sexual mores including transgender individuals.\n\nConfucianism, one of the dominant religions in China, enforces and promotes traditional gender roles. Confucianism has a strong belief in maintaining men's dominance over women and trans women are therefore viewed as shameful for expressing a lower status.\n\nBuddhism views all bodily concerns as entrapment in the Samsara, equally including those concerns regarding LGBT+ identities and issues.\n\nThe attitudes of younger generations that have been less exposed to Maoist ideologies are beginning to reflect more accepting attitudes towards members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nTransgender youth in China face many challenges. One study found that Chinese parents report 0.5% (1:200) of their 6 to 12-year boys and 0.6% (1:167) of girls often or always ‘state the wish to be the other gender’. 0.8% (1.125) of 18- to 24-year-old university students who are birth-assigned males (whose sex/gender as indicated on their ID card is male) report that the ‘sex/gender I feel in my heart’ is female, while another 0.4% indicating that their perceived gender was ‘other’. Among birth-assigned females, 2.9% (1:34) indicated they perceived their gender as male, while another 1.3% indicating ‘other’.\n\nOne transgender man recounts his childhood as one filled with confusion and peer bullying. In school he was mocked for being a tomboy and was regularly disciplined by teachers for displaying rowdy boy-like behavior. Some recommended to his parents that he be institutionalized.\n\nThese attitudes may be slowly changing and many Chinese youth are able to live happy and well-adjusted lives as members of the LGBT+ community in modern China. In July 2012 the BBC reported that the new open economy has led to more freedom of sexual expression in China.\n\nLiterature and plays in the 17th century featured cross-dressing, like Ming dramatist Xu Wei who wrote \"Female Mulan Takes Her Father’s Place in the Army\" and \"The Female Top Candidate Rejects a Wife and Receives a Husband\". Despite the female to male cross dressing, the woman would eventually return to her socially gendered roles of wearing women's clothes and would marry a man.\n\nTechnological advancements help to promote greater awareness among youth of LGBT+ issues. Access to Western media, such as movies, trans-identifying characters, as well as trans-themed web sites are broadening the knowledge and sense of community many trans youth seek.\n\nEntertainers:\n\nModels:\n\nCitizens:\n\nThe flowing Chinese films portray transgender characters:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1803394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803394", "title": "Real Men of Genius", "text": "Real Men of Genius\n\nReal Men of Genius is a series of advertisements, primarily 60-second American radio spots, for Bud Light beer. The campaign was originally conceived by copywriter Bob Winter and art director Mark Gross and co-created with copywriter Bill Cimino at DDB Chicago.\n\nThe campaign began in 1998 under the title Real American Heroes with 12 radio spots. Over 200 installments have been made. In 2001, the radio version was adapted for television in the UK, advertising Budweiser beer instead of Bud Light (Bud Light is not officially distributed in the UK). The six UK TV spots maintained the same one-minute format and ran for about 18 months. In fall 2003, thirty-second versions of three UK TV spots were edited and seven new ads were produced for US television.\n\nAnheuser-Busch is reported to have spent $38 million per year airing just the radio version.\n\nThe singing was done by Dave Bickler, the lead singer of the band Survivor, known for such songs as \"Eye of the Tiger\" from the 1980s.\nThe humorous, yet seriously spoken, commentary was done by voice actor Peter Stacker.\nTogether, they made an appearance on the television show \"WGN Morning News\" and did a Real Men of Genius about the cameraman, which was a parody saying he falls asleep behind the video camera while recording the show.\n\nEach sixty-second ad gives mock glorification in the form of a tribute to men in overlooked professions or with humorous or eccentric traits or habits. The language is very observational in style, in part parodying Budweiser's earlier \"This Bud's for You\" campaign.\n\nThe advertisement is set to 1980s style anthemic music. The announcer (Pete Stacker) reads the mock tribute straight. Humour in part is derived from juxtaposing over-the-top vocals sung by Dave Bickler. Sometimes these vocals are augmented by a female gospel-style chorus.\n\nIn addition to providing humor, the music is an effective jingle.\n\nIn mid-2001, Anheuser-Busch ordered another 17 \"Real American Hero\" ads be made. These ads were pulled from circulation after the 9/11 attacks as mocking American heroism then seemed questionable. The campaign relaunched in 2002 with the title and lyrics changed from \"Real American Heroes\" to \"Real Men of Genius\".\n\nAnheuser-Busch were initially reluctant to air the ads because of their irreverent style. Consumer testing, however, proved them to be very popular.\n\nThe ads not only received tremendous consumer response, but also won more than 100 awards, including the prestigious Grand Prix for Radio (twice, in 2005 and 2006) as well as Gold and Bronze Lions at the Cannes International Advertising Festival and, in 2003, a Grand Clio, making it the most awarded campaign in history.\n\nThe popularity of the series led to many of the commercials being traded on peer-to-peer file sharing networks and bootleg recordings of the ads being sold on eBay.\n\nIn 2003, Anheuser-Busch released a collection of 20 ads on CD, titled \"Bud Light Salutes Real Men of Genius, Vol 1\", to be sold in the company's online store. Two additional volumes were released soon after. In 2005, a limited edition compilation combined all prior volumes into one release, \"Bud Light Salutes Real Men of Genius Volumes 1, 2 and 3\". Each volume contained 20 spots and have since gone out of print.\n\nIn late 2006, Anheuser-Busch sponsored a comedy tour titled \"Real Men of Comedy\" starring John Heffron, Joe Rogan, and Charlie Murphy. This tour featured the announcer (Stacker) and singer (Bickler) performing several of their famous commercials live at the beginning of the show. Stacker and Bickler performed regional versions of the spots to support Budweiser's comedy tour at radio stations and concert-sponsored venues such as Lollapalooza.\n\nWhile never officially canceled, funding for the ads was cut in June 2008. At the time, Anheuser-Busch denied the cost savings were part of a defense against hostile takeover from then-competitor InBev. In July 2008, InBev successfully purchased Anheuser Busch.\n\nOn June 18th, 2019, Anheuser-Busch InBev resurrected a new version of the ad campaign for the social media age called Internet Heroes of Genius, which will run on streaming audio platforms. The new series was created by Red Interactive, a division of Endeavor Global Marketing, and the brewer’s in-house agency, Draftline, and feature Brandon Beilis (singing) and Dave Steele (VO).\n"}
{"id": "1803422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803422", "title": "Passionists", "text": "Passionists\n\nThe Passionists, formally known as the Congregation of the Passion of Jesus Christ (, C.P.), are a Catholic religious order of Pontifical Right founded by Saint Paul of the Cross with a special emphasis on and devotion to the Passion of Jesus Christ. Professed members use the initials \"C.P.\" after their names. A known symbol of the congregation is the labeled emblem of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, surmounted by a cross and is often sewn into the clothing attire of its congregants. The present superior general is Father Joachim Rego C.P.\n\nSt. Paul of the Cross wrote the rules of the Congregation in December 1720, and in June 1725 Pope Benedict XIII granted Paul the permission to form his congregation. Paul and his brother, Jean-Baptiste, were ordained by the pope on the same occasion (7 June). The full canonical title of the congregation, following the revision of their Constitutions approved by the Holy See in 1984, is The Congregation of the Passion of Jesus Christ.\n\nAfter serving for a time in the hospital of St. Gallicano, in 1737 they left Rome with permission of the Pope and went to Mount Argentario, where they established the first house of the institute. They took up their abode in a small hermitage near the summit of the mount, to which was attached a chapel dedicated to St. Anthony. They were soon joined by three companions, one of whom was a priest, and the observance of community life according to the rules began there and is continued there to the present day.\nSt. Paul of the Cross and his companions – they now totalled six priests and two brothers – began a retreat. On 11 June 1741 they first affixed the emblem or \"sign\" of the Passion (Jesu XPI Passio) on their black tunics. The professed renewed their vows, and the new members pronounced their first vows.\n\nIn 1769, Clement XIV granted full rights to the Passionists as enjoyed by the other religious institutes, making them not an order but a congregation. The congregation historically has had two primary goals: Preaching Missions and contemplative life, with an attempt to blend the two. Its founder had attempted to combine aspects of the contemplative orders, such as the Trappist monks, together with the dynamic orders, such as the Jesuits. \n\n\"We seek the unity of our lives and our apostolate in the Passion of Jesus.\" The Passionate express their participation in the Passion by a special vow, by which they bind themselves to keep alive the memory of the Passion of Christ. They strive to foster awareness of its meaning and value for each person and for the life of the world. They seek to incorporate this vow into our daily lives by living the evangelical counsels.\n\nTraditionally, their main apostolate has been preaching missions and retreats. According to Saint Paul of the Cross, they were founded in order to \"teach people how to pray\", which they do through activities such as retreats and missions, spiritual direction, and prayer groups. Today they often also assist local churches in pastoral works, including saying masses, hearing confessions, and visiting the sick. Due to the continuing shortage of priests throughout the world, the Passionists today are sometimes designated as parish priests and curates of various parishes. The Passionists hold many retreat and conference centers around the world.\n\nUnlike the La Sallians or the Gabrielites, Passionists do not usually open schools and universities, except seminaries for their own students wishing to become brothers and priests. There are some schools sponsored and run by the Passionists, like the St. Gemma Galgani School, (which includes primary, junior high and high school-level education) in Santiago (Chile), but these are more the exception than the rule. The Passionists are involved in social welfare projects and education mainly in the various mission territories assigned to them.\n\nThough Passionists are not required to work in non-Christian areas as missionaries, their Rule allows its members to be posted to missionary work, such as mainland China (before the Communists took over in 1949), India, and Japan, and in many other nations in Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere as dictated by the pope or at the invitation of a local Bishop.\n\nThere are 2,179 Passionists in 61 countries on the five continents, led by a superior general who is elected every six years. He is assisted by six consultors in governing the congregation. The congregation is divided into provinces, vice-provinces and missions. The Congregation is also divided into groups of provinces, vice-provinces and missions called configurations. The presidents of the six configurations constitute the Extended General Council which meets with the Superior General and his consultors annually.\nThere are six configurations in the world:\n\n\nThe official name of the institute is \"The Congregation of the Passion of Jesus Christ\". The superior general resides in Rome (Piazza Ss. Giovanni e Paolo, 13, 00184 Roma; tel. 06 772711). The founder is buried in a chapel attached to the Basilica of Saints John and Paul, and the General Headquarters also hosts an international house of studies for Passionists from around the world.\n\nPassionist monasteries are referred to as “retreats”. The members of the congregation are not allowed to possess land, and the congregation collectively can only own the community house and a bit of land attached to it. They rely completely on their own labor and on contributions from the faithful in order to maintain themselves financially. The habit worn by members is a rough wool tunic bearing the words \"Jesu XPI Passio\", meaning \"Passion of Jesus Christ\" and the congregation was historically discalced, wearing sandals rather than shoes.\n\nWith regard to Popular Piety, the Congregation is also known for promoting devotion to the Passion among the faithful by the use of Black Scapulars usually worn by aspirants to the Passionist way of life. Different devotional practices such as Confraternities of the Passion, Devotion to the Five Wounds of Christ, The Seven Sorrows of The Blessed Virgin Mary, Stations of the Cross and various forms of the Office in honour of the Passion are still widely promoted among its members.\n\nCanonised members of the Congregation \n\nBeatified members of the Congregation\n\nIn addition, the causes for the canonisation of Father Carl Schmitz, Father Ignatius Spencer, Father Theodore Foley and Elizabeth Prout have been opened.\n\n\nThe Passionist Sisters (the Sisters of the Cross and Passion) is an institute founded in 1852 by Father Gaudentius Rossi, an early Passionist priest, in collaboration with Elizabeth Prout. In its beginnings, it was called \"Sisters of the Holy Family\", and was later included under the Passionist family. \n\nDue to their separate raisings guided by members of the congregation, Saints Maria Goretti and Gemma Galgani are traditionally counted in the ranks of the Passionist Sisters, even though they died before they could formally enter the institute (Maria was murdered, Gemma died of tuberculosis).\n\n"}
{"id": "1803446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803446", "title": "Turki bin Faisal Al Saud", "text": "Turki bin Faisal Al Saud\n\nTurki bin Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud () (born 15 February 1945), known also as Turki al-Faisal, is a Saudi politician and diplomat. A member of the House of Saud, he currently serves as the chairman of King Faisal Foundation's Center for Research and Islamic Studies.\n\nFrom 1977 to 2001, Prince Turki was the director general of Al Mukhabarat Al 'Ammah, Saudi Arabia's intelligence agency, resigning the position on 1 September 2001, some ten days before the September 11 attacks in which 14 Saudi nationals hijacked commercial American airliners. Prince Turki subsequently served as ambassador to the Court of St. James's and the United States.\n\nPrince Turki was born on 15 February 1945 in Mecca. He is the eighth and youngest son of the late Saudi Arabian King Faisal and Iffat Al-Thunayyan who was born to a Turkish family and died on 17 February 2000. He is full-brother of Mohammed bin Faisal, Saud bin Faisal, Luluwah bint Faisal and Haifa bint Faisal.\n\nTurki bin Faisal received his primary and some secondary education at a school in Taif built by his parents. When he was fourteen, his father sent him to Lawrenceville, New Jersey to complete his secondary education at the Lawrenceville School, from which he graduated in 1963. He then attended the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, part of class of 1968 (alongside future U.S. President Bill Clinton). Turki also did further studies at Princeton, Cambridge, and the University of London, where he took courses in Islamic law and jurisprudence.\n\nAfter returning to the Kingdom, Turki was appointed an adviser in the Royal Court in 1973.\n\nPrince Turki began his political career as deputy to his uncle, Kamal Adham, and then, his successor as the head of Saudi Arabia's Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah (General Intelligence Directorate), a position he held for 23 years—from 1979 until just 10 days before the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\nTurki claimed that in the months before the September 11 attacks, his intelligence agency knew that something alarming was being planned: “In the summer of 2001, I took one of the warnings about something spectacular about to happen to the Americans, British, French and Arabs. We didn’t know where, but we knew that something was being brewed.” \n\nHe took part in organizing a military operation to remove the hostage-taking terrorists from Masjid al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque) in Mecca during the Grand Mosque Seizure in November–December 1979. Prince Turki's resignation was unexpected since his term had been extended on 24 May 2001 for another four years. He was replaced just ten days before 9/11, on 1 September 2001, by Nawaf bin Abdul Aziz, his uncle and the king’s brother, who had \"no background in intelligence whatsoever.\" \"The Wall Street Journal\" later reports: \"The timing of Turki’s removal—August 31—and his Taliban connection raise the question: Did the Saudi regime know that bin Laden was planning his attack against the US?\"\n\nAfter King Fahd's stroke in 1995, Prince Turki had a minor disagreement with Prince Abdullah, who did not want to be briefed by him.\n\nSaudi intelligence joined Pakistan's intelligence service and the CIA in funding the mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan. Turki last met with Osama bin Laden in early 1990, when bin Laden was interested in aiding against the South Yemen communists. His intelligence agency kept careful track of bin Laden from the beginning of his rise.\n\nIn 1993, Turki helped mediate between warring factions in Afghanistan. In early 1996, Sudan offered to extradite bin Laden to Saudi Arabia. Clinton called on Turki to bring bin Laden back to Saudi Arabia for a quick execution. Saudi Arabia denied the request and Osama left Sudan for Afghanistan.\n\nA continued connection to bin Laden was falsely claimed by \"Paris Match\" magazine. In December 2004, Turki accepted substantial libel damages and an apology from the magazine \"Paris Match\" over claims he himself was linked to the 11 September attacks. \n\nIn 2002, Prince Turki was named in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit by the families of 11 September victims, alleging that he and other Saudi princes, banks, and charities may have funded the terrorists involved in the attack. His involvement was also strongly implied in the Michael Moore documentary \"Fahrenheit 911\". A reporter for the Baltimore Chronicle claimed he was flown out of the United States shortly after the terrorist attacks, but the claim disappeared from later versions of the article. Prince Turki described \"Fahrenheit 911\" as \"grossly unfair\" to Saudis.\n\nPrince Turki maintains that he had no contact with bin Laden since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. He claims to have secretly negotiated with Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar in 1998 in an attempt to have bin Laden extradited to Saudi Arabia, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. In a November 2001 interview, Turki expressed support for the US operation in Afghanistan against the Taliban and al-Qaeda.In 2005, a US federal judge ruled that Saudi officials including Turki were immune from the lawsuit. Turki has severely criticized al-Qaeda, calling it an \"evil cult.\"\n\nHowever, the allegations continue to dog Turki, with a court affidavit filed on 3 February 2015, claiming that Zacarias Moussaoui served as a courier between bin Laden and Turki in the late 1990s, long after Turki claims to have broken off his relationship with bin Laden. The Saudi government continues to deny any involvement, and claims there is no evidence to support Moussaoui's allegations, noting that Moussaoui's own lawyers presented evidence of his mental incompetence during his trial.\n\nPrince Turki bin Abdulaziz bin Faisal Al Saud was appointed ambassador to the Court of Saint James's in London, and to Ireland, from January 2003. He served as ambassador until 2005 and was well respected by British diplomats.\n\nIn July 2005, it was announced that Prince Turki would succeed Bandar bin Sultan as Saudi ambassador to the United States. He served as ambassador to the United States from July 2005 until 11 December 2006. Adel al-Jubeir succeeded him as ambassador to the United States.\n\nPrince Turki spent much of his time as ambassador to the United States traveling around the country, visiting 37 states. Turki advocated that the United States engage in direct talks with Iran but other high-ranking Saudi officials, including Turki's predecessor as ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, supported military action to halt Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program.\n\nHe argued that the Palestinian-Israeli issue, not Iran, was more important for the United States and called on the Bush Administration to revive the peace process. He also argued that diplomacy with Iran was the best way to prevent problems. The Administration disliked his stance and made it difficult for him to arrange visits to the White House. The White House preferred Bandar's more aggressive approach and welcomed Bandar instead.\n\nPrince Bandar's visits to the White House undermined Prince Turki and Prince Turki's goal of engaging in public diplomacy was weakened because of a shortage of money to fund the embassy and his public relations program. On the other hand, there were internal disputes over the Saudi Arabia’s Iraq policy, leading to tensions between Prince Turki and senior members of the royal family.\n\nTurki was angered by the fact that when his own king had asked then Vice President Dick Cheney to meet at short notice in Riyadh, Turki was not invited to attend – an unusual omission for Saudi summit meetings. In addition, Turki's brother Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al Faisal did not write the post-summit briefing for Turki; Bandar did.\n\nKing Abdullah is reported to have preferred Bandar bin Sultan as the King's intermediary between Riyadh and Washington D.C. Turki's resignation may have been in protest. He abruptly resigned in early December 2006 after 15 months as an ambassador. His predecessor, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, worked in the same post for 22 years. Prince Turki returned in January 2007 after the Hajj Pilgrimage to formally announce his departure. Some analysts claim he intentionally attracted attention. He said he wanted to spend time with family. His resignation was initially reported by \"The Washington Post\", not by the royal court or official sources. Turki retired from public office in February 2007.\n\nShortly after the passing of King Faisal, Prince Turki and his siblings established the King Faisal Foundation to invest in education in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs chairman of King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, Prince Turki compared energy independence in American politics to baby-kissing. He stated that American politicians must be courageous against demagoguery. He lauded his country's efforts in education and believes that Saudis can succeed only through education. He visited India in December 2011.\n\nPrince Turki directly challenged Sheikh Abdullah al Turki, secretary general of the World Muslim League and a member of the Council of Senior Ulema after 9/11 attacks, arguing that \"those responsible for affairs of state are the rulers,\" whereas religious scholars \"only act in an advisory capacity.\" On 15 October 2001, Turki, writing in \"Alsharq Alawsat\", stated \"God help us from Satan. You [Osama bin Laden] are a rotten seed like the son of Noah, ... and the flood will engulf you like it engulfed him.\" In interview on Saudi TV on 5 November 2001, Turki argued \"The religious edicts issued by [bin Laden] are the main evidence [for his guilt] because they call for attacking American soldiers and civilians. Only those people devoid of feelings will still ask for evidence. ... Those who still call for evidence are closing their eyes to the facts and are searching for justification of [bin Laden's] acts.\"\n\nPrince Turki criticized equating jihad with acts of terrorism by citing the resistance against Soviets in the 1980s. He disapproved of the Obama Administration's shunning of Hamid Karzai and believed Abdullah Abdullah was not an acceptable candidate to Afghanistan's diverse ethnic groups – namely, the Pashtuns and Uzbeks. He also called for a shift in U.S. strategy from the media theme against the Taliban to a more focused propaganda campaign against Al Qaeda. He voiced his urgency to the immediate resolution of the Durand Line between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He wants Afghan people to handle their own problems. He also expects the U.S. will continue to experience resistance as long as it stays in Afghanistan.\n\nOn Iran, Prince Turki warned of its growing influence in Lebanon as \"foreign hands manipulating strings.\" Asked what he thought would be the consequences of an Israeli or U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, Prince Turki responded, \"Calamitous … cataclysmic, not just catastrophic.\" On the Iranian nuclear program, he believes that there should be a zone free of weapons of mass destruction. He believes Iranian actions have provoked worldwide opposition but at the same time suggests that Iran's nuclear program is being singled out. He believes Iran is pursuing an \"explosive\" path in nuclear enrichment. He stated if Iran was attacked Saudi Arabia would never grant Israeli flyover rights.\nHe called the Geneva interim agreement a serious concern and condemned the United States for keeping the Government of Saudi Arabia away from the negotiations in Geneva.\n\nTurki al-Faisal has expressed support for the dissident group Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK/PMOI).\n\nPrince Turki stated that Yemen has become a sanctuary for extremists as refugees flee the conflict and into the Kingdom's borders.\n\nPrince Turki was the Kingdom's leading critic of American foreign policy. Prince Turki criticized Israel for not accepting the Arab Peace Initiative, which proposed normalizing relations in exchange for Israel's withdrawal to 1967 borders. He accused the Bush administration for undermining a Saudi-brokered power-sharing agreement between Fatah and Hamas and the Obama administration of pro-Israel bias and protecting Israel's nuclear program from international scrutiny. He called on U.S. President Barack Obama to support the two-state solution for Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nIn a \"Financial Times\" editorial in January 2009, he was critical of American foreign policy toward Palestinians and accused the U.S. of complicity in the deaths of Gazans. He opined that \"neocon advisers, American conservatives and Zionist extremists promoted policies that harmed the peace process,\" describing both Democrats and Republicans as strong supporters of Israel.\n\nAt the Munich Security Conference in February 2010, he initially refused to sit next to Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon because of Ayalon's \"boorish\" behavior toward the Turkish ambassador on Israeli television. In response to Ayalon's comment that Saudi Arabia had not \"given a penny\" to the Palestinian Authority, Prince Turki claimed that it had given more than $500 million over the past five years. Ayalon apologized and shook hands with Prince Turki as a reconciliation measure. The crowd applauded. Turki clarified that this gesture did not signal any change in official policy towards Israel.\nIn the World Economic Forum at Davos in January 2011, he called for a Middle East without WMDs and stated \"the elephant in the room is Israel. Israel with a nuclear weapon is dangerous.\"\n\nAfter attending the Munich Security Conference in January 2014, Faisal praised Israel's justice minister, Tzipi Livni and said he understood why she was chosen as Israel's negotiator.\n\nPrince Turki claimed the documents \"are a hodgepodge of selectivity, inaccuracy, agenda pursuit, and downright disinformation.\" He claimed if diplomats and leaders were not able to discuss matters that affect them through cables freely, the countries are \"in trouble\". He added that WikiLeaks poses a serious danger to all governments and called for meting out tough punishment for those responsible for the breach.\n\nAround 2003, Prince Turki said that \"reforming the Kingdom is not a choice, it is a necessity\".\n\nIn late March 2011, Prince Turki argued that elections for membership to the Saudi Shoura Council (the national majlis) should be realized and warned of a \"failure in the Kingdom's job market\".\n\nPrince Turki dismissed the CIA's finding that Jamal Khashoggi's murder was ordered directly by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying that \"The CIA has been proved wrong before. Just to mention the invasion of Iraq for example. The CIA is not necessarily the best measure of creditable intelligence reporting or intelligence assessment.\" \n\nPrince Turki bin Faisal is a commissioner in the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. He is deputy chairman of Saudi General Authority for Civil Aviation (GACA). He is also vice president of general authority of civil aviation for international organizations and was elected as first vice president of the regional bureau of Asia-Pacific within airports council international.\n\nHe taught at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. He is also a co-chair of the C100 Group, an affiliate of the World Economic Forum. C-100 Group encourages interfaith dialogue and cross-cultural understanding.\n\nHe visited many American universities and has lectured on the history of Saudi Arabia to improve relations between the West and Saudi Arabia. He also visited the University of South Florida, Syracuse University, Rice University, Cornell University, and Harvard University. In November 2010, he spoke at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nPrince Turki acts as one of the top speakers of the Kingdom.\n\nPrince Turki is married to Nouf bint Fahd bin Khalid Al Saud, with whom he has six children: Faisal, Mashael, Noura, Abdulaziz, Saud, and Mudhi. His son Prince Abdulaziz won the second round of the Porsche Middle East Cup. His daughter Princess Noura is assistant to vice chairman of the board of trustees and general supervisor of Effat College and Dar Al Hanan School. At a University of South Florida event, he mentioned he has grandchildren and they sometimes ask him questions about Islam.\n\nIn person, Prince Turki has been described as the antithesis of Bandar bin Sultan. Prince Turki has been described as cool-headed, soft-spoken, and avuncular. He is one of the most educated Saudi princes.\n\nPrince Turki has problems resulting from the carbon-monoxide poisoning suffered when staying in a camper van on a desert trip in the mid-1980s.\n\nPrince Turki is the recipient of the Crans Montana Forum medal.\nPrince Turki also received an honorary doctorate in law from the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland in 2010 and an honorary doctorate in Middle Eastern studies from Shanghai International Studies University (SISU) in China in 2015.\n\n"}

The European name of Cape Dorset was given by Captain Luke Fox after Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset, on September 24, 1631. The Inuit originally called the inlet \"Sikusiilaq\", after the area of sea ocean nearby that remains ice-free all winter. Hudson's Bay Company set up a trading post here in 1913, where they traded furs and skins for supplies such as tobacco, ammunition, flour, gas, tea and sugar.\n\nIn December 2019, the residents of Cape Dorset voted in favour of a request to officially rename the hamlet to its Inuktitut name of Kinngait. Voters chose between Kinngait, Sikusilaq, and the English name of Cape Dorset.\n\nSince the 1950s, Kinngait, which calls itself the \"Capital of Inuit Art\", has been a centre for drawing, printmaking, and carving. In the 21st century, printmaking and carving continue to be the community's main economic activities. Each year, Kinngait Studios issues an annual print collection. Kinngait has been hailed as the most artistic community in Canada, with some 22% of the labour force employed in the arts.\n\nIn 1957, James Archibald Houston created a graphic arts workshop in Kinngait, in a program sponsored by the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources. It was considered a way for the community to generate income by adapting traditional art forms to contemporary techniques. Houston collected drawings from community artists and encouraged local Inuit stone carvers to apply their skills to stone-block printing, in order to create art that might be more widely sold and distributed. The print program was modeled after Japanese ukiyo-e workshops. Other cooperative print shops were established in nearby communities, but the Kinngait workshop has remained the most successful. The artists have experimented with etching, engraving, lithography, and silkscreen. They produce annual catalogs advertising the limited edition prints.\n\nBetween the years of 1959 and 1974, Kinngait artists produced more than 48,000 prints. Well-known artists of Kinngait include Pitseolak Ashoona, Nuna Parr, Pudlo Pudlat, Angotigolu Teevee, Alashua Aningmiuq, Kiugak Ashoona, Ulayu Pingwartok, Oopik Pitsuilak, Innukjuakju Pudlat, Mary Qayuaryuk, Anirnik Oshuitoq, and Kenojuak Ashevak. Parr's carvings are internationally recognized and his work is exhibited in the National Gallery of Canada. Ashevak's drawings of owls have been chosen to appear on Canadian stamps as well as a Canadian quarter.\n\nInuit carver, artist, photographer and author Peter Pitseolak spent several years living in Kinngait. The local junior-senior high school was named for him.\n\nBelow is a list of some of the artists from Kinngait, according to the Inuit Art Foundation.\n\nAs of the 2016 census, the population was 1,411, an increase of 5.7% from the 2006 census.\n\nA handful of unnamed dirt/gravel roads (unpaved because of winter conditions) cross the village but do not connect beyond Kinngait. Cars and trucks are the main means of transportation and supplemented by snowmobiles and ATVs (all-terrain vehicles) during the winter. The people use boats and ships for seasonal travel to and from Kinngait when the Hudson Strait is ice-free. A taxi company, Tuniit Taxis, offer a range of vehicles.\n\nThe area is serviced by the Cape Dorset Airport with connections only within Nunavut. Travel outside Nunavut can be made via connections through Iqaluit Airport.\n\nThe only secondary school in town, Peter Pitseolak School (PPS), was destroyed by fire set by three youths in September 2015. In summer 2019, the school opened a printmaking studio workshop space for children, through the Embassy of Imagination program.\n\nSam Pudlat School is the community's only elementary school; it has enrollment of 227 students. Attendance is good at the elementary school but quite poor at the high school.\n\nPost-secondary education is available in a limited number of areas in Kinngait at the Community Learning Centre. Nunavut Arctic College, based in Iqaluit, periodically offers community-based programs in Kinngait at the Community Learning Centre.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police has a detachment staffed by four officers and sometimes number as many as six officers with one corporal.\n\nThe Fire Department is staffed by 25 volunteers and a pumper at a single fire hall. There is a lack of fire hydrants in the town, so each run has to be filled up at the water station.\nMedical facilities are basic at the Cape Dorset Health Centre. Advanced medical care requires an airlift to the 35-bed Qikiqtani General Hospital in Iqaluit. There is no ambulance in the town. Qualified doctors visit only occasionally. There is a taxi service but it is not consistently reliable.\n\nThe community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSI Micro. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.\n\nNo new family dwellings have been built in more than 10 years, so houses are overcrowded with as many as 17 people living in small quarters. TB or tuberculosis is active in the town. This is made more acutely dangerous as the overcrowding continues.\n\nThe cost of basic food staples like milk, cheese, flour, butter is 65-75% higher than in Ottawa or Montreal.\n\nSpanning both Dorset Island and Mallik Island, Mallikjuaq Territorial Park is notable for archaeological sites revealing Thule culture, Dorset culture, and Inuit history. The park is reachable by foot from Kinngait at low tide, or by boat. \nA cairn was raised in memory of the ship, \"RMS Nascopie\", that hit rock and sank in 1947. It was a supply ship to the Arctic. Although the cargo was lost, the passengers and crew were saved.\n\nIn September 2018, the Kenokuak Cultural Centre and Print Shop opened. The centre is named after local artist and Inuit art pioneer Kenojuak Ashevak who died in 2013. The centre serves a community facility, art studio and exhibition space for local artists.\n\nThere are outfitters that provide numerous dog sledding, camping, and hiking to parks tours.\n\n"}

He won the Stanley Cup in 2009 as a director of player development with the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nFitzgerald played his high school hockey at Austin Preparatory School in Reading, Massachusetts, he then went on to play college hockey for Providence College and was selected by the New York Islanders of the NHL in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft (1st round, 17th overall). He turned pro in 1988 with the Islanders' American Hockey League affiliate Springfield Indians, and in 1990 was one of the key players who led Indians to the Calder Cup championship.\n\nHe played parts of five seasons for the Islanders and became the first player in NHL playoff history to score two shorthanded goals on the same minor penalty, against the Pittsburgh Penguins on May 2, 1993, which also equaled the NHL record for shorthanded goals by a player in one game. He was selected as one of the original Florida Panthers in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft. Although he has been cast as a defensive forward in the NHL, he had his best scoring years in Miami and was one of the leaders in Florida's 1996 Stanley Cup run. In those 1995–96 playoffs, Fitzgerald scored the decisive goal in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was a 58-foot slapshot that found its way past Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso.\n\nHe was briefly traded to the Colorado Avalanche in 1998 before being drafted in another expansion draft, this time by the Nashville Predators, who sought out his veteran leadership.

{"id": "1803473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803473", "title": "Morton Smith", "text": "Morton Smith\n\nMorton Smith (May 28, 1915 – July 11, 1991) was an American professor of ancient history at Columbia University. He is best known for his reported discovery of the Mar Saba letter, a letter attributed to Clement of Alexandria containing excerpts from a Secret Gospel of Mark, during a visit to the monastery at Mar Saba in 1958. This letter fragment has had many names, from \"The Secret Gospel\" through \"The Mar Saba Fragment\" and the \"Theodoros\".\n\nSmith was born in Philadelphia on May 28, 1915. He received his bachelor's degrees from Harvard College and the Harvard Divinity School, a Ph.D. from Hebrew University in Jerusalem and a Th.D. in theology from Harvard Divinity School. He taught at Brown University and Drew University and then he became a teacher at Columbia University in 1957. He became professor emeritus in 1985 and continued as a lecturer in religion until 1990. He died of heart failure on July 11, 1991 in New York City.\n\nSmith was well known for his sharp wit when it came to religious debates. He made regular scholarly contributions in many fields, including but not limited to Greek and Latin classics, New Testament, Patristics, second-temple Judaism and rabbinics. Despite the numerous accusations of forgery against Smith's finding, Smith was seen as a dedicated scholar when it came to research. He devoted fifteen years of his life to just studying his finding of the Secret Gospel.\n\nIn 1941, Smith, at age 26, was on a trip to the holy land with the Harvard Divinity School. Due to issues relating to the war, he was stuck in Jerusalem, where he made acquaintances with a leader of the Greek Orthodox Church, who gave him a tour of various places, one of which happened to be the Mar Saba monastery. While there, Smith was given access to the libraries of the monastery. Years later, in 1958, having landed a teaching career at Columbia, Smith was awarded a sabbatical. With his sabbatical, Smith decided to return to Mar Saba, having since become very interested in the Mar Saba library. He recalled that during his first visit, the library had been a terrible mess, and according to Smith no one had bothered to catalog it.\n\nSmith reported he found the manuscript in the Mar Saba monastery in 1958, photographed it carefully, and then left the book where he found it. He first publicized the discovery in 1960 but, due to various delays, his main publications on the subject did not come out until 1973.\n\nMar Saba is a Greek Orthodox monastery overlooking the Kidron Valley in the West Bank east of Bethlehem. In 1973 Smith published a book in which he wrote that he had discovered a previously unknown letter of Clement of Alexandria (c.150 - c. 215) while cataloging documents there in the summer of 1958.\n\nRight from the start, some scholars voiced the opinion that the letter is not authentic, and that it was either an ancient or medieval forgery. In 1975, Quentin Quesnell published a lengthy article in the \"Catholic Biblical Quarterly\", where he even suggested that Smith had forged the document himself, and then photographed his alleged forgery. An incensed Smith issued a furious rebuttal, whereupon Quesnell disclaimed any personal accusations against Smith.\n\nIn 1985 in his \"Strange Tales\" Per Beskow of Lund cast doubt on the Gospel. Smith responded by threatening to sue the publisher, Fortress Press of Philadelphia, \"for a million dollars\" and the publisher amended the offending paragraph.\n\nSmith is featured discussing the Mar Saba letter in the UK television documentary series, \"\" (1984: Channel 4).\n\nSmith's contribution to Old Testament studies was contained in his \"Palestinian Parties and Politics That Shaped the Old Testament\" (1971). Using form criticism to reconstruct the social background to the Old Testament, Smith advanced the proposal that two parties had vied for supremacy in ancient Israel, the first composed of those which worshipped many gods of which Yahweh was chief, while the other, the \"Yahweh-alone\" faction, was largely the party of the priests of Jerusalem, who wished to establish a monopoly for Yahweh. In monarchic Judah the Yahweh-alone party were a permanent minority; although sometimes able to win over a king like Josiah to their cause. Meanwhile, the population at large, including most of the kings, remained stubbornly polytheistic, worshipping the same gods as their neighbours in Moab, Ammon etc. In the post-Exilic period the idea of Yahweh as the only god of Israel finally triumphed, but a new division emerged, between the separatists, who wished the Jews to remain strictly apart from their neighbours, (this separation being defined in terms of purity), and the assimilationists who wished for normal relations with them. Ultimately, by the late Persian/early Hellenistic period, the purists won, the modern version of the Hebrew Bible was written, and a recognisably modern Judaism emerged.\n\nSmith was admired and feared for his extraordinary ability to look at familiar texts in unfamiliar ways, to re-open old questions, to pose new questions, and to demolish received truths. He practiced the \"hermeneutics of suspicion\" to devastating effect. His answers are not always convincing but his questions cannot be ignored.\n\nBooks:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Victoria, Australia. Before British colonisation, they lived as all people of the Kulin nation lived, sustainably on the land, for tens of thousands of years. They were called the Western Port or Port Philip tribe by the early settlers, and were in alliance with other tribes in the Kulin nation, having particularly strong ties to the Wurundjeri people.\n\nBoon wurrung was a dialect of Wuy-wurrung, a Kulin language of the Pama-Nyungan language family. The ethnonym occasionally used in early writings to refer to the Bunwurrung, namely \"Bunwurru\", is derived from the word \"bu:n\", meaning \"no\" and \"wur:u\", signifying either \"lip\" or \"speech\".\n\nThe Bunurong people are predominantly saltwater people whose lands, waters, and cosmos encompassed some of territory around Western Port Bay and the Mornington Peninsula. Its western boundary was set at Werribee. To the southeast, it extended from Mordialloc through to Anderson Inlet, as far as Wilson's Promontory. Inland its borders reached the Dandenong Ranges, and ran eastwards as far as the vicinity of Warragul.\n\nCommunities consisted of six or more (depending on the extent of the territory) land-owning groups called \"clans\" that spoke a related language and were connected through cultural and mutual interests, totems, trading initiatives, and marriage ties. Access by other clans to land and resources (such as the Birrarung, or Yarra River) was sometimes restricted depending on the state of the resource in question. For example; if a river or creek had been fished regularly throughout the fishing season and fish supplies were down, fishing was limited or stopped entirely by the clan who owned that resource until fish were given a chance to recover. During this time, other resources were utilized for food. This ensured the sustained use of the resources available to them. As with most other Kulin territories, penalties such as spearings were enforced upon trespassers. Today, traditional clan locations, language groups, and borders are no longer in use and descendants of Wurundjeri people live within modern-day society.\n\nIt is generally considered that before European settlement, six separate clans existed, each with an Arweet, or clan headman.\n\n\nThe Bunurong social divisions consisted of moieties, classifying people either as \"Bunjil\" the Eaglehawk or \"Waang\" the raven.\n\nThe Bunurong clans would have been aware of the Europeans, as people of the coast who watched the explorers ships sail past, then enter Port Phillip and Western Port. Initial contact was made in February 1801, when Lieutenant Murray and his crew from the \"Lady Nelson\" came ashore for fresh water near present-day Sorrento. A wary exchange of spears and stone axes for shirts, mirrors and a steel axe, ended when the British panicked, resulting in spears flying, musket shots and the use of the ship's cannon, wounding several fleeing Bunurong people.\n\nThe following month, Captain Milius from the French ship \"Naturaliste\", in the Baudin expedition, danced alone on a beach at Western Port for the natives, in a much more peaceful contact.\n\nJust before and overlapping the period of British exploration and settlement, the Bunurong were involved in a long-running dispute with the Gunai/Kurnai people from Gippsland. According to William Barak, the last traditional elder of the Wurundjeri people, the conflict was a dispute over resources, which resulted in heavy casualties being suffered by the Bunurong. Many Gunnai raids occurred to abduct Bunurong women. The Yowengerra had almost been completely annihilated by 1836, largely as a result of attacks from the Gunai. During 1833–1834 around 60–70 Bunurong people, if a report has been correctly interpreted, may have been killed in a raid by Gunai when they were camped to the north of Carrum Carrum Swamp.\n\nThe first British settlement occurred at Sullivan Bay in October 1803, near modern-day Sorrento, Victoria, under the command of Lieutenant David Collins. William Buckley, a convict, escaped from this abortive settlement and lived for more than 30 years with the Wathaurong people before approaching John Batman's party in 1835.\n\nThe Bunurong people, living primarily along the Port Phillip and Western Port coast, may have had their livelihoods affected by European seal hunters. The sealers' abduction of Bunurong women and taken to Bass Strait Islands and Tasmania may have caused inter-tribal conflicts, and by analogy, this may also apply to the Bunurong, whose coastlands were visited by sealers. A report by Jules Dumont d'Urville in 1830 attributed the absence of Bunurong on Phillip Island, which was a camp for sealers, as due to the latter's behavior. As late as 1833, nine Woiwurrung and Bunurong women, and a boy, Yonki Yonka, were kidnapped and ferried across to the sealers' Bass Strait island bases. Contact with sealers would have exposed the coastal tribes to European diseases, and this would have exercised a heavy impact on demographics, and the economic and social ties binding the Wurundjeri and Bunurong peoples, as would the possible effects of infectious diseases contracted from these sealers.\n\nJames Fleming, one of the party of surveyor Charles Grimes in HMS \"Cumberland\" who explored the Maribyrnong River and the Yarra River as far as Dights Falls in February 1803, reported smallpox scars on several aboriginal people he met, suggesting that a smallpox epidemic might have swept through the tribes around Port Philip before 1803, reducing the population. Broome puts forward that two epidemics of smallpox decimated the population of the Kulin tribes by perhaps killing half each time in the 1790s and again around 1830. This theory has been challenged, however, by modern historical diagnosticians, who argue that the observed symptoms in the early ethnographical literature are compatible with impetigo and ringworm.\n\nOne particularly notable person at the time of European settlement in Victoria was Derrimut, a Bunurong Elder, who informed early European settlers in October 1835 of an impending attack by clans from the Woiwurrung group. The colonists armed themselves, and the attack was averted. Benbow and Billibellary, from the Wurundjeri, also acted to protect the colonists as part of their duty of hospitality. Derrimut later became very disillusioned and died in the Benevolent Asylum at the age of about 54 years in 1864. A few colonists erected a tombstone to Derrimut in Melbourne General Cemetery in his honour.\n\nBy 1839, the Bunurong had been reduced to 80-90 people, with only 4 of 19 children under four years old, from a probable pre-contact population of greater than 500 people. By 1850 Protector William Thomas estimated just 28 Bunurong people living on Bunurong land.\n\nIn 1852, the Bunurong were allocated at Mordialloc Creek while the Woiworrung gained 782 hectares along the Yarra at Warrandyte. The Aboriginal reserves were never staffed by whites and were not permanent camps, but acted as distribution depots where rations and blankets were distributed, with the intention being to keep the tribes away from the growing settlement of Melbourne. The Aboriginal Protection Board revoked these two reserves in 1862–1863, considering them now too close to Melbourne.\n\nIn March 1863 after three years of upheaval, the surviving Kulin leaders, among them Simon Wonga and William Barak, led forty \"Wurundjeri\", \"Taungurong\" (Goulburn River) and \"Bunurong\" people over the Black Spur and squatted on a traditional camping site on Badger Creek near Healesville and requested ownership of the site. This became Coranderrk Station, named after the Woiwurrung word for the Victorian Christmas bush. Coranderrk was closed in 1924 and its occupants were moved to Lake Tyers in Gippsland.\n\nIn Bunurong belief, their territory was carved out by the creator \"Lohan\" as he moved from Yarra Flats down to his final resting place at \"Wa-mung\" and, as custodians of this \"marine-bek\" country, they required outsiders to observe certain ritual prohibitions and to learn their language if the newcomers were to enter their land without harm.\n\nGreat enmity existed in particular between the Bunurong and the eastern Gunai, who were later deemed responsible for playing a role in the drastic reduction of the tribe's population.\n\nInjury or death to a tribal member usually resulted in a conference to assess the facts, and, where thought unlawful, revenge was taken. In 1839, after one or two Bunurong/Woiwurrung were killed, a party of 15 men left for Geelong in order to retaliate against the malefactors, the Wathaurong.\nIn 1840, the Bunurong became convinced that a man from a tribe in Echuca had used sorcery to ordain the death of one of their warriors, whose name had been sung while a possum bone discarded after a Bunurong meal, and encased in a kangaroo's legbone, was roasted. Shortly afterwards the named Bunurong man died, and the tribe revenged itself on the first Echuca tribesman who then came to visit their territory. It was arranged by word of mouth, passing from Echuca through the Nirababaluk and Wurundjeri, for a meeting to have justice done at Merri Creek. 9 or 10 of the killed Echuca tribesman's kinsmen threw spears and boomerangs at the Bunurong warrior, armed with a shield, until he was wounded in the flank by a reed-spear. An elder of another, observing tribe, the Barapa Barapa, called it a day, the ordeal ended, and all celebrated a grand corroboree.\n\nBunurong Creation Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most mountain bikes once used ISO 559 mm wheels, commonly called 26\" wheels. The ISO 622 mm wheel is typically also used for road-racing, trekking, cyclo-cross, touring and hybrid bicycles.\nIn some countries, mainly in Continental Europe, ISO 622 mm wheels are commonly called 28\" wheels or \"28 Incher\".\n\n29er rims have a diameter of and the average 29\" mountain bike tire is (in ISO notation) 59-622 – corresponding to an outside diameter of about . The typical 26\" MTB tire has a rim diameter of and an outside tire diameter of about .\n\nIn the early 1980s, the size of the wheels for the emerging mountain bikes was undecided. So when English off-road cycling pioneer Geoff Apps contacted Gary Fisher and Charlie Kelly with news that he had built a prototype off-road bicycle that used large-diameter 28 x 1¾ (ISO 47-622), 47mm wide Nokian Hakkapeliitta snow tires from Finland, they were intrigued. In a letter to the December 2006 issue of Bike Biz magazine, Gary Fisher, speaking about the growing popularity of 29ers, gives his perspective: \"We got some tires from Geoff Apps really early on and we [Fisher and Kelly] said ‘Holy Toledo!'\" But the poor supply situation of the larger diameter tires meant the fledgling MTB industry stuck with the smaller wheel size.\" The first Geoff Apps-designed 700C wheeled off-road bicycle was made in 1981.\n\nHowever the bicycle marketed as the Aventura by Apps' own company, Cleland Cycles Ltd, between 1982 and 1984 used the more readily available Nokian Hakkapeliitta 26 × 2 (ISO 54-584). The 650B size, also known as 27.5\", reappeared in 2007 as a compromise between the 26 inch and 29 inch sizes.\nThe 650B size is called 27.5\".\n\nThe name \"29er\" comes from a bicycle called the Two Niner, which was offered by the Fisher bike company in 2001, according to 1998 Mountain Bike Hall of Fame inductee Don Cook.\n\nThe US division of Bianchi Bicycles offered a line of 29\" wheeled off-road bikes beginning in 1991 called the Project bikes. Their 1992 product catalog raved about the advantages of the larger wheels and showed three different bikes, the Project 3, 5 and 7. Likewise, in 1991 Panaracer developed a 700c version of the Smoke Tire for OEM use on the Diamondback Overdrive and Overdrive Comp mountain bikes. The original company Klein produced a small quantity of a 29\" wheeled version of their successful \"Attitude\" MTB racer, and named it the Adept. It failed to find a market and was discontinued.\n\nA key product release, the first true 29\" tire, was produced by an early supporter of the 29\" movement Wilderness Trail Bikes. The company introduced the first true 29\" tire, the Nanoraptor, in 1999. At about the same time, White Brothers produced the first commercially available 29\" suspension forks. Before then suspension forks used were forks designed for trekking bikes or hybrids. For many years, 29\" frames and bikes were usually only available from small little-known manufactures like Niner Bikes. Surly Bikes introduced their 29\" frameset, the Karate Monkey, in 2002. Gary Fisher Bicycles, a division of Trek Bicycles, became the first of the major manufactures to offer a line of 29\" bikes. Their lines never sold well until the introduction of single-speed 29\" bike the Rig, in 2004. Today, most bicycle manufacturers in the US market offer at least one 29\" bicycle or frame.\n\nA tire with a tread width of less than in width is sometimes considered a cyclocross tire by 29\" enthusiasts, even though in cyclocross any tire wider than is not a cyclocross tire. Although they are both intended for off road use, and typically use a 622 mm rim, cyclocross bikes and 29\" wheeled MTBs differ in their basic handling and geometry, construction methods, durability, and intended lifespan. Bikes exist that blur the distinction by combining attributes of both, however. One example of this is a Monstercross bike, often using a standard mountain bike frame intended for use with 26\" wheels with 700c wheels and 700 x 38c-45c tires, disc or cantilever brakes, MTB or cross gearing, and the drop bars of a cyclocross bike.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of 29ers are often debated in the mountain bike community. Disadvantages of the 29\" wheel include added weight, perceived sluggishness in handling, and problems with fit (specifically, front wheel/toe overlap and high standover height). Advantages include reduced rolling resistance, perceived increased stability while retaining quick handling, and an enhanced ability to roll over obstacles.\n\nOne item that is often raised is tire contact patch size and shape. All else being equal, such as tire width, rim width, inflation pressure and rider weight, the contact patch of a 29\" wheel has the same area and is slightly longer (~5%) than that of a 26\" wheel.\n\n\nMost of these claims have yet to be objectively investigated. Small scale, unpublished studies (including one done by Pepperdine University, reportedly at the request of Gary Fisher) exist but both proponents and detractors of 29\" wheels are generally unimpressed with their scientific rigor. Long debates over how to conduct a \"fair\" test of the efficiency of 29\" vs 26\" mountain bikes have raged online, but no serious efforts have been made to conduct a large-scale, scientific study.\n\n\nOne variation is to have a 29\" front wheel and a 26\" rear wheel (commonly called a \"96er\"). Using the smaller rear wheel allows shorter and quicker handling frames, more options for rear suspension designs and lighter bicycle weight. Another variation is to have a 26\" front wheel with a 29\" rear wheel (commonly called a \"69er\" though Trek introduced a \"69er\" in 2007 with a 29\" front wheel and a 26\" rear wheel).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1803482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803482", "title": "Aldene Connection", "text": "Aldene Connection\n\nThe Aldene Connection is a connection between two railroad lines in Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States, one formerly belonging to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), the other formerly of the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The connections allow trains on the New Jersey Transit Raritan Valley Line to travel from Cranford through stations in Roselle Park and Union to the Hunter Connection in Newark, which in turn allows access to the Northeast Corridor and Newark Penn Station.\n\nThe CNJ in the mid-1960s was losing money, in a permanent downward spiral that would lead to the railroad's filing for bankruptcy early in 1967. Desperate to cut costs, the CNJ turned to the state who created a \"railroad transportation division\" within the highway commission headed up by Dwight R. G. Palmer, who was placed in charge of preserving rail commuter services as a cheaper alternative to a new highway building program. Palmer's office produced a report called \"The Rail Transportation Problem\" stating that the state should partiality subsidize service until more fundamental changes could be made. One of these \"fundamental changes\" became known as the \"Aldene Plan\". It would involve the building of a ramp to connect the CNJ and the Lehigh Valley Railroad at the site of the recently abandoned Aldene Station to reroute trains bound for Jersey City to follow the LV to the Pennsylvania Railroad mainline (now the Northeast Corridor) and on to Newark Penn Station where passengers could transfer to PRR trains into New York Penn Station. This would allow the CNJ to abandon its labor-intensive ferry service and much of its Communipaw Terminal in Jersey City, and all local trains operating east of Cranford, all totaling up to about $1.5 million in annual savings. As a concession to a few hundred factory workers that worked along the CNJ east of Aldene, Budd Rail Diesel Cars continued to run between Cranford and Bayonne (over the CRRNJ Newark Bay Bridge) until August 6, 1978.\n\nOpening day for the Aldene Plan was announced for Monday, May 1, 1967, but a full-service rehearsal occurred the day prior (a Sunday to avoid the commuter rush). The CNJ operated push-pull consists of a cab car leading eastbound. Until 2014, operations remained the same: passengers for New York would disembark at Newark and change to a Northeast Corridor or North Jersey Coast Line train operated by New Jersey Transit to New York Penn Station or PATH trains to the World Trade Center. However, in 2014 NJ Transit began offering a one-seat ride to New York making use of their recently purchased dual mode locomotives, which can change between diesel power and electric power. The trains operate under diesel power on the Raritan Valley Line which has never been electrified. At Newark, the diesel motors are shut down and a pantograph is raised, since only electric trains can operate into New York Penn Station. Currently the dual-mode service is only run during off-peak hours as Penn Station cannot accommodate any more trains during rush hours.\n\nAlso affected by the change was the Reading Company's \"Crusader\" service from Philadelphia, which operated over the CNJ via trackage rights. After the Aldene Plan went into effect, it began to operate into Newark Penn Station, continuing until 1981 as a through service, and then as a connecting train from West Trenton through 1982. New Jersey Transit has explored reactivating this service as the West Trenton Line.\n\nThe Aldene Connection is single track, although it is graded to allow a second track to be added.\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Progressive Conservative from 1971 to 1990, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Bill Davis.\n\nWiseman was educated at Smiths Falls College, and worked as a farmer and small businessman. He developed a prominent cow-calf business in the region, and later opened a chain of discount shoe stores. Wiseman was also a public school board chair, and a trustee of St. Paul's United Church in Perth, Ontario.\n\nHe was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1971 provincial election, gaining an easy victory in the eastern Ontario constituency of Lanark. He was returned in the 1975 election, and was named parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health on November 19, 1975.\n\nWiseman was appointed as a minister without portfolio in Davis's government on January 21, 1978. On August 30, 1979, he was promoted to Minister of Government Services. On July 6, 1983 Wiseman was dropped from cabinet. Davis gave no particular reason for dropping Wiseman other than to say he needed to make space for \"new blood\". There was some speculation that Wiseman's removal was a result of a dispute with one of Davis's favourite deputy ministers, Alan Gordon. Wiseman alleged that Gordon had awarded six figure government contracts without tender or permission.\n\nWiseman who was upset at the demotion, went so far as to criticize his own party in the house. On May 1, 1984, he accused Solicitor-General George Taylor of forcing the OPP to purchase a pair of new boats from a supplier in Penetanguishene, Ontario which was in Taylor's own riding. The lowest bidder was a company based in Wiseman's riding. Wiseman was accused of retaliation for his removal from cabinet. Wiseman denied this, saying he was only looking out for his constituents. He said, \"You have to do what you think is right for your constituents... From time to time you have to take a stand for your people... If you're going to be a jelly fish and hide behind a chair, you shouldn't be in politics.\" In the fall of 1984, Davis, partly to ameliorate the situation, appointed Wiseman to a government commission promoting the sale of agricultural products to the Americans.\n\nThe Progressive Conservatives, who had governed the province continually since 1943, lost power following the 1985 election but Wiseman was re-elected without difficulty. He faced a close challenge from Liberal Bob Pugh in the 1987 campaign in the newly reconfigured riding of Lanark—Renfrew. Wiseman won by 761 votes. He held no Critic portfolios in the legislature, and did not seek re-election in 1990.\n"}

He was drafted by the Tennessee Titans sixth overall in the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at West Virginia.\n\nJones has also played for the Dallas Cowboys, Cincinnati Bengals, and Denver Broncos, spending most of his career in Cincinnati. He was suspended from the NFL for the entire 2007 season and for part of the 2008 season due to off-the-field conduct.\n\nJones was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised by his mother, Deborah Jones, and his grandmother, Christine Jones. His father was killed in a robbery in 1991 at the age of 26. As a child growing up in the Sandtown neighborhood of Atlanta, he was coached by longtime Sandtown coach Gary Jones. When Jones was a freshman at West Virginia University, his grandmother died of cancer. Jones only missed one game of his three-year college career, which was to attend her funeral. On the day of the NFL Draft, Jones wore a T-shirt that featured his grandmother's picture.\n\nJones attended Westlake High School, in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2005, Westlake had the most alumni in the NFL with six players. Jones played in the Georgia-Florida all-star game, and was selected as the conference \"Player of the Year\" following his senior year after totaling 120 tackles, six interceptions and 1,850 rushing yards.\n\nIn addition to his accomplishments in football, Jones also earned All-American honors in basketball and track. His basketball team won two state championships.\n\nJones was an Athletic Coaching Education major and a member of the Athletic Director's Academic Honor Roll. As a freshman in 2002, Jones appeared in 11 games for West Virginia as a reserve cornerback and safety. He totaled one interception and one forced fumble with 36 tackles. During 2003, he appeared in all 13 games, starting nine at cornerback, and taking over full-time kick return and punt return duties. Jones' second season resulted in a second team All-Big East Conference selection with his career-high 89 tackles and four interceptions, one being for a touchdown. He also had six tackles for losses, one forced fumble and two fumble recoveries. He also had a career-high 12 passes defended that season. In a game against Boston College, Jones scored two touchdowns in a 35–28 win over the Eagles, one an 87-yard kick return and the other, a 47-yard interception return. Jones also had a career-high 12 tackles against Miami. Jones totaled 98 punt return yards on 16 punt returns and 867 kick return yards, including an 87-yard touchdown return.\n\nAs a junior in 2004, he was the secondary captain and led the team in tackles and interceptions. Jones also played briefly on offense, as well as returning punts and kick-offs for the second season. He was named first-team all-Big East as a defensive back and honorable mention All-American by several sources. He led the team with 76 tackles, adding two sacks, three interceptions, and seven passes defended. Jones was named to collegefootballnews.com's All-American first-team and was named honorable mention All-American at kick returner. Jones was also named Big East Special Teams Player of the Year. His 76-yard punt return against East Carolina was his season-long return and only punt return for a touchdown in Jones' career. Jones ended his college career in the 2005 Gator Bowl, when he fumbled a kick return early in the game; the Mountaineers lost to Florida State.\n\nJones is ranked second on West Virginia's career kickoff return yardage list with 1,475 yards. He is ranked 11th on the school's career punt return yardage list with 404 yards, while his 10.92 yards per punt return is the sixth most in school history. Jones is one of the highest West Virginia players drafted. Jones and fellow-Mountaineer great Major Harris both wore the #9 while playing in college.\n\nAfter his junior year, Jones opted to forgo his senior year and declare himself eligible for the NFL Draft. He was the first defensive player drafted, taken sixth overall by the Tennessee Titans in the 2005 NFL Draft. He missed most of training camp, holding out in a contract dispute. According to Titans then-general manager Floyd Reese, the Titans were concerned over several off-the-field incidents. Reese said that contract talks broke down when Jones balked at the Titans' proposed safeguards, but agreed that he would not be paid any guaranteed or bonus money if he were convicted of a crime.\n\nDuring his rookie season, he had 44 tackles and 10 pass deflections. On special teams, Jones totaled 1,399 return yards and one touchdown. Jones and Reynaldo Hill were the only rookie duo to start at least 10 games each at cornerback in the NFL.\n\nIn Jones's sophomore season, he totaled career-high 62 tackles, one sack, one forced fumble, 12 deflected passes, four interceptions, 130 return yards, one interception touchdown, 14 passes defended (second-team), 440 punt return yards and tied for NFL-high with three punt return touchdowns. The three punt returns also tied the franchise record with Billy \"White Shoes\" Johnson, which was set in 1975. His 12.9 yards per punt return average led the NFL, edging out Chicago's Devin Hester by 1/10 of a yard, while his 26.1 yards per kick return average ranked seventh in the league and sixth in the AFC. Jones also caught two passes on offense for 31 yards (one for 17 yards) and rushed twice for eight yards. His best performance came against the Jacksonville Jaguars in week 15, when Jones had an 83-yard interception return for a score, a 70-yard kick return, and broke up a touchdown pass to Matt Jones to save the game. Jones broke out in his fifth game of the season against the Indianapolis Colts, when he recorded a season-high five tackles and defended a pass in the 14–13 loss. The next week against the Washington Redskins, Jones recorded four tackles and stripped the ball from Antwaan Randle El for the first forced fumble of his career. The next week against Houston, Jones tied a career-high tackle total with eight, and picked off a Sage Rosenfels pass for his first career interception, and also posted his second touchdown on a punt return in his career in the fourth quarter with a 53-yard return. Two weeks later, against the Eagles, Jones recorded his second punt return for a score of the season, a 90-yard run, breaking Billy Johnson's 87-yard franchise record. The next week against the New York Giants, Jones picked off an Eli Manning pass in the fourth quarter that sparked the Titans' 21-point comeback. Against the New England Patriots in the last game of the season, Jones totaled 259 return yards (the NFL's highest total since 2006) along with a punt return score.\n\nDespite Jones' breakout second year, speculation was rife during the 2007 NFL Draft that the Titans were seriously considering releasing or trading him due to his numerous off-the-field problems. \"The league and the Titans, including coaches and individuals in the Tennessee locker room, have spent countless hours trying to direct and counsel Jones,\" said Reese. He also said that while Jones had been everything the Titans hoped for on the field, he'd been \"nothing but a disaster off the field\" during his two years in Nashville, and felt that he was on \"a downward spiral.\"\n\nOn April 10, 2007, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced a one-year suspension for Jones for violation of the NFL player conduct policy, to be re-evaluated after the 10th regular-season game, pending disposition of current cases, which Jones appealed. This was the first time in 44 years that a player was suspended for an offense other than substance abuse. Jones took out a full page ad in \"The Tennessean\", promising he would \"win back trust\" of his teammates and fans. \"To my family, teammates, coaches and fans, I recognize that I have lost the right to ask for your patience and understanding,\" wrote Jones. \"However, I will do everything in my power to regain your trust and respect.\" Jones also wrote in the letter that he planned to finish his degree at West Virginia University. \"The basis of the appeal ... will be to clarify some of the facts and address the unprecedented punishment that was imposed,\" Jones wrote in the letter. However, on June 12, Jones withdrew his appeal.\n\nDuring his suspension Jones signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, despite an agreement between TNA and the Titans organization that he would only have a \"non-physical\" role in the company, and went on to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship with Ron Killings. He also established a record label, \"National Street League Records\", and performed as one half of the rap duo Posterboyz.\n\nTen weeks into the 2007 season, Roger Goodell reviewed his decision, but ultimately declined to reduce it. Following this announcement, the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) said that it would appeal Jones' suspension. Tennessee running back LenDale White told \"The Tennessean\" that he thought all Titans players wanted Jones to return to the team. Quarterback Vince Young said, \"We are going to do well without him, we can do well with him...\". On December 13, 2007, the NFL agreed to hear the players union's appeal on Jones' behalf. The players union appealed Roger Goodell's decision to not allow Jones to be reinstated during the 2007 season.\n\nOn February 1, 2008, ESPN reported that Goodell remained disappointed in Jones and that he would most likely not be reinstated after the Super Bowl. The NFL was to review Jones after the 2008 Pro Bowl. It was also reported that the Titans would try to trade Jones, if reinstated.\n\nOn March 8, 2008, Jones announced on a Tennessee radio station that he was in \"tip-top shape\" and was ready to be reinstated. His agent also announced that they would consider applying for reinstatement before the 2008 NFL Draft. Jones also said on the radio show that he would like to play for the Dallas Cowboys if the Titans desired to trade him. The Detroit Lions, Oakland Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Texans and New Orleans Saints also expressed interest in Jones. On March 30, Jones participated at a charity basketball event, where he then signed a football for a fan with the #21, saying that he believed he would wear the number if he ended up in Dallas with the Cowboys. NFL Network correspondent Adam Schefter had also described the Tennessee–Dallas trade for Jones as being \"imminent\". On April 1, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said he would have a decision on reinstating Jones prior to training camp. However, the next day, reports said the trade was being delayed due to the Cowboys denying the request to provide a fourth-round pick and a pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. Also, the two teams disagreed over whether the Cowboys would reimburse the Titans for a bonus owed to Jones. On April 14, Schefter reported that trade talks had restarted, with the Cowboys offering a sixth-round pick and the Titans requesting a fourth-round pick in the 2008 draft.\n\nOn April 23, 2008, Jones was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. As Jones was reinstated for the 2008–2009 season, the Cowboys would also give their sixth-round pick to Tennessee in 2009.\n\nJones also reached a financial settlement with the Titans regarding his contract situation: he agreed to pay $500,000 to a charity chosen by the Titans in the next two years. Jones signed a four-year contract that included annual roster bonuses and was structured to protect Dallas if Jones made more off-field mistakes.\n\nOn April 24, Hall of Famer Jim Brown announced that he had offered his support and help to Jones while in Dallas. Former Cowboys teammates and NFL standouts Michael Irvin and Deion Sanders also both expressed a willingness to help the troubled cornerback.\n\nBeginning in June, Jones was cleared to participate in organized team activities with the Cowboys, including training camp and preseason games. On August 26, Jones was fully reinstated for the 2008 NFL season.\n\nIn the season opener for the Cowboys, a 28–10 victory against the Cleveland Browns, Jones recorded a tackle and a pass deflection. In the following 41–37 victory against the Philadelphia Eagles, Jones recorded four tackles and a pass deflection. In a 27–16 victory over the Green Bay Packers, Jones led the Cowboys with eight tackles and a fumble recovery.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 19, 2008, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the suspended cornerback would be reinstated by commissioner Roger Goodell, but he would miss two more games, November 23 and 27, and would return to play December 7 at Pittsburgh. By the time of his return, Jones would be suspended from 22 of a possible 28 games.\n\nDue to the suspension, the Titans gave their fifth-round pick to the Cowboys in 2009 and returned the sixth-round pick to Dallas, as stipulated in terms of the trade.\n\nIn the December 7 Pittsburgh Steelers game, Jones suffered a neck injury, but continued to play. Later that week news reports indicated that the injury was more severe than first believed, and could be a season-ending or career-ending injury for Jones. On December 10, 2008, the Cowboys announced that Jones would probably be out for the rest of the season. However, he returned to play in the Cowboys' final game of the season, a 44–6 loss against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nOn January 7, 2009, the Cowboys announced they would release Jones. According to ESPN's Ed Werder, the move came after Cowboys officials learned that Jones was a suspect in a June 2007 shooting outside a strip club in Atlanta. Jones was alleged to have ordered the shooting after a dispute with one of the men. Due to NFL rules which bar major player transactions until after the Super Bowl, the Cowboys did not officially cut ties with Jones until February 9, 2009.\n\nIn August 2009, Jones agreed in principle to a one-year deal to play with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. The CFL season, which runs from July through November, was half over at the time.\n\nHowever, on September 2 the Blue Bombers announced they were no longer interested in Jones after he made some remarks in an internet video including calling the league the United Football League instead of the Canadian Football League. The startup UFL reportedly offered Jones a contract which he turned down.\n\nJones worked out with the Cincinnati Bengals on February 12, 2010, but the Bengals did not offer him a contract. Jones worked out for NFL scouts on March 19 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Six NFL teams were in attendance. At his workout, his 40-yard dash time was 4.42 seconds.\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Jones signed a two-year deal with the Bengals. He went through the off-season and pre-season without incident and made the regular-season roster. He made his Bengals debut on September 12, 2010 as a kick returner and a backup cornerback. He returned two kickoffs for 37 yards and made two tackles and an assist on defense during the Bengals' 38–24 loss to the New England Patriots. On October 26, Jones sustained a serious neck injury and missed the remainder of the 2010 season.\n\nJones returned to action with the Bengals on October 30, 2011, returning one punt for 63 yards. He suffered a hamstring injury and did not play for the rest of the game.\n\nOn March 21, 2013, Jones signed a three-year deal to remain with the Bengals.\n\nIn the 2015 Wild Card Round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Jones became involved in an altercation with Steelers assistant coach Joey Porter late in the fourth quarter and was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. The Bengals were leading 16-15, but the back-to-back penalties drawn by Jones and Vontaze Burfict moved the Steelers into field goal range and allowed them to win the game 18-16. Jones was subsequently fined $28,940 for the altercation, which was reduced to $12,500 by the NFL after appeal. Porter would be fined $10,000 for his actions. The incident led to the creation of the \"Joey Porter Rule\", which prohibits assistant coaches from entering the field of play.\n\nOn March 9, 2016, Jones signed a three-year deal to remain with the Bengals.\n\nJones was suspended the first game of the 2017 season for violating the league's personal conduct policy. In Week 13, Jones suffered a groin injury while intercepting a pass by Ben Roethlisberger. He was placed on injured reserve on December 9, 2017.\n\nOn March 9, 2018, the Bengals announced they had declined the option in his contract for the 2018 season, making Jones a free agent.\n\nOn August 26, 2018, Jones signed with the Denver Broncos. He played in seven games before being released on November 20, 2018.\n\nOn May 24, 2019, Jones announced his retirement.\n\n\nWhen drafted, Jones was on probation for a fight in West Virginia. He encountered more legal trouble before playing a down for the Titans. On July 14, 2005, Jones was arrested on charges of assault and felony vandalism stemming from a nightclub altercation in Nashville. On September 5, 2005, police had to become involved when Jones engaged in a loud verbal tantrum after being told to wait in line for his vehicle at the annual Nashville Sports Council Kickoff luncheon where he was a guest. He refused to pay for valet services used that evening, claiming he had no money.\n\nThe state of West Virginia filed a petition alleging Jones had not made regular and sufficient contact with his probation officer or reported his July arrest in a timely fashion. The court ordered Jones’ probation extended for 90 days.\n\nIn February 2006, Jones was arrested in Fayetteville, Georgia after an incident outside a home. Charges of marijuana possession were quickly dismissed, but the state pressed charges for felony and misdemeanor counts of obstruction of justice.\n\nA Cadillac with Jones' nickname \"Pacman\" stitched in the headrests was seized during an April 2006 cocaine bust. The car was not registered to Jones at that time, but Jones told a local TV reporter it was his car and that he had loaned it to Darryl Jerome Moore for a music video. Police sources confirmed that Moore was the main target of their investigation. Jones later bought the car at a police auction.\n\nOn August 25, 2006, during training camp, Jones was arrested in Murfreesboro, Tennessee for disorderly conduct and public intoxication at a nightclub after he spat on a woman he accused of stealing his wallet. Police said they ordered Jones to leave several times, but he refused, continuing to shout profanities at the woman. A judge gave Jones six months probation on the condition he stay out of trouble and away from the nightclub. On October 26, 2006, Jones was cited for misdemeanor assault for allegedly spitting in the face of a female Tennessee State University student during a private party at Club Mystic, a Nashville nightclub. He was suspended by the Titans for one game.\n\nOn the morning of February 19, 2007, during the 2007 NBA All-Star Game weekend in Las Vegas, Jones was allegedly involved in an altercation with an exotic dancer at Minxx, a local strip club. Jones and American rap artist Nelly, along with someone known as Richard Rich, showered the stage with hundreds of $1 bills, an act known as \"making it rain.\" Club promoter Chris Mitchell then directed his dancers to collect the money. According to the club's co-owner, Jones became enraged when a dancer began taking the money without his permission. He allegedly grabbed her by her hair and slammed her head on the stage. A security guard intervened and scuffled with members of Jones' entourage of half a dozen people. Jones then allegedly threatened the guard's life. During this time, Mitchell and a male associate left the club with a garbage bag filled with $81,020 and two Breitling watches, which police later recovered. After club patrons left following the original confrontation, the club owner claimed a person in Jones' entourage returned with a gun and fired into a crowd, damaging equipment and hitting three people, including a security guard. The guard was shot twice, and one of the people hit—former professional wrestler Tommy Urbanski—was paralyzed from the waist down. Jones maintains that he did not know the shooter, although the club's owner insisted Jones did. On March 26, 2007, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department recommended to the city's district attorney that Jones be charged with one count of felony coercion, one misdemeanor count of battery and one misdemeanor count of threat to life.\n\nMore trouble followed Jones after the altercation, when drug dealer Darryl Jerome Moore was arrested. Wiretapped phone conversations between Moore and his friends revealed Moore talking about how Jones bet on college games to earn quick money. \"You know, I was talking to him the other day about smoking, and he was like 'man, if I didn't smoke I couldn't take all the stress that I'm dealing with right now,'\" Moore said.\n\nOn June 20, 2007, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Clark County District Attorney's office announced that Jones would face two felony charges stemming from the February strip club melee. On November 13, 2007, Jones accepted a plea deal, and on December 6 Jones pleaded no contest to one charge of conspiracy to commit disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor. He was given a suspended prison sentence of one year, probation, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.\n\nOn June 25, 2007, Tommy Urbanski and his wife, Kathy, sued Jones in civil court, claiming that Jones had bitten his left ankle and was responsible for the shooting. The lawsuit also named the Tennessee Titans and the NFL as defendants, on the grounds that Jones' employers knew of his erratic behavior prior to the Minxx incident, but did not suspend him until afterwards. Had the Titans suspended Jones prior to the NBA All-Star game, the suit argues, he would not have been invited to the Las Vegas events, and the incident would not have taken place.\n\nOn April 21, 2008, a document revealed that Jones, through intermediaries, paid $15,000 extortion money in two installments to one Arvin Kenti Edwards, the alleged Minxx club shooter.\n\nOn January 15, 2012, a jury ordered Jones to pay $11.6 million to Urbanski and Aaron Cudworth, a bouncer who was wounded, for Jones' role in the 2007 Las Vegas shooting. Jones' attorney said he planned to appeal the verdict.\n\nOn January 9, 2015, the Nevada Supreme Court upheld the order for Jones to pay $11 million to Urbanski and $1.3 million to Aaron Cudworth, who was also shot working with Urbanski in Las Vegas on the day of the shooting.\n\nOn May 7, 2007, Jones was stopped at 12:45 a.m. on Interstate 65 heading into downtown Nashville after an officer clocked him on radar at 79 miles per hour in a 55 miles per hour zone. Jones was driving the red 2004 Cadillac XLR Roadster which had been seized in the April 2006 cocaine bust, and which he had bought back from the police at auction.\n\nOn June 18, 2007, Jones was sought by police for questioning after a shooting at an Atlanta strip club allegedly involving members of his entourage. According to police at the scene, Jones was not present during the shooting, and was not being charged.\n\nOn August 13, 2007, regarding the February Las Vegas strip club incident, Jones told Bryant Gumbel of HBO Sports' \"Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel\" he was innocent and had never hit the stripper or told anyone he was going to kill them. When asked about friend and convicted drug dealer Darryl Moore, Jones said that he did not know Moore was a drug dealer and felt surprised and betrayed. Jones also said he did not think he got a fair say in his April meeting with NFL commissioner Goodell.\n\nOn January 15, 2008, Jones was accused of hitting a woman in a strip club in Atlanta, Georgia on the morning of January 3. The woman, Wanda S. Jackson, was seeking an arrest warrant.\n\nOn June 21, 2008, the Associated Press reported Jones' $1.5 million home was in foreclosure. The home and , located in a Nashville suburb, was sold June 27 on the steps of the Williamson County Courthouse.\n\nOn October 8, 2008, Jones was involved in an altercation with his bodyguard in a Dallas hotel. Although there was no police report, nor was anyone arrested or charged,\nJones was suspended for a minimum of four games by the NFL for violating the league's personal conduct policy. On October 16, Jones entered an alcohol rehabilitation center.\n\nIn a letter to Jones, Goodell called the Dallas incident the continuation of \"a disturbing pattern of behavior and clearly inconsistent with the conditions I set for your continued participation in the NFL.\"\n\nOn January 3, 2017, Jones was arrested in Cincinnati's central district for obstructing official business, disorderly conduct, assault, and a felony charge of harassment with a bodily substance. On May 15, 2017 Jones accepted a plea agreement, pleading guilty to one count of obstructing a police officer. He received credit for time served (two days). Jones received a one-game suspension from the NFL on July 21, 2017, regarding the incident.\n\nOn July 10, 2018, Jones was attacked by an Atlanta airport employee, who was arrested for assault.\n\nOn July 30, 2007, the media reported Jones was working on a deal with the professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). As the news circulated, Titans coach Jeff Fisher said Jones’ football contract precluded him from wrestling, but negotiations continued for a non-wrestling role. On August 6, TNA confirmed a deal had been signed. In interviews with Jones and Jeff Jarrett, one of TNA's vice presidents, the two indicated Jones did intend to wrestle, primarily as part of a tag team.\n\nAfter some legal involvement, Jones agreed to appear in a non-physical role only. On August 12, 2007, Pacman Jones made his TNA debut at Hard Justice. During his time in TNA, Jones was placed into a tag team known as Team Pacman with Ron \"The Truth\" Killings. On September 9, 2007, at No Surrender, Team PacMan defeated Sting and Kurt Angle to become the new TNA World Tag Team Champions.\n\nOn the October 4, episode of \"TNA iMPACT!\", Team Pacman successfully defended the TNA World Tag Team Championships against Team 3D winning the match via Disqualification after an interference from the Voodoo Kin Mafia. The following week on the October 11, episode of \"TNA iMPACT!\", Team Pacman once again successfully defended the TNA World Tag Team Championships against Triple X members Elix Skipper and Senshi.\n\nOn October 14, 2007, at Bound for Glory, Jones was replaced by Rasheed Lucius \"Consequences\" Creed to wrestle in Jones' place, Since Jones was not allowed to appear in the ring. Creed and Killings went on to lose the TNA World Tag Team Championships to Christian's Coalition (A.J. Styles and Tomko). Following Bound for Glory it was revealed that Jones' contract would not be extended thus ending his run in TNA.\n\nOn the November 7 episode of \"Impact\", Jones and Bengals practice squad member, defensive end DeQuin Evans, were sitting in the front row and got into an altercation with Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian), who pushed both players, leading them to jump the guardrail and bodyslam both wrestlers in the ring.\n\n\nAlso during his 2007 NFL exile, Jones announced that he would be collaborating on a hip hop album with his group, Posterboyz, which released the single \"Let it Shine\" through a MySpace page.\n\nJones’ mother gave him the nickname \"Pacman\" when he was a child, saying that he would change direction as fast as the video game character Pac-Man.\n\nHis nickname was often used more than his name, Adam. It was represented by a \"P\" on the back of his Titans jersey. In the game \"\", a player named Packrat James is a direct reference to Jones' nickname.\n\nIn June 2008, Jones decided he only wanted to be known as \"Adam Jones\" or \"Mr. Jones,\" in an attempt to separate himself from his troubled past.\n\nOn July 5, 2014 Adam Jones married Tishana Holmes. The couple have three children together.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1803492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803492", "title": "Trillium Line", "text": "Trillium Line\n\nThe Trillium Line (), marketed as Line 2 (), is a diesel light rail transit (DLRT) service in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, operated by OC Transpo. The line is part of the O-Train light rail system. On May 3, 2020, the Trillium Line was shut down for two years to accommodate the extension and upgrading of the line. Replacement buses will serve each station during the construction period.\n\nFrom 2001 until 2020, the line ran north–south on a railway line, from Bayview to Greenboro, a distance of approximately . It is isolated from road traffic, but shares tracks with other trains; after operating hours, the section of track south of Walkley Yard has been infrequently used by Ottawa Central for freight service to the National Research Council.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015, there was an upgrade of the line, including the complete replacement of the train fleet, in order to cut wait times during peak periods from 15 minutes to 12 minutes and eventually to 8–10 minutes. The upgrade was a precursor to extending the line southwards by four stations.\n\nIn 2022, a extension and upgrade to the existing line is expected to be completed, adding eight new stations and a connection to the Macdonald–Cartier International Airport.\n\nUntil 2020, the Trillium Line operated on a single-track rail line with five stations and three passing loops. With the exception of , all stations have only a single platform.\n\nIt is legally considered a federally-regulated mainline railway despite being used for local public transport purposes, and the service it provides is, in terms of its route and service frequency, more like that of an urban railway than a metro or tramway. The line is operated by the City of Ottawa under the official name \"Capital Railway\", which appears on the trains along with their regular logo.\n\nThe Trillium Line was introduced on October 15, 2001, as a pilot project to provide an alternative to the Transitway bus rapid transit on which Ottawa had long depended exclusively for its high-grade transit service. The single-track line operated with five stations and a single passing loop at Carleton station.\n\nAs a pilot project, the Trillium Line system was built at the cost of , relatively little compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing Canadian Pacific Railway track (Ellwood and Prescott subdivisions), so the only construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions.\n\nFrom 2001 until 2015, the system used three diesel-powered Bombardier Talent BR643 low-floor diesel multiple unit trains. It was, however, described as \"light rail\", partly because plans called for it to be extended into Ottawa’s downtown as a tramway-like service, and partly because the Talent vehicles, though designed for mainline railways in Europe, are much smaller and lighter than most mainline trains in North America, and do not meet the Association of American Railroads' standards for crash strength. Ottawa is also authorized to run trains with only a single operator and no other crew, something rare on mainline railways in North America.\n\nUntil late 2014, the official name of the diesel-powered, north–south line was \"O-Train\". After construction started on a second, east–west light rail line (the Confederation Line), the O-Train name was applied to the entire system, and the north–south line was renamed the \"Trillium Line\".\n\nTicketing on the Trillium Line originally worked entirely on a proof-of-payment basis; there were no ticket barriers or turnstiles, and the driver did not check fares. Occasionally, OC Transpo Special Constables or other employees prompted passengers for proof-of-payment. Tickets can be purchased from a vending machine on the platform, and certain bus passes are also valid for the Trillium Line. Trillium Line tickets were exchanged for bus transfers upon boarding a bus. Although bus transfers can be used to board the O-Train, prepaid bus tickets cannot.\n\nThe European trains are narrower than the North American standard. In order to enable night-time use of the line by standard-width freight services, retractable platform extenders are mounted at each station (other than Bayview which is constructed on its own private rail spur). Passengers gain access to the Trillium Line on these extenders. If the line is used for freight, the extenders are retracted allowing a wider train to pass through the station. The extender interface with the train has been refined over time, and cyclists and wheelchair users now have no trouble accessing the train.\n\nThe service frequency of a train every fifteen minutes made it possible to run the line with a fleet of just three trains (of which only two were in service at any given time) and a single track, apart from passing sidings at Carleton station.\n\nThe Trillium Line hit the 1-millionth rider mark on May 29, 2002, the 5-millionth mark on January 21, 2005, and the 10-millionth in late 2010. In mid-2011, the Trillium Line carried an average of approximately 12,000 riders each day.\n\nIn June 2002, the O-Train Light Rail Transit project received the Canadian Urban Transit Association’s Corporate Innovation Award.\n\nOn January 16, 2003, the Ontario chapter of the American Public Works Association (APWA) presented the City of Ottawa, Canadian Pacific Railway and Morrison Hershfield with the APWA Public Works Project of the Year award in the transportation category. This award was established to highlight excellence in the management and administration of public works projects by recognizing the alliance between the managing agency, the consultant and the contractors who, working together, complete public works projects.\n\nA third award the Trillium Line light rail transit project received was in May 2003, in the sustainable transportation category of the FCM-CH2M Hill Sustainable Community Awards.\n\nThe main complaints about the Trillium Line pilot have revolved around its placement and ridership levels. The Trillium Line's route was determined by existing railway tracks, rather than the parts of the city that needed public transport, which would have required new tracks to be laid. Carleton University students, however, benefited from the Trillium Line pilot project, as it connected the university to the busy Ottawa Transitway system.\n\nThe other criticism is that there is very low ridership of the trains compared to some very crowded bus lines such as the 90–99 series routes. One fully loaded Trillium Line train carries 285 passengers compared to 131 passengers for an articulated bus. The O-Train schedule is limited by track capacity.\n\nIn July 2006, Ottawa City Council approved a north–south light rail expansion project. The project would have terminated diesel light rail service on the Trillium Line so as to reuse its right-of-way for a double-track, electric light rail line that would have extended west from the University of Ottawa to Bayview then south to Leitrim and then west to Barrhaven. However, in December 2006, Ottawa City Council cancelled this project, thus leaving the diesel-powered Trillium Line unchanged.\n\nOn May 18, 2011, OC Transpo approved a $200,000 study to expand the Trillium Line. The $59-million proposal included the purchase of six new trainsets and track improvements that would increase headways to eight minutes from fifteen. The project would finally cost $60.3million.\n\nIn mid-2013, service on the Trillium Line was suspended for four months to implement service and track improvements such as new station platforms and two new passing tracks (near Brookfield and Gladstone). Upgrades were also made to the signal system, train controls, stations, tracks and train yard. A new centralized traffic control system was installed to improve safety and efficiency. Six new Alstom Coradia LINT trainsets (replacing the three older Bombardier Talent units) and the two extra passing loops allowed the number of trains on the line to double to four.\n\nExpanded service began on March 2, 2015, but suffered numerous problems during the first week. Although the changes were intended to improve frequency to eight minutes, the Trillium Line would ultimately operate at twelve minute frequency. After the completion of the Stage 2 project, the line was originally planned to continue operating using single-car trains; however, because of the lower-than-intended frequency, the city was forced to adjust the Stage 2 plan to include longer trains and platforms to compensate.\n\nOn August 11, 2014, train C3 derailed while traveling northbound over the switch just south of Carleton Station. The cause was determined to be a faulty spring switch that had not closed properly as well as the operator failing to follow regulations and physically inspect the switch after spotting a signal irregularity. No serious injuries occurred as a result of the derailment, however train C3 received damage and was taken out of service. C3 was never repaired and never returned to service and as a result the line continued to operate with only two operational trains until the following March when the new Alstom LINT trains entered service. In June 2017, the spring switches at Carleton were replaced with powered switches.\n\nAs part of the city's Stage 2 LRT project, the Trillium Line will be extended in the south, including a branch to Macdonald–Cartier International Airport and the EY Centre, with four new stations at South Keys, Leitrim, Bowesville and Limebank in Riverside South. There will be a new passing loop at South Keys station and the track will be fully doubled from the Leitrim Road overpass to Limebank station. The full extension will be grade separated. In addition, two more stations will be built along the existing portion of the line at Gladstone and Walkley. The project will also include a number of other significant upgrades including the lengthening of all existing passing loops, the purchase of seven new trains, the doubling in length of all existing platforms, the grade separation of the Ellwood diamond to allow Via trains to cross underneath the Trillium Line, the rehabilitation of rail bridges over the Rideau River and of the Dow's Lake rail tunnel, the upgrading of the signalling system to allow the implementation of positive train control, the construction of several new pedestrian tunnels and overpasses, and numerous guideway and vehicle rehabilitation projects. The contract for this project was approved on March 7, 2019, by city council, with construction of the airport spur beginning in mid-2019. The project is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThe airport link will run from Macdonald–Cartier International Airport north to South Keys station, where riders will need to change trains to continue to Bayview station. South Keys station will feature an island platform to facilitate cross-platform transfers for passengers arriving from the airport branch to trains bound for Bayview station. The city is not contributing any money to this spur, with the funding instead coming from the federal and provincial governments, as well as the airport authority.\n\nOn February 22, 2019, the city announced that the selected proponent to construct the project was TransitNEXT, a wholly owned subsidiary of SNC-Lavalin. This decision was controversial as the federal government and SNC-Lavalin were involved in a political scandal at the time, which led to extra scrutiny by city councillors, with some calling for a delay on the vote to approve the contract in order to allow more time for review. Ultimately Council voted not to delay the approval and the contract was approved on March 7, 2019. It was later revealed that TransitNEXT's bid had not met the minimum technical scoring threshold in order to be considered, which continued the controversy. The city eventually explained that the decision to award the contract to TransitNEXT was done at the discretion of city staff to get a better deal for the city and was within the rules of the procurement process. An investigation conducted by the city's auditor general later confirmed that the authority delegated by council gave city staff sole discretion on whether to allow a bid to proceed even if it had not met the minimum scoring threshold, and that staff had otherwise correctly followed the entire procurement process that had been approved by council.\n\nWork on the Stage 2 extension began in mid-2019, starting with the clear-cutting of trees along the corridors that will be used by the extension. Construction of the airport spur is expected to be completed in 2020 to give the airport authority time to rebuild the terminal and connect it to the future station.\n\nExtending the Trillium Line across the Ottawa River into Gatineau across the Prince of Wales Bridge had been proposed as early as the original pilot project proposal. The city's certificate of fitness for the Trillium Line, issued by the Canadian Transportation Authority in 2001, indicates that it operates between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, despite the line never having actually operated across the river. The city even considered converting the rail bridge into a pedestrian crossing at one point. When the city announced the contract awards for Stage 2, it also presented a map of the O-Train network that included proposed extensions that would be a part of a Stage 3 phase, including extensions to Kanata, Barrhaven, and Gatineau. On September 24, 2019, the cities of Ottawa and Gatineau jointly announced that they no longer intended to use the Prince of Wales bridge for any kind of rail connection, citing capacity concerns at Bayview station. Despite the announcement, the future of the bridge remains uncertain since city staff later indicated that the bridge is still in the city's long term transit plans, though it could be converted for use as a pedestrian bridge in the interim. More on the future of the bridge as a rail link will be announced in the second quarter of 2020 when the city of Gatineau will present the results of a long-term transit study.\n\n, ticket barriers are installed and operational in all Line 2 stations. They were initially installed in all stations except for Bayview in order to test the hardware and software of the fare gate system before it was installed in all thirteen stations on the Line 1 Confederation Line.\n\nThe Trillium Line stations have large, bus-style sheltered waiting areas for passengers. All stations have level boarding platforms to allow for wheelchair access and easier boarding for all passengers. Elevators are available at Greenboro (for Transitway riders), Carling (for Line 2 riders) and Bayview (for train transfers within the fare-paid zone).\n\nThe Trillium Line initially used three Bombardier Talent diesel multiple unit (DMU) trains for service. Each train (numbered C1–C3) consisted of three cars, with the front and rear powered and the centre towed. The trains were originally ordered by Deutsche Bahn and later delivered to OC Transpo. After being retired in 2015, the units were put up for auction multiple times before eventually being sold for C$25,200 on December 14, 2018.\n\nIn September 2011, Alstom announced that it would deliver six new two-car Coradia LINT train sets in 2013; the trains were handed over to OC Transpo in June 2013. These trains were put into service on March 2, 2015, and the Bombardier Talent units were subsequently retired. \n\nOn May 3, 2018, it was announced that the city would be purchasing seven new Stadler FLIRT trains to use on the extended Trillium Line after the completion of Stage 2. These trains will be approximately long, which is double the length of the current Coradia LINT trains. The new trains will operate alongside coupled pairs of the existing LINT trains on the main line as part of a mixed fleet. These vehicles will be manufactured in Switzerland before being transported to Canada for final assembly. The trains will have a diesel-electric drive with the possibility of future electrification.\n\nTrain sets are stored at the Walkley Yard located northeast of the Greenboro station. Before their retirement, the Bombardier Talent trainsets were maintained by Bombardier Transportation at the Walkley facilities. Bombardier continues to perform maintenance of the Trillium Line fleet, which included standstill maintenance of the retired Bombardier Talent trains until March 8, 2018. The Walkley Yard was built in 1955 by the National Capital Commission for the Canadian National Railways and later sold to the Canadian Pacific Railway. The yard has enclosed buildings for repairs and outdoor storage tracks.\n\nAs part of the Stage 2 project, a new maintenance facility will be built adjacent and to the west of the existing facilities. The construction of the new yard facilities began in 2019.\n\n"}

He is currently the Elizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics at MIT. He was named Institute Professor in 2019.\n\nBorn to Armenian parents in Istanbul, Acemoglu completed his PhD at the London School of Economics (LSE) at 25. He lectured at LSE for a year before joining the MIT. He was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal in 2005. Acemoglu is best known for his work on political economy. He has authored hundreds of papers, many of which are co-authored with his long-time collaborators Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson. With Robinson, he authored \"Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy\" (2006) and \"Why Nations Fail\" (2012). The latter, an influential book on the role that institutions play in shaping nations' economic outcomes, prompted wide scholarly and media commentary. Described as a centrist, he believes in a regulated market economy. He regularly comments on political issues, economic inequality, and a variety of specific policies.\n\nAcemoglu ranked third, behind Paul Krugman and Greg Mankiw, in the list of \"Favorite Living Economists Under Age 60\" in a 2011 survey among American economists. In 2015 he was named the most cited economist of the past 10 years per Research Papers in Economics (RePEc) data.\n\nKamer Daron Acemoğlu was born in Istanbul, Turkey to Armenian parents on September 3, 1967. He is the only child of Kevork Acemoglu (1938−1988), a commercial lawyer and lecturer at Istanbul University, and Irma (d. 1991), principal of , an Armenian school in the Kadıköy district. He attended an Armenian school in Istanbul and graduated from Galatasaray High School in 1986. He became interested in politics and economics as a teenager. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in economics at the University of York in 1989, his Master of Science (in mathematical economics and econometrics) and PhD (in economics) from the London School of Economics (LSE), in 1990 and 1992, respectively. His doctoral thesis was titled \"Essays in Microfoundations of Macroeconomics: Contracts and Economic Performance.\" His doctoral advisor was Kevin W. S. Roberts. James Malcomson, one of his doctoral examiners at the LSE, said that even the weakest three of the seven chapters of his thesis were \"more than sufficient for the award of a PhD.\"\n\nArnold Kling called him a wunderkind due to his age of receiving a PhD; he became a Doctor at 25. \n\nAcemoglu is a naturalized US citizen. He is fluent in English and Turkish. He is married to Asuman \"Asu\" Ozdağlar, a professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and daughter of İsmail Özdağlar, a former Turkish government minister. Together they have authored several articles. As of 2015, they live in Newton, Massachusetts with their two sons (Arda and Aras).\n\nAcemoglu was a lecturer in economics at the LSE from 1992 to 1993. He began lecturing at the MIT in 1993, when he was appointed Assistant Professor of Economics. He was granted a tenure at MIT in 1998, and promoted to full professor in 2000. In 2004 he became Charles P. Kindleberger Professor of Applied Economics. Since 2010 Acemoglu has been the Elizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics at MIT. In July 2019 he was named Institute Professor, the highest faculty honor at MIT.\n\nAs of mid-2019 he has had over 60 PhD students. Among his doctoral students are Robert Shimer, Mark Aguiar, Pol Antràs, and Gabriel Carroll. \n\nIn 2014 he made $841,380, making him one of the top earners at MIT.\n\nHe is a fellow of the United States National Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Econometric Society, European Economic Association, and other learned societies. He is a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a Senior Fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He was the editor of \"Econometrica\", an academic journal published by the Econometric Society, from 2011 to 2015.\n\nAcemoglu has authored hundreds of academic papers. He noted that most of his research has been \"motivated by trying to understand the sources of poverty.\" His research includes a wide range of topics, including political economy, human capital theory, growth theory, economic development, innovation, labor economics, income and wage inequality, network economics, etc. He noted in 2011 that most his research of the past 15 years concerned with what can be broadly called political economy. He has made contribution to the labor economics field.\n\nAcemoglu has extensively collaborated with James A. Robinson, a British political scientist, since 1993. Acemoglu has described it as a \"very productive relationship.\" They have worked together on a number of articles and several books, most of which on the subject of growth and economic development. The two have also extensively collaborated with economist Simon Johnson.\n\nPublished by Cambridge University Press in 2006, \"Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy\" by Acemoglu and Robinson analyzes the creation and consolidation of democratic societies. They argue that \"democracy consolidates when elites do not have strong incentive to overthrow it. These processes depend on (1) the strength of civil society, (2) the structure of political institutions, (3) the nature of political and economic crises, (4) the level of economic inequality, (5) the structure of the economy, and (6) the form and extent of globalization.\"\n\nRomain Wacziarg praised the book and argued that its substantive contribution is the theoretical fusion of the Marxist dialectical materialism (\"institutional change results from distributional struggles between two distinct social groups, a rich ruling class and a poor majority, each of whose interests are shaped primarily by economic forces\") and the ideas of Barry Weingast and Douglass North, who argued that \"institutional reform can be a way for the elite to credibly commit to future policies by delegating their enactment to interests that will not wish to reverse them.\" William Easterly called it \"one of the most important contributions to the literature on the economics of democracy in a long time.\" Edward Glaeser described it as \"enormously significant\" work and a \"great contribution to the field.\"\n\nIn his 2012 book, \"Why Nations Fail\", coauthored with Robinson, Acemoglu argues that political and economic institutions are the prime factor in economic success and that \"development differences across countries are exclusively due to differences in political and economic institutions, and reject other theories that attribute some of the differences to culture, weather, geography or lack of knowledge about the best policies and practices.\" The book was written for the general audience. It was widely discussed by political analysts and commentators. Warren Bass wrote of it in \"The Washington Post\": \"bracing, garrulous, wildly ambitious and ultimately hopeful. It may, in fact, be a bit of a masterpiece.\"\n\nClive Crook wrote in \"Bloomberg News\" that the book deserves most of the \"lavish praise\" it received. In his review in \"Foreign Affairs\" Jeffrey Sachs criticized Acemoglu and Robinson for systematically ignoring factors such as domestic politics, geopolitics, technological discoveries, and natural resources. He also argued that the book's appeal was based on readers' desire to hear that \"Western democracy pays off not only politically but also economically.\" Bill Gates called the book a \"major disappointment\" and characterized the authors' analysis as \"vague and simplistic.\" Ryan Avent, an editor at \"The Economist\", responded that \"Acemoglu and Robinson might not be entirely right about why nations succeed or fail. But at least they're engaged with the right problem.\"\n\nAcemoglu is a follower of new institutional economics. Among economists who have influenced him are Joel Mokyr and Kenneth Sokoloff, Douglass North, Seymour Martin Lipset, Barrington Moore.\n\nJournalists and economists describe him as a centrist. Paul Abrams noted that \"Why Nations Fail\" was well-received by both liberal and conservative economists. Acemoglu's and Robinson's long-time collaborator Simon Johnson suggests that their \"point is not just about how things may become awful when the government goes off track (a right-wing point). They are also more deeply concerned about how powerful people fight to grab control of the state and otherwise compete to exert influence over the rest of society (a left-wing perspective).\" \n\nAcemoglu has praised the successes of the Progressive Era, and argued in favor of its replication. Johnson notes that for Acemoglu and Robinson a balance between the government and large private businesses is essential. Acemoglu argues that the market economy is the only system that creates prosperity. He believes in finding an appropriate balance between \"incentivizing creativity, hard work and risk-taking and creating the essential public services, social safety nets and equality of opportunity.\" For Acemoglu, markets work only with regulations and predictable laws and that all markets are regulated to some extent; it is only a matter of degree. He suggests that free markets are not unregulated markets. While he believes that property rights and private property are absolutely essential for prosperity, he has stated that \"these things are very political and the politics shouldn’t be one-sided.\"\n\nIn September 2008 Acemoglu signed a petition condemning the Bush administration's bailout plan of the U.S. financial system. As the main cause of the 2008 financial crisis he stated that policy makers were \"lured by ideological notions derived from Ayn Rand’s novels rather than economic theory\" and opined that \"In hindsight, we should not be surprised that unregulated profit-seeking individuals have taken risks from which they benefit and others lose.\" In an early analysis of the Great Recession, Acemoglu wrote: \"When channeled into profit-maximizing, competitive, and innovative behavior under the auspices of sound laws and regulations, greed can act as the engine of innovation and economic growth. But when unchecked by the appropriate institutions and regulations, it will degenerate into rent-seeking, corruption, and crime.\" He suggests that progressive tax may reduce the rent-seeking activities of those at the top of the income bracket. According to him the U.S. financial system has become increasingly concentrated due its high profitability and investment in high-risk assets. He voices doubt about the effectiveness of the Dodd–Frank Act in preventing the next financial collapse if the financial system continues on its current trajectory, especially what he calls the bonus culture. He argues that the heavy overrepresentation from the financial sector in the top 1% \"has been an outcome of the political processes that have removed all of the regulations in finance, and so created the platform for 40 percent of U.S. corporate profits to be in the financial sector.\" He argues that a platform, particularly in Wall Street, has been created \"where the ambition and greed of people, often men, has been channeled in a very anti-social, selfish and socially destructive direction.\"\n\nAcemoglu has voiced concerns regarding the increasing inequality in the United States, which, he argues, turns into political inequality which, in turn, undermines the inclusiveness of American institutions. In a 2012 interview Acemoglu identified societal polarization, caused by economic inequality, as the biggest problem for the United States. He argues that the political system is dominated by the wealthy, while the voices of ordinary Americans are not heard. According to him \"democracy ceases to function because some people have so much money they command greater power.\" He and Robinson wrote in 2012 that \"those who are further empowered politically will use this to gain a greater economic advantage by stacking the cards in their favor and increasing economic inequality yet further — a quintessential vicious circle.\" He states that he is comfortable with economic inequality which comes through different social contributions as it is a \"price that we pay for providing incentives for people to contribute to prosperity.\" However, high levels of inequality create problems as the rich who control significant portions of the societal resources use them to create an \"unequal distribution of political power.\" He sees the solution in increasing social mobility by \"providing an opportunity for the bottom to become rich, not forcing the rich to become poor.\"\n\nHe has praised the American tradition of vibrant protest movements dating back to Populists and Progressives. He has also praised Occupy Wall Street for \"putting the question of inequality on the agenda, but also for actually standing up for political equality.\" He notes that Occupy Wall Street brought the 1% to the attention of the wider public, academic attention was brought by Tony Atkinson, Thomas Piketty, and Emmanuel Saez.\n\nAcemoglu is in favor of raising and indexing the minimum wage. He argues that minimum wages and unemployment benefits \"shift the composition of employment toward high-wage jobs. Because the composition of jobs in the laissez-faire equilibrium is inefficiently biased toward low-wage jobs, these labor market regulations increase average labor productivity and may improve welfare.\" Furthermore, he argues that \"minimum wages can increase training of affected workers, by inducing firms to train their unskilled employees.\" \n\nAcemoglu believes that universal basic income is \"expensive and not generous enough\" and that a \"more efficient and generous social safety net is needed.\" He further called it a \"flawed idea\" and a \"poorly designed policy.\" He instead advocates for a \"guaranteed-income program would offer transfers only to individuals whose monthly income is below $1,000, thereby coming in at a mere fraction of a UBI’s cost.\" He calls for \"universal health care, more generous unemployment benefits, better-designed retraining programs, and an expanded earned income tax credit (EITC).\"\n\nAcemoglu et al. found that \"democracy has a significant and robust positive effect on GDP\" and suggest that \"democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20% in the long run.\" They also found that \"there is a significant and robust effect of democracy on tax revenues as a fraction of GDP, but no robust\nimpact on inequality.\"\n\nAccording to Acemoglu the three obstacles for economic growth under authoritarian regimes are the tendency of authoritarian regimes to become more authoritarian, their tendency to use power to halt \"Schumpeterian creative destruction, which is key to sustaining growth\" and the instability and uncertainty caused by internal conflicts. Authoritarian countries are, by definition, extractive. He believes that Saudi Arabia would be like a poor African country without the oil, while the \"only thing that is keeping [Russia] going is a big boom in natural resources and a clever handling of the media.\"\n\nHe believes that China has managed to achieve significant economic growth because it \"sort of picked up the low hanging fruit from the world technology frontier, but that sort of growth is not going to last until China goes to the next step, which is harnessing innovation,\" which he argues will be impossible \"unless economic institutions become even more open and the extractive political institutions in China will be a barrier to that.\" He and Robinson wrote for the \"HuffPost\" that the \"limited rights [China] affords its citizens places major restrictions on the country’s longer-term possibilities for prosperity.\"\n\nAcemoglu argues that socialist countries have not been successful in creating prosperity. He wrote that socialist regimes \"from Cuba to the eastern bloc have been disastrous both for economic prosperity and individual freedom.\" With Robinson, he argues that the Soviet Union and all of the other communist regimes were extractive from the beginning because of failure to provide economic incentives and concentrated political power in the \"hands of a very narrow elite and backed it up with coercion and force.\" \n\nIn a review written with Robinson, he argues that Thomas Piketty and Karl Marx are \"led astray\" due to their disregard for \"the key forces shaping how an economy functions: the endogenous evolution of technology and of the institutions and the political equilibrium that influence not only technology but also how markets function and how the gains from various different economic arrangements are distributed.\"\n\nIn 2019 Acemoglu argued in favor of social democracy. He stated:\nAcemoglu also noted that the economists of US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who is a self-proclaimed advocate of social democracy, \"don’t understand basic economics. They are not just dangerous, they are clueless.\"\n\nAcemoglu has argued that a \"tradition of strong labor movement or social democratic party, by constraining the actions of the social planner, can act as a commitment device to egalitarianism, inducing an equilibrium in which the country in question becomes the beneficiary from the asymmetric world equilibrium.\" According to Acemoglu and Robinson, unions, historically had a significant role in creating democracy, especially in western Europe, and maintaining a balance between political power of established business interests and political elites. \n\nAcemoglu and Philippe Aghion argued in 2001 that although deunionization in the US and UK since the 1980s is not the \"underlying cause of the increase in inequality\", it \"amplifies the direct effect of skill-biased technical change by removing the wage compression imposed by unions.\"\n\nIn a 2012 paper titled \"Can't We All Be More Like Scandinavians?\", co-written with Robinson and Thierry Verdier, he suggests that \"the more 'cutthroat' American society that makes possible the more 'cuddly' Scandinavian societies based on a comprehensive social safety net, the welfare state and more limited inequality.\" They concluded that \"all countries may want to be like the 'Scandinavians' with a more extensive safety net and a more egalitarian structure,\" however, if the United States, the \"cutthroat [capitalism] leader\", the economic growth of the entire world would be reduced. He argued against the US adopting the Nordic model in a 2015 op-ed for \"The New York Times\". He again argued, \"If the US increased taxation to Denmark levels, it would reduce rewards for entrepreneurship, with negative consequences for growth and prosperity.\" He praised the Scandinavian experience in poverty reduction, creation of a level playing field for its citizens, and higher social mobility.\n\n\"The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development\", co-written by Acemoglu, Robinson, Simon Johnson in 2001 is, by far, his most cited work. Graham Mallard described it as \"excellent example of his work: an influential paper that has led to much debate.\" They argue that Europeans set up extractive institutions in colonies where they did not settle, unlike in places where they did settle and that these institutions have persisted. They estimated that \"differences in institutions explain approximately three-quarters of the income per capita differences across from former colonies.\" According to Acemoglu and Robinson, the poverty of sub-Saharan Africa is a coincidence. Historical experience dominated by extractive institutions in these countries has created a vicious circle, which was exacerbated by the European colonization.\n\nAcemoglu argued just before the 2016 presidential election that the Democratic Party \"should seek a coalition that stands for the most vulnerable people in society\" which, he believes, \"could not stand by itself without the support of influential, well-off members of American society.\"\n\nIn an op-ed in \"Foreign Policy\" Acemoglu claimed President Donald Trump shared political goals and strategies of Hugo Chávez, Vladimir Putin, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan such as \"little respect for the rule of law or the independence of state institutions [...] a blurred vision of national and personal interests [...] little patience with criticism and a long-established strategy of rewarding loyalty, which can be seen in his high-level appointments to date. This is all topped by an unwavering belief in his abilities.\" In a 2019 interview Acemoglu stated that he sees similarities between Trump and the Republican Party and the Nazis: \"Surely, Trump and the Republicans are no Nazis. But they are exploiting the same political sentiment.\" He argues that Trump \"poses a great risk to U.S. democracy,\" because he is \"looking for a new order with elements of anti-liberalism, misinformation and a lax attitude to corruption. If he is re-elected next year, it will be the beginning of the end of American democracy.\"\n\nAcemoglu believes that nation-building by the West is no longer possible around the world because the West now lacks the resources and commitment that were present in post-World War II Germany and Japan and because countries where such work is required today (many in the Muslim- and Arab-majority countries) do not trust the West. He views the U.S. war on drugs as a \"total and very costly failure\" and supported the 2013 ballot referendum Colorado Amendment 64, a successful popular initiative that legalized the sale of recreational marijuana. According to him \"it is clear that public schools are failing and alternatives are necessary.\" In a 2016 interview he opined that the US infrastructure is in a \"pitiful state, with negative consequences for US economic growth.\"\n\nIn March 2011 Acemoglu was offered by Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu to become Turkey's permanent representative to the OECD in Paris, which he rejected in order to continue his academic career. It was seen in Armenia as a politically motivated move to earn \"political dividends\" on Armenian issues.\n\nAcemoglu opined that the Republic of Turkey, formed in 1923 by Atatürk, \"is very continuous with the Ottoman Empire.\" Although the shift from empire to republic brought some positive changes, he argues, the model was largely maintained by the reformers who took power, citing a persistent concentration of power and economic activity. He suggests that the Republican period has been characterized by an unwillingness to accept ethnic minorities. In 2014 Acemoglu condemned the widespread anti-Armenian rhetoric in Turkish textbooks, and demanded that the books be pulled from circulation.\n\nAcemoglu has criticized Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his government for its authoritarian rule. In a 2013 op-ed in \"The New York Times\", following the crackdown of Gezi Park protests, Acemoglu wrote that \"Even before the brutal suppression of the demonstrations, the belief that Turkey was on its way to becoming a mature democracy — a role model for the rest of the Middle East — had already become untenable.\" In a May 2014 op-ed \"Foreign Affairs\" Acemoglu wrote that the drift from democracy by Erdogan is lamentable, but an \"almost predictable, stage of Turkey’s democratic transition.\" In the late 2010s, Acemoglu often criticized Turkey's economic policies and consequently became popular with the opposition.\n\nAcemoglu, an ethnic Armenian, stated in a 2015 interview with the Armenian service of Voice of America, that he has always been interested in economic, political, and social developments in Armenia. Talking via video, Acemoglu partook in the Armenian Economic Association's annual conference in October 2013 held at the Yerevan State University, during which he argued that Armenia's problem is political, and not geographic, cultural, or geopolitical. He called for the Armenian government to be \"more responsive to the wishes of its citizens so that through that political process Armenia ceases to be an oligarchy.\" In a September 2016 conference in Toronto Acemoglu criticized the Armenian diaspora for legitimizing the successive governments in Armenia, especially when the rights of its citizens are violated and a wrong economic and political line is being followed for the country. In an April 2017 conference held by the USC Institute of Armenian Studies Acemoglu stated while \"Armenia could have looked much more like the Czech Republic or Estonia and what we got instead is a country that looks much more like Azerbaijan or Uzbekistan, which is a real shame.\" He suggested that in the immediate post-Soviet years Armenia was \"stronger and it's been getting worse and worse.\" He criticized the level of corruption of the government, which has systematically closed the political system.\n\nFollowing the 2018 Armenian revolution, opposition leader-turned-Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan wrote on his Facebook page that Acemoglu told him that he is ready to help Armenia to \"restore and develop\" its economy. Pashinyan and Acemoglu talked via the internet in June 2018. Acemoglu met with Deputy Prime Minister Tigran Avinyan in Boston in July 2019.\n\nAcemoglu predicted that the UK-EU deal is \"likely to be similar to the \"status quo ante\"\" and the Brexit referendum will not have a significant impact on the UK's real per-capita income.\n\nAcemoglu argued that the Greek government-debt crisis was caused by the \"terrible state of Greek institutions, and the clientelistic nature of its politics\" and that the country's problems are \"political not just macroeconomic.\" He identified lack of political integration within the EU as Greece's problem and that \"the only way forward for Europe is to have greater fiscal and banking integration or to abandon monetary integration.\" He criticized the policies of Syriza and stated that it is \"unclear whether default will help.\" On the 2015 bailout referendum, Acemoglu argued that \"Greece may be better off without the euro but political risks, especially with current government, would be great, so a 'no' [vote] is very risky.\"\n\nIn an op-ed for \"The Globe and Mail\" following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, Acemoglu advocated Ukraine \"to break with its past as quickly as possible. It needs to move away from Russia, politically and economically, even if that means an end to the natural-gas subsidies Russia has used to keep it in the position of a client state. Even more important is for Ukraine’s leaders to spread political power and economic benefits to the maximum number of its people, including Russian speakers.\"\n\nAccording to data collected by Research Papers in Economics (RePEc), Acemoglu was the most cited economist of the decade leading to 2015. According to Google Scholar his works (including co-authored works) have been cited nearly 135,800 times as of July 2019. He was listed 88th in \"Foreign Policy\"'s 2010 list of Top 100 Global Thinkers \"for showing that freedom is about more than markets.\" In a 2011 survey of 299 economics professors in the U.S. Acemoglu ranked third, behind Paul Krugman and Greg Mankiw, in the list of \"Favorite Living Economists Under Age 60\".\n\nMIT President L. Rafael Reif stated that Acemoglu \"embodies the essence of MIT: boldness, rigor and real-world impact.\" Francis Fukuyama has described Acemoglu and his long-time collaborator James A. Robinson as \"two of the world's leading experts on development.\" Clement Douglas wrote in the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis publication that the \"scope, depth and sheer volume of [his] scholarship are nothing short of breathtaking, verging on implausible.\" Angus Deaton called him a \"young superstar\" and noted that Acemoglu is \"a very good example of the way things ought to be going, which is you do history but you know enough mathematics to be able to model it too.\" Robert Shimer wrote, \"His unparalleled combination of originality, thoroughness, and prolificacy has propelled him to the frontier of each field that he has explored.\" Adam Davidson noted in 2012, the year \"Why Nations Fail\" was published, that Acemoglu \"is about as hot as economists get.\" Michael Mandel identified him in 2009 as a leader of innovation economics.\n\n\n\nAcemoglu has been awarded honorary degrees from the following universities: Utrecht University (2008), Bosporus University (2011), Bilkent University (2015), University of Bath (2017), ENS Paris-Saclay (2017), London Business School (2018), Boğaziçi University, and the University of Athens.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1803515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803515", "title": "Treaty of Fort Pitt", "text": "Treaty of Fort Pitt\n\nThe Treaty of Fort Pitt, also known as the Treaty With the Delawares, the Delaware Treaty, or the Fourth Treaty of Pittsburgh, was signed on September 17, 1778, and was the first written treaty between the new United States of America and any American Indians—the Lenape (Delaware Indians) in this case. Although many informal treaties were held with Native Americans during the American Revolution years of 1775–1783, this was the only one that resulted in a formal document. It was signed at Fort Pitt, Pennsylvania, site of present-day downtown Pittsburgh. It was essentially a formal treaty of alliance.\n\nThe treaty gave the United States permission to travel through Delaware territory and called for the Delawares to afford American troops whatever aid they might require in their war against Great Britain, including the use of their own warriors. The United States was planning to attack the British fort at Detroit, and Lenape friendship was essential for success.\n\nIn exchange, the United States promised \"articles of clothing, utensils and implements of war\", and to build a fort in Delaware country \"for the better security of the old men, women and children ... whilst their warriors are engaged against the common enemy.\" Although not part of the written treaty, the commissioners pointed out the American alliance with France and intended that the Delaware would become active allies in the war against the British.\n\nAccording to Daniel Richter in \"Facing East from Indian Country\", the Delaware perceived the agreement \"merely as free passage\" of revolutionary troops and the building of a protective fort for the defending white settlers. The American leaders intended to use the fort for offensive campaigns and wrote into the treaty that the Delaware would attack their native neighbors.\n\nThe treaty also recognized the Delawares as a sovereign nation and guaranteed their territorial rights, even encouraging the other Ohio Country Indian tribes friendly to the United States to form a state headed by the Delawares with representation in the Continental Congress. This extraordinary measure had little chance of success, and some suggest that the authors of the treaty were knowingly dishonest and deceitful. Others suggest that it was the Delaware chief White Eyes who proposed the measure, hoping that the Delaware and other tribes might become the fourteenth state of the United States. In any case, it was never acted upon by either the United States or the Delaware Indians.\n\nWithin a year the Delaware Indians were expressing grievances about the treaty. A delegation of Delawares visited Philadelphia in 1779 to explain their dissatisfaction to the Continental Congress, but nothing changed and peace between the United States and the Delaware Indians collapsed. White Eyes, the tribe's most outspoken ally of the United States, died in mysterious circumstances, and the Delawares soon joined the British in the war against the United States.\n\nSigners of the treaty were White Eyes, Captain Pipe (Hopocan), and John Kill Buck (Gelelemend) for the Lenape, and Andrew Lewis and Thomas Lewis for the Americans. Witnesses included Brigadier General Lachlan McIntosh, Colonel Daniel Brodhead, and Colonel William Crawford.\n\nThe 2013 Sacagawea dollar commemorates the Treaty of Fort Pitt. The coin depicts a turkey, a howling wolf, and a turtle—symbols of the Lenape. Its design was created by Susan Gamble as part of the Artistic Infusion Program, and engraved by Phebe Hemphill.\n\n"}

He played college football at the University of Miami, where he was recognized as a unanimous All-American, and was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals eighth overall in the 2005 NFL Draft. Rolle also played for the Chicago Bears and New York Giants, winning Super Bowl XLVI with New York in 2011.\n\nRolle was born in Homestead, Florida. He attended South Dade High School in Homestead, where he was a letterman in football and played for the South Dade Buccaneers high school football team. As a junior, he posted three interceptions, 85 tackles, and five pass deflections, and he returned three kickoffs and three punts for touchdowns. As a senior, he compiled three interceptions and 86 tackles; on offense, he had four receptions for 160 yards and a touchdown. In track & field, Rolle was a state qualifier in the hurdling events. At the 2000 FHSAA Outdoor State Finals, he took 10th in the 110-meter hurdles (15.46 s) and 15th in the 300-meter hurdles (41.84 s).\n\nRolle attended the University of Miami, where he played for coach Larry Coker's Miami Hurricanes football from 2001 to 2004. During his 2001 freshman season, Rolle was one of four true freshman to letter at Miami. He appeared in eight games, recording eight tackles and an interception. Rolle started eleven games as a sophomore in 2002, earning first-team All-Big East honors. Rolle totaled a career-high 66 tackles with two sacks, six tackles for a loss, seven pass deflections, and an interception for the season.\n\nIn 2003, as a junior, Rolle recorded 51 tackles, 3.5 tackles for a loss, seven broken up passes, and two interceptions on the year.

His notable senior performances included shutting down talented opposing receivers such as Larry Fitzgerald (three catches for 26 yards) and Calvin Johnson (two catches for 10 yards); both were future All-Americans.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals selected Rolle in the first round (eighth overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. Rolle was the second cornerback drafted in 2005, behind Adam \"Pacman\" Jones. \n\nOn August 6, 2005, the Arizona Cardinals signed Rolle to a six-year, $43 million contract that includes $7.75 million guaranteed.\n\nHead coach Dennis Green named Rolle a starting cornerback to begin the regular season, alongside David Macklin.

For example, assume that the standard cost of direct labor per unit of product A is 2.5 hours x $14 = $35. Assume further that during the month of March the company recorded 4500 hours of direct labor time. The actual cost of this labor time was $64,800, or an average of $14.40 per hour. The company produced 2000 units of product A during the month. The labor efficiency variance is (4500 - 5000) x $14 = $7000, where 5000 hours = 2.5 hours x 2000 units of output. This variance is favorable since the actual hours used are less than the standard hours allowed. This may be the result of efficient use of labor time due to automation or the use of improved production methods.\n"}

It contains the neighborhoods of Canaryville and Back of the Yards.\n\nThe area was home to the famous Union Stock Yards that were on Chicago's South Side until closed in 1971.\n\nBack of the Yards is an industrial and residential neighborhood so named because it was near the former Union Stock Yards, which employed thousands of European immigrants in the early 20th century. Life in this neighborhood was explored in Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel \"The Jungle\". The area was formerly part of the town of Lake until it was annexed by Chicago in 1889. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area was occupied largely by Eastern European immigrants and their descendants, who were predominantly ethnic Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak.\n\nIn the 1930s the activist Saul Alinsky did community organizing in this area, as its people suffered during the Great Depression. This work led to his founding the Industrial Areas Foundation in 1940, which trained community organizers.\n\nJane Jacobs in her 1961 book, \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\", cites the Back of the Yards as an area able to \"unslum\" in the 1960s, due to a beneficial set of circumstances. This included a stabilized community base with skilled members who were willing to trade work to upgrade housing, as well as active and well-led local social and political organizations. Jacobs often cited the Back of the Yards as a model for other depressed neighborhoods to follow to upgrade their communities.\n\nSome time after the 1970s, when the stockyard operations closed and the number of nearby jobs decreased, many people left to move to newer housing and work in the suburbs. The population of the neighborhood gradually reflected a new wave of settlement, predominantly Mexican-American.\n\nThe Canaryville neighborhood is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Chicago and, with neighboring Bridgeport, has a reputation for insularity or hostility to outsiders. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Chicago\", the neighborhood extends from 40th Street to 49th Street between Halsted Street and Parnell Avenue. The area's residents depended on the development, and suffered from the decline, of the livestock and meat packing industries. Its more successful members moved to newer housing, often in the suburbs, and other work in the post–World War II years.\n\nIts population in 2010 was about half the number in 1930. Historically, it has been known as an Irish American neighborhood. The Irish were the first major group of Europeans to immigrate to Chicago in the 19th century and defended their territory here against later arrivals, both Europeans, and African Americans who came north in the Great Migration. Its gangs were active in attacks on African Americans in the 1919 Race Riot. Since the late 20th century, Mexican immigrants and their descendants have also moved into the area.\n\nCanaryville's name may refer to the sparrows who fed in the stockyards and railroad cars in the late 19th century. The name may also refer to youth gangs in the neighborhood, who were known as \"wild canaries\".\n\nThe New City community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, New City cast 8,897 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 1,331 votes for Donald Trump (84.40% to 12.63%). In the 2012 presidential election, New City cast 9,053 votes for Barack Obama and cast 1,009 votes for Mitt Romney (89.36% to 9.96%).\n\n"}

Her first novel \"The Last Centennial\" was published by Dial Press in 1971, under the pen name Patricia Kilina, which she also used for her Ukrainian-language poetry. The book was described by \"Library Journal\" as \"an impressive first novel... almost Faulknerian in its depiction of the despoiling inheritors.\" She divorced Tarnawsky in 1973 and left the New York Group shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1974 Warren published her second novel, \"The Front Runner\". Told from the point of view of a gay track coach, the story chronicled his struggle to get a talented openly gay runner on the U.S. Olympic team, and to quash his own growing love for his protegé. The controversial book was the first contemporary gay fiction to make \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. The book sold ten million copies and was translated in ten languages. Two decades later, Warren added two sequels, \"Harlan's Race\" (1994) and \"Billy's Boy\" (1996). Warren also came out as lesbian in 1974.\n\nAs a runner herself, Warren was in 1968 one of the first women to participate in the Boston Marathon. She was part of a group who achieved wider recognition in the U.S. for female marathon runners. \n\nIn 1976, Warren published her third novel, \"The Fancy Dancer\". It is the story of a rookie priest in a dying rural parish who falls in love with a proud, gay half-breed with a criminal record and \"unlawful desires.\" It was the first bestseller to portray a gay priest and to explore gay life in a small town.\n\nIn 1978, came Warren's fourth novel, \"The Beauty Queen\". Also published by Morrow, this book was set in the New York City world where she'd spent many years. The story focused on a socially prominent Manhattan businessman, a closeted gay father trying to get up the courage to come out to his daughter, who had become a fiercely anti-gay born-again Christian politician.\n\nIn 1980, Warren left employment at the \"Digest\" to become a full-time writer. She moved back out West to pursue research on her next novel, a Western historical opus. It appeared from Ballantine in 1991 under the title \"One Is the Sun\". Eventually settling in southern California, she made the decision to go independent with book publishing. The result was Wildcat Press, which has published all her books since, including her 2001 novel, \"The Wild Man\", inspired by her years in Spain; she had traveled there regularly during Francisco Franco's regime when she was liaison to the \"Digest\"'s Spanish edition.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Warren became more active politically. In 1996-99, as a result of her concerns for LGBT youth, she volunteered as a commissioner of education in the Los Angeles Unified School District, serving on the Gay & Lesbian Education Commission and later the Human Relations Education Commission. In 2006, Warren hired veteran political consultant Neal Zaslavsky and announced her candidacy for City Council in West Hollywood, CA. Warren was unsuccessful in her run. \n\nWarren died on February 9, 2019 at the age of 82 at UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica after almost a three year battle with lung cancer.\n\nIn June 2019, Warren was one of the inaugural fifty American “pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes” inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City’s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, while The Wall’s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.\n\n"}

Stolaroff (August 20, 1920 – January 6, 2013) was an author and researcher who is best known for his studies involving psychedelic psychotherapy. He also conducted clinical studies that attempted to measure the effects of LSD, mescaline, and other drugs on creativity.\n\nStolaroff was born in Roswell, New Mexico. In 1941, he received a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. From 1942 through 1945, he held the title of Civilian Engineer at the Navy Department, Bureau of Ships. For the next fifteen years he worked for the recording equipment manufacturer Ampex, first as a senior design engineer, later as Director of Instrumentation Marketing, ultimately becoming responsible for long-range planning as Assistant to the President. \n\nAlong with fellow Ampex engineer, Harold Lindsey, Stolaroff co-designed the Ampex Model 200A reel-to-reel tape recorder, which was based on a German Magnetophon modified by the audio engineer Jack Mullin. With Bing Crosby arranging financial support for start-up manufacturing, the Ampex 200A went into production. Crosby gifted one of the first units to Les Paul, inventor of the solid-body electric guitar, who went on to produce numerous innovative recordings. Within three years most major recording studios had purchased an Ampex 200A. Songs such as Nat King Cole performing \"Unforgettable\" (1952 Capitol Records), Frank Sinatra performing \"Young at Heart\" (1953 Capitol Records), and Bill Haley performing \"(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock\" (1954 Decca Records), were recorded on an Ampex 200A. In 2008, Stolaroff was among the folks representing Ampex at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards Ceremony to accept the company's first Grammy Award for Technical Achievement, in honor of their contribution sixty years earlier of the Ampex 200A, which \"revolutionized the radio and recording industries\".\n\nIn 1960, Stolaroff established the International Foundation for Advanced Study in Menlo Park, a non-profit medical research organization. He served as its president until 1970. During this time, he was the executive administrator for a group conducting clinical studies with LSD and mescaline; the IFAS administered psychedelics to about 350 participants. Their research resulted in six published papers on psychedelic therapy with Stolaroff as co-author on most of the articles. The Foundation's clinical studies came to an end in 1965 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked research permits for psychedelics.\n\nStolaroff privately continued psychedelic research using unscheduled compounds from 1970 to 1986, until the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 was passed and halted his research again.\n\nStolaroff also worked as a Consulting Engineer and as a General Manager of \"Multi-Media Productions\", a manufacturer of social studies and sound filmstrips for public schools. He retired in 1979.\n\nHe published professional papers in the \"Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease\", \"Gnosis\", the \"Yearbook for Ethnomedicine and the Study of Consciousness\", and several other journals. Stolaroff served on the board of directors of the Albert Hofmann Foundation. He was also a consultant to the Heffter Research Institute and was on the Board of Advisors for the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics.\n\nStolaroff died on January 6, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1803590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803590", "title": "Job interview", "text": "Job interview\n\nA job interview is an interview consisting of a conversation between a job applicant and a representative of an employer which is conducted to assess whether the applicant should be hired. Interviews are one of the most popularly used devices for employee selection. Interviews vary in the extent to which the questions are structured, from a totally unstructured and free-wheeling conversation, to a structured interview in which an applicant is asked a predetermined list of questions in a specified order; structured interviews are usually more accurate predictors of which applicants will make suitable employees, according to research studies.\n\nA job interview typically precedes the hiring decision. The interview is usually preceded by the evaluation of submitted résumés from interested candidates, possibly by examining job applications or reading many resumes. Next, after this screening, a small number of candidates for interviews is selected.\n\nPotential job interview opportunities also include networking events and career fairs. The job interview is considered one of the most useful tools for evaluating potential employees. It also demands significant resources from the employer, yet has been demonstrated to be notoriously unreliable in identifying the optimal person for the job. An interview also allows the candidate to assess the corporate culture and demands of the job.\n\nMultiple rounds of job interviews and/or other candidate selection methods may be used where there are many candidates or the job is particularly challenging or desirable. Earlier rounds sometimes called 'screening interviews' may involve fewer staff from the employers and will typically be much shorter and less in-depth. An increasingly common initial interview approach is the telephone interview. This is especially common when the candidates do not live near the employer and has the advantage of keeping costs low for both sides. Since 2003, interviews have been held through video conferencing software, such as Skype. Once all candidates have been interviewed, the employer typically selects the most desirable candidate(s) and begins the negotiation of a job offer.\n\nResearchers have attempted to identify which interview strategies or \"constructs\" can help interviewers choose the best candidate. Research suggests that interviews capture a wide variety of applicant attributes. Constructs can be classified into three categories: job-relevant content, interviewee performance (behavior unrelated to the job but which influences the evaluation), and job-irrelevant interviewer biases.\n\nJob-relevant interview content\nInterview questions are generally designed to tap applicant attributes that are specifically relevant to the job for which the person is applying. The job-relevant applicant attributes that the questions purportedly assess are thought to be necessary for one to successfully perform on the job. The job-relevant constructs that have been assessed in the interview can be classified into three categories: general traits, experiential factors, and core job elements. The first category refers to relatively stable applicant traits. The second category refers to job knowledge that the applicant has acquired over time. The third category refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities associated with the job.\nGeneral traits:\nExperiential factors:\nCore job elements:\n\nInterviewee performance\nInterviewer evaluations of applicant responses also tend to be colored by how an applicant behaves in the interview. These behaviors may not be directly related to the constructs the interview questions were designed to assess, but can be related to aspects of the job for which they are applying. Applicants without realizing it may engage in a number of behaviors that influence ratings of their performance. The applicant may have acquired these behaviors during training or from previous interview experience. These interviewee performance constructs can also be classified into three categories: social effectiveness skills, interpersonal presentation, and personal/contextual factors.\nSocial effectiveness skills:\n\nInterpersonal presentation:\nPersonal/contextual factors:\n\nJob-irrelevant interviewer biases\nThe following are personal and demographic characteristics that can potentially influence interviewer evaluations of interviewee responses. These factors are typically not relevant to whether the individual can do the job (that is, not related to job performance), thus, their influence on interview ratings should be minimized or excluded. In fact, there are laws in many countries that prohibit consideration of many of these protected classes of people when making selection decisions. Using structured interviews with multiple interviewers coupled with training may help reduce the effect of the following characteristics on interview ratings. The list of job-irrelevant interviewer biases is presented below. \n\nThe extent to which ratings of interviewee performance reflect certain constructs varies widely depending on the level of structure of the interview, the kind of questions asked, interviewer or applicant biases, applicant professional dress or nonverbal behavior, and a host of other factors. For example, some research suggests that applicant's cognitive ability, education, training, and work experiences may be better captured in unstructured interviews, whereas applicant's job knowledge, organizational fit, interpersonal skills, and applied knowledge may be better captured in a structured interview.\n\nFurther, interviews are typically designed to assess a number of constructs. Given the social nature of the interview, applicant responses to interview questions and interviewer evaluations of those responses are sometimes influenced by constructs beyond those the questions were intended to assess, making it extremely difficult to tease out the specific constructs measured during the interview. Reducing the number of constructs the interview is intended to assess may help mitigate this issue. Moreover, of practical importance is whether the interview is a better measure of some constructs in comparison to paper and pencil tests of the same constructs. Indeed, certain constructs (mental ability and skills, experience) may be better measured with paper and pencil tests than during the interview, whereas personality-related constructs seem to be better measured during the interview in comparison to paper and pencil tests of the same personality constructs. In sum, the following is recommended: Interviews should be developed to assess the job relevant constructs identified in the job analysis.\n\nPerson-environment fit is often measured by organizations when hiring new employees. There are many types of Person-environment fit with the two most relevant for interviews being Person-job and Person-organization fit. Interviewers usually emphasis Person-job fit and ask twice as many questions about Person-job fit compared to Person-organization fit. Interviewers are more likely to give applicants with good Person-job fit a hiring recommendation compared to an applicant with good Person-organization fit.\n\nAn applicant's knowledge, skills, abilities, and other attributes (KSAOs) are the most commonly measured variables when interviewers assess Person-job fit. In one survey, all interviewers reported that their organization measures KSAOs to determine Person-job fit. The same study found that all interviewers used personality traits and 65% of the interviewers used personal values to measure Person-organization fit.\n\nDespite fit being a concern among organizations, how to determine fit and the types of questions to use varies. When interview fit questions were examined, only 4% of the questions used in interviews were similar across the majority of organizations. 22% of questions were commonly used by recruiters in some organizations. In contrast, 74% of the questions had no commonality between organizations. Although the idea of fit is similar in many organizations, the questions used and how that information is judged may be very different.\n\nPerson-job fit and Person-organization fit have different levels of importance at different stages of a multi-stage interview proves. Despite this, Person-job fit is considered of highest importance throughout the entire process. Organizations focus more on job-related skills early on to screen out potential unqualified candidates. Thus, more questions are devoted to Person-job fit during the initial interview stages. Once applicants have passed the initial stages, more questions are used for Person-organization fit in the final interview stages. Although there is more focus on Person-organization fit in these later stages, Person-job fit is still considered to be of greater importance.\n\nIn a single stage interview, both fits are assessed during a single interview. Interviewers still put more weight on Person-job fit questions over the Person-organization questions in these situations as well. Again, Person-job fit questions are used to screen out and reduce the number of applicants.\n\nPotential applicants also use job interviews to assess their fit within an organization. This can determine if an applicant will take a job offer when one is offered. When applicants assess their fit with an organization the experience they have during the job interview is the most influential.\n\nApplicants felt that they had highest fit with an organization when they could add information not covered during the interview that they wanted to share. Applicants also liked when they could ask questions about the organization. They also when they could ask follow up questions to ensure they answered the interviewer's questions to the level the interviewer wanted. Interviewer behaviors that encourage fit perceptions in applicants include complimenting applicants on their resume and thanking them for traveling to the interview. Applicants like to be given contact information if follow up information is needed, the interviewer making eye contact, and asking if the applicant was comfortable.\n\nThe Interviewer can discourage fit perceptions by how they act during an interview as well. the biggest negative behavior for applicants was the interviewer not knowing information about their organization. Without information about the organization, applicants cannot judge how well they fit. Another negative behavior is not knowing applicants’ background information during the interview. Interviewers can also hurt fit perception by being inattentive during the interview and not greeting the applicant.\n\nThere are some issues with fit perceptions in interviews. Applicants’ Person-organization fit scores can be altered by the amount of ingratiation done by the applicants. Interviewers skew their Person-organization fit scores the more ingratiation applicants do during an interview. By applicants emphasizing similarities between them and the interviewer this leads to a higher Person-organization fit perceptions by the interviewer. This higher perception of fit leads to a greater likelihood of the candidate being hired.\n\nOne way to think about the interview process is as three separate, albeit related, phases: (1) the preinterview phase which occurs before the interviewer and candidate meet, (2) the interview phase where the interview is conducted, and (3) the postinterview phase where the interviewer forms judgments of candidate qualifications and makes final decisions. Although separate, these three phases are related. That is, impressions interviewers form early on may affect how they view the person in a later phase.\n\nPreinterview phase:\nThe preinterview phase encompasses the information available to the interviewer beforehand (e.g., resumes, test scores, social networking site information) and the perceptions interviewers form about applicants from this information prior to the actual face-to-face interaction between the two individuals. In this phase, interviewers are likely to already have ideas about the characteristics that would make a person ideal or qualified for the position. Interviewers also have information about the applicant usually in the form of a resume, test scores, or prior contacts with the applicant. Interviewers then often integrate information that they have on an applicant with their ideas about the ideal employee to form a preinterview evaluation of the candidate. In this way, interviewers typically have an impression even before the actual face-to-face interview interaction. Nowadays with recent technological advancements, interviewers have an even larger amount of information available on some candidates. For example, interviewers can obtain information from search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo), blogs, and even social networks (e.g. Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter). While some of this information may be job-related, some of it may not be. In some cases, a review of Facebook may reveal undesirable behaviors such as drunkenness or drug use. Despite the relevance of the information, any information interviewers obtain about the applicant before the interview is likely to influence theirimpression of the candidate. Furthermore, researchers have found that what interviewers think about the applicant before the interview (preinterview phase) is related to how they evaluate the candidate after the interview, despite how the candidate may have performed during the interview.\n\nInterview phase:\nThe interview phase entails the actual conduct of the interview, the interaction between the interviewer and the applicant. Initial interviewer impressions about the applicant before the interview may influence the amount of time an interviewer spends in the interview with the applicant, the interviewer's behavior and questioning of the applicant, and the interviewer's postinterview evaluations. Preinterview impressions also can affect what the interviewer notices about the interviewee, recalls from the interview, and how an interviewer interprets what the applicant says and does in the interview.\n\nAs interviews are typically conducted face-to-face, over the phone, or through video conferencing (e.g. Skype), they are a social interaction between at least two individuals. Thus, the behavior of the interviewer during the interview likely \"leaks\" information to the interviewee. That is, you can sometimes tell during the interview whether the interviewer thinks positively or negatively about you. Knowing this information can actually affect how the applicant behaves, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy effect. For example, interviewees who feel the interviewer does not think they are qualified may be more anxious and feel they need to prove they are qualified. Such anxiety may hamper how well they actually perform and present themselves during the interview, fulfilling the original thoughts of the interviewer. Alternatively, interviewees who perceive an interviewer believes they are qualified for the job may feel more at ease and comfortable during the exchange, and consequently actually perform better in the interview. Because of the dynamic nature of the interview, the interaction between the behaviors and thoughts of both parties is a continuous process whereby information is processed and informs subsequent behavior, thoughts, and evaluations.\n\nPostinterview phase:\nAfter the interview is conducted, the interviewer must form an evaluation of the interviewee's qualifications for the position. The interviewer most likely takes into consideration all the information, even from the preinterview phase, and integrates it to form a postinterview evaluation of the applicant. In the final stage of the interview process, the interviewer uses his/her evaluation of the candidate (i.e., in the form of interview ratings or judgment) to make a final decision. Sometimes other selection tools (e.g., work samples, cognitive ability tests, personality tests) are used in combination with the interview to make final hiring decisions; however, interviews remain the most commonly used selection device in North America.\n\nFor interviewees:\nAlthough the description of the interview process above focuses on the perspective of the interviewer, job applicants also gather information on the job and/or organization and form impressions prior to the interview. The interview is a two-way exchange and applicants are also making decisions about whether the company is a good fit for them. Essentially, the process model illustrates that the interview is not an isolated interaction, but rather a complex process that begins with two parties forming judgments and gathering information, and ends with a final interviewer decision.\n\nThere are many types of interviews that organizations can conduct. What is the same across all interview types, however, is the idea of interview structure. How much an interview is structured, or developed and conducted the same way across all applicants, depends on the number of certain elements included in that interview. Overall, the interview can be standardized both with regard to the content (i.e., what questions are asked) and to the evaluative process (i.e., how the applicants’ responses to the questions are scored). When an interview is standardized, it increases the likelihood that an interviewee's ratings are due to the quality of his/her responses instead of non-job-related and often distracting factors, such as appearance. Interview structure is more appropriately thought to be on a continuum, ranging from completely unstructured to fully structured. However, structure is often treated as a having only two categories (that is, structured vs. unstructured), which many researchers believe to be too simple of an approach.\n\nUnstructured\n\nThe unstructured interview, or one that does not include a good number of standardization elements, is the most common form of interview today. Unstructured interviews are typically seen as free-flowing; the interviewer can swap out or change questions as he/she feels is best, and different interviewers may not rate or score applicant responses in the same way. There are also no directions put in place regarding how the interviewer and the interviewee should interact before, during, or after the interview. Unstructured interviews essentially allow the interviewer to conduct the interview however he or she thinks is best.\n\nGiven unstructured interviews can change based on who the interviewer might be, it is not surprising that unstructured interviews are typically preferred by interviewers. Interviewers tend to develop confidence in their ability to accurately rate interviewees, detect whether applicants are faking their answers, and trust their judgment about whether the person is a good candidate for the job. Unstructured interviews allow interviewers to do so more freely. Research suggests, however, that unstructured interviews are actually highly unreliable, or inconsistent between interviews. That means that two interviewers who conduct an interview with the same person may not agree and see the candidate the same way even if they were in the same interview with that applicant. Often interviewers who conduct unstructured interviews fail to identify the high-quality candidates for the job. See the section on interview structure issues for a more in-depth discussion.\n\nStructured\n\nInterview structure is the degree to which interviews are identical and conducted the same across applicants. Also known as guided, systematic, or patterned interviews, structured interviews aim to make both the content (the information addressed as well as the administration of the interaction) and the evaluation (how the applicant is scored) the same no matter what applicant is being interviewed. Specifically, researchers commonly address 15 elements that can be used to make the interview's content and evaluation process similar. An interview's degree of structure is often thought of as the extent to which these elements are included when conducting interviews.\n\nContent structure:\nEvaluation structure:\n\nMultiple research studies have shown that using these elements to design the interview increases the interview's ability to identify high-performing individuals. As mentioned, the structure of an interview is on a scale that ranges from unstructured to structured, but it remains unclear which or how many structure elements must be included before the interview can be considered ‘structured.’ Some researchers argue that including at least some, but not all, elements into the interview should be considered “semi-structured.” Others have attempted to create levels of structure, such as Huffcutt, Culbertson, and Weyhrauch's four levels of structure, which point to varying degrees of standardization in each level. Despite being difficult to say exactly what a structured interview is, structured interviews are widely seen as more preferred over unstructured interviews by organizations if an accurate and consistent measure of an applicant is desired.\n\nTypes of questions\n\nRegardless of interview structure, there are several types of questions interviewers ask applicants. Two major types that are used frequently and that have extensive empirical support are situational questions and behavioral questions (also known as patterned behavioral description interviews). Best practices include basing both types of questions on \"critical incidents\" that are required to perform the job but they differ in their focus (see below for descriptions). Critical incidents are relevant tasks that are required for the job and can be collected through interviews or surveys with current employees, managers, or subject matter experts. One of the first critical incidents techniques ever used in the United States Army asked combat veterans to report specific incidents of effective or ineffective behavior of a leader. The question posed to veterans was \"Describe the officer’s actions. What did he do?\" Their responses were compiled to create a factual definition or \"critical requirements\" of what an effective combat leader is.\n\nPrevious research has found mixed results regarding whether behavioral or situational questions will best predict future job performance of an applicant. It is likely that variables unique to each situation, such as the specific criteria being examined, the applicant's work experience, or the interviewee's nonverbal behavior make a difference with regard to which question type is the best. It is recommended to incorporate both situational and behavioral questions into the interview to get the best of both question types. The use of high-quality questions represents an element of structure, and is essential to ensure that candidates provide meaningful responses reflective of their capability to perform on the job.\n\nSituational interview questions ask job applicants to imagine a set of circumstances and then indicate how they would respond in that situation; hence, the questions are future oriented. One advantage of situational questions is that all interviewees respond to the same hypothetical situation rather than describe experiences unique to them from their past. Another advantage is that situational questions allow respondents who have had no direct job experience relevant to a particular question to provide a hypothetical response. Two core aspects of the SI are the development of situational dilemmas that employees encounter on the job, and a scoring guide to evaluate responses to each dilemma.\n\nBehavioral (experience-based or patterned behavioral) interviews are past-oriented in that they ask respondents to relate what they did in past jobs or life situations that are relevant to the particular job relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities required for success. The idea is that past behavior is the best predictor of future performance in similar situations. By asking questions about how job applicants have handled situations in the past that are similar to those they will face on the job, employers can gauge how they might perform in future situations.\n\nBehavioral interview questions include:\n\nExamples include the STAR and SOARA techniques.\n\nOther possible types of questions that may be asked alongside structured interview questions or in a separate interview include: background questions, job knowledge questions, and puzzle type questions. A brief explanation of each follows.\n\n\nA case interview is an interview form used mostly by management consulting firms and investment banks in which the job applicant is given a question, situation, problem or challenge and asked to resolve the situation. The case problem is often a business situation or a business case that the interviewer has worked on in real life.\nIn recent years, company in other sectors like Design, Architecture, Marketing, Advertising, Finance and Strategy have adopted a similar approach to interviewing candidates. Technology has transformed the Case-based and Technical interview process from a purely private in-person experience to an online exchange of job skills and endorsements.\n\nAnother type of job interview found throughout the professional and academic ranks is the \"panel interview\". In this type of interview the candidate is interviewed by a group of panelists representing the various stakeholders in the hiring process. Within this format there are several approaches to conducting the interview. Example formats include; \n\nThe benefits of the panel approach to interviewing include: time savings over serial interviewing, more focused interviews as there is often less time spend building rapport with small talk, and \"apples to apples\" comparison because each stake holder/interviewer/panelist gets to hear the answers to the same questions.\n\nIn the group interview, multiple applicants are interviewed at one time by one or more interviewers. This type of interview can be used for selection, promotion, or assessment of team skills. Interviewers may also use a group interview to assess an applicant's stress management skills or assertiveness because in such a group setting the applicant will be surrounded by other applicants who also want to get the job. Group interviews can be less costly than one-on-one or panel interviews, especially when many applicants need to be interviewed in a short amount of time. In addition, because fewer interviewers are needed, fewer interviewers need to be trained. These positive qualities of the group interview have made them more popular.\n\nDespite the potential benefits to the group interview, there are problems with this interview format. In group interviews the interviewer has to multitask more than when interviewing one applicant at a time. Interviewers in one-on-one interviews are already busy doing many things. These include attending to what applicants are saying and how they are acting, taking notes, rating applicant responses to questions, and managing what they say and how they act. Interviewing more than one applicant at a time makes it more challenging for the interviewer. This can negatively affect that interviewer and his/her job as interviewer. Another problem with group interviews is that applicants who get questioned later in the interview have more of a chance to think about how to answer the questions already asked by the interviewer. This can give applicants questioned later in the interview an advantage over the earlier-questioned applicants. These problems can make it less likely for group interviews to accurately predict who will perform well on the job.\n\nGroup interviews have not been studied as much as one-on-one interviews, but the research that has been done suggests that in the field of education group interviews can be an effective method of selection. For example, a 2016 study found that applicants for teaching jobs thought that the group interview was fair. A 2006 study found conflicting findings. These include that applicants in a group interview who were questioned later in the interview gave more complete and higher quality responses and that group interviews were seen as not fair. They also found that group interviews were not as effective as one-on-one interviews. Further research needs to be conducted to more extensively evaluate the group interview's usefulness for various purposes. This research needs to be done across various domains outside of the education sector. Research also needs to clarify conflicting findings by determining in which situations study results can be applied.\n\nStress interviews are still in common use. One type of stress interview is where the employer uses a succession of interviewers (one at a time or \"en masse\") whose mission is to intimidate the candidate and keep him/her off-balance. The ostensible purpose of this interview: to find out how the candidate handles stress. Stress interviews might involve testing an applicant's behavior in a busy environment. Questions about handling work overload, dealing with multiple projects, and handling conflict are typical.\n\nAnother type of stress interview may involve only a single interviewer who behaves in an uninterested or hostile manner. For example, the interviewer may not make eye contact, may roll his eyes or sigh at the candidate's answers, interrupt, turn his back, take phone calls during the interview, or ask questions in a demeaning or challenging style. The goal is to assess how the interviewee handles pressure or to purposely evoke emotional responses. This technique was also used in research protocols studying stress and type A (coronary-prone) behavior because it would evoke hostility and even changes in blood pressure and heart rate in study subjects. The key to success for the candidate is to de-personalize the process. The interviewer is acting a role, deliberately and calculatedly trying to \"rattle the cage\". Once the candidate realizes that there is nothing personal behind the interviewer's approach, it is easier to handle the questions with aplomb.\n\nExample stress interview questions:\nCandidates may also be asked to deliver a presentation as part of the selection process. One stress technique is to tell the applicant that they have 20 minutes to prepare a presentation, and then come back to room five minutes later and demand that the presentation be given immediately. The \"Platform Test\" method involves having the candidate make a presentation to both the selection panel and other candidates for the same job. This is obviously highly stressful and is therefore useful as a predictor of how the candidate will perform under similar circumstances on the job. Selection processes in academic, training, airline, legal and teaching circles frequently involve presentations of this sort. \n\nThis kind of interview focuses on problem solving and creativity. The questions aim at the interviewee's problem-solving skills and likely show their ability in solving the challenges faced in the job through creativity. Technical interviews are being conducted online at progressive companies before in-person talks as a way to screen job applicants.\n\nAdvancements in technology along with increased usage has led to interviews becoming more common through a telephone interview and through videoconferencing than face-to-face. Companies utilize technology in interviews due to their cheap costs, time-saving benefits, and their ease of use.\nAlso, technology enables a company to recruit more applicants from further away. Although they are being utilized more, it is still not fully understood how technology may affect how well interviewers select the best person for the job when compared to in-person interviews.\n\nMedia richness theory states that more detailed forms of communication will be able to better convey complex information. The ability to convey this complexity allows more media-rich forms of communication to better handle uncertainty (like what can occur in an interview) than shallower and less detailed communication mediums. Thus, in the job interview context, a face-to-face interview would be more media rich than a video interview due to the amount of data that can be more easily communicated. Verbal and nonverbal cues are read more in the moment and in relation to what else is happening in the interview. A video interview may have a lag between the two participants. Poor latency can influence the understanding of verbal and nonverbal behaviors, as small differences in the timing of behaviors can change their perception. Likewise, behaviors such as eye contact may not work as well. A video interview would be more media rich than a telephone interview due to the inclusion of both visual and audio data. Thus, in a more media-rich interview, interviewers have more ways to gather, remember, and interpret the data they gain about the applicants.\n\nSo are these new types of technology interviews better? Research on different interview methods has examined this question using media richness theory. According to the theory, interviews with more richness are expected to result in a better outcome. In general, studies have found results are consistent with media richness theory. Applicants’ interview scores and hiring ratings have been found to be worse in phone and video interviews than in face-to-face interviews. Applicants are also seen as less likable and were less likely to be endorsed for jobs in interviews using video. Applicants have had a say too. They think that interviews using technology are less fair and less job-related. From the interviewers’ view, there are difficulties for the interviewer as well. Interviewers are seen as less friendly in video interviews. Furthermore, applicants are more likely to accept a job after a face-to-face interview than after a telephone or video interview. Due to these findings, companies should weigh the costs and benefits of using technology over face-to-face interviews when deciding on selection methods.\n\nWhile preparing for an interview, prospective employees usually look at what the job posting or job description says in order to get a better understanding of what is expected of them should they get hired. Exceptionally good interviewees look at the wants and needs of a job posting and show off how good they are at those abilities during the interview to impress the interviewer and increase their chances of getting a job.\n\nResearching the company itself is also a good way for interviewees to impress lots of people during an interview. It shows the interviewer that the interviewee is not only knowledgeable about the company's goals and objectives, but also that the interviewee has done their homework and that they make a great effort when they are given an assignment. Researching about the company makes sure that employees are not entirely clueless about the company they are applying for, and at the end of the interview, the interviewee might ask some questions to the interviewer about the company, either to learn more information or to clarify on some points that they might have found during their research. In any case, it impresses the interviewer and it shows that the interviewee is willing to learn more about the company.\n\nMost interviewees also find that practising answering the most common questions asked in interviews helps them prepare for the real one. It minimizes the chance of their being caught off-guard regarding certain questions, prepares their minds to convey the right information in the hopes of impressing the interviewer, and also makes sure that they do not accidentally say something that might not be suitable in an interview situation.\n\nInterviewees are generally dressed properly in business attire for the interview, so as to look professional in the eyes of the interviewer. They also bring their résumé, cover letter and references to the interview to supply the interviewer the information they need, and to also cover them in case they forgot to bring any of the papers. Items like cellphones, a cup of coffee and chewing gum are not recommended to bring to an interview, as it can lead to the interviewer perceiving the interviewee as unprofessional and in some cases, even rude.\n\nAbove all, interviewees should be confident and courteous to the interviewer, as they are taking their time off work to participate in the interview. An interview is often the first time an interviewer looks at the interviewee first hand, so it is important to make a good first impression.\n\nIt may not only be what you say in an interview that matters, but also how you say it (e.g., how fast you speak) and how you behave during the interview (e.g., hand gestures, eye contact). In other words, although applicants’ responses to interview questions influence interview ratings, their nonverbal behaviors may also affect interviewer judgments. Nonverbal behaviors can be divided into two main categories: vocal cues (e.g., articulation, pitch, fluency, frequency of pauses, speed, etc.) and visual cues (e.g., smiling, eye contact, body orientation and lean, hand movement, posture, etc.). Oftentimes physical attractiveness is included as part of nonverbal behavior as well. There is some debate about how large a role nonverbal behaviors may play in the interview. Some researchers maintain that nonverbal behaviors affect interview ratings a great deal, while others have found that they have a relatively small impact on interview outcomes, especially when considered with applicant qualifications presented in résumés. The relationship between nonverbal behavior and interview outcomes is also stronger in structured interviews than unstructured, and stronger when interviewees’ answers are of high quality.\n\nApplicants’ nonverbal behaviors may sway interview ratings through the inferences interviewers make about the applicant based on their behavior. For instance, applicants who engage in positive nonverbal behaviors such as smiling and leaning forward are perceived as more likable, trustworthy, credible, warmer, successful, qualified, motivated, competent, and socially skilled. These applicants are also predicted to be better accepted and more satisfied with the organization if hired.\n\nApplicants’ verbal responses and their nonverbal behavior may convey some of the same information about the applicant. However, despite any shared information between content and nonverbal behavior, it is clear that nonverbal behaviors do predict interview ratings to an extent beyond the content of what was said, and thus it is essential that applicants and interviewers alike are aware of their impact. You may want to be careful of what you may be communicating through the nonverbal behaviors you display.\n\nTo hire the best applicants for the job, interviewers form judgments, sometimes using applicants’ physical attractiveness. That is, physical attractiveness is usually not necessarily related to how well one can do the job, yet has been found to influence interviewer evaluations and judgments about how suitable an applicant is for the job. Once individuals are categorized as attractive or unattractive, interviewers may have expectations about physically attractive and physically unattractive individuals and then judge applicants based on how well they fit those expectations. As a result, it typically turns out that interviewers will judge attractive individuals more favorably on job-related factors than they judge unattractive individuals.\nPeople generally agree on who is and who is not attractive and attractive individuals are judged and treated more positively than unattractive individuals. For example, people who think another is physically attractive tend to have positive initial impressions of that person (even before formally meeting them), perceive the person to be smart, socially competent, and have good social skills and general mental health.\n\nWithin the business domain, physically attractive individuals have been shown to have an advantage over unattractive individuals in numerous ways, that include, but are not limited to, perceived job qualifications, hiring recommendations, predicted job success, and compensation levels. As noted by several researchers, attractiveness may not be the most influential determinant of personnel decisions, but may be a deciding factor when applicants possess similar levels of qualifications. In addition, attractiveness does not provide an advantage if the applicants in the pool are of high quality, but it does provide an advantage in increased hiring rates and more positive job-related outcomes for attractive individuals when applicant quality is low and average.\n\nVocal Attractiveness\nJust as physical attractiveness is a visual cue, vocal attractiveness is an auditory cue and can lead to differing interviewer evaluations in the interview as well. Vocal attractiveness, defined as an appealing mix of speech rate, loudness, pitch, and variability, has been found to be favorably related to interview ratings and job performance. In addition, the personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness predict performance more strongly for people with more attractive voices compared to those with less attractive voices.\n\nAs important as it is to understand how physical attractiveness can influence the judgments, behaviors, and final decisions of interviewers, it is equally important to find ways to decrease potential bias in the job interview. Conducting an interview with elements of structure is a one possible way to decrease bias.\n\nAn abundance of information is available to instruct interviewees on strategies for improving their performance in a job interview. Information used by interviewees comes from a variety of sources ranging from popular how-to books to formal coaching programs, sometimes even provided by the hiring organization. Within the more formal coaching programs, there are two general types of coaching. One type of coaching is designed to teach interviewees how to perform better in the interview by focusing on how to behave and present oneself. This type of coaching is focused on improving aspects of the interview that are not necessarily related to the specific elements of performing the job tasks. This type of coaching could include how to dress, how to display nonverbal behaviors (head nods, smiling, eye contact), verbal cues (how fast to speak, speech volume, articulation, pitch), and impression management tactics. Another type of coaching is designed to focus interviewees on the content specifically relevant to describing one's qualifications for the job, in order to help improve their answers to interview questions. This coaching, therefore, focuses on improving the interviewee's understanding of the skills, abilities, and traits the interviewer is attempting to assess, and responding with relevant experience that demonstrates these skills. For example, this type of coaching might teach an interviewee to use the STAR approach for answering behavioral interview questions.\n\nA coaching program might include several sections focusing on various aspects of the interview. It could include a section designed to introduce interviewees to the interview process, and explain how this process works (e.g., administration of interview, interview day logistics, different types of interviews, advantages of structured interviews). It could also include a section designed to provide feedback to help the interviewee to improve their performance in the interview, as well as a section involving practice answering example interview questions. An additional section providing general interview tips about how to behave and present oneself could also be included.\n\nIt is useful to consider coaching in the context of the competing goals of the interviewer and interviewee. The interviewee's goal is typically to perform well (i.e. obtain high interview ratings), in order to get hired. On the other hand, the interviewer's goal is to obtain job-relevant information, in order to determine whether the applicant has the skills, abilities, and traits believed by the organization to be indicators of successful job performance. Research has shown that how well an applicant does in the interview can be enhanced with coaching. The effectiveness of coaching is due, in part, to increasing the interviewee's knowledge, which in turn results in better interview performance. Interviewee knowledge refers to knowledge about the interview, such as the types of questions that will be asked, and the content that the interviewer is attempting to assess. Research has also shown that coaching can increase the likelihood that interviewers using a structured interview will accurately choose those individuals who will ultimately be most successful on the job (i.e., increase reliability and validity of the structured interview). Additionally, research has shown that interviewees tend to have positive reactions to coaching, which is often an underlying goal of an interview. Based on research thus far, the effects of coaching tend to be positive for both interviewees and interviewers.\n\nInterviewers should be aware that applicants can fake their responses during the job interview. Such applicant faking can influence interview outcomes when present. One concept related to faking is impression management (IM; when you intend or do not intend to influence how favorably you are seen during interactions). Impression management can be either honest or deceptive. Honest IM tactics are used to frankly describe favorable experiences, achievements and job-related abilities. Deceptive IM tactics are used to embellish or create an ideal image for the job in question. Honest IM tactics such as self-promotion (positively highlighting past achievements and experiences) may be considered necessary by interviewers in the interview context. Consequently, candidates who do not use these tactics may be viewed as disinterested in the job. This can lead to less favorable ratings. Faking can then be defined as \"deceptive impression management or the intentional distortion of answers in the interview in order to get better interview ratings and/or otherwise create favorable perceptions\". Thus, faking in the employment interview is intentional, deceptive, and aimed at improving perceptions of performance.\n\nFaking in the employment interview can be broken down into four elements:\n\nOf all of the various faking behaviors listed, ingratiation tactics were found to be the most prevalent in the employment interview, while flat out making up answers or claiming others’ experiences as one's own is the least common. However, fabricating true skills appears to be at least somewhat prevalent in employment interviews. One study found that over 80% of participants lied about job-related skills in the interview, presumably to compensate for a lack of job-required skills/traits and further their chances for employment.\n\nMost importantly, faking behaviors have been shown to affect outcomes of employment interviews. For example, the probability of getting another interview or job offer increases when interviewees make up answers.\n\nDifferent interview characteristics also seem to impact the likelihood of faking. Faking behavior is less prevalent, for instance, in past behavioral interviews than in situational interviews, although follow-up questions increased faking behaviors in both types of interviews. Therefore, if practitioners are interested in decreasing faking behaviors among job candidates in employment interview settings, they should utilize structured, past behavioral interviews and avoid the use of probes or follow-up questions.\n\nInterviewees may differ on any number of dimensions commonly assessed by job interviews and evidence suggests that these differences affect interview ratings. Many interviews are designed to measure some specific differences between applicants, or individual difference variables, such as Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities needed to do the job well. Other individual differences can affect how interviewers rate the applicants even if that characteristic is not meant to be assessed by the interview questions. For instance, General Mental Ability G factor (psychometrics) is moderately related to structured interview ratings and strongly related to structured interviews using behavioral description and situational judgment interview questions, because they are more cognitively intensive interview types. Other individual differences between people, such as extraversion and emotional intelligence, are also commonly measured during a job interview because they are related to verbal ability, which may be useful for jobs that involve interacting with people.\n\nIndividuals who are high in Machiavellianism may be more willing and more skilled at faking and less likely to give honest answers during interviews. Individuals high in Machiavellianism have stronger intentions to use faking in interviews compared to psychopaths or narcissists and are also more likely to see the use of faking in interviews as fair. Men and women high in Machiavellianism may use different tactics to influence interviewers. In one study, which examined the how much applicants allowed the interviewers to direct the topics covered during the interview, women high Machiavellianism tended to allow interviewers more freedom to direct the content of the interview. Men high in Machiavellianism, on the other hand, gave interviewers the least amount of freedom in directing the content of the interview. Men high in Machiavellianism were also more likely to make-up information about themselves or their experiences during job interviews. Thus, while individuals high in Machiavellianism may appear to do well in interviews, this seems to be largely because they give untrue responses and because they want to control interpersonal interactions.\n\nNarcissists typically perform well at job interviews, with narcissists receiving more favorable hiring ratings from interviewers than individuals who are not narcissists. Even more experienced and trained raters evaluate narcissists more favorably. This is perhaps because interviews are one of the few social situations where narcissistic behaviors, such as boasting actually create a positive impression, though favorable impressions of narcissists are often short-lived. Interviewers’ initial impressions of narcissistic applicants are formed primarily on the basis of highly visible cues, which makes them susceptible to biases. Narcissists are more skilled at displaying likable cues, which lead to more positive first impressions, regardless of their long-term likability or job performance. Upon first meeting narcissists, people often rate them as more agreeable, competent, open, entertaining, and well-adjusted. Narcissists also tend to be neater and flashier dressers, display friendlier facial expressions, and exhibit more self-assured body movements.\nImportantly, while narcissistic individuals may rate their own job performance more favorably, studies show that narcissism is not related to job performance.\nThus, while narcissists may seem to perform better and even be rated as performing better in interviews, these more favorable interview ratings are not predictive of favorable job performance, as narcissists do not actually perform better in their jobs than non-narcissists.\n\nCorporate psychopaths are readily recruited into organizations because they make a distinctly positive impression at interviews. They appear to be alert, friendly and easy to get along with and talk to. They\nlook like they are of good ability, emotionally well adjusted and reasonable, and these traits make them attractive to those in charge of hiring staff within organizations. Unlike narcissists, psychopaths are better able to create long-lasting favorable first impressions, though people may still eventually see through their facades. Psychopaths’ undesirable personality traits may be easily misperceived by even skilled interviewers. For instance, their irresponsibility may be misconstrued by interviewers as risk-taking or entrepreneurial spirit. Their thrill-seeking tendencies may be conveyed as high energy and enthusiasm for the job or work. Their superficial charm may be misinterpreted by interviewers as charisma. It is worth noting that psychopaths are not only accomplished liars, they are also more likely to lie in interviews. For instance, psychopaths may create fictitious work experiences or resumes. They may also fabricate credentials such as diplomas, certifications, or awards. Thus, in addition to seeming competent and likable in interviews, psychopaths are also more likely to outright make-up information during interviews than non-psychopaths.\n\nThere are many differences about interviewers that may affect how well they conduct an interview and make decisions about applicants. A few of them are how much experience they have as an interviewer, their personality, and intelligence. To date, it is not clear how experience affects the results of interviews. In some cases, prior experience as an interviewer leads them to use more of the information provided by the applicant to decide if an applicant is right for the job intelligence. In other cases, the experience of the interviewer did not help them make more accurate decisions. One reason for the different results could be the type of experience the interviewer had. Also, other differences in the interviewer, such as personality or intelligence, could be a reason why results vary.\n\nThe mental ability of interviewers may play a role in how good they are as interviewers. Higher mental ability is important because during the interview, a lot of information needs to be processed – what the applicant said, what they meant, what it means for how they can do the job, etc. Research has shown that those higher in general mental ability were more accurate when judging the personality of others. Also, interviewers who have higher social intelligence and emotional intelligence seem to do a better job of understanding how an applicant behaves in an interview and what that means for how they will act once on the job. These abilities do not appear to be enough on their own to make accurate judgements.\n\nThe personality of the interviewer may also affect the ratings they give applicants. There are many ways that personality and social skills can impact one's ability to be a good judge or interviewer. Some of the specific social skills good judges display are warmth, interest in engaging with others, and eye contact. Interviewers who display warm behaviors, such as smiling and leaning toward the applicant, are rated more positively than those who do not act this way or show cold behaviors. Interviewers who prefer to engage with others also tend to judge applicants more accurately. It is likely that these people are using information from their own personalities as well as how they see people in general to help them be more accurate.\n\nThere is extant data which puts into question the value of job interviews as a tool for selecting employees. Where the aim of a job interview is ostensibly to choose a candidate who will perform well in the job role, other methods of selection provide greater predictive power and often lower costs.\n\nAs discussed previously, interviews with more structure are considered best practice, as they tend to result in much better decisions about who will be a good performing employee than interviews with less structure. Structure in an interview can be compared to the standardization of a typical paper and pencil test: It would be considered unfair if every test taker were given different questions and a different number of questions on an exam, or if their answers were each graded differently. Yet this is exactly what occurs in an unstructured interview; interviewers decide the number and content of questions, rate responses using whatever strategy they want (e.g., relying on intuition, or using overall ratings at the end of the interview rather than after each time the applicant responds), and may score some applicants more harshly than others. Thus, interviewers who do not consider at least a moderate amount of structure may make it hard for an organization's interview to effectively select candidates that best fit the work needs of the organization.\n\nIn terms of reliability, meta-analytic results provided evidence that interviews can have acceptable levels of interrater reliability, or consistent ratings across interviewers interrater reliability (i.e. .75 or above), when a structured panel interview is used. In terms of criterion-related validity, or how well the interview predicts later job performance criterion validity, meta-analytic results have shown that when compared to unstructured interviews, structured interviews have higher validities, with values ranging from .20-.57 (on a scale from 0 to 1), with validity coefficients increasing with higher degrees of structure. That is, as the degree of structure in an interview increases, the more likely interviewers can successfully predict how well the person will do on the job, especially when compared to unstructured interviews. In fact, one structured interview that included a) a predetermined set of questions that interviewers were able to choose from, and b) interviewer scoring of applicant answers after each individual question using previously created benchmark answers, showed validity levels comparable to cognitive ability tests (traditionally one of the best predictors of job performance) for entry level jobs.\n\nHonesty and integrity are attributes that can be very hard to determine using a formal job interview process: the competitive environment of the job interview may in fact promote dishonesty. Some experts on job interviews express a degree of cynicism towards the process. \n\nApplicant reactions to the interview process include specific factors such as; fairness, emotional responses, and attitudes toward the interviewer or the organization. Though the applicant's perception of the interview process may not influence the interviewer(s) ability to distinguish between individuals' suitability, applicants reactions are important as those who react negatively to the selection process are more likely to withdraw from the selection process. They are less likely to accept a job offer, apply on future occasions, or to speak highly of the organization to others and to be a customer of that business. Compared to other selection methods, such as personality or cognitive ability tests, applicants, from different cultures may have positive opinions about interviews.\n\nInterview design can influence applicants' positive and negative reactions, though research findings on applicants preferences for structured compared to unstructured interviews appear contradictory. Applicants' negative reactions to structured interviews may be reduced by providing information about the job and organization. Providing interview questions to applicants before the interview, or telling them how their answers will be evaluated, are also received positively.\n\nThe type of questions asked can affect applicant reactions. General questions are viewed more positively than situational or behavioral questions and 'puzzle' interview questions may be perceived as negative being perceived unrelated to the job, unfair, or unclear how to answer. Using questions that discriminate unfairly in law unsurprisingly are viewed negatively with applicants less likely to accept a job offer, or to recommend the organization to others.\n\nSome of the questions and concerns on the mind of the hiring manager include:\n\n\nA sample of intention behind questions asked for understanding observable responses, displayed character, and underlying motivation:\n\n\nThe 'friendliness' of the interviewer may be equated to fairness of the process and improve the likelihood of accepting a job offer, and face-to-face interviews compared to video conferencing and telephone interviews. In video conferencing interviews the perception of the interviewer may be viewed as less personable, trustworthy, and competent.\n\nInterview anxiety refers to having unpleasant feelings before or during a job interview. It also reflects the fear of partaking in an interview. Job candidates may feel this increased sense of anxiety because they have little to no control over the interview process. It could also be because they have to speak with a stranger. Due to this fear, anxious candidates display certain behaviors or traits that signal to the interviewer that they are anxious. Examples of such behaviors include frequent pauses, speaking more slowly than usual, and biting or licking of lips.\n\nResearch has identified five dimensions of interview anxiety: communication anxiety, social anxiety, performance anxiety, behavioral anxiety and appearance anxiety. Further research shows that both the interviewer and applicant agree that speaking slowly is a clear sign of interview anxiety. However, they do not agree on other anxiety indicators such as frequent pauses and biting or licking of lips. Trait judgments are also related to interview anxiety and can affect interviewer perceptions of anxiety. Low assertiveness has been identified as the key trait related to interview anxiety. Thus, the most important indicators of interview anxiety are slow speech rate and low assertiveness.\n\nAnother issue in interview anxiety is gender differences. Although females report being more anxious than males in interviews, their anxiety is not as readily detected as that for males. This can be explained by the Sex-Linked Anxiety Coping Theory (SCT). This theory suggests that females cope better than males when they are anxious in interviews.\n\nWhether anxieties come from individual differences or from the interview setting, they have important costs for job candidates. These include: limiting effective communication and display of future potential, reducing interview performance and evaluation despite potential fit for the job, and reducing the chance of a second interview compared to less anxious individuals.\nSpeaking slowly and low assertiveness have the strongest negative impact on perceptions of interview anxiety. Thus, candidates who experience anxiety in interviews should try to display assertive behaviors such as being dominant, professional, optimistic, attentive and confident In addition, they should speak at a consistent pace that is not unusually slow.\n\nApplicants who view the selection process more favorably tend to be more positive about the organization, and are likely to influence an organization's reputation. whereas, in contrast, anxious or uncomfortable during their interview may view an organization less favorably, causing the otherwise qualified candidates not accepting a job offer. If an applicant is nervous, they might not act the same way they would on the job, making it harder for organizations to use the interview for predicting someone's future job performance.\n\nIn many countries laws are put into place to prevent organizations from engaging in discriminatory practices against protected classes when selecting individuals for jobs. In the United States, it is unlawful for private employers with 15 or more employees along with state and local government employers to discriminate against applicants based on the following: race, color, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or over), disability, or genetic information (note: additional classes may be protected depending on state or local law). More specifically, an employer cannot legally \"fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privilege of employment\" or \"to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.\"\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1991 (Title VII) were passed into law to prevent the discrimination of individuals due to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act was added as an amendment and protects women if they are pregnant or have a pregnancy-related condition.\n\nThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibits discriminatory practice directed against individuals who are 40 years of age and older. Although some states (e.g. New York) do have laws preventing the discrimination of individuals younger than 40, no federal law exists.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protects qualified individuals who currently have or in the past have had a physical or mental disability (current users of illegal drugs are not covered under this Act). A person is covered if he has a disability that substantially limits a major life activity, has a history of a disability, is regarded by others as being disabled, or has a physical or mental impairment that is not transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor. In order to be covered under this Act, the individual must be qualified for the job. A qualified individual is \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\" Unless the disability poses an \"undue hardship,\" reasonable accommodations must be made by the organization. \"In general, an accommodation is any change in the work environment or in the way things are customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities.\" Examples of reasonable accommodations are changing the workspace of an individual in a wheelchair to make it more wheelchair accessible, modifying work schedules, and/or modifying equipment. Employees are responsible for asking for accommodations to be made by their employer.\n\nThe most recent law to be passed is Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. In essence, this law prohibits the discrimination of employees or applicants due to an individual's genetic information and family medical history information.\n\nIn rare circumstances, it is lawful for employers to base hiring decisions on protected class information if it is considered a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification, that is, if it is a \"qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business.\" For example, a movie studio may base a hiring decision on age if the actor they are hiring will play a youthful character in a film.\n\nGiven these laws, organizations are limited in the types of questions they legally are allowed to ask applicants in a job interview. Asking these questions may cause discrimination against protected classes, unless the information is considered a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification. For example, in the majority of situations it is illegal to ask the following questions in an interview as a condition of employment:\n\nApplicants with disabilities may be concerned with the effect that their disability has on both interview and employment outcomes. Research has concentrated on four key issues: how interviewers rate applicants with disabilities, the reactions of applicants with disabilities to the interview, the effects of disclosing a disability during the interview, and the perceptions different kinds of applicant disabilities may have on interviewer ratings.\n\nThe job interview is a tool used to measure constructs or overall characteristics that are relevant for the job. Oftentimes, applicants will receive a score based on their performance during the interview. Research has found different findings based on interviewers’ perceptions of the disability. For example, some research has found a leniency effect (i.e., applicants with disabilities receive higher ratings than equally qualified non-disabled applicants) in ratings of applicants with disabilities Other research, however, has found there is a disconnect between the interview score and the hiring recommendation for applicants with disabilities. That is, even though applicants with disabilities may have received a high interview score, they are still not recommended for employment. The difference between ratings and hiring could be detrimental to a company because they may be missing an opportunity to hire a qualified applicant.\n\nA second issue in interview research deals with the applicants’ with disabilities reactions to the interview and applicant perceptions of the interviewers. Applicants with disabilities and able-bodied applicants report similar feelings of anxiety towards an interview. Applicants with disabilities often report that interviewers react nervously and insecurely, which leads such applicants to experience anxiety and tension themselves. The interview is felt to be the part of the selection process where covert discrimination against applicants with disabilities can occur. Many applicants with disabilities feel they cannot disclose (i.e., inform potential employer of disability) or discuss their disability because they want to demonstrate their abilities. If the disability is visible, then disclosure will inevitably occur when the applicant meets the interviewer, so the applicant can decide if they want to discuss their disability. If an applicant has a non-visible disability, however, then that applicant has more of a choice in disclosing and discussing. In addition, applicants who were aware that the recruiting employer already had employed people with disabilities felt they had a more positive interview experience. Applicants should consider if they are comfortable with talking about and answering questions about their disability before deciding how to approach the interview.\n\nResearch has also demonstrated that different types of disabilities have different effects on interview outcomes. Disabilities with a negative stigma and that are perceived as resulting from the actions of the person (e.g., HIV-Positive, substance abuse) result in lower interview scores than disabilities for which the causes are perceived to be out of the individual's control (e.g., physical birth defect). A physical disability often results in higher interviewer ratings than psychological (e.g., mental illness) or sensory conditions (e.g., Tourette Syndrome). In addition, there are differences between the effects of disclosing disabilities that are visible (e.g., wheelchair bound) and non-visible (e.g., Epilepsy) during the interview. When applicants had a non-visible disability and disclosed their disability early in the interview they were not rated more negatively than applicants who did not disclose. In fact, they were liked more than the applicants who did not disclose their disability and were presumed not disabled. Interviewers tend to be impressed by the honesty of the disclosure. Strong caution needs to be taken with applying results from studies about specific disabilities, as these results may not apply to other types of disabilities. Not all disabilities are the same and more research is needed to find whether these results are relevant for other types of disabilities.\n\nSome practical implications for job interviews for applicants with disabilities include research findings that show there are no differences in interviewer responses to a brief, shorter discussion or a detailed, longer discussion about the disability during the interview. Applicants, however, should note that when a non-visible disability is disclosed near the end of the interview, applicants were rated more negatively than early disclosing and non-disclosing applicants. Therefore, it is possible that interviewers feel individuals who delay disclosure may do so out of shame or embarrassment. In addition, if the disability is disclosed after being hired, employers may feel deceived by the new hire and reactions could be less positive than would have been in the interview. If applicants want to disclose their disability during the interview, research shows that a disclosure and/or discussion earlier in the interview approach may afford them some positive interview effects. The positive effects, however, are preceded by the interviewers perception of the applicants’ psychological well-being. That is, when the interviewer perceives the applicant is psychologically well and/or comfortable with his or her disability, there can be positive interviewer effects. In contrast, if the interviewer perceives the applicant as uncomfortable or anxious discussing the disability, this may either fail to garner positive effect or result in more negative interview ratings for the candidate. Caution must again be taken when applying these research findings to other types of disabilities not investigated in the studies discussed above. There are many factors that can influence the interview of an applicant with a disability, such as whether the disability is physical or psychological, visible or non-visible, or whether the applicant is perceived as responsible for the disability or not. Therefore, applicants should make their own conclusions about how to proceed in the interview after comparing their situations with those examined in the research discussed here.\n\nAlthough it is illegal for employers to ask about applicants’ arrest record during an interview as a deciding factor in applicant hiring decisions, employers do have the right to obtain information about applicants’ criminal convictions before hiring, including during the interview phase. Many companies consider hiring applicants with criminal history a liability. For instance, if a company hired someone with an assault charge and that person later assaulted another employee or vendor, some people would say that the company was liable or legally responsible for not maintaining a safe work environment. Although the legalities are more complex, this potential responsibility an organization may carry often is a reason why many companies conduct criminal background checks. When making hiring decisions that somewhat depend on one's criminal background, employers must consider the following:\n\n\nAlthough not much research has been conducted to examine whether applicants should talk about their criminal histories or not, a 2012 study found that employers were more likely to hire someone with a criminal record if the applicant made face-to-face contact with the employer and was prepared and willing to discuss his/her job related knowledge. Applicants also had an increased chance of being hired if they discussed what they learned from their experience in the justice system, as well as how they were rehabilitated, during the interview. This study found that employers preferred applicants that revealed their criminal records upfront and were willing to take responsibility for their actions.\n\nBan the Box is a campaign to remove the question about criminal history from job applications as an opportunity to give people with criminal histories a reasonable chance in the employment selection process. By allowing applicants to be interviewed before disclosing their criminal histories, this campaign seeks to increase the number of applicants with criminal histories in the workplace. The campaign focuses on how discrimination in the recruiting phase of selection makes it harder for people with criminal convictions to obtain employment. Not having employment makes it harder for people with criminal histories to support their families, and a lack of a job can lead to an increased chance of the person becoming a repeat offender.\n\nJob applicants who are underweight (to the point of emaciation), overweight or obese may face discrimination in the interview. The negative treatment of overweight and obese individuals may stem from beliefs that weight is controllable and those who fail to control their weight are lazy, unmotivated, and lack self-discipline. Underweight individuals may also be subject to appearance-related negative treatment. Underweight, overweight and obese applicants are not protected from discrimination by any current United States laws. However, some individuals who are morbidly obese and whose obesity is due to a physiological disorder may be protected against discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nDiscrimination against pregnant applicants is illegal under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, which views pregnancy as a temporary disability and requires employers to treat pregnant applicants the same as all other applicants. Yet, discrimination against pregnant applicants continues both in the United States and internationally. Research shows that pregnant applicants compared to non-pregnant applicants are less likely to be recommended for hire. Interviewers appear concerned that pregnant applicants are more likely than non-pregnant applicants to miss work and even quit. Organizations who wish to reduce potential discrimination against pregnant applicants should consider implementing structured interviews, although some theoretical work suggests interviewers may still show biases even in these types of interviews.\n\nEmployers are using social networking sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to obtain additional information about job applicants. While these sites may be useful to verify resume information, profiles with pictures also may reveal much more information about the applicant, including issues pertaining to applicant weight and pregnancy. Some employers are also asking potential job candidates for their social media logins which has alarmed many privacy watch dogs and regulators.\n\nAs with the common comparisons between Eastern and Western cultures, interviews and the constructs assessed by the interview have been found to differ across the world. For example, studies of the United States of America (USA) to Canada have found conflicting results in average levels of agreeableness in each country. People tend to use social comparison when reporting their own level of agreeableness. Even though Canadians are likely to be more agreeable, they might score similarly to those individuals from the USA. In situations where social comparison is a factor, an honest answer could result in under- or over-estimation.\n\nBecause of these cultural differences, more businesses are adding cross-cultural training to their HR training. The goal of cross-cultural training is to improve one's ability to adapt and judge people from other cultures. This training is a first step in ensuring the process of using the job interview to decide whom to hire works the same in a selection situation where there are cross-cultural factors.\n\nOne cultural difference in the job interview is in the type of questions applicants will expect and not expect to be asked. Interviewers outside the USA often ask about family, marital status and children. These types of questions are usually not allowed by USA job laws but acceptable in other countries. Applicants can be surprised by questions interviewers ask them that are not appropriate or consistent with their own cultures. For example, in Belgium and Russia interviewers are unlikely to ask about an applicant's personal values, opinions and beliefs. Thus, USA interviewers who do ask applicants about their values can make non-USA applicants uneasy or misinterpret the reason they are not prepared.\n\nAnother difference is in the consistency with which common constructs, even those that generalize across cultures, predict across different countries and cultures. For example, those who seem high in Agreeableness can do less well on the job in European workplaces. But those high in Agreeableness in the USA or Japan will do better on the job as measured on the same criteria. In some cases the structured Behavior Description Interview (BDI) that predicts who will do well on the job in some countries, from their interview scores, fails to predict accurately which applicants to hire in other countries.\n\nThere are a few ways that cross-cultural differences can mess up the results of our attempts to predict job performance. The first source of error is construct bias, the possibility that the construct being measured is viewed differently by those from another culture, if it exists at all. One way this could happen is if the behaviors a person displays, that go with that construct, are viewed differently in different cultures. It could also be the extent to which the construct even exists in their country. For example, the Multidimensional Work Ethic Profile (MWEP), is a scale demonstrated to work across many countries. However, in China the MWEP concept/dimension of Leisure has been shown to have poor equivalence with other countries, and may be a culturally inappropriate assessment due to the Confucian concept of hard work without leisure. Research has shown that differences in the levels of established cross-cultural constructs such as Cultural Tightness-Looseness increase or decrease the effect of the Five Factor Model personality traits. Tight cultures have strong social norms and adherence coupled with low tolerance for behavior that deviates from those norms, and loose cultures are the opposite with weak norms and high tolerance for deviance. An interviewer from a tight culture might view the normal behaviors of a loose cultured interviewee as signs of a poor moral character despite the behavior being normal. As such, differences between the tightness-looseness of the interviewer's and interviewee's home countries can introduce method bias, negatively affecting the interviewer's assessment of interviewee answers and behaviors. First construct bias must be measured by comparing groups of persons from distinct cultures and comparing if any real differences are discovered. Then information on those differences can be used to make the adjustments needed to allow the construct to measure what it is intended to measure in people from a different culture.\n\nResponse bias is another cross-cultural difference that has been shown to affect how we measure constructs and interpret the results. Social desirability bias is a tendency to give a socially acceptable answer, even if it is a lie, because we want to look good. Giving socially acceptable, but part or completely false, answers can inflate interview scores. One simple example of socially acceptable answers is called acquiescence bias, which is a tendency to agree with all questions with positive meaning. People also have been found to show different attitudes towards answers on the extreme high and low end of a set of options (extremely agree or extremely disagree). In some cases, people from a different cultures may just be unfamiliar with a word (term, concept, context) or with a type of question. Another research study found that self and other reports of conscientiousness failed to relate with expected job behaviors across cultures, demonstrating that one of the most predictive constructs in the USA is tied to aspects of USA culture that may not be present in a different type of culture.\n\nFor example, in the West, applicants prefer to eliminate details and focus on the larger issue, tending towards a comprehensive evaluation starting from individual elements then moving towards the whole. In Japan, a respondent would go from the general to the specific in answering, preferring to divide a problem and analyze it piece by piece. Likewise, there are differences between individualist and collectivist cultures in the types of answers they chose. When given a series of options, individualists tend to choose the task oriented option that involves direct communication with others. Yet collectivists choose the option that sees group harmony and protecting or saving face for others as more important. These differences can introduce method bias when interviewers evaluate or score how the applicant did in the interview. This is why it is important to understand how and why the best answer in one culture is not the best elsewhere. It might even be completely wrong.\n\nThere is also item bias introduced by the actual items or questions in an interview. Poor item translation can be a problem. This might be incorrectly translating the same item to another language such as in an organization that hires both English and Spanish speaking employees. Or it might be in someone not understanding the wording of an item because they are not native to that country's language. Similar to construct bias, the wording of an item can result in measuring different traits because of different meanings in the two different cultures.\n\n\n"}
