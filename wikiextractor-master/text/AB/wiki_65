{"id": "1997798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997798", "title": "Acámbaro", "text": "Acámbaro\n\nAcámbaro is a city and municipality in the southeastern corner of the Mexican state of Guanajuato, on the banks of the Lerma River, and the oldest of the 46 municipalities of Guanajuato. Acámbaro was originally a Purépecha settlement which was invaded by the Spanish, and their Otomi allies, in 1526. Acámbaro is noted as a major railway junction, a local transport hub, and the origin of the nationally famous Acámbaro bread. The current (2005 census) population of the municipality is 101,762 persons, that of the city proper 55,082. The municipality covers an area of 867.67 km² (335.01 sq mi) and includes many small outlying communities, the largest of which are Iramuco and Parácuaro.\n\nThe municipality of Acámbaro is bordered to the north by Tarimoro and Jerécuaro, to the southeast by Tarandacuao, to the south by the state of Michoacán, and to the west by Salvatierra.\n\nThe name Acámbaro is derived from a Native American term meaning \"place of magueyes\". The first inhabitants of this area belonged to the Chupicuaro culture, one of the oldest in Mesoamerica. Their origin is estimated to be from 1200 B.C. In this region there have been valuable archaeological finds of ceramic that are now exhibited at the local museum. \n\nThe city was founded on September 19, 1526, by the cacique Don Nicolás de San Luis Montañés, with the name \"San Francisco de Acámbaro\". It was the first Spanish town in what is now the state of Guanajuato. The evangelization process was undertaken by Franciscan friars, who also constructed splendid structures that remain standing today, such as the \"Templo del Hospital\" (Hospital Temple), an aqueduct in the Mudéjar style (1527), and a stone bridge over the River Lerma (1750). The first bullfights on the soil of New Spain were held in Acámbaro, and the \"Fuente Taurina\" fountain in the city's plaza commemorates the introduction of the sport to Mexico. Acámbaro is the only city in Mexico that has a fully intact colonial-era aqueduct.\n\nThe 18th century brought prosperity to Acámbaro. In that time important religious and public buildings were constructed. Several temples, bridges, and houses were left as remnants of the city's colonial architecture. \n\nAn important event in the history of Mexican independence took place in Acámbaro. Don Miguel Hidalgo stayed there on October 22, 1810, and brought a ceremony that declared Acámbaro military quarters for the \"Ejército Grande de América\" (Grand Army of America). Hidalgo was given the title of \"Generalísimo de las Américas\" (Grand General of the Americas). That same day, a parade of eighty thousand insurgents took place, that demonstrated the speed of growth of the movement: one month prior on September 16 just 800 men responded to the \"Grito de Dolores\" and raised arms against the Spanish in Dolores Hidalgo.\n\nBecause of its strategic location, Acámbaro was the key to the development of the railway in Mexico, and had a major junction, yard and shop facility for the National Railways of Mexico (The rail lines are now owned by Kansas City Southern de Mexico). Acámbaro was the home of the only full scale locomotive repair facility in Latin America that was capable of constructing steam locomotives. During 1944 Acámbaro's mechanical workshop built \"La Fidelita 296\", a steam engine that is a symbol of a time in history of the \"Acambarense\" society. \"La Fidelita\" is now on display as the cornerstone exhibit of Acámbaro's railway museum. Another souvenir of Acámbaro's age of steam is a large model locomotive that sits on an elevated platform in the center of a major highway intersection east of the city. The model engine was originally intended to be placed in a church as a thanks by railway workers to the \"Virgen del Refugio\" (patron saint of the city) for bringing prosperity and jobs to Acámbaro, however, the model would not fit through the doorway of the church. Consequently, it was decided to mount the model outdoors.\n\nAcámbaro has been notable as a point of controversy in the field of archeology as the source of the Acámbaro figures, a collection of about 32,000 clay figurines discovered by German archaeologist Waldemar Julsrud in 1944 near the city's most prominent landmark, the \"Cerro del Toro\" (Bull Hill). The figures are claimed to be hoaxes, as some of the figurines resembled dinosaurs (thus implying that man and dinosaurs co-existed) and their discovery is used by some as evidence to support creationism. Many of the Julsrud finds are now on display at the \"Museo Waldemar Julsrud\".\n\nLess controversial archeological artifacts are on display at the \"Museo de Chupícuaro\" (also known as \"Museo Fray Bernardo Padilla\"), documenting the history of the Chupícuaro people, and the \"Museo Local de Acámbaro\", which has over 4000 relics relating to local Mesoamerican cultures. The \"Museo Local\" also contains paintings related to colonial Mexico and the war of independence.\n\n\"Pan de Acámbaro\" (Acambaro bread), Acámbaro's most famous culinary export, is a bakery product similar to Jewish Challah (It is supposed that the similarity is not coincidental). The largest of the six city bakeries devoted to the production of \"Pan de Acámbaro\" is \"Tio Sams\" (Uncle Sam's), which claims credit for its invention.

When the Pacific Coast was explored, he had served as a midshipman with Captain Vancouver in 1791. He served in European waters from 1801 to 1811. He was mentioned in dispatches for his gallant conduct in a fight with a French squadron when, as First Lieutenant of \"Bourdelais\", \"though dangerously wounded, he had disdained to quit the deck\". Barrie then commanded a number of ships during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. In 1804 he had been promoted Captain commanded \"Brilliant\" at 24-guns and in 1806 he went to \"Pomone\" at 38-guns. On 5 June 1807, he attacked a convoy of seventeen ships, sank three men-of-war, and captured fourteen other warships and store ships. He captured a privateer commanded by De Boissi, the Adjutant-General of France. In 1809, he captured a French warship and five transports. In 1811 he captured a Corsican fort and three French men-of-war. In 1811, he captured several important French prisoners, including Napoleon's brother Lucien Bonaparte on a French ship. He was particularly active during the War of 1812, carrying out several successful attacks on American towns and shipping in the Penobscot River region, and helping to destroy the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla. From 1813 to 1815 he served in the \"Dragon\" in American waters, and here again he made many captures. In 1813 Barrie collected runaway slaves from the Maryland and Virginia shores. After a brief period spent living in France Barrie took up the post of Acting Commissioner of the Quebec Dockyard 1817-1818.\n\nBy 1819, he served as Commissioner of the dockyard at Kingston. He was active in a number of areas, building and expanding the dockyard and promoting important hydrographic surveys and the construction of canals. Between 1819 and 1820 Captain Barrie, as Flag Officer of the Great Lakes, built the Stone Frigate in Kingston Royal Navy Dockyard to house the gear of the warships of 1812 laid up in Navy Bay. His instructions were to expedite the repair of the vessels at the bases in case of any emergency. From December 1820, the command of Flag Officer of the Great Lakes disappeared from the Navy List. In March 1824 Barrie was listed as \"Acting Resident Commissioner, Kingston, Upper Canada\" and his headquarters was shown to have been transferred to Kingston.\n\nHe cultivated friendships with several important political figures, and on his return to England in 1834 received a number of honours.\n\nBarrie was born at St. Augustine, Florida on 5 May 1774, the son of Scottish surgeon Dr Robert Barrie of Sanquhar and his wife, Dorothea (Dolly) Gardner, the sister of Sir Alan Gardner. His mother returned to England on the death of her husband in 1775, and settled in Preston, Lancashire. In 1784 she remarried George Clayton, a textile manufacturer, while her son was schooled at Neston, Cheshire, and later at Dedham. Between 1784 and 1788, he was carried on the books of HMS \"Europa\" as a servant to the captain (his uncle, Alan Gardner) but most likely his first shipboard service was as a junior midshipman on HMS \"Goliath\".\n\nGardner arranged for Barrie to serve as a midshipman aboard from December 1790 until 1795, during George Vancouver's voyage of diplomacy and exploration along the Pacific coast of North America. Many of his letters home survive, describing his experiences of adventure, punctuated by periods of boredom after he exhausted the books on the ships. Barrie gained an acting promotion to Lieutenant on the expedition, and commanded a survey party on the northern coast of what is now British Columbia. He was formally promoted to Lieutenant upon the return to England in October 1795. In 1800 Barrie served in the West Indies under Thomas Manby, who had also taken part in the Vancouver expedition. On 23 October 1801 Barrie received a promotion to commander, and seven months later was advanced to post-captain while commanding the 16-gun sloop \"Calypso\".\n\nBarrie took command of the frigate in June 1806, serving initially off the French coast and then in the Mediterranean. He captured two significant Frenchmen during this period, the adjutant general of France, Chevalier Charles de Boissi, in June 1809, and Napoleon's brother Lucien Bonaparte, in October 1810, while Lucien was attempting to escape to America from Italy.\n\nOn 1 May 1811 with two other ships, he entered the Gulf of Sagone, Corsica, sank three ships and destroyed its fortifications. He was then ordered to bring the British ambassador to Persia back to England, but \"Pomone\" was sunk while approaching Portsmouth. The subsequent court-martialled for the loss of the ship acquitted Barrie of misconduct but did censure the pilot.\n\nBarrie took command of the 74-gun third-rate in October 1812, and sailed to America during the War of 1812. He participated in the blockade of Chesapeake Bay. He served as the commodore of the squadron for several months, and captured over 85 vessels. His squadron blockaded the Patuxent River between June and August. In September 1814 he joined Sir John Coape Sherbrooke's forces for the attack on the Penobscot River region in the American state of Maine (then part of Massachusetts). Barrie commanded a joint expedition that defeated American militia in the Battle of Hampden, capturing and looting the towns of Hampden and Bangor and destroying the frigate . Barrie's rough treatment of the captured towns in central Maine earned the British lasting resentment in that region.\n\nForces under Barrie went on to destroy the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla.\n\nIn November 1813, ten of Whittington's slaves escaped to the British frigate \"Dragon\" under Commodore John Barrie. The ship had dropped anchor off St. George's Island near the Maryland shore of the Potomac River, but it was also visible from the Virginia shore. The ten slaves were George, age twenty-five; Jane, age thirty-three; Leviticus, age sixteen; Willouby, age thirteen; Levincy, age ten; John, age ten; Eliza, age seven; Louisa, age five; and Ezekiel and Isaiah, both six months old. A large number of Maryland slaves had already escaped from the farms of St. Mary's County residents, including Mathias Clarke, George Loker, and Dr. Hezekiah Dent (see Peter U. Thomson), all of whom lived near St. George's Island.\n\nBarrie went onto half pay after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. He married Julia Wharton Ingilby on 24 October 1816 and went to live in France. He returned to service in January 1819, with the post of commissioner of the dockyard at Kingston, Upper Canada. The post made him senior naval officer in the Canadas, with control over the inland waterways and the port at Quebec. His instructions were to expedite the repair of the vessels at the bases in case of any emergency. He settled at Point Frederick, Kingston and among his achievements was the construction of a three-storey stone warehouse between 1819 and 1820. The building held the equipment of the ships reduced to the reserve under the Rush–Bagot Agreement of 1817. It was used briefly as a barracks, and then refitted to become part of the Royal Military College of Canada by 1876. It still survives, and is known as the HMCS Stone Frigate.\n\nFrom December 1820, the command of Flag Officer of the Great Lakes disappeared from the Navy List. In March 1824 Barrie was listed as \"Acting Resident Commissioner, Kingston, Upper Canada\" and his headquarters was shown to have been transferred to Kingston. Barrie exerted himself in a number of maritime-related matters, including the International Boundary Commission. He promoted a hydrographic survey of the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, the building of the Rideau and Welland canals, and relations with the United States. He became particular friends with a number of politicians, including Governors Lord Dalhousie and his successor Lord Aylmer, and Sir Peregrine Maitland and his wife Lady Sarah. During his later in Canada Barrie considered the possibility of a seat on the executive councils of the Canadas, but received an unpromising response from Sir George Cockburn.\n\nBarrie returned to England in 1825 and was consulted by the Admiralty on the naval establishments and defences of the Canadas. He was subsequently promoted to commodore first class and returned to Kingston in 1827. In August 1827, the \"Cockburn\", was commissioned as the first of the Rush-Bagot treaty gun-boats. In 1831, he was ordered by the Admiralty to sell off the old warships of 1812 and to prepare to close down the dockyard fit. He remained there until June 1834, when the inland naval establishment was abolished. In 1834, he was ordered to strike his broad pennant and pay off the \"Cockburn.\" After the \"St. Lawrence\" was sold, for $9925, the other old warships remained as hulks in the Navy Bay or \"in frame\" on the stocks on Point Frederick. The naval stores were sold, or sent down to Quebec for carriage to England. Barrie, a popular figure in Kingston, left for England.\n\nHe was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order and was knighted by King William IV. Barrie was promoted to rear-admiral in 1837, and in 1840 was further honoured by being created a Knight Commander of the Bath. Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Barrie died on 7 June 1841 at his seat in Swarthdale.\n\nBarrie's time as commissioner in Canada was commemorated in a number of place-names, foremost of these being the city of Barrie, Ontario. Others include Barrie Creek in British Columbia, Barrie Point in British Columbia, Barrie Reach in British Columbia, the village of Barriefield in Ontario, and Barrie Island in Lake Huron.\n\n"}

{"id": "1997830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997830", "title": "Netley Castle", "text": "Netley Castle\n\nNetley Castle is a former artillery fort constructed in either 1542 or 1544 by Henry VIII in the village of Netley, Hampshire. It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and it defended Southampton Water near the Solent. The castle included a central, stone keep with two flanking gun platforms and was garrisoned by ten men. It was decommissioned during the English Civil War and by 1743 it was overgrown and in ruins. In the 19th century the property was gradually converted into a private house, being extended in a Gothic style, complete with octagonal towers. Between 1939 and 1998 it was used as a nursing home, until the high costs of maintenance led to its closure. Following an archaeological survey, it was then converted into nine residential flats. It is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building.\n\nNetley Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.\nIn 1533, Henry then broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a \"device\", in 1539, giving instructions for the \"defence of the realm in time of invasion\" and the construction of forts along the English coastline.\n\nNetley Castle was built next to Southampton Water between the mouths of the Hamble and Itchen rivers, south-west of the remains of Netley Abbey. Netley Abbey had been recently dissolved by Henry, and material from the site was reused to build the castle. William Paulet, later the Marquess of Winchester, was in charge of the construction, which took place in either 1542 or 1544 and Henry granted him various estates to pay for the support of the fort and its garrison. The castle took the form of a central keep, across with deep embrasures along the battlements, and a gun platform on either side; its design resembled that at nearby Southsea. It was initially garrisoned with two soldiers, six gunners and a porter, under the command of a captain.\n\nIt was still garrisoned in the mid-1620s and was probably still in active service at the start of the English Civil War between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament in 1642. Captain Swaley, a Parliamentary naval commander, seized Netley at the end of that year and decommissioned it as a fortification. During the Interregnum, the castle was restored to use, due to concerns about a potential Royalist invasion, but was abandoned as obsolete after the restoration of Charles II to the throne. By the time that Alexander Pope visited in 1734, the castle was overgrown and in ruins.\n\nWilliam Chamberlayne inherited the castle in 1826 and built a crenellated tower on the south-east end of the property the following year, inspired by a proposal by the antiquarian Horace Walpole that the castle be made habitable. A description of the castle around this time suggested it stood \"in the midst of a thicket of trees, on a little hill close to the beach\" and formed \"a striking object seen from the water\". It became popular with artists, and J. M. W. Turner visited and sketched the castle and its new tower, probably in 1832.\n\nGeorge Hunt leased the castle in 1841 and it was turned into a private house under the supervision of the architect George Guillame. Hunt remained at Netley until 1857, by when the castle had an oriel window overlooking the sea, and the battlements had been blocked in to allow the construction of a second storey to the building. George Sherriff leased the castle between 1868 and 1873, building a stone wall around the front of property.\n\nSir Henry Crichton bought the castle in 1881, along with the surrounding gardens, orchards, pond and a boat house. The architect John Sedding remodelled the castle between approximately 1885 and 1890, creating a Gothic styled house, adding another storey and a new wing. After Crichton's death in 1922 his wife remained in the house until her death in 1936, when the property and the surrounding grounds were sold at auction.\n\nMiddlesex County Council bought the castle in 1939 and converted it into a nursing home for elderly men; it passed into the control of the National Health Service in 1948 and continued to be used as a nursing home. It proved expensive to maintain and the surrounding land was gradually sold off, until the Southampton University Hospital NHS Trust finally decided to close it in 1998.\n\nFairmist Limited, a firm of property developers, purchased Netley Castle in 2000 and converted it into nine private residential flats, at a cost of £1.7 million, during which process an archaeological survey was made of the property. It is protected under UK law as a Scheduled Monument and a Grade II* listed building.\n\nThe castle is now approximately across and tall, surrounded by of land. The castle comprises three wings, with the original 16th-century fort incorporated into the centre of the property. The north wing is three storeys tall, decorated in a restrained Gothic style and has an octagonal turret on one corner. The central range is two storeys tall, with round corner turrets and battlements. The southern wing is two storeys in height, with elaborate Gothic detailing and another, larger octagonal tower. The castle features a substantial staircase, fitted with a musical organ, and a wood-panelled billiard room. Other buildings around the main castle include the converted boat house and a former ice house.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1997832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997832", "title": "Grant Hart", "text": "Grant Hart\n\nGrant Vernon Hart (March 18, 1961 – September 13, 2017) was an American musician, best known as the drummer and co-songwriter for the alternative rock and hardcore punk band Hüsker Dü. After the band's breakup in 1988, he released his first solo album \"Intolerance\" before forming the alternative rock trio Nova Mob, where he moved to vocals and guitar. His solo career became his main focus after the dissolution of Nova Mob in 1997.\n\nAs the co-songwriter of Hüsker Dü, Hart's songs (such as \"The Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill\" and \"Turn on the News\") received praise from critics and contemporaries. His vocal style, in contrast to that of Hüsker Dü bandmate Bob Mould, had a more measured and melodic delivery. His choice of lyrical themes, which ranged from teenage alienation in \"Standing by the Sea\" and the depiction of a murder in \"Diane,\" to playful story-telling in \"Books About UFOs,\" helped to expand the subject matter of hardcore punk.\n\nHart died on September 13, 2017 of complications from liver cancer and Hepatitis C.\n\nGrant Hart was born in South St. Paul, Minnesota, the youngest child of a credit union employee and a shop teacher. Hart described his family as a \"typical American dysfunctional family [...] Not very abusive, though. Nothing really to complain about.\" When Hart was 10, his older brother was killed by a drunk driver. Hart inherited his brother's drum set and records; he soon began playing in a number of makeshift bands as a teenager. \n\nHart met Bob Mould while working at a record store. Mould, then a college freshman, would buy marijuana from Hart. At first Hart dismissed Mould as \"an upstater pretending to be a Manhattanite,\" but the two soon became friends.\n\nHart formed Hüsker Dü in 1979 with Bob Mould and his friend Greg Norton. The band's early material had them lumped in with the hardcore movement of the early 1980s. The band members received help from their parents in their early days. In Hart's case, his mother let him use the copier machine at the credit union where she worked to make show flyers, and the band added $2,000 to an existing loan at the credit union to release the band's first single, \"Statues,\" on their own label Reflex Records in 1981. Success existed on a small scale for the band; by 1982 Hart was unemployed and relied on support from friends and family.\n\nHüsker Dü's music became more accomplished and melodic over time. By late 1982, Hart's drumming \"rushed the music along more precisely than ever\" and he and Mould, who traded vocal duties, were singing more tunefully. While Mould was the band's primary songwriter, Hart began writing more songs. Hart wrote two songs for 1983's \"Metal Circus\" EP, the \"perversely sing-along\" \"Diane\" and the \"impassioned speed-pop gem\" \"It's Not Funny Anymore.\" Hüsker Dü's more melodic take on hardcore struck a chord with college students, and various tracks from \"Metal Circus\", particularly Hart's \"Diane,\" were put into rotation by dozens of campus radio stations across the US. Hart was tagged by observers as the \"hippie\" of the group due to his long hair and his propensity to drum with bare feet; biographer Michael Azerrad additionally noted that \"the wide-eyed sincerity of his songs was far more San Francisco '67 than New York City '77,\" which contrasted with Mould's \"incisively bitter\" songs.\nAs Hart and Mould developed as musicians and songwriters, an unspoken tension and competition arose in the band between them. Tensions were heightened when Mould demanded that starting with 1984's \"Zen Arcade\" that the band's records contain individual songwriter credits. In spite of the creative tensions, Hüsker Dü garnered critical acclaim with the release of \"Zen Arcade\" and subsequent albums. Michael Azerrad stated that by 1985's \"Flip Your Wig\" \"the two songwriters were trying their level best to outdo each other, and with spectacular results\" Hüsker Dü had left the hardcore genre behind, which caused some discomfort with their label at the time, SST Records. In one interview, Hart hinted that SST thought Hüsker Dü were \"soft\" because they stayed in motels while touring and occasionally wrote happy songs. Hart elaborated, \"We don't have to convince the world that we're suffering to convince them that we're artists... There's nothing wrong with being happy.\"\nHart designed most of Hüsker Dü's album covers.\n\nIn 1986 Hüsker Dü became one of the first key bands from the American indie scene to sign with a major label, inking a deal with Warner Bros. Records. However, tensions within the band worsened after signing with Warner Bros. Hart became addicted to heroin following the band's tour behind their major label debut \"Candy Apple Grey\" in 1986, with Hart also being incorrectly diagnosed as HIV-positive in the middle of that year. Mould and Hart were feuding openly about Hart's drug use and creative conflicts, with Hart accusing Mould of ensuring he could not have more than 45 percent of the songs on each of the band's albums.\n\nThe band dissolved after a show in Columbia, Missouri, in 1987. Hart was trying to quit heroin using a supply of methadone, but the bottle had leaked. Hart played the show, but Mould and Norton were concerned Hart would soon be suffering from withdrawal and thus would be unable to play the next few shows. While Hart insisted he could perform, Mould had already canceled the dates. Hart quit the band four days later. Hart has said his drug use was not the reason for the band's demise; rather, it was the tensions between the band members. Hart said, \"It just became that it was easier to be around Bob if you were playing a part of Bob's game,\" and also said he felt Mould's songs had become increasingly \"square.\"\nThough it was often rumored during his Hüsker Dü days that he and bandmate Mould were in a relationship (Hart was openly bisexual, Mould is openly gay, and both acknowledge taking partners on tour), both have flatly denied ever having been romantically involved.\nSix months after Hüsker Dü's breakup, Hart discovered that his diagnosis as being HIV-positive was incorrect. In 1988 he released the solo EP, \"2541\", on Hüsker Dü's former label SST. The title is taken from the address of his former band's office and rehearsal house, where the members had at one time lived. Marshall Crenshaw would later cover the title song, as would the Go-Betweens' Robert Forster. After the release of the EP, Hart went further into sobriety, recording and releasing the album \"Intolerance\" and the associated EP \"All of My Senses\" in 1989 and 1990, respectively.\n\nIn late 1989, he formed a new band, Nova Mob, with Michael Crego on drums, Tom Merkl on bass, and Hart himself taking guitar duties. The band took their name from the novel \"Nova Express\" by William Burroughs; it had previously been used by an unrecorded group featuring the young Julian Cope and Pete Wylie. The band released their first EP \"Admiral of the Sea\" and album \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" in 1991. The lineup later changed with Marc Retish and then Steve Sutherland on drums, and Chris Hesler on lead guitar. The band routinely toured Europe to warm reception. Nova Mob released their second album \"Nova Mob\" in 1994 and disbanded after a supporting tour.\n\nHart returned to recording as a solo artist with the release of the live album \"Ecce Homo\" in 1995 and \"Good News for Modern Man\" in late 1999. On 21 October 2004, Hart and Mould reunited at the benefit concert for Karl Mueller (bassist for fellow Minneapolis stalwarts Soul Asylum), who was then fighting what would turn out to be a losing battle with cancer.\n\nHart recorded his next solo album (and first in a decade), \"Hot Wax\", in Montreal and Minneapolis. Hart told Britain's \"Q\" in September 2006, \"I'm working on some stuff with the Godspeed You! Black Emperor people. They've given more of themselves in a few weeks than Bob did in nine years with Hüsker Dü.\" In 2008, Hart was one of the guest singers on \"Lotuk\", the third album of Arsenal, a Belgian band combining roots and dance music. In the summer of 2008, Hart debuted a new track, \"Schoolbuses Are For Children,\" on his Myspace site. He released \"Hot Wax\" on October 6, 2009. \"Intolerance\" was reissued on February 9, 2010, on 180-gram vinyl, and \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" was reissued with extra tracks and new mastering on December 7, 2010.\n\nIn December 2012, Hart embarked on a short tour of Ireland with a new lineup, Colm O' Herlihy on guitar, Dan Walsh on drums and Simon Dargan on bass In a recent Facebook Q&A, Hart commented \"I love playing with these guys. They let me make music rather than getting bogged down administrating a band's business. They make it a joy with their self-starting ways\" He confirmed this lineup for his upcoming European and USA dates. Most recently, Hart released the double album \"The Argument\" (based on John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\") in the summer of 2013.\n\nIn October 2013, documentary filmmaker Gorman Bechard (\"Color Me Obsessed\", about The Replacements) released \"\", a film about Hart which chronicles the musician's life from birth to the recording of \"The Argument\". Told in the style of the Errol Morris film \"The Fog of War\", Hart is the only interview subject in the film.\n\nHart has been honored with two stars on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, one for his solo work and one for Hüsker Dü. The stars recognize performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.\n\nIn tribute to Grant Hart and his work with Hüsker Dü, The Posies recorded a song entitled \"Grant Hart\" which was released on their 1996 album \"Amazing Disgrace\".\n\nGrant Hart married Brigid McGough Hart on July 5, 2017, at Church of the Assumption in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nHart died on September 13, 2017, at 9:02 p.m., at Fairview University of Minnesota Hospital of complications from liver cancer and Hepatitis C. He was 56 years old. He is survived by his wife Brigid McGough Hart and son Karl Turbenson.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a Uyghur political leader in East Turkistan. Ehmetjan was born in Ghulja in 1914. He studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, Moscow in 1936 and was a member of Communist Party of Soviet Union. Ehmetjan was described as \"Stalin's man\" and as a \"communist-minded progressive\". Qasim Russified his surname to \"Kasimov\" and became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nEhmetjan was born in Ghulja (Yining in Chinese) in 1914. He studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, Moscow in 1936 and was a member of Communist Party of Soviet Union. Ehmetjan was described as \"Stalin's man\" and as a \"communist-minded progressive\". Qasim Russified his surname to \"Kasimov\" and became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe was a member of the governing council of the Second East Turkestan Republic, a Soviet-backed administration founded in three northwestern districts of Xinjiang during the Ili Rebellion in November 1944. Qasimi himself was not involved with the planning of the rebellion. The Second ETR was initially led by Elihan Tore, who favored forming a conservative Islamic government. Tore was placed under house arrest in the Soviet Union in 1946, under the orders of Stalin. Qasimi was a leader of the pro-Soviet East Turkistan Turkic People's National Liberation Committee (ETTPNLC). \n\nIn June 1946, Qasimi tried to reach a political agreement with the Nationalist Chinese leader Zhang Zhizhong to form a coalition provincial government in Dihua (present day Urumqi). The Second ETR was to be disbanded in name but the three districts retained autonomy. As a president of the ETR, Qasimi called for unity and support for his government and rejected the coalition provincial government. He explained that the people of East Turkistan had risen in rebellion only to secure their rights under the Chinese constitution. He led a delegation to the Chinese National Assembly Nanjing to negotiate bi-lateral relations between ETR and the Republic of China.\n\nIn the summer of 1949, as Chinese Nationalists were losing the civil war to the Chinese Communists, the Soviet Union planned for ETR leaders to switch sides. On August 22, 1949, Vasiliy Borisov, the Soviet Vice-Consul at Yining, accompanied ETR leadership in auto trip to USSR for urgent talks with Soviet officials about future of ETR, where they were told to cooperate with Communist Party of China. They were invited by Chinese Communist leader, Mao Zedong to attend the First Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing to prepare for the founding of the People's Republic of China. On August 24, 1949 Ehmetjan, Abdulkerim Abbas, Ishaq Beg Munonov, Dalelkhan Sugirbayev, Luo Zhi and other top ETR representatives (11 men in all) boarded a plane in Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh SSR, for Beijing. On September 3, the Soviet Union informed Saifuddin Azizi, another leader of the ETR, who was not on the flight that the plane had crashed near Lake Baikal en route to Beijing, killing all on board. \n\nSaifuddin and two other ETR leaders then traveled to Beijing by train where they agreed to incorporate East Turkistan into the newly founded People's Republic of China and accept important positions within the administration. News of plane crash and death of Ehmetjan was not publicly announced in Xinjiang until early December, after the People's Liberation Army had secured the region. The ETR was officially dissolved on December 20, 1949.\n\nEhmetjan Qasimi was married in January 1945 to Mahinur Qasim (Maynor Kasim; 玛依努尔•哈斯木), a native of Korgas County in Ili. The couple had a son and a daughter. In 1952, Mahinur Qasim became the mayor of Yining and joined the Chinese Communist Party. She later served as a member of Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and a vice chair of the All-China Women's Federation. She has been a prominent advocate of women and children's rights. Her memoir of her husband, \"Remembering Ehmetijan\", was published in China in 2011.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, Ehmetjan Qasimi is remembered as a fighter in the struggle against the Nationalist regime. Among the Uyghurs and other Turkic inhabitants of East Turkistan he is remembered as a national hero, and fighter who gave his life defending the independence of East Turkistan. His remains were returned to China in April 1950 and later reburied in a memorial cemetery in Yining. The cemetery has a stele with calligraphy by Mao Zedong, praising Qasimi and the others who died with him for their contributions to the Chinese civil war and mourning their death en route to the Inaugural Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing.\n\n\n"}

In later life, Sunlight enjoyed to \"dine out\" on tales of his family's adventures and brushes with the Tsarist authorities but it is suspected that these were largely fanciful. The family emigrated to England in 1890 to avoid conscription and settled in Manchester, probably choosing their new name from Port Sunlight.\n\nSunlight was apprenticed to an architect in Manchester in 1904 and by 1907 had his own practice in St Ann's Square.

{"id": "1997867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997867", "title": "Lionel Monckton", "text": "Lionel Monckton\n\nLionel John Alexander Monckton (18 December 1861 – 15 February 1924) was an English writer and composer of musical theatre. He became Britain's most popular composer of Edwardian musical comedy in the early years of the 20th century.\n\nMonckton was born in London, the eldest son of the Town Clerk of London, Sir John Braddick Monckton, and Lady Monckton, the former Maria Louisa Long (1837–1920), an \"enthusiastic amateur actress\". His sister was Mrs Augusta Moore, who wrote popular novels as Martin J. Pritchard.\nHe was educated at Charterhouse School and Oriel College at Oxford University, graduating in 1885. There he acted in college theatrical productions and composed music for productions of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, of which he was a founder, and the Phil-Thespian Club. He initially joined the legal profession at Lincoln's Inn and began to practise law, but gained part-time work as a songwriter and a theatre and music critic, first for the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" and later for the \"Daily Telegraph\". His first theatre work was \"Mummies and Marriage\", an operetta produced by amateurs in 1888. At the age of 29, in 1891, he finally managed to place the song \"What will you have to Drink?\", with lyrics by Basil Hood, in a professional musical burlesque called \"Cinder Ellen up too Late\". After this, his songs were included in several other London shows.\n\nMonckton soon became a regular composer (and sometimes lyricist) of songs for the very successful series of frothy musical comedies performed at London's Gaiety Theatre, under the management of George Edwardes, which premiered throughout the 1890s and into the first decade of the 20th Century. Among others, he wrote half of the music for Arthur Roberts's burlesque \"Claude Du-Val\" (1894) and supplemented Ivan Caryll's score for the hit musical \"The Shop Girl\" in the same year, with such successful pieces as George Grossmith, Jr.'s \"Beautiful Bountiful Bertie\" and \"Brown of Colorado\" (with Adrian Ross). He then added popular tunes to Caryll's scores for \"The Circus Girl\" in 1896 (\"A Little Bit of String\" and \"The Way to Treat a Lady\") and \"A Runaway Girl\" in 1898 (\"Soldiers in the Park\", \"Society\", \"The Sly Cigarette\", \"The Boy Guessed Right\" and \"Not the Sort of Girl I Care About\").\nThe \"Girl\" musicals were followed by a number of \"Boy\" musicals, again with hit songs by Monckton, including \"The Messenger Boy\" in 1900 (\"Maisie\", \"In the Wash\", and \"When the Boys Come Home Once More\") and \"The Toreador\" in 1901 (\"Captivating Cora\", \"I'm Romantic\", \"When I Marry Amelia\", \"Keep Off the Grass\", and \"Archie\"). Monckton's songs continued to be performed long after the shows closed – some of them remaining popular into the 1960s. In 1902, he married Gertie Millar, one of the most successful actresses of the period, whom he had discovered and brought to Edwardes. She starred in many of Monckton's shows, and he wrote some of his most popular songs for her, although their marriage was not a happy one for many years. She later sought a divorce from Monckton, which he refused.\n\nAt the same time, Monckton also contributed songs for the musicals playing at Edwardes's Daly's Theatre, which tended more towards romantic comedies, than the light musicals presented at the Gaiety. For Daly's Theatre, he usually collaborated with Sidney Jones, supplying numbers for hits such as \"The Geisha\" in 1896 (\"Jack's the Boy\" and \"The Toy Monkey\"); \"A Greek Slave\" in 1898 (\"I Want to Be Popular\", \"I Should Rather Like to Try\", and \"What Will Be the End of It?\"); and \"San Toy\" in 1899 (\"Rhoda and Her Pagoda\", and \"Sons of the Motherland\"). Monckton's music was generally arranged and orchestrated by theatre conductor Carl Kiefert.\n\nFinally, in 1902, when Jones left Daly's, Edwardes gave Monckton the opportunity to compose his first complete score, \"A Country Girl\", with a few numbers by Paul Rubens (Monckton's key songs were \"Molly the Marchioness\", \"Try Again, Johnny\", and \"Under the Deodar\"). He also continued to contribute successful songs to other musicals, including \"The Orchid\" in 1903 at the Gaiety (\"Liza Ann\", \"Little Mary\", \"Pushful\", and \"Fancy Dress\"). The success of \"A Country Girl\" led to another musical with Monckton as principal composer and Rubens as contributor, \"The Cingalee\" in 1904. Monckton's most successful songs in this score included \"The Island of Gay Ceylon\" and \"Pearl of Sweet Ceylon\". Although the piece was successful, French operettas then became the fashion at Daly's Theatre, and Monckton went back to composing music for others' shows.\n\nFurther collaborations with Caryll at the Gaiety included \"The Spring Chicken\" in 1905 (\"I Don't Know, But I Guess\", \"Alice Sat By the Fire\", and \"Under and Over Forty\"), \"The New Aladdin\", in 1906 and \"The Girls of Gottenberg\" in 1907 (\"Two Little Sausages\", \"Rheingold\", and \"Berlin on the Spree\"). These songs were among the most widely played and sung numbers of the contemporary light musical theatre. A last success at the Gaiety was Monckton and Caryll's \"Our Miss Gibbs\" in 1909 (\"Moonstruck\", \"Mary\", \"In Yorkshire\", \"Soldiers in the Park\", \"Maisie\", \"Keep off the Grass\" and \"Our Farm\"), which became an international hit.\n\nAfter that, Monckton had his greatest success, in collaboration with Howard Talbot and the lyricist Arthur Wimperis, with \"The Arcadians\", in 1909. \"The Arcadians\", produced by Robert Courtneidge, was possibly Monckton's best score and is considered the classic musical of the Edwardian period. Like \"The Geisha\", \"A Country Girl\" and \"Our Miss Gibbs\", it became popular in America and elsewhere and included songs such as \"The Pipes of Pan\", \"The Girl with the Brogue\", and \"All Down Piccadilly\", which \"held their own with the melodies of the now fashionable Viennese operetta as the song hits of the period.\"\nEdwardes purchased the lease of the Adelphi Theatre and began his productions there with another Monckton and Millar hit, \"The Quaker Girl\", in 1910 (\"The Quaker Girl\", \"Come to the Ball\", and \"Tony from America\"). For Courtneidge, he wrote \"The Mousmé\" in 1911 (\"I Know Nothing of Life\", \"The Little Japanese Mamma\", \"The Temple Bell\", and \"The Corner of My Eye\") and for Edwardes and the Adelphi, he wrote \"The Dancing Mistress\" in 1912. The latter two pieces had merely respectable runs. Monckton's last big hit was \"The Boy\" in 1917 (produced after Edwardes's death), in collaboration with Howard Talbot. This was a musical comedy version of Arthur Wing Pinero's 1885 play, \"The Magistrate\", and served as a vehicle for the comedian W. H. Berry, who had been the star of \"High Jinks\". Monckton's successful songs included \"I Want to Go to Bye-Bye\", \"The Game That Ends with a Kiss\", and \"Powder on Your Nose\".\n\nMonckton was discouraged by Edwardes's death and unwilling to adapt his style of writing to the newly popular syncopated American dance rhythms, ragtime, and other \"noisy numbers\" that were heard in theatres. Although he contributed to some revues, including \"Bric à Brac\" (1915, including another song for Millar: \"Chalk Farm to Camberwell Green\"), \"We're All in it\", and \"Airs and Graces\", he had little enthusiasm for this, or for other new forms of musical entertainment, and he soon retired from composing. Monckton's music remained popular in Britain until after World War II, when American musicals took over the stage and even into the later half of the 20th century, in the case of his most popular shows.\n\nMonckton died in his home in London at the age of 62 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery. Monckton left an estate valued at £79,518 Later the same year, his widow remarried William Humble Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley, becoming the Countess of Dudley.\n\n\nThis list includes only the shows where Monckton was the principal composer. Many of the shows to which he contributed songs also had very long runs.\n\n\"The Arcadians\" has been recorded in excerpt form on LP and complete on CD by Ohio Light Opera. Recordings by Gwen Catley and Marilyn Hill Smith of numbers from \"Our Miss Gibbs\" and \"The Quaker Girl\" have been issued on CD. The first CD recording dedicated to selections of Monckton's works (also including music by Howard Talbot and Paul Rubens) was released by Divine Art in 2003: \"The Monckton Album\" by Theatre Bel-Etage, conductor Mart Sander. Selections from \"The Arcadians, The Quaker Girl\" and \"The Cingalee\" are featured on this album.\n\nIn 2008, Hyperion released an audio CD recording of songs from many of Monckton's shows entitled \"Lionel Monckton (1861–1924): Songs from the Shows\".

{"id": "1997870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997870", "title": "Pass laws", "text": "Pass laws\n\nIn South Africa, pass laws were a form of internal passport system designed to segregate the population, manage urbanization, and allocate migrant labor. Also known as the natives law, pass laws severely limited the movements of not only black African citizens, but other people as well by requiring them to carry pass books when outside their homelands or designated areas. Before the 1950's, this legislation largely applied to African men, and attempts to apply it to women in the 1910s and 1950s were met with significant protests. Pass laws would be one of the dominant features of the country's apartheid system, until it was effectively ended in 1986.\n\nThe first internal passports in South Africa were introduced on 27 June 1797 by the Earl McCartney in an attempt to prevent natives from entering the Cape Colony. The Cape Colony was merged with other states in the region to form the Union of South Africa in 1910, under the UK. By this time, versions of pass laws existed elsewhere. A major boost for their utilization was the rise of the mining sector from the 1880s: pass laws provided a convenient means of controlling workers' mobility and enforcing contracts.\n\nIn 1896 the South African Republic brought in two pass laws which required Africans to carry a metal badge. Only those employed by a master were permitted to remain on the Rand. Those entering a \"labour district\" needed a special pass which entitled them to remain for three days.\n\nPass laws date “back to 1760 in the Cape when slaves moving between urban and rural areas were required to carry passes authorizing their travel”. The pass laws, “had entitled police at any time to demand that Africans show them a properly endorsed document or face arrest”, hindering their freedom of movement. This meant that it restricted where they could live, which in turn then “tied them to their white employers, underpinning a system of cheap labor and humiliating subjection”. Their implementation over time arose from two contradictory needs. Pass Laws have been due to two specific white needs. The white population in South Africa utilized these laws as “an ‘exclusionary’ need to obtain political security by controlling and policing the number of Africans in “white” areas, and an “inclusionary’ need to ensure a supply of cheap labor within these areas”. The legislation and practices associated with the pass Laws have changed over time. \n\nAs these demands and beliefs changed, so did the rights of the black population in South Africa. When the pass laws were implemented at the turn of the century, they “encouraged the flow of labor into ‘white’ agriculture and industry and to redistribute labor into geographical areas where it was needed”. This process would last until the 1950's, when the government opted to change the paradigm. This meant, “from 1950 onward the emphasis of the pass laws has been overtly exclusionary and directed to ‘relocating’ Africans from ‘white’ areas and containing them within the Bantustans”. Therefore, there has always been a tension between the white and black community in South Africa. This stemmed from the “efforts to use the pass system to balance white needs for security and labor”, while also creating laws that would allow for the control of the “African employment, housing, access to land, and citizenship”. Due to these laws, “over 17,745,000 Africans have been arrested or prosecuted” between 1916 and 1984. The policing of Africans has allowed for the whites to maintain dominance over the black population for the greater part of the 20th century. \n\nNot only did the focus on how to control change over time, but also whom to control. Initially and “historically the use of passes in South Africa as a form of labour control applied only to men”. This happened because “whenever attempts were made to extend the system to black women, mass protests quickly resulted”. There vociferous opposition to the pass laws are of no surprise, considering the “fact that black women in South Africa have traditionally taken a more active role in mass popular protest”, in comparison to men. The biggest manifestation was a phenomenon that occurred “during the 1950s when black women throughout the nation fiercely resisted official efforts to make them carry passes for the first time”. The history of the application of pass laws towards women was intertwined with the belief that it would benefit the black female population. The “municipal authorities argued that passes for women were necessary to combat illegal brewing and prostitution”. They hypothesized that if woman could prove that they made an honest living with a legal employment then they would not be allowed to resort to illegal activities since they would be evicted. This proved to be a futile system since it was easier for the women in illegal practices to get around the laws than the home-based workers. Regardless of the reasons and the people that these laws affected, they could never be truly justified, and could only be seen as a scheme to control the black population in South Africa. \n\nAs the years passed by, pass laws would be used less and less to prosecute people. There was a “decline in pass law prosecutions over the period 1968-1981”, which is not surprising considering “the new forms of tight influx controls”. There had been a radical change when the Riekert Commission recommended “that ‘unlawful occupation of accommodation by persons’, together with ‘unlawful employment’, be grounds for ‘repatriation’ of persons from white area”, which meant that they changed their enforcement to “being taken off the streets and into housing and factories”. Pass laws were repealed in 1986.\n\nThe Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923 deemed urban areas in South Africa as \"white\" and required all black African men in cities and towns to carry around permits called \"passes\" at all times. Anyone found without a pass would be arrested immediately and sent to a rural area. It was replaced in 1945 by the Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act, which imposed \"influx control\" on black men and also set up guidelines for removing people deemed to be living idle lives from urban areas. This act outlined requirements for African peoples' \"qualification\" to reside legally in white metropolitan areas. To do so, they had to have Section 10 rights, based on whether \n\n\nThe Black (Natives) Laws Amendment Act of 1952 amended the 1945 Native Urban Areas Consolidation Act, stipulating that all black people over the age of 16 were required to carry passes, and that no black person could stay in an urban area more than 72 hours unless allowed to by Section 10. The Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act of 1952, commonly known as the Pass Laws Act, repealed the many regional pass laws and instituted one nationwide pass law, which made it compulsory for all black South Africans over the age of 16 to carry the \"passbook\" at all times within white areas. The law stipulated where, when, and for how long a person could remain. \n\nThe document was similar to an internal passport, containing details on the bearer such as their fingerprints, photograph, the name of his/her employer, his/her address, how long the bearer had been employed, as well as other identification information. Employers often entered a behavioural evaluation, on the conduct of the pass holder. \n\nAn employer was defined under the law and could only be a white person. The pass also documented permission requested and denied or granted to be in a certain region and the reason for seeking such permission. Under the terms of the law, any government employee could strike out such entries, basically cancelling the permission to remain in the area.\n\nA passbook without a valid entry then allowed officials to arrest and imprison the bearer of the pass. These passes often became the most despised symbols of apartheid. The resistance to the Pass Law led to many thousands of arrests and was the spark that ignited the Sharpeville Massacre on March 21, 1960, and led to the arrest of Robert Sobukwe that day.\n\nColloquially, passes were often called the \"dompas\", literally meaning the \"dumb pass\" or domestic passport. \n\nApart from discrimination against black people, there was also discrimination against the so-called \"coloured people.\" The \"coloured\" included all Indians, Chinese and Arabs, as well as those of \"mixed\" black/white ethnicity. Indian people, for example, were barred from the Orange Free State.\n\nThese discriminatory regulations fueled growing discontent from the black population. The 1910s saw significant opposition to pass laws being applied to black women. \n\nIn 1919, the revolutionary syndicalist International Socialist League (South Africa), in conjunction with the syndicalist Industrial Workers of Africa and the early African National Congress, organised a major anti-pass campaign. \n\nThe 1950s saw the ANC begin the Defiance Campaign to oppose the pass laws. This conflict climaxed at the Sharpeville Massacre, where the anti-pass protestors led by the rival breakaway Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) surrounded the Sharpeville police station, prompting the police to open fire, killing 69 people and injuring over 180. Subsequent protests and strikes were met with major repression and the ANC and PAC were both banned.\n\nOn July 23, 1986, as part of a process of removing some apartheid laws, the South African government lifted the requirement to carry passbooks, although the pass law system itself was not yet repealed. The system of pass laws was formally repealed retroactive on April 23, 1986, with the Abolition of Influx Control Act. Helen Suzman (MP) mentioned the act as the most eminent reform of a government had ever introduced.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

When she did, she fell, sustaining injuries. Garratt brought an action against the child for battery.\n\nThe trial judge found in favor of Dailey stating, that there was no intent to harm the old lady. Garratt appealed to the Washington Supreme Court. The issue before the Court was whether a lack of intent to cause harm precludes a battery charge.\n\nRelying on the definition of battery from the Restatement of Torts, the Court held that battery could only be found if it is shown that the boy knew with \"substantial certainty\" that after the chair was moved Garratt would attempt to sit in the chair's original position. That is, the accused must be substantially certain that his action would result in the contact. The absence of an intent to injure or to play a joke is not sufficient to absolve the accused of liability. It is sufficient for the plaintiff to prove only that the accused had sufficient knowledge to foresee the contact with \"substantial certainty.\"\n\nThe Court, noting that a new trial was unnecessary, remanded the case back to the trial court for clarification of the boy's knowledge at the time. Subsequently, the trial Court found in favor of Garratt and was affirmed by the state Supreme Court.\n"}

He was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals as an undrafted free agent in 1987. He played college football at Notre Dame.\n\nCarney was also a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, San Diego Chargers, New Orleans Saints, Los Angeles Rams, Jacksonville Jaguars, Kansas City Chiefs, and New York Giants. He was a Pro Bowl selection with the Chargers in 1994 and with the Giants in 2008. When he was released from the Saints' active roster in December 2009, Carney was third on the NFL career scoring list with a career total of 2,044 points. He was the last remaining player from the 1980s still active in professional football. He has also worked as a kicking consultant for the Saints.\n\nCarney attended Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm Beach, Florida, and lettered in football. In football, he won All-State honors as a punter.\n\nCarney attended Notre Dame and played football there from 1984 to 1986. He was named to the Notre Dame's all time team by \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nAfter going undrafted in the 1987 NFL Draft, Carney was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals as an undrafted free agent. He was released prior to the regular season and spent the year out of football.\n\nCarney played five games for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers between 1988 and 1989. He converted two of five field goal attempts and all six extra point attempts.\n\nCarney attended training camp with the San Diego Chargers in 1990, but did not make the final roster.\n\nCarney played one game for the Los Angeles Rams in 1990, but did not attempt a field goal or extra point. He was the last remaining active Los Angeles Ram, until the team moved back to Los Angeles from St. Louis in 2016.\n\nCarney was re-signed by the Chargers during the 1990 season, appearing in 12 games for the team and converting 19 of 21 field goal attempts. He played 11 seasons with the Chargers through the 2000 season, earning his first Pro Bowl selection in 1994 after going 34-for-38 (89.5 percent) on field goal attempts as the Chargers made it to the Super Bowl. To this day, he remains the Chargers' all-time leading scorer.\n\nCarney signed with the New Orleans Saints as a free agent prior to the 2001 season.\n\nOn December 21, 2003, the Saints were trailing the Jaguars 20-13 with 7 seconds left in regulation. Quarterback Aaron Brooks threw the ball in a hurry to Donte Stallworth. As time expired, the Saints continued to lateral the ball around until eventually wide receiver Jerome Pathon scored a touchdown in what became known as the River City Relay. Carney was sent out to kick the extra point to tie the game up and force overtime. Instead, Carney pushed the ball wide right and the Saints lost 19-20.\n\nCarney kicked a game-winning field goal against the Carolina Panthers following Hurricane Katrina. He then appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" with quarterback Aaron Brooks on September 19, 2005 as the city celebrated this victory.\n\nOn April 5, 2007, Carney asked and was given permission to leave the Saints after their acquisition of kicker Olindo Mare.\n\nFollowing Week 1 of the 2007 NFL Season, Carney signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars replacing injured placekicker Josh Scobee. Carney appeared in eight games for the Jaguars in Scobee's absence, converting nine of 11 field goal attempts and 20 of 21 extra point attempts. He was released on November 19 upon Scobee's return.\n\nOn November 26, 2007, the \"Kansas City Star\" reported that the Kansas City Chiefs would sign Carney after holding tryouts to replace Dave Rayner – making Carney the fourth placekicker to play for the Chiefs within a one-year period, following Lawrence Tynes, Justin Medlock and Rayner. Carney appeared in five games for the Chiefs, going 3-for-3 on field goal attempts and 7-for-7 on extra point attempts.\n\nOn August 30, 2008, Carney signed with the New York Giants to fill in while Tynes recovered from a knee injury sustained in training camp. Although Tynes would eventually recover from his injury Carney continued to hold on to the starting position and Tynes was relegated to kickoff duties. At age 44, Carney was the oldest active NFL player during the 2008 season.\n\nAfter a near perfect season (35-for-38 on field goal attempts with two blocked), Carney was chosen as the starting kicker for the NFC for the 2009 Pro Bowl. Carney was not re-signed after his contract expired, leaving him a free agent entering the 2009 season.\n\nFollowing the announcement that New Orleans Saints placekicker Garrett Hartley would be suspended the first four games of the 2009 season, Carney returned to New Orleans on August 15 on a one-year contract.\nWith his start on November 30, he became the sixth player in NFL history to reach 300 career games. Carney was waived on December 22, two weeks after Hartley regained the starting job.\n\nOn December 24, 2009, the Saints announced that Carney had been hired as a \"kicking consultant\", with responsibility for the snap and hold as well as working on kicking with his successor, Hartley. The appointment meant that Carney was ineligible to kick for any team for the rest of the 2009 season. Carney remained with the Saints in this capacity through the playoffs, and received credit for his role in preparing the comparatively inexperienced Hartley to make a number of critical kicks that helped the Saints win their first Super Bowl.\n\nCarney started the 2010 season without a team. However, after Hartley missed 3 out of 7 field goal attempts during the Saints' first 3 games, including a short kick in overtime that would have won a game against the Atlanta Falcons, the Saints re-signed Carney (while also retaining Hartley) on September 28, 2010. The signing made him the oldest active player in the NFL at the age of 46. On October 3, 2010, he kicked three field goals in a Saints win against the Carolina Panthers, and became the third oldest player to play in an NFL game (behind only George Blanda and Morten Andersen). On October 12, the Saints released Carney for the third time. Carney would not sign with another NFL team. He is one of only two players (George Blanda) to play across 4 different decades.\n\n\nHe runs a pre-season kicking training camp in San Diego for professional kickers called \"The Launching Pad\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1997887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997887", "title": "Xenoestrogen", "text": "Xenoestrogen\n\nXenoestrogens are a type of xenohormone that imitates estrogen. They can be either synthetic or natural chemical compounds. Synthetic xenoestrogens include some widely used industrial compounds, such as PCBs, BPA, and phthalates, which have estrogenic effects on a living organism even though they differ chemically from the estrogenic substances produced internally by the endocrine system of any organism. Natural xenoestrogens include phytoestrogens which are plant-derived xenoestrogens. Because the primary route of exposure to these compounds is by consumption of phytoestrogenic plants, they are sometimes called \"dietary estrogens\". Mycoestrogens, estrogenic substances from fungi, are another type of xenoestrogen that are also considered mycotoxins.\n\nXenoestrogens are clinically significant because they can mimic the effects of endogenous estrogen and thus have been implicated in precocious puberty and other disorders of the reproductive system.\n\nXenoestrogens include pharmacological estrogens (estrogenic action is an intended effect, as in the drug ethinylestradiol used in contraceptive pill), but other chemicals may also have estrogenic effects. Xenoestrogens have been introduced into the environment by industrial, agricultural and chemical companies and consumers only in the last 70 years or so, but archiestrogens have been a ubiquitous part of the environment even before the existence of the human race given that some plants (like the cereals and the legumes) are using estrogenic substances possibly as part of their natural defence against herbivore animals by controlling their fertility.\n\nThe potential ecological and human health impact of xenoestrogens is of growing concern. The word xenoestrogen is derived from the Greek words ξένο (xeno, meaning foreign), οἶστρος (estrus, meaning sexual desire) and γόνο (gene, meaning \"to generate\") and literally means \"foreign estrogen\". Xenoestrogens are also called \"environmental hormones\" or \"EDC\" (Endocrine Disrupting Compounds). Most scientists that study xenoestrogens, including The Endocrine Society, regard them as serious environmental hazards that have hormone disruptive effects on both wildlife and humans.\n\nThe onset of puberty is characterized by increased levels of hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH triggers the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland, which in turn causes the ovaries to respond and secrete estradiol. Increases in gonadal estrogen promote breast development, female fat distribution and skeletal growth. Adrenal androgen and gonadal androgen result in pubic and axillary hair. Peripheral precocious puberty caused by exogenous estrogens is evaluated by assessing decreased levels of gonadotrophins.\n\nHormones or substances with hormone disrupting capability, such as the xenoestrogens in plastic, packaged,food and drink trays and containers, ( more so, when they've been heated in the Sun, or an oven ), may interfere with pubertal development by actions at different levels – hypothalamic-pituitary axis, gonads, peripheral target organs such as the breast, hair follicles and genitals. Exogenous man made chemicals that mimic estrogen can alter the functions of the endocrine system and cause various health defects by interfering with synthesis, metabolism, binding or cellular responses of natural estrogens.\n\nAlthough the physiology of the reproductive system is complex, the action of environmental exogenous estrogens is hypothesized to occur by two possible mechanisms. Xenoestrogens may temporarily or permanently alter the feedback loops in the brain, pituitary, gonads, and thyroid by mimicking the effects of estrogen and triggering their specific receptors or they may bind to hormone receptors and block the action of natural hormones. Thus it is plausible that environmental estrogens can accelerate sexual development if present in a sufficient concentration or with chronic exposure. The similarity in the structure of exogenous estrogens and the estrogens has changed the hormone balance within the body and resulted in various reproductive problems in females. The overall mechanism of action is binding of the exogenous compounds that mimic estrogen to the estrogen binding receptors and cause the determined action in the target organs.\n\nXenoestrogens have been implicated in a variety of medical problems, and during the last 10 years many scientific studies have found hard evidence of adverse effects on human and animal health.\n\nThere is a concern that xenoestrogens may act as false messengers and disrupt the process of reproduction. Xenoestrogens, like all estrogens, can increase growth of the endometrium, so treatments for endometriosis include avoidance of products which contain them. Likewise, they are avoided in order to prevent the onset or aggravation of adenomyosis. Studies have implicated observations of disturbances in wildlife with estrogenic exposure. For example, discharge from human settlement including runoff and water flowing out of wastewater treatment plants release a large amount of xenoestrogens into streams, which lead to immense alterations in aquatic life. With a bioaccumulation factor of 10 –10, fish are extremely susceptible to pollutants. Streams in more arid conditions are thought to have more effects due to higher concentrations of the chemicals arising from lack of dilution. Xenoestrogen is not good for the health of the uterus. It reduces the flexibility of the uterine walls. Xenoestrogen makes the uterine walls thinner and fragile.\n\nWhen comparing fish from above a wastewater treatment plant and below a wastewater treatment plant, studies found disrupted ovarian and testicular histopathology, gonadal intersex, reduced gonad size, vitellogenin induction, and altered sex ratios.\n\nThe sex ratios are female biased because xenoestrogens interrupt gonadal configuration causing complete or partial sex reversal. When comparing adjacent populations of white sucker fish, the exposed female fish can have up to five oocyte stages and asynchronously developing ovaries versus the unexposed female fish who usually have two oocyte stages and group-synchronously developing ovaries. Previously, this type of difference has only been found between tropical and temperate species.\n\nSperm concentrations and motility perimeters are reduced in male fish exposed to xenoestrogens in addition to disrupt stages of spermatogenesis. Moreover, xenoestrogens have been leading to vast amounts of intersex in fish. For example, one study indicates the numbers of intersex in white sucker fish to be equal to the number of males in the population downstream of a waste water treatment plant. No intersex members were found upstream from the plant. Also, they found differences in the proportion of testicular and ovarian tissue and its degree of organization between the intersex fish. Furthermore, xenoestrogens expose fish to CYP1A inducers through inhibiting a putative labile protein and enhancing the Ah receptor, which has been linked to epizootics of cancer and the initiation of tumors.\n\nThe induction of CYP1A has been established to be a good bioindicator for xenoestrogen exposure. In addition, xenoestrogens stimulate vitellogenin (Vtg), which acts as a nutrient reserve, and Zona readiata proteins (Zrp), which forms eggshells. Therefore, Vtg and Zrp are biomarkers to exposure for fish.\n\nAnother potential effect of xenoestrogens is on oncogenes, specifically in relation to breast cancer. Some scientists doubt that xenoestrogens have any significant biological effect, in the concentrations found in the environment. However, there is substantial evidence in a variety of recent studies to indicate that xenoestrogens can increase breast cancer growth in tissue culture.\n\nIt has been suggested that very low levels of a xenoestrogen, Bisphenol A, could affect fetal neural signalling more than higher levels, indicating that classical models where dose equals response may not be applicable in susceptible tissue. As this study involved intra-cerebellar injections, its relevance to environmental exposures is unclear, as is the role of an estrogenic effect compared to some other toxic effect of bisphenol A.\n\nOther scientists argue that the observed effects are spurious and inconsistent, or that the quantities of the agents are too low to have any effect. A 1997 survey of scientists in fields pertinent to evaluating estrogens found that 13 percent regarded the health threats from xenoestrogens as \"major,\" 62 percent as \"minor\" or \"none,\" and 25 percent were unsure.\n\nThere has been speculation that falling sperm counts in males may be due to increased estrogen exposure in utero. Sharpe in a 2005 review indicated that external estrogenic substances are too weak in their cumulative effects to alter male reproductive functioning, but indicates that the situation appears to be more complex as external chemicals may affect the internal testosterone-estrogen balance.\n\nThe ubiquitous presence of such estrogenic substances is a significant health concern, both individually and for a population. Life relies on the transmission of biochemical information to the next generation, and the presence of xenoestrogens may interfere with this transgenerational information process through \"chemical confusion\" (Vidaeff and Sever), who state: \"The results do not support with certainty the view that environmental estrogens contribute to an increase in male reproductive disorders, neither do they provide sufficient grounds to reject such a hypothesis.\"\n\nA 2008 report demonstrates further evidence of widespread effects of feminizing chemicals on male development in each class of vertebrate species as a worldwide phenomenon. 99% percent of over 100,000 recently introduced chemicals are underregulated, according to the European Commission.\n\nAgencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Organization International Programme on Chemical Safety are charged to address these issues.\n\nPuberty is a complex developmental process defined as the transition from childhood to adolescence and adult reproductive function. The first sign of female puberty is an acceleration of growth followed by the development of a palpable breast bud (thelarche). The median age of thelarche is 9.8 years. Although the sequence may be reversed, androgen dependent changes such as growth of axillary and pubic hair, body odor and acne (adrenarche) usually appears 2 years later. Onset of menstruation (menarche) is a late event (median 12.8 years), occurring after the peak of growth has passed.\n\nPuberty is considered precocious (precocious puberty) if secondary sex characteristics occur before the age of 8 in girls and 9 years in boys. Increased growth is often the first change in precocious puberty, followed by breast development and growth of pubic hair. However, thelarche, adrenarche, and linear growth can occur simultaneously and although uncommon, menarche can be the first sign. Precocious puberty can be classified into central (gonadotropin-dependent) precocious puberty or peripheral (gonadotropin-independent) puberty. Peripheral precocious puberty has been linked to exposure to exogenous estrogenic compounds.\n\nAge of onset of puberty is influenced by many factors such as genetics, nutritional status, ethnicity and environmental factors including socio-economic conditions and geographical location. A decline of age at onset of puberty from 17 years of age to 13 years of age has occurred over a period of 200 years until the middle of the 20th century. Trends toward earlier puberty have been attributed to improved public health and living conditions. A leading hypothesis for this change toward early puberty is improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat deposition. However, many opponents believe that chemical exposure may play a role. Two recent epidemiologic studies in the United States (PROS and NMANES III) highlighted a recent unexpected advance in sexual maturation in girls. American, European and Asian studies suggest breast development in girls occurs at a much younger age than a few decades ago, irrespective of race and socioeconomic conditions. Environmental chemical exposure is one of the factors implicated in the recent downward trend of earlier sexual maturation.\n\nSince 1979, pediatric endocrinologists in Puerto Rico recognized an increase in number of patients with premature thelarche. The presence of phthalates were measured in the blood of 41 girls experiencing early onset breast development and matched set of controls. The average age of girls with premature thelarche was 31 months. They found high phthalate levels in the girls suffering from premature thelarche compared to the controls. Not all cases of premature thelarche in the study sample contained elevated levels of phthalate esters and there was concern whether artificial contamination from vinyl lab equipment and tubing invalidated the results, hence weakening the link between exposure and causation.\n\nDr. Massart and colleagues from the University of Pisa studied the increased prevalence of precocious puberty in a region of northwest Tuscany. This region of Italy is represented by a high density of navy yards and greenhouses where exposures to pesticides and mycoestrogens (estrogens produced by fungi) are common. Although unable to identify a definitive cause of the high rates of precocious puberty, the authors concluded environmental pesticides and herbicides may be implicated.\n\nAnimal feed was contaminated with several thousand pounds of polybrominated biphenyl in Michigan in 1973 resulting in high exposures of PBB in the population via milk and other products from contaminated cows. Perinatal exposure of children was estimated by measuring PBB in serum of mothers some years after exposure. Girls that had been exposed to high PBB levels through lactation had an earlier age of menarche and pubic hair development than girls who had less perinatal exposure. The study noted there no differences found in the timing of breast development among the cases and controls.\n\nThe Great Lakes have been polluted with industrial wastes (mainly PCBs and DDT) since the beginning of the 20th century. These compounds have accumulated in birds and sports fish. A study was designed to assess the impact of consumption of contaminated fish on pregnant women and their children. Concentrations of maternal serum PCB and DDE and their daughters' age at menarche were reviewed. In multivariate analysis, DDE but not PCB was linked with a lowered age of menarche. Limitations of the study included indirect measurement of the exposure and self reporting of menarche.\n\nPrecocious puberty has numerous significant physical, psychological and social implications for a young girl. Unfortunately, premature pubertal growth spurt and accelerated bone maturation will result in premature closure of distal epiphysis which causes reduced adult height and short stature. In 1999, US Food and Drug Administration has recommended to not take estrogen in food of more than 3.24 ng per day for females. Precocious puberty has also been implicated in pediatric and adult obesity. Some studies have suggested precocious puberty places girls at a higher risk of breast cancer later in life. Precocious puberty is linked with other gynecologic disorders such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome and infertility. Precocious puberty can lead to psychosocial distress, a poor self-image, and poor self-esteem. Girls with secondary sex characteristics at such a young age are more likely to be bullied and suffer from sexual abuse. Studies indicate that girls who become sexually mature at earlier ages are also more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors such as smoking, alcohol or drug use, and engage in unprotected sex.\n\nThe current literature is inadequate to provide the information we need to assess the extent to which environmental chemicals contribute to precocious puberty. Gaps in our knowledge are the result of limitations in the designs of studies, small sample sizes, challenges to conducting exposure assessment and the few number of chemicals studied. Unfortunately exposure is inferred and not actually measured in available studies. The ability to detect the possible role of chemicals in altering pubertal development is confounded by many nutritional, genetic and lifestyle factors capable of affecting puberty and the complex nature of the reproductive endocrine system. Other research challenges include shifts in exposure levels among populations over time and simultaneous exposures to multiple compounds. Overall the literature does not with certainty support the contention that environmental chemicals or dietary factors are having widespread effects on human sexual development. However data does not refute such a hypothesis either. Accelerated sexual development is plausible in individuals exposed to high concentration of estrogenic substances. There is a concerning steady increase in exposure to a wide variety of xenoestrogens in the industrial world. Further research is needed to assess the impact of these compounds on pubertal development.\n\nNon-human animal studies have shown that exposure to environmental contaminants with estrogenic activity can accelerate the onset of puberty. A potential mechanism has been described in rats exposed to DDT or beta-estradiol in which GnRH pulsatile secretion was found to be increased. Oral exposure of female rats to xenoestrogens has been shown to cause pseudo precocious puberty (early vaginal opening and early first estrus). A study of dioxin in immature female rats induced early follicular development and phthalates are known to decrease the anogenital distance in newborn rats. Although this article focuses on the effects of xenoestrogens and reproductive function in females, numerous animal studies also implicate environmental estrogens' and androgens' adverse effects on the male reproduction system. Administration of estrogens to developing male animals reduces testicular weight and decreases sperm production. The small phallus size of male alligators has been linked to contamination of their natural Florida habitat with DDT. Data from animal research is abundant demonstrating the adverse effects on reproduction of hormonally active compounds found in the environment.\n\nAtrazine is widely used as an herbicide to control broad-leaf weed species that grow in crops such as corn, sugarcane, hay and winter wheat. Atrazine is also applied to Christmas trees, residential lawns, golf courses, and other recreational areas. Atrazine is the second largest selling pesticide in the world and estimated to be the most heavily used herbicide in the United States.\n\nBPA (Bisphenol A) is the monomer used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins used as a lining in most food and beverage cans. BPA global capacity is in excess of per year and thus is one of the highest-volume chemicals produced worldwide. The ester bonds in the BPA-based polycarbonates could be subject to hydrolysis and leaching of BPA. But in the case of epoxypolymers formed from bisphenol A, it is not possible to release bisphenol A by such a reaction. It is also noteworthy that, of the bisphenols, bisphenol A is a weak xenoestrogen. Other compounds, such as bisphenol Z, have been shown to have stronger estrogenic effects in rats.\n\nIt has been suggested that biphenol A and other xenoestrogens might cause disease to humans and animals. One review suggests that bisphenol A exposure as a result of feasible scenarios could cause disease in humans.\n\nBisphenol S (BPS), an analog of BPA, has also been shown to alter estrogenic activity. One study demonstrated that when cultured rat pituitary cells were exposed to low levels of BPS, it altered the estrogen-estradiol signaling pathway and led to the inappropriate release of prolactin.\n\nDDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) was widely used in pesticides for agriculture until it was banned in 1972 in the United States due to its hazardous effects on the environment. DDT continues to be used in many parts of the world for agricultural use, insect control and to fight the spread of malaria. DDT and its metabolites DDE and DDD are persistent in the environment and accumulate in fatty tissues.\n\nDioxin, a group of highly toxic chemicals are released during combustion processes, pesticide manufacturing and chlorine bleaching of wood pulp. Dioxin is discharged into waterways from pulp and paper mills. Consumption of animals fats is thought to be the primary pathway for human exposure.\n\nEndosulfan is an insecticide used on numerous vegetables, fruits, cereal grains and trees. Endosulfan can be produced as a liquid concentrate, wettable powder or smoke tablet. Human exposure occurs through food consumption or ground and surface water contamination.\n\nPBB (Polybrominated biphenyls) are chemicals added to plastics used in computer monitors, televisions, textiles and plastics foams to make them more difficult to burn. Manufacturing of PBBs in the United States stopped in 1976, however because they do not degrade easily PBBs continue to be found in soil, water and air.\n\nPCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls) are man made organic chemicals known as chlorinated hydrocarbons. PCBs were manufactured primarily for use as insulating fluids and coolants given their chemical stability, low flammability and electrical insulating properties. PCBs were banned in 1979 but like DDT continue to persist in the environment.\n\nPhthalates are plasticizers providing durability and flexibility to plastics such as polyvinyl chloride. High molecular weight phthalates are used in flooring, wall coverings and medical device such as intravenous bags and tubing. Low molecular weight phthalates are found in perfumes, lotions, cosmetics, varnishes, lacquers and coatings including timed releases in pharmaceuticals.\n\nZeranol is currently used as an anabolic growth promoter for livestock in the US and Canada. It has been banned in the EU since 1985, but is still present as a contaminant in food through meat products that were exposed to it.\n\n"}

He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his 1927 play, \"In Abraham's Bosom\", which was included in Burns Mantle's \"The Best Plays of 1926-1927\". \n\nHis play \"The Lost Colony\" has been regularly produced since 1937 near Manteo, North Carolina, and the historic colony of Roanoke. Its success has resulted in numerous other historical outdoor dramas being produced; his work is still the longest-running. \n\nBorn in Buies Creek, in Harnett County, near Lillington, North Carolina, Green was educated at Buies Creek Academy. (It developed as what is now known as Campbell University). He went on to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he joined the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies and the Carolina Playmakers. Green also studied at Cornell University.\n\nGreen first attracted attention with his 1925 one-act play \"The No 'Count Boy\", which was produced by the New York Theatre Club. The next year his full-length play \"In Abraham's Bosom\" (1926) was produced by the Provincetown Players and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The play was considered remarkable for its depiction of African Americans in the South. Its hero, a man of mixed-race ancestry, finds his idealistic attempts to better the lives of the African Americans around him doomed to failure. With this success, Green was recognized as one of the leading regional voices in the American theatre. His plays were often compared with the folk plays of Irish playwright John Millington Synge. This included his 1926 play, \"The Last of the Lowries\", a fictional account of Henry Berry Lowry, a mixed-race leader of the Lumbee people during and after the Civil War.\n\nGreen's \"The House of Connelly\" was a tragedy of the decline of an old Southern family. It was chosen by the newly formed Group Theatre for its inaugural production. Often compared to Anton Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\" in its contrast of aristocratic decay and parvenu energy, \"The House of Connelly\" was praised by critic Joseph Wood Krutch as Green's finest play to date.\n\nBut Green had begun to shift from the realistic style of his early work. In 1928–29 he traveled to Europe on a Guggenheim Fellowship and was impressed by the non-realistic productions that he saw there. He began to experiment with expressionism and the Epic theatre of Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator. In the 1930s Green largely abandoned the New York theatre, whose commercialism he found distasteful. His experiments in non-realistic drama, \"Tread the Green Grass\" (1932) and \"Shroud My Body Down\" (1934), both premiered in Chapel Hill. They were never professionally produced in New York.\n\nDuring the summer of 1936, Green, Cheryl Crawford, Kurt Weill and Weill's wife Lotte Lenya rented an old house in Nichols, Connecticut, near the summer rehearsal headquarters of the Group Theatre at Pine Brook Country Club. Green returned to the Group Theatre to write his pacifist musical play, \"Johnny Johnson\", with a score by Kurt Weill. In it, Green experimented with genre, writing the first act as a comedy, the second as a tragedy, and the third as a satire. During this time he had an affair with Lotte Lenya, which would be her first American love affair.\n\nThe production encountered problems of style early on: set designer Donald Oenslager designed the first act in poetic realism, the second in expressionism, and the final act in an extremely distorted style, director Lee Strasberg wanted to stage it realistically, and others in the company wanted it to be staged expressionistically throughout. Reviews ranged from the enthusiastic to the dismissive. The play closed after 68 performances.\n\nGreen created a new dramatic form that he called symphonic drama. Inspired by historical events, it incorporated music and pageantry, usually for outdoor performance. His first experiment in this form was \"Roll Sweet Chariot\" (1934), which ran for four performances on Broadway. Much more warmly received was the first of his outdoor symphonic dramas, \"The Lost Colony\" (1937), with music by Lamar Stringfield. Based on the Lost Colony of Roanoke and produced during the Great Depression, it is still produced during the summers in an outdoor theater at Fort Raleigh National Historic Site near Manteo, North Carolina. \"The Lost Colony\" is the oldest outdoor historical drama in the United States and is one of three still being performed. It has become a community institution.\n\nAmong Green's other outdoor symphonic dramas are \"Faith of Our Fathers\", \"Wilderness Road\", \"Texas\", \"The Common Glory\"; \"The Founders\"; and \"Trumpet in the Land\", which tells the story of the European-American massacre of Native American Christian Moravians in Gnadenhutten, Ohio, during the American Revolution; \"Cross and Sword\", the state play of Florida; and \"The Stephen Foster Story\", which continues to be played each summer in Bardstown, Kentucky.\n\nThe little one-room house where Green conducted much of his writing has been moved to the North Carolina Botanical Garden in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\n\nGreen also wrote screenplays: \"The Cabin in the Cotton\" (1932) and \"State Fair\" (1933). He also wrote extensively on the subject of his beloved North Carolina. He helped Richard Wright adapt his novel \"Native Son\" for the stage in 1940. \nGreen founded the North Carolina Symphony Orchestra and the Institute for Outdoor Drama. He served UNESCO traveling around the world to lecture on human rights and drama. Green served as a professor of drama at UNC until his death in 1981.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1997906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997906", "title": "Arch of Hadrian (Athens)", "text": "Arch of Hadrian (Athens)\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian (), most commonly known in Greek as Hadrian's Gate (), is a monumental gateway resembling – in some respects – a Roman triumphal arch. It spanned an ancient road from the center of Athens, Greece, to the complex of structures on the eastern side of the city that included the Temple of Olympian Zeus. It has been proposed that the arch was built to celebrate the \"adventus\" (arrival) of the Roman Emperor Hadrian and to honor him for his many benefactions to the city, on the occasion of the dedication of the nearby temple complex in 131 or 132 AD. It is not certain who commissioned the arch, although it is probable that the citizens of Athens. There were two inscriptions on the arch, facing in opposite directions, naming both Theseus and Hadrian as founders of Athens. While it is clear that the inscriptions honor Hadrian, it is uncertain whether they refer to the city as a whole or to the city in two parts: one old and one new. The early idea, however, that the arch marked the line of the ancient city wall, and thus the division between the old and the new regions of the city, has been shown to be false by further excavation. The arch is located 325m southeast of the Acropolis.\n\nThe entire monument is made of Pentelic marble, from Mt. Pentelikon, 18.2 km northeast of the arch. Pentelic marble was used for the Parthenon and many other notable structures in Athens, although its quality can vary significantly. The marble used for the arch is of a lower grade that had more inclusions than that used in the best Athenian buildings. The arch was constructed without cement or mortar from solid marble, using clamps to connect the cut stones. It is 18m high, 13.5m wide, and 2.3m in depth. Its design is fully symmetrical from front to back and side to side.\n\nThe single arched passageway of the lower level is 6.5m wide and was supported by pilasters crowned with Corinthian capitals. Similar, but taller, pilasters flank the outer corners of the lower level. The space between the outer pilasters and the arched opening was filled in with squared stones with drafted edges to emphasize the design. On either side of the central passageway was a Corinthian column on a rectangular, raised base projecting from the center of the wall. The lower level was crowned with an Ionic architrave capped with dentils and a projecting geison.\n\nThe upper level of the arch (the attic) was composed of a series of Corinthian columns and pilasters dividing the space into three rectangular openings. Each of the outer openings was crowned with an Ionic architrave capped with dentils and a projecting geison, in the manner of the lower level. The central opening, however, was flanked by antae with engaged Corinthian half-columns that supported a projecting triangular pediment, which rested above the dentils, \"geison\", and sima that joined to those of the two wings. At the peak of the pediment, there was a small vegetal \"acroterion\". The central opening of the upper level was originally closed off by a thin screen of stone, c. 7 cm thick. Only the slots for its mounting are now preserved. The design of this central \"aediculum\"-like, niche of the upper level is similar to the architecture of the \"scaenae frons\" (façade of ancient stage buildings) and highly evocative of the representations of \"aedicula\" in wall painting of the 2nd Pompeian style.\n\nEven a casual examination of this arch, with a few of the many preserved Roman triumphal arches in mind, reveals the significant design variation between the two structures. The number of arched passageways of the lower level of Roman triumphal arches was variable as was the presence of a secondary passageway along the long axis of the structure; as a dipylon arch with a single passageway, the lower level of the Arch of Hadrian falls within the gamut of the architectural genre. Roman triumphal arches, however, typically have a massive, solid attic (upper level), often filled with a dedicatory inscription and sculptural decoration. In addition, Roman arches typically supported major stone or bronze statuary, often including a quadriga (four-horse chariot) or similar at top center. As Willers notes, the design of the Arch of Hadrian has a very refined upper level that does not allow the mounting of major decoration on top of the attic.\n\nIt has been proposed that there were statues positioned on top of the lower level, on either side of the central, \"aediculum\"-like, niche of the upper level, as was common for this architectural form; Theseus and Hadrian are the most commonly advanced candidates for these two statues, based on the inscriptions. Ward-Perkins has proposed that the attic held additional multiple statues, located over the projecting Corinthian columns of the lower level. In stark opposition to these proposals, Willers states that there is no evidence of the type of doweling needed to mount statuary on the top of the lower level and that the stone is far too roughly worked on the upper surface for statues to rest on it. Although Willers has done an excellent study of the lower level of the arch, permission was not granted for close study of the upper level, so his statements concerning the upper level are based on previously published measurements and images. A complete investigation of the monument, perhaps with limited excavation of the foundations as Willers suggests, remains to be done.\n\nTwo inscriptions are carved on the architrave of the arch’s lower level, one centered over the arched opening on either side. On the northwest side (towards the Acropolis), the inscription was: \nThe inscription on the southeast side (facing the Olympeion) reads: \n\nAdams has proposed that the inscriptions, rather than dividing Athens into an old city of Theseus and a new city of Hadrian (\"Hadrianopolis\"), claim the entire city as a refoundation by the emperor. In this view, the inscriptions should be read: this is Athens, once the city of Theseus; this is the city of Hadrian, and not of Theseus. One option claims a part and the other the whole of Athens for the emperor. Adams has also challenged the idea that the arch was on the line of the Themistocleian wall, and this position has now been generally accepted. A gate of the Themistocleian wall has been excavated c. 140m east of the arch, which has settled the question. Stuart and Revett, who did the earliest and only complete architectural study of the arch in 1751-53 CE, were perplexed by the fact that the arch is not aligned with the Temple of Olympian Zeus, despite the fact that it is only c. 20m from the \"peribolos\" wall (boundary wall) of that complex. Excavations in the intervening time have shown that the arch is aligned with an ancient road that was roughly on the same course as modern Lysikrates street. The arch faces the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates 207m to the northwest along this street.\n\nAt the time that it was recorded architecturally by Stuart and Revett in the mid-18th century, the base of the arch was buried in earth only to the level of around three feet. Given that it was thus never protected by being buried during its nearly nineteen centuries of existence, the arch entered the modern era in extraordinary condition. Although the columns of the lower level are missing, the arch is preserved to its full height and towers over modern Amalias Avenue. In recent decades, atmospheric pollution has damaged the monument. There is extensive discoloration of the stone and degradation of the inscriptions.\n\nPatronage of the arch has been attributed to either the Athenian state or to the \"Panhellenes\", a newly formed association of all the Greek cities, based in Athens. Early scholarship held that the Athenians were responsible for its creation, on the argument that the quality of material and execution did not equal the other known buildings of Hadrian in Athens, and on the assumption that an emperor who loved Athens so much could not have been so arrogant as to put such an inscription on a structure of his own making. Two arches of the same scale and design were constructed at the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis later in the 2nd century CE and dedicated to an emperor (perhaps Marcus Aurelius) by the Panhellenes. These arches flanked the propylon into the sanctuary and stood at the ends of roads to Megara and to a harbor respectively. The southeastern arch had an inscription that read: \nThe use of the same design to honor two emperors within the space of a few decades and a few kilometers has prompted the idea that the \"Panhellenes\" were responsible for the arches in both locations.\n\n"}

{"id": "1997919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997919", "title": "Sweet Auburn", "text": "Sweet Auburn\n\nThe Sweet Auburn Historic District is a historic African-American neighborhood along and surrounding Auburn Avenue, east of downtown Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The name Sweet Auburn was coined by John Wesley Dobbs, referring to the \"richest Negro street in the world,\" one of the largest concentrations of African-American businesses in the United States. A National Historic Landmark District was designated in 1976, covering of the neighborhood, significant for its history and development as a segregated area under the state's Jim Crow laws.\n\nSweet Auburn is one of 242 officially recognized neighborhoods of Atlanta. It is bounded by:\n\nThe first settlement here was on land formerly occupied by Union troops and was called Shermantown for many years. It developed quickly being near the Georgia Railroad and in 1879 was at the endpoint of a newly graded road called simply Boulevard, which led from the railroad to North Avenue near Ponce de Leon Avenue and Angier Springs.\n\nThe rise of Auburn Avenue as \"the\" black business district in Atlanta was to a great extent an outcome of the 1906 Atlanta Race Riot. Prior to this time black businesses operated largely in downtown Atlanta — a business district integrated as far as business ownership was concerned. But competition between working-class whites and blacks for jobs and housing gave rise to fears and tensions. In 1906, print media fueled these tensions with hearsay about alleged sexual assaults on white women by black men, triggering the riot, which left at least 27 people dead (25 of them black) and over 70 injured.,\n\nBlack businesses started to move from previously integrated business district downtown to the relative safety of the area around the Atlanta University Center west of downtown, and to Auburn Avenue in the Fourth Ward east of downtown. \"Sweet\" Auburn Avenue became home to Alonzo Herndon's Atlanta Mutual, the city's first black-owned life insurance company, and to a celebrated concentration of black businesses, newspapers, churches, and nightclubs. In 1956, \"Fortune\" magazine called Sweet Auburn \"the richest Negro street in the world\", a phrase originally coined by civil rights leader John Wesley Dobbs from the poem \"The Deserted Village\" by Oliver Goldsmith. Sweet Auburn and Atlanta's black colleges formed the nexus of a prosperous black middle class and upper class which arose despite enormous social and legal obstacles.\n\nSweet Auburn was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. However, like so many other inner-city neighborhoods, Sweet Auburn fell victim to lack of investment, heavy, widespread crime, homelessness, and abandonment, compounded by construction of the Downtown Connector freeway that split it in two. In 1992 the National Trust for Historic Preservation recognized that it was one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places and, in 2005, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation included the area in its 2006 list of \"Places in Peril\". The Historic District Development Corporation (HDDC) was formed to turn the trend around, starting with houses surrounding the birth home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and working outward. In 2014, the city of Atlanta completed the installation of the Atlanta Streetcar, a line that creates a loop connecting the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site to downtown and the tourist attractions of Centennial Olympic Park. The streetcar travels east along Edgewood Avenue and west along Auburn Avenue.\n\nSeveral churches located along the avenue, such as Big Bethel AME and First Congregational, helped build and maintain the heritage of the street. The Royal Peacock Club provided an elegant setting where many African Americans could perform and bring the changing styles of black popular music to Atlanta. Originally called the Top Hat Club when it opened in 1938, the club hosted local talent and national acts such as B.B. King, the Four Tops, the Tams and Atlanta's own Gladys Knight. One of the many significant commercial buildings within the district is the Atlanta Life Insurance Company. The second-largest black insurance company in the United States, Atlanta Life Insurance was founded in 1905 by Alonzo Herndon, a former slave from Walton County, Georgia. The central building of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company complex is a Beaux Arts building facing Auburn Avenue. The district also includes the Rucker Building, Atlanta's first black-owned office building, constructed in 1904 by businessman and politician Henry A. Rucker. For more information about the less well known Henry Allen Rucker, visit The Atlanta History Center Archives and access Terminus, one of the center's databases. (These collections contain data and images of nearly every notable African American in Atlanta and beyond dating from Reconstruction into the late 1970s.) Also located on Auburn Avenue was The \"Atlanta Daily World\", the first black-owned daily newspaper, which was founded here in 1928. (The \"Atlanta Daily World\" is still the nation's longest running African American newspaper.) In 1948, the Atlanta Police Department was integrated, hiring eight black police officers, all of whom were assigned to Auburn Avenue.\n\n\nSweet Auburn celebrates the annual Auburn SpringFest, and in the Fall, the Sweet Auburn Heritage Festival. The Sweet Auburn Heritage Festival is an annual festival held the first weekend in October on Auburn Avenue. Civil rights leader Hosea Williams founded the first festival in 1984. Charles Johnson founded the festival in 1994 as a way to celebrate the African American achievements as established on Auburn Avenue. The festival offers food, art, and entertainment throughout the day while celebrating Auburn Avenue's past and growth, and is operated by the Sweet Auburn Committee.\n\nThe festival's entertainment varies from comedians to up and coming artist from diverse genres of music. The Sweet Auburn Heritage Festival searches for entertainment from cities such as Atlanta, Macon, Savannah, Augusta, Huntsville and Chattanooga in hopes to help non- established artist's path to stardom. Artist such as Usher Raymond, Outkast, India.Arie, and Raven-Symoné have started out performing on stage at the festival. Ultimately, the Sweet Auburn Heritage Festival entertainment has grown much farther than originally anticipated from its beginning stages in 1984.\n\nEdgewood Avenue which runs through the heart of Sweet Auburn has become a hotspot for viewing for street art in Atlanta. Works by international artists such as Sten Lex and local artists such as Dr. Dax and Chris Veal can be found on Edgewood Avenue and the surrounding streets. Several of the Sweet Auburn murals can be found on the Atlanta Street Art Map.\n\nThe Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History is an institution dedicated to preserving and highlighting African American culture and history.\n\n\"This article incorporates text from the National Park Service website, a work of the U.S. government, and therefore in the public domain.\"\n\n\n"}

She eventually made her way to New York City, where she worked as secretary to journalist Walter Lippmann of the New York Herald.\n\nSometime prior to March 1941, Mary Price allegedly agreed to furnish Jacob Golos, controller of the secret apparatus of the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA) on behalf of the Soviet Union, with all the information she could concerning the material Lippmann was writing and his contacts. Elizabeth Bentley was made the courier between Washington D.C., where Price worked, and New York City, where she and Golos lived together.\n\nPrice allegedly became a \"cut out\", or go-between, for government employees who were also members of the CPUSA secret apparatus. Among them were Maurice Halperin, Duncan Lee, Helen Tenney of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), Robert Miller of the U.S. State Department, and Michael Greenberg, an associate of presidential aide Lauchlin Currie. Lee was the personal assistant to OSS head General William J. Donovan, the first intelligence chief in America's newly created wartime intelligence agency. The material from Halperin was considered extremely valuable especially how it related to the Polish government in exile.\n\nMary Price's apartment in Washington eventually became the rendezvous point for meetings between Golos' courier and the Perlo group. Various members of the Perlo group would meet with Bentley every two or three weeks in the apartment. Those members delivering stolen intelligence materials included Victor Perlo, chief of the Aviation Section, War Production Board (WPB); Edward Fitzgerald of the WPB; Charles Kramer who worked for Senate Subcommittee on War Mobilization, the Office of Price Administration, and Senate Subcommittee on Wartime Health and Education throughout World War II; Allen Rosenberg, who was on the Board of Economic Warfare and became Chief of the Economic Institution Staff of the Foreign Economic Administration; and Donald Wheeler of the OSS Analysis division.\n\nSoviet intelligence considered the Perlo group to be an extremely valuable asset, and upon the death of Golos in late 1942, sought to control Mary Price directly.\n\nIskhak Akhmerov, chief of the NKGB illegal station in the U.S., wanted to establish her in an apartment in the Georgetown section of Washington for the sexual entrapment of blackmail victims.\n\nIn November 1944, Anatoly Gorsky reported to Moscow that according to Elizabeth Bentley, Price had begun a sexual relationship with one of her sources, Duncan Chaplin Lee. \"(Price) established an intimate relationship with (Lee), and she did not tell us about it until recently.\" Gorsky was concerned that this affair might result in Lee's exposure as a spy because his wife, who was also a member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), knew about his spying. \"(Lee) and (Price) met in two places, at her flat and at his. The meetings were held in the presence of (Lee's) wife, who was aware of her husband's secret work.\" Lee's wife discovered her husband's love affair and complained in a series of jealous scenes. The NKVD became worried about these developments and ordered her to stop serving as his courier.\n\nElizabeth Bentley claimed Price was psychologically unfit for further clandestine work. The head of the CPUSA, Earl Browder, later released her from the NKGB. Her code name used by Soviet intelligence was \"Dir\".\n\nPrice, by now retired from spying, returned to North Carolina around 1945 and organized the state chapter of a liberal group, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare. In 1948, Price became the head of the state's Progressive Party. As the Progressive Party nominee, she was the first woman to appear on the ballot as a candidate for Governor of North Carolina. After Bentley accused Price of being a spy in July of that year, she came in a distant third in the election, and moved back to Washington, D.C., where she worked at the embassy of Czechoslovakia. In later years, she married Charles Adamson and worked for the National Council of Churches. She died in California in 1980.\n\n"}

Its construction began in September 1937, and was slated for completion in 1943. Like most other Nazi monumental structures, however, its construction was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II and was never finished.\n\nAccording to Speer himself, it was inspired not by the Circus Maximus in Rome but by the Panathenaic Stadium of Athens, which had impressed him greatly when he had visited it in 1935. Speer's stadium was a gigantic inflation of its Greco-Roman model, from which he borrowed the horseshoe configuration and the propylaeum, now transformed into a raised, pillared, temple-like structure (\"Säulenvorhof\") attached to the open end of the stadium by an internally pillared courtyard. Since the stadium was not set like the Panathenaic Stadium structure at the bottom of a gully, but on a flat area of land (24 hectares), its five tiers of seats for 405,000 spectators had to be supported in the usual Roman manner by massive barrel vaults. The external façade of pink granite blocks, which would have risen to a height of about 90 metres, consisted of a series of arches 65 metres high resting on a podium of dark red granite. The arcade and podium again suggests a Roman, not a Greek, circus or stadium, which did not traditionally rest on a substructure. In order to deliver such a vast number of spectators to their seats quickly, express lifts were to be installed to take spectators 100 at a time to seats on the top three tiers. The short transverse axis of the stadium culminated at each of its ends in a raised \"Ehrentribüne\" (Tribune of Honour) for the Führer, special guests and the press. Once more, Roman practice provided the architectural precedent.\n\nSpeer apparently adopted a horseshoe shape for his building only after rejecting the oval shape of an amphitheatre. The latter plan, he claimed, would have intensified the heat and produced psychological discomfort, a comment he does not elucidate. When Speer remarked on the staggering cost of the building, Hitler, who laid its cornerstone on September 9, 1937, merely retorted that it would cost less than two battleships of the .\n\nWolfgang Lotz, writing about the stadium in 1937, commented that it would contain twice the number of spectators originally accommodated by the Circus Maximus. Inevitably for the period, he also emphasized the community feeling that such a building would engender between competitors and spectators:\nAs in ancient Greece, the elite and most experienced men chosen from the mass of the nation will compete against each other here. An entire nation in sympathetic wonder is seated on the tiers. Spectators and competitors merge in one unity.\nThe idea of staging Pan-Germanic athletic games here was perhaps suggested by the Panathenaic Games, but Speer's stadium was, despite his own statement, stylistically more Roman than Greek in inspiration and with its huge barrel-vaulted substructures and arcaded exterior facade, more like the \"Circus Maximus\" than the Panathenaic Stadium. Nazi building exhibits a mixture of Greek and Roman elements, with Roman predominating.\n\nBut Hitler did not want such a stadium to serve merely as a centre for German athletic sport. The restored Panathenaic Stadium had been used for the 1896 Summer Olympics and the 1906 Intercalated Games, held out of series. In 1936 these games were held in the \"Reichssportfeld\" in Berlin, but Hitler insisted that after 1940, when the games were to have been held in Tokyo, all future games were to be held in the \"Deutsches Stadion\". This stadium was in all its dimensions far larger than the 1936 Olympic Stadium in Berlin, which held only 115,000 spectators. Hitler anticipated that after winning the war, the world would have no choice but to send its athletes to Germany every time the Olympic Games were held at which, no doubt, victors would have received their prizes from the Führer, surrounded by the party faithful on the pulvinar on the short axis of the cavernous stadium .\n\nThe small village of Achtel in Hirschbach, Bavaria is the site of a sports grandstand constructed as a prototype for part of the \"Deutsches Stadion\". It was never used, and is now in a state of disrepair.\n\n\n"}

The role of Catherine Black in that series had been written with Gallagher in mind.\n\nGallagher was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on February 6, 1960, to Aileen and Donald Gallagher. She was the fifth of six children. Her mother had also been an actor in her youth, retiring when she began a family. Gallagher credits her own career to her mother, who would take her to Broadway theatre productions as a child. She has also cited Mary Tyler Moore and Katharine Hepburn as influences on her career. She attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School, where she elected not to attend her high school prom in order to continue her rehearsals at a local community theatre, Genesius Theatre.\n\nGallagher moved to New York to study acting at the Juilliard School under the tutelage of John Houseman. Included in her class were Penny Johnson Jerald, Lorraine Toussaint, Jack Kenny and Jack Stehlin. She then relocated to Los Angeles, California to further pursue her career; during this time she also took on a job taking care of stray cats.\n\nGallagher began her career on stage, appearing in a production of Paul Osborn \"Oliver Oliver\" before being cast in the 1989 Broadway production of Aaron Sorkin's \"A Few Good Men\". Her portrayal of LCDR JoAnne Galloway in the latter production earned her a Theatre World Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award. In 1993, she took part in Broadway productions of both parts of \"Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes\"—\"Millennium Approaches\" and \"Perestroika\".\n\nGallagher's television debut was in the miniseries \"George Washington\".

The state park is named for a string of large granite boulders which resemble a train of pink circus elephants. The park was created following the donation of the land to the state in 1967 by geologist Dr. John Stafford Brown. The park is used for picnicking, rock climbing, and trail exploration. It is managed by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe Elephant Rocks, for which Elephant Rocks State Park is named, is a pile of residual boulders of weathered Graniteville Granite. It is a medium- to coarse-grained, muscovite-biotite alkali granite that, on the average, consists of 55 percent alkali feldspar, 40 percent quartz, and less than 5 percent mafic minerals. The Graniteville Granite is a pluton formed 1.4 billion years ago in the Proterozoic by the cooling of magma that intruded into the volcanic strata and country rock associated with a collapsed caldera. Nearly vertical fractures formed in the stone as it cooled, and uplift of the granite enhanced the fracturing. Eventually the overlying strata were removed through erosion, exposing the granite pluton. Before it was exposed, groundwater weathered the granite along fracture joints creating corestones of relatively solid altered granite embedded within friable saprolite. Surface runoff later eroded the saprolite that once surrounded the corestones and left, what are now locally called \"elephant rocks\" as boulders perched on the ground surface.\n\nThe reddish or pink granite has been quarried in this area since 1869, and two abandoned granite quarries are within the park. These and others nearby have provided red architectural granite for buildings in states from Massachusetts to California, but most particularly in St. Louis, including stone for St. Louis City Hall and the piers of the Eads Bridge. Stones unsuitable for architectural use were made into shoebox-sized paving stones that were used on the streets of St. Louis as well as on its wharf on the Mississippi River. Stone quarried in the area currently is used for mortuary monuments and is known commercially as Missouri Red monument stone.\n\nA one-mile (2 km) circular interpretive trail in the Elephant Rocks Natural Area, called the Braille Trail, is the first in Missouri state parks designed specifically for visitors with visual and physical challenges. Spur trails off the main trail include one passing through \"Fat Man's Squeeze,\" a narrow gap between two boulders that leads hikers to an abandoned quarry, and another that goes through \"The Maze,\" a 100-foot (30.48 meter) section of scattered boulders. The park's picnicking area includes ADA-compliant facilities.\n\n"}
{"id": "1997957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997957", "title": "Crazing", "text": "Crazing\n\nCrazing is the phenomenon that produces a network of fine cracks on the surface of a material, for example in a glaze layer. Crazing frequently precedes fracture in some glassy thermoplastic polymers. As it only takes place under tensile stress, the plane of the crazing corresponds to the stress direction. The effect is visibly distinguishable from other types of fine cracking because the crazing region has different refractive indices from surrounding material. Crazing occurs in regions of high hydrostatic tension, or in regions of very localized yielding, which leads to the formation of interpenetrating microvoids and small fibrils. If an applied tensile load is sufficient, these bridges elongate and break, causing the microvoids to grow and coalesce; as microvoids coalesce, cracks begin to form.\n\nCrazing occurs in polymers, because the material is held together by a combination of weaker Van der Waals forces and stronger covalent bonds. Sufficient local stress overcomes the Van der Waals force, allowing a narrow gap. Once the slack is taken out of the backbone chain, covalent bonds holding the chain together hinder further widening of the gap. The gaps in a craze are microscopic in size. Crazes can be seen because light reflects off the surfaces of the gaps. The gaps are bridged by fine filament called fibrils, which are molecules of the stretched backbone chain. The fibrils are only a few nanometers in diameter, and cannot be seen with a light microscope, but are visible with an electron microscope.\n\nThe thickness profile of a crazing is like a sewing needle: the very tip of the crazing may be as thin as several atoms, as the distance from the tip increase, it tends to thicken gradually with the rate of the increase diminishing with distance. Therefore, the growth of crazing has a critical distance from the tip. The opening angle of the crazing lies between 2° to 10°. The boundary between crazing and surrounding bulk polymer is very sharp, the microstructure of which can be scaled down to 20Å or less, which means it can only be observed by electron microscopy.\n\nA craze is different from a crack in that it cannot be felt on the surface and it can continue to support a load. Furthermore, the process of craze growth prior to cracking absorbs fracture energy and effectively increases the fracture toughness of a polymer. The initial energy absorption per square meter in a craze region has been found to be up to several hundred times that of the uncrazed region, but quickly decreases and levels off. Crazes form at highly stressed regions associated with scratches, flaws, stress concentrations and molecular inhomogeneities. Crazes generally propagate perpendicular to the applied tension. Crazing occurs mostly in amorphous, brittle polymers like polystyrene (PS), acrylic (PMMA), and polycarbonate; it is typified by a whitening of the crazed region. The white colour is caused by light-scattering from the crazes.\n\nBesides, the production of crazing is a reversible process, after applied compressive stress or elevated temperature (higher than glass transformation temperature), it may disappear and the materials will return to optically homogeneous state.\n\nShear banding is the narrow region with high level of shearing strain from local strain softening, it is also very common during the deformation of thermoplastic materials. One of the main differences between crazing and shear banding, is that crazing occurs with an increase in volume, which shear banding does not. This means that under compression, many of these brittle, amorphous polymers will shear band rather than craze, as there is a contraction of volume instead of an increase. In addition, when crazing occurs, one will typically not observe \"necking,\" or concentration of force upon one spot in a material. Rather, crazing will occur homogeneously throughout the material.\n\nRubber particles are often used to toughen thermoplastic materials, after modified, the ability of absorbing energy will be increased significantly. For some brittle plastic materials, they can even go through brittle-ductile transformation. Previously, the rubber particles were considered as the main contributor to the increased energy absorption. It was proposed that rubber particles might gather around crack tips under tension and impede the growth of crack, or the contraction of rubber particles induced the decline of glass transformation temperature of the matrix. Nevertheless, experiments showed that the energy absorbed by rubber particles made up only 10% of the total energy, and the decrease of glass transformation temperature caused by rubber was only around 10 K, which was not enough for the matrix to yield at room temperature.\n\nSchmitt and Bucknall developed the mechanism of rubber toughening according to the existence of stress whitening and shear yielding when the stress is lower than fracture strength. They proposed that the rubber particles served as the center for stress concentration, hence initiated the brittle-ductile transformation and yielding of the matrix material. To specify, yielding happens in the form of crazing or shear band, which can consume a large portion of deformation energy.\n\nCrazing can take place in glassy polymers under environmental effects. It is troublesome because it requires a much lower stress state and sometimes it happens in a long delay, which means it's hard to detect and avoid. For example, the PMMA containers in daily use is quite resistive to humidity and temperature without any visible defects. But after they are machine-washed and then left in air for one or two days, they will shutter abruptly when wet with gin. During the process, the stress applied is negligible, but crazing is still found in the containers.\n\nThere are many theories that tried to explain the environmental effects upon formation of crazing, among which surface energy reduction and plasticization are widely accepted and well developed. To eliminate the environmental crazing and cracking, many methods like surface coating, stress reduction are adopted. However, due to the complicity of the environmental effects, especially the effects in organic environment, it's hard to find a general solution and remove the effect completely.\n\nCrazing is also seen on single ply roofing membranes, joint sealant, and on concrete when good concrete practices are not followed.\n\nCrazing is a glaze defect of glazed pottery. Characterised as a spider web pattern of cracks penetrating the glaze, it is caused by tensile stresses greater than the glaze is able to withstand. In pottery a distinction is often made between crazing, as an accidental defect, and \"crackle\", when the same phenomenon, often strongly accentuated, is produced deliberately. The Chinese in particular enjoyed the random effects of crackle and whereas in Ru ware it seems to have been a tolerated feature of most pieces, but not sought, in Guan ware a strong crackle was a desired effect.\n\nCrazing is also used as a term in odontology to describe fine cracks in the enamel of teeth.\n\nThe root sense of “crazy” in English, meaning “to shatter, crush, or break,” dates to the 1300s. The metaphorical senses familiar today derive from crazing in pottery: “crazy” meaning “diseased or sickly” dates to about 1570; “of unsound mind,” to about 1610.\n\n"}
{"id": "1997961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997961", "title": "Caroline Matilda of Great Britain", "text": "Caroline Matilda of Great Britain\n\nCaroline Matilda of Great Britain (; 22 July 1751 – 10 May 1775) was by birth a Princess of Great Britain and member of the House of Hanover and by marriage Queen consort of Denmark and Norway from 1766 to 1772.\n\nThe youngest and posthumous daughter of Frederick, Prince of Wales, by Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, Caroline Matilda was raised in a secluded family atmosphere away from the royal court. At the age of fifteen, she was married to her first cousin, King Christian VII of Denmark and Norway, who suffered from a mental illness and was cold to his wife throughout the marriage. She had two children: the future Frederick VI and Louise Augusta, whose biological father may have been the German physician Johann Friedrich Struensee.\n\nIn 1769, Struensee entered the service of the Danish king; initially Caroline Matilda treated him coldly, but he quickly won the Queen's heart and they began a love affair. Struensee gained more and more power and instituted a series of reforms that Caroline Matilda supported. Struensee's reforms and his relationship with the Queen generated powerful enemies, who included Christian VII's stepmother Queen Dowager Juliana Maria and her son Prince Frederick. Juliana Maria directed a plot to overthrow the lovers, which ended with the execution of Struensee and Caroline Matilda's divorce and banishment. She died in Celle, Hanover, at the age of twenty-three from scarlet fever.\n\nCaroline Matilda was born in Leicester House, London, on 22 July (11 July in the Old Style) 1751 as the ninth and youngest child of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. Her father died suddenly about three months before her birth, on 31 March 1751. At birth, she was given the style and title \"Her Royal Highness\" Princess Caroline Matilda, as daughter of the Prince of Wales, though by the time of her birth that title had passed to her brother George (who became King George III in 1761). Both of her names were used to distinguish her from her paternal aunt, Princess Caroline. \n\nThe princess was christened ten days after being born, on 1 August, at the same house, by the Bishop of Norwich, Thomas Hayter. Her godparents were her brother George, her aunt Caroline, and her sister Augusta.\n\nShe was brought up by her strict mother away from the English court and was described as natural and informal, and for this reason, she was uninterested in politics and court intrigues as an adult. She spent most of the time with her family in Leicester House, but during holidays they moved to Kew Palace. Caroline Matilda enjoyed outdoor life and riding, and, despite the irregularities of her and her sisters' education, she was musically gifted, an accomplished singer with a beautiful voice and also could speak three languages: Italian, French, and German.\n\nIn 1764, a marriage was suggested between the Danish House of Oldenburg and the British House of Hanover, specifically between Christian, Crown Prince of Denmark, and a British princess. The Danish Crown Prince was the oldest surviving son of King Frederick V and his first wife Princess Louise of Great Britain, and in consequence, first cousin of the children of the late Prince of Wales. The marriage was considered suitable because the British and Danish royal families were both Protestant and of the same rank, and thus had the same status as well as religion. Additionally, the deceased Queen Louise had been very popular in Denmark. Initially, the marriage negotiations were intended for the eldest unmarried daughter of the former Prince of Wales, Princess Louise Anne, but after the Danish representative in London, Count von Bothmer, was informed of her weak constitution, her younger sister Caroline Matilda was chosen for the match instead. The official betrothal was announced on 10 January 1765.\n\nOn 14 January 1766, in the middle of preparations for the wedding, King Frederick V died and his 17-year-old son became King Christian VII. On 1 October of that year in the royal chapel of St James's Palace (or according to other sources, in Carlton House) the marriage was celebrated by proxy, the groom being represented by Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany. Two days later, Caroline Matilda departed from Harwich for Rotterdam, and three weeks later she arrived in Altona, where she left her British entourage and was welcomed by her appointed Danish courtiers. Twelve days later, Caroline Matilda arrived in Roskilde, where she met her future husband. The official wedding ceremony took place on 8 November 1766 in the Royal Chapel at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen. Marriage celebrations and balls lasted for another month. On 1 May 1767, Caroline Matilda was crowned Queen of Denmark in Copenhagen.\n\nThe young Queen at the Danish court was described as particularly temperamental, vivid and charming. She was thought too plump to be described as a beauty, but she was considered attractive: it was said of her that \"her appearance allowed her to avoid criticism of women, but still captivate the male eye.\" However, her natural and unaffected personality was not popular at the strict Danish court, despite the fact that originally she was warmly received in Copenhagen. The weak-willed, self-centered, and mentally ill Christian VII was cold to his wife and not in a hurry to consummate the marriage. The reason for this attitude towards his wife could be that the King was actually forced to marry by the court, who believed that marriage would lead to improvement in his mental problems; in addition, part of the court felt that Christian VII preferred the company of men to women. Despite rumors of homosexuality, the King had a mistress with whom he began a relationship in Holstein in the summer of 1766, and often visited courtesans in Copenhagen, of which the most famous was Anna Katrina Bentgagen, nicknamed \"Støvlet-Cathrine\".\n\nCaroline Matilda became close to her \"Overhofmesterinde\", Louise von Plessen, who regarded the King's friends, such as Conrad Holck and Enevold Brandt, as immoral and acted to isolate Caroline Matilda from her spouse. This was not difficult, as Christian VII did not like her. The couple were further estranged when Louise von Plessen advised Caroline Matilda to claim to be indisposed when the King expressed a wish for physical intimacy, with the thought that distance would make the King more eager; instead, though, it only made him more unwilling. \nAt the end, and after being persuaded by his old tutor Reverdil, Christian VII consummated his marriage for the sake of the succession, and after the Queen gave birth to Crown Prince Frederick on 28 January 1768, he turned his interest to the brothels of Copenhagen.\n\nThough Caroline Matilda was not interested in politics, after the birth of an heir, she came to play a key role at the court. Her dislike of her husband's favourites increased when, in 1768, Holck managed to exile Louise von Plessen from court, leaving the Queen even more isolated. She refused to accept von Plessen's successor, Anne Sofie von Berckentin, whom she suspected had taken part in the plot to exile Plessen. Thus, Plessen was not replaced until Margrethe von der Lühe agreed to accept the post in 1768.\n\nIn May 1768 Christian VII took a long tour of Europe, including stays in Altona, Paris, and London. During his absence, Caroline Matilda took care of her son and aroused attention when she took walks in Copenhagen; this was considered scandalous, as royal and noble Danish women normally only traveled in town by carriage. Caroline Matilda spent the summer at Frederiksborg Castle with her son before returning to Copenhagen in the autumn. During the absence of the King, there were rumors about an affair of the Queen with a certain La Tour, a handsome actor and singer from the French-language theater \"Hofteatret\". La Tour was the lover of her lady-in-waiting Elisabet von Eyben, but he was known to receive gifts from \"a higher hand\" and it was said that his visits to von Eyben's chamber were in fact visits to the Queen. The allegation of an affair is not considered to have been true, but La Tour was exiled after the return of the King, perhaps because the rumor was damaging enough in itself. In addition to von Eyben, Caroline Matilda made friends with Christine Sophie von Gähler, Anna Sofie Bülow, and Amalie Sofie Holstein, who were known for their love affairs. According to the letter writer Luise Gramm, they encouraged her to participate more in social life, dance, and flirt.\n\nThe King returned to Copenhagen on 12 January 1769, bringing with him Johann Friedrich Struensee as Royal Physician. He had met Struensee in Altona at the beginning of his travels. During 1769, the King's mental health deteriorated, but Struensee could apparently handle the King's instability, which was a great relief to the King's advisers, and Christian VII developed a confidence in him. During 1769, Struensee encouraged the King in his attraction to Birgitte Sofie Gabel, reportedly because he believed a relationship with an intelligent woman would make the King more mentally stable and his insanity easier to handle, but this failed, and the attempt to provide the King with a mistress made the Queen hostile toward Struensee.\n\nAfter this, Struensee encouraged the King to improve his relationship with Caroline Matilda, and Christian VII showed his attention to her in the form of a three-day birthday party on 22 July 1769. The Queen was well aware that Struensee was behind these improvements, and her interest in the charming doctor developed. She was grateful that he improved the King's behavior towards her, thereby also improving her position at court. Later, in the summer of 1769, Caroline Matilda had an attack of dropsy, and at the insistence of her husband, she turned to Struensee. He advised the Queen that entertainment and exercise were the best medicine; the royal physician's advice helped Caroline Matilda, and Struensee gained credibility with her. Her confidence in him was further strengthened when Struensee successfully inoculated the infant Crown Prince Frederick against smallpox. The attraction that had arisen between the Queen and the Royal Physician amused the King, but it was initially caused by Struensee's desire to bring together Christian VII and his wife. In January 1770, Struensee was given his own rooms at Christiansborg Palace. In the meantime, the King became more and more passive, isolated and uninvolved in government as his mental health deteriorated. He entrusted more and more of the daily state affairs to Struensee, as he had by then become accustomed to trusting him.\n\nBy the spring of 1770, Struensee had become the Queen's lover. Later, during the divorce proceedings between Caroline Matilda and Christian VII, courtiers who accompanied the Queen during this time reported that they had suspected an affair since at least late 1769. The rumors forced the Queen to limit her contact with Struensee for a while, but not for long: by the summer of 1770 Caroline Matilda and Struensee were known to be close throughout the capital and the provinces. When the royal couple made a tour through the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein and the German border, accompanied by Struensee, he and the Queen were observed behaving in a suspicious manner towards each other, and rumors started spreading that they were lovers. With the help of Caroline Matilda, Struensee was able to expel Holck and other political enemies from court, including Margrethe von der Lühe, Holck's sister and Royal Mistress of the Robes, who, despite her blood relation with Caroline Matilda's enemy, was close to her.\n\nIn the summer of 1770, Caroline Matilda's mother, the Dowager Princess of Wales, made a visit to the continent, where for various reasons she wanted to communicate with her daughter. The meeting was originally scheduled in Brunswick, but later was moved to Lüneburg, where Caroline Matilda saw her mother not earlier than August 1770. It was the last meeting between them; reportedly, the Queen received her in breeches, which at that time was regarded as scandalous. During this meeting, Struensee was constantly at the Queen's side, so the Dowager Princess of Wales had no opportunity to talk freely with her daughter and could only instruct Woodford, the British Minister to Saxe-Lauenburg, to caution Caroline Matilda about her behaviour. In the end, neither Woodford nor the Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (who visited his sister in the same year in Copenhagen) succeeded in this purpose.\n\nIn September 1770 came the fall of the Chancellor Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff, reportedly thanks to the intrigues of both Struensee and Caroline Matilda; when the Dowager Princess of Wales asked her daughter about these rumors, the Queen responded to her mother's lamentations with an arrogant phrase: \"Pray, madam, allow me to govern my own kingdom as I please!\" On 18 December Struensee became \"Maître des Requêtes\" (\"Master of Queries\"; Privy Counsellor), and in July 1771 when he entered the cabinet it was declared that his orders would have the same effect as if they were signed by the King himself; on 22 July (the day of the Queen's birthday) the signatures of Struensee and his assistant Count Enevold Brandt were officially announced. From then, Struensee's authority became paramount, and he held absolute sway between 20 March 1771 and 16 January 1772: this period is known as the \"Time of Struensee\". \nOn 29 January 1771, in honor of the King's birthday, the Queen founded the \"Mathildeordenen\". The Order has one class, and was intended to honor the royal family and their closest friends. The badge of the Order was a monogram \"M\", framed by a circle of precious stones and branches covered with green enamel. The Order was suspended on a pink ribbon with three silver stripes. A man wore the Order on a tape around his neck, and a lady with a bow on the chest. The Order Charter consisted of seven articles, and was written in French. Presentation of the Order was held once in the same day, at the dinner in honor of the King's birthday: it was granted to twelve people, among whom were Caroline Matilda herself, Struensee, Christian VII, the Queen Dowager Juliana Maria, Prince Frederick (the King's half-brother), and Struensee's close friends. After the coup in 1772 that resulted in the execution of Struensee and the exile of Caroline Matilda, the Order was abolished.\n\nHaving virtually unlimited power, Struensee issued no fewer than 1069 cabinet orders, or more than three a day; for this reason, he has been criticised for having an imprudent \"mania\" for reform (despite the fact that all these orders were based on sound, rational principles) and because he did not follow native Danish and Norwegian customs, seeing them as prejudices and wanting to eliminate them in favor of abstract principles. This led to his extreme unpopularity among the conservative circles at court, led by the Dowager Queen Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and her son Prince Frederick. Caroline Matilda shared in her lover's unpopularity because of her support for his reforms and her behavior, which was offensive to a nation that had a traditional veneration for the royal house of Oldenburg, and brought the Crown into contempt: her way of openly demonstrating her new happiness was seen as shocking, as when the couple reportedly barely concealed their affair during the masked balls of Caroline von Schimmelmann.\n\nUntil now without influence, Caroline Matilda became the center of the Court's attention, and gathered followers called the \"Dronningens Parti\" (\"The Queen's Party\"). She gained a new confidence, and showed herself in public riding astride on horseback, dressed as a man. This was seen as scandalous, and according to Luise Gramm, she had been encouraged to do this by her lady-in-waiting Elisabet von Eyben. Struensee introduced a reform in which burgher-class people were allowed to dine informally with the royal family, and the Queen acquired friends outside the aristocracy such as Johanne Marie Malleville, which was seen as a scandal. \n\nOn 17 June 1771 the court took summer residence at Hirschholm Palace in present-day Hørsholm municipality. Here, Caroline Matilda lived happily with her son and her lover, and was painted with the Crown Prince in the style of the newly modern country life by Peter Als; this summer is described as an idyll. She also planned a new summer villa, Frydenlund in Vedbæk. One month later, on 7 July, the Queen gave birth to a second child, a daughter named Louise Augusta. The event was coldly received at court, although the Dowager Queen Juliana Maria agreed to be the newborn's godmother if the Queen agreed. The King recognised the paternity of the child, who officially became a Princess of Denmark and Norway, but the Queen's behavior and the girl's resemblance to Struensee caused the courtiers to begin to think that he was probably the biological father of the princess, and to refer to her as \"\"la petite Struensee\"\". However, during the divorce proceeding against Caroline Matilda, her daughter was never mentioned in any document, because Struensee had previously given \"satisfactory answers\" about the circumstances of her birth.\n\nShortly after Louise Augusta's birth, rumors began in the court and population that Caroline Matilda and Struensee wanted to imprison the King and declare the Queen regent; these accusations in fact were absurd in themselves, as Christian VII was more a protection than an obstacle to the lovers. By the end of 1771 the lovers began to worry, and Caroline Matilda suspected that the Dowager Queen Juliana Maria planned a plot against her and Struensee. In October, Struensee thought it necessary to abolish freedom of the press, which was one of his major reforms. According to legend, Struensee rushed to the Queen's feet, begging her to let him leave the country for both their sakes, but Caroline Matilda refused to let him go. At the same time he confessed to one of his friends it was only thanks to the support of the Queen that he retained his post. On 30 November the court moved to Frederiksberg Palace, where security measures had been increased by orders of Struensee. Then the order to disband the Royal Guard caused a military march to Fredericksberg on Christmas Eve, and the court became clear about the real mood of the people. At the same time, there were rumors that the British diplomat Robert Murray Keith proposed to give Struensee a large sum of money if he were to leave the country, but there is no documentary evidence for this.\n\nThe court returned to Copenhagen on 8 January 1772. By this time, Struensee and Caroline Matilda were already in serious danger. In early January, a former supporter of Struensee, Count Schack Carl Rantzau, discontented with the fact that Struensee did not accept his political views, decided to overthrow the favorite. Dowager Queen Juliana Maria had during the summer watched the progress of events from Fredensborg Palace, where she lived in seclusion with her son. Rantzau gave her fake evidence that the lovers were going to overthrow the King, prompting the Dowager Queen to act against them. Details of the case were specified on 15 January at the Dowager's residence, and the execution of their conspiracy was scheduled for the night of 16–17 January, after the end of a masked ball at the \"Hofteatret\" in Christiansborg Palace. Although Rantzau hesitated at the last moment, everything went according to plan: at the agreed time, Struensee, Brandt, and their followers were arrested.\n\nOn the same night Caroline Matilda was captured by Rantzau who, with cynical cruelty, hastily escorted her with her daughter to Kronborg Castle, in Helsingør, where they remained imprisoned under close surveillance by guards. She was only accompanied by the maid-of-honor Frederikke Louise Møsting, who was not sympathetic toward her and who had been ordered by Rantzau to accompany her. As the Queen later told the court, on the evening of 17 January she saw from the windows of her chamber the festive illuminations made in honor of her fall in Copenhagen. Only a few friends were allowed to visit the Queen at Kronborg, where her only consolation was her daughter, because her son the Crown Prince stayed with his father. At Kronborg, she was attended by the maids-of-honor Frederikke Louise Møsting, Sofie Magdalene Sperling, Margrete Vilhelmine Schmettau, her chamberlain count Christian Frederik Holstein and courtier Karl Adolf Råben, \"who were all against her\", while her favorite maid-of-honor Charlotte Amalie Trolle had been refused permission to accompany her. The fall of Caroline Matilda was necessary to overthrow Struensee, although he had not achieved power thanks to the Queen, but because of his dominance over the King; however, the Queen was a powerful ally of his, and for this reason it was necessary to remove them at the same time.\n\nThe interrogation of Johann Friedrich Struensee began on 20 February 1772, but concerning the \"crime of familiarity\" with respect to the Queen, he admitted to nothing for three days. Later, he tried to shift much of the responsibility for the adultery onto Caroline Matilda. Struensee's main political associate and friend, Enevold Brandt, was interrogated at the same time, and reportedly admitted his knowledge of the favorite's crimes. In parallel to this, the Queen's staff were also questioned, and the testimony of her chamber staff, particularly her head chamber woman Charlotta Hedevig Matthie, her lady's maids Kristine Sofie Frederikke Bruun, Anna Charlotte Margrete Horn and Engel Marie Arensbach, and her chamber maid Anna Petersen, were particularly incriminating, as well as that of her lady-in-waiting Elisabeth von Eyben.\n\nA committee of four nobles was sent to Kronborg to interrogate the Queen; during their first visit, probably following the advice of Keith, Caroline Matilda refused to speak with them, replying that \"she doesn't recognise anyone's court other than the court of the King.\" On their later visits, she denied her relationship with Struensee in the hope of saving him. On 9 March, a confession signed by Struensee was presented to Caroline Matilda; she also signed a confession and took much of the blame on herself, hoping thus to mitigate the fate of her lover, although she is believed to have been pressed or manipulated to admit the affair by the interrogator.\n\nOn 24 March an indictment against the Queen was presented to a court consisting of thirty-five members of the nobility; on 2 April she was given a lawyer, who said that the Queen was innocent and her confession was signed under pressure, and solely to protect Struensee. The judgment was handed down on 6 April and two days later the Queen was notified: her marriage with Christian VII was dissolved, although not on dynastic or moral grounds; in addition, the name of the former Queen was banned during church services. Struensee and Brandt were sentenced to death, and were executed on 28 April. As Caroline Matilda later recalled, she intuitively knew about the death of her lover.\n\nIn Great Britain the news of the arrest of Caroline Matilda was met with great excitement. After the divorce, and following the orders of her brother King George III, Robert Murray Keith began to negotiate her release, but without success. At the same time, George III had been provided conclusive evidence against his sister, and it was reported that he was advised that she could not remain at the Danish court. After Caroline Matilda's death, it was discovered that the Danes had offered to send Struensee and his allies into exile in Aalborg in north Jutland, but the British government strongly refused to consent to this and even threatened to break diplomatic relations with Denmark and begin a military intervention. A British squadron arrived off the shores of Copenhagen, but a few hours before its arrival George III received the news that the Danish government guaranteed the freedom of the former Queen. Keith was also able to secure the return of her dowry, a pension, and Caroline Matilda's right to retain her royal title.\n\nBy May 1772 the British and Danish governments had been able to figure out where Caroline Matilda would live; at the suggestion of George III, the new residence of his \"Criminal Sister\" was to be Celle Castle, located in the Electorate of Hanover. On 3 May the former Queen, accompanied by Keith and a delegation of Danish nobles, departed from Helsingør in two frigates and a sloop; her two children, Crown Prince Frederick and Louise Augusta, remained in Copenhagen and she never saw them again. On 5 June she arrived in the district of Stade (where the Danish delegation finally left her), and was greeted in an elaborate ceremony, and the next day a reception was held in her honor. From Stade, the former Queen went to Göhrde, where she stayed for a few months before finally going to Celle. On 20 October Caroline Matilda made her solemn entry into the city, where a proper court was organised for her. Thereafter, she rarely left Celle, with only a few visits to Hanover.\n\nIn Celle, Caroline Matilda led a very quiet life. Here she was finally reunited with her beloved former \"hofmesterinde\" Countess Louise von Plessen. The former Queen was visited by many relatives and friends, among them her older sister Augusta, Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, which many contemporaries considered a way to keep her watched. Her main entertainment was a small theater, built especially for her in the castle, as well a library with numerous books in German and English; in addition, she became known for her charity toward poor children and orphans. Keith, who visited Caroline Mathilde in November 1772, later reported to Lord Suffolk that he had found her in a contented mood and that she did not want to have any relations with the Danish court except those that directly affected the well-being of her children.\n\nAlthough no longer Queen, Caroline Matilda still played an important role in Danish politics, because she was the mother of the future King. In September 1774 she was visited by the traveler and adventurer Nathaniel Wraxall; during this visit he collected a lot of information about her life in Denmark that later formed the basis of his memoirs. He returned in October as a secret agent for a group of restive Danish nobles. Some were exiled in Hamburg for their support for the former Queen (notably Baron Frederik Ludvig Ernst Bülow (spouse of Anna Sofie Bülow), and Count Ernst von Schimmelmann (son of Caroline von Schimmelmann) and one remained in Copenhagen. They were eager for a change: the return of Caroline Matilda as Regent and Guardian of the Crown Prince. Caroline Matilda was ready to act, but only with the consent of her brother George III; she also feared for the lives of her children. George III was ready to support his sister and the plot, but on the condition that first, the conspirators had to gain enough power in Denmark. Wraxall visited the former Queen three more times in Celle and discussed with her the details of the plot; then he went to London, to discuss the plan with George III. With him, Caroline Matilda sent a letter to her brother, in which she asked for his approval for the conspiracy, which she referred to as \"this scheme for my son's happiness\". However, while waiting for an audience with the King in London, Wraxall learned of Caroline Matilda's death.\n\nCaroline Matilda died suddenly of scarlet fever on 10 May 1775. On her deathbed, she wrote a letter to her brother in which she proclaimed her innocence. She was buried in the crypt of the Stadtkirche St. Marien near her paternal great-grandmother Sophia Dorothea of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who was also divorced and exiled.\n\nGreat Denmark Street in Dublin is believed to have been named in her honour in the year of her death.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After his mother pulled him from the school on cost grounds he later worked as a writer, insurance broker and company secretary. He joined the Royal Navy during World War II as an ordinary seaman, was commissioned in 1942 and promoted to lieutenant-commander in 1944. He served on . Robinson's education was remarkable in that he received no further education after the age of 15 and was entirely self-taught.\n\nRobinson was a St Pancras borough councillor 1945–1949. He was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for St. Pancras North in a by-election in 1949. He was a government assistant whip from 1950 until 1951. He joined the cabinet and was made a Privy Counsellor in 1964. Reforms he oversaw include the banning on cigarette television advertising and the reintroduction of prescription charges. When his position of Minister of Health was abolished in 1968, Robinson was appointed Minister for Planning and Land, only for this position to be abolished a year later. Robinson left Parliament in 1970.\n\nRobinson was probably one of the UK's most respected Health Ministers. He was always willing to listen, and indeed took informal advice from his local GPs during difficult negotiations over the GP Charter in 1965. John Horder stated of Robinson's role as Minister of Health: \"Kenneth brought to this crisis a mind that was well prepared and the calmness, consideration and personality which we all have known.\" Robinson noticed problems with Britain's approach to General Practice Medicine, and quickly sought to reach agreement with practitioners and change the organization, funding, and nature of practice in the system. Robinson published the first consultative document on reorganisation and the need for administrative reform of the National Health System. One compromise he instituted was to reduce the number of hospital beds, under an argument of current under-utilization, and in agreement with the medical profession. In return, the government lifted the limits on fees that medical consultants could charge to patients. These actions helped to form the basis for the \"1966 General Practitioner's Charter\", which Robinson negotiated with Dr. James Cameron, the General Medical Services Committee chairman. Robinson also placed emphasis on nursing, appointing Sir Brian Salmon to a special committee of management experts and nurses, which looked into ways to advise and prepare senior staff at hospitals for their posts.\n\nRobinson had served as the first chairman of the National Association of Mental Health (now known as Mind). His interest in mental health issues brought him into conflict with the Church of Scientology, considered to hold controversial views on mental health: as Minister, he told the House of Commons that he was satisfied that \"Scientology is socially harmful\". Robinson stated that there was a \"grave concern\" among local government at the time about Scientology, and its potential effects on the town of East Grinstead. Robinson stated in 1968 in the House of Commons that Scientology was: \"a pseudo-philosophical cult\". \"Time Magazine\" also quoted Robinson as stating: that the Church of Scientology was: \"socially harmful ... a potential menace to the personality\" and \"a serious danger to health.\" In this speech, Robinson referred to the \"Anderson Report\", cited additional evidence of why the group should be considered a cult, and stated that there was evidence children were being indoctrinated. Robinson announced that a series of measures would be undertaken against Scientology in Britain.\n\nIn 1968, the Church of Scientology started publishing articles that were of defamatory nature toward Robinson. Eventually Robinson sued the Church of Scientology of California and L. Ron Hubbard for libel. The case appeared before Justice Ackner, and was entitled: \"Robinson v Church of Scientology of California and Others\". This resulted in a settlement between the parties on June 1973, where the Church of Scientology acknowledged that there was no truth to the published allegations, and offered its apologies to Robinson along with a \"substantial sum to mark the gravity of the libels\".\n\nRobinson supported reform of the laws governing suicide in England and Wales (which was a criminal offence at the time) and in 1958 tabled a motion in the House of Commons. Despite opposition from the Conservative Home Secretary of the day, Rab Butler, Robinson's motion attracted the support of over 150 fellow MP's within days. However, Robinson's views on the subject were much more in tune with the changing times and he was supported in his campaign by such diverse bodies as the Church of England, the Magistrates' Association and the British Medical Association. Even the respected Times newspaper ran an editorial in 1958 which proclaimed \"Attempted suicide seems to have become punishable in England almost by accident,\" when it noted suicide was not a criminal offence in Scotland. The law regarding suicide as a criminal offence in England and Wales was repealed in 1961 and Robinson's contribution to remove the stigma of suicide from the statute books cannot be overestimated.\nHe was also campaigner for homosexual law reform and a member of the Homosexual Law Reform Society's executive committee. In June 1960, he introduced the first full-scale Commons debate on the Wolfenden Report's proposals to end the law which criminalised consenting sex between men in private. He had also put forward a bill in 1961 to legalise abortion. His bill failed but Robinson was Minister of Health in 1967 when the Abortion Act 1967 came into force. In 1967, Robinson announced the British government's intentions to limit forms of promotional advertising for cigarettes, and cigarette-coupon schemes. Hilton described him as \"a persistent Labour critic of the tobacco industry\". Robinson helped to put forth the 1968 Health Services and Public Health Act, which made home help service for the elderly a mandate to the government, rather than a permissive duty. Robinson was supportive of voluntary hospitals and health services, and voiced his encouragement to these institutions in a speech to the National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends.\n\nHe later joined the SDP.\n\nRobinson served as Chairman of English National Opera from 1972 to 1977, of the Greater London Council's London Transport Executive from 1975 to 1978, and of the Arts Council of Great Britain from 1977 to 1982.\n\nHe was knighted in April 1983 for services to the Arts.\n\nRobinson died in London on 16 February 1996.\n\nRobinson wrote a biography of Wilkie Collins (1951), and a young person's guide to Parliament, \"Look At Parliament\" (1962).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1997989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1997989", "title": "Crystal twinning", "text": "Crystal twinning\n\nCrystal twinning occurs when two separate crystals share some of the same crystal lattice points in a symmetrical manner. The result is an intergrowth of two separate crystals in a variety of specific configurations. The surface along which the lattice points are shared in twinned crystals is called a composition surface or twin plane. \n\nCrystallographers classify twinned crystals by a number of twin laws. These twin laws are specific to the crystal system. The type of twinning can be a diagnostic tool in mineral identification. Twinning is an important mechanism for permanent shape changes in a crystal.\n\nTwinning can often be a problem in X-ray crystallography, as a twinned crystal does not produce a simple diffraction pattern.\n\nTwin laws are either defined by their twin planes (i.e. {hkl}) or the direction of the twin axes (i.e. [hkl]). If the twin law can be defined by a simple planar composition surface, the twin plane is always parallel to a possible crystal face and never parallel to an existing plane of symmetry (remember that twinning adds symmetry).\n\nIf the twin law is a rotation axis, the composition surface will be irregular, the twin axis will be perpendicular to a lattice plane, but will never be an even-fold rotation axis of the existing symmetry. For example, twinning cannot occur on a new 2 fold axis that is parallel to an existing 4-fold axis.\n\nIn the isometric system, the most common types of twins are the Spinel Law (twin plane, parallel to an octahedron), [111] where the twin axis is perpendicular to an octahedral face, and the Iron Cross [001] which is the interpenetration of two pyritohedrons a subtype of dodecahedron.\n\nIn the hexagonal system, calcite shows the contact twin laws {0001} and {0112}. Quartz shows the Brazil Law {1120}, and Dauphiné Law [0001] which are penetration twins caused by transformation and Japan Law {1122} which is often caused by accidents during growth.\n\nIn the tetragonal system, cyclical contact twins are the most commonly observed type of twin, such as in rutile titanium dioxide and cassiterite tin oxide. \n\nIn the orthorhombic system, crystals usually twin on planes parallel to the prism face, where the most common is a {110} twin which produces cyclical twins, such as in aragonite, chrysoberyl, and cerussite.\n\nIn the monoclinic system, twin occur most often on the planes {100} and {001} by the Manebach Law {001}, Carlsbad Law [001], Braveno Law {021} in orthoclase, and the Swallow Tail Twins {001} in gypsum.\n\nIn the triclinic system, the most commonly twinned crystals are the feldspar minerals plagioclase and microcline. These minerals show the Albite and Pericline Laws.\n\nSimple twinned crystals may be contact twins or penetration twins. \"Contact twins\" share a single composition surface often appearing as mirror images across the boundary. Plagioclase, quartz, gypsum, and spinel often exhibit contact twinning. \"Merohedral twinning\" occurs when the lattices of the contact twins superimpose in three dimensions, such as by relative rotation of one twin from the other. An example is metazeunerite. In \"penetration twins\" the individual crystals have the appearance of \"passing through\" each other in a symmetrical manner. Orthoclase, staurolite, pyrite, and fluorite often show penetration twinning.\nIf several twin crystal parts are aligned by the same twin law they are referred to as \"multiple\" or \"repeated twins\". If these multiple twins are aligned in parallel they are called \"polysynthetic twins\". When the multiple twins are not parallel they are \"cyclic twins\". Albite, calcite, and pyrite often show polysynthetic twinning. Closely spaced polysynthetic twinning is often observed as striations or fine parallel lines on the crystal face. Rutile, aragonite, cerussite, and chrysoberyl often exhibit cyclic twinning, typically in a radiating pattern.\nBut in general, based on the relationship between the twin axis and twin plane, there are 3 types of twinning:\n\nThere are three modes of formation of twinned crystals. \"Growth twins\" are the result of an interruption or change in the lattice during formation or growth due to a possible deformation from a larger substituting ion. \"Annealing\" or \"transformation twins\" are the result of a change in crystal system during cooling as one \"form\" becomes unstable and the crystal structure must re-organize or \"transform\" into another more stable form. \"Deformation\" or \"gliding twins\" are the result of stress on the crystal after the crystal has formed. If a metal with face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, like Al, Cu, Ag, Au, etc., is subjected to stress, it will experience twinning. The formation and migration of twin boundaries is partly responsible for ductility and malleability of fcc metals.\n\nDeformation twinning is a common result of regional metamorphism. Crystal twinning is also used as an indicator of force direction in mountain building processes in orogeny research.\n\nCrystals that grow adjacent to each other may be aligned to resemble twinning. This \"parallel growth\" simply reduces system energy and is not twinning.\n\nTwinning can occur by cooperative displacement of atoms along the face of the twin boundary. This displacement of a large quantity of atoms simultaneously requires significant energy to perform. Therefore, the theoretical stress required to form a twin is quite high. It is believed that twinning is associated with dislocation motion on a coordinated scale, in contrast to slip, which is caused by independent glide at several locations in the crystal.\n\nTwinning and slip are competitive mechanisms for crystal deformation. Each mechanism is dominant in certain crystal systems and under certain conditions. In fcc metals, slip is almost always dominant because the stress required is far less than twinning stress.\n\nCompared to slip, twinning produces a deformation pattern that is more heterogeneous in nature. This deformation produces a local gradient across the material and near intersections between twins and grain boundaries. The deformation gradient can lead to fracture along the boundaries, particularly in bcc transition metals at low temperatures.\n\nThe conditions of crystal formation in solution have an effect on the type and density of dislocations in the crystal. It frequently happens that the crystal is oriented so that there will a more rapid deposition of material on one part than on another; for instance, if the crystal be attached to some other solid it cannot grow in that direction. If the crystal is freely suspended in the solution and material for growth is supplied at the same rate on all sides does an equably developed form result.\n\nTwin boundaries occur when two crystals of the same type intergrow so that only a slight misorientation exists between them. It is a highly symmetrical interface, often with one crystal the mirror image of the other; also, atoms are shared by the two crystals at regular intervals. This is also a much lower-energy interface than the grain boundaries that form when crystals of arbitrary orientation grow together. Twin boundaries may also display a higher degree of symmetry than the single crystal. These twins are called \"mimetic\" or \"pseudo-symmetric\" twins.\n\nTwin boundaries are partly responsible for shock hardening and for many of the changes that occur in cold work of metals with limited slip systems or at very low temperatures. They also occur due to martensitic transformations: the motion of twin boundaries is responsible for the pseudoelastic and shape-memory behavior of nitinol, and their presence is partly responsible for the hardness due to quenching of steel. In certain types of high strength steels, very fine deformation twins act as primary obstacles against dislocation motion. These steels are referred to as 'TWIP' steels, where TWIP stands for \"twinning-induced plasticity\".\n\nOf the three common crystalline structures bcc, fcc, and hcp, the hcp structure is the most likely to form deformation twins when strained, because they rarely have a sufficient number of slip systems for an arbitrary shape change. High strain rates, low stacking-fault energy and low temperatures facilitate deformation twinning.\n\n\n\n"}

Surfside is part of the city of Seal Beach, California and is located on the west side of Pacific Coast Highway, southwest of the Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach between the station and the Huntington Beach community of Sunset Beach. It is also near the Huntington Beach community of Huntington Harbour. The southern entrance to the Surfside Colony is easy to spot by the water tower (which was built into a house) that can be seen from Pacific Coast Highway.\n\nThe Surfside Colony is served by the Surfside Colony Community Services Tax District and the Surfside Colony Storm Water Protection Tax District. Lifeguard services are provided by the city of Seal Beach.\n\nSurfside Colony was begun in 1929 as an oceanside resort community. It was incorporated with the state of California in 1930. There were originally plans to develop both sides of Pacific Coast Highway (with D and E rows of houses on the east side), but these plans never materialized. A tunnel, which still exists though it is inaccessible, was built under Pacific Coast Highway to facilitate easy transit back and forth.\n\nDuring World War II, the U.S. Navy developed the area to the north of Surfside as an ammunition depot. A large jetty and channel were built to allow ships to dock. This development altered Surfside and its beachfront significantly. Changes in wave patterns and resulting erosion have continued to plague the community since then. Every few years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must work to replenish and rebuild the beach, dredging and refilling with millions of cubic yards of sand.\n\nOn July 4, 2008, a small plane pulling an advertising banner lost power and was forced to land in the water just off the shore of Surfside. The pilot suffered only minor injuries, and no one in the water was injured.\n\nThe colony of Surfside is located adjacent to the Pacific Ocean beach. It is said that no home in the colony is more than from the sand. Also visible from Surfside is a portion of Anaheim Bay, which is across Pacific Coast Highway and connects to Huntington Harbour.\n\nThe climate of Surfside is moderate with temperatures often hovering around . The record high for this area has been reported at , with the record low at . It is not unusual to have cool evenings with temperatures in the 50s during the summer and the low 40s in winter. There is often a brisk wind at Surfside, making it a favorite spot for kite surfers.\n\nOver the years, the winter surf has sometimes been severe, destroying homes in the colony. Especially severe storms and high tides wreaked havoc in 1952 and 1953, and again in 1963. Into the 1970s and 1980s, erosion posed problems for the community. Rock barriers, sand bags, and temporary berms have all been used to safeguard homes. In 1983, high tides flooded many of the residences in Surfside.\n\nAccording to 2010 census data, there were 456 residents of Surfside living in 187 housing units. The area of the colony is 0.1 square miles. The median age was listed as 45.3, and 89.5 percent of the population was white.\n\nSurfside has approximately 256 houses. 25% are occupied seasonally or less than full-time. Some homes have been in families for as many as four generations.\n\nThe colony has a wide variety of housing styles, which contributes to its charming and laid-back ambiance. Current housing styles include everything from small beach cottages to large three-story mansions. Many of the homes are rented out by their owners. The first homes in Surfside were small beach cottages. In 1929, these homes sold for as little as $700. In general, \"A\" Row houses are the most highly priced as they have unobstructed views of the Pacific Ocean extending all the way to Santa Catalina Island and sit directly on the beach.\n\nThe Los Alamitos Unified School District serves Surfside.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service does not deliver mail to the houses in Surfside. However, there is a full-service post office inside of the colony. Each house has a post office box there.\n\nSurfside consists of three rows of houses, called the A, B, and C rows. The A row is on the sand; the C row is adjacent Pacific Coast Highway. There is a short road entering the colony from Pacific Coast Highway called Phillips Street. House addresses are designated by a letter and a number. For example, \"1 A\" is the first house on the sand at the southern end of the colony. This sometimes creates a confusion when a physical street address is required.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service lists their address within the colony as 89 B Surfside Avenue. A and B row homes have a Surfside Avenue address. C row homes have a Pacific Avenue address. Pacific is the street that runs from the southeast exit of the colony through neighboring Sunset Beach.\n\nBradley Nowell lived in this gated community while being a successful lead singer for the reggae rock and punk band Sublime. After his death in 1996, he was cremated and his ashes were spread over the water.\n"}

He was on a boat heading towards Dar es Salaam for his new job working for Shell Oil. During this journey, he met various people and described extraordinary events such as a lion carrying a woman in his mouth.\n\nHe eventually joined the war as a squadron pilot in the Royal Air Force, flying the Tiger Moth, Gloster Gladiator, and Hawker Hurricane. He was among the last Allied pilots to withdraw from Greece during the German invasion, taking part in the air for the Battle of Athens on 20 April 1941. In one of his accounts, he described a crash in the Western Desert, which fractured his skull and brought him several other problems such as temporarily being blinded during his days in Greece. After the country fell to the Nazis, he went to the Middle East to fight Vichy French pilots after staying for a brief time in Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nIn \"Storyteller: The Authorized Biography of Roald Dahl\" (2010), Donald Sturrock claimed that there are disparities to the author's claims in the book, describing them as flights of pure fancy or compelling recreations of stories heard from others such as the accounts about exotic African animal adventures. There was also the case of his encounter with a group of Germans, which he had orders to round up. Dahl wrote in \"Going Solo\" that its leader was killed by an African guard after thrusting a Luger pistol in his chest. In \"Lucky Break\" (1977), a story published 10 years prior, the version of this story was less dramatic with the Germans quickly giving themselves up, allowing Dahl's group to march themselves to a camp in Dar es Salaam without much difficulty. \n"}

{"id": "1998007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998007", "title": "The Great Transformation (book)", "text": "The Great Transformation (book)\n\nThe Great Transformation is a book by Karl Polanyi, a Hungarian-American political economist. First published in 1944 by Farrar & Rinehart, it deals with the social and political upheavals that took place in England during the rise of the market economy. Polanyi contends that the modern market economy and the modern nation-state should be understood not as discrete elements but as the single human invention he calls the \"Market Society\".\n\nA distinguishing characteristic of the \"Market Society\" is that humanity's economic mentalities have been changed. Prior to the great transformation, people based their economies on reciprocity and redistribution across personal and communal relationships. As a consequence of industrialization and increasing state influence, competitive markets were created that undermined these previous social tendencies, replacing them with formal institutions that aimed to promote a self-regulating market economy. The expansion of capitalist institutions with an economically liberal mindset not only changed laws but also fundamentally altered humankind's economic relations; prior to the great transformation, markets played a very minor role in human affairs and were not even capable of setting prices because of their diminutive size. It was only after industrialization and the onset of greater state control over newly created market institutions that the myth of human nature's propensity toward rational free trade became widespread. However, Polanyi asserts instead that \"man's economy, as a rule, is submerged in his social relationships,\" and he therefore proposes an alternative ethnographic economic approach called \"substantivism\", in opposition to \"formalism\", both terms coined by Polanyi.\n\nPolanyi argued that the development of the modern state went hand in hand with the development of modern market economies and that these two changes were inextricably linked in history. Essential to the change from a premodern economy to a market economy was the altering of human economic mentalities away from their grounding in local social relationships and institutions, and into transactions idealized as \"rational\" and set apart from their previous social context. Prior to the great transformation, markets had a very limited role in society and were confined almost entirely to long distance trade. As Polanyi wrote, \"the same bias which made Adam Smith's generation view primeval man as bent on barter and truck induced their successors to disavow all interest in early man, as he was now known not to have indulged in those laudable passions.\"\n\nThe great transformation was begun by the powerful modern state, which was needed to push changes in social structure, and in what aspects of human nature were amplified and encouraged, which allowed for a competitive capitalist economy to emerge. For Polanyi, these changes implied the destruction of the basic social order that had reigned throughout pre-modern history. Central to the change was that factors of production, such as land and labor, would now be sold on the market at market-determined prices instead of allocated according to tradition, redistribution, or reciprocity. He emphasized the greatness of the transformation because it was both a change of human institutions and human nature.\n\nHis empirical case in large part relied upon analysis of the Speenhamland laws, which he saw not only as the last attempt of the squirearchy to preserve the traditional system of production and social order but also a self-defensive measure on the part of society that mitigated the disruption of the most violent period of economic change. Polanyi also remarks that the pre-modern economies of China, the Incan Empire, the Indian Empires, Babylon, Greece, and the various kingdoms of Africa operated on principles of reciprocity and redistribution with a very limited role for markets, especially in settling prices or allocating the factors of production. The book also presented his belief that market society is unsustainable because it is fatally destructive to human nature and the natural contexts it inhabits.\n\nPolanyi attempted to turn the tables on the orthodox liberal account of the rise of capitalism by arguing that “laissez-faire was planned”, whereas social protectionism was a spontaneous reaction to the social dislocation imposed by an unrestrained free market. He argues that the construction of a \"self-regulating\" market necessitates the separation of society into economic and political realms. Polanyi does not deny that the self-regulating market has brought \"unheard of material wealth\", but he suggests that this is too narrow a focus. The market, once it considers land, labor and money as fictitious commodities, and including them \"means to subordinate the substance of society itself to the laws of the market.\"\n\nThis, he argues, results in massive social dislocation, and spontaneous moves by society to protect itself. In effect, Polanyi argues that once the free market attempts to separate itself from the fabric of society, social protectionism is society's natural response, which he calls the \"double movement.\" Polanyi did not see economics as a subject closed off from other fields of enquiry, indeed he saw economic and social problems as inherently linked. He ended his work with a prediction of a socialist society, noting, \"after a century of blind 'improvement', man is restoring his 'habitation.'\"\n\nBased on Bronislaw Malinowski's ethnological work on the Kula ring exchange in the Trobriand Islands, Polanyi makes the distinction between markets as an auxiliary tool for ease of exchange of goods and market societies. Market societies are those where markets are the paramount institution for the exchange of goods through price mechanisms. Polanyi argues that there are three general types of economic systems that existed before the rise of a society based on a free market economy: redistributive, reciprocity and householding.\n\n\nThese three forms were not mutually exclusive, nor were they mutually exclusive of markets for the exchange of goods. The main distinction is that these three forms of economic organization were based around the social aspects of the society they operated in and were explicitly tied to do those social relationships. Polanyi argued that these economic forms depended on the social principles of centricity, symmetry, and autarky (self-sufficiency). Markets existed as an auxiliary avenue for the exchange of goods that were otherwise not obtainable.\n\nThe sociologists Fred L. Block and Margaret Somers argue that Karl Polanyi's analysis could help explain why the resurgence of free market ideas has resulted in \"such manifest failures as persistent unemployment, widening inequality, and the severe financial crises that have stressed Western economies over the past forty years.\" They suggest that \"the ideology that free markets can replace government is just as utopian and dangerous\" as the idea that Communism will result in the withering away of the state.\n\nIn \"Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams\", anthropologist David Graeber offers compliments to Polanyi's text and theories. Graeber attacks formalists and substantivists alike, \"those who start by looking at society as a whole are left, like the Substantivists, trying to explain how people are motivated to reproduce society; those who start by looking at individual desires, like the formalists, unable to explain why people chose to maximize some things and not others (or otherwise to account for questions of meaning).\" While appreciative of Polanyi's attack on Formalism, Graeber attempts to move beyond ethnography and towards understanding how individuals find meaning in their actions, synthesizing insights of Marcel Mauss, Karl Marx, and others.\n\nIn parallel with Karl Polanyi's account of markets being made internal to society as a result of state intervention, Graeber argues the transition to credit-based markets from societies with separated \"spheres of exchange\" in gift giving was likely the accidental byproduct of state or temple bureaucracy (temple in the case of Sumer). Graeber also notes that the criminalization of debt supplemented the enclosure movements in the destruction of English communities, since credit between community members had originally reinforced communal ties prior to state intervention:\n\nEconomist Joseph Stiglitz favors Polanyi's account of market liberalization, arguing that the failures of \"Shock Therapy\" in Russia and the failures of IMF reform packages echo Polanyi's arguments. Stiglitz also summarizes the difficulties of \"market liberalization\" in that it requires unrealistic \"flexibility\" amongst the poor.\n\nRutger Bregman, writing for \"Jacobin\", criticized Polanyi's account of the Speenhamland system as reliant on several myths (increased poverty, increased population growth and increased unrest, as well as \"'the pauperization of the masses,' who 'almost lost their human shape';\" \"basic income did not introduce a floor, he contended, but a ceiling\") and the flawed Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832.\n\nBoth Bregman and Corey Robin credited Polanyi's view with Richard Nixon moving away from a proposed basic income system because Polanyi was heavily quoted in a report by Nixon's aide, Martin Anderson and then ultimately provided arguments for various reductions in the welfare state introduced by Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush..\n\n\nThe book was originally published in the United States in 1944 and then in England in\n1945 as \"The Origins of Our Time\". It was reissued by Beacon Press as a paperback in 1957 and as a 2nd edition with a foreword by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz in 2001.\n\n\n\n\n"}

For example, among NSAs are corporations, media organizations, business magnates, people's liberation movements, lobby groups, religious groups, aid agencies, and violent non-state actors such as paramilitary forces.\n\nSome common and influential classes of NSAs are listed here in alphabetical order:\n\nThe proliferation of non-state actors in the post–Cold War era has been one of the factors leading to the Cobweb Paradigm in international politics. Under this paradigm, the traditional Westphalian nation-state experiences an erosion of power and sovereignty, and non-state actors are part of the cause. Facilitated by globalization, NSAs challenge nation-state borders and sovereignty claims. MNCs are not always sympathetic to national interests, but instead are loyal to the corporation's interests. NSAs challenge the nation-state's sovereignty over internal matters through advocacy for societal issues, e.g. human rights and the environment.\n\nArmed non-state actors operate without state control and are involved in internal and trans-border conflicts. The activity of such groups in armed conflicts adds layers of complexity to traditional conflict management and resolution. These conflicts are often fought not only between non-state actors and states, but also between multiple NSA groups. Interventions in such conflicts is particularly challenging given the fact that international law and norms governing the use of force for intervention or peacekeeping purposes was primarily written in the context of the nation-state.\n\nThe term Non State Actors is widely used in development cooperation, particularly under the Cotonou Agreement between the European Union (EU) and African, Caribbean and Pacific ACP countries. The agreement uses the term to refer to a wide range of nongovernmental development actors whose participation in ACP-EU development cooperation is now formally recognized. According to Article 6, non-state actors include:\n\n\nIn practice, it means that participation is open to all kind of actors, such as community-based organisations, women's groups, human rights associations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), religious organizations, farmers' cooperatives, trade unions, universities and research institutes, the media and the private sector. Also included in this definition are informal groups such as grassroots organizations, informal private sector associations, etc. The private sector, however, is considered only insofar as it is involved in non-profit activities (e.g. private sector associations, chambers of commerce, etc.)\n\nNon-state actors can aid in opinion building in international affairs, such as the Human Rights Council. Formal international organizations may also rely on non-state actors, particularly NGOs in the form of implementing partners in the national context. An example is the contribution of COHRE (Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions), to the protection of land and property (HLP) rights in Kosovo by conceptualizing the Housing and Property Directorate (now Kosovo Property Agency) within the framework of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.\n\nNon-state actors are fundamental agents in helping to achieve both national and international development goals, such as those around climate change. Actions by non-state actors contribute significantly towards filling the greenhouse gas emissions gap left by unambitious or poorly executed national climate policies, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).\n\nAnother example that shows the importance of non-state actors in peace-building is the contribution of ICBL (International Campaign to Ban Landmines) to the international prohibition on the use of landmines. ICBL is a global network of NGOs that has operated in over 90 countries since 1992. Its primary goal is to make a world free of anti-personnel landmines. Their passionate advertising appealing for global cooperation drew Diana, Princess of Wales to become an ardent advocate. Together, they brought the issue to the United Nations General Assembly. ICBL's efforts led the international community to urge states to ratify the Ottawa Treaty (Mine Ban Treaty) in 1997, and its contribution was recognized and praised as it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in the same year.\n\n\n\n"}

If the is actually a function, it is referred to as the Hicksian demand function, or compensated demand function. The function is named after John Hicks.\n\nMathematically,\n\nwhere \"h\"(\"p\",\"u\") is the Hicksian demand function, or commodity bundle demanded, at price vector \"p\" and utility level formula_3. Here \"p\" is a vector of prices, and \"x\" is a vector of quantities demanded so that the sum of all \"p\"\"x\", is the total expense on goods \"x\".\nHicksian demand functions are often convenient for mathematical manipulation because they do not require income or wealth to be represented. Additionally, the function to be minimized is linear in the formula_4, which gives a simpler optimization problem. However, Marshallian demand functions of the form formula_5 that describe demand given prices \"p\" and income formula_6 are easier to observe directly. The two are trivially related by\n\nwhere formula_8 is the expenditure function (the function that gives the minimum wealth required to get to a given utility level), and by\n\nwhere formula_10 is the indirect utility function (which gives the utility level of having a given wealth under a fixed price regime). Their derivatives are more fundamentally related by the Slutsky equation.\n\nWhereas Marshallian demand comes from the Utility Maximization Problem, Hicksian Demand comes from the Expenditure Minimization Problem. The two problems are mathematical duals, and hence the Duality Theorem provides a method of proving the relationships described above.\n\nThe Hicksian demand function is intimately related to the expenditure function. If the consumer's utility function formula_11 is locally nonsatiated and strictly convex, then\nformula_12\n\nDownward sloping Marshallian demand curves show the effect of price changes on quantity demanded. As the price of a good rises, presumably the quantity of that good demanded will fall, holding wealth and other prices constant. However, this effect of price changes on quantities demanded is due to both the income effect and the substitution effect. The substitution effect is a change in quantity demanded due to a price change that alters the slope of the budget constraint but leaves the consumer on the same indifference curve (i.e., at the same level of utility.) By this effect, the consumer is posited to substitute toward the good that becomes comparatively less expensive. If the good in question is a \"normal good\", then the income effect from the rise in purchasing power from a price fall reinforces the substitution effect. If the good is an \"inferior good\", then the income effect will offset in some degree the substitution effect.\n\nThe Hicksian demand function is also downward sloping, but isolates the substitution effect by supposing the consumer is compensated exactly enough to purchase some bundle on the same indifference curve. Hicksian demand illustrates the consumer's new consumption basket after the price change while being compensated as to allow the consumer to be as happy as previously (to stay at the same level of utility). If the Hicksian demand function is \"steeper\" than Marshallian demand, the good is a normal good; otherwise, the good is inferior.\n\nIf the consumer's utility function formula_11 is continuous and represents a locally nonsatiated preference relation, then the Hicksian demand correspondence formula_14 satisfies the following properties:\n\ni. Homogeneity of degree zero in \"p\": For all formula_15, formula_16. This is because the same \"x\" that minimizes formula_17 also minimizes formula_18 subject to the same constraint.\n\nii. No excess demand: The constraint formula_19 holds with strict equality, formula_20. This follows from continuity of the utility function. Informally, they could simply spend less until utility was exactly formula_21.\n\n"}

The effects of water pollution may not be immediately visible because of a sewage system that helps drain off toxic substances. If those substances turn out to be persistent (e.g. persistent organic pollutant), however, they will literally be fed back to their producers via the food chain: plankton -> edible fish -> humans. In that respect, a considerable number of environmental hazards listed below are man-made (anthropogenic) hazards.\n\nHazards can be categorized in four types:\n\nChemical hazards are defined in the Globally Harmonized System and in the European Union chemical regulations. They are caused by chemical substances causing significant damage to the environment. The label is particularly applicable towards substances with aquatic toxicity. An example is zinc oxide, a common paint pigment, which is extremely toxic to aquatic life.\n\nToxicity or other hazards do not imply an environmental hazard, because elimination by sunlight (photolysis), water (hydrolysis) or organisms (biological elimination) neutralizes many reactive or poisonous substances. Persistence towards these elimination mechanisms combined with toxicity gives the substance the ability to do damage in the long term. Also, the lack of immediate human toxicity does not mean the substance is environmentally nonhazardous. For example, tanker truck-sized spills of substances such as milk can cause a lot of damage in the local aquatic ecosystems: the added biological oxygen demand causes rapid eutrophication, leading to anoxic conditions in the water body.\n\nAll hazards in this category are mainly anthropogenic although there exist a number of natural carcinogens and chemical elements like radon and lead may turn up in health-critical concentrations in the natural environment:\n\nA physical hazard is a type of occupational hazard that involves environmental hazards that can cause harm with or without contact. There are many types of physical hazards. Some of them are as follows:- \n\nBiological hazards, also known as biohazards, refer to biological substances that pose a threat to the health of living organisms, primarily that of humans. This can include medical waste or samples of a microorganism, virus or toxin (from a biological source) that can affect human health. \n\n\nPsychosocial hazards include but aren't limited to stress, violence, and other workplace stressors. Work is generally beneficial to mental health and personal wellbeing. It provides people with structure and purpose and a sense of identity.\n\nBanana"}

He is enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and is the namesake of the George Richardson Memorial Trophy. Richardson was part of a prominent business family that owned and operated a grain processing business in Kingston, Ontario. He joined the Canadian Expeditionary Forces in World War I, and died in action in Belgium.\n\nRichardson was born and raised in Kingston, and graduated from Queen's with a bachelor of science degree in 1906. He was part of the prominent local Richardson family. His grandfather, James Richardson was the founder of James Richardson & Sons. His uncle, Henry Westman Richardson, was a businessman and a Canadian senator. His sister, Agnes was the benefactor of the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. His brother, James Armstrong Richardson Sr. was a businessman, aviator, and chancellor of Queen's University. His niece, Agnes Benidickson was the first female chancellor of Queen's University. His nephews, James Armstrong Richardson was Manitoba businessman, and Canadian federal cabinet minister; and George Taylor Richardson was a Manitoba businessman, and Order of Manitoba recipient.\n\nRichardson played for the Queen's University Golden Gaels from 1903 to 1906, when the team won the Intercollegiate Hockey Union in 1903, and the Canadian Intercollegiate championship in 1904, and 1906. He was known as a gentlemanly player, and an adept goal scorer. He scored five times against Princeton and Yale when Queen's won the 1903 title. The 1906 Queen's team challenged the Ottawa Hockey Club for the Stanley Cup. Richardson played left wing for the 14th Regiment of Kingston team from 1907 to 1909. The 1908 team won the Ontario Hockey Association title, and the J. Ross Robertson Trophy, as Richardson scored seven goals in one game against Stratford. Richardson won the 1909 Allan Cup a year later. He then joined the Kingston Frontenacs as team president, when the juniors won the OHA title in 1911 and 1912. Richardson never pursued a professional hockey career, since he was wealthy enough from working in the family business.\n\nRichardson began his military career as a Lieutenant with The Princess of Wales' Own Regiment, and when World War I was declared, he joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force on September 22, 1914 at CFB Valcartier. Richardson was promoted to Captain as a result of being the sole survivor in the 2nd Battalion during the a battle near Saint-Julien in Langemark Captain Richardson bought boots and gas masks for men under his command. He was killed in action February 9, 1916, resulting from being shot three times in the hips and abdomen, in a battle near Wulverghem.

The model is one of the most significant modern theories of melodic expectation, going into great detail about how certain melodic structures arouse particular expectations.\n\nMeyer (1956) applied Gestalt psychology principles to musical expectation, resulting in his ideas about completion, closure, and his Law of Good Continuation. In 1977, Narmour's book explicated problems he had with Schenkerian analysis and sketched ideas for a new model of analysis based on musical expectation as informed by the work of Meyer. Narmour mentioned a forthcoming book, \"The Melodic Structure of Tonal Music\", but it did not appear. Much time passed without the alternative theory, but finally in 1989 Narmour published his I-R model, detailed in the 1990 and 1992 books.\n\nAs of 2007, Narmour is working on a new book, which will extend the I-R theory to the parameters of harmony and rhythm and explore potential applications to the analysis of performance.\n\nNarmour's I-R model was published in two separate books, dealing with \"basic melodic structures\" and \"melodic complexity\". Each book is quite complex; only a few key points are mentioned here. The \"Music Perception\" review by Ian Cross and the article by Schellenberg provide introductions to the theory.\n\n\"The Analysis and Cognition of Basic Melodic Structures: The Implication-Realization Model\" begins with two general claims. The first is given by \"two universal formal hypotheses\" describing what listeners expect. The process of melody perception is based on \"the realization or denial\" of these hypotheses (1990, 3):\n\n\nHere, A, B, and C are melodic items of either form, interval patterns, or pitches. A + A → A indicates that hearing two similar items yields an expectation of repetition of the item. A + B → C, on the other hand, indicates that hearing two different items yields an expected change in the implied item.\n\nThe second claim is that the \"forms\" above function to provide either closure or nonclosure. Narmour goes on to describe the five melodic archetypes of his theory:\n\n\nCentral to the discussion is the notion of registral direction (direction of motion) and size of intervals between pairs of pitches. [P] (process) refers to motion in the same registral direction combined with similar intervallic motion (two small intervals or two large intervals). [D] refers to identical intervallic motion with lateral registral direction. [R] refers to changing intervallic motion (large to smaller) with different registral directions.\n\nP, D, and R only account for cases where registral direction and intervalic motion are working in unison to satisfy the implications. When one of these two factors is denied, there are more possibilities, the five archetypal derivatives:\n\n\nEach of these 8 fundamental symbols can refer to a \"prospective or retrospective dimension\". The symbols are enclosed in parentheses like so: (VR) to indicate a \"retrospective realization\". Narmour (1990, 6) considers these symbols to be representative of cognitive structures: \"As symbological tokens, all sixteen prospective and retrospective letters purport to represent the listener's encoding of many of the basic structures of melody.\"\n\nFrom these foundations, the theory gets more detailed, and problems of style, pitch, harmony, rhythm, etc. are all discussed.\n\nSchellenberg's work has involved testing and simplifying specific implementations of the I-R model. His 1997 article gives an overview of the I-R theory that describes it in terms of five governing principles:\n\n\n\n\nThis is the melodic archetype aba or aba\\' where the second tone of a realized interval is very similar to the original pitch (within 2 semitones). This archetype describes symmetric or near-symmetric patterns such as C-G-C#. Patterns are less archetypical as they deviate more from this symmetry.\n\n\nClosure describes how listeners segment melodies based on pitch direction and interval size. Closure occurs in two cases:\n\n"}

Eventually the two settle on a high-priced male gigolo (Ray Stevenson) for Jane, who agrees to sleep with her for two thousand pounds. As neither of them has that amount of money, they conclude that Richard must rob a bank to secure the needed cash.\n\nRichard books a hotel suite for Jane and pays the gigolo five hundred pounds, promising the rest later. As Richard leaves for the bank job, the gigolo lays a very nervous Jane on the bed, but she begins panicking and decides she no longer wants to go through with it. Meanwhile, Richard likewise changes his mind, drawing his gun in the bank but then fleeing immediately, calling Jane's name. He returns to the room and drives off the unhappy gigolo.\n\nRichard and Jane are seen successfully taking a flight in Richard's flying machine, although it breaks apart on landing. The pair are then seen in bed, implying that Richard has taken Jane's virginity. Jane dies soon after, and the film ends with Richard placing a commemorative sign honoring Jane's memory on the wreckage of his flying machine.\n\n\n\"The Theory of Flight\" received mixed reception from critics and currently holds a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIt was the last film reviewed on-air by film critic Gene Siskel on \"Siskel and Ebert at the Movies\" before his death on 20 February 1999. Siskel gave the film a thumbs up, while his critic partner Roger Ebert gave the film a thumbs down.\n\n"}

The gold coronet, with diamonds set in platinum, was made for and used by Prince Charles at his investiture as Prince of Wales in 1969. Designed by the artist Louis Osman, the coronet was a gift from the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to the Prince's mother, Queen Elizabeth II. It has been described as modern but its form is traditional. The coronet is in storage along with the other Welsh regalia at St James's Palace, London.\n\nWhen the former King Edward VIII went into exile as the Duke of Windsor in 1936 following his abdication, he took with him the Coronet of George, Prince of Wales – a highly controversial act. This coronet had been specially created for King George V, when Prince of Wales, and he wore it at his father's coronation in 1902. George's son, Edward, when Prince of Wales, wore it at the coronation of his father in 1911. When Edward was invested as Prince of Wales a new coronet was designed and used. In 1969, it was judged impractical to charge the ex-king with effectively stealing the coronet, which would be returned to the United Kingdom after his death in 1972.\n\nSince the 1902 coronet was unavailable, and the Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales was judged unusable due to its age, a new coronet had to be made for the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales. He had been created Prince of Wales in 1958 but the formal investiture ceremony was held a few months before his 21st birthday. Today, the coronets of Frederick and George are part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom on display at the Tower of London.\n\nThe coronet follows the form laid down by King Charles II in 1677 by having just one arch rather than the traditional two arches or four half-arches of British monarchs' crowns to show that the Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal princes and dukes. Though based on this traditional design, the coronet has a futurist look that was popular in the 1960s, and it was created by the eccentric designer Louis Osman.\n\nIn the centre of the arch is a monde (which is actually a gold-plated ping-pong ball) engraved with the Prince of Wales's insignia by Malcolm Appleby, surmounted by a plain cross. Orbiting the monde are thirteen square diamonds set in platinum arranged as the constellation of Scorpio – the Prince of Wales's star sign. Within the 24-carat textured gold base is a purple velvet cap lined with ermine. Around the base are four crosses and four abstract fleurs-de-lis in 22-carat gold (mined in the Mawddach Valley in Merionethshire, it was the last Welsh gold held in stock by Johnson Matthey) sparsely decorated with diamonds and emeralds. The diamonds on the base are intended to represent the seven deadly sins and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. In total, the coronet has 75 diamonds and 12 emeralds – white and green being the national colours of Wales – and weighs . It measures tall and in diameter at the widest point.\n\nWhen Osman unveiled the coronet in London, he described it as \"something that is modern\".\n\nThe frame was made by electroplating gold onto the inside of an epoxy resin cast. B. J. S. Electroplating Co., a precious-metal electroformers, was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to make a fibreglass-reinforced polyester mould of a wax model of the coronet that Louis Osman had made using a wooden template. From this mould a negative epoxy resin cast was produced. B. J. S. involved Engelhard Industries to assist in the electroforming of the cast. David Mason was Head of Research at Engelhard and was assigned the task of doing the electroforming at the company's headquarters in the Forest of Dean. Until then, electroforming an object of that size had never been attempted anywhere in the world, and it was the first crown to be made in this way.\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths presented the coronet to Queen Elizabeth II for the investiture, which was held at Caernarfon Castle on 1 July 1969.\n\nCoronets of Princes of Wales have been rarely used. The Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales was never actually worn by Frederick; and the Coronet of George, Prince of Wales was only worn rarely by George, later King George V, and by Edward, later King Edward VIII. The current Prince of Wales has not worn his coronet since his investiture; the coronet was carried before him when he took his seat in the House of Lords in 1970.\n\nThe coronet was loaned to the National Museum and Gallery of Wales in Cardiff by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. It was placed into storage at St James's Palace, London in 2011.\n"}

He was a member of the Ottawa team that defended the Stanley Cup in a 1910 challenge; Roberts scored seven goals in two games in his team's victory over the Edmonton Hockey Club. He moved to Montreal in 1910 where he was consistently among the NHA's leading scorers with the Wanderers while also studying medicine at McGill University.\n\nWhile in Montreal, Roberts attended McGill University, where he studied to become a physician. Following his graduation, he settled in British Columbia to begin his medical career. Continuing his hockey career, Roberts joined the Vancouver Millionaires where he was named a PCHA all-star at left wing and led the league in scoring with 43 goals in 1916–17. He retired from hockey in 1918 following a season in Seattle before Vancouver lured him back to the game one year later. Roberts left the sport again in 1920 and his medical career ultimately took him to Oakland, California where he practiced for over 40 years. He was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1971.\n\nRoberts participated in several sports in his youth. In addition to hockey, he played lacrosse and football. Roberts focused on hockey, however, and played for several teams in his hometown of Ottawa. He was the leading scorer of the Ottawa City Hockey League in 1908–09 as a member of the Emmitts Hockey Club with 19 goals in six games.\n\nWhen he turned professional in 1909 by joining the Ottawa Hockey Club, Roberts was one of the youngest players in his league at the age of 18 years. He scored three goals with the team in a single game in the short-lived Canadian Hockey Association before Ottawa jumped to the National Hockey Association (NHA) for the remainder of the season. In nine NHA games, Roberts recorded 13 goals. Ottawa was the defending Stanley Cup champions and, during the season, were challenged for the trophy by the Alberta champion Edmonton Hockey Club in January 1910. The \"Ottawa Citizen\" described Roberts as being the star of the first game. The paper praised his defensive checking in addition to his four goals scored in an 8–4 victory. He added three goals in the second game as Ottawa retained control of the Stanley Cup by a 21–11 aggregate score.\n\nHaving enrolled at McGill University to study medicine, Roberts moved to Montreal. He continued to play hockey and lacrosse but could not play football as McGill was unable to have him certified as an amateur. Also ineligible to play collegiate hockey, he joined the Montreal Wanderers for the 1910–11 NHA season. Roberts played only four NHA games that year, but thereafter was consistently one of the league's leading scorers. Following a pair of 16-goal seasons, Roberts finished second in league scoring with 31 goals in 1913–14 and with 29 in 1914–15. He was also named a league all-star in 1914.\n\nRoberts found it difficult to both study and play hockey, but praised the support of his classmates and the faculty in helping him earn his degree. He had to complete an extra year of schooling after failing his second year, but graduated from McGill in 1916. Following an 18-goal season in 1915–16, he left Montreal to take up practice in British Columbia. Roberts continued his hockey career and joined the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He led the PCHA in scoring with 43 goals – in 23 games – and was named a league all-star on left wing. His medical career took him to Seattle and as a result, he joined the Seattle Metropolitans for the 1917–18 PCHA season. He retired in 1918 to focus on his medical career in the Howe Sound region of British Columbia, but was lured back to the PCHA by the Millionaires for the 1919–20 season. He scored 16 goals in 22 games for Vancouver before permanently retiring from hockey.\n\nRoberts was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the greatest left wings in the sport's history. His wrist shot, one of the most fearsome of the pre-1927 era, became the stuff of legend across the country, in both the PCHA and NHA. Amongst the sporting press, he was often said to have had \"the hardest and most deceptive shot in hockey\" during the 1910s.\n\nRoberts was sometimes described as being the inventor of the \"curved shot\", preceding and outmatching players such as Harry Cameron, Babe Dye and Didier Pitre. Bernie Morris, and Hall of Famers Frank Foyston and Lester Patrick all attested to the unrivalled effectiveness and dramatic trajectory of Roberts’ shot. Clint Benedict, often considered the greatest goalie of the 1893-1926 era also gave praise to Roberts’ accuracy coupled with his ability to curve the puck.\n\nRoberts was noted for being able to get his shot off at very bad angles from close in, as well as drive it in from far outside the reach and typical positional range of defenceman.\n\nNotwithstanding his shooting prowess, Roberts was also well regarded for his stamina and skating ability, as well as being an above-average defensive checker. Despite being a physical player, Roberts (like his contemporary Frank Nighbor) was noted for his gentlemanly conduct on the ice – which he may have used to protect himself from retaliation. Montreal Canadiens bench boss George Kennedy told a story of a game against the Montreal Wanderers in which Didier Pitre was being tripped and butt-ended by the rugged Wanderers winger:\n\n...\"Kennedy screamed at Pitre, ‘Are you afraid of Roberts?’\n\n'No, sure not,’ was Pitre's surprised response.\n\n‘Well, why don't you hit him back?’ Kennedy snapped.\n\n‘How can I hit back?’ Pitre asked. ‘Roberts, he is very polite, very nice. Each time I fall, he helps me get up and apologizes and says it is an accident ... can I hit a man who is apologizing to me? No, never, it is not done...’'\n\nBorn September 5, 1891, and raised in Ottawa, Roberts was the youngest of ten children; he had eight brothers and a sister. His brother Laurie was also a doctor and athlete, while another brother, Eddie, fought and died in the First World War. Roberts returned east in 1922 where he did post-graduate studies in New York. The Ottawa Senators, then of the National Hockey League, attempted to bring him out of retirement again and Cornell University sought his services as a lacrosse coach. Roberts turned down both offers and chose to retain focus on his medical career; He moved to California where he taught for a time at Stanford University Hospital. By 1925, he settled in Oakland where he practiced as an obstetrician for over 40 years. Roberts also acted as a referee at California Hockey League games. Roberts died September 2, 1966, and in 1971 was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

There were two series. The episode list identified 17 episodes, but in the final episode the presenter referred to 10 episodes in the first series and 8 in the second.\n\nAs its slogan stated, it combined trivia and the laws of cricket. It was hosted by longtime BBC cricket commentator Brian Johnston, who served as the \"umpire.\"\n\nIn each episode, the team captains Tim Rice and Willie Rushton were joined by another celebrity from showbiz or cricket. The teams are offered a choice of question for 1 or 4 runs - the single being an easier question than the boundary. The batting team receives up to six questions (or an over) before questioning turns to the other team. The questions usually revolve around trivia and unusual facts.\n\nHowever, there are ways in which a team can win back the questioning more quickly. If a team doesn't give the correct answer, the opposing team can shout 'Howzat!' and offer the correct answer to score a wicket and win the questioning. (\"Howzat\" in cricket is usually said by the bowler to the umpire to ask if the batsman's wicket was taken by the bowl.) If they challenge the answer unsuccessfully, the batting team receives 2 runs in overthrows as compensation and keeps the batting.\n\nEach team also has three bouncers, prepared earlier. They can say 'Bouncer' before the next question is asked. All the bouncers are very difficult (often estimation questions) and score six runs if successfully answered. (Six being the number of runs awarded for a boundary which doesn't hit the ground) However, a wicket is lost and the batting goes to the other team if the answer is wrong. \n\nThe winning team is the one which scores the most runs by the end of the programme (the fewer number of wickets splitting any ties).\n\nPanellists on the programme have included Stephen Fry, William Franklyn, Rachael Heyhoe-Flint, Jeremy Beadle, Paul Merton and Leslie Thomas.\n\nThe programme was written and devised by Peter Hickey and Malcolm Williamson.\n"}

{"id": "1998068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998068", "title": "Origin of the Oak Ridges Moraine", "text": "Origin of the Oak Ridges Moraine\n\nThe Oak Ridges Moraine is a geological landform that runs east-west across south central Ontario, Canada. It developed about 12,000 years ago, during the Wisconsin glaciation in North America. A complex ridge of sedimentary material, the moraine is known to have partially developed under water. The Niagara Escarpment played a key role in forming the moraine in that it acted as a dam for glacial meltwater trapped between it and two ice lobes.\n\nIn order to understand the process by which the moraine formed, it is necessary to understand the physical geography in which it currently exists (that is, its physiography), and the layers of sediments found within it (the stratigraphy of the moraine).\n\nThe Oak Ridges Moraine consists of four elevated, wedge-shaped structures; from west to east, they are:\n\n\nThese wedges are separated by narrow east to west ridges, and formed via sedimentation. The hummocky terrain, small elevated plains and narrow ridges suggest that its formation is of glacial origin.\n\nThe moraine is nearly bisected in the east; the Rice Lake wedge is isolated from the three western wedges since the moraine is absent directly south of Rice Lake.\n\nFour primary geophysical structures are intimately tied to the formative processes of the Oak Ridges Moraine:\n\n\nThe western margin of the moraine is delineated by the Niagara Escarpment, a prominent cuesta that was fundamental to the development of the moraine. The escarpment's channels provided a route for drainage of ice-marginal meltwater; the channel system was eroded into the cuesta, and along its exposed eastern facing. Meltwater drained southwest and northeast along these corridors during the formation of the Oak Ridges Moraine. The Niagara Escarpment probably controlled regional water levels throughout the formation of the moraine.\n\nThe \"Peterborough drumlin field\" is a large physiographic feature to the north of the Oak Ridges Moraine. It has a northeast to southwest orientation, and is cut by a network of deep valleys with wide, flat floors. The valleys are steep-sided, and have a branching pattern. The valley floors also exhibit inset eskers. The feature also extends south of the moraine.\n\nThe Oak Ridges Moraine consists of numerous layers of sedimentary material, for some of which the origin is unknown. The base of the moraine touches bedrock; \"it is not clear if the bedrock valley itself was sculpted by a subglacial meltwater event, or was of a preglacial fluvial origin, or was possibly a combination of both.\" (Davies and Holysh, 2004, pg 27-5) Above the bedrock are the \"Lower Sediments\" (as styled by the Geological Survey of Canada), consisting of diamict and fine-grained glaciolacustrine sediments at its base, and an upper sandy aquifer layer. (Davies and Holysh, 2004, pg 27-5). Overlaying this is a thick sequence of \"Newmarket Till\", a sandy loam sedimentary layer common in the area.\n\nEach wedge exhibits different characteristics and sedimentary patterns, thus displaying many incongruities and depositional unconformities. The Rice Lake wedge, for instance, achieves a peak of 180 m above sea level, with a 20 m layer of shallow surface Oak Ridges Moraine sediments, underlain by the \"Newmarket Till\". The other wedges, which peak at up to 335 m, have thicker and more varied surficial deposits, and the \"Newmarket Till\" lies deeper below the surface. Moreover, the sedimentary deposits are underlain by \"Halton Till\" on these wedges, which is not present in the Rice Lake wedge.\n\nThus, from top to bottom, the stratigraphy of the moraine is:\n\n\nThe most accepted theory of the development of the Oak Ridges Moraine is that proposed by Barnett et al. (1998). \"Moraine development is highlighted in four stages and evolved rapidly from a glaciofluvial-dominated core to flanking glaciolacustrine-dominated wedge sediments.\" (Barnett et al., 1998, pg 1160)\n\nThe four distinct stages of the model are:\n\n\nHowever, the process by which each of these stages occurred has not been fully investigated, and is not completely understood.\n\nDuring the Late Wisconsinan period, the central part of Ontario was under thick ice. An east-west fissure split the ice sheet at the western periphery of the Oak Ridges Moraine, creating the Simcoe ice lobe to the north, and the Ontario lobe to the south.\n\nMoreover, the ice sheet's constant retreat created fractures where it met and scoured the bedrock. These fractures allowed the development of sub-glacial rivers (adj. \"glaciofluvial\") and lakes (adj. \"glaciolacustrine\").\n\nWith constant exposure to the sun, the surface of the ice sheet continued to melt; the meltwater flowed from high points to the north- and south-east, and from the Niagara Escarpment to the west, into the cavity created by the fissure. The fast-flowing meltwater rapidly eroded the surface of the cavity, and created channels beneath the surface of the ice.\n\nThe meltwater eventually created a network of subglacial channels; many subglacial cavities also formed throughout the ice in the region. The sediment-laden meltwater travelled along these channels, increasingly depositing material in the cavities, and in the channels as the flow waned.\n\nThe channel fills along the core of the Oak Ridges Moraine are primarily coarse to fine, though the channel bases exhibit a thick sequence of coarse sediments.\n\nMoreover, analysis of eskers within the deep valleys to the north of the moraine show that they tend to broaden to form gravel sheets. Accordingly, the \"sedimentological data support the interpretation that the underfit valleys are tunnel channels eroded and filled with high-velocity. perhaps subglacial, meltwater.\" (Barnett et al., 1998, pg 1161)\n\nThe sedimentary deposits characteristic of this stage were lateral to, and overlying the deposits from the previous stage. Moreover, \"[fan] sedimentation in this stage is distal to primary sediment input sources and occurs in a large ice-controlled lake.\" (Barnett et al., 1998, pg 1162) The most prominent process throughout this stage is the transition from fan to fan delta, and hence to deltaic sedimentation patterns, with extensive deposition of fine sand and silt rhythmites.\n\nBecause of the continued erosional effects of the rapidly flowing meltwater, a passage opened on the Niagara Escarpment, creating a channel to the \"Campbellville outlet\". The opening of the outlet allowed significant water discharge from the area, causing the transition from a glaciolacustrine fan sedimentation (from the glacial lake filling the original cavity) to deltaic sedimentation. Additionally, observations demonstrate that the Uxbridge wedge, which sits at an elevation of 335 m, was produced by an ice-confined sedimentation pattern in a lake which water level was controlled by the Campbellville outlet.\n\nIn the Humber River basin, \"interbedded glaciolacustrine stratified sediments and massive to bedded diamicton\" occurs in the upper deposition layers (Barnett et al., 1998, pg 1162). Some of these were deposited ice-marginally. In the east, deposition predominantly focused along the glacial margin, for example at the Palgrave Moraine.\n"}

He played college football at Tulsa.\n\nFrerotte, who was selected to the 1997 Pro Bowl while with the Redskins, also played for the Detroit Lions, Denver Broncos, Cincinnati Bengals, Miami Dolphins, Minnesota Vikings, and St. Louis Rams.\n\nFrerotte attended Ford City High School in Ford City, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. In high school, he was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. Frerotte graduated in 1989.\n\nFrerotte is the cousin of Mitch Frerotte, an offensive lineman who played for the Buffalo Bills during the 1990s.\n\nAt the University of Tulsa, he started eight games as a redshirt freshman in 1990 after quarterback T.J. Rubley was injured, starting his first career game at Oklahoma. He finished his college career as the school's second-ranked all-time passer, behind Rubley. During his collegiate career, he threw for 5,480 yards and 32 touchdowns on 432-of-860 passing. His 2,871 passing yards as a senior were the most by a Tulsa quarterback in 28 years. As a sophomore, Frerotte also handled punting duties for the team and averaged 35.5 yards per punt.\n\nAs an undergraduate, he joined the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.\n\nFrerotte was picked in the seventh round of the draft with the 197th overall pick by the Washington Redskins; earlier in the same draft, the Redskins had selected Heath Shuler with their first-round pick (third overall). However, by the next season Frerotte was the starting quarterback due to Shuler's injuries and struggles adjusting to the professional game. Frerotte would retain the starting job until 1998.\n\nFrerotte was selected to the 1997 Pro Bowl, but sprained his neck by ramming his head into a padded cement wall during a touchdown celebration in a 7–7 tie against the New York Giants on \"ESPN Sunday Night Football\".\n\nDuring his Pro Bowl season in 1996 (actual Pro Bowl Game played in February 1997), Frerotte passed for 3,453 yards (6th best in NFL and his career high), also ranking 9th in pass completions, finishing the year completing 270 of 470 passes. Frerotte also ranked 3rd in the league in average yards per pass completion (12.3). Frerotte had led the league in that category the season before (13.8 yards per completion), his first as a steady starter (16 games, 11 starts), finishing that year with 199 completions in 396 attempts for 2,751 yards with 13 touchdowns and 13 interceptions.\n\nIn 1999, he played for the Detroit Lions, where he backed up Charlie Batch. Frerotte wound up starting for the Lions in the playoffs while Batch was out with injuries; the Lions lost in the Wild Card round to the Redskins, Frerotte's former team, 27-13.\n\nThe 1999 season statistically was one of Frerotte's best, posting a career-high 60.2% completion percentage (4th best in NFL) and an 83.6 passer rating (9th best in NFL and best of Frerotte's career when starting 6 or more games). He also finished in the NFL Top 10 for Highest Average yards Per Pass Attempt at 6.88 (9th in NFL) & Passing Yards Per Game at 235.2 (8th in NFL). Frerotte's best game of the season came vs Chicago (11/25/99) completing a career best (up to this point) 29 completions for 309 yards with 2 Touchdowns and no interceptions, a key player in a narrow 21-17 win. The following week Frerotte again played well, this time facing his former team, helping Detroit beat Washington 33-17 completing 21 of 32 passes for 280 yards with 1 Touchdown and no interceptions. Frerotte established a then career high 375 yards, completing 24 of 39 passes again with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions in a losing effort vs Arizona on 11/14/99 (Full Season Statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference.com and individual game statistics courtesy of NFL.com).\n\nIn 2000, Gus was a backup for the Denver Broncos. After Brian Griese was injured, he led the Broncos to the playoffs. The team lost in the opening round to the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens. He remained the Broncos' backup until the 2001 NFL season was over.\n\nPlaying in 10 games (6 starts) subbing for the injured Griese, Frerotte lead Denver to four wins in his six starts, finishing the season with a 59.8% completion percentage (2nd best of career in a season with 6 or more starts), passing for 1,776 yards with nine touchdowns and eight interceptions. Frerotte finished 4th in the league in Average Yards Per Pass Completion (12.9) and 10th in Average Yards Per Pass Attempt (6.88). \n\nAmong his more notable performances, Frerotte quarterbacked a wild 38-37 win over Division Rival San Diego on November 19, overcoming 4 interceptions and a lost fumble by passing for a career-high 462 yards and 5 Touchdowns. He was far more efficient in wins over New Orleans on 12/03/00 (11 completions in 16 attempts for 201 yards, 1 touchdown and 0 interceptions) and in the regular season finale vs San Francisco on 12/23/00 (18 completions in 29 attempts for 205 yards, 1 touchdown and 0 interceptions). At one stretch Denver scored at least 38 points in three consecutive games with Frerotte starting at quarterback (11/19/00 vs San Diego, 11/25/00 vs Seattle, 12/03/00 vs New Orleans). (Full season statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference.com and individual game statistics courtesy of NFL.com)\n\nHe joined the Cincinnati Bengals in 2002, winning the starting job before losing the position after three games to Jon Kitna under the soon-to-be-fired coach Dick LeBeau. His most notable play with the Bengals came against the Cleveland Browns on September 15: Frerotte, attempting to avoid a sack by Orpheus Roye, threw the ball with his left hand (Frerrotte is right-handed) and was intercepted by Browns defensive lineman and former teammate with the Washington Redskins, Kenard Lang, who returned the ball 71 yards to the Bengals 8-yard line.\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, Frerotte backed up Daunte Culpepper for the Minnesota Vikings, and served as the team's holder on field goals. He won both games as a temporary starter for the team in 2003.\n\nFrerotte earned the Miami Dolphins starting job in 2005. He started 15 games, guiding the Dolphins to a 9–6 record, throwing for 18 touchdowns and 13 interceptions, completing 52% of his passes and finished the season with a 71.9 quarterback rating.\n\nAfter, he joined the St. Louis Rams as back-up to Marc Bulger. St. Louis cut Frerotte after two seasons with the team on February 28, 2008.\n\nOn April 1, 2008, he returned to the Vikings, signing a two-year, 3.75 million dollar deal. He was Tarvaris Jackson's backup for the first two games of the year. On September 17, 2008, he was named the starter for the rest of the 2008 season by head coach Brad Childress. Frerotte led the Vikings to an 8–3 record before suffering a back injury, which reinstated Jackson as the starter.\n\nOn November 30, 2008, Frerotte tied the NFL record for the longest pass from scrimmage by throwing a 99-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian against the Chicago Bears.\n\nFrerotte had expressed interest in being the starting quarterback for the Vikings for the 2009 NFL season, but was released on February 27, 2009, after the team traded for quarterback Sage Rosenfels. The Vikings, however, would end up signing Brett Favre to be their eventual starter.\n\nBy December 2010, Frerotte was working for GAIMPlan Consulting which helps high school athletes select a college.<ref>\n"}

Boccherini, a talented cellist, composed twelve concertos for his instrument. In 1895 German cellist Friedrich Grützmacher chose this concerto to be arranged to fit the style of a Romantic virtuoso concerto, and in this form, widely heard, it bears only a tenuous resemblance to the original manuscript.\n\nThe Boccherini Ninth Cello Concerto has long been an integral part of standard cello instruction, because of creeping use of the full 4+ octave range of the cello, rather than large jumps between different finger positions.\n\nGrützmacher merged Boccherini's Ninth Cello Concerto with other Boccherini Cello Concertos. Besides the extensive cuts in the outer movements, Grützmacher decided to rid the Concerto of its original second movement, replacing it with that of the Seventh Cello Concerto (in G Major, G.480). The Fourth Cello Concerto (In C Major, G.477) makes an appearance in bars 40-46 of the first movement, and in bars 85-96 and 151-163 of the Rondo; borrowing from the respective movements. The arpeggios of the Fifth Cello Concerto's (in D Major, G478) first movement are featured in their minor form in bars 47-53 of the first movement. Grützmacher also took the liberty of writing his own cadenzas. Despite all the changes, this Concerto holds up as one of Boccherini's best known works. Pablo Casals, Pierre Fournier, Janos Starker, and Jacqueline du Pré all made recordings of this edition of the Concerto.\n\nNevertheless, Boccherini's original work is slowly beginning to resurface. Well-known cellists such as Maurice Gendron, Yo-Yo Ma, and Raphael Wallfisch have all made recordings of this long overshadowed work. Nowadays, the two works are distinguished by their origin: \"Original\" vs. \"arr. Grützmacher\".\n\n"}

Its voting system and format have changed over the years.\n\nIn , the year before its first appearance, Romania attempted to debut in the contest, but came last in the pre-qualifying round. After successfully joining the following year, poor placements followed until 2002, resulting in relegation several times. This changed with the introduction of semi-finals to the contest in 2004, after which Romania qualified for the Grand Final every year except and . In 2016, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) suspended broadcaster Televiziunea Română (TVR) from all EBU member services due to repeated non-payment of debts, which in turn disqualified its entry from participating in the contest.

A non-qualification was also achieved in when there was a pre-qualifier for all countries excluding hosts Norway. The Eurovision site does not count either year in Romania's list of appearances.

Although TVR had selected Roxen to perform \"Alcohol You\" in , the contest was cancelled due to the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China and its spread to other countries. Roxen was internally selected for nonetheless.\n\n\"Selecția Națională\" (English: \"The National Selection\"), a song contest which takes place every year in Romania, has been used to select its entry for the contest. The first edition was held in 1993, with the winner chosen by 1100 households in the country. Since then, several voting procedures have been used, often combining televoting with the votes of a jury panel. The selection of the winner either occurred during one show, or through a varying amount of semi-finals. For the first time, a part of Romania's entry was determined internally in 2020. Roxen was selected by TVR out of exclusive partner Global Records's roster, and was appointed five songs for a jury and the public to choose from.\n\nIn , Nico and Vlad won Romania's first and only Marcel Bezençon Award for \"Pe-o margine de lume\", in the Composer Award category, and Sanda received the infamous Barbara Dex Award in .

The delegation, whose size can greatly vary, includes a head of press, the contestants, songwriters, composers and backing vocalists, among others.\n\nA five-member jury panel consisting of music industry professionals is made up for every participating country for the semi-finals and Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest, ranking all entries except for their own country's contribution. The juries' votes constitute 50% of the overall result alongside televoting.\n\nFor the show's broadcast on TVR, various commentators and dual commentators have been hired throughout the years, with Leonard Miron notably having done the job on seven occasions.

Its surface was scarred at the turn of the twentieth century when it was quarried for its rock, which served to build Vancouver's first roadways.\n\nBefore European settlement, the park was an old-growth forest and a spawning ground for salmon. Grey wolves, elk and bears would frequent the area. The settler population which began in earnest in the 1870s exterminated the grey wolves, elk and bears, chopped down all the old growth forest and paved over the salmon creeks. The salmon creeks that extend from Queen Elizabeth to False Creek do still exist today, but they have been paved over and are so polluted that salmon no longer use them. In 1930, the park's floral future was somewhat revealed when the BC Tulip Association suggested the notion of transforming the quarries into sunken gardens. By the end of that decade, the site had been turned over to the Vancouver Park Board for park and recreation purposes, and was dedicated as such by King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth (the mother of Queen Elizabeth II) on their much lauded visit to Vancouver in 1939, as King and Queen of Canada. From that time, Park staff incrementally transformed the overgrown hillsides into Canada's first civic arboretum, with a generous donation from the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association. The popular quarry gardens were designed by Park Board Deputy Superintendent Bill Livingstone and were unveiled in the early 1960s.\n\nPrentice Bloedel's gift of $1.25 million funded the open reservoirs and built the country's first geodesic conservatory, which is surrounded by covered walkways, lighted fountains and a sculpture, Henry Moore's \"Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65\". The Bloedel Floral Conservatory opened on December 6, 1969 amidst much jubilation. Its enclosed tropical garden houses 500 exotic plants and flowers and more than a hundred free-flying tropical birds.\n\nThere are several other attractions in the park including: \n\nSeveral episodes of the long running TV show \"Stargate SG-1\" were filmed there.\n\nActivities at Queen Elizabeth Park include:\n\n"}

It had debuted that year along with Spain and Finland becoming, the 14th participating country. Its best result occurred in 1989 when Yugoslavia won with \"Rock Me\" by Riva. Yugoslavia participated regularly until 1992, missing only the editions between 1977 and 1980 and the one in 1985. At the 1992 contest, following the breakup of Yogoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro competed representing FR Yugoslavia. FR Yugoslavia was banned from participating in the 1993 edition due to UN sanctions and Yugoslav wars. This marked the start of a decade-long absence from the contest for the territories.\n\nIn 2002, Serbia and Montenegro sent an application to take part in the 2003 contest, however, they were unable to take part after the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) decided that too many countries would be relegated if the country took part.

On 20 March 2006, Serbia and Montenegro officially withdrew from the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The country did however participate in the final voting for the winner. The Eurovision semi-final was not broadcast in Montenegro in 2006, and so the votes from Serbia and Montenegro, were from Serbia alone.\n\nAfter the Montenegrin referendum on independence and dissolution of the state union in June 2006, both countries sent separate entries to the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. Montenegro made their debut as an independent state and sent Stevan Faddy, while Serbia sent Marija Šerifović as their debut entrant.

Festivali i Këngës, a long-standing song contest that takes place every year in Albania since 1962, is used to select the country's entrant for that year's Eurovision Song Contest. \n\nIn 2004, Albania's first entry at Eurovision, Anjeza Shahini, finished seventh in the final. This remained the country's best result in the contest until , when Rona Nishliu placed fifth.\n\nThe national broadcaster of Albania, Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH), made the country's debut at the 2004 contest in Istanbul with the song \"The Image of You\" performed by Anjeza Shahini. The country received 106 points in the grand final and finished in the seventh place remaining the country's highest placement until 2012. In 2005, due to the country's top 11 placement the previous year, the succeeding entry \"Tomorrow I Go\" by Ledina Çelo automatically qualified for the grand final and reached the sixteenth place in Kyiv. The following year, Luiz Ejlli and his entry \"Zjarr e ftohtë\" failed to qualify for the grand final in Athens simultaneously marking the first time in their participation history.\n\nThe 2007 entry was Frederik Ndoci with \"Hear My Plea\", performed at Festivali I Këngës 45 as \"Balada e gurit\" (The stone ballad). The song was performed at Eurovision in both English and Albanian. In the semi-final of the 2007 contest he received 49 points, placing 17th of 28 in his semi-final and failing to qualify for the final.\n\nThe winner of Festivali I Këngës 46 was \"Zemrën e lamë peng\" (Hearts trapped in time) by Olta Boka. However the result of the juries that selected the winner was controversial and rumours arose that the final two judges intentionally awarded high marks to Boka in order to avoid sending the runners-up, Flaka Krelani and Doruntina Disha, to the contest. Press reactions in Albania were not happy with the decision, and RTSH announced that they would investigate into alleged cheating by the final two judges to award their points. Despite this, Olta Boka's victory remained, and she sang for Albania at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, Serbia. She qualified for the final, coming 9th in a field of 19 in the second semi-final, and in the final she received 55 points, coming equal 17th in a field of 25.\n\nAlbania was the first country to select both their artist and publicly present their song for Eurovision 2009. The winner was again selected by Festivali I Këngës. The winner of Festivali I Këngës 47 was Kejsi Tola with the song \"Më merr në ëndërr\" (Take me in your dreams), which was composed by the composers of Albania's first entry Edmond Zhulali and Agim Doçi. The song was performed in English as \"Carry Me in Your Dreams\". Albania finished 7th out of 19 in the 2nd semifinal with 73 points, thus qualifying for the final. In the final, where both jury and televoting were used, Albania scored 48 points, finishing 17th in a field of 25. However, had only televoting been used Albania would have placed 11th in the contest. Conversely if only jury voting had been used Albania would have placed 23rd.\n\nThe winner of Festivali I Këngës 48 was decided on 27 December, with Juliana Pasha winning over former winner Anjeza Shahini. She represented Albania at Eurovision 2010 in Oslo with the song \"It's All about You\". The song was a typical up-tempo composition, and has been compared to Christina Aguilera's \"Keeps Gettin' Better\" and Britney Spears' \"Womanizer\". Albania came 6th in the first semi-final with 76 points, thus qualifying for the final. In the final, Juliana finished 16th with 62 points which included 12 points from Macedonia.\n\nThe Albanian participant for the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest was chosen in Festivali i Këngës 49 in December 2010. The winner of 2011's Festival of Song was Aurela Gaçe, winning for the third time after 10 years. Her song was named \"\"Kënga ime\"\" (\"My Song\") and it was translated into English with the name \"Feel the Passion\", published in 12 March 2011, during a show called \"\"Historia nis këtu\"\" (\"The story begins here\") in RTSH. Albania participated in Semi-Final 1 against 18 other countries, fighting for a place in the grand final in 14 May. However they missed out on qualification for the final for the first time in 4 years, coming 14th.\n\nAlbania competed in the 2012 competition with the song \"Suus\", which was performed by Rona Nishliu. The song got through to the final, coming in 5th place overall with 146 points. Rona Nishliu from Kosovo achieved a record result for Albania.\n\nAlbania competed in the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Identitet\" which was performed by Adrian Lulgjuraj and Bledar Sejko. This song was chosen as the winner through the Festivali i Këngës. The results depended on the jury voting only. Among the experts in the jury was the Italian Head of Delegation at the Eurovision Song Contest, Nicola Caligiore, who greeted and gave the points in English for all the viewers from the Eurovision.tv webcast.\nAlbania came 14th in the second semi-final of the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest in Malmö and did not make it into the grand final.\n\nOn 28 December 2013, Herciana Matmuja won Festivali i Këngës 52 (the 52nd national final of Albania) and was therefore chosen to represent Albania in Eurovision 2014 with her song 'Zemërimi i një nate'. In the time before Eurovision 2014 she recorded both English and Albanian versions of this song. On 16 March she released the final version of 'One Night's anger' for Eurovision 2014. Albania failed to qualify for the second year in a row.\n\nOn 28 December 2014, Elhaida Dani won Festivali i Këngës 53 with the song \"Diell\", and this represented Albania at the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. On 23 February 2015 it was announced that the songwriters had decided to withdraw the song and Dani would perform something else at Eurovision. The following day it was revealed that Dani would perform \"I'm Alive\".\n\nOn 27 December 2015 Eneda Tarifa won Festivali i Këngës 54 with her song \"Përrallë\" which meant she would represent Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. Albania was the first country to reveal both the artist and song together. It was later translated into English and called \"Fairytale\", and the music video premiered on the evening news on TVSH. Albania failed to qualify, coming only 16th out of 18 in the second semi-final.\n\nAfter failing to qualify once again in 2017 with Lindita and the song \"World\", Albania returned to the grand final in 2018 with the song \"Mall\" by Eugent Bushpepa. It finished 11th of 26 in the final receiving 184 points, giving Albania its third best result in the contest since their debut. The song fared better with the juries, coming 7th in the final respectively.\n\nIn 2019, Albania selected Jonida Maliqi to represent them with the song \"Ktheju tokës\". Albania succeeded in qualifying from the second semi-final, making it the first time Albania had qualified twice in a row since 2009 and 2010.\n\n"}
{"id": "1998142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998142", "title": "Elizabeth Dilling", "text": "Elizabeth Dilling\n\nElizabeth Eloise Kirkpatrick Dilling (April 19, 1894 – May 26, 1966) was an American writer and political activist. In 1934, she published \"The Red Network—A Who's Who and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots\", which catalogs over 1,300 suspected communists and their sympathizers. Her books and lecture tours established her as the pre-eminent female right-wing activist of the 1930s, and one of the most outspoken critics of the New Deal.\n\nDilling was the best-known leader of the World War II women's isolationist movement, a grass-roots campaign that pressured Congress to refrain from helping the Allies. She was among 28 anti-war campaigners charged with sedition in 1942; the charges were dropped in 1946. While academic studies have customarily ignored both the anti-war \"Mothers' movement\" and right-wing activist women in general, Dilling's writings secured her a lasting influence among right-wing groups.\n\nDilling was born Elizabeth Eloise Kirkpatrick on April 19, 1894, in Chicago, Illinois. Her father, Lafayette Kirkpatrick, was a surgeon of Scotch-Irish ancestry; her mother, Elizabeth Harding, was of English and French ancestry. Her father died when she was six weeks old, after which her mother added to the family income by selling real estate. Dilling's brother, Lafayette Harding Kirkpatrick, who was seven years her senior, became wealthy by the age of 23 after developing properties in Hawaii. Dilling had an Episcopalian upbringing, and attended a Catholic girls' school, Academy of Our Lady. She was highly religious, and was known to send her friends 40-page letters about the Bible. Prone to bouts of depression, she went on vacations in the US, Canada, and Europe with her mother.\n\nIn 1912, she enrolled at the University of Chicago, where she studied music and languages, intending to become an orchestral musician. She studied the harp under Walfried Singer, the Chicago Symphony's harpist. She left after three years before graduating, lonely and bitterly disillusioned. In 1918, she married Albert Dilling, an engineer studying law who attended the same Episcopalian church as Elizabeth. The couple were well off financially, thanks to Elizabeth's inherited money and Albert's job as chief engineer for the Chicago Sewerage District. They lived in Wilmette, a Chicago suburb, and had two children, Kirkpatrick in 1920, and Elizabeth Jane in 1925.\n\nThe family traveled abroad at least ten times between 1923 and 1939, experiences that focused Dilling's political outlook and served to convince her of American superiority. In 1923, they visited Britain, France and Italy. Offended by the lack of gratitude from the British for American intervention in World War I, Dilling vowed to oppose any future American involvement in European conflict. They spent a month in the Soviet Union in 1931, where local guides, who Dilling claimed were Jews, told her that communism would take over the world and showed her a map of the US in which the cities were renamed after Soviet heroes. She documented her travels in home movies, filming such scenes as bathers swimming nude in a river beneath a Moscow church. She was appalled by communism's \"atheism, sex degeneracy, broken homes [and] class hatred.\"\n\nDilling visited Germany in 1931 and, when she returned in 1938, noted a \"great improvement of conditions\". She attended Nazi Party meetings, and the German government paid her expenses. She wrote that \"The German people under Hitler are contented and happy. ... don't believe the stories you hear that this man has not done a great good for this country.\" In 1938, she toured Palestine, where she filmed what she described as Jewish immigrants ruining the country. While touring Spain, then embroiled in the Spanish Civil War, she filmed \"Red torture chambers\" and burnt-out churches, \"ruined by the Reds with the same satanic Jewish glee shown in Russia.\" She visited Japan, which she viewed as the only Christian nation in Asia, and in 1939, she returned to visit Spain, for a second time.\n\nDilling's political activism was spurred by the \"bitter opposition\" she encountered upon her return to Illinois in 1931, \"against my telling the truth about Russia ... from suburbanite 'intellectual' friends and from my own Episcopal minister.\" She began public speaking as a hobby, following her doctor's advice. Iris McCord, a Chicago radio broadcaster who taught at the Moody Bible Institute, arranged for her to address local church groups. Within a year Dilling was touring the Midwest, the Northeast and occasionally the West Coast, accompanied by her husband. She showed her home movies of the Soviet Union and made the same speech several times a week to audiences sometimes as large as several hundred, hosted by organizations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and the American Legion.\n\nIn 1932, Dilling co-founded the Paul Reveres, an anti-communist organization with headquarters in Chicago which eventually had 200 local chapters. She left in 1934, after a dispute with the co-founder Col. Edwin Marshall Hadley, and it folded soon after due to lack of interest. With McCord's encouragement, her lectures were published in a local Wilmette newspaper in 1932, and then collected in a pamphlet entitled \"Red Revolution: Do We Want It Here?\" Dilling claimed that the DAR printed and distributed thousands of copies.\nBeginning in early 1933, Dilling spent twelve to eighteen hours a day for eighteen months researching and cataloging suspected subversives. Her sources included the 1920 four-volume report of the Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Seditious Activities, and Representative Hamilton Fish's 1931 report of an anti-communist investigation. The result was \"The Red Network—A Who's Who and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots,\" hailed with irony in \"The New Republic\" as a \"handy, compact reference work\". The first half of the 352-page book was a collection of essays, mostly copied from \"Red Revolution\". The second half contained descriptions of more than 1,300 \"Reds\" (including international figures such as Albert Einstein and Chiang Kai-shek), and more than 460 organizations described as \"Communist, Radical Pacifist, Anarchist, Socialist, [or] I.W.W. controlled\".\nThe book was reprinted eight times and sold more than 16,000 copies by 1941. Thousands more were given away. It was sold in Chicago book stores and by mail order from Dilling's house. It was distributed by the KKK, the Knights of the White Camellia, the German-American Bund, and the Aryan Bookstores. Subscribers to Gerald Winrod's new journal, \"The Revealer,\" received a copy; fundamentalist preacher W. B. Riley, president of the Northwest Bible Training School, claimed he had given away hundreds of copies; and it was advertised and sold by the Moody Bible Institute. It was endorsed by officials in the DAR and the American Legion. Copies were bought by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, the New York Police Department, the Chicago Police Department, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A Los Angeles arms manufacturer bought and distributed 150 copies, and a tear gas manufacturer bought 1,500 copies, which it distributed to the Standard Oil Company, the National Guard, and hundreds of police departments.\n\nIn 1935, Dilling returned to her \"alma mater\" to accuse such people as university president Robert Maynard Hutchins, educational reformer John Dewey, activist Jane Addams, and Republican Senator William Borah of being communist sympathizers. Retail tycoon Charles R. Walgreen asked for her help to obtain a public hearing after his niece complained that professors at the university were communists. They demanded the closure of the university. The Illinois legislature convened to discuss the matter, ultimately deciding that the claims were unfounded. Dilling delivered a frenetic half-hour speech at the Illinois General Assembly, with calls from the audience to \"kill every communist\". She declared, \"It is certain that the University of Chicago is diseased with Communism and that its contagion is a menace to the community and the Nation.\"\nDilling's next book, \"The Roosevelt Red Record and Its Background,\" published two weeks before the 1936 presidential election, was less successful. Like much of her later writing, it was largely a disjointed series of quotations. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Jew Deal\" (as many including Dilling were calling the New Deal) was already a central theme of \"The Red Network,\" and it was already being debated elsewhere. Dilling later claimed that the House Un-American Activities Committee was founded largely thanks to her two books. She wrote a pamphlet attacking Borah, entitled \"Borah: \"Borer from Within\" the G.O.P.\", fearing that if he won the presidential nomination voters would be forced to choose between two communists. She distributed 5,000 copies at the Republican National Convention, and claimed credit for his defeat.\n\nIn 1938, Dilling founded the Patriotic Research Bureau, a vast archive in Chicago with a staff of \"Christian women and girls\" from the Moody Bible Institute. She began regular publication of the \"Patriotic Research Bulletin,\" a newsletter outlining her political and personal views, which she mailed free of charge to her supporters. Editions were often 25 to 30 pages long, with a youthful photograph of the author on the cover conveying a personal touch. The masthead of early issues reads: \"Patriotic Research Bureau. For the defense of Christianity and Americanism\".\n\nDilling was paid $5,000 in 1939 by industrialist Henry Ford to investigate communism at the University of Michigan. As well as distributing his antisemitic newspaper \"The Dearborn Independent\" during the 1920s, Ford was a financial supporter of dozens of antisemitic propagandists. Dilling discovered hundreds of books at the university library written by \"radicals\". Her 96-page report stated that the university was \"typical of those American colleges which have permitted Marxist-bitten, professional theorists to inoculate wholesome American youths with their collectivist propaganda.\" She reached a similar conclusion when the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce paid her to investigate UCLA, and when she investigated her children's universities, Cornell and Northwestern.\n\nIn 1940, hoping to influence the presidential election, Dilling published \"The Octopus,\" setting out her theories of Jewish Communism. The book was published under the pseudonym \"Rev. Frank Woodruff Johnson\". Avedis Derounian reported Dilling claiming that \"The Jews can never prove that I'm anti-Semitic, I'm too clever for them.\" Her husband feared that allegations of antisemitism would damage his law practice. She admitted that she was the author at her divorce trial in 1942. She explained that she wrote the book as a response to B'nai B'rith. She stated: \"It airs their dirty lying attempts to shut every Christian mouth and prevent anyone from getting a fair trial in this country\" (for which she was cited for contempt).\n\nDilling was a central figure in a mass movement of isolationist women's groups, which opposed US involvement in World War II from a \"maternalist\" perspective. The membership of these groups in 1941 was between one and six million. According to historian Kari Frederickson: \"They argued that war was the antithesis of nurturant motherhood, and that as women they had a particular stake in preventing American involvement in the European conflict. ... they intertwined their maternalist arguments with appeals that were right-wing, anti-Roosevelt, anti-British, anti-communist and anti-Semitic.\"\n\nThe movement was strongest in the Midwest, a conservative stronghold with a culture of antisemitism, which had long resented the political dominance of the East Coast. Chicago was the base of far-right activists Charles E. Coughlin, Gerald L. K. Smith and Lyrl Clark Van Hyning, as well as the America First Committee, which had 850,000 members by 1941. Dilling spoke at America First meetings, and was involved in the founding of Van Hyning's \"We the Mothers Mobilize for America\", a highly active group with 150,000 members who were tasked with infiltrating other organizations. The \"Chicago Tribune\", the newspaper with the highest circulation in the region, was strongly isolationist. It treated Dilling as a trusted expert on anti-communism and continued to support her after she was charged with sedition.\nIn early 1941, when the movement was at its height, Dilling spoke at rallies in Chicago and other cities in the Midwest, and recruited a group to coordinate her efforts to oppose Lend-Lease, the \"Mothers' Crusade to Defeat H. R. 1776\". Hundreds of these activists picketed the Capitol for two weeks in February 1941. Dilling was arrested when she led a sit-down strike with at least 25 other protesters in the corridor outside the office of 84-year-old Senator Carter Glass. After a sensational trial lasting six days, she wept as she was found guilty of disorderly conduct and fined $25. Glass called for the FBI to investigate the women's groups, and stated in \"The New York Times\" on March 7 that the women had caused \"a noisy disorder of which any self-respecting fishwife would be ashamed. I likewise believe that it would be pertinent to inquire whether they are mothers. For the sake of the race, I devoutly hope not.\" Isolationist leader Cathrine Curtis believed that the image of the Mothers' movement had been wrecked, and privately criticised Dilling's \"hoodlum\" tactics as \"communistic\" and \"un-womanly\".\n\nMany of the women's groups continued to oppose the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor, unlike their allies, the America First Committee. Dilling campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey in the 1944 presidential election, although she accused him of \"fawning at the feet of international Jewry\". Her political activity decreased as a result of her highly publicized divorce trial, beginning in February 1942, during which dozens of fist fights broke out, involving both men and women, and Dilling received three citations for contempt. The judge, Rudolph Desort, said that he feared he would suffer \"a nervous breakdown\" during the four-month trial.\n\nA grand jury, convened in 1941 to investigate fascist propaganda, called several women's leaders to testify, including Dilling, Curtis and Van Hyning. Roosevelt prevailed upon Attorney General Francis Biddle to launch a prosecution, and on July 21, 1942, Dilling and 27 other anti-war activists were indicted on two counts of conspiracy to cause insubordination of the military in peacetime and wartime. The case was the main part of a government campaign against domestic subversion, which historian Leo P. Ribuffo labelled \"The Brown Scare\". The charges and list of defendants were extended in January 1943. The charges were again extended in January 1944. The judge, Edward C. Eicher, suffered a fatal heart attack on November 29, 1944. Federal judge James M. Proctor declared a mistrial. The charges were dismissed by federal judge Bolitha Laws on November 22, 1946, after the government had failed to present any compelling new evidence of a German conspiracy. Biddle later called the proceedings \"a dreary farce\". \n\nFollowing the 1946 trial dismissal, Dilling continued to publish the \"Patriotic Research Bulletin\", and in 1954, she published \"The Plot Against Christianity\". The book \"reveals the satanic hatred of Christ and Christians responsible for their mass murder, torture and slave labour in all Iron Curtain countries – all of which are ruled by Talmudists\". After her death, it was retitled \"The Jewish Religion: Its Influence Today\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Macedonia), has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 19 times since its official debut in 1998. The country had attempted to participate in 1996, but failed to qualify from the audio-only qualifying round. The current Head of Delegation is Meri Popova.\n\nPrior to 2019, North Macedonia's best result was a 12th-place finish with Elena Risteska in . Having qualified from the semi-final round only once in ten of the previous eleven contests (2008–18), North Macedonia achieved its best result to date in , when Tamara Todevska qualified and finished in seventh place in the final after winning the jury vote.\n\nPrior declaring independence in 1991, as a constituent country of SFR Yugoslavia, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia participated in the Yugoslav pre-selection called among the other Yugoslav federal units. Also, Macedonian composers wrote songs for candidates from other parts of Yugoslavia. However, the Macedonian entries never managed to win, and the SR Macedonia was the only federal state never to send a Yugoslav entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. An exception occurred when Maja Odžaklievska won the Yugoslav competition in 1979, but she did not perform in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979 due to the Yugoslavian decision not to participate that year.\n\nAs the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia), the country submitted its first entry, \"Samo ti\" (Само ти) sung by Kaliopi, for the 1996 edition. However, the country failed to qualify through the non-broadcast pre-selection round. Its efforts to enter the contest were again hindered in 1997, when another new system was introduced where countries with the lowest average scores over the previous four years were excluded from participating. The country made its debut in 1998, with Vlado Janevski's \"Ne zori, zoro\".\n\nThe country's best result before 2019 (and the best result with its old name) was in 2006, when Elena Risteska sang \"Ninanajna\" (Нинанајна) in Athens, Greece and came 12th. It is the only country to have qualified from every semi-final from 2004 to 2007 (other countries have qualified for every final but due to them finishing in the top 10 the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-final). Despite never finishing in the top 10, their record of qualifying for every final was only broken in 2008, when the jury vote used in the semi-final chose Sweden as a finalist, despite Tamara, Vrčak and Adrian having come 10th in the televote. Since then, only in 2012 did they make the final.\n\nMacedonian Radio-Television (MRT), which broadcasts the event, has used the Skopje Fest festival to select the national entry since the country's debut, although it made several changes in the national final format, so the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012 national finals were organised outside the Skopje Festival.\n\nFor 2019, the country competed for the first time under its new name, North Macedonia. MRT selected Tamara Todevska as their act of choice, performing the song \"Proud\". The song managed to qualify through the second semifinal, and reached seventh place in the final, winning the international jury vote. This is the first top ten placement for the country, and also broke the record as the highest place ever for North Macedonia in the history of the contest.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1998158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998158", "title": "Bloedel Floral Conservatory", "text": "Bloedel Floral Conservatory\n\nThe Bloedel Floral Conservatory in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, is a conservatory and aviary located at the top of Queen Elizabeth Park.\n\nIn 1966, communities and organizations across Canada were encouraged to engage in centennial projects to celebrate the country's 100th anniversary. The projects ranged from special one-time events to local improvement projects. In Vancouver, Stuart Lefeaux, superintendent of the Vancouver Park Board and his deputy Bill Livingstone wanted to create an exciting icon that would enhance the image of the city. Their vision was to build a conservatory for exotic plants that would be both educational and a good place for families to go.\n\nBuilding a conservatory on top of Little Mountain, as it was called at the time, was a complicated project. The city had already leased the top of the mountain to the Greater Vancouver Water Board and they had built a -acre open water reservoir for the city's potable water supply. A concrete lid was constructed in 1965 to cover the reservoir, but approval was needed to build the conservatory's surrounding plaza on top of the cover. The project was not to detract from the natural beauty of the site, nor to jeopardize the quality of the potable water supply in the reservoir. Climates had to be simulated for temperate, tropical and arid areas in the botanical displays inside the conservatory, and the project was not to exceed the budget. Giving the immense concrete plaza over the reservoir an attractive garden atmosphere meant working within rigid and expensive water board restrictions.\nThese challenges were overcome, and the conservatory was constructed next to this reservoir, which remains a major source of water for the city today.\n\nPhilanthropy from extraction companies was at an all-time high during the 1960s, so Lefeux and Livingstone looked for a way to get the project funded. They approached Prentice Bloedel of the Macmillan Bloedel Lumber Company. The Bloedel Foundation put forward $1.25 million in conjunction with contributions by the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation to build the Bloedel Conservatory, the Dancing Fountains and the surrounding plaza. This gift was the largest the city of Vancouver had received to that date.\n\nThe triodetic dome frame was manufactured entirely in Ottawa and shipped 3,000 miles across the country to Queen Elizabeth Park. Once it arrived, the structural framework was erected in\njust 10 days. The entire dome and plaza took 18 months to complete. The grand opening of the conservatory took place to much fanfare on December 6, 1969 and hosted over 500,000 people in its first year of operation. Prentice and his wife Virginia, both avid art collectors, also donated the monumental bronze sculpture 'Knife Edge - Two Piece' by famed artist Henry Moore.\n\nIn November 2009, facing a large budget shortfall, the Vancouver Park Board voted in favour of closing the conservatory. The approximately $240,000 CDN annual operating budget, the need for a roof replacement and other major capital costs were cited by members of the board as reasons for the decision. The closure was to take effect on March 1, 2010, just after Vancouver had finished hosting the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. In response to the decision several groups formed in order to lobby both the board and city council.\n\nIn early January 2010, a commissioner reported that attendance numbers were up sharply in December 2009 over December 2008 now that construction projects at the adjacent reservoir on Little Mountain and along Cambie Street, which started in 2003, had been completed. By the end of January, the Friends of the Bloedel Association had helped raise $80,000, and was projecting $250,000 by the proposed March closure. In late February, the park board voted to keep the facility open and asked for proposals on running it.\n\nOn April 29, 2010, the Friends of the Bloedel Association and VanDusen Botanical Garden Association submitted a proposal to the Vancouver Park Board to run the Bloedel Conservatory as part of the VanDusen Botanical Gardens, and the conservatory remained open. At least one other proposal was received, but the joint proposal of the Friends of the Bloedel and the Association was approved by the Services and Budgets Committee of the Vancouver Park Board on July 20, 2010, and unanimously approved by the full Park Board on September 20, 2010. On May 29, 2013, the Friends of the Bloedel won the City of Vancouver Heritage Commission Award of Honour, which \"denotes an outstanding contribution to heritage conservation in the City of Vancouver and recognizes the advocacy and successful efforts to save and revitalize landmark sites\". The VanDusen Botanical Garden Association later changed their name to the Vancouver Botanical Gardens Association to reflect the additional management of Bloedel Conservatory.\n\nThe conservatory contains three habitats: tropical rainforest, subtropical rainforest, and desert. Over 200 birds of various species reside within the dome and are allowed to fly free. Also on display are an array of tropical fish. The Bloedel Floral Conservatory houses about 500 species and varieties of plants from deep jungle to desert clime, all within the dome. The conservatory is home to Bougainvilleas and Browallias, citrus and coffee trees, Eucalypti and epiphytes, Euphorbia and various figs, Gardenia and Hibiscus. Magnolia trees share space with delicate lilies, yucca with pteris (ferns).\n\nLocated above sea level, the conservatory itself is in diameter, high, and is made up of 1,490 plexiglass bubbles and 2,324 pieces of extruded aluminum tubing. There are 32 different shapes and sizes, but each bubble measures 9 inches in height. It contains 8 air circulating units and 24 mist sprayers to control temperature and humidity for 3 separate climatic zones inside the dome.\n\nThe Triodetic System was developed and patented in Canada in 1955 by F. Fentiman and Sons of Ottawa. This system was originally made from aluminum components. It uses extruded cylindrical solid aluminum hubs (nodes) with slots, and tubular aluminum or steel members with matching crimped ends. Triodetic joints resist tension, compression and combined cross loading. Triodetic domes are designed as double curved shells which allow increased structural advantages for the span:rise ratio. The use of triangles makes the structure rigid and very strong, and similar to the geodesic design, stresses are transmitted throughout the structure. Even with light structural components, triodetic domes are able to withstand extremes of wind and even earth quakes. This enables a large interior volume to be enclosed without the need for internal supporting columns.\n\nIn the plaza adjacent to the conservatory dome is a bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, \"Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65\". It was donated to the Park Board by avid modern art collector Prentice Bloedel and his wife Virginia along with the funding to build the conservatory, the surrounding plaza and fountains.\n\nMoore created this piece in 1962, and authorized three castings of the work. The first stands on Nelson Rockefeller's New York estate, the second is outside the House of Lords, in London,\nEngland, and the third is situated to the south of the conservatory next to the Dancing Fountains. Knife Edge was the first non-commemorative sculpture accepted by the Vancouver Park Board. It was donated by Prentice Bloedel and his wife Virginia to tie the conservatory dome and the design of the adjacent fountain plaza to the inspiration and power of nature.\n\nThe conservatory has been used as a filming location for several movies and science fiction series including \"G-Saviour\", \"Battlestar Galactica\", \"Stargate SG-1\", \"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda\" and \"Beyond the Black Rainbow\". Filming of a scene from episode 21, Season 3 of Supergirl also took place here.\n\n\n"}

Emile Zuckerkandl and the physical chemist Linus Carl Pauling introduced the term \"paleogenetics\" in 1963, in reference to the examination of possible applications in the reconstruction of past polypeptide sequences. The first sequence of an ancient DNA, isolated from a museum specimen of the extinct quagga, was published in 1984 by a team led by Allan Wilson.\n\nPaleogeneticists do not recreate actual organisms, but piece together ancient DNA sequences using various analytical methods. Fossils are \"the only direct witnesses of extinct species and of evolutionary events\" and finding DNA within those fossils allows for a deeper examination of these events.\n\nSimilar sequences are often found along protein polypeptide chains in different species. This similarity is directly linked to the sequence of the DNA (the genetic material of the organism). Due to the improbability of this being random chance, and its consistency too long to be attributed to convergence by natural selection, these similarities can be plausibly linked to the existence of a common ancestor with common genes. This allows polypeptide sequences to be compared between species, and the difference between two genetic sequences can be used to determine - within error - the time at which a common ancestor existed.\n\nUsing the thigh bone of a Neanderthal female, 63% of the Neanderthal genome was uncovered and 3.7 billion bases of DNA were decoded. It showed that \"Homo neanderthalensis\" was the closest living relative of \"Homo sapiens,\" until the former lineage died out 30,000 years ago. The Neanderthal genome was shown to be within the range of variation of those of anatomically modern humans, although at the far periphery of that range of variation. Paleogenetic analysis also suggests that Neanderthals shared more DNA with chimpanzees than \"homo sapiens\". It was also found that Neanderthals were less genetically diverse than modern humans are, which indicates that \"Homo neanderthalensis\" grew from a group composed of relatively few individuals. DNA sequences suggest that \"Homo sapiens\" first appeared between about 130,000 and 250,000 years ago in Africa.\n\nPaleogenetics opens up many new possibilities for the study of hominid evolution and dispersion. By analyzing the genomes of hominid remains, their lineage can be traced back to from where they came, or from where they share a common ancestor. The Denisova hominid, a species of hominid found in Siberia from which DNA was able to be extracted, may show signs of having genes that are not found in any Neanderthal nor Homo sapiens genome, possibly representing a new lineage or species of hominid.\n\nLooking at DNA can give insight into lifestyles of people of the past. Neandertal DNA shows that they lived in small temporary communities. DNA analysis can also show dietary restrictions and mutations, such as the fact that \"Homo neanderthalensis\" was lactose-intolerant.\n\nStudying DNA of the deceased also allows us to look at the medical history of the human species. By looking back we can discover when certain diseases first appeared and began to afflict humans.\n\nThe oldest case of Lyme disease was discovered in the genome on a man called Ötzi the Iceman. Ötzi died around 3,300 B.C., and his remains were discovered in the Eastern Alps in the early 1990s. An analysis of his genes was not run until 20 years later. Genetic remains of the bacterium that cause Lyme disease, \"Borrelia burgdorferi\", were discovered in genetic material from Ötzi.\n\nNot only can past humans be investigated through paleogenetics, but the organisms they had an effect on can also be examined. Through examination of the divergence found in domesticated species such as cattle and the archaeological record from their wild counterparts; the effect of domestication can be studied, which could tell us a lot about the behaviors of the cultures that domesticated them. The genetics of these animals also reveals traits not shown in the paleontological remains, such as certain clues as to the behavior, development, and maturation of these animals. The diversity in genes can also tell where the species were domesticated, and how these domesticates migrated from these locations elsewhere.\n\nAncient remains usually contain only a small fraction of the original DNA present in an organism. This is due to the degradation of DNA in dead tissue by biotic and abiotic factors once repair enzymes present in living tissue cease to be functional. DNA preservation is dependent on a number of environmental characteristics, including temperature, humidity, oxygen and sunlight. Remains from regions with high heat and humidity typically contain less intact DNA than those from permafrost or caves, where remains may persist in cold, low oxygen conditions for several hundred thousand years. In addition, DNA degrades much more quickly following excavation of materials, and freshly excavated bone has a much higher chance of containing viable genetic material. After excavation, bone may also become contaminated with modern DNA (i.e. from contact with skin or unsterilized tools), which can create false-positive results.\n\n"}

LOOP provides tanker offloading and temporary storage services for crude oil transported on some of the largest tankers in the world. Most tankers offloading at LOOP are too large for U.S. inland ports. LOOP handles 13 percent of the nation's foreign oil, about a day, and connects by pipeline to 50 percent of the U.S. refining capability.\n\nTankers offload at LOOP by pumping crude oil through hoses connected to a Single Buoy Mooring (SBM) base. Three SPMs are located 8,000 feet (2.4 km) from the Marine Terminal. The SPMs are designed to handle ships up to 700,000 deadweight tons (635,000 metric tonnes). The crude oil then moves to the Marine Terminal via a 56-inch (1.4 m) diameter submarine pipeline. The Marine Terminal consists of a control platform and a pumping platform.\n\nThe control platform is equipped with a helicopter pad, living quarters, control room, vessel traffic control station, offices and life support equipment. The pumping platform contains four 7,000-hp (5 MW) pumps, power generators, metering and laboratory facilities. Crude oil is only handled on the pumping platform where it is measured, sampled, and boosted to shore via a 48-inch (1.2 m) diameter pipeline.\n\nThe distance to shore puts LOOP outside U.S. territorial waters, and special agreements in international sea law are made to allow ships from other countries to come under U.S. jurisdiction to visit LOOP.\n\nLOOP's onshore facilities, Fourchon Booster Station and Clovelly Dome Storage Terminal, are located just on-shore in Fourchon and 25 miles (40.2 km) inland near Galliano, Louisiana. The Fourchon Booster Station has four 6,000-hp (4.5 MW) pumps which increase the pressure and crude oil flow en route to the Clovelly Dome Storage Terminal.\n\nThe Clovelly Dome Storage Terminal is used to store crude oil in underground salt domes before it is shipped to the various refineries. The terminal consists of eight caverns with a total capacity of , a pump station with four 6,000-hp pumps, meters to measure the crude oil receipts and deliveries, and a Brine Storage Reservoir. The brine reservoir is supersaturated with salts so as to prevent further degradation of the massive salt dome in which the eight caverns store the crude. This is because the supersaturated brine is much more dense than the crude oil, and as it is pumped into the caverns to push the crude to the surface and into the surface distribution systems. This results in virtually no loss of quality to the crude oil offload.\n\n\n\n"}

Deitch Projects had a gallery and project space at 76 Grand Street and 18 Wooster Street in SoHo, and previously an additional in Long Island City. \n\nFrom 1988 to 1996, Jeffrey Deitch had been a private dealer and art adviser to a number of collectors.\n\nSince opening with a performance by Vanessa Beecroft in February 1996, Deitch Projects presented nearly one hundred and eighteen solo exhibitions and projects, ten thematic exhibitions, and a number of public events. It is known as the gallery where many of the most well-known artists of the 90s and early 2000s—Cecily Brown, Inka Essenhigh, Barry McGee, Swoon and Kristin Baker to name a few—began their careers.\n\nIn 2009, artists Justin Lowe and Jonah Freeman transformed the gallery into a Gothic warren of rooms populated with gurgling beakers and melting toilets for a piece called \"Black Acid Co-op\". That same year, Deitch Projects and Goldman Properties organized the ambitious public project \"The Wynwood Walls\", for which 15 artists created 11 permanent murals throughout Miami's Wynwood district.\n\nIn addition to its projects with emerging artists, the gallery actively produced exhibitions and books with more established artists who have been part of Jeffrey Deitch's circle since the mid-1970s and early 1980s. In 2007, the gallery produced a book and exhibition on Jean-Michel Basquiat's work in the transitional year of 1981, when he went from working on street to working in the studio. The gallery also represented the estate of late artist Keith Haring, with whom Deitch worked closely in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1997 Sotheby's purchased a 50% interest in Deitch Projects. Under the two companies' agreement, besides running his galleries, Jeffrey Deitch worked at the auction house managing its 20th-century Art Gallery Program for a few years. Sotheby's later announced that it would close the previously acquired André Emmerich Gallery, and that the gallery's artists would be handled out of Deitch Projects. As a response, the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, the main beneficiary of the artists' estates, as well as the estates of Morris Louis and Milton Avery announced that they would not renew their Emmerich contracts. Sotheby's subsequently sold its share in Deitch Projects back to Jeffrey Deitch.\n\nThe gallery closed in Summer 2010 as Jeffrey Deitch went on to lead the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). After his three-year tenure at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art from 2010 to 2013, Deitch moved back to his New York spaces, renaming them Jeffrey Deitch Inc.\n\nIn 2014, Jeffrey Deitch published \"Live the Art\" on the 15-years history of Deitch Projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to performances, the civic center could host conferences and exhibits as well, with 5,800 square feet (540 m²) of meeting space. The civic center was owned and operated by the Atlanta city government’s Department of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs, but brought in enough revenue to be self-supporting.\n\nThe Atlanta Civic Center was built in 1967 on the site of Ripley Street and part of Currier Street in the Buttermilk Bottom community. It was partly built as the city's convention center, a role now largely filled by the state-run Georgia World Congress Center .

Halil Fırat from the Justice and Development Party (AKP) was elected mayor in the local elections in March 2019. The current Kaymakam is Halid Yıldız. \n\nKnown as Samosata in antiquity, . The current site of Samsat is comparatively new, however, being built only since 1989 when the old town of Samosata was flooded during construction of the Atatürk Dam. Indeed, to some extent the re-construction of the town is still ongoing A even more ancient tell nearby dating back to the paleolithic era has survived to the current day.\n\nIn 2016 the town had a population of 3789, down from 4720 in 2008 and a peak of 6.917 in 2000. Almost all of the population are Kurds.\n\n The town was a center of the Hittite kingdom in the Iron Age and was called Kummuh in that period.\n\nBy the Hellenistic Period, the Greeks and Romans knew the city as Samosata () or Samosate.\n\nThe most commonly accepted origin of the name suggests that ancient Samosata was so named in honour of Sames I, an Orontid king of Armenia and Sophene who ruled around 260 BCE. The name of the city passed on to \"Shamushat\", and \"šmīšaṭ\".\n\nThe region was conquered by Sargon in 708 BC and became a province of Assyria. \n\nControl of the region of Commagene was apparently held by the Orontid dynasty since the 3rd century BCE, who also ruled over Armenia and Sophene. These seem to have held Commagene continuously from the time of Sames I, as the later kings of Commagene of the 2nd century BCE traced their lineage back to them.\n\nIt was at Samosata that Julian II had ships made in his expedition against Shapur II, and it was a natural crossing-place in the struggle between Heraclius and Chosroes in the 7th century.\n\nSamosata was the birthplace of several renowned people from antiquities such as Lucian (\"c.\" 120-192) and Paul of Samosata (fl. 260).\n\nThe Arabs took the city from the Byzantines. Safwan bin Muattal died and is buried in Samsat. The 13th century was very hard for the town. Rüknettin Süleyman II of the Anatolian Seljuks took the town in 1203, and Samsat was looted in 1237 by the Harzemşah and was invaded by the Mongol Emperor Hülagü Khan in 1240 and later by the Dulkadiroğulları.\n\nIt was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire by Yıldırım Beyazıt in 1392 and in 1401 it is destroyed by Timur. In 1516, Yavuz Sultan Selim retook it for the Ottomans. It lost its old importance in the Ottoman administration and became the center of the sanjak.\n\nDuring the republican period, it became smaller and became a center of the parish. In 1960, Samsat was transformed into a district center and connected to the province of Adıyaman.\n\nThe city of Samsat was evacuated from the old settlement on 05.03.1988 due to the Atatürk Dam being left under the lake waters and the center was changed and moved to its present location with the law numbered 3433 dated 21.04.1988. The old town of Samsat and all its history were flooded behind the Atatürk Dam in 1989. The new town was built beside the new waterline by the Turkish government to house the displaced residents.\n\nIn the Christian martyrology, seven Christian martyrs were crucified in 297 in Samosata for refusing to perform a pagan rite in celebration of the victory of Maximian over the Sassanids: Abibus, Hipparchus, James, Lollian, Paragnus, Philotheus, and Romanus.\nSaint Daniel the Stylite was born in a village near Samosata; Saint Rabbulas, venerated on 19 February, who lived in the 6th century at Constantinople, was also a native of Samosata. A \"Notitia Episcopatuum\" of Antioch in the 6th century mentions Samosata as an autocephalous metropolis (\"Échos d'Orient\", X, 144); at the synod that reinstated Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople (the Photian Council) of 879, the See of Samosata had already been united to that of Amida (Diyarbakır). As in 586 the titular of Amida bears only this title (), it must be concluded that the union took place between the 7th and the 9th centuries. Earlier bishops included Peperius, who attended the Council of Nicaea (325); Saint Eusebius of Samosata, a great opponent of the Arians, killed by an Arian woman (c. 380), honoured on 22 June; Andrew, a vigorous opponent of Cyril of Alexandria and of the Council of Ephesus.\n\nChabot gives a list of twenty-eight Syrian Miaphysite bishops. The Syrian bishopric probably lapsed in the 12th century. Samosata is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees, but no further titular bishops have been appointed for that eastern see since the Second Vatican Council.\n\nSamsat Höyük is a tell located just north of the Samsat district of Adıyaman. \nArchaeological research on the hill of Şehremuz in Samsat has uncovered relics from the 7000 BC Paleolithic era; the 5000 BC Neolithic, 3000 BC Chalcolithic and 3000 to 1200 BC Bronze Ages. The ancient city of Ḫaḫḫum (Hittite: \"Ḫaḫḫa\") was located nearby; it is recorded as a source of gold for ancient Sumeria.\n\nThe first excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1967 under the direction of T. Goell. In fact, the settlement was known and famous before these excavations. Then, in 1977, under the Lower Euphrates Project, which was aimed at identifying and saving the archaeological settlements that will remain within the water collection area of Karakaya and Atatürk Dams. Surface surveys were conducted under the direction of Mehmet Özdoğan. In these studies, it was concluded that the settlement was permanently inhabited from the Halaf Period to the Ottoman Period. The following year, the excavations started in 1978, except for 1980, until 1987, Ankara University, Faculty of Language and History-Geography Professor. Dr. It was conducted by the team led by Nimet Özgüç. These excavations were carried out on a very wide area, including the lower city and surrounding walls.\n\nCoins belonging to the 12th - 13th centuries AD were identified during the excavations in the layers dating to the late phases of the Middle Ages. Of these Seljuk sultans I. Gıyaseddin Keyhusrev (1192-1195), Ala al-Din Keykubbad, (1219-1236), II. Gıyaseddin Keyhusrev (1236-1246), IV. Rükn el-Din The coins of Kılıç Arslan (1257-1264), as well as the coins of Saladin (1170-1193) printed in Harran, were uncovered.\n\nThe collection of glassware with cups, glasses and bowls is very rich. Other finds include oil lamps, ivory comb, fragrance bottle, terracotta lamps, bone spoons, leaf-shaped marble sconces and coins.\n\nThe walls of the Seljuk Period, built on a solid Byzantine fortress, were preserved intact. The inscription on the limestone of this fortification was studied by a master calligrapher. The landfill belonged to Diyarbekr Şah Karaaslan.\n\nThe center of the palace, which is thought to be the central courtyard, is 14,65 X 20,55 meters and it has a mosaic corner.\n\nThe skeletons of five people thrown into a 1.8 meter diameter well of the Islamic Period were found. At the bottom of the skeleton at the bottom of the skeleton, there are five gold coins and silver coins from the Abbasid Period. One of the gold coins belongs to Harunürreşid (766 - 709) and the other to Mutevekkil (822 - 861).\n\nToday the settlement is 700 meters inside the Euphrates but before inundation it was 37-40 meters above the plain level and has an area of 500 x 350 meters. The most steep slope is the eastern slope and the lowest slope is the southwest facing slope. The mound consists of a terrace and a sub-city. Samsat Höyük as an archaeological site is considered to have been destroyed due to the importance it carries in the dam lake.\n\nThe old town of Samosta below the tell was not excavated \n\nThe new Samsat district is a peninsula surrounded on the three sides by the Atatürk Dam Lake. The distance from the sea to the city center is 47km. The district is a plain that descends to the south.\n\nIn the hot summers and dry winters, while the Mediterranean climate is warm and rainy, it is similar to the South East Anatolian climate due to the low relative humidity. However, due to the Atatürk Dam Lake in recent years, the humidity has increased relatively.\n"}

It was forced to close in August 2004 due to reduced federal and state funding. All of its displays were sold or auctioned on January 15, 2005.\n\nIn 1982, Mary O'Coner and Sue Trotter, fellow Junior Leaguers and longtime neighbors in Brookwood Hills, decided to pursue a science museum for Atlanta.\n\nSciTrek was incorporated in 1982, with an initial grant from the Metropolitan Foundation. The Metropolitan Foundation is a nonprofit corporation guided by a 31-member board of directors headed by Robert W. Scherer, the Georgia Power Co. chairman and chief executive officer.\n\nWith help from the city of Atlanta, the city committed 96,000 square feet of the Atlanta Civic Center exhibition space to the Science and Technology Museum of Atlanta. The Robert W. Woodruff Foundation donated $1 million. After years of planning and fundraising SciTrek-The Science & Technology Museum of Atlanta finally opened its doors to the public on October 29, 1988.\n\nSciTrek opened with 34 staffers, 150 volunteers, and a $2.5 million annual budget. During the three-day grand opening, 11,000 visitors toured the museum. By the end of its first full fiscal year, Scitrek reported 350,000 visitors to the museum. Museum organizers projected attendance would eventually reach 1 million.\n\nIn 1991, SciTrek reported more than 750,000 visitors, most of whom were schoolchildren. In April 1997, Gwen Crider, former deputy director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, replaced Gene Brandt as president and executive director of SciTrek. In the October 2001 issue of Good Housekeeping magazine, SciTrek was named one of the country's 10 best science museums.\n\nEven after suffering a 24 percent drop-off in visitors between 1993 through 1999, SciTrek decided during the 1999 fiscal year to retire its long-standing debt of $3 million. On December 1, 2000, Lewis A. Massey, former Georgia secretary of state, took over as SciTrek president and chief executive officer.\n\nBy January 2001, SciTrek's finances were in dire condition, having lost $80,000 to $100,000 a month over the previous six months. The museum had a deficit for the previous three years, reaching $700,000 for fiscal 2000. The board extended a 90-day reprieve for SciTrek instead of closing it down immediately. By June 2001, the State of Georgia, which had provided an annual $175,000 grant to SciTrek, threw in an additional $300,000 to help keep the museum afloat. During August 2002 the following year the Georgia Assembly allocated $425,000 to SciTrek and began a capital campaign to help raise $5 million.\n\nIn January 2003, the Challenger Learning Center, a $1.7 million simulated space shuttle mission, opened to the public. In December 2003, SciTrek named technology industry executive, Scott Coleman, as president and CEO, replacing Massey, who left to join a lobbying firm. In June 2003, the Georgia Department of Education budget for the 2004 fiscal year cut funding for SciTrek by 10 percent.\n\nSciTrek housed more than 140 exhibits appealing to all age ranges. The interactive displays offered visitors the opportunity to explore and discover the marvels of the scientific world, with a special Kidscape section specially designed for the two to seven years age group. The \"\" exhibit detailed the major achievements in the history of mathematics from the twelfth century as well as explaining mathematical formulae including Kepler's laws of planetary motion and probability theory. Other exhibits focused on electricity generation in unusual ways, creating energy from magnetism, 'freezing shadows' or stepping inside a kaleidoscope.\n\nSciTrek's Challenger Learning Center is a $1.7 million, simulated NASA space shuttle mission which opened to the public in January 2003. Upon SciTrek's initial closure the Challenger Learning Center was put up for auction. Several museums and science centers expressed interest in acquiring the Challenger Learning Center for their facility. None of the entrusted facilities or museums were able to come up with the purchasing cost of $1.7 million. As a result, Challenger Learning Center, with its advanced computers and flight technology, was almost sent to the scrap yard.\n\nTurner Broadcasting System stepped in and raised the money needed to purchase SciTrek's Challenger Learning Center, which was relocated and donated to Atlanta's Fernbank Science Center. SciTrek's name, intellectual property, computers, materials from the Edison exhibit, science education curriculum and programs were transferred to Valdosta State University in 2005. The new SciTrek is closed to the public, but serves as an educational center for teachers and students in South Georgia.\n\nSTARS: SciTrek Amateur Radio Society operated W4WOW, the Amateur Radio Station located in SciTrek. STARS operated on CW, SSB, FM, and PSK-31 frequencies along with others. The frequency bands most often used by the group were HF, UHF, and VHF.\n\nWhen SciTrek was in operation, the group met on the first Sunday of every month at the ham radio Station in the Museum.\n\nIn August 2004, a charter school, call Tech High, opened inside the SciTrek Civic Center building. The school was a public-private hybrid.\n"}

Murphy was born in Morristown, New Jersey but grew up in Sparta Township. He attended the Delbarton School and the University of Notre Dame, both Roman Catholic schools. At Notre Dame, he was a two-time consensus All-American before declaring himself for the 2001 NBA Draft. He has since graduated from Columbia University.\n\nMurphy was a standout performer for the Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey and coach Dan Whalen.\n\nHis breakout year was as a sophomore when he averaged 20.5 points per game and 11.8 rebounds, earning first team all-county honors. He followed up his sophomore year with a successful junior campaign, averaging 23.5 points and 10.5 rebounds and All-State honors. His senior year would be his most successful season as he led Delbarton to a 20–6 record and the state quarterfinals.\n\nFor the season he averaged 33.0 points per game (on 56.8 percent shooting), to lead the state in scoring along with 14.8 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. At the end of the season he was named Morris County Player of the Year by the \"Newark Star-Ledger\" and the most valuable player for his team at the prestigious Capital Classic in Washington, D.C.\n\nMurphy played college basketball at the University of Notre Dame. He led the Irish in scoring and rebounding in each of his three seasons, averaging 21.8 points and 9.2 rebounds during the 2000–01 campaign. A consensus first-team All-American as a junior and sophomore, he is one of 10 Irish players to earn consensus All-American honors (which includes six players named on more than one occasion).\n\nMurphy shared Big East Conference Player of the Year honors with Troy Bell of Boston College in 2001 and joined an elite group of four players—Chris Mullin (St. John's), Patrick Ewing (Georgetown) and Richard Hamilton (Connecticut)—as the only two-time winners of the award. He was named to the John R. Wooden Award All-America Team for the second consecutive year, finished fifth in the balloting for the Wooden Award and was among the top three finalists for the Naismith player-of-the-year honor. A first-team all-Big East selection for two seasons, Murphy also was named the Big East Rookie of the Year in 1999.\n\nHe became just the fifth player in Notre Dame history to score more than 2,000 career points and finished his career fifth on the all-time scoring list with 2,011 points. Murphy is the only player to score more than 2,000 points and grab more than 900 rebounds (924) in 94 career games. He left Notre Dame with career averages of 21.4 points and 9.8 rebounds. Murphy was a starter in 93 games during his career and scored in double figures in 92 of those 94 contests.\n\nIn addition to finishing fifth on the all-time career scoring list, upon his departure from the University, he ranked second in blocked shots (126), free throws made (587) and free throws attempted (755), sixth in rebounding and field goals made (680) and ninth in field goals attempted (1,370).\n\nOn January 23, 2016, Murphy was inducted into Notre Dame's Ring of Honor.\n\nMurphy was selected 14th overall in the 2001 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors. After starting slowly, he showed promise toward the end of the season. He realized this promise in his second pro season, averaging a double-double – 11.7 pts and 10.2 boards – and finishing second in Most Improved Player voting. He also started the Rookie Challenge as the Sophomores' power forward. However, his three-point shooting that was a huge part of his college success was nearly absent, as he only attempted 14 three-pointers during the year, making five. He spent the next offseason working extensively on his outside shooting; however, he never got much of a chance to test out his new jumper in 2003–04 after a series of injuries limited him to 28 games, with no starts.\n\nHowever, he did attempt 17 threes in those games. With that part of his arsenal seemingly ready to go, Murphy spent the following offseason working on strength and conditioning as he looked to be a more well-rounded and complete player. While he had one injury scare the next season, he played in 70 games, and rediscovered his three-point shot, attempting nearly three per game. He averaged 15.4 points and 10.8 rebounds and finished 22nd in Western Conference All-Star voting that year. His numbers dropped off slightly in 2005–06 to 14.0 and 10.0 per game.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, Murphy was involved in an 8-player trade that sent him, Mike Dunleavy Jr., Ike Diogu, and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for Stephen Jackson, Al Harrington, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, and Josh Powell. During his time with the Pacers, Murphy's three-point shot improved even more. Against the Utah Jazz on March 10, 2009, Murphy made seven out of his first eight three-pointers in the first half.\n\nOn August 11, 2010, the Pacers traded Murphy to the New Jersey Nets in a four-team, five-player deal.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, the Warriors reacquired Murphy and a second round pick in exchange for Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement. He was waived in time to be playoff-eligible for a new team.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, Murphy signed with the Boston Celtics for the remainder of the 2010-11 NBA season. On April 22, 2011, Murphy played in his first career playoff game, a first-round game against the New York Knicks.\n\nOn December 17, 2011, Murphy signed with the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2011-12 NBA season. Over the season, he averaged 3.2 points in 16.2 minutes per game.\n\nOn November 2, 2012, Murphy signed with the Dallas Mavericks for the 2012–13 NBA season, replacing Eddy Curry. He was waived on November 29 when Dallas signed guard Derek Fisher.\n\nMurphy earned $66,000,000 in his NBA career. He then attended Columbia University School of General Studies, pursuing a degree in sociology. Murphy maintained a 3.8 GPA and made the dean's list, according to \"The New York Times.\" He has since graduated.\n"}

Although Poland did not become a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) until 1993, earlier contests had often been broadcast on Telewizja Polska (TVP), the Polish broadcaster.\n\nPoland's debut in the contest in remains its most successful entry, with Edyta Górniak finishing second. This remains Poland's only top five result in the contest. The country reached the top ten for the second time with Ich Troje finishing seventh in . Poland then failed to qualify from the semi-finals in six out of seven years between 2005 and 2011, before withdrawing from the contest in 2012 and 2013. Since returning in 2014, Poland had qualified for the final for four consecutive years (2014–2017), achieving a third top ten finish in , with Michał Szpak finishing eighth. Since 2018 the country failed to qualify two times in row (2018–2019)\n\nThe first ever performance by Poland was at the 1994 contest: Edyta Górniak's song was also by far the most successful for Poland to date, receiving 166 points and placing second. Poland was almost disqualified that year though; there was no free-language rule in operation at the time, and a furor erupted at the dress rehearsal when Górniak sung the second half of \"To nie ja!\" in English. Six national delegations formally petitioned for Poland to be disqualified; however Eurovision rules required a majority of delegations (13 in this case) to complain before the European Broadcasting Union could examine the case for disqualification, so Poland was allowed to remain.\n\nThe Polish entry for the 1995 contest was again selected through internally was Justyna Steczkowska with \"Sama\". Steczkowska could not replicate Górniak's 2nd place, receiving only 15 points and placing 18th.\n\nThe 1996 entry was Kasia Kowalska with \"Chcę znać swój grzech...\". It placed 15th with 31 points.\n\nPoland competed in the 1997 competition with the song \"Ale jestem\" , was the first uptempo Polish entry, which was performed by Anna Maria Jopek .At the close of voting, it had received 54 points, placing 11th in a field of 25.\nIn 1998 Poland was represented by band Sixteen they performed the song \"To Takie Proste\" in the final of the competition, finishing 17th of 25 entrants.\n\nin 1999 represented Poland with the song \"Przytul mnie mocno\",he also was the first man who represented his country. He placed 18th with 17 points.\n\nPoland returned to Eurovision following an enforced one-year absence 2002.\n\nFor the 2003 contest Poland organized its first public selection for Eurovision entry; It was no surprise when the group Ich Troje won the public vote ahead of Blue Café, placing 7th of 26 countries in the final. This placing allowed Poland to skip the semi-final of the 2004 contest, automatically qualifying for the final.\n\nThe Polish entry for the 2004 contest was again selected through National Final, the winner of Krajowe Eliminacje was Blue Café with \"Love Song\". Group could not replicate Ich Troje's 7th place, receiving only 27 points and placing 17th.\n\nIn 2005 TVP went back to an internal selection, picking \"Czarna dziewczyna\", a multilingual song performed in Polish and Russian.Poland competed first time at the semi-final. The song just missed out on a place in the final, coming 11th in the semi-final with 81 points only 4-point behind Latvia.\n\nPoland's 2006 entry with the comeback of the public vote on TVP, Ich Troje were chosen again in 2006 with song \"Follow My Heart\", but could not repeat their 7th place from 2003 failed to qualify for the final, coming 11th with 70 points in the semi-final only 5-point behind Macedonia. Poland's 2007 entry, \"Time To Party\", sung by The Jet Set, only finished 14th in the semi-final.\n\nPoland's only appearance in the final between 2005 and 2011, was in 2008. Even then, its song (\"For Life\", sung by Isis Gee) placed a lowly 24th.\n\nIn the 2009, Poland selected Lidia Kopania and her song \"I Don't Wanna Leave\" performed in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009, however she failed to qualify finished 12th with 43 points.\n\nThe 2010 entry for Poland was Marcin Mroziński with song \"Legenda\", country performed in the first semi-final on 25 May 2010 but he didn't qualify for the final, finishing 13th with 44 points.\n\nIn 2011, Poland was represented by Magdalena Tul, and the country's entry was sung in Polish. Her song was called \"Jestem\", translated as \"I'm\", although initially a favorite with bookmakers, \"Jestem\" failed to qualify finished last 19th with 18 points in the first semi-final. This is the worst Polish result to date.\n\nMembers of the Polish OGAE have said at their annual convention that they would like Edyta Górniak to represent Poland for a second time. For years it was unknown if Górniak would enter Eurovision again, until when in 2016 she made a second attempt at representing her country in the contest, placing third in the national final.\n\nIn December 2011, it was announced that Poland would not compete at the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku. The Polish broadcaster stated that having to organize the European Football Championship 2012 (hosted by Poland and Ukraine) was a major factor in their withdrawal. TVP informed esctoday.com that their decision to abstain would not hamper their chances of being back in 2013, leaving the door open for a return then. However, Poland confirmed on 22 November 2012 that it would not be participating in 2013.\n\nTVP, the Polish national broadcaster has confirmed on 5 December 2013 that Poland will return to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2014. On 25 February, it was announced that Donatan and Cleo would represent Poland with their song \"My Słowianie\".

Donatan and Cleo performed 9th in the final and ended up placing 14th out of 26 with 62 points. The duo fared clearly better with the televoters, finishing third in the semi-final and 5th in the final respectively.\n\nIn 2015 TVP has selected their entry internally again by choosing Monika Kuszyńska and her song \"In The Name of Love\". She was the first ever Eurovision participant to sit in a wheelchair during her performance, due to the fact that she was paralyzed after being involved in a serious car accident in 2006. Monika performed last in the second semi-final on 21 May 2015 and qualified for the final placing 8th with 57 points. In the final, she came 23rd out of 27 acts, receiving ten points. Alike Donatan and Cleo, she fared clearly better with the televoters, coming fourth in the semi-final and 15th in the final respectively.\n\nIn 2016, TVP went back to conducting a national final, called Krajowe Eliminacje, with Michał Szpak winning. Szpak performed second in the second semi-final on 12 May 2016, and qualified for the final by finishing in sixth place, with 151 points. In the final, held on 14 May 2016, he performed 12th and placed 8th out of 26 acts, with 229 points, which gave Poland their third best result ever.\n\nIn 2017, TVP decided to host the second edition of the national final, with Kasia Moś and her song \"Flashlight\" winning. Moś performed 11th in the first semi-final on 9 May 2017. She qualified for the final placing 9th with 119 points. In the final, held on 13 May 2017, she performed 2nd and came 22nd out of 26 acts with 64 points total.\n\nPoland's run of qualifications came to an end in 2018, when the song \"Light Me Up\" by Polish DJ Gromee and Swedish vocalist Lukas Meijer, again chosen during the national final, failed to qualify to the final by placing 14th with 81 points in the second semi-final. It is the first Polish entry since its return to the contest in 2014, to not qualify for the final.\n\nIn 2019, TVP returned to internal selection, after a successful internal choice of Roksana Węgiel for Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018. On 15 February 2019 it was announced that TVP has chosen Tulia for the Polish representative to Tel Aviv. However Poland failed to qualify for the grand final by placing 11th with 120 points in the first semi-final only 2-point behind Belarus.\n\nIn 2020, TVP will use talent show \"Szansa na sukces\" to select the Polish artist and song, having used the show to select the song \"Superhero\" performed by Viki Gabor for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2019, winning the contest.\n\n\n"}

Ancient or primitive granaries are most often made out of pottery. Granaries are often built above the ground to keep the stored food away from mice and other animals.\n\nFrom ancient times grain has been stored in bulk. The oldest granaries yet found date back to 9500 BC and are located in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A settlements in the Jordan Valley. The first were located in places between other buildings. However beginning around 8500 BC, they were moved inside houses, and by 7500 BC storage occurred in special rooms. The first granaries measured 3 x 3 m on the outside and had suspended floors that protected the grain from rodents and insects and provided air circulation.\n\nThese granaries are followed by those in Mehrgarh in the Indus Valley from 6000 BC. The ancient Egyptians made a practice of preserving grain in years of plenty against years of scarcity. The climate of Egypt being very dry, grain could be stored in pits for a long time without discernible loss of quality.\n\nHistorically, a silo was a pit for storing grain. It is distinct from a granary, which is an above-ground structure.\n\nSimple storage granaries raised up on four or more posts appeared in the Yangshao culture in China and after the onset of intensive agriculture in the Korean peninsula during the Mumun pottery period (c. 1000 B.C.) as well as in the Japanese archipelago during the Final Jōmon/Early Yayoi periods (c. 800 B.C.). In the archaeological vernacular of Northeast Asia, these features are lumped with those that may have also functioned as residences and together are called 'raised floor buildings'.\n\nIn vernacular architecture of Indonesian archipelago granaries are made of wood and bamboo materials and most of them are built raised up on four or more posts to avoid rodents and insects. Examples of Indonesian granary styles are the Sundanese \"leuit\" and Minang \"rangkiang\".\n\nIn Great Britain small granaries were built on mushroom-shaped stumps called staddle stones. They were built of timber frame construction and often had slate roofs. Larger ones were similar to linhays, but with the upper floor enclosed. Access to the first floor was usually via stone staircase on the outside wall.\n\nTowards the close of the 19th century, warehouses specially intended for holding grain began to multiply in Great Britain. There are climatic difficulties in the way of storing grain in Great Britain on a large scale, but these difficulties have been largely overcome.\n\nModern grain farming operations often use manufactured steel granaries to store grain on-site until it can be trucked to major storage facilities in anticipation of shipping. The large \"mechanized\" facilities, particularly seen in Russia and North America are known as grain elevators.\n\nGrain must be kept away from moisture for as long as possible to preserve it in good condition and prevent mold growth. Newly harvested grain brought into a granary tends to contain excess moisture, which encourages mold growth leading to fermentation and heating, both of which are undesirable and affect quality. Fermentation generally spoils grain and may cause chemical changes that create poisonous mycotoxins.\n\nOne traditional remedy is to spread the grain in thin layers on a floor, where it is turned to aerate it thoroughly. Once the grain is sufficiently dry it can be transferred to a granary for storage. Today, this can be done by means of a mechanical grain auger to move grain from one granary to another.\n\nIn modern silos, grain is typically force-aerated \"in situ\" or circulated through external grain drying equipment.\n\n"}

She served as chief of staff to Governor Clinton for seven years. As deputy chair of the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign, Wright established the rapid response system that was responsible for defending Clinton's record in Arkansas and promptly answering all personal attacks on the candidate. During the 1992 campaign, Wright coined the term \"bimbo eruptions\" to describe rumors alleging extramarital affairs by Clinton. In the 1990s, Wright was an executive for The Wexler Group, a lobbying firm in Washington, D.C. She currently resides in Rogers, Arkansas.\n\nWright was born July 4, 1943 in Alpine, Texas. She attended Alpine High School and received her higher education at the University of Texas at Austin, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1967.\n\nWright worked for George McGovern's unsuccessful 1972 presidential campaign. It was during this campaign when she met Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham. Wright became close friends with Rodham, a woman she thought had the potential to become a U.S. senator or America's first female president. In 1973, Wright moved to Washington, D.C. and began working for the National Women's Political Caucus, hoping the job would further Rodham's political viability. During Clinton's unsuccessful run for the House of Representatives in 1974, Wright commuted on the weekends to Arkansas to assist his campaign.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Wright founded and served as executive director of the now-defunct National Women's Education Fund, an organization based in Washington, D.C. which raised funds for women candidates. While there, she designed, organized and conducted training programs throughout the country for women candidates, campaign managers, and officeholders. in 1977, Wright became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP).\n\nIn 1980, ten days after his defeat for re-election as Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton asked Wright to come to Little Rock and help organize the campaign's records and files. Bringing only her suitcase, Wright traveled to Little Rock and began formulating Clinton's political comeback. She organized and ran Clinton's successful 1982 gubernatorial campaign, as well as his re-election campaigns in 1984 and 1986. \"The New York Times\" credited Wright as being \"an architect of [Clinton's] rise to power in Arkansas.\" In 1982, Wright was appointed as chief of staff to Governor Clinton. Her duties included managing public support for Clinton's controversial education reforms. Wright resigned from her position in 1989, citing exhaustion.\n\nIn 1990, Wright was elected chair of the Democratic Party of Arkansas and was hired as its executive director. While serving as a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in 1992, Wright led a seminar entitled \"High Tech Politics\". She resigned to return to Arkansas and assist Clinton during his run for the presidency. Wright served as deputy chair of the Clinton campaign during the 1992 election, but did not work for the Clinton administration.\n\nOn the eve of the 1992 election, Anne Wexler offered Wright a position as executive vice president of The Wexler Group, a lobbying firm whose parent company is the WPP Group. As a lobbyist, Wright's clients included American Airlines, the American Dietetic Association, the American Forest & Paper Association, and ARCO, among others.\n\nWright is a supporter of the feminist movement, a prisoners' rights advocate, and strongly opposes capital punishment. She often visits inmates on Arkansas' death row at the Varner Unit, a high-security prison located near Grady.\n\nWhile visiting a death row inmate in 2005, Wright was accused of trying to smuggle money into the prison. After the incident, Wright lost visitation privileges for six months. In August 2009, the Arkansas State's Attorney's office filed 51 felony charges against Wright, accusing her of attempting to smuggle a knife, tweezers, a boxcutter, and 48 tattoo needles into the Varner Unit on May 22. During an interview with the Associated Press, Wright denied any wrongdoing, saying that the needles were in a bag of chips that she got from a prison vending machine. In April 2010, Wright agreed in a plea bargain to plead no contest to two misdemeanors; in exchange, 48 felony counts were dropped. She was sentenced to one year of probation and a $2000 fine.\n\nWright appeared in the 1993 documentary film \"The War Room\", a behind the scenes look at Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. Wright also appeared in the 2004 documentary \"The Hunting of the President: The Ten-Year Campaign to Destroy Bill Clinton\", a film adaption of the book written by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons, and the 2012 \"American Experience\" documentary \"Clinton\".\n\nThe character of Libby Holden in Joe Klein's 1996 novel \"Primary Colors\" is loosely based on Wright. In the 1998 film adaption, Holden's character was portrayed by Kathy Bates, a role which earned Bates an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\n"}
{"id": "1998277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998277", "title": "Charleston, New Zealand", "text": "Charleston, New Zealand\n\nCharleston is a village in the South Island of New Zealand located 30 km south of Westport. It was founded as a goldmining town after a major goldrush in 1867, and is now an adventure tourist village noted for its extensive limestone caves and caving experiences. Guided tours of the nearby Metro Cave / Te Ananui Cave are operated out of Charleston and travel up the Nile River valley.\nCharleston's origins owe much to gold prospector William Fox. He was born in Ireland in about 1826 and as a young man became a sailor, then a gold prospector. He was on the Californian goldfields about 1850; then on the Victorian goldfields in Australia; and on the Tuapeka goldfield in Otago in 1861.\n\nIn 1862 Bill Fox's prospecting activities in the Arrow district excited intense interest. In 1864, Fox travelled to the West Coast. He prospected widely for gold and first discovered it at Fox Creek, a tributary of the Arahura River behind Hokitika, in January 1865.\n\nAccording to local historian Les Wright, in July 1866 Fox organised a prospecting voyage to what was later named Fox River but didn't find gold there. He led the party on 20 km north to where Charleston would later be, but although they found gold in the sand there, it was too fine to save. So Fox went south to Ōkārito to find out how the miners there were extracting it from fine sand.\n\nIn August 1866, while Fox was away, took the credit for the Pakihi ('Parkeese') field which later became known as the Charleston field. At first, goods going to 'Parkeese' were landed at Woodpecker Bay, south of Fox River, and humped about 20 km north to the goldfield. Then Capt Charles Bonner managed to squeeze the ketch 'Constant' into a tiny bay near 'Parkeese' and the town that formed around this new landing spot, Constant Bay, was named Charleston, probably in his honour. Reed (2002) indicates that the community was originally known as 'Charlie's Town', and then 'Charles Town', before settling on the current name. Unlike its more famous American namesake, the town's name is generally pronounced with three syllables ().\n\nIn November 1866 Fox made a rich strike at Brighton (now Tiromoana), about 10 miles south of Charleston, and in May 1867 a strike near Charleston itself precipitated the last real 'rush' on the West Coast. Brighton was a much bigger town at the start, but Charleston lasted longer and the two have been confused in places. In 1867 Brighton and its environs had 53 hotels while Charleston had 37. However, in 1975-79 remains of around 99 hotels where found by old bottle collectors in the Charleston area which have been documented, with the European hotel the last surviving hotel which was pulled down after the 100 year festivities around 1968. Hannahs shoe shop chain had the very first shop in Charleston in 1867. Marys hotel at the south end of the nine mile beach to the north of Charleston being said to be gateway to Charleston which was also pulled down around 1970. Open cast Coal mines replaced gold mining in Charleston with the Mowarts mine and latter the McGlockland mine which supplied coal to nearby Westport, Gold was still mined on the south end of the nine mile beach up till the late 1970s.\nIn 1990s the seals from Cape Foulwind near Westport moved south to the Charleston coast and made camp at the mouth of the Brimalaw creek about 2 km south of Constant bay. Three ship wrecks have been located around the mouths of both Constant bay and its neighbour Joyce bay which are believed to be from the gold rush times.\nCharleston was the site for the first cement buildings in New Zealand; a Butter factory and a small house which still stands around 3 km south of Charleston next to Cake hill. The Nile river still has the Cement walls on the river of the old swing bridge which was the main road through the coast in 1899. Charleston is littered with old gold workings and one should watch for old mining shafts which are hidden throughout the area. Charleston has got coal, clay, and sandstone deposits which all have been mined over the years. Wellington's post master got a promotion to the Charleston Post office in 1867 which was a big step up in his career at the time.\nThe Charleston school was moved to the Westport south school and the old school teacher's house (which still stands) was also the Charleston Police station and Charleston jail beforehand. \n\nThe population of Charleston during the goldrush is often exaggerated with 30,000 or even 100,000 being mentioned. At the peak of the gold rush, the population of the entire West Coast is believed to have been only 35,000. The early 1867 census, at the peak of the Charleston rush, showed 5,000 on the entire Charleston field and 6,000 on the Brighton field ten miles to the south.\n\nThe Waitakere or Nile River emerges just north of Charleston from an area rich in limestone cliffs and caves. Cave and rafting tours operate from Charleston into the Nile River valley, including a short bush tram track for part of the transport.\nThe Fox River 30 km south of Charleston is named after William Fox.\n\n"}

He graduated from the National Military College with a degree in civil engineering, was promoted as army major by 1921, and became a close associate of the War Minister, General Agustín Justo. Justo was elected president in 1932, and appointed Pistarini Minister of Public Works in 1935. Pistarini's his first important initiative as minister was the proposed construction of a new international airport outside Buenos Aires. He was promoted to the rank of general in 1937 and, between then and 1940, was stationed in Germany and Italy. Appointed Director of Army Engineers upon his return, Pistarini recommended German contractors for public works in Argentina and was open regarding his Nazi and Fascist sympathies. \n\nHis role in the 1943 coup d'état resulted in his appointment as director of the Campo de Mayo army training base.

Pistarini was retained as Public Works Minister by Perón when the latter was elected president in 1946, in which capacity he administered Perón's ambitious public works agenda. He oversaw and helped plan the construction or development of modern barracks, Argentina's first expressways, numerous public vacation resorts, 11,000 schools, water treatment plants, a modern merchant marine, 650,000 housing units and the planting of two million trees, the nation's first international airport, among other works.

{"id": "1998305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998305", "title": "Adelaide Zoo", "text": "Adelaide Zoo\n\nAdelaide Zoo is Australia's second oldest zoo (after Melbourne Zoo), and it is operated on a non-profit basis. It is located in the parklands just north of the city centre of Adelaide, South Australia. It is administered by the Royal Zoological Society of South Australia Incorporated (trading as Zoos SA) which is a full institutional member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA) and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). and which also administers the Monarto Safari Park near Murray Bridge.\n\nThe zoo houses about 300 native and exotic species, with over 3,000 animals on site. The zoo's most recent enclosures are in the second phase of the South-East Asia exhibit, known as Immersion, providing visitors with the experience of walking through the jungle, with Sumatran tigers and orangutans seemingly within reach.\n\nFive buildings within the zoo have been listed as state heritage places on the South Australian Heritage Register including the front entrance on Frome Road and the former Elephant House. The zoo is also a botanical garden and the grounds contain significant exotic and native flora, including a Moreton Bay fig planted in 1877.\n\nThe giant panda exhibit, which opened in December 2009, is home to two giant pandas, Wang Wang and Funi, which will remain at the zoo until at least 2024.\n\nAdelaide Zoo first opened on 23 May 1883, occupying (now ) of land granted by the Government. It was founded by the South Australian Acclimatization and Zoological Society. The society later became the Royal Zoological Society of South Australia after a Royal Charter was granted by King George VI in 1937.\n\nThe first director of the zoo (from 1882 to 1893) was R. E. Minchin. He was succeeded by his son A. C. Minchin (from 1893 to 1934), and grandson R. R. L. Minchin (from 1935 to 1940). Another grandson, Alfred Keith Minchin ran the private Koala Farm in the North Parklands 1936–1960; the surplus koalas were set free on Kangaroo Island.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century the zoo was involved in the export of live birds, with 99% of Australia's exports of live native birds, mainly finches and parrots for aviculture, passing through either Adelaide or Taronga zoos. At a time when the need for conservation of Australia's native birds, and control of their trade was becoming increasingly apparent, South Australia lagged behind other states in passing appropriate legislation.\nIn 1962 a new director of the zoo, William Gasking, was quickly dismissed through the power exerted by the Zoo Council president, Fred Basse, on the grounds that Gasking would not cooperate with the bird trade. However, when Basse retired the trade in birds dropped to a tenth of what it had been two years before. Since then the zoo's administration has been restructured and the zoo has regained public credibility and scientific status.\n\nThe modern zoo has moved away from the traditional housing of species separately in pairs. Now species are grouped together as they would be in the wild, in exhibits that are carefully planned according to region. Enclosures have been designed with the needs of the animals in mind, providing a more natural habitat, which also serves an educational purpose for visitors. Although some of the zoo's heritage listed enclosures such as the Elephant House have been retained, they are no longer used to house animals; (the Elephant House now has educational signs). The last elephant housed at the Adelaide Zoo, Samorn, was moved to Monarto in 1991, where she died three years later.\n\nThe flamingo exhibit was opened in 1885, and is one of the few to have remained in the same position to date. Originally it was stocked with 10 flamingos, however most died during a drought in 1915. In 2014, one of two surviving flamingos in the exhibit, thought to be the oldest in the world at 83 years of age, died. The remaining Chilean flamingo at Adelaide zoo, the last flamingo in Australia, was euthanized on 6 April 2018.\n\nThe zoo has a particular focus on species from the Gondwana \"supercontinent\" which later broke up into South America, India, Africa, Australia and South East Asia. The botanic similarities between the regions are featured in the zoo's main exhibits, which include a South East Asian Rainforest, and Australian Rainforest Wetlands walk-through aviary. The South East Asian exhibit combines Sumatran orangutan and siamang together. It also combines Malayan tapir and dusky leaf monkey together. In the past, in fact almost to the present day, Adelaide Zoo was famous for having the best bird collection and display of all the Australian zoos.\n\nThe zoo also has a focus on educational programs. There is a selection of \"get to know the zoo\" type of tours, a large \"children's zoo\" area, and from April 2009, an educational area for secondary school students and their teachers. Schools can hire the facility and groups can sleep there, with a member from the zoo supervising. Also, a new educational area called the Envirodome opened in April 2009. Night walks, tours and animal research can be done. More information on the educational programs can be found on the zoo's web site.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican Lion\nAldabra Giant Tortoise\nBlack-and-white colobus\nGiraffe\nHamadryas baboon\nMandrill\nMeerkat\nPygmy Hippopotamus\nRing-tailed lemur\nServal\nSpotted hyena\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 1909, the Strand Magazine reported that a snake had swallowed a rug weighing almost 12 pounds, and which survived undamaged in the snake's stomach until disgorged almost a month later. The short article featured a photograph of the disgorged rug which was 5 feet 3 inches long. A bear also killed a man, a few years earlier.\n\nIn 1985, two men broke in and killed 64 animals.\n\nIn 2005, a boy was impaled when he tried to jump the spiked fence with his friends at night. He did not survive.\n\nOn 30 October 2008, a 78-year-old blind greater flamingo named \"Greater\" was beaten, allegedly by a group of teenagers. Four teenagers were charged after visitors reported an incident to zoo staff. The male flamingo was left \"extremely stressed\".\n\nOn Mother's Day 2009, the female orangutan, Karta, built an escape route out of plant material and tripped the hot wires with a stick. After a short while on the \"outside\" she dropped back into the exhibit with no harm done.\n\nThe last captive Javan Rhino was displayed at the Adelaide Zoo as an Indian Rhinoceros due to the lack of knowledge about this species.

The film has won several awards, including the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 2000, but it is banned in Iran.\n\nThe film begins in a maternity ward of a hospital, where the mother of Solmaz Gholami is upset to learn that her daughter has just given birth to a girl, even though the ultrasound indicated that the baby would be a boy. Worrying that the parents of the child's father will force their son to divorce her daughter, she tells another daughter to call her uncles.\n\nAt the phone booth, she passes by three young women, including Arezou and Nargess, who have just escaped prison. The three of them are trying to come up with money so that they can go to Nargess's home village. The third prisoner is immediately arrested, as she tries to pawn a gold chain, leaving just the two women. While waiting for Arezou in a market, Nargess spots a copy of A Wheatfield with Cypresses and mistakes it for a painting of her hometown. She shows it to Arezou, describing the paradise that awaits them at the end of their bus journey. Arezou acquires enough money from an acquaintance to get Nargess a bus ticket. Arezou decides not to go to Nargess' hometown, explaining that she would prefer to envision it as a paradise than to experience the real thing. The two of them separate.\n\nAt the bus station, Nargess convinces the clerk to issue her a ticket, despite not having a male companion or a student card. After buying a present to bring home, Nargess returns to the bus only to find it is being searched by police. She retraces her steps in search of Arezou, but cannot find her. Instead she tries to find another prisoner, Pari, who also snuck out of the prison that day. Pari's father aggressively denies Nargess entry to the house and lies that his daughter is dead. Just as Nargess leaves defeated, Pari's two brothers arrive, and angrily force their way into the house, in order to \"talk\" to their sister. Pari manages to escape, and eventually makes her way to a hospital where she finds Elham, another former prisoner who has hidden her past and is now a nurse, married to a doctor.\n\nPari confesses to Elham that she is four months pregnant and entreats her to help her abort the baby. Elham, concerned about arousing suspicions about her own past, is reluctant to do anything to help her, so Pari is left to wander the streets at night. Without ID, she cannot get into a hotel. At a street corner, she finds a mother trying to abandon her little girl, hoping that she will find a better life with a family. She continues wandering the street.\n\nThe mother is caught by an undercover police officer who thinks she is a prostitute, but she later manages to escape. Then, another woman who has been picked up as a prostitute is taken to prison. She is placed in a cell with other women we have previously met in the film, and the phone rings outside the metal door. A guard answers and comes to the window, calling for Solmaz Gholami, the woman with a baby girl in the first scene, bringing the story to a circular conclusion.\n\nThe film does not have a central protagonist: instead, it is constructed around a sequence of short interconnecting stories that illustrate the everyday challenges women face in Iran. Each story intersects, but none is complete, leaving the viewer to imagine both the background and the ending. All the actors are amateurs, except Fereshteh Sadre Orafaee who plays Pari, and Fatemeh Naghavi, who plays the mother abandoning her daughter.\n\nThroughout the film, Panahi focuses on the little rules symbolizing difficulties of life for Iranian women, such as the need to wear a chador under certain circumstances, or not being allowed to travel alone. He frequently uses contrast to illustrate both happiness and misery in contemporary Tehran: for example, a marriage party, symbolizing a happy ending, takes place in the background while a young girl is abandoned. Similarly, the scene where Nargess describes to Arezou the beauty of the landscape of her hometown where she grew up playing with her brother, while taking care to point out the imperfections of the artist's hand, is a poignant reminder of hope and despair that runs as a common thread in the lives of his women characters throughout the film.\n\n\"The Circle\" received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 93% \"fresh\" score based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's consensus states: \"Bleak, yet powerful, \"The Circle\" offers a searing indictment of the oppressive conditions experienced by women in Iran.\" Metacritic reports an 85 out of 100 score based on 28 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\n"}

It is one of the largest urban sculpture gardens in the country, with 40 permanent art installations and several other temporary pieces that are moved in and out periodically.\n\nThe park is located to the west of Loring Park and the Basilica of Saint Mary. \nThe land was first purchased by the park board around the start of the 20th century, when it was known as \"The Parade\" because it had been used for military drills. It became known as the Armory Gardens after park superintendent Theodore Wirth created a formal design that included a U.S. National Guard armory (Kenwood Armory) for Spanish War volunteers.\n\nWorking as a civic and cultural center, in 1913 a floral convention transformed the land into floral gardens, which it remained for the next 50 years. In 1934, six years after the Walker Art Gallery opened across the street, the Armory was demolished for its instability, and a new Armory built in downtown Minneapolis, turning the Armory Gardens over to the Minneapolis Park Board. Since 1908 the area of today's Sculpture Garden and land to the west had been used for sport recreation via mildly-improved playing fields and the 1950 construction of the original Parade Stadium. In 1988, the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden opened, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and landscape architects Quinnel and Rothschild. Parade Stadium was demolished in 1990, two years later the Garden was expanded, adding . Michael Van Valkenburgh and Associates, Inc. designed the northward extension to complement the original space with a more open area that features a walkway and the Alene Grossman Memorial Arbor.\n\nThe centerpiece of the garden is the \"Spoonbridge and Cherry\" (1985–1988) fountain designed by husband and wife Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen.\n\nA pedestrian bridge, the Irene Hixon Whitney Bridge (1987), designed by Siah Armajani, now crosses Hennepin Avenue, connecting the sculpture garden to Loring Park.\n\n"}

In 2003 he wrote an influential report for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) in which he showed that free and open source software (FOSS) had already become a vital part of the United States Department of Defense software infrastructure, and that banning or restricting its use would have had serious detrimental impacts on DoD security, research capabilities, operational capabilities, and long-term cost efficiency. His report ended a debate about whether FOSS should be banned from U.S. DoD systems, and in time helped lead to the current official U.S. DoD policy of treating FOSS and proprietary software as equals. The report is referenced on the DoD CIO web site and has been influential in promoting broader recognition of the importance of free and open source software in government circles. Bollinger is also known for his activity in the IEEE Computer Society, where he was an editor for IEEE Software for six years, wrote the founding charter for \"IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine\", and received an \"IEEE Third Millennium Medal\" for lifetime contributions to \"IEEE\".

It was funded by a $500,000 donation from art collector Frederick R. Weisman and is permanently located in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. The piece was completed and installed in 1988 for the Sculpture Garden's opening and consists of a large cherry resting atop a large spoon partially straddling a small pond.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, commissioned a piece of work from married couple Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, whose first artistic collaboration came in 1976. The work, which had its $500,000 budget donated by art collector Frederick R. Weisman, was to be placed in the new outdoor Minneapolis Sculpture Garden across Vineland Place from the Walker on land owned by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board. \n\nAn early concept for the sculpture was a Viking ship with a dragon figurehead set in a circular reflecting pool; a 1986 article in the \"Star Tribune\" describes this vision as having been \"quickly abandoned\". The iconography of the spoon had been present in Oldenburg's work for a number of years since he acquired a piece of kitsch depicting a spoon atop a mass of chocolate in 1962. The cherry was contributed by van Bruggen who found inspiration in the formality of the sculpture garden's design, in the Palace of Versailles, and in the dining etiquette of Louis XIV of France's court. Walker curator Siri Engberg said in 2013 that the bowl of the spoon was associated with \"the prow of a Viking ship, a duck rising out of the water, various flora and fauna, [and] ice skating\" for Oldenburg and van Bruggen. Martin Friedman, director of the Walker, said of the work that the artists did not intend to craft a \"sculptural symbol of Minneapolis\" but that he believed \"Spoonbridge and Cherry\" would \"be a landmark and [would] give a lot of people pleasure\".\n\nThe piece was fabricated between 1987 and 1988 at two shipyards, one in Boothbay, Maine, and the other in Bristol, Rhode Island, and finished in New Haven, Connecticut, at sculpture fabricator Lippincott, Inc. It was placed in the northern portion of the Sculpture Garden by two cranes on May 9, 1988. The Sculpture Garden held opening ceremonies September 9–11 of that year, with an official dedication on September 10 featuring a band of spoon players.\n\n\"Spoonbridge and Cherry\" was entirely repainted in 1995. In 2012, the word \"Kony\" was spraypainted onto the sculpture's spoon, possibly as part of Invisible Children's Cover the Night campaign, requiring the sculpture to be scrubbed and repaired which Walker staff were able to complete within 48 hours.\n\n\"Spoonbridge and Cherry\" measures and straddles a small pond built in the shape of a linden tree seed, evoking the lindens in the surrounding park. The pond's shores were lined with irises and reeds. The sculpture is built from stainless steel and aluminum and coated with polyurethane enamel. The cherry portion of the piece weighs while the spoon portion weighs .\n\nThe sculpture emits filtered water from both the tip and the base of the cherry's stem, the latter intended to keep the cherry gleaming in the light.\n\nThe editors of Phaidon Press wrote favorably of the sculpture's placement in a park frequented by families, writing that the \"surprise of finding a oversized fruit spooned up in a park, together with its curved forms and the bright colour, creates a sensuous joy that makes the work immediately accessible to a wide audience, including children.\"\n\nWriting in the \"Star Tribune\" a year after the Sculpture Garden's opening, Chris Waddington found the linden seed pond critical to enjoying \"Spoonbridge\", writing that in winter months when the pond was frozen and snowed over, the sculpture \"can seem like a soulless mock-up, a quirky idea that lost its charm somewhere between the artist's hand and the factory where it was built; but with spring comes the fountain's spray, the pool's play of liquid reflections on steel and an animate charge that recalls the poetry of the artists' original sketches.\"\n\nWithin a decade of the Sculpture Garden's opening, the \"Star Tribune\" reported that \"Spoonbridge\" was \"something of an icon for the Walker\". In 2001, Eric Dregni wrote that the sculpture had \"become the unofficial symbol of Minneapolis\" and in 2008, \"City Pages\" described it as \"one of the Twin Cities' most iconic images.\" The Walker reported receiving more requests for images of \"Spoonbridge and Cherry\" than any other work in its collections.\n\n"}

Its name references the Hastings Townsite, part of which was also known as New Brighton, which lay at the end of the Douglas Road from New Westminster, founded as a resort and watering-hole and as a port to connect the other settlements of the inlet—Gastown, Moodyville and Barnet—to the city.\n\nThe land was originally granted in trust to the City by the Province in 1888 as part of the will of its late owner, with the site to be kept in perpetuity as wilderness park for public use. However, throughout most of the twentieth century, Hastings Park has been home to two institutions: the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) and the Hastings Racecourse, and the PNE's amusement park, Playland. Over the years, the site lost its park character because of the construction of many buildings and parking lots. These included the long-vanished Exhibition Building, a Mission-style affair with ornate cupolas and decor, torn down by the 1920s due to structural inefficiencies. In its place three large art deco concrete buildings and one smaller one - the Showmart, Food Building and Forum and the Gardens, respectively.\n\nOver time PNE facilities grew in the post-war period by the addition of the BC Building, housing the once-famous Challenger Relief Map of British Columbia and the Agrodome, plus the regular expansion of buildings and structures in Playland, most visibly its roller coaster, prominent on the eastern approach into the city via Hastings Street and via Highway 1, but also a vintage games arcade and electric bumper-car \"rink\". Next to it, in time for the British Empire Games hosted by Vancouver in 1954, was Empire Stadium, its concrete stands now a community track and sport facility. Added still later was the Pacific Coliseum, the park's largest single structure and for many years the city's largest indoor sports and entertainment venue (with Empire Stadium being the largest outdoor). Operations at the racecourse also expanded over times, with an extensive collection of horse barns and horse-trailer parking lots.\n\nA Restoration Plan was prepared with the neighbourhood residents and approved by the City in 1997.\n\nThe sanctuary at Hastings Park was one of the many developments made between 1997 and 2001 in order to improve the facilities associated with the park. Within the sanctuary is a large pond surrounded by native plants and walkways. The sanctuary also supports many species of birds and small animals. Furthermore, the pond is stocked with rainbow trout that can be fished for off of a small dock at the northwest corner of the pond. \n\nA recent development to this area is the Creekway Park, which is a daylighting stream that will connect the sanctuary to New Brighton Park. This project, which completed its first stage in September 2013, also includes new pedestrian and bicycle pathways between the two parks as well as providing an ecological corridor to the Burrard Inlet. The sanctuary area of the park continues to be developed.\n\n\n"}

The themes of the allegory are the importance of fidelity, and the certainty of death.\n\nThe tale of Hiram Abiff as passed down in Masonic Lodges underpins the third degree. It starts with his arrival in Jerusalem, and his appointment by Solomon as chief architect and master of works at the construction of his temple. As the temple is nearing completion, three fellowcraft masons from the workforce ambush him as he leaves the building, demanding the secrets of a master mason. Hiram is challenged by each in turn, and at each refusal to divulge the information his assailant strikes him with a mason's tool (differing between jurisdictions). He is injured by the first two assailants, and struck dead by the last. \n\nHis murderers hide his body under a pile of rubble, returning at night to move the body outside the city, where they bury it in a shallow grave marked with a sprig of acacia. As the Master is missed the next day, Solomon sends out a group of fellowcraft masons to search for him. The loose acacia is accidentally discovered, and the body exhumed to be given a decent burial. The hiding place of the \"three ruffians\" is also discovered, and they are brought to justice. Solomon informs his workforce that the secret word of a master mason is now lost. He replaces it with a substitute word. This word is considered a secret by Masons, but for hundreds of years various \"revelations\" of the word have been made, usually all differing from each other. One such \"revelation\" is \"Mach-benak\" or \"decay-apparently\" based on gestures given and words spoken upon the discovery of Hiram's body. Such is the general legend as related in the Anglo-American jurisdictions.\n\nIn Continental Freemasonry the tale is slightly different: a large number of master masons (not just Hiram) are working on the Temple, and the three ruffians are seeking the passwords and signs that will give them a higher wage. The result is the same, but this time it is master masons who find the body. The secrets are not lost, but Solomon orders them buried under the Temple, inscribed on Hiram's grave, and the same substitution is made as a mark of respect. The secrets \"lost\" in the other tradition are here given to new master masons as part of their ritual. In this version, Hiram is often renamed Adoniram.\n\nAnderson's revised 1738 Constitutions describe the place of the Deputy Grand Master, to the left of the newly installed Grand Master John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, as the \"Chair of Hiram Abiff\".\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, there are three separate instances of people named Hiram that were involved in the construction of the temple of Solomon:\n\n\nFlavius Josephus in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (Chapter 8:76) refers to Hiram as τεχνίτης, artificer, craftsman. \"Now Solomon sent for an artificer out of Tyre, whose name was Hiram: he was by birth of the tribe of Naphtali, on his mother's side (for she was of that tribe); but his father was Ur, of the stock of the Israelites.\"\n\nThe Targum Sheni, an Aramaic commentary on the Book of Esther written sometime between the fall of Rome and the Crusades, credits Hiram with the construction of a miraculous throne for Solomon, which in Esther's time is being used by the descendants of Cyrus the Great.\n\nThe most elaborate version of the legend occurs in Gérard de Nerval's 1851 account, \"Voyage en Orient\", where he relates the tale, inserting all the masonic passwords, as part of the story of Balkis, the \"Queen of the Morning\" and \"Soliman\", Prince of the Genii. This is an elaboration of the second version above, where the Master Craftsman is named Adoniram. Before his death, he undergoes mystical adventures as his tale is interwoven with that of Solomon and Balkis, the Queen of Sheba. The ruffians who kill him are under the instruction of Solomon himself. De Nerval relates the story as having been told in an Eastern coffee house over a two-week period. A similar account is given in Charles William Heckethorn's \"The Secret Societies of all Ages and Countries\", where Solomon plots to destroy Hiram because of the mutual love between Hiram and the Queen of Sheba. Meanwhile, in 1862, the whole adventure of Adoniram's love for Balkis and his murder by three workmen in the pay of Solomon had been set to music in Charles Gounod's opera, \"La reine de Saba\".\n\nThere have been many proposals for the origin of the masonic Hiram Abiff story, which are dismissed by most Masonic scholars.\n\nVeneration of the Sun\n\nAccording to AllFreemasonry.com, the legend of Hiram Abiff has roots in ancient veneration of the sun.\n\nAccording to authors Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight, the prototype for Hiram Abiff was the Egyptian king Seqenenre Tao II, who (they claim) died in an almost identical manner. This idea is dismissed by most Masonic scholars.\n\nIn his book \"The Sufis\", the Afghan scholar Idries Shah suggested that Dhul-Nun al-Misri might have been the origin of the character Hiram Abiff in the masonic Master Mason ritual. The link, he believes, was through the Sufi sect Al-Banna (\"The Builders\") who built the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. This fraternity could have influenced some early masonic guilds which borrowed heavily from the Oriental architecture in the creation of the Gothic style.\n\nThe French masonic historian Paul Naudon has highlighted the similarity between the death of Hiram and the murder of Renaud de Montauban in the late 12th Century chanson de geste, \"The Four Sons of Aymon\". Renaud, like his prototype Saint Reinold, was killed by a hammer-blow to the head while working as a mason at Cologne Cathedral, and his body hidden by his murderers before being miraculously re-discovered.\n\n"}

He specialises in dramatisations of historic events and is known for his signature use of hand-held cameras. \n\nHis early film \"Bloody Sunday\" (2002), about the 1972 shootings in Derry, Northern Ireland, won the Golden Bear at 52nd Berlin International Film Festival. Other films he has directed include three in the \"Bourne\" action/thriller series: \"The Bourne Supremacy\" (2004), \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" (2007), and \"Jason Bourne\" (2016); \"United 93\" (2006), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Director and received an Academy Award for Best Director nomination; \"Green Zone\" (2010); and \"Captain Phillips\" (2013). In 2004, he co-wrote and produced the film \"Omagh\", which won British Academy Television Award.\n\nIn 2007, Greengrass co-founded Directors UK, a professional organization of British filmmakers, and was its first president until 2014. In 2008, \"The Telegraph\" named him among the most influential people in British culture. In 2017, Greengrass was honoured with a British Film Institute Fellowship.\n\nGreengrass was born 13 August 1955 in Cheam, Surrey, England. His mother was a teacher and his father a river pilot and merchant seaman. His brother, Mark Greengrass, has become a noted English historian.\n\nGreengrass was educated at Westcourt Primary School, Gravesend Grammar School and Sevenoaks School, and attended Queens' College, Cambridge. He studied English Literature at the same time as Roger Michell. \n\nGreengrass first worked as a director in the 1980s, for the ITV current affairs programme \"World in Action\"; his investigation of timber-framed house construction has been cited as preventing its widespread adoption in Britain. At the same time he co-authored the book \"Spycatcher\" (1987) with Peter Wright, former assistant director of MI5. It contained enough sensitive information that the British Government made an unsuccessful attempt to ban it.\n\nGreengrass moved into drama, directing non-fiction, made-for-television films such as \"The One That Got Away\", based on Chris Ryan's book about SAS actions in the Gulf War and \"The Fix\", based on the 1964 betting scandal that shook British football.\n\nHis 1998 film \"The Theory of Flight\" starred Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter, who played a woman with motor neurone disease. The film dealt with the difficult issue of the sexuality of people with disabilities.\n\nGreengrass directed \"The Murder of Stephen Lawrence\" (1999), an account of Stephen Lawrence, a black youth whose murder was not properly investigated by the Metropolitan Police. His mother's investigations resulted in accusations about institutional racism in the police.\n\n\"Bloody Sunday\" (2002), depicted the 1972 Bloody Sunday shootings of Irish anti-internment activists by British soldiers in an almost documentary style; it shared First Prize at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival with Hayao Miyazaki's \"Spirited Away\". \"Bloody Sunday\" was inspired by Don Mullan's politically influential book \"Eyewitness Bloody Sunday\" (Wolfhound Press, 1997). A schoolboy witness of the events of Bloody Sunday, Mullan was co-producer and appeared as a figure in \"Bloody Sunday\".. \n\nIn 2004, Greengrass co-wrote the television film \"Omagh\" with Guy Hibbert. Based on the bombing of 1998, the film was a critical success, winning British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama. This was the first professional film that Greengrass had not directed; he was credited as a writer and producer. He had been working on \"The Bourne Supremacy\". The film was directed by Pete Travis. It was the second film Greengrass had written about terrorism and mass killing in Ireland after \"Bloody Sunday\".\n\nBased on that film, Greengrass was hired to direct 2004's \"The Bourne Supremacy\", a sequel to the 2002 film \"The Bourne Identity.\" The first film's director, Doug Liman, had left the project. The film starred Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac who realises he was once a top CIA assassin and is being pursued by his former employers. An unexpectedly major financial and critical success, it secured Greengrass's reputation and ability to get his smaller, more personal films made.\n\nIn 2006, Greengrass directed \"United 93\", a film based on the 11 September 2001 hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for Greengrass' quasi-documentary-style. After receiving many Best Director awards and nominations from critics' circles (including the Broadcast Film Critics Association), Greengrass won the BAFTA award for Best Director at the 60th British Academy Film Awards and received an Oscar nomination for Achievement in Directing at the 79th Academy Awards. For his role in writing the film, he earned the Writers Guild of America Award and BAFTA nominations for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nHe returned to the money-making Bourne franchise. \"The Bourne Ultimatum\", released in 2007, was an even bigger success than the previous two films. He was nominated for BAFTA Best Director at the 61st British Academy Film Awards.\n\nIn 2007, he co-founded Directors UK, a professional association for British directors. He served as founding president until July 2014.\n\nGreengrass's \"Green Zone\" stars Matt Damon as the head of a U.S. military team on an unsuccessful hunt for weapons of mass destruction in post-war Iraq. It was filmed in Spain and Morocco and released in 2010. The film was first announced as based on the bestselling, award-winning non-fiction book \"Imperial Life in the Emerald City\", by Rajiv Chandrasekaran, the \"Washington Post\"s Baghdad bureau chief. But the final film is a largely fictionalised action thriller only loosely inspired by events in the book.\n\n\"Captain Phillips\", Greengrass's film about the Maersk Alabama hijacking in 2009, was based on the book \"A Captain's Duty.\" It starred Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, and Faysal Ahmed. It was shot in 2012 in Massachusetts and Virginia in the United States, and Malta. It was released in 2013.\n\nGreengrass returned to direct the fifth Jason Bourne film, \"Jason Bourne\", with Damon starring again.

Schenck in command.\n\nThe new side-wheel ship sailed from San Francisco Bay on 8 March 1860, headed for the western Pacific, and reached Shanghai, China on 12 May. She then served in the East India Squadron, for the most part cruising along the Chinese coast to protect American citizens and to suppress pirates. She visited Japan in November but soon returned to Chinese waters. On 30 June 1861, she silenced a battery at the entrance to Qui Nhon Bay, Cochin China, which had fired upon her while she was searching for the missing boat and crew of American bark \"Myrtle\".\n\nOn 3 January 1862, \"Saginaw\" was decommissioned at Hong Kong and returned to Mare Island on 3 July for repairs.\n\nRelaunched on 3 December 1862 and recommissioned on 23 March 1863, \"Saginaw\" was attached to the Pacific Squadron and operated along the United States West Coast to prevent Confederate activity. She visited Puget Sound in the spring of 1863 to investigate reports that Confederate privateers were being outfitted in British Columbia, but returned after learning that the scheme had no chance of success.\n\nHer cruises in 1864 took \"Saginaw\" to ports in Mexico and Central America to protect the interests of the United States endangered by Confederate activity and by European interference in Mexico. During the closing months of the year, she escorted steamers of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company carrying rich cargoes of bullion from the California gold fields. In the spring of 1865, the ship was assigned to the United States Revenue Cutter Service but was returned to the Navy on 2 June 1865. She spent the remainder of 1865 protecting American citizens at Guaymas and other Mexican ports during the unrest and disorder which beset Mexico during the struggle between Emperor Maximilian I and Benito Juárez.\n\nIn March 1866, \"Saginaw\" returned to Mare Island. She sailed in August 1866 for Puget Sound to support settlers in the Pacific Northwest. While there, she aided the Western Union Company in laying a cable which brought the first telegraphic service to the region. After returning to Mare Island in December 1866, the ship remained at the navy yard through 1867.\n\nIn April 1868, a year after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia, \"Saginaw\" got underway for the Alaska Territory and, with the exception of a run home late in the year for replenishment, spent the next year exploring and charting the Alaskan coast. In the February 1869 Kake War the \"USS Saginaw\" destroyed three deserted villages and two forts near present-day Kake, Alaska. Prior to the conflict, two white trappers were killed by the Kake in retribution for the death of two Kake departing Sitka village in canoe. Sitka was the site of a standoff between the Army and Tlingit due to the army demanding the surrender of chief Colchika who was involved in an altercation in Fort Sitka. While no Kake, or possibly a single old woman, died in the destruction of the villages, the loss of winter stores, canoes, and shelter led to the death during the winter of some of the Kake.\n\nAfter steaming back to San Francisco Bay in April 1869, \"Saginaw\" departed her home port on 28 July 1869 and operated along the coast of Mexico until arriving back at Mare Island on 11 November 1869.\n\n\"Saginaw\"s next assignment took her to Midway Atoll to support dredging operations to deepen the entrance to the harbor. She reached Midway on 24 March 1870 and completed her task on 21 October 1870. A week later, she sailed for San Francisco, intending to touch at Kure Atoll (at that time known as Ocean Island) en route home to rescue any shipwrecked sailors who might be stranded there. The next day, 29 October 1870, as she neared this rarely visited atoll, \"Saginaw\" struck an outlying reef and grounded. Before the surf battered the ship to pieces, her 93 crew managed to transfer much of her gear and provisions to the atoll.\n\nOn 18 November, a party of five men, headed by Lieutenant John G. Talbot, the executive officer, set out for Honolulu in a small boat to get relief for their stranded shipmates. As they neared Kauai, 31 days and some later, their boat was upset by breakers. Only Coxswain William Halford survived to obtain help. He landed on Kauai, where Captain Dudoit of the schooner \"Wainona\" offered to take him straight to Honolulu leaving his return freight for a later trip. They sailed on Tuesday Dec 20th and arrived at Honolulu on Saturday 24 December and was taken to the United States Consulate there.\n\nThe US Consul authorised the despatch of a fast sailing coaster, the \"Kona Packet\", which departed on Sunday 25 December, and the King of Hawaii, Kamehameha V, sent the inter-island steamer, \"Kilauea\" under Captain Thomas Long, to rescue the shipwrecked sailors. After loading with coal for 2 days and food and copious fresh water they departed on Monday 26 December. The \"Kilauea\" arrived at Kure on 4 January 1871, and the \"Kona Packet\" a day later. Due to uncertainty over the coal required for the return journey they steamed to Midway Island loading 40 tons of coal and left on 7 January, arriving back in Honolulu on 14 January, a round trip of 2350 miles. Captain Long was presented with a heavy gold-cased chronometer watch by the U.S. Government as thanks for successfully undertaking the rescue mission.\n\nThe Saginaw's gig survived being capsized in the breakers, and was sold at auction in January 1871. The purchaser presented it to the rescued crew of the \"Saginaw\", whereupon it was transported back to San Francisco on the \"A.P. Jordan\". It survives as part of the Curator Collection at the Castle Museum of Saginaw County History in Saginaw, Michigan.\n\nThe crew of the \"Saginaw\" may have been aware of the loss of the whaler \"Gledstanes\" on the same reef on 9 July 1837, as they faced the same predicament and constructed a schooner \"Deliverance\" from the wreckage over many months. Captain Brown with 8 men sailed for Hawaii on 15th Dec to secure a rescue ship which took the remaining men off the atoll in February. The wreck of \"Saginaw\" was discovered in 2003 and remains under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command.\n\nThe book \"A Civil War Gunboat in Pacific Waters: Life on Board USS Saginaw\" (by Hans Van Tilburg, University Press of Florida, 2010) covers the ship's construction, her ten years of service in the Pacific, and her loss at Kure Atoll. Van Tilburg led the team which discovered the wreck site in 2003.\n\nThe young readers’ book \"The Wreck of the Saginaw\" (by Keith Robertson, The Viking Press, 1954, 144 pp) tells the story of the voyage of the five sailors who sailed a small boat to Hawaii seeking rescue for the survivors remaining on Kure Atoll. It includes charming illustrations and a map (by Jack Weaver).\n\n\n"}

Bell was appreciated by the company for his \"professionalism, flexibility and dedication to the interests of the fur trade\" as well as his abilities as a \"manager of men\".\n\nIn 1839, he was sent to explore the land west of the Mackenzie River. With the assistance of Alexander Kennedy Isbister, he established Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories on the Peel River not far from the Mackenzie, and explored the Peel into what is now the Yukon Territory.\n\nIn 1845, Bell crossed the mountains into the Yukon River watershed, and went down the Rat River to its confluence with the Porcupine River. The Rat River has been renamed the Bell River in his honour. After managing the fur trade at Fort McPherson until 1845, he returned to the Bell River, and Followed the Porcupine to its juncture with the Yukon River, the eventual site of Fort Yukon. He set the stage for the Yukon trade which proved extremely lucrative for the Hudson's Bay Company and for Canada's claim over what is now the Yukon Territory.\n\nHe had some involvement in organizing John Rae's 1848–1849 expedition to search for Sir John Franklin, and continued working in the Mackenzie District for the Hudson's Bay Company until 1860. Although his exploits as an explorer are most often publicized, Bell preferred to work as a manager and organizer. He accepted the exploring jobs as required but did so \"without the enthusiasm and sense of destiny that inspired other HBC explorers. He was, in fact, a fur trader rather than an explorer, both in talent and temperament.\"\n\nBell completed his career in Quebec, retiring from the company in 1860. He then moved to Saugeen, Ontario and farmed in the area until his death.\n\n"}

{"id": "1998376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998376", "title": "Hastings–Sunrise", "text": "Hastings–Sunrise\n\nHastings–Sunrise is a neighbourhood located in the northeastern corner of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nThe name \"Hastings\" is a common and historical one in Vancouver for roads, businesses and even a townsite. It is commonly thought to have been derived from the Battle of Hastings from the Norman conquest of England in 1066. In fact, it was named in the mid 19th century to commemorate the visit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Navy Rear Admiral George Fowler Hastings of the Royal Navy from 1866–1869.\n\nOne of Vancouver's oldest neighbourhoods, Hastings–Sunrise is primarily residential, with a dense strip of shops and services along East Hastings Street and in pockets along Nanaimo Street, Broadway, Boundary Road and Renfrew Street. The residences are mostly single family detached dwellings, with some multi-family buildings. There is substantial parkland, and the area north of Hastings is partially zoned for light industrial.\n\nHistorically, the area has been primarily working class, with a large immigrant population, mostly Italian-Canadian. More recently, the area has become an attractive location for young professionals and artists, as well as an influx of immigrants from China and other South-East Asian countries.\n\nHastings–Sunrise is bordered by Burrard Inlet to the north, Boundary Road to the east, East Broadway to the south, and Nanaimo Street to the west.\n\nHastings–Sunrise is the northern half of a block of land ear-marked by the Province of British Columbia in the mid-19th century as the future location for a harbour city to complement New Westminster, the town on the Fraser River which was then (in 1863) BC's capital and the terminus city for Western Canada. While Gastown became the shipping destination for the BC coast, New Brighton, as the area was then called, became a popular recreational destination for 19th century New Westminster residents.\n\nThe northern half was re-christened Hastings (officially 'The Hastings Townsite') in 1869 in honour of a visit by Admiral Hastings. The first road, hotel, post office, telephone, real estate transaction, and subdivision in what is now Vancouver were all built at Hastings Townsite. The area's first ferry service between Burrard Inlet and Victoria, also operated from here. The area didn't become part of the City of Vancouver until 1911.\n\nHastings as a resort destination drew vacationers not only to the beachfronts, but also to the Hastings Park racetrack. Local residents lobbied for more 'wholesome' activities and draws, and in 1910 the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) was the result. The PNE leased City land through the Province until 1994, when (again on the basis of local input), the City began to redevelop some of the PNE land into parkland.\n\nBy the 1920s, much of the waterfront was occupied by railyards, wheat pools, and the Port of Vancouver, which continues to be a major employer for the area. There is still public waterfront access at New Brighton Park, near the original Hastings resort site, north of Hastings Park and the PNE.\n\nAccording to the 2001 Census (Vancouver City statistics in brackets), Hastings–Sunrise, with a population of 33,045 residents, is slightly less dense than Vancouver as a whole, at 40.69 people per hectare (47.58). The age demographics of the neighbourhood closely match those of Vancouver City, with both regions having 55.2% of residents under 40 years of age. 41.2% of Hastings–Sunrise residents reported Chinese as their first language (26.4%), with English second at 36.4% (49.4%), and Italian at 7.3% (1.3%).\n\nThe average size of Hastings–Sunrise households is considerably higher than that of Vancouver as a whole, at 3.0 persons (2.3), and while the average household income is less than average, at $53,968 (57,916), the percentage of low income households in the neighbourhood is also slightly below average, at 25.7% (27%).\n\nProvincially, Hastings–Sunrise is part of the Vancouver-Hastings electoral district, and federally it is contained within the riding of Vancouver East. Since Vancouver has an at large civic electoral system, there is no local representation on City Council. The neighbourhood has a history of voting for left of centre parties, and for several successive elections (as of 2013) has been represented both federally and provincially by the left wing New Democratic Party.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1965, it is the largest and oldest community college in British Columbia, with over 140 certificate and diploma programs. VCC has three campuses: Broadway, Downtown, and Annacis Island.\n\nThe college accommodates 26,000 students each year from a variety of nations, about 8 percent of whom are international students.\n\nVancouver Community College was established as Vancouver City College in 1965 through a merger of four local educational institutions: the Vancouver Vocational Institute, the Vancouver School of Art, the Vancouver School Board's Night School Program, and the King Edward Senior Matriculation and Continuing Education Centre. Classes were initially held in the facilities of the King Edward Centre. In 1970, the college opened a campus in the Langara neighbourhood, which became an independent college in 1994.\n\nVancouver City College was renamed as Vancouver Community College in 1974, when it separated from the Vancouver School Board. In 1983, the main campus was moved from the King Edward Centre location at 12th Avenue and Oak Street to its current location at 1155 Broadway, now known as the Broadway campus. The present Downtown campus comprises the former facilities of the Vancouver Vocational Institute.\n\nVancouver Community College has three campuses, two of which are accessible by Vancouver's SkyTrain. The Downtown campus is located at 200-block Dunsmuir at Hamilton (two blocks west of Stadium–Chinatown SkyTrain station). VCC's second campus, known as the Broadway campus, is at 1155 East Broadway, by the VCC–Clark Station. There is also a new (opened in 2014) third campus, it is where VCC's Heavy Mechanical Trades are located. It is shared with VCC/BCIT campus. VCC also has nearly three dozen community outreach and learning centres.\n\nJanuary 2009 marked the opening of VCC's $55 million Broadway campus expansion project. $44 million was funded by the Government of British Columbia and the balance by VCC and community donors. The new building is and seven storeys tall, home to VCC's health sciences training programs.\n\nVancouver Community College is a public institution of post-secondary education administered by a Board of Governors, on behalf of the Government of British Columbia and the Ministry of Advanced Education and Labour Market Development. The board determines policy and reviews the college's performance as detailed in the College and Institutes Act. It also has primary responsibility for fostering the College's short- and long-term success.\n\nThe VCC Board of Directors consists of eight members appointed by government along with the VCC president, the Chair of Education Council and four elected Board members, including one faculty representative, one support staff representative, and two student representatives. VCC was the only institution to hold the distinction of having the support staff representative act as board chair.\n\nCUPE Local 4627 Vancouver Community College Employees' Union (VCCEU), a trade union, not an association, represents approximately 600 support staff at Vancouver Community College and is covered by the CUPE Support Staff Collective Agreement (CUPE Local 4627). CUPE local 4627 workers provide services in: instruction, program assistance, finance, Aboriginal, administrative, bookstore, library, communication, food services, laboratory demonstration, research, IT, print, and media technology. VCCEU was formed in 2003 and represents the technical employees, warehousemen, program assistants and cafeteria workers in the Food Trades division of the VCC. CUPE 4627 held their first strike in November 2012 with 96% support for a strike and successfully ratified a new agreement in March 2013 with no concessions and did not agree to the formulary.\n\nOn February 27, 1951, the Labour Board certified a bargaining unit of instructors, counselors, and librarians in programs conducted by and at Vancouver Vocational Institute. That bargaining unit was called the Vocational Instructors' Association. This unit continues at VCC. The Vancouver Community College Faculty Association (VCCFA) represents approximately 750 instructors, counselors, librarians, and health nurses working in Metro Vancouver. VCCFA is a member of the Federation of Post Secondary Educators of B.C. (FPSE Local 15). Employment for instructors, librarians, counselors, and department heads is covered by the Faculty Association Collective Agreement.\n\nVCC offers career programs leading to one-year certificates, two-year diplomas, and four-year bachelor's degrees in fields such as the arts, business, and trades. The college offers both full-time and part-time programs in spring, summer, and fall terms. Individual courses are also available to supplement high school education or offer continuing education.\n\nMany of Vancouver Community College's programs require students to train in local businesses and facilities to gain practical skills. A number of these are located on campus, open to students and the general public. JJ's Dining Room at the downtown campus, is run by culinary arts students. The Four Corners restaurant and the Seiffert Market are run by VCC hospitality management students. The Broadway and Downtown campuses have several coffee and snack kiosks as well as full-service cafeterias. The VCC salon at the Downtown campus offers hairstyling and esthetics services from students learning in the Hair Design and esthetics programs.\n\nThe Students' Union of Vancouver Community College (SUVCC) was formed in 1974. Based at the Downtown campus, its goal is to provide and encourage access to recreation, events, and opportunities for VCC students. SUVCC also offers students a health and dental plan and low cost access to student services.

{"id": "1998415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998415", "title": "Sweet Emotion", "text": "Sweet Emotion\n\n\"Sweet Emotion\" is a song by the American rock band Aerosmith, released by Columbia Records in April 1975 on the album \"Toys in the Attic\" and was released as a single a month later on May 19. The song began a string of pop hits and large-scale mainstream success for the band that would continue for the remainder of the 1970s. The song was written by lead singer Steven Tyler and bassist Tom Hamilton, produced by Jack Douglas and recorded at the Record Plant.\n\n\"Sweet Emotion\" was released as a single on May 19, 1975, and peaked at #36 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming the band's breakthrough single and their first Top 40 hit. The day it hit #36 on the U.S. chart, July 19, 1975, Aerosmith was booked at a gig in New York City's Central Park, called the Schaefer Music Festival. The song and consequently the album that went into the Top 10 were so successful that the band decided to ride the heels of success and re-release one of their first singles, the power ballad \"Dream On\", which had originally charted at #59 in 1973. The re-released version went on to hit #6, the highest chart performance in the 1970s for the band. \"Sweet Emotion\" remains successful in the modern day, having sold over three million digital downloads.\n\nMany Aerosmith fans believe that Steven Tyler wrote all of the lyrics to the song about the tension and hatred between the band members and Joe Perry's first wife. Tyler himself has said that only some of the lyrics were inspired by Perry's wife. It was stated in Aerosmith's tell-all autobiography \"\" and in an episode of \"Behind the Music\" that growing feuds between the band members' wives (including an incident involving \"spilt milk\" where Elyssa Perry threw milk over Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry) may have helped lead to the band's original lineup dissolving in the early 1980s.\n\nThe line \"Can't catch me / Cause the rabbit done died\" is a reference to the rabbit test.\n\n\"Tom Hamilton wrote the music for 'Sweet Emotion,'\" recalled producer Jack Douglas. \"He had that bassline. And when Joey Kramer came in, he played on the twos and fours instead of the ones and threes, so he was playing on the backside of it. When we heard that, we went, 'Oh, boy! Magic.'\"\n\n\"Sweet Emotion\" is a hard rock song with a repeated electric bass riff tracked alongside the bass marimba, played by Jay Messina in the beginning. Steven Tyler shakes a packet of sugar in place of maracas, as none were available. The introduction builds with the use of a talk box by Joe Perry, which has become one of the most famous uses of the guitar talk box in popular music (Perry's guitar \"sings\" the line \"sweet emotion\" over Hamilton's bass riff). Eventually Tyler joins in, singing in unison with Perry's talk box. The talk box device used was called The Bag, made by Kustom Electronics. The now discontinued device had been used by guitarists including Jeff Beck and Mike Pinera.\n\nThe song kicks into a more rocking rhythm with dueling guitars, and rapid-fire angry-sounding lyrics sung by Tyler. The chorus consists of a repeating guitar riff followed by a mirror of the \"sweet emotion\" intro.\n\nOn the 1980 compilation \"Aerosmith's Greatest Hits\", \"Sweet Emotion\" appears in edited form. The bass and talk box introduction is removed, and the track begins with the chorus that precedes the first verse. The guitar solo at the end of the song is also removed, and the track concludes with the chorus, which repeats as the song fades. This edit was used for the original single release of the song, which was replaced in subsequent pressings with the album version from \"Toys in the Attic\".\n\n\nThe song has been included on almost every Aerosmith compilation and live album, including \"Aerosmith's Greatest Hits\", \"Pandora's Box\", \"Pandora's Toys\", \"O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits\", \"\", \"Live! Bootleg\", \"Classics Live I\", \"A Little South of Sanity\", \"Greatest Hits 1973–1988\" and \"Rockin' the Joint\".\n\nThe song is frequently cited as Aerosmith's signature song, including in the \"World Almanac and Book of Facts\", and regularly competes with \"Dream On\" and \"Walk This Way\" for the title of Aerosmith's \"signature song\" elsewhere.\n\nIt is often included on \"greatest song\" lists or \"greatest rock song\" lists, including a ranking of No. 408 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nIt appears in a 2019 TV commercial for T Mobile promoting the sale of the iPhone 11. \n\nIn film, the song was featured in \"War Dogs\" , “Dazed and Confused” and \"We're the Millers\".\n\nThe original recording was remixed by David Thoener and released as a single in 1991 in coordination with the release of the band's box set \"Pandora's Box\", although the remixed version was not in the box set. The difference from the original is that the drums are mixed louder with more reverb, the instrumental segue between verses is twice as long and the same as the segue between the 2nd and 4th verses and their subsequent choruses, and a guitar harmony has been added at the fade-out. A new music video was filmed and released in support of the single. The re-released version reached #36 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and #74 in the United Kingdom. The remixed version was later issued on the soundtrack to the 1998 film \"Armageddon\".\n\nThe video for the re-released version is based on a phone sex conversation. The video, directed by Marty Callner, shows a young man under his covers with a magazine which is advertising a phone sex line. The young man, who says he is a 26-year-old attorney, and the phone sex operator talk about each other for a while, until it goes into a shot of the band performing in a basement (this portion of the video was actually recorded in an old warehouse in the Charlestown Navy Yard, which substituted as the band's old apartment on 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston). It switches back-and-forth between Aerosmith performing \"Sweet Emotion\" and the phone conversation. At the very end, both the phone sex operator and the young man are shown to be very different from each other's perceptions; she is an overweight older woman with a baby living in a run down house, and he is a teenage boy. Throughout most of the video, Perry is playing a Gibson Les Paul but plays the solo on a Fender Stratocaster.\n\nThe video is also a homage to the 1983 film \"Risky Business\", in that the opening scenes of the young man talking to the woman are almost identical to the scenes in the film of Tom Cruise's character talking on the phone to the call girl.\n\n"}

The novel includes some characters who cross over from Rice's \"Lives of the Mayfair Witches\" trilogy (1990–1994).\n\nLouis de Pointe du Lac is being haunted by the spirit of Claudia, a child who, like Louis, had been turned into a vampire by Lestat de Lioncourt but was destroyed long ago. With the help of former Talamasca leader-turned-vampire David Talbot, Louis asks the beautiful witch Merrick Mayfair to use her spiritual powers to contact Claudia's ghost. \n\nMerrick is also a former agent of the Talamasca, and shared many adventures with David in the past. Flashbacks introduce Merrick's malevolent sister, Honey Isabella or Honey in the Sunshine; Merrick's mother, Cold Sandra; and the Great Nananne, a powerful witch whose very presence is enough to frighten and instill respect in David. Merrick and David recall their journey to a cave in Central America which contained malevolent spirits protecting an ancient jade mask, which allows people to see spirits as if they were corporeal.\n\nMerrick retrieves Claudia's diary from the Talamasca vaults, and makes it possible for Louis to speak with Claudia. The spirit's harsh words confirm the negative feelings for Louis that Claudia expressed in her diary, and a despairing Louis attempts suicide by exposing himself to the sun. Made a vampire by Lestat, Louis is too powerful to be destroyed in this manner, and his burned body is restored with vampiric blood bestowed by Lestat, David, and new vampire Merrick. She reveals that from the beginning, she used her magic to lure David and Louis to her in hopes of receiving the Dark Gift of vampirism. The turning of Merrick into a vampire infuriates the Talamasca, but in a letter David advises that they not wage war against the vampires because Lestat is too formidable a foe.\n\nSome characters from from Rice's \"Lives of the Mayfair Witches\" trilogy (1990–1994) appear in \"Merrick\", and later \"Blackwood Farm\" (2002) and \"Blood Canticle\" (2003).\n\nIn 2000, Penguin Random House Audio released an abridged audiobook adaptation of \"Merrick\", narrated by Derek Jacobi, as well as an unabridged version, narrated by Graeme Malcolm.\n\n\"Merrick\" debuted at No. 2 on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, and remained in that position for two weeks, spending a total of 10 weeks on the list. \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote, \"This volume merges several long-running plots; the first chapters sag with the weight of their exposition, and the prose seems overheated even for Rice ... Displaying her imaginative talents for atmosphere and suspense, Rice creates a riveting scene that shows Merrick's awesome magic at work.\"\n"}

The University is named after Chief Joe Capilano Sa7plek (Sahp-luk) who was the leader of the Squamish people (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh) from 1895–1910.\n\nIn 2018, the University marked its 50th anniversary since opening in 1968 with a birthday message from the Prime Minister of Canada who remarked “CapU has empowered thousands of Canadians and people from around the world. Your alumni are artists of all kinds and educators and executives in every field. Above all, they’re leaders.”\n\nCapilano University's degree programs are approved by the Government of British Columbia’s Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. The degree-granting powers of the University are legislated by British Columbia's University Act. In 2012, CapU became Canada's first university to receive accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (or NWCCU) in Washington (state), one of six major regional agencies in the U.S. that are recognized by the United States Department of Education.\n\nCapilano University's sports teams, \"The Blues\", have won 14 national titles in the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association, and 59 provincial titles in the Pacific Western Athletic Association.\n\nThe University was originally founded as Capilano College by school boards and residents of the North Shore (Greater Vancouver) and Howe Sound in 1968 based on the need for a public institution serving the local communities immediately northwest of Vancouver. Initial enrollment was 784 students. In 2008, the province changed Capilano College's designation to a university and, as of 2019, it has grown to enroll approximately 12,700 students per year. Capilano University's academic offerings include nationally and internationally recognized liberal arts, professional, and career programs which lead to degrees, diplomas, and certificates.\n\nThe University's reputation rests on its smaller class sizes of 25-35 students which provide for more personalized teaching and learning. In 2018, conjointly with BC Stats (the provincial government's leader in statistical and economic research, information and analysis), the  BC Student Outcomes Research Forum (which represents the interests of British Columbia's Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training, and all of the participating post-secondary institutions) found that 97 per cent of bachelor's degree students at Capilano University were satisfied with their education, one of the top two ratings in the Province of British Columbia.\n\nIn having aligned its program offerings with the BC Skills for Jobs Blueprint to ensure that students are career-ready for the most in-demand jobs when they graduate, CapU has a 96 per cent job placement rating amongst its graduates of bachelor's degree programs.\n\nThe school boards of North and West Vancouver, Howe Sound and Sechelt formed a committee to determine the need for a community college to serve the region. The proposal to build a college on the North Shore passed by a plebiscite in North and West Vancouver and the Howe Sound in 1968. The provincial government granted approval, and Capilano College had its name selected from submissions made by North Shore residents, in honour of Chief Joe Capilano of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Coast Salish nation. Capilano College opened on September 10, 1968 with 784 students attending classes after hours at West Vancouver Secondary. The Capilano College Foundation was created in 1970 to provide scholarships and bursaries for students.\n\nIn 1970, construction began on the North Vancouver campus in the Lynnmour area. Three years later, the permanent North Vancouver campus opened with 1,965 students in attendance. The first vocational programs were offered in portable buildings brought from West Vancouver Secondary. The first permanent structure at the North Vancouver campus, the original library building, also opened. In 1975 Capilano College opened the Squamish Learning Centre and Community Information Services at 38038 Cleveland Avenue in Squamish. In 1976, the Arbutus building opened at the North Vancouver campus and the Fir building opened in 1982. In 1991, the Cedar building, the Sportsplex, and Horticulture building were completed. Two years later, a new library replaced the former at the North Vancouver campus, tripling the size of existing library space. In 1996, the Birch building at the North Vancouver campus was completed, housing a performance theatre, classrooms, student services, and teaching space. The Child Care Centre also opened the same year. With regards to its satellite locations, the University opened the Capilano kálax-ay Sunshine Coast campus in Sechelt in 1977, and the CapU Lonsdale location in 2019.\n\nCapilano College offered its first bachelor degree, a collaborative degree in music therapy, with the British Columbia Open University in 1990 and added a second music degree in jazz studies in 1992. Business administration degrees were first offered in 1993. That year, Capilano College also conferred its first associate degrees, which are now available to students in a variety of subject areas from Interdisciplinary Arts, Creative Writing, English, Global Stewardship, Psychology, Interdisciplinary Sciences and Biology. The College was authorized by the provincial government in 2003 to become the first college in British Columbia to independently grant applied degrees after the dissolution of the B.C. Open University. In 2004, Capilano College was also named by the provincial government as host of the British Columbia Centre for Tourism Leadership and Innovation, in preparations for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Centre addressed tourism issues, helped provide tourism education, and was part of the larger British Columbia Tourism and Hospitality Education and Training Consortium. In 2008, the centre was merged into Link BC, an education network for tourism and hospitality with industry organizations which resulted in partnerships with organizations and opportunities for students. In 2008, the provincial government changed Capilano College's designation to Capilano University. CapU also joined the OpenCourseWare consortium, and began the process for accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (which it received in 2012).\n\nCapilano University's main campus is located at 2055 Purcell Way in North Vancouver (district municipality), on Metro Vancouver's North Shore. It is approximately a 30-minute drive from Downtown Vancouver. The majority of the programs are offered at this campus. There is also a smaller regional campus, referred to as the kálax-ay Sunshine Coast Campus in Sechelt, British Columbia that serves the communities of the Sunshine Coast. In September 2019, CapU welcomed students to CapU Lonsdale, the University's newest location, the iconic Shipyards Development in North Vancouver's Lower Lonsdale. \n\nThe University also runs the Early Childhood Education programs in Squamish, British Columbia, and holds classes at the Ts̓zil Learning Centre in Mount Currie, British Columbia.\n\nCapilano University is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, Musqueam, Lil'wat and Sechelt (shíshálh) Nations.\n\nCapilano university offers 97 programs through 5 faculties: the Faculty of Arts & Sciences; the Faculty of Business & Professional Studies; the Faculty of Education, Health & Human Development; the Faculty of Fine & Applied Arts; and the Faculty of Global & Community Studies.\n\nWithin the Faculty of Arts & Sciences, there is the School of Social Sciences (with programs in Arts, Academic Studies, Applied Behaviour Analysis (Autism), Psychology, and Liberal Studies); the School of Humanities (with programs in Arts, Creative Writing, English, Liberal Studies, and Lil'wat Nation, Sechelt, or Squamish Nation Language and Cultural Studies); and the School of Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics or STEM (with programs in Biology, Science, Engineering, and Health Career Pathways).\n\nThe Faculty of Business & Professional Studies includes is the School of Business (with programs in Accounting, Business Administration, Advanced Business Administration, and Retail Business); the School of Communication; and the School of Legal Studies (with programs in Legal Studies - Paralegal, Contract Law, and Legal Administration).\n\nThe Faculty of Education, Health & Human Development includes the School of Access & Academic Preparation (with programs in College and University Preparation, Community Capacity Building, Community Leadership and Social Change, Education and Employment Access, English for Academic Purposes, and University One for Aboriginal Learners); the School of Allied Health (with programs in Music Therapy, Health Care, and Rehabilitation); and the School of Education & Childhood Studies (with programs in Early Childhood Care and Education, Education Assistant and subspecialties in Infants and Toddlers as well as Special Needs).\n\nIts Faculty of Fine & Applied Arts offers the IDEA School of Design (programs in Visual Communication); the School of Motion Picture Arts (with programs in Motion Picture Arts, Costuming for Stage and Screen, Indigenous Independent Digital Filmmaking, Lighting for Digital Imaging and Film, Grip Work for Digital Imaging and Film, 2D Animation & Visual Development, 3D Animation for Film and Games, Animation Fundamentals, and Digital Visual Effects); and the School of Performing Arts (with programs in Acting for Stage and Screen, Advanced Arts & Entertainment Management, Performing Arts, Music, Conducting in Music, Music Therapy, Musical Theatre, Technical Theatre, and Jazz Studies with subspecialties in Education and/or Performance/Composition).\n\nThe Faculty of Global & Community Studies offers the School of Global Stewardship; the School of Human Kinetics; the School of Outdoor Recreation Management; the School of Public Administration (with programs in Local Government Administration, Advanced Local Government Administration and Local Government Leadership Development); and the School of Tourism Management (with programs in Tourism Management, Global Hospitality & Tourism Management, Tourism Management Co-operative Education, Tourism Management for International Students, and Tourism Marketing).\n\nCapilano University offers joint partnerships and projects as part of the university's commitment to international education.

The residences are located on Dollarton Highway, 10 minutes from main campus.\n\nThe real estate development company, Woodbridge Northwest Communities, is proposing a Capilano University Village including a six-floor condominium tower, three and four-floor townhouses, 60 dormitories for CapU students, and an amenities building at the North Vancouver campus. The company's plan also includes personalized student kitchens, a swimming pool, clubhouse and children's play area.\n\nAnother North Vancouver developer is offering to build rental apartments exclusively for Capilano University's students and staff. Darwin Properties has submitted an application to build 346 units of rental housing in two six-storey buildings. The company also wants to build an adjacent cafe.\n\nThe nearby Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites near main campus offers discounts for students who seek temporary accommodation.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1999, the Capilano Blues won the CCAA Soccer Supremacy Award for both men's and women's soccer. To date, Capilano teams have won 14 CCAA National Titles and 59 TOTEM/BCCAA/PACWEST Provincial Championships.\n\nCapilano University has six men's and women's varsity sports teams, the Capilano Blues, that play at the provincial and national levels. The Blues are based at Capilano University's Centre for Sport and Wellness on main campus.\n\n\nCapilano Students' Union\n\nEvery student enrolled in a credit program at Capilano University is a member of the Capilano Students' Union (CSU). The CSU is the resident student society of Capilano University and benefits the university and the community by advancing the interests of students. Like other student societies in British Columbia, the CSU's mandate is to advocate for students and provide services and events that improve the student experience. While the day-to-day management and operations are entrusted to a board of directors composed of elected students, governed by the constitution and bylaws of the society, students are ultimately in control of the activities of the CSU. The board of directors consists of five vice-presidents, seven liaisons representing special interest groups, two representatives for each faculty, four senate representatives, and two representatives to the university's board of governors. The CSU is registered under the Society Act of B.C. and receives funding from membership fees, collected from students by the university in accordance with the \"University Act\".\n\nThe CSU provides services to its members, including a low-cost transit pass, free day planner, a used book sale, and health and dental benefits. Student interests are represented by the CSU, and the views of students are presented and advocated for in meetings with university administrators and representatives of local, provincial and federal governments. The student society also promotes the development of the campus community and improves the student experience by hosting events and supporting the development of student clubs and associations.\n\nIn 2019, internationally acclaimed singer and songwriter Sarah McLachlan received the degree of Doctor of Fine Arts, honoris causa from Capilano University, and expressed her strong appreciation for CapU's values in \"striving to become a diverse and progressive student-centred place of learning.\" In 2018, a short film made by Malibu Taetz, a Motion Picture Arts graduate, was included in the Short Film Corner at the Cannes Film Festival which was the second time a CapU graduate received this honour. In 2017, seven alumni from the jazz program and two faculty members were nominated for Juno Awards while other alumni have worked on Oscar-winning animated films like Disney's Zootopia.

One of his most popular early singles, \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\" was the first Stevie Wonder hit single to be co-written by the artist.\n\nA notable success, \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\" peaked at number 3 on the \"Billboard\" Pop Singles chart in early 1966, at the same time reaching the top of the \"Billboard\" R&B Singles chart for five weeks. \"Billboard\" ranked it as the 59th biggest American hit of 1966. An accompanying album, \"Up-Tight\" (1966), was rushed into production to capitalize on the single's success. It also garnered Wonder his first two career Grammy Award nominations for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance.\n\nThe single was a watershed in Wonder's career for several reasons. Aside from the US number-one \"Fingertips\" (1963), only two of Wonder's singles, \"Workout, Stevie, Workout\" (1963) and \"Hey Harmonica Man\" (1964) had both peaked inside of the top forty of the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, peaking at #33 and #29 on that chart respectively. And despite receiving a modicum of chart success, the then 15-year-old Wonder was in danger of being let go. In addition, Wonder's voice had begun to change, and Motown CEO Berry Gordy was worried that he would no longer be a commercially viable artist.\n\nAs it turned out, however, producer Clarence Paul found it easier to work with Wonder's now-mature tenor voice, and Sylvia Moy and Henry Cosby set about writing a new song for the artist, based upon an instrumental riff Wonder had devised. Nelson George, in \"Where Did Our Love Go? The Rise and Fall of the Motown Sound\", recorded that Wonder had also sought something based on the driving beat of the Rolling Stones's \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\", after playing several dates with the Stones on tour and being impressed with the British band. As Wonder presented his ideas, finished or not, \"he went through everything,\" remembered Moy. \"I asked, 'Are you sure you don't have anything else?' He started singing and playing 'Everything is alright, uptight.' That was as much as he had. I said, 'That's it. Let's work with that.'\" The resulting song, \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\", features lyrics which depict a poor young man's appreciation for a rich girl's seeing beyond his poverty to his true worth.\n\nOn the day of the recording, Moy had completed the lyrics, but didn't have them in Braille for Wonder to read, and so sang the song to him as he was recording it. She sang a line ahead of him, and he simply repeated the lines as he heard them. In 2008, Moy commented that \"he never missed a beat\" during the recording.\n\n\nA note-for-note re-recording of Wonder's version was used as the backing track for Bill Cosby's 1967 musical comedy single, \"Little Ole Man (Uptight, Everything's Alright)\" which was a US#4 hit. Bill Cosby is not related to the song's co-writer Henry Cosby.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1998495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998495", "title": "Public Security Section 9", "text": "Public Security Section 9\n\nThe Section-9 is composed of former military officers, forensics scientists, and police detectives; these agents answer only to the Chief Director and the Prime Minister of Japan. Most information about Section 9 remains highly classified; the Ministry of Home Affairs does not comment on the details of its activities. The public at large is unaware that Section 9 even exists, though the National Diet and other security forces sections are generally aware of them as a black operation unit. This allows Section-9 to operate independently from governmental oversight, cutting through red tape and bureaucracy.\n\nMany of Section-9's functions are unique, its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the American FBI, the British MI5 and the Russian FSB. Their structure was based on the German GSG-9. Due to cross-training exercises in the past with the British SAS's 22nd Regiment, which also included personnel exchanges, Section 9's structure has been partially influenced by the British SAS.\n\nPublic Security Section 9 was established as a search and rescue organization; it has evolved to meet the demands of world characterized by a blurring of the lines—between war and politics, combatants and civilians, crime and terrorism—have become increasingly irrelevant. Officially billed as an international organization, it is actually a counter-terrorist network and anti-crime unit operating in the Japanese National Public Safety Commission. Its operatives are allowed to act with or without government consent as they are almost unknown to the public eye. In particular, Section 9 and its members are among the best counter-fourth generation cyberwarfare operatives in the country, and as a result usually end up involved in cybercrime cases relating to cybernetic lifeforms and the Internet, such as hacking and cyberterrorism. Even though Section 9 team is the \"crème de la crème\" of military prowess, there is a competitiveness with the other Section teams as well.\n\nMajor Motoko Kusanagi is dispatched by Section 9 to spy on a building in New Port City. A foreign power conspires to recruit a domestic programmer to fix the Project 2501 \"bug.\" The team moves in while Major activates her thermoptic camouflage. The foreign official refuses to return the programmer, while Kusanagi moves in and kills him.\n\nDuring the investigation of the Laughing Man case, Major Kusanagi poses as the Laughing Man in order to uncover a conspiracy against Serano Genomics, a nanotechnology (micro machine) company by the Japanese government. After higher-ranking government officials uncover information about the Section 9 investigation, the government disbands the agency and declares war on them.\n\nIn preparation for an attack on their headquarters by the Umibozu's shock troopers and their Type 303 Armed Suit robots, all remaining Section 9 members barricade themselves into the building and fight the invaders with heavy weaponry. Failing that, they assemble a diversion and escape through a passage in the sewers of New Port City. They are all eventually captured, with the Major apparently killed.\n\nTogusa spends the next three months wondering what happened to the rest of Section 9 before encountering Batou. The whole thing turns out to have been Aramaki's plan, sacrificing Section 9 in order to leave the prime suspect wide-open to arrest, investigation, and prosecution. Everyone, including the Major is fine, and Aramaki is in the process of rebuilding and securing funding for the newly-reborn Section 9, which happens in \"\".\n\nThe second season starts with Section 9 non-existent in an official capacity due to an amendment to the Special Forces Bill. The first episode involves a hostage situation in which nine terrorists, who call themselves the Individual Eleven, are holed up in the Chinese Embassy, demanding a swift change in the Refugee Action Policy. They demand the freedom of the refugees from the stand point that refugees drain the country. The previous PM of Japan issued a temporary bill that allowed for the entrance of refugees into certain zones, but the bill was never repealed. Because the new PM, Kayabuki, plans to repeal the policy soon, she has to act quickly on the terrorists before their demands become known in order to ensure it doesn't appear that she was caving in to terrorist pressure.\n\nSection 9 is promised full reestablishment, and the approval of their new budget proposal that includes the reinstatement of think tanks (Tachikomas), on the condition that there are no hostage casualties in the process of stopping the terrorists before the press blackout runs out. From this point on the 2nd season goes on to focus on the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, along with providing additional background information on almost all of the characters.\n\nA new group emerges in this season, The Individual Eleven. This group first appears in the premiere episode as a group of Individual Eleven \"copycats\" take hostages in the Chinese Embassy. Later in the series it is revealed that the Individual Eleven's true intentions were to harm the wellbeing of refugees that had taken shelter in Japan at the end of World War IV. This group destroys itself in a public display of mutually assisted suicide among the members. Only one survives, Hideo Kuze, who then sides with the refugees and confounds Section 9 as to his motives.\n\nSection 9 is radically reformed after the Major leaves in order to pursue investigations of her own. The section has increased in size, and is now run by Togusa because Batou declined the position. Solid State Society initially focuses on the cyberbrain suicides of members of a terrorist organization that gained asylum in Japan. This case leads to the discovery that around twenty thousand children may have been abducted. The mastermind behind the crimes is known as \"The Puppeteer,\" and is classified as a Super Wizard Class Hacker.\n\n\"\" is an alternate universe telling of the formation of Section 9. Major Kusanagi, an ex-army hacker, is recruited by Aramaki and charged with putting together a team to deal with high level hacking threats. Over the course of the series, while pursuing her own personal investigation, she encounters and works with (sometimes double crossed by) all of the original team members. At the end of the series she offers them positions on her team. A notable change is that Togusa is involved from the beginning rather than being recruited some time after the team's formation.\n\nAccording to Tawanda Manyimo, part of what makes the Section 9 group so interesting is they aren't controlled by the government. \"We are able to cut through red tape and bureaucracy it seems,\" he said \"Who doesn’t want that? We can actually just do what we want, in essence. And we answer to essentially to Aramaki and the Major, so we’re almost a rogue renegade, but not quite. And I think that’s a unique position because in the world, there is a lot of political intrigue.\"\n\nPublic Security Section 9 is located in the fictional Japanese city of Niihama-shi (also known as New Port City). The exact location of Section 9's headquarters is held as top-secret and is only known by the Japanese government and Section 9 employees. Their building is known to the public as a false security company.\n\nSection 9 Headquarters facilities include a rooftop helipad, underground car park, Operator-managed control room, cyber-warfare and information gathering room, holding cells, meeting rooms and Tachikoma/Fuchikoma/Uchikoma workshop.\n\nSection 9's operatives are versatile, quiet professionals: trained in various methods ranging from criminal investigation, cybercrime-criminology, and digital forensics to unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, information operations, cyberwarfare, counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, direct action and special operations.\n"}

Approximately 50 km northwest of Vancouver, it is accessible from mainland British Columbia by a 40-minute ferry trip between Horseshoe Bay and Langdale, and a 25-minute drive from Langdale along Highway 101, also known as the Sunshine Coast Highway. The name \"Sechelt\" is derived from the Sechelt language word, \"shishalh,\" the name of the First Nations people who first settled the area thousands of years ago.\n\nThe original Village of Sechelt was incorporated on February 15, 1956. Sechelt later expanded its boundaries in 1986 with the inclusion of a number of adjacent unincorporated areas. The District of Sechelt, as it is known today, encompasses some 39.71 km² (15.33 sq mi) at the isthmus of the Sechelt Peninsula, between the southern tip of Sechelt Inlet (Porpoise Bay) and the Strait of Georgia that separates the provincial mainland from Vancouver Island.\n\nSechelt is a seaside community with approx. 35 kilometers of Pacific Ocean shoreline that extends primarily along the coastline of the Sunshine Coast, and is bounded to the west and east by the unincorporated communities of Halfmoon Bay and Roberts Creek, respectively. The 2016 Canadian census placed its population at 10,200. Sechelt is the seat of the Sunshine Coast Regional District of British Columbia.\n\nAlthough its population is relatively small for its geographical area, Sechelt has several distinct neighbourhoods. From east to west, they are Wilson Creek, Davis Bay, Selma Park, the original Village of Sechelt, and West Sechelt. Several neighbourhoods around Sechelt Inlet were also included in Sechelt's 1986 incorporation as a district; these include West Porpoise Bay, East Porpoise Bay, Sandy Hook, Tillicum Bay and Tuwanek. The municipal government of the Shishalh First Nation, which contains a substantial commercial district, is immediately east of Sechelt's \"downtown\" village.\n\nThe original inhabitants of Sechelt are the Sechelt Nation, a British Columbian First Nations band who call themselves \"shishalh\" (or \"shishalh\" Nation). Before English was spoken, the town of Sechelt was called \"ch'atlich\" in \"she shashishalhem\" (the Sechelt language). For thousands of years, the Sechelt people practiced a hunting and gathering subsistence strategy, making extensive use of the natural food resources located around Sechelt, and its strategic location for access into the Sechelt Inlet.\n\nEuropeans began settling in Sechelt in the 1860s and by the 1880s, it had become an active centre of the logging and fishing industries with the construction of sawmills and wharves. With sustained contact with European settlers, the Sechelt people's semi-nomadic way of life began to be substituted for a more sedentary life in Sechelt, a change heavily influenced by the establishment of a Roman Catholic church by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. Our Lady of the Rosary was completed in 1890 and cost the Sechelt people a sum of $8,000 to construct. In 1906, this church was destroyed in a fire, and a year later another church was erected in its place called Our Lady of Lourdes but this too was also destroyed by fire in October, 1970.\n\nThe natural beauty of the Sunshine Coast soon attracted tourists, who arrived at the wharves at Trail Bay via steamship. The construction of the original provincial highway in 1952, Highway 101, now also known as Sunshine Coast Highway, and the accompanying commencement of ferry service to Horseshoe Bay (near Vancouver) and Powell River (hence to Vancouver Island) accelerated tourism and residential growth, which continues today. .\n\nSechelt is a municipality on the Sunshine Coast, west northwest of Vancouver BC. Sechelt is located on an isthmus, a narrow strip of land that bridges between the Sechelt Peninsula and the BC mainland. This isthmus is bounded on the north by the Sechelt Inlet, and on the south by the Strait of Georgia. \n\nSechelt's climate is Cfb (Temperate Oceanic) according to the Köppen climate classification, and is designated as Plant Hardiness Zone 8a by Environment Canada. It has the warmest nights in Canada.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, most residents of the municipality are over 45; and, indeed, Sechelt has become increasingly attractive to retirees from across Canada. Perhaps as a result, new upscale subdivisions and smaller residential developments have grown significantly in recent years.\nStatistics Canada recorded the population of Sechelt as 10,200 in 2016 which is a 10% growth from the previous 2011 census.\n\nThe village itself, the original locus of Sechelt, includes Clayton's Heritage Market (a grocery store named after its pioneering family owners) in Trail Bay Mall. A new public library with municipal hall opened in 1997, and a combined provincial courthouse and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) building, and a public recreation aquatic centre serving Sechelt and the surrounding area, have also been completed since that time.\n\nImmediately to the east of the downtown village are the Sechelt or s\"hishalh\" First Nation Band Lands, containing a shopping centre, movie theatre, museum, gift shop and one of the largest open-pit gravel quarries in North America.\n\nOther Sechelt area landmarks include:\n\n\nLike other parts of the Sunshine Coast, Sechelt is known for its natural beauty, and is a popular destination for outdoor activities that include kayaking, diving, snowshoeing and skiing, hiking and backpacking, camping and mountain biking. There is an 18-hole public golf course, and a number of small marinas are available around Sechelt Inlet. Sechelt has several municipal parks, and larger provincial parks are nearby.\n\nAuto enthusiasts come from around the Pacific Northwest for Sechelt's annual Sleepy Hollow Rod Run, and the \"Show and Shine\" held in conjunction with the August drag races at Sechelt Airport.\n\nThe Hidden Groves area of old growth forest adjoins the Sandy Hook neighbourhood, 6 km from downtown Sechelt and 2 km from Porpoise Bay Provincial Park. It has trails for walkers and hikers of various abilities, from easy walks of around 15 minutes to more strenuous treks of 3 or 4 kilometres. A wheelchair-accessible trail of 480 metres into the Ancient Grove area is also suitable for people with walkers, mothers with strollers, and those not so fit. A second 400-metre accessibility trail loops from the entrance kiosk through pristine forest and back.\n\nThe entrance kiosk features a large map of the trails. All trails are well-marked and maintained. There are signs at all intersections with directions, maps and guides.\n\nThe Groves includes giant ancient trees, maple wetland, and rocky promontories with views of Vancouver Island and Sechelt Inlet. There is parking at the entrance to the trails. It is a legal off-leash area for dogs.\n\nThe Sechelt Heritage Forest portion of the Groves is a protected interpretive forest as designated by the Province. Hidden Grove is currently part of the BC Forest and under a special tenure to the Sechelt Community Forest, which has declared the Grove a special high-priority recreational area and mandated it shall not be logged. Volunteers provide daily maintenance.\n\nPorpoise Bay Provincial Park is some 4 km north of downtown Sechelt, on the east side of Sechelt Inlet. It is characterized by second-growth forest, open grassy areas and sandy beaches.\n\nThe School District 46 Sunshine Coast operates public schools in the region.\n\nThe \"Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique\" operates two Francophone schools in that city: the \"école du Pacifique\" primary school and \"école secondaire Chatelech\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was usually held by a relative of the king and was the rough equivalent of the 19th-century European office of Prime Minister or sometimes Regent.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the office of \"Kuhina Nui\" by Kamehameha, there was a position called Kālaimoku (\"kālai\" meaning \"to carve\" and \"moku\" being an island). This was an ancient office from the very dawn of Hawaiian civilization. During this time before the \"Kuhina Nui\" Kalanimoku, a trusted chief of Kamehameha, was the Kālaimoku until Kamehameha established the office of the \"Kuhina Nui\".\nWhen King Kamehameha II assumed the throne in 1819, his father's favorite wife, Queen Kaʻahumanu, told him Kamehameha I had wished for her to rule the kingdom alongside him. Whether this was really the will of Kamehameha I is a matter of debate. In either case, Kamehameha II did not object and the office of \"Kuhina Nui\" was created for Kaʻahumanu. According to other sources, Kamehameha I had wanted Kaʻahumanu to succeed her father Keʻeaumoku Pāpaʻiahiahi as chief counselor.\n\nKaʻahumanu became the driving force behind the kingdom’s policy during the reign of Kamehameha II. She and another one of Kamehameha I's wives, Keōpūolani, pressured Kamehameha II into abolishing the old kapu system of laws and religion.\n\nAt the death of Kamehameha II in 1824, his younger brother and heir Kauikeaouli was still only a child. Because of this, Kaʻahumanu ruled in his place as regent. After her death in 1832, a queen named Kīnaʻu, a daughter of Kamehameha I and the Dowager Queen of Kamehameha II, assumed the office of Kuhina Nui as Kaʻahumanu II and the regency until her half-brother Kauikeaouli declared himself to be of age in 1833. Kauikeaouli was crowned King Kamehameha III thereafter and the office of Kuhina Nui became the second-most powerful office in the kingdom.\n\nDuring Kīnaʻu's time in office, the offices of the king and Kuhina Nui often battled for power. This was mainly due to conflict between the views of the two people holding the office. While Kamehameha III desired a revival of the old Hawaiian culture, his elder sister Kīnaʻu wanted Hawaiʻi to be a Protestant state which tolerated no other religion. For the first few years of Kamehameha III’s reign, the kingdom suffered from the frequent quarrels between Kīnaʻu and the king.\n\nThe 1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii codified the office of Kuhina Nui into law. The constitution specified the following duties and powers:\n\n\nThe 1840 Constitution created a degree of power sharing between the King and Kuhina Nui. Both were given seats in the House of Nobles in the legislature and both also held seats in the kingdom's judiciary. \nThe position was written into a constitution devised by American attorneys and missionaries. In the United States, women held no political offices, were denied suffrage, and in some states could not even control their inherited property. Yet the Americans William Richards, John Ricord, and William Little Lee all believed it was appropriate to reinforce the power and authority of the Kuhina Nui as an equivalent to the King despite the fact it had become a traditional female office.\n\nThe 1852 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii dedicated a full section (Section 2) to the office of Kuhina Nui. Articles 43 through 48 described the office:\n\n\nThe power sharing scheme set in place by Kamehameha III in 1852 seemed to work and it remained in place throughout the remainder of Kamehameha III's reign and throughout the reign of Kamehameha IV. Kamehameha IV and his brother despised the position but Kamehameha IV did place the role upon his sister, Victoria Kamamalu. Mostly she just signed and approved papers to the wishes of her brothers. When Kamehameha V assumed the throne in 1863, however, the new king made it clear that he favored a more autocratic monarchy over the constitutional one set in place in 1852. In 1864, the King issued a new constitution that was much less liberal than the Constitution of 1852. The 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii abolished the office of Kuhina Nui and effectively merged the powers into his own office as King.

{"id": "1998515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998515", "title": "JTD engine", "text": "JTD engine\n\nMultijet is Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' term for its current common rail direct injection turbodiesel engine range. Most of the Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia range as well as certain Chrysler, RAM Trucks, Jeep and Maserati vehicles are equipped with Multijet engines. Ownership of some Fiat Multijet designs is shared with General Motors as part of a settlement of the failed merger between the two auto conglomerates. GM Powertrain Torino group in Turin, Italy manages their interest in these engines. Some PSA Peugeot Citroën diesel engines are also rebadged JTD units, and vice versa. Fiat's common rail diesel engine is also known as JTD, an initialism of Jet Turbo Diesel.\n\nThe property that distinguishes the Multijet from previous generations of common rail diesel engines from FCA is the combustion of the fuel, which is split into multiple injections, thus allowing for a more complete, quieter combustion in the cylinder. Compared to the first-generation JTD engines (Unijet system) which only featured a smaller pilot and a larger main injection, Multijet is capable of up to five injections per combustion cycle which enables better, more efficient cold running, better performance especially in the lower rev-range, quieter operation as well as even lower consumptions and emissions. The time between injections has been reduced to 150 microseconds while the minimal injection quantity has been reduced from two to less than one microlitre.\n\nThis enables even mid-sized sedans like the Alfa Romeo 156 and Lancia Lybra equipped with the 1.9 JTD to achieve fuel economy upwards of 45 mpg (55 mpg or 5L/100 km) on country roads and highways while offering an equal amount of torque as the 3.0L 24V V6 engine.\n\nA sophisticated electronic control unit controls the injection and changes the injection logic and number of injections based on a multitude of parameters, most importantly revolutions per minute of the engine, engine torque requested by the driver and the temperature of the coolant.\n\nThe injection pressure of the diesel fuel on the second-generation Multijet is limited to between bar ( psi) on the 1.3 Multijet and bar ( psi) on the 2.4 Multijet 20V.\n\nIn 2009 Fiat Powertrain introduced the third generation of this technology, called Multijet II. With its new and innovative injectors with hydraulically balanced solenoid valve and even higher injection pressure of 2,000 bar (29,000 psi) it is capable of even more precise controlling of the injected diesel fuel, injecting it in a quicker and more flexible manner. It enables up to eight consecutive injections per combustion cycle and implemented Injection Rate Shaping technology, which provides two very close pilot injections making the fuel delivery more continuous and modulated. This results in an engine that is quiet and has a smoother operation, lower emissions, better fuel mileage and higher performance compared to the previous generation.\n\nA 3-cylinder variant, (called XSDE, Xtra Smart Diesel Engine) or \"Smartech Diesel\", was introduced in 2011. Co-developed by GM Powertrain Torino and the GM Technical Center India for the Indian Market the engine is rated at of power and of torque.\n\nApplications:\nA small 1.3 L () version (called the SDE, Small Diesel Engine) introduced in February 2003 is produced in Bielsko-Biała, Poland, and in Ranjangaon, Pune, India, by Fiat India Automobiles. The Multijet 75 PS version was chosen in 2005 as the International Engine of the Year in the 1-litre to 1.4-litre category.\n\nThere are five versions of this engine: a , a (used in the Fiat Punto, Panda, Palio, Albea, Idea; Opel Corsa, Combo, Meriva; Suzuki Ritz, Swift, SX4; and Tata Indica Vista), a variable inlet geometry (used in the Fiat Grande Punto, Linea; Opel Corsa, Astra; Suzuki Ertiga; Tata Indigo Manza and Alfa Romeo MiTo), a from the Multijet II generation, and a available on the Lancia Ypsilon. At the time of the launch this was the smallest four-cylinder diesel engine available and had a fuel consumption of in some applications. The engine is able to meet Euro IV pollution standards without the use of a diesel particulate filter.\n\nIn January 2008, Tata Motors introduced the new Indica Vista model, which features new Quadrajet branded version of this engine. The second generation Ford Ka uses 1.3 Multijet named as Duratorq TDCi. In GM nomenclature, it is called Small Diesel Engine (SDE).\n\nDuring 2009, Fiat launched a new generation badged Multijet II, with a new injection management system (up to 8 injections per cycle, instead of 5) and able to meet Euro V pollution standards. It is available with several power outputs, from , with fixed geometry turbocharger, to , with variable geometry turbocharger.\n\nAs of 2013, more than 5 million 1.3 MultiJet engines were produced. In January 2020, the production of the 1.3 Multijet ended in India as the BS6 emission regulations come into effect in the country from 1 April 2020.\n\nApplications:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Fiat Powertrain announced a downsized version of the 1.9 16V Multijet, a new 1.6L 16V Multijet (1,598 cc) with two power levels of and to replace the still-used 1.9L 8-valve engine. The new 1.6 Multijet diesel with 105 PS was released in December 2007, the 120 PS version arrived later in 2008.\n\nApplications:\n\n\n\nThe most common JTD engine is the 1.9 L straight-4 found on various brands and models. The first car that used this engine was Alfa Romeo 156 in 1997 (), making it the world's first common-rail diesel passenger car. In 1999, it was introduced on the Fiat Punto JTD with a smaller, fixed-geometry turbocharger and , as well as in the Fiat Brava, Bravo and Marea range. There were also , , , , and versions available. The engine block weighs approximately , the cylinder head features an overhead camshaft with directly actuated valves.\n\nThe Multijet second generation features an advanced common-rail system and is available with seven different power outputs. The 8-valve version has , , or and the 16-valve version has , , , or . Except for the 101 PS Multijet, all engines feature a variable-geometry turbocharger.\n\nOpel also uses a version of this engine. Their CDTI engine, manufactured in Pratola Serra, Italy and Kaiserslautern, Germany, is the product of the half-decade joint venture between GM and Fiat. It is used in the Vectra, Signum, Astra, Zafira, Cadillac BLS and Suzuki SX4 as well as some Saabs marked as TiD and TTiD (twinturbo version).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiat Powertrain Technologies released information about new two stage turbo (twin turbo) version of this engine in summer 2007, engine is available with two power levels, first one is producing and second one , both have a maximum torque output of at 2000 rpm. 180 PS version production started summer 2007. The engine weighs approximately . This engine will be sold both to Fiat Group Automobiles and other brands, but the version is reserved only to Fiat Group Automobiles.\n\nApplications:\n\nA new 2 litre (1,956 cc, 83 mm bore, 90.4 mm stroke) Multijet diesel was introduced in third generation Lancia Delta in summer 2008. At its first version this engine produces . For 2009 the engine was fitted to Alfa Romeo 159 as variant. Fiat Sedici, Suzuki SX4 and the new Fiat Doblò generation use a variant of this engine.\n\nGM Powertrain separately developed their diesel engines based on 1.9 JTD, after end of \"marriage\" between GM and Fiat, and first was version for Astra and Insignia, which was later upgraded to 165 PS for Astra (163 PS in restyled version of Insignia), and less powerful version for Insignia with 110 PS and 130 PS. In 2011 GM Powertrain Europe developed a new derivative - the twin-turbocharger BiTurbo version, with , which is used in the Insignia and starting with 2013 in the Astra J. Internally the new engine is referred to as GM Ecotec Family B engine. The same engine was also available in the 2011 Saab 9-5 with 160 PS and 190 PS twin-turbo. In 2013 Opel introduced cleaner and more fuel efficient versions of the 2.0 CDTI engine and the ecoFLEX version, with 99 g/km of CO and 120 PS (140 PS for Insignia).\n\nApplications:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2.2 Multijet II (2,184 cc) was introduced by Fiat Chrysler in mid-2015. These engines produce and with of torque at 2500 RPM in the Jeep Cherokee. It was developed to offer more torque in the low-rev range compared to the 2.0L Multijet. This engine further improves the existing 2.0 Multijet in various areas, such as a higher injection pressure (2,000 Bar instead of 1,600 Bar) with Injector Rate Shaping, an oil pump with variable displacement and counterbalance-shafts to reduce noises and vibrations. This engine meets Euro 6 emission norms without the use of diesel exhaust fluid injection.\n\nA further development of this engine with a 2,143 cc displacement, and a die-cast Aluminium block, is used in the Alfa Romeo Giulia (952). and Jeep Wrangler (JL).\n\nApplications:\n\nThe 2.4 L (2,387 cc) straight-5 version is based on the 2.4 5 cylinder TD engine as used in the Mk1 Fiat Marea and the Mk1 Lancia Kappa. The JTD version benefits from the solid build of the TD block, and an improved head/injection system. There are 2 versions of the 2.4 JTD, the 10-valve as used in the Fiat Marea 130 JTD and the earlier Alfa Romeo 156/Lancia Lybra diesels where it was available as , , and later a Multijet 20-valve version as used in the later (2003>) Alfa Romeo 156 as well as some Lancia vehicles.\n\nIt was designed for transverse front-wheel drive use and was deemed too long and tall for widespread use in other GM Ecotec or Fiat products. A newer Multijet variant of this engine, capable for , is used in the Alfa Romeo 159, Alfa Romeo Brera and Fiat Croma. The latest version of this engine produces and at 1500 rpm, and is used in Alfa Romeo vehicles.\n\nApplications:\nSee List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC.\n\nThe 2.3 Multijet (2,287 cc) was developed by Iveco for heavy-duty applications and is available in three versions 120 MultiJet (Sofim F1AE0481D), 130 MultiJet (Sofim F1AE0481N or F1AE6481D) and 150 MultiJet (Sofim F1AE3481E), these engines produce , and respectively.\n\nApplications:\n\nThe 2.8 JTD (2,798 cc) made by Iveco (Sofim) was used in second generation Fiat Ducato, it produces or .\n\nApplications:\nThe 160 MultiJet Power, introduced in 2007, saw displacement increased to 3.0 L (2,998 cc).

It features Eric Clapton performing in various bands between 1964 and 1970, including The Yardbirds, Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos.\n\nThe compilation is notable for helping Clapton's career when he was battling heroin addiction and making the song \"Layla\" famous. It is also notable for being perhaps the first compilation in rock music to collect music of a single rock musician that spans time, bands, music styles and record labels.\n\nThe album cover picture was taken at George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh while Clapton was playing \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" on a Gibson Byrdland hollow-body guitar.\n\nThe album has two versions of \"Tell the Truth\", both different from and recorded before \"Tell the Truth\" on \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\" (1970). \"Tell the Truth\" on this compilation is a fast up-beat version originally released as a single in July 1970, while \"Tell the Truth – Jam\" is a long and slow instrumental jam from the Layla sessions which had never been released before. The \"Tell the Truth\" single also appeared later on \"Crossroads\" (1988) and on \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs 40th Anniversary Deluxe and Super Deluxe Edition\" (2011). \"Tell the Truth – Jam\" featured on \"\" (1990) as \"Tell the Truth (Jam #1)\"; a second \"Tell the Truth\" jam also featured on \"The Layla Sessions\", which was unreleased at the time.\n\nThe U.S. release of this compilation replaced \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" with \"Tribute to Elmore\", a Clapton and Jimmy Page homage to American blues musician Elmore James. \"Tribute to Elmore\" was one of several jams performed by Clapton, Page and Jeff Beck which were recorded by Page and released later without consulting Clapton or Beck.\n\nIn a review at AllMusic, Bruce Eder wrote that the tracks on \"The History of Eric Clapton\" \"seemed boundless at the time\", from the \"primitive and straightforward\" \"I Ain't Got You\" to \"Layla\" at, what was then, the end of his career. What Eder found extraordinary about this 11-song collection is that it, at the time, only covered two years of Clapton's solo career, but \"still doesn't make a bad summation of his best work.\" He added that the \"Tell the Truth\" jam alone makes \"The History of Eric Clapton\" a \"priority acquisition,\" even for Clapton diehards.\n\nRobert Christgau was a little more critical of the album, saying that while it has several \"worthwhile oddities\" (the \"Tell the Truth\" single and its studio jam, plus King Curtis' \"Teasin), he felt that there should have been more from the Yardbirds and the Bluesbreakers.\n\nReviewing the album in \"Journal-News\" in 1972, Michael O'Connor wrote that while many critics belittled the collection, calling it a \"rehash\" and a \"ripoff\", he felt that, despite its weaknesses and bad song selection, it is a good introduction to Eric Clapton, and \"really isn't that bad a trip\". O'Connor praised Clapton's work with Derek and the Dominos on side four, particularly the \"Tell the Truth\" jam, and concluded that the compilation \"wets my appetite for a future album\".\n\n\nOn the U.S. Atco LP SD2-803, track 3, \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" is replaced with:\n\n"}

{"id": "1998561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998561", "title": "Scorpius X-1", "text": "Scorpius X-1\n\nScorpius X-1 is an X-ray source located roughly 9000 light years away in the constellation Scorpius. Scorpius X-1 was the first extrasolar X-ray source discovered, and, aside from the Sun, it is the strongest apparent source of X-rays in the sky. The X-ray flux varies day-to-day, and is associated with an optically visible star, V818 Scorpii, that has an apparent magnitude which fluctuates between 12-13.\n\nThe possible existence of cosmic soft X-rays was first proposed by Bruno Rossi, MIT Professor and Board Chairman of American Science and Engineering in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Martin Annis, President of AS&E. Following his urging, the company obtained a contract from the United States Air Force to explore the lunar surface prior to the launch of astronauts to the moon, and incidentally to perhaps see galactic sources of X-rays.\n\nSubsequently, Scorpius X-1 was discovered in 1962 by a team, under Riccardo Giacconi, who launched an Aerobee 150 sounding rocket carrying a highly sensitive soft X-ray detector designed by Frank Paolini. The rocket trajectory was slightly off course but still detected a significant emission of soft X-rays that were not coming from the moon. Thus fortuitously, and as first pointed out by Frank Paolini, Scorpius X-1 became the first X-ray source discovered outside the Solar System. The angular resolution of the detector did not initially allow the position of Scorpius X-1 to be accurately determined. This led to suggestions that the source might be located near the Galactic center, but it was eventually realized that it lies in the constellation Scorpius. As the first discovered X-ray source in Scorpius, it received the designation Scorpius X-1.\n\nThe Aerobee 150 rocket launched on June 12, 1962, detected the first X-rays from another celestial source (Scorpius X-1) at J1950 RA Dec . Sco X-1 is a LMXB in which the visual counterpart is V818 Scorpii.\n\nAlthough the above reference indicates the rocket launch was on June 12, 1962, other sources indicate the actual launch was at 06:59:00 UTC on June 19, 1962.\n\nHistorical footnote:\n\"The instrumentation had been designed for an attempt to observe X-rays from the moon and was not equipped with collimation to restrict the field of view narrowly. As a result, the signal was very broad, and accurate definition of the size and position of the source was not possible. A similar experiment was repeated in October 1962 when the galactic center was below the horizon and the strong source was not present. A third attempt, in June 1963, verified the results of the June 1962 flight.\" The Galactic Center is < 20° RA and < 20° Dec from Sco X-1, the two X-ray sources are separated by ~20° of arc and may not have been resolvable in the June 1962 flight.\n\nScorpius XR-1 has been observed at J1950 RA Dec .\n\nIn 1967 (before the discovery of pulsars), Iosif Shklovsky examined X-ray and optical observations of Scorpius X-1 and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from a neutron star accreting matter from a companion.\n\nIts X-ray output is 2.3×10 W, about 60,000 times the total luminosity of the Sun. Scorpius X-1 shows regular variations of up to 1 magnitude in its intensity, with a period of around 18.9 hours. The source varies irregularly in optical wavelengths as well, but these changes are not correlated with the X-ray variations. Scorpius X-1 itself is a neutron star whose intense gravity draws material off this companion into an accretion disk, where it ultimately falls onto the surface, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. As this stellar material accelerates in Scorpius X-1's gravitational field, X-rays are emitted. The measured luminosity for Scorpius X-1 is consistent with a neutron star which is accreting matter at its Eddington limit.\n\nThis system is classified as a low-mass X-ray binary; the neutron star is roughly 1.4 solar masses, while the donor star is only 0.42 solar masses. The two stars were probably not born together; recent research suggests that the binary may have been formed by a close encounter inside a globular cluster.\n\n"}

Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach between Temüjin and Jamukha, leading Temüjin to form a coalition of tribes to oppose him. In the fall of that year, a great battle broke out between Jamukha's alliance and the Keraite-Khamag Mongol alliance at the Ergune valley. This decisive battle, known as the Battle of the Thirteen sides, ended with Temüjin's victory and eventual ascension as Khan of all united Mongol tribes.\n\nJamukha was less successful in building a coalition. For example, he did not recruit shepherds who lacked tribal status in the Mongol tradition, which allowed Temüjin to recover from a series of military defeats inflicted by Jamukha and to emerge victorious.\n\nJamukha was eventually betrayed to Temüjin by his followers in 1206. Temüjin executed Jamukha's betrayers on the principle that betrayal merits the harshest punishment. \"The Secret History of the Mongols\" states that Temüjin offered renewal of their brotherhood, but Jamukha insisted that just as there was room for only one sun in the sky, there was room only for one Mongol lord. He asked to be executed by dying a noble death without the spilling of blood. His request was granted by having his back broken by Temüjin's soldiers.

Most welcome was the return of Dylan's familiar, nasal singing voice. While he has a slightly nasal tone to his voice on \"Alberta #1\" from \"Self Portrait\", this was the first full album with his familiar voice since \"John Wesley Harding\" in 1967, when he began singing with a country croon. In retrospect, the album has come to be viewed as one of the artist's lesser successes, especially following the release of \"Blood on the Tracks\" in 1975, often seen as a fuller return-to-form.\n\nIt reached No. 7 in the US, quickly going gold, and gave Dylan his sixth and last UK number 1 album until \"Together Through Life\" in 2009. The album's most successful song from a commercial perspective is \"If Not for You\", which also was recorded by George Harrison, who had played guitar on a version of the song not released until 1991's \"The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3\", and was also an international hit for Olivia Newton-John in 1971. Bryan Ferry also included the song on \"Dylanesque\".\n\nDylan discusses the recording of \"New Morning\" at length in one chapter of his autobiography, \"Chronicles, Vol. 1\". Several alternate, preliminary forms of the album have been documented, including tracks which later appeared on the 1973 \"Dylan\". He has played only four of the album's twelve songs in concert; one, \"If Dogs Run Free\", made its live debut on October 1, 2000, within weeks of the 30th anniversary of the album's original release.\n\n\"New Morning\" was released just four months after \"Self Portrait\" and there was some speculation that it was recorded hastily and rushed out as an immediate response to the scathing criticism that surrounded \"Self Portrait\". In fact, much of \"New Morning\" was already complete when \"Self Portrait\" was officially released.\n\n\"I didn't say, 'Oh my God, they don't like this, let me do another one,'\" Dylan said in 1975. \"It wasn't like that. It just happened coincidentally that one came out and then the other one did as soon as it did. The \"Self Portrait\" LP laid around for I think a year. We were working on \"New Morning\" when the \"Self Portrait\" album got put together.\"\n\nDuring the March sessions that yielded most of \"Self Portrait\", Dylan attempted three songs that he later rerecorded for \"New Morning\": \"Went to See the Gypsy\", \"Time Passes Slowly\", and \"If Not For You.\" A number of performances were recorded, but none to his satisfaction.\n\nAfter work on \"Self Portrait\" was virtually completed, Dylan held more sessions at Columbia's recording studios in the Columbia Studio Building at 49 East 52nd Street in New York, beginning May 1, 1970. Held in Studio B, the first session was accompanied by George Harrison, bassist Charlie Daniels, and drummer Russ Kunkel. A large number of covers and old compositions were recorded in addition to several new compositions. The results were rejected, although \"Working on a Guru\" and alternate versions of \"Time Passes Slowly\" and \"If Not For You\" have since been released.\n\nSometime in the spring of 1970, Dylan became involved with a new play by poet Archibald MacLeish. A musical version of \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\" was titled \"Scratch\". \"New Morning\", \"Father of Night\" and others were all written for the production. Though Dylan enjoyed talking with MacLeish, he was never confident about writing songs for the play. \"Archie's play was so heavy, so full of midnight murder, there was no way I could make its purpose mine,\" he would later write.\n\nEventually, a conflict with the producer over \"Father of Night\" prompted Dylan to leave the production, withdrawing his songs in the process. Al Kooper, who is credited as co-producer of \"New Morning\", would later say that these three songs were \"pretty much the fulcrum for [\"New Morning\"]... That got him writing a little more.\"\n\nThe next session for \"New Morning\" would not be held until June 1. By this time, Dylan had written several new songs, including \"Three Angels\", \"If Dogs Run Free\", \"Winterlude\", and \"The Man in Me\".\n\nDylan vacated Studio B and moved into Studio E, both of which were in the Columbia Studio Building, where he stayed for the remaining sessions. For five straight days, ending on June 5, Dylan recorded most of \"New Morning\"; he even recorded a number of covers with the intention of including a few on \"New Morning\". The June 1 session was devoted entirely to covers, but Peter La Farge's \"Ballad of Ira Hayes\" was the only one given any serious consideration for inclusion. The June 2 session produced a solo piano rendition of \"Spanish Is the Loving Tongue\"; Al Kooper felt it was a strong candidate for \"New Morning\", but it was ultimately set aside. Jerry Jeff Walker's \"Mr. Bojangles\" and the traditional \"Mary Ann\" were also recorded on June 2, with \"Mr. Bojangles\" receiving serious consideration for inclusion.\n\nOn June 9, several days after those initial June sessions, Dylan accepted an honorary doctorate in music from Princeton University. Dylan did not enjoy the experience, and it inspired him to write a new song, \"Day of the Locusts\".\n\nWeeks later, a session held on June 30 was dedicated to recording new versions of \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" but those recordings were left on the shelf.\n\nBob Johnston was still credited with production, but by July he was absent and would not return. Instead, Dylan and Kooper created the preliminary sequence for \"New Morning\". The process was wrought with frustration, possibly the result of the negative criticism over \"Self Portrait\". The first sequence of \"New Morning\" included a few covers as well as a new version of \"Tomorrow is a Long Time,\" an original composition dating back to 1962.\n\nMeanwhile, Kooper convinced Dylan to record orchestral overdubs for \"Sign on the Window\" and \"New Morning\". An overdub session was held on July 13, but Dylan left those overdubs out of the final mix. These alternate mixes would later appear on . Kooper then convinced Dylan to record overdubs for versions of \"Spanish Is the Loving Tongue\", \"If Not For You\" and \"Went to See the Gypsy\". That overdub session was held on July 23, but Dylan would ultimately reject these recordings.\n\n\"When I finished that album I never wanted to speak to him again,\" Kooper said. \"I was cheesed off at how difficult [the whole thing was]...He just changed his mind every three seconds so I just ended up doing the work of three albums...We'd get a side order and we'd go in and master it and he'd say, 'No, no, no. I want to do this.' And then, 'No, let's go in and cut this.'... There was another version of 'Went to See the Gypsy' that was really good... It was the first time I went in and had an arrangement idea for it and I said, 'Let me go in and cut this track and then you can sing over it.' So I cut this track and it was really good... and he came in and pretended like he didn't understand where to sing on it.\"\n\nDylan ultimately decided to re-record \"If Not for You\" and \"Time Passes Slowly\", holding one final session on August 12. During that session, he also recorded \"Day of the Locusts,\" which by now had been finished.\n\nFor the album's final sequence, the three August 12 recordings were placed at the beginning of \"New Morning\", while covers of \"Ballad of Ira Hayes\" and \"Mr. Bojangles\" were dropped.\n\nThe album opens with \"If Not for You,\" which was also recorded for George Harrison's album \"All Things Must Pass\" released a few months after this album. A sincere, sentimental love song with modest ambitions, it was Dylan's only single from \"New Morning\".\nThe song was later covered by Olivia Newton-John and was also the title song of her first album in 1971.\n\n\"Day of the Locusts\" is a cynical piece of work inspired by his June experience at Princeton University. David Crosby was present, and later commented: \"Sara was trying to get Bob to go to Princeton University, where he was being presented with an honorary doctorate. Bob did not want to go. I said, 'C'mon, Bob it's an honor!' Sara and I both worked on him for a long time. Finally, he agreed. I had a car outside, a big limousine. That was the first thing he didn't like. We smoked another joint on the way and I noticed Dylan getting really quite paranoid about it. When we arrived at Princeton, they took us to a little room and Bob was asked to wear a cap and gown. He refused outright. They said, 'We won't give you the degree if you don't wear this.' Dylan said, 'Fine. I didn't ask for it in the first place.'...Finally we convinced him to wear the cap and gown.\" The lyrics refer to the 17-year cicada infestation covering Princeton at the time:\n\n\"Sure was glad to get out of there alive.\nAnd the locusts sang such a sweet melody.\nand the locusts sang with a high whinin' trill,\nYeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me...\"\n\nIn a 2008 interview with the Aspen Institute, Crosby revealed the line \"The man next to me, his head was exploding\" was in reference to his presence during the events.\n\nIt is often assumed that Dylan wrote \"Went to See the Gypsy\" after meeting Elvis Presley, as the song mentions visiting with a mysterious and important man in a hotel. The song also contains the line, \"A pretty dancing girl was there, and she began to shout... \"He did it in Las Vegas, and he can do it here.\" This lyric was seen by some as a reference to Elvis' record-breaking run of performances in Las Vegas (his series of concerts at the International Hotel commenced on July 31, 1969). The meeting described in the song may have been purely imaginary, however, as Dylan clarified in a 2009 interview with \"Rolling Stone\"s Douglas Brinkley: \"I never met Elvis, because I didn't want to meet Elvis... I know The Beatles went to see him, and he just played with their heads.\" In the same interview, Dylan expanded upon his imagined mythical image of the singer: \"Elvis was truly some sort of American king. Two or three times we were up in Hollywood, and he had sent some of the Memphis Mafia down to where we were to bring us up to see Elvis. But none of us went... I don't know if I would have wanted to see Elvis like that. I wanted to see the powerful mystical Elvis that had crash-landed from a burning star onto American soil.\" In the final lines of the song, Dylan makes mention of a \"little Minnesota town,\" a rare reference to his own childhood in Hibbing.\n\n\"Winterlude\" verges on satirical, a humorous love song directed at a girl named Winterlude, and includes the chorus, \"Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine\". The song was featured in The Comic Strip's 1998 special \"Four Men in a Car\".\n\n\"Winterlude\" is followed by \"If Dogs Run Free\", a beat jazz paean, featuring scat-singing Maeretha Stewart as a guest vocalist and Al Kooper on piano.\n\nThe title track of \"New Morning\" is another one of the lighter tracks, a wry take on country life.\n\n\"Sign on the Window\" expands on the joyous sentiments found in \"New Morning\", applying it to domestic bliss. \"Beginning hesitantly, the last verse of 'Sign on the Window' builds towards its repeated last line not as a forced projection of false hope but as simple, matter-of-fact acceptance of middle-age sentiment,\" writes music critic Tim Riley. \"[These words] offer a way of redefining one's values that doesn't mean copping out or giving up. The antithesis of the family man, at thirty a father of four, begins broaching homeliness without irony—and still convinces you not to hear it as strict autobiography.\"\n\nGuitarist Ron Cornelius recalls, \"Dylan had a pretty bad cold that week. You can hear it on ['Sign on the Window'], y'know, that bit about 'Brighton girls are like the moon,' where his voice really cracks up. But it sure suits the song. His piano playing's weird...because his hands start at opposite ends of the keyboard and then sorta collide in the middle—he does that all the time—but the way he plays just knocks me out.\"\n\nIn \"The Man in Me\", \"Dylan surrenders to the person he sees when his lover looks through him,\" writes Riley. \"He's not trying to impress this lover, so the title hook resonates enough to carry things... 'Take a woman like you to get through/To the man in me' is so direct in its expression of the unflinching cues of intimacy, you forgive him the occasional forced rhyme.\" The song was later featured during several scenes in the 1998 Coen Brothers film \"The Big Lebowski\".\n\n\"Three Angels\" is gospel-tinged track limning sights on an urban street, including \"a man with a badge\", a \"U-Haul trailer\", and \"three fellas crawling their way back to work\". The atmosphere of the song is reminiscent of the recitations recorded by Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter.\n\nThe final song, \"Father of Night\", is Dylan's interpretation of the Jewish prayer Amidah. In 1973, the song was covered by Manfred Mann's Earth Band for the album \"Solar Fire\". At 1 minute 32 seconds, \"Father of Night\" is Dylan's shortest song from a studio-released album.\n\nCritics were quick to praise \"New Morning\" upon its release. Ralph Gleason's \"Rolling Stone\" review reflected most sentiments, proclaiming \"WE'VE GOT DYLAN BACK AGAIN.\" Few placed it alongside his masterworks from the 1960s, but it was considered a substantial improvement over its predecessor. It was only four months since \"Self Portrait\", and many reviewers did not resist comparing the two. \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau named it the seventh best album of 1970. In comparing the record to \"Self Portrait\", he later wrote \"this time he's writing the pop (and folk) genre experiments himself, and thus saying more about true romance than is the pop (or folk) norm.\" Christgau highlighted \"Winterlude\" and \"If Dogs Run Free\", but panned \"Three Angels\" and \"Father of Night\", which he said \"make religion seem dumber than it already is\".\n\nWhile \"New Morning\" neared completion, Dylan and his manager, Albert Grossman, formally dissolved their business relationship on July 17, 1970. Grossman retained certain rights from previous agreements, including royalties on work produced under his management, but their publishing company, Big Sky Music, would be replaced by Ram's Horn Music before the end of 1971, putting an end to any joint ownership in publishing. Dylan would gain complete control over his personal management and his own music publishing. Another tense contract negotiation awaited in 1972, this time with CBS. Until then, there would be little musical activity as Dylan entered the quietest period of his career.\n\n\nTechnical\n"}

Plans for a modern irrigation system are moribund due to lack of funds.\n\nMainly affluent Afghans and foreigners frequent the course. The 2005 entrance fee for The Kabul Golf Club (http://www.kabulgolfclub.org) is 750 Afghani ($15 US Dollars) and a year membership is $300 (15,000 Afghani). The club is run by Mohammad Afzal Abdul (also called Mohammed Bashir), its director and golf pro, who worked as a caddy at the course as a young man before fleeing into exile in Pakistan. Business has dropped off since opening as international agency staffing has declined.\n\nOriginally six holes, the course opened in 1967 during the reign of Mohammed Zahir Shah, was closed in 1978, and reopened in 2004. During these three decades it has undergone several changes. It was relocated to its present site in 1973 after the king was overthrown in a coup d'état and completely closed following a 1978 communist coup. It was reopened in 1993 but closed again in 1996 when the Taliban regime banned sports. After the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the course was used as an area for military training in the removal of land mines. In the process of restoration to its present state, three Soviet tanks and a multiple rocket launcher were removed by a nonprofit agency.\n\nIn 2004 the Kabul Golf Club was reopened again. During the intervening seven years little has changed. Play on the golf course has been sporadic, and at the mercy of the local security situation. Beginning in 2011, a fund-raising effort has been underway with the goal of restoring the golf course and related facilities. Funds are also being sought to subsidize operations until the war is over, assuming the organization will eventually become a viable business.\n\n"}

The song of Yaroslavna on the walls of Putyvl is the emotional culmination of the medieval \"Lay of Igor's Campaign\" and Alexander Borodin's opera \"Prince Igor\".\n\nAfter the Battle of Vedrosha in 1500, Putyvl was ceded to Muscovite Russia. During the Time of Troubles, the town became the center of Ivan Bolotnikov's uprising and briefly a base for the False Dmitry I forces. It was occupied by Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth between 1607 and 1619.\n\nPutyvl was part of Kursk guberniya of the Russian Empire prior to the Bolshevik Revolution. It was part of Ukrainian SSR in 16 October 1925. During the Second World War Soviet partisans led by Sydir Kovpak started their guerrilla war against the Germans in the forests all over the Northern Ukraine. It was under German occupation between 10 September 1941 and 3 September 1943.\n\nThe main architectural monument of Putivl is the Molchansky Monastery, which dates largely to the 17th century. The foundations of its three-domed cathedral, dedicated to the Nativity of the Theotokos, belong to the 1590s, but the main part of the church is one of the earliest Baroque structures in the region, described in its entirety by Paul of Aleppo in 1654. The cathedral displays strong influence of Muscovite architecture, especially in detailing and sculptural decor.\n\nApart from the monastery, Putivl also possesses the Cossack Baroque church of St. Nicholas (1735–37) and the Saviour Cathedral, a singular hybrid of Ukrainian and Russian church architecture, started in 1617 and incorporating such typically Muscovite features as onion domes. Remaining parts of 17th-century fortifications are visible close at hand; these include the gates and several towers, one of which was built up into a belltower in 1700.\n\n"}

What became known as the \"vermouth of Turin\" proved popular with the bourgeoisie of Turin and, later, Casanova.\n\nCinzano Bianco followed, based on a different combination of herbs that included artemisia (wormwood), cinnamon, cloves, citrus and gentian; it was followed by an Extra Dry version. Exports began in the 1890s, to Argentina, Brazil and the USA, among others. In Paris in 1913, Cinzano was the first product to be advertised with a neon sign on its roof.\n\nCinzano remained a family-run business until 1985. Beginning that year, the Marone family, Turin industrialists, began to sell shares in the business, culminating in 1992 with an agreement to turn Cinzano International S.A. entirely over to International Distillers & Vintners, a wholly owned subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan. At the time of its sale, Cinzano's share of the vermouth market in Europe was measured in the low single digits, sales that placed it a distant second to Martini.\n\nAs a result of a 1997 merger, Grand Metropolitan became Diageo; two years later, Diageo sold Cinzano to the privately held Gruppo Campari.\n\nThe Cinzano cycling team had a central role in the film \"Breaking Away\".\n\nIt comes in four versions:\n\n\nCinzano was well known in Britain for its humorous television advertisements featuring Leonard Rossiter and Joan Collins.

The term is also used more broadly, to refer to any bobbin lace made in Denmark.\n\nTønder lace was traditionally made in fine linen thread, imported from the Netherlands. Since the disappearance of the very fine linen threads, it has commonly been made in cotton. It is characterized by honeycomb fillings in motifs, square tallies in the ground, and the use of a gimp, a heavy thread outlining the cloth-stitch motifs. It often had large holes in the motif, called \"Copenhagen holes\", which were an attempt on the part of the lacemakers to speed up production of the lace, as they strove to compete with the cheaper machine-made lace. The designs used were similar to Mechlin lace, with many flowers.\n\nTønder lace was mainly made during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Production started in 1647 when a merchant brought lacemakers from Westphalia to Tønder to teach lacemaking to the general population. Christian IV protected the manufacture of local lace, and didn't wear any foreign lace. In 1712 several lacemakers from Brabant accompanied the troops of King Frederick IV on their return from the Netherlands, bringing new techniques. Tønder lace was a major industry, and most of the region's girls were employed in making it. Little boys, before they were strong enough to work in the fields, were also taught to make lace. In 1801 20,000 people in Tønder and the immediately surrounding area were employed making lace. When machine-made lace was introduced in the late 1800s, the handmade lace industry gradually ceased to be economically important to the region. It never died out entirely though, and is still made today, mostly by hobbyists.\n"}

{"id": "1998629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998629", "title": "Arncliffe railway station", "text": "Arncliffe railway station\n\nArncliffe railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Illawarra line, serving the Sydney suburb of Arncliffe in Bayside Council. It is served by Sydney Trains T4 line services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nArncliffe station opened on 15 October 1884 on the same date as the Illawarra line from Redfern to Hurstville with two side platforms. Arncliffe Station was designed as the first major station on the Illawarra Line southwards from Sydney and was one of the most substantial stations of the eight built in 1884, reflecting the importance of the locality.\n\nThe station, originally known as the Illawarra Road Station, was built by Alfred McNeill and William Clark and designed by the office of the New South Wales Government Railways. Like Sydenham railway station completed in the same year, Arncliffe was constructed with two wayside platforms: the eastern platform contained a 3rd class brick station building, while the western platform contained an impressive 2nd class brick station building having a street frontage.\n\nIn 1906, the northbound platform was converted to an island with a new northbound track. The former northbound track (current Platform 2) became the southbound track, with the former southbound platform (current Platform 3) disused until converted to an island platform in 1923 as part of the quadruplication of the Illawarra line from Wolli Creek to Rockdale. A footbridge and small overhead booking office were also constructed as part of the works.\n\nIn 1909 the Arncliffe-Bexley steam tram began operation, and a tramway siding was added. The Station was originally a wayside station with a matching platform but was converted to its present configuration with the addition of new tracks. In 1923 the line was quadruplicated, and as part of the works an arched brick overbridge was built over Forest Road, which is now the largest single span arched overbridge of the entire railway system.\n\nIn preparation for quadruplication, the original footbridge and overhead booking office were demolished and replaced by a new footbridge in 1919. With construction of the new footbridge, the southern wing of the Platform 1/2 building was demolished. In 1923, the existing Platform 3/4 building was converted to an island platform. As such, the Platform 3/4 building underwent major alterations including new platform awnings constructed on both sides; floor levels raised; and new door and window openings and joinery. A 60-metre tunnel length existed to the south of the station, but was opened out and a bridge to carry Forest Road built in 1923. A new larger timber overhead booking office was constructed in 1925, and the line through the station to Hurstville was electrified in 1926. The Arncliffe-Bexley tram line closed in 1926.\n\nA 1943 Lands Department aerial photo of the station shows the station in its current configuration, including shrub plantings on the platforms.\n\nIn April 2015, work to install four new lifts at Arncliffe station commenced. This was completed in September 2016. In May 2015, work commenced on the construction of a pedestrian tunnel below the Illawarra line 300 metres north of the station. It opened in October 2016.\n\nTransit Systems operate one route via Arncliffe station:\n\nThe heritage-listed railway complex includes the platform 1/2 building (1884), the platform 3/4 building (1885, 1923), the footbridge and stairs (1919), the overhead booking office (1925), the platforms (1884, 1923) and the platform plantings (current and prior to 1943).\n\nArncliffe Railway Station is accessed via a footbridge and stairs, entered from Firth St on the west and via a footpath across a public park from Butterworth Lane on the east side.\n\nThe Platform 1/2 building is similar in form to the Tempe Station buildings, with two gable ends facing the rail lines at each end and on each side of the building. The main (southern) section of the building has a hipped roof with transverse gables clad in corrugated steel roofing with timber louvred gablet vents to the roof. There are two painted brick chimneys. The main gable ends have timber louvred vents with stucco sills and heads. The building has painted brick walls with stucco sills and heads to arched windows. Windows are timber framed double hung. Some doorways retain timber framed fanlights, slightly arched. The main entrance to the building (formerly road entrance) is marked by a gable end projecting in the centre bay. This centre bay is shaped to form a gothic arch. There is one original timber 4 panel door on the west (Platform 1)>side of the building, complete with fanlights and sidelights. On the east (Platform 2) side the building has timber panelled double doors: three pairs with timber framed fanlights with vertical glazing bars.\n\nThe northern end pavilion (former toilets) is attached to the main part of the building via a brick walled courtyard. The painted brick courtyard walls have a projecting stucco moulding at the top. On the western side, there is a covered over doorway into the courtyard. The small square painted brick former toilet pavilion has brick stop chamfered corners and a hipped corrugated steel roof. There are 3 small timber-framed windows to east and west elevations, and a brick screen to the doorway at the northern end.\n\nThe west (Platform 1) awning is supported on groups of 2 or 3 cast iron columns with very elaborate decorative cast iron capitals, brackets and frieze to the underside of the awning beam. There is a central gable to the awning facing the rail lines which also features decorative timber brackets to the gable end. The awning is set back from the platform edge.\n\nThe east (Platform 2) awning has single cast iron columns with 4 radiating decorative cast iron brackets, with similar cast iron brackets attached to the building facade and unusual iron ties and decorative metal valance, mounted on elaborate stucco wall brackets. This was the original platform face of the building. There are steel security doors.\n\nThe waiting room has a chimney breast and modern floor tiles, plaster timber-battened ceiling with a plaster ceiling rose and plaster moulded cornices.\n\nSimilar to platform buildings at Sydenham Railway Station, the Platform 3/4 building is a single storey painted brick building. There are separate painted brick toilets with three small timber framed double hung windows each side, entered from the north end and with a brick screen to the entry doorway. The toilets are connected to the main platform building by a linking structure with a gabled corrugated steel roof and walls of corrugated steel with timber louvres.\n\nThe main (northern) section of the platform building is painted brick with a corrugated steel gabled roof, with one chimney to the north end.

Supervision seasons typically run from July 1 through to the last weekend in August, with a few beaches continuing weekend supervision into September. The NSLS developed the Nova Scotia Surf League, Canada's first surf lifesaving competition series, and has seen several Nova Scotians selected to the Core Team of the Canadian National Lifesaving Team since its inception.\n\nThe service was born out of a 1972 study into a high number of drownings at public beaches in Nova Scotia. Originally called the Nova Scotia Beach Supervision Project, the beaches were organized by region, so that each region is required to recruit and hire lifeguards for the beaches, thereby supplying lifeguard supervision. The program was centralized and began employing a full-time director in 1975, when it also changed its name to the Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service.\n\nIn 2019, the NSLS supervised 23 beaches around the province and was responsible for training and administration services for several others.\n\n\nLifeguards employed with the NSLS must complete a physically rigorous selection process.\n\nAll lifeguard applicants to NSLS must be certified with the RLSSC's National Lifeguard Service Award and also maintain certification in Standard First Aid as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) level C.\n\nApplicants are then tested with a timed 500-meter swim in surf conditions, followed by a timed 3.2 km run, and a timed 50-meter carry with a suitably weighted mannequin.\n\nThe physical test is followed by a written test. Should an applicant be hired, s/he must successfully complete a four-day NSLS training camp with all new and returning lifeguards immediately prior to the start of the supervision season, during which there are further evaluations of skills based on performance during mock emergency scenarios. Should an applicant not meet the standard during the training camp, alternates who are successful will be selected in their place.\n\nThis rigorous selection program to ensure the highest level of skill and competency has proven to be a successful formula. No person has drowned within the supervised area of any NSLS beach during hours of supervision since the program's inception in 1973.\n\n\"Nova Scotia Surf League\" is a lifeguard competition operated by NSLS. Started in 2000, it is Canada's first lifesaving competition series. The format of the series was modeled after an Australian professional lifesaving circuit called the Nutri-Grain Surf League. It has aimed to focus on increasing the level of participation among in the sport of lifesaving among Nova Scotia lifeguards, mainly through providing regular access to competition. The league founder, Craig Durling, remains active today as the league's Commissioner.\n\nPrior to the existence of Surf League, Nova Scotians would often travel to competitions in Ontario, Quebec and the United States.\n\nAt the conclusion of each summer, league awards are presented to the top teams and individuals who competed on the series. Career statistics are also maintained by the league for wins for men and women.\n\n"}
{"id": "1998636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998636", "title": "Vash the Stampede", "text": "Vash the Stampede\n\n, is the protagonist of \"Trigun\", a manga series created by Yasuhiro Nightow in 1995. Set on the planet No Man's Land/Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of $$60 billion (\"double dollar\") and the nickname after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters and assassins working for his twin brother, Millions Knives. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by befriending citizens and refusing to murder his enemies. \n\nNightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his pacifist ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. The manga was adapted for television as an anime series in which Vash was voiced by Masaya Onosaka as an adult and Kōki Miyata as a child. For the English dub, Johnny Yong Bosch voices him as an adult and Bryce Papenbrook as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film \"\", among other one-shots. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. \n\nCritics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response. While some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remains popular in the anime adaptation and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch were praised for their performances, though critics favored Onosaka.\n\n\"Trigun\" manga author Yasuhiro Nightow has stated that Vash's name was his own creation rather than references to bands he gave to other members from the cast. He developed Vash as having a serious personality with a childish side, and found him to be the most relatable of all his creations. To contrast Vash from the typical heroes in action films, Nightow portrayed him as a pacifist since he did not want his lead character to be a murderer. Throughout the story, Vash avoids killing enemies by disarming them and avoids inflicting mortal wounds during combat. His cheerful personality was used to highlight this trait with his catchphrase being: \"Hey, sorry. Love and peace?\" To emphasize that Vash is an experienced gunman, Nightow depicted him as having a strong eyesight that gives him a more precise aim. While making the series, he was surprised by Vash's popularity with Western readers. Comparing Vash's manga characterization with his anime persona, Nightow said his version does not have as many crushes on the women he meets.\n\nTo make Vash's appearance distinctive, Nightow often changed the character's hair color throughout the serialization. Although fans questioned if this was relevant to the story, Nightow chose not to reveal his reason for it. In the series' climax, it is revealed that Vash's blond hair turning black is a secondary effect of overusing his supernatural powers. Despite his efforts in his design, Nightow regrets giving Vash and antagonist Legato Bluesummers detailed eyes because he drew them inconsistently in the manga. Nightow had trouble designing Vash's gun as he aimed it to look visually attractive and effective to use. Although he originally wanted to create a gun with unlimited bullets, he replaced it with a traditional one after consulting a picture of an upside-down barrel for inspiration. Besides Vash's guns, Nightow portrayed him as having a supernatural power known as the \"Angel Arms,\" in which his arms mutate to form a weapon. The Angel Arms adopt a feminine form and can create or give birth to matter.\n\nWhile Vash is the manga's protagonist, anime director Satoshi Nishimura used Meryl Stryfe as the main character. In the anime, she searches for the Humanoid Typhoon and initially does not believe it is Vash due to his childish behavior. To create suspense, writer Yōsuke Kuroda suggested that Vash would not shoot a bullet until the fifth episode, which causes Meryl to realize he is the famous gunman.\n\nMasaya Onosaka started voicing Vash in the anime, which premiered in Japan in 1998. Onosaka said he was unaware when the 2010 film, \"\", would be made and that most of the cast and crew felt left in the dark for a long time before production began. After the film's announcement, Onosaka was happy to see his character featured in theaters for the first time and to work with the \"Trigun\" cast for the first time since the anime ended twelve years earlier. New voice actor Maaya Sakamoto said she liked being involved in the film because she interpreted Vash through her character, a bounty hunter named Amelia Ann McFly, who starred in the movie as a lead. Kōki Miyata voiced the young Vash.\n\nJohnny Yong Bosch started his voice acting career by providing Vash's voice in \"Trigun\"'s English-dubbed version. He had never heard of the series until he was hired for the role. According to Bosch, most of the fan responses to his performance were positive, and Nightow found his performance to be appealing. Bosch attributed his positive reception to the story and casting director. He enjoyed Vash's traits, specifically his pacifist philosophies alongside the catchphrase: \"This world is made of love and peace!\" Vash's younger self from the flashbacks is voiced by Bryce Papenbrook.\n\nThe origins of Vash and his twin brother Millions Knives are explored in flashbacks from the \"Trigun\" manga when the children live in a spaceship containing the last few surviving humans who have fled Earth due to its lack of resources. The two are identified as \"Plants\" since they age at a slower rate. They are raised by a researcher named Rem Saverem in a space ship colony. Through Rem's education, Vash gains a newfound respect for life, but his brother seeks the mayhem in mankind. Knives disrupts the navigation system, triggering an alarm and waking the dormant passengers. When Knives sabotages the fleet, putting it on a crash course with the planet No-man's Land, Rem puts him and Vash in an escape pod to save them. Rem chooses to stay behind and attempts to prevent the crash rather than escaping. As the two children become young adults, they separate, with Knives amputating Vash's left arm in a fight. Vash is found by a group of humans who construct his cybernetic arm. Knives also attempts to activate Vash's dormant supernatural powers, the Angel Arm, but the plan backfires and a blast obliterates the city of July, leaving 200,000 people without food or shelter. The incident earns Vash's reputation as \"The Humanoid Typhoon\".\n\nWhen the \"Trigun\" manga begins, Vash travels around the planet searching for Knives. He befriends Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, two agents of the Bernardelli Insurance Society, sent to evaluate claims regarding the dangers he has caused and whether or not his bounty should be canceled. He also meets a priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who fights alongside him. Vash is targeted by Legato Bluesummers from the Gung-ho Guns assassins who are followers of Knives. After Legato confronts Vash, Knives reappears. A shocked Vash requests evacuation for Meryl and Milly because of the danger his brother presents. Knives then tries to use Vash's Angel Arm to destroy another city, but Vash resists and redirects the blast upward, where it hits one of No-man's moons.\n\nIn the \"Trigun Maximum\" manga, which occurs two years after the moon's destruction, Wolfwood discovers Vash relating Knives' exploits in regards to mankind's extinction. In facing Legato's group, Vash fears that they have discovered the location of his home, resulting in the deaths of his friends. Vash learns a ship has made contact with Earth and will be arriving to save them from No-man's Land. Knives uses his powers as a Plant to shut down the satellites used to communicate with Earth. Vash learns of the severed connection and guesses its cause. Gung-ho Guns Hoppered the Gauntlet, a survivor of July, seeks revenge on Vash, but is killed by his partners as Knives ordered them not to kill their target but tormenting him. Vash and Wolfwood continue traveling to Knives' base. However, Vash is defeated and restrained by Legato. Wolfwood, revealed as a member of the Gung-ho Guns, rescues Vash.\n\nVash rejoins Wolfwood, who fights with Gung-ho Gun Livio to the death. When Wolfwood dies, Livio, Wolfwood's childhood friend, joins Vash' cause while grieving for his friend's death. As Knives approaches the city with the \"Ark\", a floating ship designed to leave humans without any resources and end life on the planet. Knives begins dueling with Vash. Throughout his past battles that required him to use the Angel's Arm, Vash has transfromed into a regular human signified by his blond hair now turned black. Vash breaks his pacifist vow by killing Legato to protect Livio from the last Gung-ho Guns. Knives also starts losing the powers he stored with the Ark through Vash's actions. Vash then saves his brother from the vengeful ships from Earth. Following his defeat, Knives uses his last powers to help his weakened brother by creating a small fruit tree to feed him. After his brother's death, Vash continues his travels on the planet with Meryl and Milly.\n\nIn the anime, No-Man's Land is called Gunsmoke. While wandering Gunsmoke with Knives, Vash shoots his brother for trying to kill more people. Vash is rescued by a group of humans from the only remaining functioning ships on the planet and leaves after a few months. He goes to July in the hopes of meeting Rem's friends but finds Knives has killed them. In the ensuing firefight, Knives shoots off Vash's left arm which activates his White Angel Arm, resulting in July's destruction. Throughout the series, Vash feels pressure to avoid killing his enemies. As the two interact, Wolfwood decides to be a pacifist like Vash, but is killed by one of Knives' men. Bringing Vash further grief is Legato who controls the civilians targeting Meryl and Milly. This forces Vash to kill Legato in order to save his friends. Despite being initially shocked by the idea of committing a sin, Vash find peace when Meryl says any person can find redemption regardless of action. Vash faces and defeats Knives whose fate is ambiguous. Vash then decides to adopt a new way of life, discarding the red coat that marked Rem's influences over him. The anime ends as Vash returns with his brother's body to Meryl and Mully.\n\nBesides the anime, Vash appears in the 2010 \"Trigun\" film, \"\", in which he travels to Macca City where he meets a bounty hunter named Amelia Ann McFly. Seeking revenge against a thief named Gasback, Amelia joins Vash and Wolfwood in a quest to capture him. Amelia decides to follow Vash's example and does not kill Gasback, but allows him to be taken into custody. Vash also appears in a manga anthology of alternative stories; Vash being the protagonist who, along with Wolfwood, protects a village from thieves. In the sequel to the manga by Boichi, Vash meets another Plant who seeks her own death.\n\nVash was ranked second in the 1998 Annual Anime Grand Prix in the Male Character Category behind Spike Spiegel from \"Cowboy Bebop\". In 2000, the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation awarded Vash the Best Male Character, U.S. Release award. \"Anime News Network\" listed him and Wolfwood as one of the biggest \"fiercest frenemies\" because of their constant struggles and consistent friendship. \"AnimeNation\" considered Vash one of the most popular 1990s characters along with Spike Spiegel and Sakura Kinomoto from \"Cardcaptor Sakura\" manga.\n\nIn 2009, Vash the Stampede was ranked 17th in \"IGN\"s Top Anime Characters of All Time, and Nightow was praised for how well \"Trigun\"s lead is designed. \"IGN\" ranked him as the 20th greatest anime character of all time in 2014 because of the balance displayed between his goofiness and grief in the narrative. \"HobbyConsolas\" listed Vash as one of the coolest characters in anime based on his skills and personality. In another poll, Vash was voted the second-best Masaya Onosaka character after France from \"\". Vash has been the used in merchandise, including action figures, plush dolls, keychains, clothes, and cosplay sunglasses.\n\nThe lead singer of Mushroomhead wore a Vash the Stampede coat in many concerts before it was stolen from his dressing room. Vash also made a cameo appearance in Boichi's gangster manga \"Sun-Ken Rock\", when the cast goes to watch the \"Trigun\" film.\n\nCritical reception to the character has been positive. \"Anime News Network\" stated Vash seems to have been influenced by Western films and compared him with Himura Kenshin from the \"Rurouni Kenshin\" manga because of their pacifism. \"Manga Life\" compared Vash's way of life with that of the American Midwest in the 1800s. They called his characterization \"fantastic\" based on the personality he displays when facing enemies as he refuses to murder anybody. When more of the character's past is revealed because of his conflict with his enemies, \"Manga Life\" said Vash's true self makes him more engaging, something which is expanded by the artwork. Vash's reintroduction in \"Maximum\" drew positive comments with a reviewer from \"Mania Entertainment\" saying both new and existing readers would be attracted by the restart of Vash's journey after moments of peace. In a later review, however, \"Mania Entertainment\" said some events that happened to Vash might come across as repetitive because his pacifism keeps backfiring and no proper solution has yet been given. As Vash's philosophy was tested in the finale, \"Fandom Post\" praised the consequences of his actions. \"BlerdsOnline\" noted Vash got so much grief the reader would also feel it when reading the manga.\n\nJournalists have also commented on Vash's role in Madhouse's adaptation of the manga. \"Escapist Magazine\" regarded Vash's characterization as one of the most intriguing aspects of \"Trigun\" because while being a pacifist, he fights to protect others and despite his victories, he is never seen as overpowered. \"AnimeOnDVD\" enjoyed him for \"running a gamut of emotions and attitudes\" while displaying multiple skills that made him the most powerful fighter on the planet. The reviewer also said the change in Vash's character makes him more interesting to watch in the darker scenarios. Vash's backstory and its effect on him were described as \"really interesting\" because it would prompt questions from the audience. \"T.H.E.M Anime Reviews\" called Vash \"the poster-child for the misunderstood hero\". Similarly, \"Anime News Network\" praised Vash's characterization for avoiding cliches often seen in Western stories. \"AnimeNation\" compared Vash with Abel Nightroad from the \"Trinity Blood\" anime based on their similar traits, saying they might be interpreted as identical characters. In the book \"Anime Impact: The Movies and Shows that Changed the World of Japanese Animation\", Chris Stuckmann compares Vash with John McClane from the \"Die Hard\" action films because of the similar misunderstandings the two go through while facing enemies.\n\nSome critics commented on Vash's relationship with Knives. His final fight against Knives was seen as another well-developed scenario by \"ANN\". \"Escapist\" compared Vash and Knives to yin and yang because of their contrasting natures, which made their antagonism more appealing. \"Comic Book Bin\" also made this comparison, suggesting they subtly parallel Cain and Abel from the Book of Genesis because of how much Knives wants to torment his brother. By the manga's climax, \"Mania\" claimed the fight between these two characters was \"the stuff of legend.\"\n\nCritics also commented on the \"Badlands Rumble\" portrayal of Vash. \"DVD Talk\" enjoyed it, stating his characterization would appeal to the audience. UK Anime Network said the character delivers the series' original pacifist message despite the attention given to comedy. \"Otaku USA\" said that Vash's portrayal in the movie is true to his character in the television series. \"ANN\" had mixed thoughts about Vash's movie persona. While finding this portrayal faithful to the original one, \"ANN\" said Vash's act as a lazy character takes too much time until his true self is revealed. Bosch's performance was praised nevertheless. \"BlerdsOnline\" noted it was one of Nightow's strongest points when writing \"Trigun Maximum\", along with the antagonism Vash has with Knives.\n\nReviewers also commented on Vash's voice actors with \"Escapist\" praising Bosch's work. On the other hand, \"DVDTalk\" found Onosaka's work better than Bosch's. Similarly, despite being praised for his childish take on Vash, Bosch's acting was criticized as unfitting when Vash sounds serious by \"Japanator\". As a result, the reviewer recommended Onosaka instead. \"UK Anime Network\" enjoyed Vash's role in Nightow's first one-shot from \"Multiple Bullets\", but criticized Boichi's portrayal of him as childish and almost like a Mary Sue.\n"}
{"id": "1998642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998642", "title": "Presumption of death", "text": "Presumption of death\n\nA presumption of death occurs when a person is legally declared dead despite the absence of direct proof of the person's death, such as the finding of remains (e.g., a corpse or skeleton) attributable to that person. Such a declaration is typically made when a person has been missing for an extended period and in the absence of any evidence that the person is still alive – or after a much shorter period but where the circumstances surrounding a person's disappearance overwhelmingly support the belief that the person has died (e.g., an airplane crash).\n\nA declaration that a person is dead resembles other forms of \"preventive adjudication\", such as the declaratory judgment. Different jurisdictions have different legal standards for obtaining such a declaration and in some jurisdictions a legal presumption of death may arise after a person has been missing under certain circumstances and a certain amount of time.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, it is usually necessary to obtain a court order directing the registrar to issue a death certificate in the absence of a physician's certification that an identified individual has died. However, if there is circumstantial evidence that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the individual is deceased on the balance of probabilities, jurisdictions may agree to issue death certificates without any such order. For example, passengers and crew of the RMS \"Titanic\" who were not rescued by the RMS \"Carpathia\" were declared legally dead soon after \"Carpathia\" arrived at New York City. More recently, death certificates for those who perished in the September 11 attacks were issued by the State of New York within days of the tragedy. The same is usually true of soldiers missing after a major battle, especially if the enemy keeps an accurate record of its prisoners of war.\n\nIf there is not sufficient evidence that death has taken place, it may take somewhat longer, as simple absence does not necessarily prove death. The requirements for declaring an individual legally dead may vary depending on numerous details including the following:\n\nMost countries have a set period of time (seven years in many common law jurisdictions) after which an individual is presumed dead if there is no evidence to the contrary. However, if the missing individual is the owner of a significant estate, the court may delay ordering the issuing of a death certificate if there has been no real effort to locate the missing person. If the death is thought to have taken place in international waters or in a location without a centralized and reliable police force or vital statistics registration system, other laws may apply.\n\nThe Chinese law treats declaratory judgment of death and disappearance differently. Relevant provisions can be found in Section 3 (\"Declaration of Disappearance and Declaration of Death\"), Chapter 2 (\"Natural Persons\") of the \"General Provisions of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China\" enacted in 2017.\n\nIn terms of the declaration of disappearance, where a natural person has disappeared for two years, an interested party may apply to a people's court for a declaration of absence of the natural person. The period of disappearance of a natural person shall be counted from the day when he or she is not heard from. If a person disappears during a war, the period of disappearance shall be counted from the day when the war ends or from the date of absence as confirmed by the relevant authority.\n\nAs for the declaration of death, where a natural person falls under any of the following circumstances, an interested party may apply to a people's court for a declaration of death of the natural person:\n\n\nWhere a person has disappeared from an accident, and it is impossible for the person to survive the accident as certified by the relevant authority, an application for a declaration of death of the person is not subject to the two-year period.\n\nIn the event of contradictory applications for declaration, meaning that both an application for a declaration of death and an application for a declaration of absence of the same natural person are filed by the interested parties with a people's court, the people's court shall declare the death of the person if the conditions for a declaration of death as set out in this Law are met.\n\nThe Chinese law specifically talks about the return of the absentee. The validity of the previous declaratory judgment of death is not imperiled by the sheer fact of return. The absentee or interested party (or parties) must apply for the revocation of the said declaratory judgment, then can it be annulled. The legal consequence of revoking declaratory judgment is essentially about restoration, i.e. the return of property and restoration of marriage. Chinese legislator made a rather peculiar choice to restore marriage between the absentee and his or her spouse, providing that the spouse has not remarried or declared unwillingness of restoring marriage. This is quite unusual among the legal regimes around the world.\n\nConditions for declaration of death according to the disappearance law (\"Verschollenheitsgesetz\"):\n\n\nPresumption of death is governed by sections 107 and 108 of the Evidence Act, which allows for presumption of death for a person missing for 7 years to be raised in appropriate proceedings before the court.\n\nIf there is strong evidence a missing person is dead the coroner may request an inquest under Section 23 of the Coroners Act 1962. If the Minister for Justice grants the inquest then the person may be declared legally dead if that is the outcome of the inquest. As an alternative an application may be made to the high court, normally this is after at least 7 years of going missing, but exceptionally may be earlier if there is strong implication from the circumstances the person is dead.\n\nIt takes twenty years to declare a missing person dead. After ten years from someone's disappearance, a motion to declare the person legally dead can be filed in court. After that, another ten years must pass before the person can be declared legally dead.\n\nDeclaration of presumed death is stipulated in articles 29–32 of the Polish Civil Code and pronounced as a court judgment. In general, a period of 10 years is required to pass for a legal declaration to be made, with the following exceptions:\nA court's declaration of death comes into effect retroactively and is subject to legal consequences from before the date of the declaration, going back to the assumed date of death, as declared by the court.\n\nAccording to article 45 of Civil Code of Russia, a person may be declared dead only by a court decision, on the following grounds:\n\nA legal date of death is considered to be the date when the court decision declaring person dead was made. If a person disappeared under life-threatening circumstances, the day of his or her actual disappearance may also be considered the legal date of death.\n\nThe declaration of death by the court has the same legal consequences as if the fact of death was proven:\n\nIf such decision was a mistake and the person later returns, the decision is nullified and the person becomes eligible to request most of his assets back. However, if the husband or wife of such person married again, the marriage will not be restored. His funds and securities, taken under bona fide circumstances, also cannot be requested back.\n\nPrior to 2013, English law generally assumed a person was dead if, after seven years:\nThis was a rebuttable presumption at common law – if the person subsequently appeared, the law no longer considered them dead.\n\nOtherwise, courts could have granted leave to applicants to swear that a person was dead (within or after the seven-year period). For example, an executor may have made such an application so they could have been granted probate for the will. This kind of application would only have been made sooner than seven years where death was probable, but not definitive (such as an unrecovered plane crash at sea), following an inquest (see below). Such an application was specific to the court where it was made – thus separate applications had to be made at a coroner's inquest, for proceedings under the Matrimonial Causes and Civil Partnership Acts (for remarriage), for probate, and under the Social Security Act.\n\nThese processes were not considered satisfactory, and so in February–March 2013, the Presumption of Death Act 2013 was passed to simplify this process. The new act, which is based on the Presumption of Death (Scotland) Act 1977, allows applying to the High Court to declare a person presumed dead. This declaration is conclusive and cannot be appealed. It is recorded on a new Register of Presumed Deaths, and has the same effect as a registration of death. Death is taken to occur on (a) the last day that they could have been alive (if the court is satisfied that they are dead), or (b) the day seven years after the date they were last seen (if death is presumed by the elapse of time).\n\nIn England and Wales, if the authorities believe there should be an inquest, the local coroner files a report. This may be done to help a family receive a death certificate that may bring some closure. An inquest strives to bring any suspicious circumstances to light. The coroner then applies to the Secretary of State for Justice, under the Coroners Act 1988 section 15, for an inquest with no body. The seven years rule only applies in the High Court of Justice on the settlement of an estate. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, the number of requests received each year is fewer than ten, but few of these are refused. Without a body, an inquest relies mostly on evidence provided by the police, and whether senior officers believe the missing person is dead. One notable person presumed dead under the Act is the 7th Earl of Lucan (Lord Lucan), who was last seen alive in 1974 (although there have been numerous alleged sightings since that time), and whose death certificate was issued in February 2016.\n\nThe incidence of presumed death in England and Wales is considered low – in September 2011, it was estimated that only 1% of the 200,000 missing persons each year remained unaccounted for after 12 months, with a cumulative total of 5,500 missing persons by September 2011.\n\nIn Scotland, legal aspects of the presumption of death are outlined in the Presumption of Death (Scotland) Act 1977. If a person lived in Scotland on the date they were last known to be alive, authorities can use this act to declare the person legally dead after the standard period of seven years.\n\nThe declaration of a missing person as legally dead falls under the jurisdiction of the individual states unless there is a reason for the federal government to have jurisdiction (e.g. military personnel missing in combat).\n\nPeople who disappear are typically called \"missing\", or sometimes \"absent\". Several criteria are evaluated to determine whether a person may be declared legally dead:\n\nProfessor Jeanne Carriere, in \"The Rights of the Living Dead: Absent Persons in Civil Law\" (published in the \"Louisiana Law Review\"), stated that as of 1990, the number of such cases in the United States was estimated at between 60,000 and 100,000.\n\nAccording to Edgar Sentell, a retired senior vice-president and general counsel of Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, almost all states recognize the presumption of death, by statute or judicial recognition of the common law rule. Some states have amended their statutes to reduce the seven-year period to five consecutive years missing, and some, such as Minnesota and Georgia, have reduced the period to four years.\n\nIf someone disappears, those interested can file a petition to have them declared legally dead. They must prove by the criteria above that the person is in fact dead. There are constitutional limitations to these procedures: The presumption must arise only after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed. The absent person must be notified. Courts permit notifying claimants by publication. Adequate safeguards concerning property provisions must be made in the case that an absent person shows up.\n\nSome states require those who receive the missing person's assets to return them if the person turned out to be alive. If a person is declared dead when only missing, their estate is distributed as if they were dead. In some cases, the presumption of death can be rebutted. According to Sentell, courts will consider evidence that the absent person was a fugitive from justice, had money troubles, had a bad relationship, or had no family ties or connection to a community as reasons not to presume death.\n\nA person can be declared legally dead after they are exposed to \"imminent peril\" and fail to return—as in a plane crash, as portrayed in the movie \"Cast Away\". In these cases courts generally assume the person was killed, even though the usual waiting time to declare someone dead has not elapsed. Sentell also says, \"The element of peril accelerates the presumption of death.\" This rule was enacted after the attack on the World Trade Center, so that authorities could release death certificates. Although people presumed dead sometimes turn up alive, it is not as common as it used to be. In one case where this occurred, a man named John Burney disappeared in 1976 while having financial problems, and later reappeared in December 1982. His company and wife had already received the death benefits—so, on returning, the life insurance company sued him, his wife, and his company. In the end, the court ruled Burney's actions fraudulent.\n\nMissing persons have on rare occasions been found alive after being declared legally dead (see below). Prisoners of war, people with mental illnesses who become homeless, and in extremely rare circumstances kidnapping victims may be located years after their disappearance. Some people have even faked their deaths to avoid paying taxes, debts, etc.\n\n\n\n"}

Approximately 500 inmates are incarcerated at Millhaven.\n\nOpened in 1971, Millhaven was originally built to replace Ontario's other aging maximum security prison, Kingston Penitentiary in Kingston Ontario. A riot at Kingston Penitentiary forced Millhaven to open prematurely. During the period of 1977–1984, a Special Handling Unit (SHU) operated at Millhaven, alongside its general maximum-security population. A new Canada-wide Special Handling Unit was subsequently opened in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines Quebec, and the Millhaven SHU was closed.\n\nMillhaven also housed the federal inmate intake and assessment unit for the Ontario region (Millhaven Assessment Unit or MAU until 2013 when the assessment unit was moved to Joyceville High Medium Institute (JAU) in order to facilitate the closing of Kingston Pen). Federal parole violators were returned to MAU (from whatever Ontario region they were arrested) to appear in front of the National Parole Board for disposition. Millhaven is one of two identically designed maximum security institutions in Canada. The other is located at Archambault Institution, Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec.\n\nAlso located on same property is Bath Institution, a medium security facility located along the shores of Lake Ontario. Opened in 1972, it houses 340 inmates.\n\nMillhaven consists of three main living units, a segregation unit and a hospital wing. There are approximately 120 men per unit. Units have two levels. Ranges are double-sided and have hydraulically locking metal doors (See video in \"External Links\" section), housing two inmates per cell. The ranges/cells are designated by alphanumeric code (i.e. B1, H2 etc.).\n\nMain living units are designated by Alpha codes:\n\nA Unit = \"Federal Intake and Assessment Unit – Ontario region\" (MAU) (ranges B, C, & D)\n\nE Unit = \"Federal Intake and Assessment Unit – Ontario region\" (MAU) (and institutional workers) (ranges F, G, & H)\n\nI Unit = \"Administrative Segregation/Special Needs\"\n\nJ Unit = \"Maximum Security Unit\" (MSU) (ranges K, L, & M)\n\nN Area = \"Main intersection and security control hub.\"\n\nMAU (Millhaven Assessment Unit) houses inmates recently sentenced to federal time, in the Ontario region. They are assessed and placed in other prisons according to security needs. MAU is classified as \"integrated\" (housing convicts serving time on all types of charges).\n\nMSU (J unit) houses habitually violent offenders, and is \"non-integrated\" (no sex offenders, informants or incompatibles). Many inmates with life sentences are also housed in MSU. It is considered a \"\"gladiator school\"\", and convicts who serve time there are revered in the criminal subculture.\n\nOn September 30, 2013 Kingston Penitentiary was closed. Many maximum security inmates housed there were transferred to Millhaven. A new 96 bed facility was constructed within the Millhaven compound, to house inmates from the Kingston Pen closure.\n\nThe perimeter is surrounded by a double 30-foot razor fence, and has observation towers at the corners.\n\nA 4-foot \"warning fence\" inside the perimeter of the exercise yard acts as a boundary that inmates cannot cross without deadly force being used. Armed patrol vehicles with Colt Canada C7 rifles and parabolic microphones are on guard at all times. There are motion sensors in the outlying property, and multiple CCTV units throughout.\n\nVisitors are subject to personal and vehicle search once on CSC property, and an ION scanner is used upon entry to detect drugs or other compounds on clothing or personal objects. The visiting area is equipped with CCTV, and listening devices are embedded in each table.\n\nInmates in the MAU (intake - A and E units) are allowed only screened visits, behind glass.\n\nOver the years, the institution has seen its share of violence. J unit is considered one of the most dangerous places in Canada's prison system. The most unruly inmates are often housed there.\n\nOn July 10, 1972, fourteen inmates escaped a recreation yard by clipping the chain link fence. A subsequent manhunt was undertaken by police and Canadian Forces personnel. Three hundred police officers and soldiers from CFB Trenton created a cordon that eventually yielded the capture of most of the escapees. The event was immortalized in song by the Kingston Ontario rock band The Tragically Hip in \"38 Years Old\" from the \"Up to Here\" album. The lyrics in fact have the date and number of escapees wrong (\"twelve men broke loose in '73); this was done for rhyming purposes to match the next line (...\"from Millhaven maximum security).\n\nOn the first anniversary of the August 10, 1975 suicide of prisoner Edward Nalon in the infamous \"back hole\" at Millhaven, prisoners at Millhaven refused to work and began a hunger strike for improvements to the prison system. They asserted that their strike was in solidarity with a strike at the British Columbia Penitentiary, and their strike inspired sympathy hunger strikes at Collins Bay Institution and Joyceville Institution.\n1977 escapees shot whilst climbing fences at Millhaven institution Glenn Thomas landers was killed while fellow inmate Florant Tanguay was injured by buckshot. Prior to the escape attempt a riot had been staged as well as the inmates had fashioned “zip” guns and had also smuggled a number of .22 rounds into the prison to aid in their escape which ultimately failed.\nOn July 5, 1985, the warden of Millhaven (Al Stevenson) was placed under police protection due to credible threats to his life. The threats came from unknown Millhaven inmates. He was transferring in to Millhaven from Stony Mountain Institution in Manitoba, where he had a reputation of strictness. Warden Stevenson and his family were placed under guard by the OPP (Ontario Provincial Police). This caution was taken due to the 1978 murder of Archambault Institution (Quebec) warden Michel Roy.\n\nIn 2004, correctional officers employed at Millhaven Maximum Security were concerned about their safety after a rash of inmate uprisings. The Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta had ruled that an inmate can conceal a weapon (when in prison) if he/she is defending themselves. This ruling sparked a rash of weapon related attacks in the living units.\n\nIn May 2009, Millhaven was the site of a riot which lasted less than 24 hours.\n\nOn October 12, 2010, a correctional officer with a rifle shot a convict who refused orders to stop assaulting another prisoner in an outdoor recreation yard.\n\nOn December 7, 2010, 120 inmates in the assessment unit refused to return to their cells at the end of a recreation period. They began to barricade themselves in the area and guards fired shotguns and used chemical agents to gain control of the situation.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, inmate Jordan Trudeau, 29, was killed in an altercation. The event took place in the gymnasium area during exercise for maximum security inmates. Trudeau and another inmate, David Bagshaw, 21, attacked a third inmate and were fired upon by correctional officers in an attempt to gain control of the situation. Trudeau was killed by a shot from a 9mm carbine. Bagshaw was wounded, and was charged with attempted murder in regards to the incident. The OPP Prison Squad investigated the incident, and found CSC staff acted properly.\n\nAugust 11, 2014, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Millhaven Institution was on lockdown to facilitate a major search. Containers that store cereal had gone missing, and was of concern enough to lock down the prison. During the lockdown a serious inmate-on-inmate assault took place.\n\nDavid Martin, a manager at Millhaven, was arrested in August 2010 and convicted of smuggling various narcotics into the prison, apparently in connection with the Hells Angels. He was found dead in his home on August 21, 2011.\n\nIn late April 2013, the Canadian Press acquired freedom of information documents indicating that Federal Public Safety Minister, Vic Toews overruled the Millhaven warden, who had approved a radio interview with Omar Khadr.\n\nIn February 2014, an investigation was launched by the Office of the Correctional Investigator of Canada, due to complaints regarding the treatment of mentally ill inmates. These inmates had been transferred to Millhaven after the closure of RTC (Regional Treatment Centre) at Kingston Penitentiary. Photos released to the public show questionable facilities and cleanliness in that unit. Some mentally ill inmates had symptoms worsen upon arriving at Millhaven. There was also concern by the John Howard Society of Canada that the underground \"bunker-like\" location was a very negative atmosphere for these inmates.\n\nMillhaven MSU inmates can gain employment in the CORCAN industries shop. Furniture for federal government offices is fabricated there. Inmates receive a small daily wage for this work, approximately $5 a day. Room and board fees are charged to these workers. \n\nIn April 2006, a new division was created to house inmates being held on security certificates. It has been dubbed \"Guantanamo North\". Omar Khadr was transferred to Millhaven from Guantanamo Bay on September 28, 2012, and subsequently transferred to Edmonton Maximum Security Penitentiary on May 28, 2013, due to threats made on his life in Millhaven. Members of a 2006 terrorist plot to attack Canadian targets are incarcerated at Millhaven.\n\nThe song \"38 Years Old\" by The Tragically Hip refers to an escape from the prison. The opening lines of the song say \"12 men broke loose in '73, from Millhaven Maximum Security.\" There was such an escape in 1972. The lyrics of the song were changed to '73 to rhyme with \"maximum security\", and there were 14 escapees not 12. The remainder of the song alludes to fiction.\n\nThe track \"Caller Go Ahead\" on Canadian performer Bruce McCulloch's 2002 comedy album \"Drunk Baby Project\" features a caller on a sports radio show who is not able to watch televised games while at Millhaven.\n\nStephen Reid (bank robber of The Stopwatch Gang fame) stated that he was told by an aboriginal inmate whilst incarcerated at Millhaven in 1971 that it was built on a native burial ground. This meant the prison would be forever cursed, and a place of turmoil.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1998655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998655", "title": "Ron Fraser", "text": "Ron Fraser\n\nRonald Fraser (June 25, 1933 – January 20, 2013) was the college baseball coach at the University of Miami from 1963 to 1992.\n\nNicknamed the \"Wizard of College Baseball,\" he was one of the most successful coaches in NCAA baseball history, and was also responsible for bringing college baseball to a new level of public awareness. The Miami Hurricanes baseball team went from being on the brink of being \"contracted\" to being the toast of college baseball under Fraser's tenure.\n\nBorn and reared in Nutley, New Jersey, Fraser was a three-sport letterman at Nutley High School where he graduated in 1953. After graduation, he played baseball for Florida State University from 1954 to 1956 as a relief pitcher. At Florida State he joined Theta Chi. After that he was in the Army for some years, stationed in Germany and the Netherlands. He became manager of the national team of Germany and after the 1958 European championship, he managed the Netherlands until 1963. In 1963, Fraser took a head coaching job with the University of Miami, a school which did not offer its baseball players a scholarship. Even though the school did not begin to offer scholarships until 1973, Fraser built a respectable program through hard work and endless promotions. Some of the people Fraser brought in to bring publicity to the program were Major League Baseball Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Stan Musial, as well as announcer Joe Garagiola. In 1974, Miami was runner-up to the University of Southern California, a perennial college baseball powerhouse. The previous year, Miami started a record streak of consecutive postseason appearances in college baseball, a record which as of the 2016 season is still being added to. Also in 1973, Mark Light Stadium was built in large part to efforts by Fraser to build a privately funded stadium.\n\nThe 1980s were a time of great change in Miami athletics. The Miami Hurricanes football team, considered the team of the decade by many pundits, won championships in 1983, 1987 and 1989. While the success of Miami football seemed to eclipse much of the success of the baseball program, '80s Miami baseball was in many ways, the golden era of Fraser's Miami Hurricanes. Miami won its first two college world series in 1982 and 1985. While opponents' fans often criticized Hurricane football fans for not selling out the Orange Bowl. Mark Light Stadium was almost always a full house for Hurricane baseball games and Fraser's Hurricanes drew 1.27 million fans in the '80s, the best in college baseball. In 1992, Fraser retired as coach of Miami baseball, and for a short time was head of the U.S. Amateur National Baseball Team. The building that houses the baseball offices is named after him, the Ron Fraser Building.\n\nFraser's impact on college baseball, University of Miami athletics, and college athletics in general is hard to overestimate. In the mid 1970s when Hurricane football was on the verge of being eliminated, Fraser's resurrection of Miami baseball was a useful model. The University knew that with the right football coach in place, Miami could do the same thing in football that it did in baseball. Without that model, Miami might have just dropped football unceremoniously. Fraser was also instrumental in lobbying ESPN to broadcast college baseball games, something which is now part of their rotation of spring sports. Fraser also helped get the momentum going to reinstate Miami's dormant basketball program which has seen sporadic success. Ron Fraser's special gift for promotion has served as a model for many college Olympic sports programs around the country which have traditionally had difficulty attracting spectators.\n\nFraser died on January 20, 2013 at his home in Weston, Florida of complications from Alzheimer's disease.\n\n"}

His early philosophical interests were in 19th century German philosophy, particularly GWF Hegel, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Karl Marx. In the period before the Second World War, he came to know Paul Éluard, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, André Breton, and Paul Valéry. During the war, he was a prisoner and escaped. Then he became a member of the Resistance near the city of Lyon in the \"Service Périclès\".\n\nIn 1946, as Heidegger's continued teaching privileges came into question by the denazification committees, he made Beaufret's acquaintance. Beaufret engaged Heidegger on the development of French existentialism, and Heidegger wrote the \"Letter on Humanism\" (Brief über den Humanismus) to Beaufret in response. Beaufret took his students to visit Heidegger at Todtnauberg in 1947 following a month-long Franco-German academic exchange at Freiburg im Breisgau, while Baden-Württemberg was still under French occupation. Jean-François Lyotard, one of the group of students on the trip selected to visit Heidegger, wrote about the experience thus:\n\nBeaufret remained a close associate of Heidegger's, and it was through Beaufret that Heidegger became aware of Jacques Derrida's work.\n\nHe was \"a legendary professor of philosophy, having trained generations of students and future professors\" (D. Pettigrew and F. Raffoul, \"French Interpretations of Heidegger\", p. 6).\n\nBeaufret is considered the wellspring of \"orthodox French Heideggerianism,\" which was the element of French philosophy that was most dismissive of Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism after the French publication in 1987 of Víctor Farías's \"Heidegger and Nazism\". One reason for Beaufret's dismissal of Farías may have been the latter's revealing that Beaufret, according to Farías, had written in agreement with the holocaust denial of Robert Faurisson (however such interpersonal relations are exaggerated given that Beaufret's interest in Heidegger's thought was central to his own philosophical growth as a thinker, and his focus was mainly on the conceptual merits of Heideggerianism). In a letter sent to Faurisson, Beaufret is quoted as saying:\n\n\"I believe that for my part I have traveled approximately the same path as you and have been considered suspect for having expressed the same doubts [concerning the existence of the gas chambers]. Fortunately for me, this was done orally.\" Also Jacques Derrida was shocked by Beaufret's anti-Semitic tirade against Emmanuel Levinas. replied that Beaufret actually wrote this letter in 1978, long before Faurisson declared himself as a true negationist, so that he is absolutely not denying the Holocaust (this is demonstrably untrue; Faurisson had published 2 Holocaust-denying articles in 1978 already, and had denounced \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" as forgery the same year). Beaufret wrote the letter only because Faurisson, who was a former student of his, had been violently attacked in the street. Concerning the so-called anti-Semitic tirade, Jacques Derrida actually didn't hear it : this was reported to him by a friend, Roger Laporte, and Beaufret denied it completely.\n\n\n"}

He has Irish and Italian ancestry.\n\nAt age 20, Lohan became a Wall Street trader on the door of the commodity exchange.\n\nLohan married Dina, a former singer and dancer, on November 2, 1985. Dina and Michael Lohan have four children: daughters Lindsay (born July 2, 1986) and Aliana (born December 22, 1993), and sons Michael, Jr. (born 1987) and Dakota \"Cody\" (born June 16, 1996). The parents separated when their daughter Lindsay was three, and later reunited. Dina filed for divorce on January 18, 2005. In August 2007, the former couple announced a final divorce settlement had been reached, with the divorce scheduled to be finalized three months later. Dina was granted custody of their two youngest children, Ali and Cody.\n\nOn June 30, 2008, Lohan submitted a DNA sample for a paternity test after a Montana massage therapist, Kristi Kaufmann Horn, stated she was intimately involved with Michael in 1995 while he was separated from Dina, and fathered her daughter, Ashley Horn. The paternity results were revealed as positive during his appearance on \"Trisha\" where Lohan reunited with Kaufmann while meeting Horn for the first time.\n\nLohan and former tabloid reporter Kate Major became engaged over Easter weekend in 2010. They later broke up, but their continued relationship, which was marked by conflict, was depicted in the fifth season of the VH1 reality TV series, \"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew\", which documented Lohan's rehabilitation for alcoholism, which he said began in 1982. Lohan says that although he had not done cocaine in six years at this point (a \"culture\" to which he says he succumbed while working on Wall Street), \"Drinking always led to coke. Always.\" He also discussed how he was affected by the verbal abuse and alcoholism of his father, who had recently died of stomach cancer.\n\nIt was also revealed on \"Celebrity Rehab\" that Lohan had been diagnosed with left main cardiac disease. Although Lohan had previously had a blockage in his right coronary artery, the blockage at his left main coronary artery placed Lohan at high risk for a cardiac event, and required him to avoid stress and anger.\n\nIn 2011, Lohan lived in West Hollywood, California. As of February 2014, Lohan lived in Boca Raton, Florida with his wife Kate, whom he married in October 2014, and their sons, Landon Major Lohan (born January 30, 2013) and Logan Michael Lohan (born December 31, 2014). Prior to moving to Boca Raton, he lived in Fort Lauderdale and at the Tahitian Inn in Tampa.\n\nLohan and his wife lost custody of both their children in November 2015. In December 2015, Kate filed for legal separation from Lohan.\n\nIn 1990, Lohan was investigated for insider trading and convicted of criminal contempt of court. He was sentenced to three years in jail in Nassau County, and was released in 1993 on five years probation. During this time, his daughter Lindsay had started modeling for the Ford Models agency and was starring in commercials, and by the time of his release in 1993, she was at the pinnacle of her career.\n\nIn 1997, Lohan was arrested when he violated his probation after flying to Napa, California to visit his daughter Lindsay, who had been hospitalized for an asthma attack that occurred during the filming of a movie. He subsequently served a year in prison.\n\nAfter Lindsay became a movie star, tensions arose in the family. This conflict came to a head when Dina's youngest brother, Matt Sullivan, got into a fistfight outside Lohan's Long Island home, during a May 23, 2004 first communion party for their son Dakota. Lohan was charged with attempted assault and, while awaiting sentencing, was involved in a car accident that led to his being charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. While in prison, he took up singing and songwriting, as well as correspondence courses for Teen Challenge, a faith-based sobriety program. Michael and Dina Lohan separated again later that year. Lohan was later arrested on June 29 after allegedly leaving a Long Island hotel where he had rented several suites without paying his $3,800 bill, and faced assault charges in Manhattan for allegedly swearing at a sanitation worker and punching the worker in the face after the worker's truck blocked his car. On January 19, 2005, Dina's spokesperson confirmed that she had filed for divorce.\n\nLohan was released from prison in March 2007 after serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence in the Collins Correctional Facility. He subsequently took up residence in a Teen Challenge center in West Babylon, New York, and underwent training to become a minister, though to be ordained requires his parole to end.\n\nHe subsequently worked as an actor and counselor with the Long Island Teen Challenge rehabilitation program. He has also been involved in various television proposals, including the \"Michael Lohan Reality Project\", a 2007 series produced by Frozen Pictures, which followed his life, work and efforts to reconnect with his daughter and family.\n\nOn October 25, 2011, Lohan was arrested in a suspected domestic violence incident in Tampa, Florida, involving his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Kate Major. Lohan was released from custody on $5,000 bail and ordered to have no further contact with Major. On October 27, 2011, he was again in police custody after contacting Major by phone. After being subsequently released from a Tampa hospital October 28, 2011, and taken to Falkenburg Road Jail, Lohan was denied bail the next day.\n\nAll television appearances are of self. \n"}

At 9 pm that evening, she called the New Zealand Police using the 1-1-1 emergency telephone number, expressing fears for her safety.\n\nAlthough a patrol car could have been made available to attend this incident, police decided to call a taxi for Asher to pick her up. Police said later that people sometimes obtained a free ride home in a police car after making a false emergency call. A taxi was dispatched, but it went to the wrong street in Onehunga, on the other side of the city from Piha. Asher was later found wandering the streets by a Piha couple, Julia Woodhouse and Bobbie Carroll, who took her into their home for several hours. At 1:10 am, she left their home and was subsequently seen by others, semi-clad, walking towards the beach. She ran off before she could be approached. This was the last known sighting of her.\n\nAsher's family told police that she suffered from bipolar disorder.\n\nIn May 2005, Asher's family held a memorial service for her, telling mourners that if police had responded properly to her emergency call, she might be alive today.

No legal proceedings were ever commenced by her parents.\n\nAn inquest into her disappearance began on 17 July 2012. The police investigation into her disappearance found that she most likely drowned. During the inquest, the coroner criticised Woodhouse and Carroll for not calling the police themselves. The High Court subsequently found that the suggestion that their failure to call the police had contributed to Asher's death was based on speculation.\n"}
{"id": "1998676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998676", "title": "Nicholas D. Wolfwood", "text": "Nicholas D. Wolfwood\n\n, also known as Nicholas the Punisher, is a major character in the \"Trigun\" manga series created by Yasuhiro Nightow, as well as its anime adaptation. He is a priest who wields a large cross-shaped gun named the Punisher, which he and his former colleagues use either in saving people or for complete destruction.\n\nWolfwood ranked number 10 in the 1998 Annual Anime Grand Prix for Male Character.\n\nThough Vash the Stampede, the protagonist of Trigun, was Nightow's original creation, Wolfwood on the other hand came from an outside inspiration. There's a band named \"Wolfwood,\" and he took the lead singer as his image for the priest. He's also modeled on Tortoise Matsumoto from the band Ulfuls. Nightow really liked the shape of his sharp, curved down nose. Nightow jokes that as some of us might have noticed, he spent a lot of time sculpting Wolfwood's nose.\nNightow noted that the project he's really proud of is actually Wolfwood's life and death, and the storyline around it. His outfit was made simple and Nightow prevented himself from adding a lot of stuff, commenting that if he did, he'll be hard to draw.\n\nWolfwood's middle name is never stated, but Nightow has given varying answers in interviews when asked the question by fans, such as \"Dangerous\" and \"\"Dokonokuminomonjawaresumakinishiteshizumetarokakora\"\", Yakuza slang which translates to \"What the hell family do you think you're from!? I'm gonna tie you up in a reed mat and dunk ya!\" After Wolfwood showed potential in the orphanage in which he is raised, Chapel (also known as Master C) took him into the Eye of Michael, an organization of assassins founded by a plant worshipper, and trained and modified Wolfwood to be a killer. The modifications gave him enhanced abilities and the ability to regenerate from heavy injuries using special vials, but as a result caused him to age at an accelerated rate, giving him the appearance of being middle-aged though he is only in his late teens by the start of the series.\nHis potential was recognized as exceptional, and so he was given the tenth incarnation of the organization's most powerful, a special large cross-shaped gun called the Punisher, which becomes his official title within the Eye of Michael. Wolfwood later betrayed and shot Chapel, impersonating Chapel to gain entry into the Gung-Ho-Guns in an attempt to kill Millions Knives. He failed, and was instead sent by Knives to guide and protect Vash on the latter's travels to Knives's base, thus killing fellow Guns Rai-Dei the Blade and Gray the Ninelives. After Vash is taken prisoner in the Ark, Wolfwood rescues him and later departs to December to protect the orphanage from the retaliation. He battles his childhood friend, Livio, and his crippled master in a two volume face off. He manages to mortally wound Chapel and defeat Livio The Double Fang and Razlo the Tri-Punisher of Death, but having overdosed on the regenerative vials, he soon dies while having a last drink with Vash.\n\nIn the anime, Wolfwood is raised by an abusive guardian, whom he later shoots and kills. He is taken in by Chapel the Evergreen, who trains him to become his eventual successor in the Gung-Ho Guns. He meets Vash while he is stranded in the desert, and the two join forces. During the course of the series, Wolfwood develops a relationship with Milly Thompson that crosses from close friendship into romance. Wolfwood's purpose is to raise money for the children in the orphanage he runs, trying to keep other children from suffering as he did in his own childhood. He initially holds the ideals that he must kill, though he eventually comes to accept Vash's ideals. He eventually fights his master, but spares him after defeating him. Legato Bluesummers controls Chapel and forces him to shoot Wolfwood, who stumbles into a church. He spends his last moments reflecting on his life and making a final confession before dying. He shouted out his last words in a confused manner: \"I did not want to die this way!\" But after saying this, there is a long silence as he comes to a final realization, and dies with a smile on his face. He died leaning against his weapon, showing irony in that his weapon which took so many lives is shaped like a Cross and ends up being the only object holding him up after he dies.\n\nIt has been theorized that Wolfwood may possess 2 versions of the Punisher, as the number of pistols the Punisher can carry is inconsistent (holding 4 per arm in the first appearance and then 6 in the next). However, this is likely simply a continuity error.\n\nVash takes Wolfwood's gun as an act of honor, and ends up using it against Knives after he hears Wolfwood's voice.\n\nHe is a priest; however, he spent the greater part of his life training to be an assassin under a priest he looked up to. He hardly ever feels any remorse for killing, especially when it's to protect the innocent. He and Vash have some minor disagreements on this matter, which is somewhat ironic due to their occupations as gunfighters. He frequently shows his frustration at an inability to live up to Vash's non-killing lifestyle, demonstrating the guilt he has for taking others’ lives, even while doing it for good purposes. He particularly looks out for kids, making sure that none ever suffer like he did, and his primary objective has always been to make money for his orphanage.\n\nThe Punisher is a large cross-shaped gun wielded by the best members of the Eye of Michael, most commonly seen is Nicholas D. Wolfwood. There are supposedly only ten in existence and Wolfwood's Punisher is the tenth one in creation. His Punisher has two machine guns in front and a rocket launcher in the back. In the anime, the side arms of the cross open up to reveal a storage bin for pistols. After Wolfwood dies, Vash inherits the weapon, and uses it in his battle with Knives. Nightow commented on the Punisher being around a \"\"hundred-and-so\"\" kilograms and Wolfwood having an \"incredible sense of balance\". It has been noted by many characters that the Punisher is a very heavy weapon. Wolfwood commented on this with \"That's because it's full of mercy\".\n\nMany other Punishers appeared in the series and other of Nightow's work. The Chapel Gun, used by Mr. C against his fight with Wolfwood in the manga, is a large cross-shaped machine gun with four spiked ends at the base of the cross. Wolfwood's friend Livio wields the Double Fangs, two cross-shaped submachine guns with dual barrels that make them capable of firing forward and backward at once; these guns are typically strapped to his wrists and, later, carried in low-slung shoulder holsters when not in use. Livio's alternate personality, Razlo the Tri-Punisher of Death, wielded, as his name suggests, three punishers. When he was in his Livio state, they were carried by his three henchmen, Agile, Zain, and a third, unnamed henchman. The Punisher's cross design bears a resemblance to the Centerhead weapon from , another Nightow work. The Centerhead was wielded by Fangoram (a henchman working for the game's antagonist) and was used in the same way as Wolfwood's.\n\nWhile Christians do not perform confessions(source?) , and Wolfwood continually insinuates confession is part of his purpose, Wolfwood's primary occupation is being a Christian priest, and his clothes and main weapon is of Christian themes. Nightow is generally known as one of the few successful Christian manga artists. Most of the Japanese population is not Christian, but Trigun itself is full of themes and ideas that have connections to Christianity. Nightow grew up as a Buddhist, but studied Catholicism and converted to it, while retaining Buddhist principles.\n\nThere are many Christian themes [please replace] found much in the manga and anime. Even though being a gunman Wolfwood takes his faith greatly in mind, but unlike Vash who is much of pacifist, Wolfwood believes himself to be a realist and that violence and killings are a part of life. When questioned about this, he always replies, \"I've always chosen the right path, haven't I?\" Wolfwood actions can be seen with other of his Biblical predecessors. There is John the Baptist, a non-conforming ambassador for Christ, who walked around in the wilderness, much like Wolfwood hiked through the desert. St. Peter used gratuitous violence to save Jesus, rather like Wolfwood perhaps unnecessarily shooting down Zazie the Beast to save Vash. Jesus rebuked Peter by saying, \"He who lives by the sword dies by the sword\". In the manga and anime that is also how Wolfwood was killed, dying by his weapon. Samson from the Old Testament lived life wildly and violently, killing because of grudges, and carrying on outside of marriage with the two-faced Delilah. Yet God used him as a Judge for His people. Wolfwood also lives wildly and violently, yet is able to be used for good. The Book of Judges remarks about Samson's time that \"in those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\" Sometimes seen as Wolfwood is taking that verse to heart in a lawless land. He can also be referenced to St. Paul, who traveled through unknown land to spread Christianity, just like Wolfwood travelling through a harsh planet to save his orphanage and people he came across.\n\nAnime Source ranked Wolfwood #75th in their Top 100 Anime Characters Survey based on 19 votes. Saying that \"Wolfwood is the father of all badass, gun-toting priests. He is completely unorthodox in his methods, but still dedicated to his ministry in his own absurd way. Totally respecting this guy because not everyone can mesh coolness and priesthood with such finesse.\"\n\nMania.com listed him in 9th place in their 10 Biggest Bad Ass Anime Gunslingers, commenting that \"Wearing the clothes of a priest and carrying a cross on his back Wolfwood roams the desert planet of Gunsmoke. His cross truly represents death not only in its symbolic meaning but also in the fact that it is one giant arsenal itself. It contains a machine gun function and rocket launcher as well as containing a rack of handguns in the anime. Before Wolfwood met Vash, he was a do whatever it takes individual who had no problem with dispensing lead as for his sacraments and introducing those in his way to God in a very up close manner.\" The site also listed him as the best supporting character in an anime series. Jian DeLeon of \"Complex\" magazine named him sixth on a list of \"The 25 Most Stylish Anime Characters,\" labeling him \"The epitome of \"speak softly and carry a big stick.\"\n"}

Population: 92,400 (1970).\n\nIn Finno-Ugric languages Bala-shika means \"land of celebrations, land of laughter and fun.\" Finno-Ugric peoples lived in this area before Slavs.\n\nThe city is known for its unique river and waterway system. The Pekhorka River system covers an area of from north to south and from east to west, and many small lakes and ponds were created by damming to provide water power for the cotton mills in the 19th century.\n\nBalashikha was established in 1830. It was granted town status in 1939. Several rural hamlets had existed long before on the site of the modern city.\n\nThe city stands on the famous Vladimir Highway, which led out of Moscow to the east. This was the route along which convicted criminals were marched to forced labor camps in Siberia. The road was renamed Gorky Highway in the Soviet era. The failure of the Decembrist Revolt against Tsar Nicholas I led to the execution of its ringleaders and the exile of many nobles to Siberia. Soviet-era schoolchildren were told that the prisoners were marched in chains along this road followed by their wives. In truth, the Decembrist prisoners were sent from St. Petersburg, then the capital of Russia, through Yaroslavl, and not through Moscow and Balashikha, and the story was invented as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the event in 1925.\n\nBetween 1830 and 1870, a cotton factory was in operation in the area, with its fabric called Balashikha. A railway station was built at the end of the 19th century, again called Balashikha Station.\n\nAs it grew, Balashikha absorbed other villages, including Gorenki, a suburban estate of Count Andreas Razumovsky, and Pekhra-Yakovlevskoye, an estate of Prince Galitzine, the latter being in use for 250 years from 1591 to 1828. This is the site of a stone church, built from 1777 to 1782.\n\nSaltykovka, a part of Balashikha, has long been known for its attractions to the artistic community. Isaak Levitan, the famous landscape painter, lived there in 1879. Lev Tolstoy was another frequent visitor.\n\nSeveral institutions were founded in Balashikha after the October Revolution, including one dedicated to the production of fur.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, Balashikha became a major industrial center with industries in metallurgy, aviation industry, cryogenic technology, machinery, and other fields.\n\nBalashikha sent many of its sons to the front to fight the Germans during World War II. Among those who fought and died was Ivan Flerov who commanded a Katyusha rocket division and is remembered by several monuments and museums in the area.\n\nAlong with many other Russian Orthodox Churches, the Cathedral of Saint Alexander Nevsky was demolished by the government. The Cathedral was blown up in the 1960s but was rebuilt, on its original site, in 2002.\n\nThe Balashikha Maternity House was designated on July 1, 2003, to be the Moscow Oblast Perinatal Center. This facility will now function as a regional perinatal care facility for high-risk mothers and infants and a perinatal health education center for Moscow Oblast.\n\nAlthough not part of the extensive Moscow subway system, Balashikha is home to many office workers who commute to Moscow each day. It has several thriving markets and retail centers and is quickly modernizing. It is surrounded by attractive woodland and countryside.\n\nIn January 2015, the city of Zheleznodorozhny was abolished with its territory merged into Balashikha.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with twelve rural localities, incorporated as Balashikha City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Balashikha City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Balashikha Urban Okrug.\n\nIn the past, Balashikha served as the administrative center of Balashikhinsky District. On January 1, 2011, the district was abolished.\n\nThe 2017 national rink bandy cup took place in Balashikha.\n\nThe city is home to several music schools, including the Sviridov School of Arts. Attractions include the Balashikha Arena and Moscow Radio Center 13.\n\nBalashikha is the site of a large Russian Army base and was closed to foreigners during the Soviet era, a ban which, in theory, remains to the present day. It was the headquarters of the 1st Corps of the Soviet Air Defense Forces and is now to become the headquarters of the Operational-Strategic Command for Missile-Space Defense. Balashikha is also base for ODON (Internal security division). Balashiha is home to Military Unit 35690, which is training facility used by the Federal Security Service.\n\n\nBalashikha is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1998687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998687", "title": "Legato Bluesummers", "text": "Legato Bluesummers\n\nLegato Bluesummers (レガート・ブルーサマーズ|Regāto Burūsamāzu) is an antagonist in the manga and anime Trigun created by Yasuhiro Nightow voiced by Toshihiko Seki in Japanese and Richard Cansino in English. Throughout the series he serves as the right-hand man of the main antagonist Millions Knives and an enemy to Vash the Stampede.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the manga, Legato was a nameless slave. While imprisoned, he slowly developed his power by weaving metal threads into his brain, allowing him to take control of other bodies. Before he could fully develop his power, he was discovered, wounded, and raped. However, Knives happened to pass by and destroy the city, with Legato being the only survivor thanks to the power of his threads. Legato immediately becomes infatuated with Knives and swears eternal loyalty, showing his willingness to allow Knives to kill him. Knives takes the boy in as a tool, and presumably names him. Later, Legato and Dr. Conrad, a friend of Knives, found July City in ruins and Knives heavily wounded. Legato sees Vash in the distance, and realizes Vash is the cause of Knives's serious injury, but Conrad convinces Legato to help tend to the wounded Knives instead of chasing after Vash. Seeing Knives in such a state traumatizes Legato, who swears revenge on Vash, eventually leading Legato to plan a killing game to torment and eventually kill Vash.\n\nLegato first appears in the manga claiming to be a messenger, introducing Vash to his proposed killing game. He warns that Vash will be pursued by \"demons\" who are intent on killing him. Legato leaves Vash a Coin Case, telling Vash that each of these assassins will be carrying a coin. He tells Vash that once he has collected all of the coins something will happen. When Vash asks his name and how he knows these things, Legato formally introduces himself and then hints that Knives sent him. Legato later watches the battle between Vash and the first two members of the mercenary group Gung-ho Guns, Monev the Gale and E. G. Mine. Upon defeating Mine, Vash challenges Legato, stating that he intends to reverse their roles of hunter and hunted in Legato's twisted coin game.\n\nLegato first demonstrates his ability to control the bodies of others in a restaurant. When assaulted by a group of slave traders, Legato uses his powers to kill the man by forcing him to tear out his own heart. He then kills the other men that had been with him by making them shoot each other. Legato tells the women that they are free now and warns them to be careful as \"humanity will soon come to an end\". Leaving the restaurant, Legato realizes that his previous action was an unusual display of emotion on his part, and that Vash's challenge has greatly bothered him.\n\nFollowing the battle between Vash and the third member of the Guns, Dominique the Cyclops, Legato gathers with The Gung-Ho Guns for Knives's reawakening at the place called Jenora Rock, which Vash senses and rushes to. Upon being reawakened, Knives twists Legato's neck in a 180 degree angle and then breaks his limbs when Legato instinctively moves to attack Vash. Elendira later comments that this was also influenced by the fact that Legato had used The Gung-Ho Guns to settle his personal vendetta against Vash, and that it is amazing that Knives should decide Legato's life worth sparing at all. Legato's wounded body is then placed in a coffin that is chained shut except for the head area. He uses his controlling powers on a large ogre creature to serve as his transportation. The creature is killed and Legato forcibly taken back by Elendira following the battle between Vash and Hoppered, and Legato is placed in a new coffin with primitive metal limbs.\n\nWhen Vash and Wolfwood finally reach Knives, Legato uses his abilities to restrain Vash as a prisoner for eight months straight, which greatly weakens him. Wolfwood later betrays the Guns and rescues Vash, shooting the weakened Legato in the back of the head. The wounded Legato is left in a catatonic state, with his body slowing breaking down. However, Legato reveals a full recovery in time to save Knives from Zazie the Beast, where it is revealed his power functions through the use of microscopic strings that connects his mind to the muscles of his victims. While in confinement in his coffin, Legato developed his power further to restore his broken body to functional form. In the final stage of Knives's plan, Legato faces off against Vash in order to prevent Vash from getting to Knives, revealing that the now completed Coin Case functions as a device that blocks Legato's abilities to make their battle more interesting. As Legato and Vash do battle, Legato reveals his past as a sex slave, and how he came to love and swear loyalty to Knives for destroying the city he was trapped in. Legato beats Vash so severely that it activates an automatic defense power in Vash, which severely wounds Legato. Vash destroys the coin case in an attempt to even the battle once again, and the two clash one final time, both of them pushed to the absolute limits of their strength.\n\nOnce defeated by Vash, Legato demands that Vash finish him, threatening the life of Livio and everyone else Vash holds dear. Feeling he has no choice, Vash shoots Legato in the head. Legato dies smiling.\n\nThe anime shows Legato in a less sympathetic light. In the anime, Legato is far less emotional than his manga counterpart and it is never explained why he joined Knives. Legato is simply a sadistic nihilist who is determined to torment Vash and aid Knives in his quest to eradicate humanity. He also attached Vash's arm to himself because Vash \"refused to be by his (Knives) side\". Legato has a similar introduction to the one he is given in the manga, the key difference being that in the anime Legato does not play the game with coins with Vash. Legato uses The Gung-Ho Guns to place Vash in situations where he must either kill or be killed. Vash never ends up killing though, always figuring out a way to survive without finishing anyone off. Vash still gets scarred by Legato's actions, as most of The Gung-ho Guns either get killed for failing to put an end to Vash or commit suicide because they were afraid of being punished by Knives.\n\nWhen Vash finally has Legato cornered, Legato reveals that he is going to allow Vash to kill him. Vash refuses. Legato insists that it is okay and that he has no reason to continue living. Seeing that his words are not working on Vash, he threatens to kill Milly and Meryl if Vash doesn't finish him off. Feeling like he has no other option, Vash shoots Legato in the head. Legato dies smiling, knowing that his death will scar Vash for life.\n\nIn both the manga and the anime, Legato has the ability to use psychic powers to manipulate people. He obtained these powers from Knives who gave Legato Vash's left arm, which was endowed with some of the god-like powers the brothers possess. When he does this, it is usually to make a person or a group of people do something against their will. Examples of this include when he made a group of men from the Roderick Gang kill one another, making an entire population of a town disappear, controlling Chapel the Evergreen to kill Nicholas D. Wolfwood, and cramming a group of soldiers into a tight truck by manipulating their bodies.\n\nIn the manga, Legato is also said to have the power to control threads, which are invisible barriers that can control things as well. The biggest example of when he used this was with his first encounter with Knives as a child. He used this power to survive Knives' attack and impressed the killer to allow him to be his right-hand man.\n\nLegato has been listed in Top Ten Emo Anime Characters by My Little Emo, together with Sasuke Uchiha from Naruto and L from Death Note. Listed in #5, he even has surpassed other anime villains like Light Yagami and Zero Kiryu.\n\nTwisted Jenius describes him as \"An Example of a Classic Anime Villain\", saying that Aesthetically speaking, Legato dresses the part of a proper anime villain, and has the evil smile to go along with it. In some ways, I would argue that Legato is more evil than Knives. Knives, after all, is not human; Legato is (mostly). It's a little bit understandable that Knives would wish to destroy the human race; but Legato has chosen to write off his own kind as being worthless and inferior. He also seems to be more genuinely sadistic than Knives. He takes a great deal of pleasure in using his power to dispatch other humans. Legato's purpose in life is to help his master wipe out all of humanity and to cause eternal suffering for Vash; even at the cost of his own life. This guy actually manages to psychologically torture the hero of the series from beyond the grave!\n"}

It stars Beverly Garland, Bruce Bennett, and Lon Chaney Jr. This film was the penultimate feature directed by Del Ruth, and quite different from those of his days at Warner Bros. \n\nThe film was theatrically distributed by 20th Century Fox on a double bill with \"Return of the Fly\".\n\nAfter nurse Jane Marvin (Beverly Garland) is administered the drug sodium pentothal by psychiatrists Erik Lorimer (Bennett) and Wayne McGregor (Douglas Kennedy), she recalls a series of events from her forgotten past when she was known as Joyce Webster.\n\nJoyce has just married a young man named Paul Webster (Richard Crane). Aboard their honeymoon train, Paul receives a telegram, and in a panic, immediately leaves the train to make a phone call. When the train pulls out, Paul is missing, having vanished without a word. Throughout the following months, Joyce employs private detectives and conducts her own search for her husband, to no avail, until one day she discovers the address of the Cypresses Plantation that Paul entered on his college enrollment forms.\n\nJoyce takes the next train to the desolate whistle-stop town of Bayou Landing in the heart of Louisiana swamp country. While waiting at the rail station, she notices a large crate, marked as containing radioactive cobalt, and meets Manon (Chaney Jr.), a hermit handyman at the Cypresses, when he comes to pick up the crate. She asks him to drive her there and he obliges. As they proceed deeper in the swamps, Joyce is horrified when Manon tries to run over an alligator and then exhibits the hook where a gator bit off his hand, explaining his hatred for the reptiles. At the plantation, Joyce introduces herself to Lavinia Hawthorne (Frieda Inescort), the Cypresses' stern mistress. When Joyce suggests that Paul once lived at the plantation, Lavinia calls her a liar and tries to have her thrown out. However, when her manservant Toby (Vince Townsend Jr.) points out that Joyce has missed the last train back to town, Lavinia reluctantly invites her to stay the night under the proviso that she not leave her room.\n\nThat night, in a drunken craze, Manon is in the swamps attempting to shoot several alligators. Joyce is disquieted by the sound of gunshots, but when she tries to open the door to her room, she discovers it is locked. When the maid Lou Ann (Ruby Goodwin) delivers Joyce’s dinner tray, she warns that the house is deeply troubled and advises her to leave as soon as possible. Later, Lavinia notifies Mark Sinclair (George Macready), a self-proclaimed \"Swamp Doctor\" who operates a clinic on the plantation, that Paul's wife is there. At the clinic, Mark administers an injection to an agitated patient who is swathed in bandages. Soon after, Lavinia arrives to confer about how to deal with Joyce.\n\nMeanwhile, at the house, Joyce hears the strings of a piano and slips out of her room to investigate. As she descends the stairs, she sees a man in a trench coat, his face in shadows, seated at the piano and fails to recognize the shadowy figure as mutated Paul. When Joyce enters the room, Paul flees, leaving behind a trail of muddy, clawed footprints. Paul, his face terribly disfigured, stops Lavinia's car and in a distorted voice, insists that Joyce leave as soon as possible. The next morning, Mark comes to the house to question Joyce, and sensing that he is withholding information about Paul, she refuses to leave. Later that day, when Joyce demands that Lavinia tell her what she did to Paul, the older woman breaks down and confesses that Paul is her son.\n\nThat night, as a storm rages, thinking that Joyce has gone, Paul returns to the house. When Joyce sees him, he runs away and she follows him into the swamps. After being menaced by several alligators and a giant snake blocking her path, Manon rescues and carries her to his shack. After trying to get her to strip, Manon assaults her. When Joyce screams and tries to resist, Manon angrily knocks her unconscious. An outraged, reptilian-looking Paul then bursts in and fights Manon. After a struggle, Paul manages to incapacitate Manon and takes Joyce back to the house. Manon recovers and screams out in rage into the storm, vowing to kill Paul just like he would kill any alligator no matter what. Back at the house, Lou Ann is caring for Joyce as Lavinia confronts her son. After his mother insists that Joyce be told the truth, Paul presses Mark to give him an untested cobalt treatment in hopes of curing his condition. Mark reluctantly agrees to give him the treatment the following evening after Joyce has been informed of the situation.\n\nThe next morning, Mark summons Joyce to his lab and tells her about his experiments with reptilian hormones that are capable of regenerating limbs. He continues that after Paul was horribly mangled in a plane crash, Mark administered the serum to him and several other accident victims. The treatment appeared to be a great success, until his patients began to increasingly take on reptilian traits. Mark explains that after Paul received the telegram notifying him that his tests were positive, he hurriedly left the train and came home in hopes of reversing his condition. When Joyce learns of Paul's scheduled radical cobalt treatment, she insists on being present.\n\nThat night, Paul encounters Joyce at the clinic and turns away from her in shame. After seeing Joyce clasping her son's hands and reassuring him of her love, Lavinia apologizes to her for her brusqueness. As Paul climbs onto the table and Mark aims the ray at him, Manon bursts into the lab and destroys the control panel, shooting powerful rays at Paul that transform him into a bipedal, reptilian monster with an alligator-like head. After trying to attack Manon, Paul looks on as Manon's hook gets caught on some cords and is electrocuted while trying to kill Paul. Confused, Paul stumbles over to the other room and tries to communicate, but his voice has been replaced with a reptilian snarl. Hearing his wife and mother scream in horror, Paul flees into the swamps and sadly peering into the water, sees his reflection. Joyce scrambles after him, as the cobalt machine, short circuiting due to Manon's body, self-destructs and destroys the lab. Scrambling away from his wife, Paul is attacked by an alligator and wrestles it while Joyce screams at the sight. Managing to fight off the reptile and hurl it away, Paul stumbles into quicksand and slowly sinks out of sight to the sound of Joyce’s shrieks, seemingly meeting his demise.\n\nBack in the present, the psychiatrists review the tapes of Joyce's ordeal, and concluding that her amnesia has allowed her to suppress the horror and resume a normal life, they decide not to tell her about her life as Joyce Webster.\n\n\nDeveloped for Fox as a co-feature for \"Return of the Fly\", \"The Alligator People\" was produced by Jack Leewood for Associated Producers on a budget of $300,000. It was written by Orville H.

At age fifty-three, he became the youngest four-star general in the U.S. Army's history. He succeeded General Matthew Ridgway as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR) serving from 1953 to 1956.\n\nGruenther was born in Platte Center, Nebraska, the son of Mary \"Mayme\" Shea, a school teacher, and Maximilian Gruenther, a newspaper editor who published the \"Platte Center Signal\". He attended St. Thomas Academy in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In June 1917, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point and after studying for nineteen months, graduated early due to the wartime, on 1 November 1918, with a rank of fourth in a class of 277. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery but after the Armistice he was recalled to West Point to complete his training, and graduated a second time in June 1919.\n\nUntil May 1935, when he was promoted to captain, he served various tours of duty including teaching mathematics, electricity and chemistry at West Point for eight years.\n\nIn September 1941, Gruenther, now a major, took part in the Army's Louisiana Maneuvers, the largest war exercises since World War I. Nearly 400,000 troops were involved. His performance was noticed by the Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, United States Army (GHQ), Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair.\n\nIn October 1941, Gruenther was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and became deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff of the Third Army as a colonel under Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. Gruenther's immediate commanding officer was Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the two became bridge partners.\n\nGruenther was an adviser and planner to top generals in World War II. He possessed a strong power of analytical reasoning with capacity both to detail and overall perspective for which his colleagues called him \"the Brain.\" In 1942, he was promoted to brigadier general and became a deputy chief of staff of Allied Force Headquarters in London under Gen. Eisenhower, who assigned him the Operation Torch development. A year later, he was promoted to major general and served as chief of staff of the Fifth Army, and the 15th Army Group under Gen. Mark W. Clark; he was the principal planner of the allied invasions of North Africa in 1942 and Italy in 1943.\n\nAfter the end of World War II in 1945, Gruenther served as deputy commander of U.S. forces in Austria. In 1946-1947, he was appointed deputy commandant of the recently established National War College.\n\nIn 1947, he served as Director of the Joint Staff and then Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1947-1949. In 1949, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general and served as the U.S. Army's deputy chief of staff for plans and operations.\n\nIn 1951, Gruenther was promoted to four-star general and appointed as the Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (COFS SHAPE) under Gen. Eisenhower, who became the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). He continued to serve under Gen. Matthew Ridgway and later replaced him as SACEUR. From 11 July 1953 to 20 November 1956, he was Supreme Allied Commander, Europe/Commander in Chief, U.S. European Command (SACEUR/USCINCEUR). On December 31, 1956, Gruenther retired from the Army. \n\nIn the 1956 presidential campaign, Gruenther's name was placed on the list of possible candidates for the Republican nomination after Eisenhower's heart attack on September 24, 1955. After serving two terms, President Eisenhower considered Gruenther as a possible alternative to Richard Nixon for the Republican presidential nomination in 1960, and later suggested Gruenther as a potential vice-president for Nixon, but ultimately realized that Gruenther did not have the political base required to get either place on the ticket.\n\nGruenther served on the boards of Dart Industries, Inc., New York Life Insurance Company, and Pan American World Airways. He also served on the Draper Committee and several presidential commissions on draft, health and disarmament. He was a president of the English-Speaking Union.\n\nGruenther died of complications after pneumonia at Walter Reed Army Hospital, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nIn 1922, Gruenther married Grace Elizabeth Crum of Jeffersonville, Indiana, who gave birth to two sons, Donald A. Gruenther, and Richard L. Gruenther; they both became career military officers. His great-grandson, USAF Captain Lucas Gruenther died at the age of 32 while flying F-16 jet fighter on January 28, 2013, during a training mission over the Adriatic Sea.\n\nFrom January 1957 to March 1964, he was president of the American Red Cross. As head of the Red Cross, Gruenther personally visited and inspected disaster areas in the United States. He made frequent public appearances, captivating the audience with \"easy manner and conversational style.\" He received several awards for International Red Cross related activities, which included visits to Russia and Poland.\n\nBeing a bridge practitioner, Gruenther published several books on the subject, including \"Duplicate Contract Complete: A Guide to Playing in and Conducting All Duplicate Bridge Contests\", and served as a referee at bridge national tournaments. In 1931, he refereed the Culbertson-Lenz bridge championship in New York City which was dubbed by the press as \"The Bridge Battle of the Century\". After the West Point superintendent received a complaint about a full-time officer spending nights at bridge tournament, he audited Gruenther's 8 a.m. class. The Superintendent reported to his superiors that, \"If I could be certain that being a bridge referee would have the same salutary effect on all the Military Academy's instructors as it has had on Lt. Gruenther, I would demand that they all become bridge referees in their spare time. I have never seen a finer chemistry instructor than Lt. Gruenther.\" Gruenther was considered the best bridge player in the U.S. Army, and was Dwight D. Eisenhower's favorite partner. Eisenhower was playing bridge when, in 1948, President Truman telephoned him to ask him to take the post of head of NATO, in Paris. On returning to the table, he was asked who he would appoint as his second-in-command. \"Well, I ought to take Bedell Smith, but I think I'll take Gruenther because he's the better bridge player\". He was an honorary member of the National Laws Commission of the American Contract Bridge League. He served as honorary president of the World Bridge Federation 1958-78.\n\nGen. Eisenhower characterized Gruenther as \"one of the ablest all-around officers, civilian or military, I have encountered.\" Gruenther served with distinction as staff officer in U.S. military operations in the Mediterranean theater of World War II in 1942-1945, and as supreme Allied commander in Europe, during the Cold War in 1953-1956.\n\nIn 1952, Gruenther became the youngest four-star general in U.S. history He is also sometimes credited to be the youngest major general in the U.S. Army in World War II, but that distinction belongs to James M. Gavin, who, as commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, was promoted to major general at the age of 37.\n\nGruenther was featured on the Time's cover on February 6, 1956. He appeared as a guest on February 10, 1957, on the popular TV quiz show What's My Line and on March 10, 1957 \"Meet the Press\" program.\n\nGruenther was the recipient of many national medals, including the Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, and honorary degrees from several American universities, including a Litt.D. from Bates College (1958). Altogether, he had honorary degrees from 38 universities and colleges and decorations from 20 nations.\n\n\n\n"}

It is linked to many neurological and psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, ADHD, addictive behaviors, Parkinson's disease, and eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. A weak association has been drawn between DRD4 and borderline personality disorder.\n\nIt is also a target for drugs which treat schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. The D receptor is considered to be D-like in which the activated receptor inhibits the enzyme adenylate cyclase, thereby reducing the intracellular concentration of the second messenger cyclic AMP.\n\nThe human protein is coded by the \"DRD4\" on chromosome 11 located in 11p15.5.\n\nThere are slight variations (mutations/polymorphisms) in the human gene:\n\nMutations in this gene have been associated with various behavioral phenotypes, including autonomic nervous system dysfunction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and the personality trait of novelty seeking.\n\nThe 48-base pair variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in exon 3 range from 2 to 11 repeats. Dopamine is more potent at the D4 receptor with 2 allelic repeat or 7 allelic repeats than the variant with 4 allelic repeats.\n\nDRD4-7R, the 7-repeat (7R) variant of \"DRD4\" (DRD4 7-repeat polymorphism), has been linked to a susceptibility for developing ADHD in several meta-analyses and other psychological traits and disorders. Adults and children with the DRD4 7-repeat polymorphism show variations in auditory-evoked gamma oscillations, which may be related to attention processing.\n\nThe frequency of the alleles varies greatly between populations, e.g., the 7-repeat version has high incidence in America and low in Asia. \"Long\" versions of polymorphisms are the alleles with 6 to 10 repeats. 7R appears to react less strongly to dopamine molecules.\n\nThe 48-base pair VNTR has been the subject of much speculation about its evolution and role in human behaviors cross-culturally. The 7R allele appears to have been selected for about 40,000 years ago. In 1999 Chen and colleagues observed that populations who migrated farther in the past 30,000 to 1,000 years ago had a higher frequency of 7R/long alleles. They also showed that nomadic populations had higher frequencies of 7R alleles than sedentary ones. More recently it was observed that the health status of nomadic Ariaal men was higher if they had 7R alleles. However, in recently sedentary (non-nomadic) Ariaal those with 7R alleles seemed to have slightly deteriorated health.\n\nDespite early findings of an association between the \"DRD4\" 48bp VNTR and novelty seeking (a normal characteristic of exploratory and excitable people), a 2008 meta-analysis compared 36 published studies of novelty seeking and the polymorphism and found no effect. Results are consistent with novelty-seeking behavior being a complex trait associated with many genes, and the variance attributable to \"DRD4\" by itself being very small. The meta-analysis of 11 studies did find that another polymorphism in the gene, the -521C/T, showed an association with novelty seeking. While human results are not strong, research in animals has suggested stronger associations and new evidence suggests that human encroachment may exert selection pressure in favor of \"DRD4\" variants associated with novelty seeking.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that agonists that activate the D4 receptor increase working memory performance and fear acquisition in monkeys and rodents according to a U-shaped dose response curve. However, antagonists of the D4 receptor reverse stress-induced or drug-induced working memory deficits. Gamma oscillations, which may be correlated with cognitive processing, can be increased by D4R agonists, but are not significantly reduced by D4R antagonists.\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that parenting may affect the cognitive development of children with the 7-repeat allele of \"DRD4\". Parenting that has maternal sensitivity, mindfulness, and autonomy–support at 15 months was found to alter children's executive functions at 18 to 20 months. Children with poorer quality parenting were more impulsive and sensation seeking than those with higher quality parenting. Higher quality parenting was associated with better executive control in 4-year-olds.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Wilson was serving as President of the Board of Health.\n\nAs a result of its consolidation with the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services, it was renamed the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene on July 29, 2002.\n\nIn October, 2017, public health and animal rights activists in New York City launched a campaign to compel Health Commissioner Mary Bassett to enforce seven public health codes violated during Kaporos, a ritual animal sacrifice that takes place before Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. From October 2017 to May 2018, the activists disrupted four of her public speaking engagements and staged four protests in the lobby of the NYC Department of Health (DOH). The activists allege that Commissioner Bassett is turning a blind eye to the health code violations because the ultra-Orthodox Jews who practice the ritual represent a powerful voting bloc. During Kaporos, an estimated 60,000 six-week old chickens are intensively confined in crates without food or water for up to several days before being ritually slaughtered. Activists claim that many die of starvation, thirst and exposure before the ritual takes place, but there is no evidence of this. While activists claim the birds are discarded after slaughter, they are typically used for food and often donated to the poor. A toxicology reported submitted to the court as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the DOH states that the ritual poses a risk to public health in the neighborhoods where it takes place. While Commissioner Bassett did not publicly acknowledge the toxicology report or the activists’ claims about the health code violations, she issued a public statement asserting that “there remains no evidence that the use of chickens for Kaporos poses a significant risk to human health.”\n\nOn February 14, 2020 during an interview with MSNBC regarding the Covid-19 outbreak, Dr. Oxiris Barbot incorrectly stated \"The coronavirus is part of a family of known viruses. There are four strains that we see commonly here in New York City and across the country that cause the flu.\" This statement from the commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was misleading because coronaviruses and influenza viruses are not closely related, being classified in entirely different phyla.\n\n\nThe New York City Board of Health is part of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and consists of the commissioner of the department, the chairperson of the department's Mental Hygiene Advisory Board, and nine other members appointed by the mayor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1998796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998796", "title": "The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp", "text": "The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\n\nThe Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp is the first Western television series written for adults, premiering four days before \"Gunsmoke\" on September 6, 1955. Two weeks later came the Clint Walker western \"Cheyenne\". The series is loosely based on the life of frontier marshal Wyatt Earp. The half-hour, black-and-white program aired for six seasons (229 episodes) on ABC from 1955 to 1961, with Hugh O'Brian in the title role.\n\nThe first season of the series purports to tell the story of Wyatt's experiences as deputy town marshal of Ellsworth, Kansas (first four episodes) and then as town marshal in Wichita. In the second episode of the second season, first aired September 4, 1956, he is hired as assistant city marshal of Dodge City, where the setting remained for three seasons. The final episode set in Dodge City (Season 5, Episode 1 - \"Dodge City: Hail and Farewell\") aired on September 1, 1959. Beginning the next week on September 8, 1959 (Season 5, Episode 2 - \"The Trail to Tombstone\"), the locale shifted to Tombstone, Arizona Territory, for the remainder of the series.\n\n\nOn September 25, 1956, Myron Healey played a drunken gunfighter Clay Allison, who comes into Dodge City to confront the Earp legend. In the story line, Pete Albright, a storeowner played by Charles Fredricks, tries to hire Allison to gun down Earp because the marshal is fighting crime in the town and costing merchants business in the process. Allison makes a point of not taking money, but is willing to challenge Earp until he is overcome by his own drunkenness. Mike Ragan played Clay Allison in a 1957 episode, \"The Time for All Good Men\".\n\nOther notable performers were Rachel Ames (in the 1958 episode \"The Schoolteacher\"), Jim Bannon (three times), Roy Barcroft (three times), Lane Bradford (six times, including the role of the Cheyenne Chief Two Moon in the 1957 episode \"Indian Wife\"), Robert Bray (three times), Virginia Christine, Andy Clyde (as Billy Buckett), Tris Coffin, Elisha Cook, Jr. (as gunsmith \"Guns\" McCallum in \"The Equalizer\"), Carolyn Craig (as Edna Granger in \"County Seat War\"), Francis De Sales (three times), Richard Devon (twice), Tiger Fafara, Ron Foster (as Johnny in \"Arizona Lottery\"), Robert Fuller, Connie Gilchrist (in \"Pinkytown\", the story of an outlying saloon community which resists annexation into Dodge City), Ron Hagerthy, Robert Harland, and Brad Johnson (twice, as Bat Masterson's brother Ed Masterson in the 1957 episode \"The Nice Ones Always Die First\" and as the artist Hurley Abbott in the 1958 segment \"The Underdog\").\n\nStill more guest stars included Ed Hinton, Jonathan Hole (twice), Rodolfo Hoyos, Jr., I. Stanford Jolley (six times, including \"A Papa for Butch and Ginger\"), Brett King (twice), Jimmy Lydon (twice), Walter Maslow (as the outlaw Blackie Saunders), Francis McDonald (in \"Old Jake\", a story of revenge stemming from the Sand Creek massacre), Tyler McVey (seven times), Carol Ohmart (as actress Cora Campbell), Gregg Palmer (five times as Tom McLowery), House Peters, Jr. (four times as Wichita saloon owner Dave Bennett), John M. Pickard (three times, once as the gunfighter Johnny Ringo), Paula Raymond, Grant Richards (as gunfighter and saloonkeeper Luke Short), Roy Roberts (as the Texas cattle baron Shanghai Pierce\n), Thayer Roberts (as General William Tecumseh Sherman), Bing Russell (twice), Stuart Randall (seven times), Isabel Randolph (as Grandma Wilkins in \"Wyatt Earp Rides Shotgun\"), Glenn Strange (five times), Gloria Talbott, John Vivyan, Gloria Winters, Sheb Wooley (twice), and Anna May Wong. Frank Stillwell was portrayed by John Baxter in season 5.\n\nThe series was produced by Desilu Productions and filmed at the Desilu-Cahuenga Studio. Sponsors included General Mills, Procter & Gamble, and Parker Pen Company. An off-camera barbershop quartet sang the theme song and hummed the background music in early episodes. The theme song \"The Legend of Wyatt Earp\" was composed by Harry Warren. Incidental music was composed by Herman Stein.\n\nO'Brian was chosen for the role in part because of his physical resemblance to early photographs of Wyatt Earp.\n\nThe series had a large supporting cast of more than 30 actors during its six-year run. Jimmy Noel was cast in 144 episodes as an unnamed, uncredited townsman; Buddy Roosevelt appeared similarly in 65 episodes of the series. William Tannen played Deputy Hal Norton in 56 episodes which aired between 1956 and 1958; in some of the segments he was uncredited, and in most his role was tangential to the script. Randy Stuart was cast in 12 episodes in the 1959–1960 season as Tombstone saloon and hotel owner Nellie Cashman, a romantic interest for Earp. Earlier she played Nellie Dawson, a widow living on a ranch, in \"Little Gray Home in the West\".\n\nIn five episodes, John Anderson played Earp's brother, Virgil Earp; in four other episodes, including \"Big Brother Virgil\" and \"The Trail to Tombstone\", Ross Elliott played the part of Virgil. In 15 segments from 1956 to 1961, Ray Boyle, then using the stage name \"Dirk London\", portrayed another brother, Morgan Earp. Between 1958 and 1961, Morgan Woodward, later on CBS's \"Dallas\" in the role of Marvin \"Punk\" Anderson and a frequent guest star on \"Gunsmoke\", as well, played folksy loyal deputy \"Shotgun\" Gibbs in 42 episodes.\n\nDouglas Fowley and Myron Healey were cast 49 and 10 times, respectively, as Earp's close friend John H. \"Doc\" Holliday, whom Earp had met in Texas prior to 1880. Carol Montgomery Stone played Kate Holliday or \"Big Nose Kate\", Holliday's common-law wife, in 10 episodes of the series in the 1957–1958 season. Collette Lyons played Big Kate in two 1958 episodes and \"Rowdy Kate\" in two other segments in 1955 and 1956. At times Holliday seemed affectionate toward Kate; at other time, he seemed oblivious to her existence.\n\nEarlier, on September 25, 1956, Healey played a drunken gunfighter Clay Allison, who comes into Dodge City to confront the Earp legend. In the story line, Pete Albright, a storeowner played by Charles Fredricks, tries to hire Allison to gun down Earp because the marshal is fighting crime in the town and costing merchants business in the process. Allison makes a point of not taking money, but is willing to challenge Earp until he is overcome by his own drunkenness. Mike Ragan played Clay Allison in a 1957 episode, \"The Time for All Good Men\".\n\nMason Alan Dinehart, or Alan Dinehart, III, son of film stars Alan Dinehart and Mozelle Britton, was cast in 34 episodes between 1955 and 1959 as Bat Masterson, a role filled on the NBC series of the same name by the late Gene Barry. Dinehart played Masterson from the ages of 19 to 23.\n\nThe bearded Paul Brinegar in 33 episodes played James H. \"Dog\" Kelley, a veteran of the Union Army, the owner of the Alhambra Saloon, and a city council member and then the mayor while Earp is the deputy marshal in Dodge City. Their paths in history crossed for no more than one year. In the second and third episodes of the second season of the series, set in Dodge City and titled \"Dodge City Gets a New Marshal\" (September 4, 1956) and \"Fight or Run\" (September 11, 1956), Kelley is the hold-out vote on the city council regarding Earp's plan to require gun owners to check in their weapons upon entering town. The Big T Cattle Company, angry with Earp for trying to clean up Dodge City and reduce business from the cowboys, enlists Kelley's help in arranging an ambush of Earp. Kelley is depicted as a reluctant \"good guy\"/\"bad guy\" split personality in many of the episodes in which he appears.\n\nPaul Brinegar subsequently played the cantankerous cooks Wishbone and Jelly Hoskins on the CBS Westerns, \"Rawhide\" and \"Lancer\". In three episodes, Margaret Hayes was cast as Dora Hand, the popular dance-hall actress and singer who had a romantic interest in Mayor Kelley. She is inadvertently shot to death in October 1878 by a rival suitor, James W. \"Spike\" Kenedy, a son of the South Texas rancher baron Mifflin Kenedy. In \"It Had to Happen\" (April 1, 1958), after Masterson is slightly wounded from a gunshot fired by a man whom Earp had struck in the shoulder to avoid killing him, Mayor Kelley orders Earp to \"shoot to kill\" when apprehending lawbreakers. Earp, however, has always used restraint and tried to avoid killing those who would fire upon him. When Earp kills a culprit, he has second thoughts about his role as a lawman.\n\nDon Haggerty was cast in the role of Wichita newspaperman Marsh Murdock in 21 segments of the first season. Trevor Bardette was cast 21 times as the unscrupulous Newman Haynes Clanton, known as Old Man Clanton, when the setting of the series moved to Arizona, but Bardette appeared in earlier episodes, too, under other names. John Milford appeared in eight episodes as the historical Ike Clanton. In seven episodes in 1959 and 1961, Carol Thurston played the fictitious Emma Clanton, daughter of Old Man Clanton and an unlikely romantic interest for Earp. Thurston also was cast in different roles in four earlier episodes before she landed the continuing role as Emma Clanton. James Seay was cast 16 times as Judge Spicer, who became a close friend of Earp's.\n\nWilliam Phipps in 16 episodes played the gunman and rustler Curly Bill Brocius. In the episode \"The Clantons' Family Row\", Brocius is facing a potential gunfight with Johnny Ringo (Peter M. Thompson), who is irate that Brocius accidentally shot and killed Ringo's horse, though he replaced the animal with another. Earp works to stop the gunfight from happening, and Doc Holliday proceeds to take bets on the outcome. In \"Let's Hang Curly Bill\", an older marshal, Fred White (Sam Flint), is mortally wounded when he takes the gun from a drunken Curly Bill, who is celebrating his birthday in a saloon in Tombstone. A town mob demands that Curly Bill be hanged, but Earp places dynamite under the main street to protect his prisoner until the trial. Earp must defend Curly Bill in court because White accidentally caused Curly Bill's gun to discharge; White signed a statement attesting to the facts prior to his death. Doc Holliday noted at the end of the episode that Earp could have merely let Curly Bill hang for past crimes had he not been a just marshal.\n\nSteve Brodie played the dishonest Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan in 9 episodes from 1960 to 1961; Lash La Rue played him in eight other segments, one uncredited. La Rue first appeared in the October 20, 1959 segment, \"You Can't Fight City Hall\" as an agent of territorial Governor John Charles Frémont.\n\nDamian O'Flynn, a Boston native, was cast in a combined 60 episodes, as Judge Tobin in the Dodge City segments and as Dr. Goodfellow, when the setting shifts to Tombstone; in the Wichita episodes, he plays Doc Fabrique. Many episodes show Douglas Fowley as playing the part of Doc Fabrique when he actually is not in the episodes. O'Flynn was left off the credits most of the time. – Correction: Douglas Fowley not Damian O'Flynn played Dr Fabrique, as per the original credits– In \"Frontier Surgeon\" (January 19, 1960), Dr. Goodfellow must obtain a truce with Marshal Earp, who is apprehending a wounded outlaw. The man will die if moved after surgery, but he does not wait the three days to recuperate out of distrust of Earp and the protection of the $15,000 loot his gang and he have taken from Wells Fargo.\n\nWalter Coy appeared twice on \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", as Henry Mason in \"The Doctor\" (1960) and as Ben Thompson in \"Dodge Is Civilized\" (1959). In eight other episodes beginning at the start of the series, Denver Pyle had portrayed Ben Thompson, the gunfighter who was Earp's sometimes rival and reluctant friend, and who later became the marshal in Austin. Pyle was cast as Thompson beginning with the second episode of the series. In \"Bill Thompson Gives In\" (September 20, 1955), Earp uses a pair of Indian scouts, rather than a posse, to help capture Ben Thompson and his brother, Billy Thompson (Hal Baylor), who when inebriated killed the previous Ellsworth sheriff, Chauncey Whitney. The killing was subsequently ruled accidental.\n\nIn \"Marshal Earp Meets General Lee\", Earp uses creativity to defuse a tense situation involving a former Confederate officer and cattle drovers who threaten to tear down Ellsworth. Earp simply declares January 19, 1874, the 67th birthday of General Robert E. Lee, as \"Robert E. Lee Day\" in Ellsworth and pays respect to Lee as a defeated warrior.\n\nBob Steele played Wyatt's deputy, Sam, in four episodes in 1955 during the Wichita period.\n\nThe two actors who portrayed Earp's Cheyenne friends and informers were Rico Alaniz, a native of Mexico, Mr. Cousin in 19 episodes between 1955 and 1959, and Rodd Redwing as Mr. Brother in eight episodes. The role of Mr. Brother ended with the 1958 episode \"One\" because the character is killed by four outlaws called the Dry Gulch Gang. Earp spent several subsequent episodes entitled \"Two\", \"Three\", and \"Four\" apprehending the gang.\n\nIn the show, O'Brian openly carried a Buntline Special, a pistol with a 12-inch barrel, which triggered a mild toy craze at the time the series was originally broadcast. No credible evidence has been found that Wyatt Earp ever owned such a gun. The myth of Earp carrying a Buntline Special was created in Stuart N. Lake's best-selling 1931 biography \"\", later admitted by the author to be highly fictionalized.\n\nThe real Wyatt Earp was appointed as an assistant marshal in Dodge City around May 1876, spent the winter of 1876–77 in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, and rejoined the Dodge City police force as an assistant marshal in spring 1877. He resigned his position in September 1879. Earp is depicted as the town marshal in Tombstone, although his brother Virgil Earp was Deputy U.S. Marshal and Tombstone City Marshal. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to enforce a city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town and to disarm the outlaw cowboys that led to the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Wyatt was only a temporary assistant marshal to his brother.\n\n\"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\" finished number 18 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1956–1957 season, number six in 1957–1958, number 10 in 1958–1959, and number 20 in 1959–1960.\n\nThe series received two Emmy nominations in 1957. Hugh O'Brien was nominated for Best Continuing Performance by an Actor, and Dan Ullman earned a nomination for Best Teleplay Writing - Half Hour or Less.\n\nInfinity Entertainment Group released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1 for the first time on April 21, 2009. This release has been discontinued and is now out of print. On October 28, 2011, Inception Media Group acquired the rights to the series. It subsequently re-released the first season on DVD on December 13, 2011. Season two was released on March 12, 2013.\n\nO'Brian recreated the role of Earp in two episodes of the CBS television series \"Guns of Paradise\" (1990) alongside Gene Barry as Bat Masterson and again in 1991 in \"\", also with Barry as Masterson. An independent movie, \",\" was released in 1994 featuring new footage of O'Brian as Earp mixed with flashbacks consisting of colorized scenes from the original series. The new sequences co-starred Bruce Boxleitner (who had himself played Earp in the telefilm \"I Married Wyatt Earp\"), Paul Brinegar (who later joined the \"Rawhide\" cast), Harry Carey, Jr. (who had, a year earlier, played Marshal Fred White in \"Tombstone\"), and Bo Hopkins.\n\nWith the emergence of television in the 1950s, producers spun out a large number of Western-oriented shows. At the height of their popularity in 1959, more than two dozen \"cowboy\" programs were on weekly. At least five others were connected to some extent with Wyatt Earp: \"Bat Masterson\", \"Tombstone Territory\", \"Broken Arrow\", \"Johnny Ringo\", and \"Gunsmoke\".\n\nEpisodes of \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\" are rebroadcast on the cable television network, Grit. Two episodes of the show are aired daily on Cozi TV.\n\n"}
{"id": "1998798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998798", "title": "Electric bell", "text": "Electric bell\n\nAn electric bell is a mechanical or electronic bell that functions by means of an electromagnet. When an electric current is applied, it produces a repetitive buzzing, clanging or ringing sound. Electric bells have been widely used at railroad crossings, in telephones, fire and burglar alarms, as school bells, doorbells, and alarms in industrial plants, since the late 1800s, but they are now being widely replaced with electronic sounders. An electric bell consists of one or more electromagnets, made of a coil of insulated wire around an iron bar, which attract an iron strip armature with a clapper. When an electric current flows through the coils, the electromagnet creates a magnetic field which pulls the armature towards it, causing the hammer to strike the bell.\n\nThe most widely used form is the interrupter bell, which produces a continuous sound when current is applied. See animation, above. The bell or gong \"(B)\", which is often in the shape of a cup or half-sphere, is struck by a spring-loaded arm \"(A)\" with a metal ball on the end called a clapper, actuated by an electromagnet \"(E)\". In its rest position the clapper is held away from the bell a short distance by its springy arm. When the switch \"(K)\" is closed, an electric current passes from the battery \"(U)\" through the winding of the electromagnet. It creates a magnetic field that attracts the iron arm of the clapper, pulling it over to give the bell a tap. This opens a pair of electrical contacts \"(T)\" attached to the clapper arm, interrupting the current to the electromagnet. The magnetic field of the electromagnet collapses, and the clapper springs away from the bell. This closes the contacts again, allowing the current to flow to the electromagnet again, so the magnet pulls the clapper over to strike the bell again. This cycle repeats rapidly, many times per second, resulting in a continuous ringing.\n\nThe tone of the sound generated depends on the shape and size of the bell or gong resonator. Where several bells are installed together, they may be given distinctive rings by using different size or shapes of gong, even though the strike mechanisms are identical.\n\nAnother type, the single-stroke bell, has no interrupting contacts. The hammer strikes the gong once each time the circuit is closed. These are used to signal brief notifications, such as a shop door opening for a customer, rather than continuous warnings.\n\nAn electric buzzer uses a similar mechanism to an interrupter bell, but without the resonant bell. They are quieter than bells, but adequate for a warning tone over a small distance, such as across a desktop.\n\nA buzzer or beeper is an audio signalling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric. Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.\n\nWith the development of low cost electronics from the 1970s onwards, most buzzers have now been replaced by electronic 'sounders'. These replace the electromechanical striker of a bell with an electronic oscillator and a loudspeaker, often a piezoelectric transducer.\n\nThe first commercial electric bells were used for railway signalling, between signal boxes. Complex bell codes were used to indicate the types of train passing between signal boxes, and the destinations to which they should be routed. \n\nThese were single-stroke bells: applying current to an electromagnet pulled the bell's clapper against the bell or gong and gave one chime. The bell did not ring continuously, but only with a single ring, until current was applied again. To sustain the tone, these bells were usually much larger than are used today with interrupter bells. Bells, gongs and spiral chimes could all be used, giving a distinct tone for each instrument.\n\nA simple development of the single-stroke bell was the sprung bell. This had previously been used, mechanically actuated, for servant-call bells in large houses. Instead of working a clapper, the electromagnet shook the whole bell, which was mounted on a flexible spiral spring. The inertia of the heavy bell on the light spring would continue ringing for some seconds after the stroke. Although the sound would rapidly die away, the visible trembling of the bell could indicate which bell had been rung, amongst a panel of several.\n\nLandline telephone bells were powered by 60 to 105-volt RMS 20-Hertz AC. and a different design, the \"polarised bell\", was used. These have an armature containing a permanent magnet, so that this is alternately attracted and repelled by each half-phase and different polarity of the supply. In practice, the armature is arranged symmetrically with two poles of opposite polarity facing each end of the coil, so that each may be attracted in turn. No contact breaker is required, so such bells are reliable for long service.\n\nFire alarm bells are divided into two categories: vibrating, and single-stroke. On a vibrating bell, the bell will ring continuously until the power is cut off. When power is supplied to a single-stroke bell, the bell will ring once and then stop. It will not ring again until power is turned off and on again. These were frequently used with coded pull stations.\n\nElectric bells are typically designed to operate on low voltages of from 5 to 24 V AC or DC. Before widespread distribution of electric power, bells were necessarily powered by batteries, either wet-cell or dry-cell type. Bells used in early telephone systems derived current by a magneto generator cranked by the subscriber. In residential applications, a small bell-ringing transformer is usually used to power the doorbell circuit. So that bell circuits can be made with low-cost wiring methods, bell signal circuits are limited in voltage and power rating. Bells for industrial purposes may operate on other, higher, AC or DC voltages to match plant voltages or available standby battery systems.\n\nThe interrupter bell evolved from various oscillating electromechanical mechanisms which were devised following the invention of the electromagnet by William Sturgeon in 1823. One of the first was the oscillating electric wire invented by James Marsh in 1824. This consisted of a wire pendulum dipping into a mercury trough, suspended between the poles of an electromagnet. When current was passed through the wire, the force of the magnet made the wire swing sideways, out of the mercury, which broke the current to the magnet, so the wire fell back. The modern electric bell mechanism had its origin in vibrating \"contact breaker\" or \"interrupter\" mechanisms devised to break the primary current in induction coils. Vibrating \"hammer\" interrupters were invented by Johann Philipp Wagner (1839) and Christian Ernst Neeff (1847), and was developed into a buzzer by Froment (1847). John Mirand around 1850 added a clapper and gong to make the standard electric bell for use as a telegraph sounder. Other types were invented around that time by Siemens and Halske and by Lippens. The polarized (permanent magnet) bell used in telephones, which appeared about 1860, had its beginning in the polarized relay and telegraph developed by Werner Siemens around 1850.\n\n"}

In 1952 and 1953 he created his first 8 mm takes of rehearsals by the Berliner Ensemble. In 1953 he moved to West Germany, where he in 1956 began studies in literature and art history, completing them the following year. He earned his doctorate in Munich with his thesis on \"The Absurd in Dürrenmatt.\" In 1963 Syberberg began producing documentary films about Fritz Kortner and Romy Schneider for Bavarian Radio and others.\n\nFor Syberberg, cinema is a form of \"Gesamtkunstwerk\". Many commentators, including Syberberg himself, have characterized his work as a cinematic combination of Bertolt Brecht's doctrine of epic theatre and Richard Wagner's operatic aesthetics. Well known philosophers and intellectuals have written about his work, including Susan Sontag, Gilles Deleuze and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe.\n\nIn 1975 Syberberg released \"Winifried Wagner und die Geschichte des Hauses Wahnfried von 1914-1975\" (English title: \"The Confessions of Winifred Wagner\"), a documentary about Winifred Wagner, an Englishwoman who had married Richard Wagner's son Siegfried. The documentary attracted attention because it exposed Mrs Wagner's unrepentant admiration for Adolf Hitler. The film thus proved an embarrassment to the Wagner family and the Bayreuth Festival (which she had run from 1930 until the end of the Second World War). Winifred Wagner objected to the inclusion in the film of conversations she did not know were being recorded. \n\nSyberberg is also noted for an acclaimed visual interpretation of the Wagner opera \"Parsifal\" in 1982.\n\nSyberberg's work has attracted criticism at least since the publication of the film script of \"Hitler: A Film from Germany\", particularly from the Left, who were amongst many targets of his criticism in that book. In later essays, although he never presented himself as a conservative or sympathizer with German nationalism, his comments began to scandalize a broad spectrum of writers and critics in Germany and elsewhere. Even Susan Sontag, who had written the introduction to the English translation of the book version of \"Hitler: A Film from Germany\", was reportedly shocked by some of his later statements, though she claimed that her feelings about his films were unaffected.\n\nIn one notorious example Syberberg wrote in \"Vom Unglück und Glück der Kunst in Deutschland nach dem letzten Kriege\" (On the Misfortune and Fortune of Art in Germany after the Last War, 1990):\n\n\"Whoever joined the Jews and the leftists was successful, and it did not necessarily have anything to do with love, or understanding, or even inclination. How could Jews tolerate that, being that these others only wanted power.\"\n\nIan Buruma, in the \"New York Review of Books\", quotes several of Syberberg's controversial statements. Syberberg described modern German art as \"filthy and sick... in praise of cowardice and treason, of criminals, whores, of hate, ugliness, of lies and crimes and all that is unnatural.\" He also wrote that:\n\n\"The Jewish interpretation of the world followed upon the Christian, just as the Christian one followed Roman and Greek culture. So now Jewish analyses, images, definitions of art, science, sociology, literature, politics, the information media, dominate. Marx and Freud are the pillars that mark the road from East to West. Neither are imaginable without Jewishness. Their systems are defined by it. The axis USA-Israel guarantees the parameters. That is the way people think now, the way they feel, act and disseminate information. We live in the Jewish epoch of European cultural history. And we can only wait, at the pinnacle of our technological power, for our last judgment at the edge of the apocalypse…. So that's the way it looks, for all of us, suffocating in unprecedented technological prosperity, without spirit, without meaning... Those who want to have good careers go along with Jews and leftists [and] the race of superior men [\"Rasse der Herrenmenschen\"] has been seduced, the land of poets and thinkers has become the fat booty of corruption, of business, of lazy comfort.\"\n\nBuruma writes:\n\"It is not for his aesthetics, however, that Syberberg has been attacked, but for his politics. The strongest criticism of his book was published in \"Der Spiegel\", the liberal weekly magazine. Syberberg's views, wrote the critic, were precisely those that led to the book burning in 1933, and prepared the way for the Final Solution of 1942. In fact, he went on, they are worse, for \"now we know that they are caked with blood…. They are not just abstruse nonsense, they are criminal.\" The \"Spiegel\" critic compared Syberberg to the young Hitler, the failed art student in Vienna, who rationalized his failure by blaming it on a conspiracy of left-wing Jews. Syberberg feels he is an unappreciated genius, and he too blames it on the same forces.\n\n\"Frank Schirrmacher, the young literary editor of the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", and the scourge of woolly thinkers of all political persuasions, is equally opposed to Syberberg and draws similar parallels with the Twenties and Thirties. And like the critic in \"Der Spiegel\", he singles out for special censure an interview with \"Die Zeit\" in which Syberberg claimed that he 'could understand' the feeling of the SS man on the railway ramp of Auschwitz, who, in Himmler's words, 'made himself hard' for the sake of fulfilling his mission to the end. He did not admire this feeling, but he could understand it. Just as he could understand its opposite, the rejection of principles to act humanely.\"\n\nSyberberg currently resides mainly on his family estate in Nossendorf which he has bought back and restored, but has a secondary residence in Munich.\n\n\n\nSyberberg is featured at length in the film \"The Ister\" (2004).\n\n\n\n"}

R. Arulpragasam) was a Tamil activist and former revolutionary from Jaffna who had a part in forming the group Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS) in January 1975 in Wandsworth, England during the Tamil independence movements to secure an independent Tamil Eelam. He later left the conflict, after work as an independent peace negotiator between the two sides of the civil war. At the time of his death, he headed the Global Sustainability Initiative in the United Kingdom. He was also the father of the musician M.I.A. \nand the jewellery designer Kali Arulpragasam.\n\nArulpragasam graduated from the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in Moscow with a degree in Engineering.\n\nHaving created EROS in 1975 in Wandsworth, England the group staged demonstrations at the inaugural Cricket World Cup that year, prompting clashes between Tamil and Sinhalese cricket supporters, and bringing the conflict in Sri Lanka to international attention for the first time. In March 1976, he moved to Vavuniya and was one of three EROS members selected to train for six months in Lebanon with Palestinian militants associated with the Fatah wing of the PLO. He left after three months of training, returning to Jaffna, Northern Sri Lanka with his family. Arulpragasam moved back to Vavuniya in late 1976 and from 1978 – 1986, he lived and worked in Tamil Nadu where India, through its intelligence agency supported and trained EROS, one of six Tamil revolutionary groups against the Sri Lankan state. He made sporadic visits to Jaffna where his family lived, introducing himself to his children as their uncle. Although never himself a member of the LTTE, Arulpragasam was an old friend of the group's military leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran during the early years of the Tamil rebellion. His wife and three children left Jaffna in the late 80s and were granted political asylum in the United Kingdom, while he remained behind. Arul Pragasam left his group EROS and the conflict in 1987, becoming an independent peace mediator between the two sides of the civil war, and he was instrumental in bringing in more direct Indian intervention to the conflict in 1987, ultimately ending in failure.\n\nM.I.A. has stated in interviews her father shared revolutionary ideals, and that he was a politician, although she had no contact with him since the early 1990s. Rarely speaking about her father publicly, in an interview with \"The Guardian\" in 2005, M.I.A. stated \"He never had a practical, physical influence\" in her family's life. On his involvement in the war and some writers referring to him as a former Tiger rebel, she has said \"People write it because it's easy. The Tigers were big in numbers but my dad was too selective. The Tigers had machetes and said, 'They killed my mum so I'm going to fucking fight them.' And my dad was like, 'No no no no, read this amazing book about revolution. Let's sit down and draw up a manifesto.\"\n\nIn 1997, he set up an Institute of Sustainability Development at Trincomalee on the Eastern Province's coast. The same year, he wrote a seminal book on Tamil history, and was based in the island's north east and Tamil Nadu until the mid-2000s. He contacted his daughter following the release of her debut album, named \"Arular\" after him, in 2005, telling her to change its name, however she refused. His house was flooded after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Arulpragasam moved to Britain and, at the time of his death, headed the Britain-based Global Sustainability Initiative, which has overseen inventions such as a redesigned bullock cart, a motorised wheelbarrow and a car that consumes less petrol. Arulpragasam explained \"GSI's mission is to develop a program with a global perspective.\" Pragasam died on December 3, 2019, aged 71.\n\nArul Pragasam was the father of jewellery designer Kali Arulpragasam, musician/filmmaker/visual artist Mathangi \"Maya\" Arulpragasam (better known by her stage name, M.I.A.), and Sugu Arulpragasam. His family moved back to Sri Lanka when Maya was six months old. M.I.A. named her 2005 debut album \"Arular\" after her father, partly for him to get in contact with her. \"Arular\" was his nom de guerre during the civil war. M.I.A. said of her upbringing: \"I only had my mum. I never grew up with my dad so I don’t know what he’s like. I think I’m a mixture of both. My mum’s really passive, quiet and she’s not feisty. She cared about bringing in food and getting us to school and stuff but that’s as far as it went. Growing up without a dad, I was going to school and turning up at parents' meetings on my own. At the time everyone was like, \"Oh if you had a dad he’d pay for your school and you’d have a better future\". At the time, my mom was bringing us up and she was like, \"The only thing your father gave you was a name\". So that's why I used [his name \"Arular\"] on my album to turn it into a statement that my mom always made. If the only thing he's going to give me is a name, then that's what I'm going to use.\" In 2005, M.I.A. told EGO Magazine that despite her father's involvement in the conflict, she felt no affiliation to either armed party in the war, noting her work to be the voice of \"civilians and refugees that get caught up in the cross fire of politics\" and shocking enough to invoke discussion in young people that felt they had no right to talk. Following the end of the armed conflict in 2009, M.I.A. condemned the Government of Sri Lanka for engaging in systematic genocide against Tamils. In a 2010 feature for \"The Fader\", she stated of the US and Sri Lankan government's behaviour towards her following her rise in prominence: \"He negotiated peace processes, brought in the new army, and when he goes to Sri Lanka, it’s the government who gives him security against the Tigers\", she explains. \"They used it the other way and told the world my dad’s a Tiger which got me to this point. It’s like, 'Wow I didn’t know this guy, and this guy has been working for you for 20 fucking years, and when you feel like it you want to use my own dad against me to discredit what I do.'\"\n\nArulpragasam, Maya (2002). \"M.I.A.

She was the only daughter of Hilton Hotel founder Conrad Hilton with his second wife, actress and socialite Zsa Zsa Gabor.\n\nFrancesca Hilton was born in 1947 in New York City, after her parents were granted a divorce in September, 1946. Her father, Conrad Nicholson Hilton, was the founder of the Hilton Hotel chain. Her mother, Zsa Zsa Gabor, was a Hungarian-born actress and socialite. Gabor's 1991 autobiography \"One Lifetime Is Not Enough\", alleged that her pregnancy was a result of rape by then-husband Conrad Hilton.\n\nShe was the only child of Zsa Zsa Gabor and therefore the only descendant of the Gabor sisters as well as the only daughter of Conrad Hilton. Her three half-brothers were Conrad Nicholson Hilton Jr. (1926–1969); William Barron Hilton (1927–2019); and Eric Michael Hilton (1933–2016). She attended movie premieres with her mother and competed in equestrian competitions as a child.\n\nIn 1947, while Hilton was an infant, a burglar entered their home and tied up Zsa Zsa Gabor and their housekeeper, and threatened to kill Francesca. The burglar stole jewelry worth over $750,000.\n\nShe worked in reservations at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California during summers as a teenager. When her father died in 1979, he left most of his wealth to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. She contested the will, which left her only $100,000, but lost the suit. In October 1993, she married Joseph Piche. The couple divorced in 2010 and had no children. At the time of her death, she was engaged to Michael Natsis. She resided in Los Angeles most of her life.\n\nOn June 1, 2005, her stepfather, Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, filed suit against her in a California court and accused her of fraud. The court threw out the case for lack of evidence. Hilton denied the allegations. Hilton lived in West Hollywood apartments for the last nine years of her life. After her mother Zsa Zsa Gabor became incapacitated (including loss of voice, hearing, and eyesight, as well as total dementia) and left to the care of her stepfather, Francesca was totally cut off financially by him.\n\nShe starred in \"A Safe Place\" in 1971 and \"The Gravy Train\" in 1974. She worked as a photographer in the 1980s. She also worked for the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.\n\nIn 2008, she started performing as a comedian on a regular basis at The Comedy Store in West Hollywood. Her show centered on her family. She joked that her great-nieces, Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton, were \"pole dancers and porn stars.\"\n\nAccording to her publicist, Edward Lozzi, she was writing an autobiography shortly before she died in 2015.\n\nAt the time of her death, Hilton had been homeless and living out of her car for some time. Francesca Hilton died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on January 5, 2015, after suffering a major stroke. She was just over two months short of her 68th birthday. Her stepfather's fight to take possession of her body was rejected by the Los Angeles coroner, and so her body remained in a morgue until her half-brother Barron Hilton was given her body. Her family and Francesca's close friends arranged her funeral. Her then close-to-98-years-old mother, Zsa Zsa Gabor, suffering from dementia, was unaware of her daughter's death and was never informed before her own death in December 2016.\n\nFrancesca Hilton's funeral was held at St Ambrose Catholic Church, West Hollywood. She was cremated. Her ashes were interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery close to her aunt Eva Gabor.\n"}

{"id": "1998877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998877", "title": "Boeing 367-80", "text": "Boeing 367-80\n\nThe Boeing 367-80, known simply as the Dash 80, is an American quadjet prototype aircraft built by Boeing to demonstrate the advantages of jet propulsion for commercial aviation. It served as basis for the design of the KC-135 tanker and the 707 airliner.\n\nThe Dash 80 first flew in 1954, less than two years from project launch. Its US$16 million cost (equivalent to $ million today) was an enormous risk for Boeing, which at the time had no committed customers. Only one example was built, which has been preserved and is currently on public display at the Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia.\n\nBy the late 1940s two developments encouraged Boeing to begin considering building a passenger jet. The first was the maiden flight in 1947 of the B-47 Stratojet. The second was the maiden flight in 1949 of the world's first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet. Boeing President Bill Allen led a company delegation to the UK in summer 1950, where they saw the Comet fly at the Farnborough Airshow, and also visited the de Havilland factory at Hatfield, Hertfordshire where the Comets were being built. Boeing felt it had mastered the swept wing and podded engines which it saw as key technologies that would enable it to improve on the Comet.\n\nIn 1950 Boeing tentatively produced a specification for a jet airliner dubbed the \"Model 473-60C\". The airlines were unconvinced because they had no experience with jet transports and were enjoying success with piston engined aircraft such as the Douglas DC-4, DC-6, Boeing Stratocruiser and Lockheed Constellation.\n\nBoeing was experienced at selling to the military but had not enjoyed the same success with civil airliners. This market was dominated by Douglas which was adept at meeting the needs of airlines by refining and developing its range of propeller-driven aircraft, and in 1950 was marketing the forthcoming DC-7. Boeing decided the only way to overcome the airlines' suspicion of the jet – and of itself – was to show them a completed aircraft.\n\nAs the first of a new generation of passenger jets, Boeing wanted the aircraft's model number to emphasize the difference from its previous propeller-driven aircraft which bore 300-series numbers. The 400-, 500- and 600-series were already used by missiles and other products, so Boeing decided that the jets would bear 700-series numbers, and the first would be the 707.\nBoeing had studied developments of its existing Model 367 (the KC-97 Stratofreighter) incorporating swept wings and podded engines; and chose to build the , which retained little of the KC-97 except the upper fuselage diameter (and the possibility of building some of the fuselage with existing tooling). Although the design was announced publicly as the Model 707, the prototype was referred to within Boeing simply as the Dash 80 or \"-80\".\n\nThe Dash 80 fuselage was wide enough at for five-abreast seating; two on one side of the aisle and three on the other. The fuselage diameter for the production KC-135 was widened to and Boeing originally hoped to build the 707 fuselage with that width. By the time the Boeing company committed to production, the decision had been made to design the production model 707 as a six-abreast design, with a larger fuselage, after C. R. Smith, CEO of American Airlines, told Boeing he wouldn't buy the 707 unless it was an inch wider than the then-proposed Douglas DC-8 passenger jet. This decision did not unduly delay the introduction of the production model since the -80 had been largely hand-built, using little production tooling.\n\nBy early 1952 the designs were complete and in April the Boeing board approved the program. Construction of the Dash 80 started in November in a walled-off section of Boeing's Renton plant. As a proof of concept prototype there was no certification and no production line and most of the parts were custom built. The aircraft was not fitted with an airline cabin; a plywood lining housed the instrumentation for the flight test program.\n\nThe Dash 80 rolled out of the factory on May 15, 1954, two years after the project was approved and 18 months after construction had started. During a series of taxi trials the port landing gear collapsed on May 22; the damage was quickly repaired and the first flight was on July 15, 1954.\n\nFollowing flights revealed a propensity to \"Dutch roll\" - an alternating yawing and rolling motion. Boeing already had experience with this on the B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress and had developed a yaw damper system on the B-47 that could be adapted to the Dash 80. Other problems were found with the engines and brakes, the latter once failing completely on landing causing the aircraft to overshoot the runway.\n\nBoeing used the Dash 80 on demonstration flights for airline executives and other industry figures. These focused attention on the question of what the cabin of a passenger jet should look like. In a departure from its usual practice Boeing hired industrial design firm Walter Dorwin Teague to create a cabin as radical as the aircraft itself.\n\nPrior to demonstration for passenger airlines, the Dash 80 was fitted with Boeing's Flying Boom for aerial refueling which served as a prototype for the KC-135 Stratotanker and its later derivatives.\n\nAs part of the Dash 80's demonstration program, Bill Allen invited representatives of the Aircraft Industries Association (AIA) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) to the Seattle's 1955 Seafair and Gold Cup Hydroplane Races held on Lake Washington on August 6, 1955. The Dash 80 was scheduled to perform a simple flyover, but Boeing test pilot Alvin \"Tex\" Johnston instead performed two barrel rolls to show off the jet airliner.\n\nThe next day, Allen summoned Johnston to his office and told him not to perform such a maneuver again, to which Johnston replied that he was simply \"selling airplanes\" and asserted that doing so was completely safe.\n\nBoeing Chief Test Pilot John Cashman stated that just before he piloted the maiden flight of the Boeing 777 on June 12, 1994, his last instructions from then-Boeing President Phil Condit were \"No rolls.\"\n\nAfter the arrival of the first production 707 in 1957 the Dash 80 was adapted into a general experimental aircraft and used by Boeing to test a variety of new technologies and systems. One of its most important tasks during the late 1950s was to test systems for the new Boeing 727, including the fitting of a fifth engine in the rear fuselage. Other tests included experiments with different airfoil shapes and a number of high lift devices such as blown flaps, in which compressed air bled from the engines is directed over the flaps to increase lift during takeoff and landing.\n\nAfter 2,350 hours and 1,691 flights the aircraft was withdrawn from use in 1969 and placed in storage. On May 26, 1972 Boeing donated the to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, which had designated it one of the 12 most significant aircraft of all time. For the next 18 years the aircraft was stored at a \"desert boneyard\" now called the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona before being retrieved by Boeing in 1990 for restoration. The Dash 80's final flight was to Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. on August 27, 2003. Repainted to its original yellow and brown Boeing livery, it was put on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, located adjacent to Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded by Harry J. Batt Sr. (grandfather of American actor Bryan Batt) and later managed and owned by his sons, Harry J. Batt Jr. and John A. Batt. It opened on Saturday, June 30, 1928, across Bayou St. John from an existing amusement resort at Old Spanish Fort. Pontchartrain Beach's original location is the present-day lakefront neighborhood of Lake Terrace.\n\nIn the early 1930s, subsequent to the construction of a seawall extending from West End to the Industrial Canal which created a new shoreline for Lake Pontchartrain, Pontchartrain Beach was moved to a new location at the lake end of Elysian Fields Avenue, a location formerly offshore of Milneburg.\n\nPontchartrain Beach included a beach with a large art deco style bathhouse and swimming pools, amusement rides (including a wooden roller coaster called the Zephyr), and concession stands. The park featured live music concerts, including many local musicians and touring national acts such as Elvis Presley.\n\nOther rides and amusements included the Zephyr Junior, Smoky Mary, the Wild Maus, Musik Express, Log Ride, the Ragin' Cajun (a modern, looping steel coaster), the Bug, Paratrooper, Scrambler, Calypso, the \"airplanes\", Haunted House, Ghost Train, bumper cars, carousel, Ferris wheel, the Monster, Trabant, Sky Ride, Hard Rock, Galaxy, Laff in the Dark, Magic Rainbow, Red Baron, and Kiddieland. As with other amusement or theme parks, over time certain older rides were changed out for new ones.\n\nIn addition to rides, there were also the summertime shows which changed every few years (Skipper & Dolly dolphin show, Great American High Dive Show, Merlin's Magic Rainbow Show). For a few years there was also a fairly large petting zoo with many farm animals and a huge red barn house. A miniature golf course was added, when this pastime became popular. Just outside the entrance gates was the Bali Hai Tiki-style restaurant. Another popular restaurant was the Ship Ahoy, which featured hamburgers and seafood.\n\nPontchartrain Beach was sold on September 23, 1983. The main reason it closed down was due to declining attendance.\n\nIn 1943, Corporal Douglas O'Brien, a World War II serviceman from Springfield, Massachusetts, fell to his death from the top of the Zephyr roller coaster. He was 28 years old.\n\nSeveral of the rides – including the Airplanes and many Kiddieland rides – ended up in Gulf Shores, Alabama, at a small amusement park, which was subsequently wiped out by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. The Ragin' Cajun moved to the Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom in 1984 and opened as Steamin' Demon. One of the four antique carousels is located on the boardwalk in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Also, the crest of the Zephyr currently resides at Kenner Memorial Park, among with remnants of Bali Hai restaurant.\n\nThe hand-painted carousel horses were donated by Harry J. Batt Jr. and John A. Batt to New Orleans' City Park. The Park did not acknowledge the gifts or recognize the Batts for their donation.\n\nThe land formerly housing the park is now occupied by the University of New Orleans Research & Technology Park, home to the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) and the UNO Advanced Technology Center office building.\n\nA mile-long sand beach is still at the same area where Pontchartrain Beach once was. It is inaccessible and off limits to the general public, having been deemed hazardous due to underwater drop offs and riprap which pose dangers for swimmers.\n\nWater quality had increased dramatically in recent decades and the sand beach was reopened at one point, until a pair of drownings occurred and the beach was re-closed. The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation has undertaken the task of restoring Pontchartrain Beach for use as a public recreation area. While no opening date has been given officially, a phased approach was expected to begin in the summer of 2016.\n\n\n"}

She was originally a secretary at Amcam corporation, where she fell in love with James MacDonald Hudson. After he had stolen his power suit to prevent it from being used as a military weapon, Heather discovered his secret and decided to share it with him. Soon after they were married.\n\nHeather supported her husband in the forming of Department H and his becoming a superhero. She also assisted Wolverine in a time of trouble before his career with the X-Men, and was later reunited with him.\n\nAfter Department H is dissolved, Heather brought the members of the disbanded Alpha Flight together to battle Tundra of the Great Beasts. With this initiative creating a spectacular success, the team decided to continue operating Alpha Flight as an independent group. Before Alpha Flight had been back together for long, Heather witnessed the apparent death of James Hudson. She was then injured attempting to rescue a child from an alien Plodex.\n\nHeather is asked by the members of Alpha Flight to take over leadership of the team when her husband James, the leader of Alpha Flight, is apparently killed. She accepts, though initially she leads purely as a non-combatant. She led Alpha Flight on a mission with the X-Men, and was temporarily transformed by the mystic Fire Fountain. This transforms her into a state Loki refers to as a 'demi-god'. She has increased leadership abilities along with vague powers that put her above all other humans. She rejects these powers when all involved learn it would come at the cost of humanity's creativity and the lives of anyone magical, such as her two friends Shaman and Snowbird. She was briefly \"reunited\" with what she thought was James Hudson, but who really turned out to be an impostor – the robot Delphine Courtney. Her body was temporarily distorted by Scramble, and then she was captured by Deadly Ernest.\n\nEventually, these dangerous encounters led to Heather adopting a copy of her husband's battle-suit. Through extensive training by Wolverine, Heather is able to hold her own in a battle. Heather teamed with Wolverine against Lady Deathstrike, and took the name Vindicator. She became stranded in the Savage Land, and formed the mutated natives into a team called Alpha Prime. Some time later, Heather was forced to defend Alpha Flight in a Parliamentary hearing.\n\nEventually her husband returns and her suit is altered to manipulate geothermal forces and she takes the name Guardian. Soon after that, she battled the Fantastic Four.\n\nHeather and James have a baby (an as-yet-unnamed girl) and travel with their child and several other members of Alpha Flight to return a clutch of Plodex eggs to their homeworld. In addition, an accident brings temporal copies of most of the original Alpha Flight – from a time before her husband's \"death\" – to the present. This group includes a copy of Heather. While she is not a member, this \"new\" group is active as Alpha Flight while the originals are helping to rebuild the Plodex homeworld.\n\nAlpha Flight (the team consisting of Sasquatch, Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, Major Mapleleaf II, and both Pucks) are brutally attacked by a new villain \"the Collective\". They are killed and their bodies are left in the Yukon Territory as the Collective continues on to the United States.\n\nDuring the \"Chaos War\" storyline, Vindicator (alongside Guardian, Shaman, and Marrina Smallwood) are among the heroes that return from the dead after what happened to the death realms. Reuniting with Aurora, Northstar, Sasquatch, and Snowbird, Alpha Flight gets back together to fight the Great Beasts.\n\nDuring the \"Fear Itself\" storyline, Vindicator helped Alpha Flight in fighting Attuma in the form of Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans. When Alpha Flight returns to their headquarters, they are betrayed by Gary Cody and his newly elected Unity Party. Vindicator sides with Cody. It is shown that six weeks earlier, Guardian and Vindicator were unable to regain custody of their child. While bringing Guardian to the Box Units for imprisonment, Vindicator is ambushed by Puck who knocks Vindicator out. After reclaiming her daughter Claire from her cousin, Vindicator assembles Alpha Strike (consisting of Persuasion, Ranark, a Wendigo, and a brainwashed Citadel) in order to spread the Unity program and take down Alpha Flight. It is later revealed that Vindicator and Department H had actually fallen under the mental control of Master of the World. While at a beach in Ontario with Claire, Vindicator is visited by Wolverine who states that the people in the United States are starting to be concerned about the Unity Party's actions, and when he saw Vindicator call the rest of Alpha Flight traitors Wolverine decided to investigate. Vindicator then accompanies Alpha Strike into attacking Alpha Flight, Taskmaster, and Wolverine. Vindicator fights Guardian, who tries to get through to Vindicator by stating that Master of the World is controlling her. At the end of the \"Alpha Flight\" series, Vindicator (still under the influence of the Master) helped Alpha Flight against Alpha Strike and then Master of the World attempts to kill their child Claire. He was killed by Alpha Flight but Vindicator escapes with Claire. After the Unity Party is abolished, Vindicator with her daughter Claire leaves Canada.\n\nFormerly, Vindicator wore the Guardian suit that her husband currently wears. Currently Heather's suit, which she first employed in \"Alpha Flight\" vol. 2, taps into a different source for its power. Instead of manipulating electromagnetic energies, this suit allows its wearer to control geothermal energy, allowing Heather to melt rock and manipulate the resulting lava, create jets of lava, create both hot and cold jets of water, including jets of steam and cooling sprays of water. The suit can absorb heat into its power cells, provides its wearer with a personal force field, and enables feats of super-strength and super-speed.\n\nHeather is a master combat strategist, and received combat training in hand-to-hand combat from Puck and Wolverine.\n\nA black Canadian version of Heather Hudson, who served as her Alpha Flight's version of Sasquatch, was a member of the Exiles, recruited against her will to replace a brain-damaged Thunderbird by the Timebroker. A brilliant scientist and physician, she became Sasquatch after being accidentally exposed to gamma rays. She was recruited to Alpha Flight as the team’s muscle and medic, and shortly afterwards met Wolverine when he was found wandering the wilderness after escaping from the Weapon X facility. Heather successfully restored Wolverine to sanity, and the two fell in love and married. Two years later, Weapon X activated a hidden trigger in Wolverine’s mind, forcing Heather to kill him when he went on a rampage. After years of mourning, she remarried Alpha Flight commander James Hudson, who had comforted her in her grief.\n\nHeather Hudson also appears as the non-powered wife of James Hudson, who she was introduced to by Wolverine, and is adoptive mother of Wolverine's son James Hudson Jr.\n\n\n\n"}

The 2010 DePuy Hip Recall was issued after research released by the National Joint Registry (NJR) found high rates of hip replacement failure for the ASR XL Acetabular and ASR Hip Resurfacing systems. Another study noted the high rate of failure in patients who received ASR XL hip arthroplasty. In August 2013, attorneys for thousands of patients who received the implants sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration accusing the company of breaking federal law by hiding experts’ misgivings about the device, and called on the agency to investigate. “We believe almost all of these injuries would have been avoided had DePuy complied with the reporting requirements and informed your agency about the adverse events and concerns about the safety of the ASR which came to the company’s attention,” the attorneys said. DePuy faces more than 11,000 plaintiffs nationwide over the ASR XL, which generally allege that the product is prone to degrading prematurely and shedding toxic metal debris, causing pain and necessitating revision surgeries that can be more invasive than the initial total hip replacements. In the first trial related to the product, a California jury awarded $8.3 million in compensatory damages to a retired prison guard, finding the implant's design to be faulty and DePuy to have acted negligently. A judge later upheld the jury verdict on post-trial motions. In the second trial, an Illinois jury returned a verdict in favor of DePuy in a lawsuit brought by a nurse who had sought $5 million in damages.\n\nOn June 14, 2012, Johnson and Johnson completed the acquisition of Synthes, which was integrated with the DePuy franchise to establish the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson.

Although she apparently killed Deadly Ernest, he did return. There, the Flight member Puck used Nemesis's sword to fatally wound her father, who was then knocked in front of an oncoming subway train and apparently killed. Nemesis then explained to the heroes her relation to the villain and disintegrated.\n\nThe second Nemesis, Jane Thorne, first appeared in \"Alpha Flight\", vol. 1 #76 and was created by writer James Hudnall.\n\nJane Thorne wore a costume identical to the first Nemesis, and used the original's sword and, on occasion, had used a teleportation device. Nothing about her past has been revealed, save that she once led a cult called the \"Children of the Night\".\n\nThe second Nemesis was introduced as a member of Canada's new government sanctioned team, Gamma Flight, and remained a member until the team was disbanded, at which point she fled to keep her teammate Wild Child from being placed in government custody. After Alpha Flight was reinstated, Wild Child, now a full member of Alpha Flight, rescued her from Rok, the new leader of the Children of the Night. She accompanied him to the Alpha Flight headquarters and became a member of Alpha Flight.\n\nThe third Nemesis to be introduced was born in the early 19th Century under the name Amelia Weatherly. She became the mistress of Centennial. She was killed under unknown circumstances involving a building burning down and was buried in a shallow grave. Although Centennial never found her body, he had a proper funeral for \"the one thing he ever loved\".\n\nSomehow, after having \"been to Hell – twice\" she was revived as \"the living embodiment of retribution\", her dead body animated by the connection to her Promethium soulsword, Scell. When the sword is not held by her or sheathed close to her body, she can barely move.\n\nLater, she was arrested by the Canadian Government as an anarchist terrorist and held until Sasquatch made a bargain for her release to join his new Alpha Flight lineup to save the originals – initially under coercion, with Sasquatch injecting her with nanotechnology capable of severing her connection to her sword, effectively killing her, if she attempted to kill any Alpha Flight member. While only Nemesis herself was aware of their connection, Centennial was also independently recruited by Sasquatch to the team.\n\nAfter they helped to rescue the original team, Nemesis herself was the member keenest for the new team to remain assembled, since, while long-lived, she was not immortal and her life was coming to an end – although, visibly, she had not aged since her original death – and there was a matter she needed to attend to, which she couldn't do from prison. She eventually convinced Sasquatch to allow her freedom in return for remaining a member.\n\nWhen Flashback then came to ask for help in preventing himself from being drawn back to his death in the past, Nemesis revealed she and her sword could time-travel – however, she didn't mention until after she'd done it that she would need to kill Flashback to do so. She justified it on the grounds that if they prevented the original problem – which Sasquatch identified as Guardian's original death – then she would never have needed to kill Flashback in the first place. She then proceeded to kill the members of Alpha Flight one-by-one, as their attempts to solve the problem made the present increasingly worse and required someone else to go back to alter the past further. When she stabbed them, they went to a \"weigh station\" inside herself where they would exit in the past with no memory of the time spent there.\n\nWhen it was Centennial's turn to be stabbed and enter the station, she revealed herself to him at last as the mistress he'd truly loved, but said she couldn't tell him after she exited to reality, and after she sent everyone else (bar Sasquatch) back, she spent time cradling his dead body. When the time finally came to kill herself, she met herself in the final moments of her original life, suffering a \"slow and painful death\" in a shallow grave at the foot of a hill, topped with a flaming building, and briefly comforted herself.\n\nWhen she arrived in the past, she killed Heather Hudson to prevent Guardian's death, which meant that the future Sasquatch became one where Guardian had spent ten years becoming the ruler of the world – and torturing Nemesis. Sasquatch, however, managed to persuade Shaman to reset the timeline so that the attempts at altering the past had never happened. The result was that Flashback came, not to prevent his own death, but to give Sasquatch Shaman's pouch, which yielded copies of the original Alpha Flight taken from shortly before Guardian's \"death,\" with only Shaman and Nemesis herself remembering the erased timeline, whereupon Shaman convinced Nemesis to reveal herself to Centennial, so that when they died shortly after they were buried together.\n\nWhen stunned, she starts talking about \"fuzzy bunnies\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1998949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998949", "title": "League of Assassins", "text": "League of Assassins\n\nLeague of Assassins (renamed the League of Shadows or Society of Shadows in adapted works) is a group of fictional villains appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. The group is depicted as a collective of assassins who work for Ra's al Ghul, an enemy of the superhero Batman and the Green Arrow. The group first appeared in \"Strange Adventures\" #215 (Dec 1968).\n\nThe League of Assassins has been adapted into other media several times, predominantly in animated \"Batman\" productions, the live-action Batman film series \"The Dark Knight Trilogy\", as well as the CW TV show \"Arrow\", and the Fox TV show \"Gotham\".\n\nyasser split from the ancient \"Order of the Assassins\" in a successor movement. Their followers claim to have annulled and deposed centers of civilizations such as Baghdad, Moscow, and Rome, throughout past generations in their lineage.\n\nThe recruits of the League of Assassins follow a strict regimen, carrying distinct black emblems and supplies up to their mountain lairs.\n\nThese new recruits are called \"Ghuls\", because they emerge after proclaiming their final prayers in their own prefabricated graves before initiating in various, assigned operations.\n\nUnlike the ancient Order of the Assassins, whose main objective was to halt sectarian conflicts and wars within the world; the \"League of Assassins\" acts as an organization that is a catalyst to the reformation of decadent civilizations around the globe.\n\nThe League of Assassins was founded by Ra's al Ghul (exactly when is unknown) to be \"the fang that protects the head\" (\"Batgirl\" #67, 2005). Members of the League demonstrated willingness to die at a word from Ra's. They have included some of the most dangerous assassins in the world including Lady Shiva, David Cain, and Merlyn. For much of its current history, any member who failed in an assassination was in turn targeted by the League. Indeed, one of its best-known members, the master-archer Merlyn, was eventually forced to flee from the League, fearing for his life, having failed to assassinate Batman. In more recent years, this policy has apparently relaxed somewhat.\n\nEbeneezer Darcel, aka Doctor Darhk, was the first known individual assigned to head the League of Assassins by Ra's al Ghul. Darhk himself was seconded by the Sensei, a martial arts master from Hong Kong. Although many of the League's leaders over the years have been accomplished martial artists, Darhk himself did not depend on physical prowess, and as an assassin he instead relied upon careful planning and manipulation, ambushes and death traps, as well as a variety of cleverly concealed weapons and poisons. Although the League apparently had an inner circle of elite fighters as well as a large number of warriors trained in the martial arts, the League during Darhk's tenure as leader reflected his personal methodology. Following a \"falling out\" with Ra's (the exact details of which were never made clear) Darhk kidnapped Ra's daughter, Talia al Ghul. Batman became involved in this matter while attempting to bring the League to justice for a number of recent killings. Although he had connected the League to several assassinations over the years, all previous attempts to investigate had met dead-ends. Batman rescued Talia (the first time the two would meet, laying the foundation for all their future interaction) and Darhk died while trying to kill them.\n\nUnder the direction of the organization's second known leader, the villainous Sensei, the League became more brutal, and rebelled against Ra's' rule. Although the Sensei's methods closely resembled Darrk's, and the majority of the League's operatives showed little to no real skill in personal combat, the Sensei did show slightly more reliance on skilled martial artists. This version of the League is best known for two assassinations. As part of an initiation process, the operative known as 'the Hook was assigned to murder Boston Brand (who became Deadman after his death). Additionally, Professor Ojo successfully brainwashed Ben Turner (best friend and partner of Richard Dragon), creating an alternate personality dubbed the Bronze Tiger, and turning the master martial artist into a League operative. As the Bronze Tiger, Turner defeated Batman in personal combat while another League operative murdered Kathy Kane (the secret identity of Batwoman in pre-Crisis continuity, and a close personal friend of Batman's post-crisis). Eventually Turner's earlier training at the hands of O-Sensei (not to be confused with the leader of the League) proved too strong for the League to fully break, and when he refused to kill Batman he was forced to flee the League. Not long afterwards, the insane Sensei—no longer motivated by anything but a desire to raise assassination to an art—attempted to cause an artificial earthquake in order to kill a number of diplomats gathered for peace talks. Batman traced Ben Turner to a hospital, foiling a League attempt to assassinate the man. Turner could not fully remember the actions of his alternate personality (although years later, as a member of the Suicide Squad, he would reveal that the League had used him to kill a number of people) but he was able to aid Batman in uncovering the Sensei's latest plot. Although Batman was unable to prevent the earthquake, ultimately it was only the Sensei himself that died in the disaster, and control of the League returned to Ra's.\n\nIt was more recently revealed that, prior to the betrayals of Doctor Daark and the Sensei, Ra's had grown tired of the fickle loyalties of his warriors. Ra's assigned David Cain to create a perfect bodyguard (\"\"The One Who Is All\"\"). After early attempts to raise such a person resulted in hopelessly psychotic children, Cain decided that he needed a genetically suited child and began searching for a possible mother. To this end he assassinated Carolyn Woosan/Wu-San, one of two astonishingly talented martial artist sisters he had seen fighting in an exhibition. Carolyn's sister, Sandra, swore revenge and tracked Cain down, only to be subdued by the combined might of the League. Both intoxicated and frightened by the levels of skill she was attaining now that she was no longer holding back for her sister's sake, Sandra agreed to be the mother of Cain's child. In return, the League spared Sandra's life, and assisted her in further training. By the time Sandra gave birth she had surpassed the entire League in skill. She left immediately following the birth of her daughter, Cassandra Cain, rechristening herself Lady Shiva.\n\nOther stories would suggest that at some points afterwards Shiva worked as a member of the League, and eyewitness testimony from former League member Onyx indicates that she kept in contact with the League, although she apparently did not see her daughter. Although most of her appearances over the years show her working independently, she apparently had some degree of League membership, and was called upon by Ra's to \"rescue\" Talia during the \"\" storyline.\n\nIn keeping with Ra's and Cain's plans, the League attempted to train Cassandra Cain from birth to be the ultimate assassin, unknowingly giving her the skills she would use as the hero Batgirl.\n\nAfter the death of Ra's al Ghul, his first-born daughter Nyssa Raatko formed a new League. Lady Shiva was recruited to serve as the sensei to this incarnation of the League, with the intent that Batgirl (Cassandra Cain) would lead the warriors themselves.\n\nReflecting Shiva's emphasis for martial arts, the known members of Nyssa's League were all skilled in this area, and included the warriors Shrike, Kitty Kumbata, Wam-Wam, Joey N'Bobo, Tigris, Momotado, Krunk, White Willow, the twin warriors Los Gemelos, Ox, Mad Dog, Alpha, and Cristos. The new League was present when Mr. Freeze's wife Nora Fries was brought back to life as the monstrous Lazara, and several members died in the resulting chaos.\n\nDue to the conflict between their loyalty to Shiva and Nyssa and their near-worship of Batgirl as \"The One Who is All\", the League split at that point, with Ox, White Willow, and Tigris pledging themselves to Cassandra. Several more members of the League (including all the defectors except Tigris) died when the insane \"Mad Dog\" went on a killing spree. \"The Mad Dog\", it was revealed, had been one of David Cain's early attempts to create Ra's' perfect warrior. The Mad Dog had been considered useless as a child, since Cain's methods had driven him murderously insane, and Ra's had ordered the child be killed. Nyssa, however, knew that the servant ordered to carry out this execution had instead released him into the wild, explaining how it was possible to recruit him. The Mad Dog was successful in killing Batgirl (who gave her life to protect the burqa-clad assassin Tigris). She was quickly restored to life in a Lazarus Pit by Shiva, in order that the two could face each other in a final battle. Batgirl won leaving Shiva on a meat hook suspended over the Lazarus Pit.\n\nAlthough most of its members had died or defected, the League survived the \"Infinite Crisis\", and was seen to play an important role in the Society's worldwide prison break. Throughout the period of aftermath it remained under the control of Nyssa, until she was apparently killed in a car explosion. Cassandra Cain has apparently taken over the League as its new leader, although she abandoned the League at some point prior to the \"Teen Titans\" storyline \"Titans East\", where it is revealed that she was being drugged by Deathstroke.\n\nFurthermore, it appears that Cassandra was battling for complete control of the League of Assassins with Ra's al Ghul's youngest daughter Talia, as well as the Sensei. Talia, who would naturally assume control of her father's empire by default following Nyssa's death, has recently been seen in the \"Batman and Son\" storyline, leading ninja members of the League of Assassins, against Batman. At the same time, several members felt neither Talia nor Cassandra were up to the role, and, after failing to recruit Black Canary's adopted daughter Sin, gave the leadership to the Sensei, who recently reappeared in the \"Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul\" storyline.\n\nIn \"One Year Later\", Talia al Ghul forced Kirk Langstrom to give her the Man-Bat formula which she used to turn some of its members into Man-Bats. Currently, the League of Assassins and its Man-Bat Commandos are used by Talia as her personal army and bodyguards, carrying her orders and taking retribution over her enemies.\n\nIn the series \"Green Arrow/Black Canary\" #11, a metahuman faction of the League of Assassins was introduced. They were involved in the abduction of an injured Connor Hawke. This group's members included Bear, Tolliver, Ruck, Spike, Mazone, and their leader Targa. However, although they thought they were being commanded by Ra's al Ghul, they were apparently duped by an imposter Shado.\n\nIn \"The New 52\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), the League of Assassins reside in the sacred city of 'Eth Alth'eban. Lady Shiva, Rictus, Cheshire, December Graystone, and Bronze Tiger target Red Hood. They end up capturing Jason Todd and bring him to 'Eth Alth'eban so that he can help lead the League of Assassins. Red Hood has been led to 'Eth Alth'eban, where the League of Assassins resides. Bronze Tiger explains that costumed heroes have been fighting to maintain a broken system—a system that can only be fixed by taking the next step, and culling the weak and wicked from the world. He and the others have chosen Jason to be their leader in taking the action that the world's super-heroes have been too afraid to take. Red Hood admits that he abandoned his friends because he didn't want to be a killer. In response, Bronze Tiger begs the opportunity to show Red Hood how to do real lasting good. The assassins give Jason a tour of the Death Market, where tools of death and murder can be bought, to fill any need provided that the need in question is killing a lot of people. After reuniting with December Graystone, Cheshire, Lady Shiva, and Rictus, Bronze Tiger calls a meeting of the council to which Red Hood is invited. Meanwhile, they are concerned about the security of the city, given the coming war. Rictus assures them that it would take approximately four hundred terawatts of power to break through the city's walls. At their meeting, Red Hood wonders what it is about him that makes them think he can lead them to victory against the Untitled. Bronze Tiger admits amid jeers from his companions that he was told by Talia al Ghul that Red Hood would be the only one who could stop the Untitled if they ever attacked. This comes as a surprise to Red Hood, given that he can't even remember what the Untitled look like. Bronze Tiger reminds that if Jason wants to do good with his life, he can't do much better than to fight against the most powerful force for evil on the planet. Just then, sensors reveal that something is on the perimeter of the city. It is Arsenal and he is heavily armed.\n\nArsenal is using all of his unique inventions to hold back the defensive attacks of the Man-Bat Commandos of the League of Assassins. The first assassin Arsenal encounters is December Graystone and he soon entraps the magician within a block of ice, thanks to some grenades made with technology he stole from Mr. Freeze. Next, Cheshire appears next to him thanks to her teleportation abilities and steals the hat off of his head. However, he spots the teleportation device implanted in her wrist and uses an electrical shock to short it out. That causes the device to malfunction and she disappears completely. During the fight, Red Hood states that he would lead the League of Assassins in exchange that Arsenal and Starfire are unharmed. Starfire reminds Jason that she would rather die than be put in chains again. She warns him that with the last Lazarus Pit uncovered, it can strip away the Untitled's powers, which is why they have come to destroy it. They must not succeed. As she and Arsenal are escorted away, she warns Jason not to die today. As he prepares himself, Red Hood begins to hear a voice from within that explains that his destiny is coming to fruition, and shows him how to make the mystical All-Blades manifest in his hands. Though he doesn't remember what all this means, he hopes it will help, as the Untitled arrive in the sacred city.\n\nOutside the sacred city of 'Eth Alth'eban, December Graystone discovers someone he was not expecting to see waiting outside and curses himself for not realizing that this person had something to do with the battle currently underway in the subterranean city. Red Hood is currently leading the League of Assassins in a charge against the evil Untitled, who had the gall to use Jason's friend Arsenal against him to get into the city. Jason is confused when his swords tell him that by taking bronze shards from the great fountain at the centre of the city, they will be able to drive off the Untitled, but he hopefully passes on the information to his companions. Red Hood finds himself locked in combat with Drakar and the man discovers that what was done to Red Hood's mind was more than a simple mind-wipe. He senses Ducra somewhere within his mind. Red Hood uses Drakar's confusion to steer him toward the fountain, which hides the Well of Sins (the pool that filled the Untitled with evil). Drakar struggles, but collapses into the murky fluid. Having fallen into the Well of Sins, Drakar begs to be removed from it as he can feel the arcane power reaching back inside him, and taking the evil energy within him away. The pool strips Drakar of his power and life-force, spitting him back out as a withered old man. Turning to the remaining Untitled, Red Hood warns that they will all suffer the same fate if they do not surrender. The Untitled respond that he cannot hope to defeat them alone, but Lady Shiva responds by unleashing a swarm of Man-Bats warning that the League of Assassins is death incarnate. When the Untitled have been cast back into the Well of Sins by the League of Assassins, Drakar plans to take Red Hood with him only for Bronze Tiger to snap Drakar's neck. Following Drakar's death, Red Hood admits that killing Drakar was necessary—a key realization for a member of the League of Assassins. Lady Shiva comments that tonight, they will see all the remaining Untitled dead as well, but Jason responds that they cannot simply kill without his say-so if he is to be the League's leader. Suddenly, a cloaked figure appears, noting that he expected more after coming all this way, just to find a leader of assassins who orders his warriors to sheathe their blades. The man warns that the game is over, and Jason's part in it is done, as he makes his way toward the Well of Sins. Jason stands in his way, demanding to know who this man is. The man responds that he is the one who gave the Untitled the location of the Acres of All knowing that they would kill Ducra and return to this place. He knew they would fall here, and imbue the Well of Sins with a greater power than he had ever tasted—a power that he would now take for himself, having planned this moment for three centuries. Emerging from the pit, the man introduces himself as Ra's al Ghul.\n\nJason is under attack by Ra's al Ghul who demands to know just what his daughter Talia al Ghul saw in the boy. Having just emerged from the Well of Sins, Ra's al Ghul is consumed by the evil that once corrupted the Untitled centuries ago. Now he feels compelled to rid himself of the machinations of his daughter and Ducra by killing Jason. At Ra's al Ghul's command, the prisoners are brought to him, and he promises to use his new found power to see them dead. Red Hood, however, determines that he cannot allow it to happen. As Ra's al Ghul gathers his power, Red Hood tells himself again and again that he wants to remember what he chose to forget. At last, the images rush through his mind, and begin to reform as memories. Unfortunately, the revelation occurs earlier than Ducra had planned. Having regained all of his training with Batman as well, Jason is free of his chains almost instantly. His training with Lady Shiva sees him making short work of the League's Man-Bats. He uses that same training to best Lady Shiva herself, only to be attacked by Bronze Tiger next. In the meantime though, Cheshire (whose loyalty to the League of Assassin's returned master is waning) attempts to rescue Roy and Kori. Before long, the pair are free to aid Red Hood in his fight. Smirking, he welcomes them back, apologizing for his having deceived them. They are confused, unaware that his decision to erase his memory was part of a grander plan. Red Hood engages Ra's al Ghul as Essence joins the battle. She insists that he will allow Jason and his friends to leave his realm, or he will be forced to die a mortal death just as he always feared he would. Despite having destroyed the All-Caste, Ra's' actions have led to their eventual rebirth. Defeated, he swears that he will visit great agony upon Red Hood if he sees him ever again.\n\nTalia al Ghul's own organization, Leviathan, is a schism of the League of Assassins created to counter Batman's \"Batman Incorporated\".\n\nBatman and Aquaman head to an island where the League of Assassins are, after Ra's al Ghul had the bodies of Damian Wayne and Talia al Ghul exhumed. Batman and Aquaman storm the beach, breaking through the island's defences of Man-Bats, only to find that the source of the whales' screaming was on the island. Ra's al Ghul had ordered the hunt of whales, creating genetically altered super-humans in the wombs of sperm whales. This being just one of a probable many plans to rebuild the League of Assassins. Aquaman swears vengeance on the whales' behalves. Inside the compound, they find that Ra's is wiping the hard drives clean, preventing data recovery, even as a message from Ra's plays over the intercom, chastising Batman for failing to prevent the deaths of Damian or Talia within the city he swore to protect. As his parting gift, he has left Batman the Heretics to keep him entertained. Batman reels as he sees all of the grotesque and mutated failed clones of failed Damians. As they fight for their lives, Batman warns Aquaman not to kill any of these monstrosities. They are too developmentally malformed to comprehend what they had done to those whales in being born. Suddenly, Bruce realizes that if the Heretics were born of a whale's womb, Arthur might be able to telepathically link up with them. He leads them out into the ocean, where an unharmed whale breaches, and swallows them whole. Batman, meanwhile, fights his way to Ra's escape aircraft. He sees Talia and Damian's bodies stored within it, and clings to the fuselage from outside as the plane takes off. Though Ra's al Ghul plans to go to Paradise Island, he is nearly surprised to see Batman pounding on the cockpit's windshield. From outside, Batman screams for Ra's al Ghul to give back his son, but Ra's al Ghul responds that he is blood of Damian's blood and the boy is in good hands. He orders the plane to tilt its angle, causing the wind shear to rip Batman from his purchase and drop down into the sea. Luckily, Aquaman is there to catch him. Arthur explains that all of the Heretics are alive, having been taken down to Atlantis for safe keeping, by a whale.\n\nIn the DC Rebirth relaunch universe, the League of Assassins and League of Shadows are two separate organizations. The League of Assassins consists of Ra's Al Ghul's standard followers. The League of Shadows is the more mysterious of the two and is often considered a myth, but are said to have people everywhere and to have a plan to \"bring the entire nation to the ground\".\n\n\nOther members of the League of Assassins include:\n\n\n\nIn \"\", Batman 'inherits' control of the League of Assassins after Bruce Wayne tracks down the organisation and accepts a deal where he and Ra's enter the same Lazarus Pit at once; Ra's has determined that if two souls enter the pit, one will perish while the other will become immortal without needing to keep using the Pit, Bruce accepts the offer and Ra's al Ghul is destroyed. With Ra's al Ghul gone, Batman uses Ra's' criminal empire to set up an anti-crime and humanitarian network by subtly changing the organization's goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1998975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1998975", "title": "Dumb Type", "text": "Dumb Type\n\nDumb Type is an artist collective based in Kyoto, Japan. It was founded in 1984.\n\nDumb type is a group of creative art forms that express the new and daily life of the twentieth century modern and technological world of Japan. During the 1980s Dumb Type created their first show representing the idea of how technology is arising a dark matter through people's daily lives. Present day they have created 4 more shows since. The productions are performed among many members who are skilled in music, architecture, visual artists, choreography, and computer programming. The variety of forms helps create an entertaining show like no other.\n\nMembers are trained in varied disciplines, including visual arts, theatre, dance, architecture, music composition and computer programming. Their work ranges across such diverse media as art exhibitions, performances, audiovisuals and publications.\nDumb Type is known for portraying a dark, cynical, and humorous world in which technology is a way of life—if not necessarily a welcome one. In a 1990 interview in High Performance, the late Teiji Furuhashi, one of Dumb Type's founding members, described their work as political in nature. \"Something Japanese theater never does. Japanese audiences don't want to see that. They want to avoid it. They just want entertainment. Yes, I think we should always have a political view. We should represent that this is Japan.\" Notable in a country plagued by political apathy, the group has played the unpopular role of AIDS activist, organizing symposia and other events, motivated in part by the fact that Furuhashi died of AIDS in 1995.\n\"Dumb Type’s\" name was influenced by the English words’ “mute” or “stupid.” The founded leader of the group Furuhashi, suggested that the name “Dumb Type” expressed an idea of the reality that Japan has become because it's technology and the attraction to the media. The society around Japan became very superficial and everyone was aware of the media around them but felt overwhelmed with all the information given to them. This inspired the artistic performances expressing their feelings about it. \nWhile based in Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital, Dumb Type is oriented more to the global than the local, the contemporary over the traditional. Dumb Type members claim that Japanese art movements have had little influence on their work. Furuhashi explained that the core group—Furuhashi, Toru Koyamada, Yukihiro Hozumi, Shiro Takatani, Takayuki Fujimoto and Hiromasa Tomari—began working together in 1982, while still students at Kyoto City University of Arts. \"We were frustrated artists, and wanted to start creating something new with our skills. Most of the time we spent discussing society or whatever, not specific art things. When someone had an idea it would be presented on a piece of paper. If the group was interested, we made it come true. At first the idea would be really open, then gradually it became something very specific. In that way, we're really democratic. Dumb Type is a collaborative group; we don't want a king.\"\n\nTheir work has been exhibited and performed at notable venues internationally.\n\n"}

On her way to Ashby Wake Cassie is hit by a car. The driver of the car, Mrs Marion Kirkman (Kerry Fox), immediately calls an ambulance. During an examination at the local hospital the doctor concludes Cassie only has some scratches and not even a concussion, but Cassie has lost her memory due to the accident. She only knows her name and mother country, but she does not know which town she comes from, who her family is and why she is in England. The doctor explains to her that the loss of memory is caused by a shock and that she will regain it after some recuperation. As a result of the examination Cassie is checked out. Marion Kirkman invites Cassie to stay at her house until she has overcome her loss of memory, because Mrs Kirkman feels guilty and responsible for the lonely girl who nobody knows.\n\nWhile recovering, Cassie is drawn into a deeper mystery, which seems to involve her hosts and other people she sees about the town. Her lack of memory compounds the air of suspense as she encounters a man named Dan Blakely (Ioan Gruffudd), whom she believes she knows, but with no idea from where. Cassie becomes very attached to Marion Kirkman's son, Michael (Harry Forrester) and becomes acquainted with her husband Simon (Stephen Dillane), an art historian, who is in the process of examining a church from Early Christianity (built in Glastonbury during the first century AD) after the arrival of Joseph of Arimathea. This church was recently discovered by two visitors to the Glastonbury Festival who died after falling down a hole through the open roof of the buried church. In the Church there is an unusual relief made of stone, which illustrates the crucifixion of Christ. Also depicted are many curious onlookers who appear to be observing the gruesome scene.\n\nDuring the next few days, Cassie has visions of the future of the people around her. She also recognises certain people who seem to watch her and often appear in a certain place in Glastonbury which she visits. She observes the strange auto mechanic Frederick Michael Argyle (Peter McNamara) and examines his belongings, which include a scrapbook containing news clippings that detail accusations of child abuse at a local orphanage, that were ignored by the townspeople. The orphanage turns out to be the house the Kirkmans now live in. Cassie finds that Argyle was one of the children who was abused and that he identifies himself with the young Michael. She discovers that Argyle is planning to take revenge on the people of the town for their cruelty to him. Cassie suspects that a catastrophe is imminent, but she is unable to persuade anyone else of the impending danger she senses. She eventually finds out that the relief in the church illustrates a group of people known as \"The Gathering\". They are immortal and damned to watch catastrophes and murders for eternity as they stopped to watch the crucifixion of Christ out of morbid curiosity, a concept similar to the legend of the Wandering Jew. The priest and Bishop also discover this, and the priest rushes to inform Mr Kirkman. However, on the way he sees the \"Gathering\" on a bridge over the highway, and dies in a car accident as a result. The Gathering merely watch. Later that same day, Cassie experiences visions where she watches a young Argyle dragged into the house by the orphanage priest while three of the town's leading figures watch and laugh. The priest then drags the child into a nearby room where he further abuses the child and is joined by the other three men. Cassie follows the men into the room, only to wake from the vision to see Michael standing over pictures of the archaeological site. Cassie then finds one of the photographs, which seems to horrify her.\n\nHowever, after the priest's accident, the Bishop is able to pass on this strange news to Mr Kirkman, who realises that his family is in great danger. He hastens to drive home to try to prevent whatever is fated to occur. Cassie is then seen attending the local festival with the Kirkman children only to then see the strange people gathering around the fairgrounds. She attempts to warn the police once more of Argyle's intent, but instead discovers Dan, who has killed the officer on duty. He then reveals that he is one of the Gathering, who have since stopped simply watching the world's tragedies but have also begun to set up the potential tragedies to be more likely to happen. Cassie manages to prevent Argyle from killing festival goers with a bomb, but is unable to stop him taking revenge upon the men who had abused him. After a harrowing chase, Cassie sacrifices her life to save the lives of the children of the Kirkman family. Mr Kirkman arrives just in time to stop Argyle from killing his family. At the end it is revealed that Cassie also belongs to \"The Gathering\", because just after she \"dies\", she appears standing among them as they stare at Argyle being electrocuted. Cassie is shown to be weeping while the others just stand there and watch impassively. Because Cassie has shown compassion and tried to prevent evil deeds, her life of wandering will end and she will find peace, which she tells the son of Mr Kirkman at night on the same day.\n\nSimilarities with the Ray Bradbury story \"The Crowd\" have been noted.\n\n\nThe production team visited Penshurst Place in Kent to film at the Barons Hall, which doubled up as part of the Church where the Bishop held meetings with the Clergy. The external filming of the church was Wells Cathedral in Somerset, England.\n\nThere are two different versions of the film. In the USA, the United Kingdom and in Germany only an abridged version was published on DVD, which is 13 minutes shorter than the original. A sex scene and many dialogues were left out. This abridged version lasts exactly 83:31 (PAL-DVD). \nThe unabridged TV version, shown on ZDF in Germany and on BBC in the UK, and released on DVD in France, Poland and Japan, lasts approx. 97 minutes (PAL) and 101 minutes (NTSC).\n\n\n"}

In 1952, when the Portuguese Laws of Banishment were repealed, the Duke moved his family to Portugal, thus returning the Miguelist Braganzas to their homeland and becoming the first of the former Portuguese royal dynasty to live in Portugal since the deposition of the monarchy, in 1910.\n\nOnce established in Portugal, the Duke was granted a pension and residence by the \"Fundação da Casa de Bragança\", the organization has owned and managed all the private assets of the House of Braganza, since the death of King Manuel II, in 1932. Duarte Nuno spent the rest of his life attempting, without success, the restoration of all Brigantine assets to his family and recreating the image of the Miguelist Braganzas in Portuguese society, all under the goal of the restoration of the Portuguese monarchy, under the Braganzas.\n\nIn 1942, the Duarte Nuno married Princess Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza, daughter of Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará. Their marriage reconciled two branches of the House of Braganza, in two different ways, reuniting the Portuguese and Brazilian Brigantine houses and specifically reuniting the Miguelist and Liberal Braganzas, which had been estranged since 1828, when the War of Two Brothers was waged between King-Emperor Pedro IV & I, founder of the Liberal Braganzas, and King Miguel I, founder of the Miguelist Braganzas. The couple had three sons, the eldest of whom is Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, the current pretender to the defunct Portuguese throne.\n\n\"Duarte Nuno Fernando Maria Miguel Gabriel Rafael Francisco Xavier Raimundo António\" was born at Seebenstein Castle in Austria-Hungary, the son of Miguel, Duke of Braganza and of his second wife, Princess Maria Theresa of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Duarte Nuno had two older half-brothers, one older half-sister and eight sisters.\n\nHis paternal grandparents were Miguel I of Portugal and Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. His maternal grandparents were Charles, 6th Prince of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, and Princess Sophie of Liechtenstein.\n\nDuarte Nuno's father was the Miguelist claimant to the throne of Portugal who opposed his cousins, the reigning line of the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha descended from Queen Maria II. Duarte Nuno's family had been disinherited and banished by Maria II for rebellion. In spite of this, with the permission of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, Portuguese soil had been placed under the bed where he was born, so that Duarte Nuno and his siblings could claim to have been born on Portuguese soil in order to comply with the Portuguese law of succession.\n\nThe day after his birth, Duarte Nuno was baptised at Seebenstein. His godparents were his aunt the Infanta Adelgundes, Duchess of Guimarães and the husband of another aunt, the Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime (both of whom were represented by proxies).\n\nDuarte Nuno's second brother, Prince Francis Joseph of Braganza, died in 1919, and on 21 July 1920 his eldest brother, Prince Miguel, Duke of Viseu, renounced his succession rights. Ten days later on 31 July 1920 Duarte Nuno's father, Miguel, abdicated his claim to the Portuguese throne in favour of Duarte Nuno. Henceforth the Miguelists recognised Duarte Nuno as \"King Duarte II of Portugal\", even though Portugal had become a republic in 1910 when Maria II's great-grandson, King Manuel II (who was still living in 1920), was sent into exile. Duarte Nuno used \"Duke of Braganza\" as a title of pretense.\n\nSince Duarte Nuno was only twelve years old when he succeeded as Miguelist claimant to the Portuguese throne, his aunt, the Duchess of Guimarães, acted as regent for him until he attained his majority. In 1921, she issued a manifesto outlining the family's goals for the restoration of the monarchy.\n\nThe renouncement of Duarte Nuno's father was intended to improve the relationship between the two monarchist groups in Portugal: the supporters of the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg line of Manuel II and the supporters of the Miguelist line of Duarte Nuno. The Braganza-Saxe-Coburg line was called \"constitutional\" because it had accepted a liberal constitution for Portugal.\n\nAfter the death of his uncle Afonso in 1920, ex-King Manuel II had no close relatives who could claim the throne according to the Constitutional Charter of 1826 (the constitution in force from 1842 until the overthrow of the monarchy in 1910). The conflict between the Miguelist line and the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha's was not just about which person should be sovereign; it was also about how much power the sovereign should have. The Miguelists upheld Portugal's tradition of autocratic absolutism, while the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha's adhered to constitutional monarchy.\n\nIn 1912, Duarte Nuno's father, Miguel, met with Manuel to try to come to some agreement so that there would not be two claimants to the Portuguese throne, both living in exile. Their representatives allegedly signed the \"Pact of Dover\" by which Miguel recognised Manuel as king, while Manuel recognised the succession rights of Duarte Nuno should Manuel and his uncle Afonso die without children. The pact was unpopular with the supporters of both sides, some claiming that it was never actually signed.\n\nOn 17 April 1922 a second agreement called the \"Pact of Paris\" was signed by the representatives of Duarte Nuno and Manuel in which Manuel agreed that the \"Cortes\" should select his heir if he died without descendants, while Duarte Nuno agreed to ask and recommend that his followers accept Manuel as king-in-exile.\n\nStrictly speaking the \"Pact of Dover\" and the \"Pact of Paris\" were private agreements, legally unenforceable. Nor did King Manuel agree to any provision in the latter pact which contravened Portugal's last monarchist constitution. But the agreements were important steps in reconciling the Miguelist and the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg branches of Portugal's royal family, and helped move the supporters of each toward a united monarchist movement.\n\nIn 1927, Duarte Nuno's father died. On 2 July 1932 Manuel II died. Henceforth, the majority of monarchists, both Miguelist and constitutional, supported Duarte Nuno as claimant to the Portuguese throne. João António de Azevedo Coutinho, the head of Causa Monárquica and Manuel II's lieutenant while he was in exile, published a declaration in support of Duarte Nuno. Later Duarte Nuno was received in audience in Paris by Manuel's mother, Queen Amelie.\n\nWhile Duarte Nuno was accepted by most monarchists, there were some constitutionalists who continued to contest his claim. Duarte Nuno was undisputed as the legal heir of his grandfather, Miguel I, but there were doubts about whether he was the legal heir of the last reigning king of Portugal, Manuel II. Articles 87 and 88 of the Constitutional Charter of 1826, in force when the monarchy was overthrown, stated that the throne passed first to the descendants of Queen Maria II (from whom Duarte Nuno was not descended), and only when they were extinct to collateral heirs. Maria II had living descendants in 1932, but none of these had Portuguese nationality. Article 89 of the 1826 Charter stipulated that \"no foreigner may succeed to the crown of the kingdom of Portugal\".\n\nThere was also some doubt about Duarte Nuno's nationality. Duarte Nuno's grandfather had been sent into exile by the law of 19 December 1834. Neither Duarte Nuno nor his father were born in Portugal, but Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria had granted extraterritoriality to Duarte Nuno's birthplace. Article 8 of the 1826 Charter stated that Portuguese citizenship is lost \"by those who are banished by sentence\". The fact that Duarte Nuno and his father had not been born in Portugal, and the fact that their family had been banished from Portugal left it unclear whether their branch's Portuguese citizenship had been preserved uninterruptedly. However, Dom Duarte's line was banished by law rather than by judicial sentence, and the 1834 constitution in force at the time of D. Miguel I's banishment did not protect the citizenship of those exiled by law. On the other hand, when the Constitutional Charter of 1826 was re-instated in 1842, it cancelled the 1834 charter's clause depriving Miguel I and his heirs of succession rights as dynasts. Their banishment had not, however, been stipulated in that charter, but in a separate law that was not repealed until 1950.\n\nA minority of monarchists considered a candidate other than Duarte Nuno. Manuel's genealogical heir at his death in 1932 was ex-Crown Prince George of Saxony (a great-grandson of Maria II), but he was not Portuguese; he was also a Catholic priest. George's siblings have descendants living, but none is known to have had Portuguese citizenship.\n\nThe genealogical heir of Maria II's younger brother Emperor Pedro II of Brazil was his great-grandson Prince Pedro Gastão of Orléans-Braganza; he too was not Portuguese, but the fact that he was Brazilian and therefore imbued with Portuguese culture made him a somewhat attractive candidate.\n\nThe closest heir who was undoubtedly Portuguese was Constança Berquó de Mendonça, 4th Duchess of Loulé (a great-great-granddaughter of King John VI), but her branch of the family put forth no claim at that time, nor did King Manuel II ever consider it. Many scholars claim the Loulé lost their rights to the throne since the secret marriage of the Infanta Ana de Jesus with the Marquis of Loulé had not been authorised by either the competent authority, the \"Cortes\", nor by the Regency Committee, although it had been authorised by the Infanta-Regent. Nevertheless, the Portuguese constitution demanded more, a marriage \"at King's appraisal\", whereas the Infanta-Regent said expressly that she only authorised her sister's marriage \"because her mother assumed all the responsibility\". Moreover, both Kings Miguel and her father, previously, expressly forbade the marriage.\n\nA woman calling herself Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança, claimed to be the bastard daughter of King Carlos I. She also claimed to have been recognised by the King as possessing succession rights. Her supporters played upon the traditional rivalry between the Miguelist line and the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line to advance her cause.\n\nDuarte Nuno's first tutors were two Portuguese ladies, Maria Luisa Castelo and Maria das Dores de Sousa Prego. Later he was taught by the Benedictine monk Frei Estevao from the monastery of Cucujães. Duarte Nuno attended school at the Abbey of Ettal in Bavaria and the Abbey of Clairvaux in France and then completed his secondary education in Regensburg. He received a degree in agricultural sciences from the University of Toulouse. Although forbidden entry to Portugal by the law of exile against the descendants of Miguel I, he visited the country in secret in 1929.\n\nOn 15 October 1942, in the cathedral of Petrópolis in Brazil, Duarte Nuno married Princess Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza (8 September 1914 – 15 January 1968), daughter of Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará. The marriage was particularly popular since Maria Francisca was the great-granddaughter of Pedro II of Brazil, the younger brother of Queen Maria II. The marriage thus united the two rival lines of the Portuguese royal family. Maria Francisca and her family were also viewed as representatives of a liberal monarchy as opposed to the traditional conservatism of Duarte Nuno's family.\n\nOn 27 May 1950 the National Assembly repealed the laws of exile of 19 December 1834 and 15 October 1910. Duarte Nuno, however, did not return to Portugal until 1952 on account of a car accident in Thionville in which he was seriously injured. He was presented with a residence in Portugal by the \"Fundação Casa de Bragança\".\n\nPortuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar thought about restoring the monarchy in 1951, after the death of President Óscar Carmona, but he chose instead to hold the 1951 Portuguese presidential election and maintain the post of republican Head of State as it had appeared in the Constitution of 1933.\n\nIn 1974, Duarte Nuno handed over his residence, the \"Palácio de São Marcos\", to the University of Coimbra. From then until his death two years later, he lived in southern Portugal with his unmarried sister, the Infanta Filippa. American author Walter J. P. Curley interviewed Duarte Nuno near the end of his life, and his book \"Monarchs in Waiting\" describes Duarte Nuno as suffering from \"nervous depression\" since the death of his wife.\n\nDuarte Nuno was Grand Master of the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa and Sovereign of the Order of Saint Isabel. He was a Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and a Knight of the (Austrian) Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nDuarte Nuno is buried in the Augustinian monastery in Vila Viçosa, the traditional burial place of the Dukes of Braganza.\n\n\nAs the head of the House of Braganza, Duarte Nuno held the following positions:\n\n"}
{"id": "1999008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999008", "title": "Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)", "text": "Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)\n\nConnor Hawke is a fictional DC Comics superhero who operated as the second Green Arrow, created by Kelley Puckett and Jim Aparo. Connor is the son of Oliver Queen, the original Green Arrow, and his former girlfriend Sandra \"Moonday\" Hawke. Connor Hawke first appeared in \"Green Arrow\" (volume 2) #0 (1994).\n\nFollowing the \"Flashpoint\" storyline and 2011's New 52 reboot, Connor has yet to be reintroduced into DC's primary storytelling continuity. An alternative universe version of Connor does however appear in the series \"Earth 2\", as a World Army member named Red Arrow who assists the Wonders in the war with Darkseid.\n\nOutside of comics, multiple versions of Connor appear in The CW's Arrowverse, where he has been both a biological and an adopted son of John Diggle, rather than Oliver's, played by Joseph David-Jones. Another loose adaptation of the story, which involves Oliver discovering he has an illegitimate son named William Clayton, is also depicted on \"Arrow\" with the present day version played by Jack Moore and the future adult version played by Ben Lewis.\n\nConnor Hawke met Oliver Queen after Oliver came to stay at the ashram where Connor had been studying for some years. Oliver who had previously retreated to the ashram decades before, looking for peace after accidentally killing a criminal (in \"The Flash\" (Vol 2) #217), returned to the ashram under similar circumstances, haunted by the thought that he had killed his former best friend Hal Jordan, who, at the time, was involuntarily serving as the host of the supervillain Parallax. Thanks to Connor, who was a big fan of Green Arrow, Oliver was able to regain a semblance of inner peace and venture out into the world again, especially after numerous attempts on his life had been made.\n\nConnor decided to journey with Oliver, and created a costume similar to his. Connor served as Oliver's sidekick, also meeting with Eddie Fyers, the former federal agent that acted as a form of counsel for Oliver. It was during this time that Oliver learned about his connection to Connor from the ghost of Hal Jordan: Connor was Oliver's son, conceived during Oliver's college years. Eddie Fyers had already deduced this, but Oliver did not take the revelation well. He subsequently agreed to go undercover in an eco-terrorist group called the Eden Corps for the government. The mission turned out to be fatal for Oliver, as his arm was connected to a bomb in a plane that was headed for Metropolis. Rather than endanger Metropolis, and refusing to allow his arm to be amputated, he sacrificed himself to let the bomb explode away from the city. With his father dead, Connor decided to take up the mantle of Green Arrow and continue his hero's work.\n\nConnor continued to travel with Eddie, accompanied at times by Connor's martial arts mentor Master Jansen. Connor tried to find his place not only in the hero world, but also in the legacy of Green Arrow. Akin to the friendship between his father and Hal Jordan, Connor became quick friends with the new Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), who himself was struggling to live up to a legacy. Connor also met Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance), Oliver's former and longtime romantic interest, who gave him one of Oliver's old bows, which Connor would use from then on (though the news that Oliver was dead had sent Black Canary, who was already suffering from a string of misfortunes – loss of income from the destruction of her florist shop and the loss of her superhuman ability – into a despair, it was finally ended by her association with Oracle and she was Oracle's agent by the time she finally met Connor).\n\nBesides making other friends such as Robin (Tim Drake), he also made significant enemies in the fighting world, including the Silver Monkey, an assassin and member of the Monkey Fist martial arts cult. Their first encounter resulted in a decisive loss for Connor, which was also filmed and sold underground. Connor's close win in a rematch resulted in a loss of face for the Monkey Fist cult and set Connor on a path that would bring him face to face with Lady Shiva, said to be the deadliest assassin in the world. During the Brotherhood of the Fist storyline, the Monkey Fist schools attacked various world-class martial artists attempting to prove their worthiness and skill after having been dishonored by the Silver Monkey's loss. Under the alias \"Paper Monkey,\" Shiva arrived in Gotham City where Connor had allied with Batman, Nightwing, and Robin. Shiva's final opponent was Connor, who was the prime target of the Monkey Fist. Though a close and taxing contest, Shiva was the victor, with Connor unconscious and defenseless. Thankfully, Shiva's old pupil, Tim Drake who had saved her life during a previous encounter, asked her not to kill Connor, trading a life for a life. After warning Robin that using the favor now meant she would challenge and kill the boy wonder when he was older, she refrained from killing Connor and departed. Batman warned Connor that he would be perceived as surviving a battle with Shiva through his own skill and would therefore be a possible target for any fighters building their way up to a battle against her.\n\nConnor also applied for membership in the JLA, replacing his father. On the date of his second interview, he singlehandedly saved the League from the hands of the Key, defeating the Key's robots by using his father's old trick arrows after the Key had destroyed his own. In the end, he knocked out the Key using his father's trademark boxing glove arrow, and was accepted as a member of the JLA.\n\nHe would later be used by Batman as a \"traitor\" in the League in a ploy to defeat Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang. Connor left the League afterward, feeling he was better suited for the street-level work and out of his element in the epic adventures of the Justice League, although he did remain on reserve status. During this time, he also developed a friendship with Kyle Rayner, the latest Green Lantern, occasionally contacting Kyle for help if he felt that he was dealing with a problem that went beyond his skillset. One unique mission against the Eden Corps- the organisation responsible for Oliver Queen's death- saw Connor team up with a temporally-displaced Hal Jordan, pulled from early in his career as a hero, with the two musing on how they had each never had a chance to know Oliver (As Hal was from a point before he had developed his close ties to the archer). He and Eddie returned for a time to the ashram where Connor was raised, although they both often returned to the outside world, aiding Robin at one point when his Brentwood Academy roommate had been attacked by a demon, and again when Robin, the Spoiler, and Batgirl were attempting to protect Robin's father from an ancient cult.\n\nWhen Oliver returned from the dead, Connor left the ashram and tracked him down. After Connor manages to save his father from warlock Stanley Dover, Connor and Oliver move in together in Star City. The two live with Mia Dearden, a runaway that Oliver has taken in and trained as his new sidekick Speedy. Since returning to the superhero life, Connor has been wounded seriously twice, once by the villain called Onomatopoeia and once by Constantine Drakon, but he continues in his hero role. He is the voice of reason for Oliver, and the two have since formed a real father-son relationship. During his recovery from Onomatopoeia's attack, Oliver Queen and his former sidekick Roy Harper went on a trip across the country recovering old possessions. One of them was an old photograph which revealed that Oliver had been present at Connor's birth, but later ran from the responsibility of being a father. Oliver kept this fact from his son. However, Connor already learned the truth years ago from his mother, and has already forgiven him without Oliver's knowledge.\n\nDuring the 2006 \"One Year Later\" storyline, Connor is revealed, to be on an island with Mia Dearden and Oliver Queen as Oliver trains for his return to Star City.\n\nIn November 2006, Connor starred in his own six issue miniseries, entitled \"Connor Hawke: Dragon's Blood.\" It was written by Chuck Dixon with art by Derec Donovan. Dixon stated, \"A big surprise leads to major changes in Connor's life, particularly as it relates to his father.\"\n\nAt the end of Tony Bedard's \"Black Canary\" miniseries, Connor takes Dinah's adoptive daughter Sin to a safe location at Oliver's request. After the wedding of Oliver and Black Canary, Connor resumes the mantle of Green Arrow after it is believed that his father has once more been killed. Along with Dinah and Batman, Connor is one of the few people who believes that Oliver is still alive. His suspicions are confirmed when it is revealed that Oliver is being held captive by the Amazons, and Connor and Dinah decide to stage a rescue attempt. Following the rescue of Oliver, as the family is reunited, Connor is shot through the chest by League of Assassins members manipulated by Shado. After taking Connor to the hospital, Oliver learns from Mia that Connor already knew of his father's abandonment. The doctors and Hal Jordan are able to save his life, but the bullet was coated with a devastating toxin, leaving Connor in a persistent vegetative state from which he may never emerge. Oliver is devastated by the knowledge that his son may never wake up and that Connor had forgiven him years ago. He vows never to leave his son again.\n\nHowever, after Oliver and Dinah return home from getting married (the first marriage being void, with an imposter posing as Oliver), the nurses tending to Connor are found dead, with Connor himself missing. Oliver begins a quest to find his missing son. This quest leads him to Doctor Sivana, who has utilized a neural patch to turn Connor into a mindless drone. Connor is rescued by Oliver and returned to his hospital bed, where he finally awakens from his comatose state.\n\nAfter his coma, however, Connor starts exhibiting several unusual traits. Physically healthy, he's now amnesiac and oblivious to everything happened to him before waking up (even his life as a superhero) and he feels no pain at all and exhibits a strong healing factor, forcing Dinah to ask for outside help.\n\nA brief examination of his physical make-up, made by Batman and Doctor Mid-Nite, reveals how his DNA is now spliced with Plastic Man's, along with several other alterations fully accounting for his new healing factor and his currently very high pain threshold. His memories however come back only in a fragmentary, confused way, with none of the emotional attachments previously experienced, and his archery prowess was absent. To make up for his inability to use ranged weaponry Connor retains his mastery of the martial arts, enhanced by his advanced healing factor, able to close up bullet wounds in mere seconds.\n\nDuring the 2009–2010 \"Blackest Night\" storyline, Connor travels to Coast City and faces Oliver after he has been transformed into a Black Lantern by Nekron. Connor once again takes the mantle of Green Arrow. During their battle, Oliver mocks Connor by telling him that he always hated him because he reminded him of how old he was getting. Connor is hesitant to fight his father, but eventually stops him by spraying him with liquid nitrogen, freezing him solid. After Oliver's defeat, Connor, Mia, and Dinah join in the fight against the other Black Lanterns.\n\nAfter this, Connor returns to the ruins of Star City (which had been destroyed just prior to \"Blackest Night\") and tries to help maintain order. Connor is approached by Oliver, now a fugitive after having murdered Prometheus, the villain that destroyed the city in the first place. Oliver tries to talk to his son, but Connor angrily states that his battle with his Black Lantern father somehow jogged his memory, and that he now remembers all the terrible things Oliver had done to him. When Oliver tells Connor that he had thought he had forgiven him, Connor states that he no longer has the strength to forgive him for his transgressions. Though he refuses to turn Oliver over to the Justice League, he also refuses to help him, instead telling him to do the right thing for once in his life.\n\nFollowing DC Comics' 2011 reboot of its continuity, The New 52, Green Arrow stories reverted to depicting a young Oliver Queen, with no known son. However, a revised interpretation of Connor Hawke appears in the series \"Earth 2\", which is set in an alternative universe within the DC Comics Multiverse. In \"Earth 2 Annual\" #1, an archer named Red Arrow debuts and is recruited to join the World Army; he is believed to be identified by the name Roy McQueen. In \"Earth 2\" #20, it is revealed that his name is Connor Hawke. This version of Connor is seemingly killed by monsters unleashed by the invading forces of the planet Apokolips. The series \"\" shows a successor Earth 2 Red Arrow to be Oliver Queen.\n\nConnor is of mixed Asian, African, and European heritage (his mother was half black and half Korean, and his father Oliver is white), and was originally depicted with Asiatic features, dark skin, and fair hair and eyes. However, this has not been consistently maintained across different artists and colorists, and when the \"Green Arrow\" series was rebooted the character was depicted with European features and light skin (even though a childhood picture in the later \"Archer's Quest\" storyline depicted him with dark skin). Connor's original features were later restored with Dixon's \"Dragon Blood\" miniseries. He now appears to have a mix of Asian and African facial features.\n\nThe Earth 2 version of Connor Hawke in the New 52 resembles Roy Harper more than his pre-\"Flashpoint\" counterpart, with light skin and red hair.\n\nThere's been confusion as to the identity of Connor's mother. Throughout the later issues of the first \"Green Arrow\" series written by Chuck Dixon, Connor's mother was identified as Sandra \"Moonday\" Hawke; a flighty ex-hippie, who had reportedly been one of many conquests for a young Oliver Queen. Moonday played a frequent supporting role in the series, often requiring rescue due to the machinations of her husband - an arms dealer named Milo Armitage, who would be a frequent foe of the new Green Arrow.\n\nShado, a murderer who also mothered a child with Oliver Queen, is often identified as Connor Hawke's mother. One reason for this is because of a \"Wizard Magazine\" issue, which identified Connor's first appearance in comics being in \"Green Arrow\" vol. 2 #24. While this was the first appearance of Shado's infant son (who was later revealed to be named Robert), Connor appeared as a man in his early-twenties in \"Green Arrow\" vol. 2 #0. Both Robert and Connor were seen together, many years apart in age, in Chuck Dixon's 2007 \"Dragon's Blood\" miniseries. Furthermore, in \"Birds of Prey\" #109, in which Barbara Gordon identifies Shado as Connor Hawke's mother when running down a list of women with whom Oliver Queen cheated on long-time girlfriend Dinah Lance. Writer Tony Bedard acknowledged this as an error on his part.\n\nConnor possesses no powers, he is merely an expert archer (although not the natural his father is). Due to his influence most of the \"arrow team\" has begun to use regular pointed arrows consistently. However, they will still engage in use of trick arrows when needed.\n\nDue to Connor's training in the ashram, he can mimic fighting styles that he witnesses, though this is a learned skill and not a metahuman power. Writer Chuck Dixon used the Brotherhood of the Fist storyline to establish Connor as being among the best hand-to-hand combatants in the world, even going so far as to fight Richard Dragon to a standstill, in a battle for the title of the World's Deadliest Martial Artist, only losing to Lady Shiva. One Year After \"Infinite Crisis,\" Connor furthered his training, and like his father and Mia, is able to wield a sword proficiently.\n\nAccording to the 2007 miniseries, \"Connor Hawke: Dragon's Blood\", Connor has possibly received some measure of immortality, enhanced strength, and speed by bathing in the blood of a dragon. However, no mention of this has been made since the miniseries.\n\nAfter the events told in the \"Green Arrow and Black Canary\" 2008 series, Connor is infected with a brain-damaging neurotoxin and spliced with DNA coming from Plastic Man and other still unnamed sources; as a result, he's left largely amnesiac and unable to wield a bow with the necessary ability and coordination, but he's granted a highly effective healing factor and an even higher pain threshold. His martial arts mastery however is not influenced by his brain damage: in fact, coupled with his newly discovered metahuman powers, this makes him a feared warrior, almost unable to be deterred by pain and wounds. During the battle with Oliver during the \"Blackest Night\", Connor is shown to be very proficient in the use of Japanese shuriken. After the \"Blackest Night,\" Connor regained his memories.\n\nConnor Hawke appears in \"Adventures in the DC Universe\" #13 and #16.\n\nThe Earth-16 version of the character appears in \"The Multiversity: The Just\" #1 (December, 2014). He is son of Oliver Queen and the father of Arrowette. He is a member of Justice League.\n\nIn the tie-in comic for \"\", Black Canary names her and Oliver's son Connor. Doctor Fate brought both Black Canary and her son to a parallel universe following Green Arrow's death, where the former's counterpart has long died and its Oliver Queen has retired his role as Green Arrow and becomes a recluse. After meeting the Black Canary, the alternate Oliver decides to raise Connor as his son with the baby's mother. In \"Injustice 2\", Black Canary, Prime Earth Green Arrow, and Connor are revealed to have returned to Connor and Dinah's original universe after the fall of Superman's Regime after the Prime Earth Superman defeated his corrupted counterpart. Black Canary and Prime Earth Green Arrow assist Batman in fighting crime and rebuilding the world; the young Connor displays an excellent marksmanship like his late-father under Prime Earth Green Arrow's tutelage and having his mother's metahuman power.\n\n\nIn the game \"Injustice 2\", he and his parents go back to their original world so Black Canary and Green Arrow can assist Batman with Connor being taken care of by a babysitter while his parents are off fighting the Society and Brainiac's forces. In Black Canary's single player ending, she discovers that Connor has inherited her sonic scream, allowing him to fight off the Brainiac forces attacking him indicating he is a Metahuman like his mother. Connor also makes a cameo appearance in Harley Quinn's Ending, where he is shown in the background with his parents as Harley is spending time with her daughter Lucy (under the guise as Lucy's aunt as Lucy is unaware that Harley is her biological mother).\n"}

{"id": "1999035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999035", "title": "Damper (flow)", "text": "Damper (flow)\n\nA damper is a valve or plate that stops or regulates the flow of air inside a duct, chimney, VAV box, air handler, or other air-handling equipment. A damper may be used to cut off central air conditioning (heating or cooling) to an unused room, or to regulate it for room-by-room temperature and climate control. Its operation can be manual or automatic. Manual dampers are turned by a handle on the outside of a duct. Automatic dampers are used to regulate airflow constantly and are operated by electric or pneumatic motors, in turn controlled by a thermostat or building automation system. Automatic or motorized dampers may also be controlled by a solenoid, and the degree of air-flow calibrated, perhaps according to signals from the thermostat going to the actuator of the damper in order to modulate the flow of air-conditioned air in order to effect climate control.\n\nIn a chimney flue, a damper closes off the flue to keep the weather (and birds and other animals) out and warm or cool air in. This is usually done in the summer, but also sometimes in the winter between uses. In some cases, the damper may also be partly closed to help control the rate of combustion. The damper may be accessible only by reaching up into the fireplace by hand or with a woodpoker, or sometimes by a lever or knob that sticks down or out. On a wood-burning stove or similar device, it is usually a handle on the vent duct as in an air conditioning system. Forgetting to open a damper before beginning a fire can cause serious smoke damage to the interior of a home, if not a house fire.\n\nA zone damper (also known as a Volume Control Damper or VCD) is a specific type of damper used to control the flow of air in an HVAC heating or cooling system. In order to improve efficiency and occupant comfort, HVAC systems are commonly divided up into multiple zones. For example, in a house, the main floor may be served by one heating zone while the upstairs bedrooms are served by another. In this way, the heat can be directed principally to the main floor during the day and principally to the bedrooms at night, allowing the unoccupied areas to cool down.\n\nZone dampers as used in home HVAC systems are usually electrically powered. In large commercial installations, vacuum or compressed air may be used instead. In either case, the motor is usually connected to the damper via a mechanical coupling.\n\nFor electrical zone dampers, there are two principal designs.\n\nIn one design, the motor is often a small shaded-pole synchronous motor combined with a rotary switch that can disconnect the motor at either of the two stopping points (\"damper open\" or \"damper closed\"). In this way, applying power to the \"open damper\" terminal causes the motor to run until the damper is open while applying power at the \"close damper\" terminal causes the motor to run until the damper is closed. The motor is commonly powered from the same 24 volt AC power source that is used for the rest of the control system. This allows the zone dampers to be directly controlled by low-voltage thermostats and wired with low-voltage wiring. Because simultaneous closure of all dampers might harm the furnace or air handler, this style of damper is often designed to only obstruct a portion of the air duct, for example, 75%.\n\nAnother style of electrically powered damper uses a spring-return mechanism and a shaded-pole synchronous motor. In this case, the damper is normally opened by the force of the spring but can be closed by the force of the motor. Removal of electrical power re-opens the damper. This style of damper is advantageous because it is \"fail safe\"; if the control to the damper fails, the damper opens and allows air to flow. However, in most applications \"fail safe\" indicates the damper will close upon loss of power thus preventing the spread of smoke and fire to other areas. These dampers also may allow adjustment of the \"closed\" position so that they only obstruct, for example, 75% of the air flow when closed.\n\nFor vacuum-operated or pneumatically operated zone dampers, the thermostat usually switches the pressure or vacuum on or off, causing a spring-loaded rubber diaphragm to move and actuate the damper. As with the second style of electrical zone dampers, these dampers automatically return to the default position without the application of any power, and the default position is usually \"open\", allowing air to flow. Like the second style of electrical zone damper, these dampers may allow adjustment of the \"closed\" position.\n\nHighly sophisticated systems may use some form of building automation such as BACnet or LonWorks to control the zone dampers. The dampers may also support positions other than fully open or fully closed and are usually capable of reporting their current position and, often, the temperature and volume of the air flowing past the smart damper.\n\nRegardless of the style of damper employed, the systems are often designed so that when no thermostat is calling for air, all dampers in the system are opened. This allows air to continue to flow while the heat exchanger in a furnace cools down after a heating period completes.\n\nMultiple zones can be implemented using either multiple, individually controlled furnaces/air handlers or a single furnace/air handler and multiple zone dampers. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nAdvantages:\n\nDisadvantages:\nPneumatic actuation is preferred for these dampers. It is easier to provide zone-classified solenoid valves for pneumatic actuation, as compared to electrical actuation. The physical size of such solenoid valves have come down very considerably over the years.\n\nFire dampers are fitted where ductwork passes through fire compartment walls and fire curtains as part of a fire control strategy. In normal circumstances, these dampers are held open by means of fusible links. When subjected to heat, these links fracture and allow the damper to close under the influence of the integral closing spring. The links are attached to the damper such that the dampers can be released manually for testing purposes. The damper is provided with an access door in the adjacent ductworks for the purpose of inspection and resetting in the event of closure.\n\n"}

Baynes joined the Royal Navy in 1810 and served in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. He took part in the Battle of Navarino in 1827 during the Greek War of Independence. He was promoted to captain in 1828 and commanded the vessels HMS \"Andromache\" and HMS \"Bellerophon\" and served as one of the senior officers in the Baltic Sea during the Crimean War. In 1857, he was made Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station.\n\nBaynes was born to Commander Thomas Baynes of the British Royal Navy and Edith Denman in Millbrook, Hampshire. Baynes followed his father and joined the Royal Navy on 19 April 1810 at the age of 14 and was assigned to during the Napoleonic Wars. The ship patrolled off the coast of Catalonia where Baynes served as a midshipman until 1813. From 1813 to 1818, Baynes served in a succession of vessels; , , (flagship of Rear Admiral Alexander Cochrane) and in which Baynes took part in the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. This was followed by stints aboard and , flagship of Rear Admiral Robert Plampin. \n\nOn 8 April 1818, Baynes was promoted to lieutenant and on 12 April 1819, was assigned to . On 2 December 1822 he was assigned shore duty at St Helena before joining and HMS \"Tartarus\" on the South American station. On 6 October 1826, he was assigned to . On 8 July 1827, he was made the commanding officer of the sloop on the Mediterranean Station, but returned to \"Asia\" as second captain, which was the flagship of Vice Admiral Edward Codrington.\n\nBaynes was aboard \"Asia\", the British flagship during the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827 during the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire. A joint British-French-Russian fleet attacked a larger, joint Ottoman-Egyptian fleet in Navarino Bay. \"Asia\" led the line of battle and the steady fire by the British-French-Russian fleet led to their victory. Baynes distinguished himself during the battle and was promoted to captain on 8 July 1828. He was also made a companion of the Bath, a knight in the Greek Order of the Redeemer and received two other honours. \n\nAs a post-captain, Baynes was not given a command immediately was only assigned to command the 26-gun HMS \"Andromache\" on the Cape Station beginning 2 February 1838. He remained aboard the ship until March 1843, after which he was placed on half-pay. On 8 July 1846, he married Frances Denman, the daughter of Lord Denman, Lord Chief Justice. Baynes was reactivated and from 23 September 1847 to 7 November 1850, he commanded HMS \"Bellerophon\" a troopship that was assigned first to the Western Station, then the Mediterranean. Baynes was promoted to rear admiral on 7 February 1855 and he was the third in command in the Baltic Sea during the final year of the Crimean War in 1855.\n\nHe was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station in on 8 July 1857, with his flag aboard . Baynes arrived as the gold rush in the British Pacific Northwest was happening and the Royal Navy was expected to enforce the laws enacted by the Governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island, James Douglas. While Baynes was away at Callao, Peru, the San Juan border dispute erupted. On 27 July 1859, United States troops under the command of Brigadier-General William Selby Harney landed on San Juan Island off the Colony of Vancouver Island at the behest of 22 American settlers who claimed to be threatened. The settlers had killed a pig that belonged to the Hudson's Bay Company, and feared British punishment. San Juan Island was British territory, and though the British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lyons initially sought to conquer an American-held island that the British also laid claim to, he ordered Baynes to assist but not to escalate the issue. Douglas also sought military intervention, who demanded the landing of Royal Marines on the island. Baynes refused and his patient handling of the situation led to joint-occupation of the island until a formal decision could be made. In 1872, the British recognized American sovereignty over the island. \n\nAfter the gold rush and the San Juan dispute, Baynes sought to transfer the headquarters of the Pacific Station to the North Pacific. Esquimalt was Baynes' suggestion in 1859, to which the Admiralty agreed in 1862. On 18 April 1860 he was made a knight commander of the Bath. He remained Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station until 1861. He returned to the United Kingdom and never held command again, though he was promoted to vice-admiral of the blue on 5 August 1861. He was made vice admiral of the red in 1863 and admiral in 1865.\n\nBaynes Sound in British Columbia is named for him, and the town of Ganges on Saltspring Island and the waters offshore, Ganges Harbour, are named for his flagship, \"Ganges\". He died in Upper Norwood on 7 September 1869, and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.\n\n"}
{"id": "1999038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999038", "title": "Intermediate disturbance hypothesis", "text": "Intermediate disturbance hypothesis\n\nThe intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) suggests that local species diversity is maximized when ecological disturbance is neither too rare nor too frequent. At high levels of disturbance, due to frequent forest fires or human impacts like deforestation, all species are at risk of going extinct. According to IDH theory, at intermediate levels of disturbance, diversity is thus maximized because species that thrive at both early and late successional stages can coexist. IDH is a nonequilibrium model used to describe the relationship between disturbance and species diversity. IDH is based on the following premises: First, ecological disturbances have major effects on species richness within the area of disturbance. Second, interspecific competition results from one species driving a competitor to extinction and becoming dominant in the ecosystem. Third, moderate ecological scale disturbances prevent interspecific competition.\n\nDisturbances act to disrupt stable ecosystems and clear species' habitat. As a result, disturbances lead to species movement into the newly cleared area. Once an area is cleared there is a progressive increase in species richness and competition takes place again. Once disturbance is removed, species richness decreases as competitive exclusion increases. \"Gause's Law\", also known as competitive exclusion, explains how species that compete for the same resources cannot coexist in the same niche. Each species handles change from a disturbance differently; therefore, IDH can be described as both \"broad in description and rich in detail\". The broad IDH model can be broken down into smaller divisions which include spatial within-patch scales, spatial between-patch scales, and purely temporal models. Each subdivision within this theory generates similar explanations for the coexistence of species with habitat disturbance. Joseph H. Connell proposed that relatively low disturbance leads to decreased diversity and high disturbance causes an increase in species movement. These proposed relationships lead to the hypothesis that intermediate disturbance levels would be the optimal amount of disorder within an ecosystem. Once K-selected and r-selected species can live in the same region, species richness can reach its maximum. The main difference between both types of species is their growth and reproduction rate. These characteristics attribute to the species that thrive in habitats with higher and lower amounts of disturbance. K-selected species generally demonstrate more competitive traits. Their primary investment of resources is directed towards growth, causing them to dominate stable ecosystems over a long period of time; an example of K-selected species the African elephant, which is prone to extinction because of their long generation times and low reproductive rates. In contrast, r-selected species colonize open areas quickly and can dominate landscapes that have been recently cleared by disturbance. An ideal examples of r-selected groups are algae. Based on the contradictory characteristics of both of these examples, areas of occasional disturbance allow both r and K species to benefit by residing in the same area. The ecological effect on species relationships is therefore supported by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.\n\nDavid Wilkinson gives a thorough history of the hypothesis in his paper titled, \"The disturbing history of the intermediate disturbance\". In this paper, he explains that the idea of disturbance relating to species richness can be traced back to the 1940s in Eggeling 1947, Watt 1947, and Tansley 1949. Though studies supporting the hypothesis began in the 1960s, the first concrete statements of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis didn't occur until the 1970s. The hypothesis was initially illustrated using what has been referred to as a \"hump-backed model\", which graphed the proposed relationship between diversity and disturbance. This graph appeared first in Grime's 'Competitive exclusion in herbaceous vegetation' where it was used to show the relationship between species density and both environmental stress and intensity of management. The graph appears again in Horn's 'Markovian properties of forest succession' and Connell's 'The influence of interspecific competition and other factors on the distribution of the barnacle'. Though Grime was the first to provide a model for the relationship and Horn was the first to explicitly state the hypothesis, Connell is generally cited in text books and journals as the founder of the hypothesis.\n\nThe hypothesis caused concern among the marine science community because of the discrepancy with the 1976 Competition/Predation/Disturbance model proposed by Menge and Sutherland In this model, low disturbance influences high predation and high disturbance creates low predation, causing competitive exclusion to take place. Menge & Sutherland formulated a new model, one that incorporated Connell's ideas in a two part graph published in \"The American Naturalist\" (1987). This model proposes that predation, competition, and disturbance are all responsible for shaping the diversity of a community under certain circumstances.\n\nResearch regarding the effects of intermediate disturbance is ongoing. In one study, dry and tropical forest regions were compared to determine how the effects of IDH change due to varying climate. More recently, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been examined in marine and freshwater ecosystems and protist microcosms.\n\nDebates over the validity of the IDH are ongoing within the discipline of tropical ecology as the theory is tested in various ecological communities. Other evidence exists for and against the hypothesis. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been supported by several studies involving marine habitats such as coral reefs and macroalgal communities. In shallow coastal waters off of south-west Western Australia, a study was conducted to determine whether or not the extremely high diversity observed in macroalgal communities was due to disturbance from waves. Using a numerical wave model to estimate the forces caused by waves, researchers were able to determine that there was a significant relationship between species diversity and disturbance index; this is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Furthermore, diversity was lower at exposed offshore sites where disturbance from waves was highest, and at extremely sheltered site where disturbance from waves was minimized. The study provided evidence that biodiversity in microalgal reef communities possess some relationship with their proximity to the outer edge of lagoon systems typical of the Western Australian coast. While this study may have been localized to the Western Australian coast, it still provides some evidence to support the validity of the IDH.\n\nAdditionally, a study done in the Virgin Islands National Park found that species diversity, in some locations, of shallow coral reefs increased after infrequent hurricane disturbance. In 1982, reefs in Kona, Hawaii were reported to have an increase in diversity after a moderate storm, although the effects of the storm varied with the reef zones. In 1980, Hurricane Allen increased species diversity in shallow zones of the Discovery Bay Reef in Jamaica because the more dominant corals were reduced; giving the other types a chance to propagate following the disturbance. Similar findings have been reported in shallow reefs in which dominant species of coral have suffered more damage than the less common species. While more long-term studies are required to completely support the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, the studies that have been conducted thus far have proven that IDH does have some validity while attempting to describe the relationship between diversity and the rate of occurrences of disturbance in an area.\n\nEven though the IDH was designed for species-rich environments, like tropical rainforests, \"most studies that evaluate the IDH are based on limited data with: few species, a limited range of disturbance and/or only a small geographic area, compared with the scale of interest\". In this experiment, Rogers, Poorter, Hawthorne, and Sheil evaluate the IDH on a larger scale and compare different tropical forest types in Ghana. Their dataset consisted of 2504 one-hectare plots with a total of 331,567 trees. These plots were divided classified into three forest types: wet (446 plots), moist (1322 plots), and dry forest (736 plots). They found that diversity does peak at intermediate level of disturbance but little variation is explained outside dry forests. Therefore, disturbance is less important for species diversity patterns in wet tropical rain forests than previously thought. The number of species was about the same for each forest type, and wet forests had only slightly fewer pioneer species, slightly more shade-tolerant and an equal number of pioneer light-demanders compared with the moist and dry forests. Their results generally supported the IDH as an explanation of why diversity varies across sites, but concluded that disturbance is less important for species richness patterns in wet tropical rain forests than previously thought.\n\nIDH has been subject to criticism since its inception but not to the degree that other species density hypotheses have been. Recently there has been a call for a critical reassessment of IDH. Criticisms have focused on the increasing amount of empirical data that disagrees with IDH. This can be found within approximately 80% of over 100 reviewed studies that are examining the predicted peak of diversity in intermediate disturbance levels. The rationales behind these discrepancies have been leveled at the simplicity of IDH and its inability to grasp the complexity found within the spatial and intensity aspects of disturbance relationships. In addition, many IDH proven circumstances have been suggested to be a reflection of skewed research methods based on researchers looking for humped diversity-disturbance relations only in systems where they believed it has occurred. Other criticisms are suggesting several subtle theoretical issues with IDH. First, while disturbances weaken competition by reducing species densities and per-capita growth rates, it also reduces the strength of competition needed to push per capita growth into a negative territory and reduce density to zero. Second, intermediate disturbances slow competitive exclusion by increasing the long-term average mortality rate, and thereby reducing the differences in the average growth rates of competing species. The difference in the growth rates between competitively superior and inferior species determines the rates of competitive exclusion; therefore intermediate disturbances are affecting species' abundance but not coexistence. Third, intermediate disturbances temporarily affect relative species fitness. However, no matter what the rate of disturbance is, the species with favored fitness will out-compete the rest of the species.\n\nSeveral alternative hypotheses have been proposed. One example is by Denslow, who states that the species diversity in a disturbance-mediated coexistence between species is maximized by the presence of a disturbance regime resembling the historic processes. This is because species generally adapt to the level of disturbance in their ecosystem through evolution (whether disturbance is of high, intermediate or low level). Many species (e.g. ruderal plants and fire-adapted species) even depend on disturbance in ecosystems where it often occurs.\n\n"}
{"id": "1999046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999046", "title": "Vinclozolin", "text": "Vinclozolin\n\nVinclozolin (trade names Ronilan, Curalan, Vorlan, Touche) is a common dicarboximide fungicide used to control diseases, such as blights, rots and molds in vineyards, and on fruits and vegetables such as raspberries, lettuce, kiwi, snap beans, and onions. It is also used on turf on golf courses. Two common fungi that vinclozolin is used to protect crops against are \"Botrytis cinerea\" and \"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum\". First registered in 1981, vinclozolin is widely used but its overall application has declined. As a pesticide, vinclozolin is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). In addition to these restrictions within the United States, as of 2006 the use of this pesticide was banned in several countries, including Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.\nIt has gone through a series of tests and regulations in order to evaluate the risks and hazards to the environment and animals. Among the research, a main finding is that vinclozolin has been shown to be an endocrine disruptor with antiandrogenic effects.\n\nVinclozolin is manufactured by the chemical company BASF and has been registered for use in the United States since 1981. The following is a compilation of data indicating the national use of vinclozolin per crop (lbs AI/yr) in 1987: apricots, 124; cherries, 3,301; green beans, 13,437; lettuce, 24,779; nectarines, 1,449; onions, 829; peaches, 15,203; plums, 163; raspberries, 3,247; and strawberries, 41,006. In 1997, two applications totaling 285 pounds each, were applied to kiwifruit in California to prevent the gray mold and soft rot caused by Botrytis cinerea. In general, the United States has seen an overall decline in the national use of vinclozolin. In 1992, a total of approximately 135,000 pounds were used. However, in 1997 this number dropped to 122,000 and in 2002 it was down to 55,000 pounds.\n\nThe following chemical reactions are used to make vinclozolin: One method combines methyl vinyl ketone, sodium cyanide, 3,5-dichloroaniline, and phosgene. This process involves formation of the cyanohydrin, followed by hydrolysis of the nitrile. Vinclozolin is also prepared by the reaction of 3,5-dichlorophenyl isocyanate with an alkyl ester of 2-hydroxy-2-vinylpropionic acid. Ring closure is achieved at elevated temperature.\n\nVinclozolin is then formulated into a dry flowable or extruded granular. It can be applied by through the air (aerial), through irrigation systems (chemigation), or by ground equipment. Vinclozolin is also applied to some plants, such as decorative flowers, as a dip treatment where the plant is dipped into the fungicide solution and then dried. It is also common to spray a vinclozolin solution using thermal foggers in greenhouses.\n\nAll pesticides sold or distributed in the United States must be registered by U.S. EPA. Pesticides that were first registered before November 1, 1984, were reregistered so that they can be retested using the now more advanced methods. Because vinclozolin was released in 1981, it has gone through both preliminary and a subsequent reregistration.\nBelow is a list of the history of regulations for vinclozolin:\n\nThe U.S. EPA has examined dietary (food and water), non-dietary, and occupational exposure to vinclozolin or its metabolites. In general, fungicides have been shown to circulate through the water and air, and it possible for them to end up on untreated foods after application. Consumers alone cannot easily reduce their exposure because fungicides are not removed from produce that is washed with tap water. A key example of exposure to vinclozolin is through wine grapes which is considered to account for about 2% of total vinclozolin exposure. It has been determined that people may be exposed to residues of vinclozolin and its metabolites containing the 3,5-dichloroaniline moiety (3,5-DCA) through diet, and thus tolerance limits have been established for each crop. Although vinclozolin is not registered for use by homeowners, it is still possible for people to come into contact with the fungicide and its residues. For example, golfers playing on treated golf courses, and families playing on sod which has been previously treated may be at risk for exposure. Occupationally, workers can be exposed to vinclozolin while doing activities such as loading and mixing.\n\nAs part of the reregistration process, the U.S. EPA reviewed all toxicity studies on vinclozolin. The main effect induced by vinclozolin is related to its antiandrogenic activity and its ability to act as a competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor. Vinclozolin can mimic male hormones, like testosterone, and bind to androgen receptors, while not necessarily activating those receptors properly. There is evidence that vinclozolin itself binds weakly to the androgen receptor but that at least two of its metabolites are responsible for much of the antiandrogenic activity. When male rats were given low dose levels (>3 mg/kg/day) of vinclozolin, effects such as decreased prostate weight, weight reduction in sex organs, nipple development, and decreased ano-genital distance were noted. At higher dose levels, male sex organ weight decreased further, and sex organ malformations were seen, such as reduced penis size, the appearance of vaginal pouches and hypospadias. In the rat model, it has been shown that the antiandorgenic effects of vinclozolin are most prominent during the developmental stages. In utero, this sensitive period of fetal development occurs between gestation days 16-17. Embryonic exposure to vinclozolin can influence sexual differentiation, gonadal formation, and reproductive functions. In bird models, vinclozolin and its metabolites were shown in vitro and in vivo to inhibit androgen receptor binding and gene expression. Vinclozolin caused reduced egg laying, reduced fertility rate, and a reduction in successful hatches. Androgens also play a role in puberty, and it has been shown an antiandrogen like vinclozolin can delay pubertal maturation. Antiandrogenic toxins are also known to alter sexual differentiation and reproduction in the rabbit model. Male rabbits exposed to vinclozolin in utero or during infancy did not show a sexual interest in females or did not ejaculate. Since the androgen receptor is widely conserved across species lines, antiandrogenic effects would be expected in humans.\nIn vertebrates, vinclozolin also acts as a neuroendocrine disruptor, affecting behaviors tied to locomotion, cognition, and anxiety.\n\nIn rats, vinclozolin has been shown to affect other steroid hormone receptors, such as those of progesterone and estrogen. Just as with androgens, the timing of the exposure to vinclozolin determines the magnitude of the effects related to these hormones. In a study with rats, in vitro research showed the ability of two vinclozolin metabolites to bind to the progesterone receptor. However, the same study in vivo using adult male rats showed no effects. When mice experienced vinclozolin exposure in utero, male offspring exhibited up-regulated estrogen receptor and up-regulated progesterone receptor. In females, vinclozolin down-regulated expression of estrogen receptors and up-regulated progesterone receptor expression. This result causes virilization and the feminization of males and masculinization of females.\n\nIn rats, vinclozolin has been demonstrated to have trangenerational effects, meaning that not only is the initial animal affected, but effects are also seen in subsequent generations. One study demonstrated that vinclozolin impaired male fertility not only in the first generation that was exposed in utero, but in males born for three generations and beyond. Furthermore, when affected males with were mated with normal females, some of the offspring were sterile and some had reduced fertility. After three generations, male offspring continued to show low sperm count, prostate disease and high rates of testicular cell apoptosis., Other studies conducted experiments where rat embryos were exposed to vinclozolin during sex determination. F1 (first generation) vinclozolin treated males were bred with F1 vinclozolin treated females. This pattern continued for three generations. The initial F0 mother was the only subject that was directly exposed to doses of vinclozolin. F1-F4 generation males all showed an increase in the prevalence of tumors, prostate disease, kidney disease, test abnormalities and immune failures when compared to the control group. F1-F4 females also showed an increased incidence of tumors and kidney disease. Furthermore, transgenerationally transmitted changes in mate preference and anxiety behavior have also been observed in rats following exposure to vinclozolin. It has been reported that these transgenerational reports correlate with epigenetic changes, specifically, an alteration in DNA methylation in the male germ line. However, these transgenerational changes have not been successfully reproduced by BASF scientists, the manufacturer of vinclozolin \n\nThe U.S. EPA has classified vinclozolin as a possible human carcinogen. Vinclozolin induces an increase in leydig cell tumors in rats. The 3,5-DCA metabolite is thought to possess a mode of tumor induction based on its similarity to p-choroaniline.\n\nLaboratory test indicate that vinclozolin easily breaks down and dissipates in the environment with the help of microbes. Of its several metabolites 3,5-dichloroaniline resists further degradation. In terrestrial field dissipation studies conducted in various states, vinclozolin dissipated with a half-life between 34 and 94 days. Half-lives including residues can reach up to 1,000 days. Residues may accumulate and be available for future crop uptake.\n\nSince the phase-out of vinclozolin, farmers are faced with fewer options to control gray and white mold. The New York State Agricultural Experiment Station has carried out efficacy trials for gray and white mold. Research has showed potential alternatives to vinclozolin. Trifloxystrobin (Flint), iprodione (Rovral), and cyprodinil plus fludioxonil (Switch) control gray mold. Thiophanate-methyl (Topsin M) was as effective as vinclozolin in controlling white molds. Switch was the most promising alternative to vinclozolin for controlling both gray and white mold on pods and for increasing marketable yield.\n\n"}

In the middle of the second verse, Ron Isley goes down memory lane after saying \"The down low happened to me all over again\"; additionally, the third verse starts with Mr. Biggs asking R. Kelly \"What the hell is going on between the sheets in my own home?\", reprising their meeting in the Kelly Price song as well as the title of his own hit \"Between the Sheets\", and R. Kelly accuses Mr. Biggs (who recalls seeing him before) of mistaken identity. \n\n\"Contagious\" rose to number 19 on the pop singles chart and number 3 on the R&B singles chart and made the Isleys the first band to score a hit in six consecutive decades on Billboard's Hot 100.

The limits of \"Aryavarta\" extended over time, as reflected in the various sources, as the influence of the Brahmanical ideology spread eastwards in post-Vedic times.\n\nThe Baudhayana \"Dharmasutra\" (BDS) 1.1.2.10 (perhaps compiled in the 8th to 6th centuries BCE) declares that Āryāvarta is the land that lies west of Kālakavana, east of Adarsana, south of the Himalayas and north of the Vindhyas, but in BDS 1.1.2.11 Āryāvarta is confined to the doab of the Ganges-Yamuna. BDS 1.1.2.13-15 considers people from beyond this area as of mixed origin, and hence not worthy of emulation by the Aryans. Some sutras recommend expiatory acts for those who have crossed the boundaries of Aryavarta. Baudhayana \"Srautasutra\" recommends this for those who have crossed the boundaries of Aryavarta and ventured into far away places. \n\nThe \"Vasistha Dharma Sutra\" (oldest sutras ca. 500–300 BCE) I.8-9 and 12-13 locates the Āryāvarta to the east of the disappearance of the Sarasvati River in the desert, to the west of the Kālakavana, to the north of the Pariyatra Mountains and the Vindhya Range and to the south of the Himalayas.\n\nPatanjali's (mid 2nd century BCE) defines Āryāvarta like the \"Vasistha Dharmasutra\". According to Bronkhost, he \"situates it essentially in the Ganges plan, between the Thar desert in the west and the confluence of the rivers Ganges (Ganga) and Jumna (Yamuna) in the east.\"\n\nThe \"Manusmṛti\" (dated between 2nd cent. BCE to 3rd cent. CE) (2.22) gives the name to \"the tract between the Himalaya and the Vindhya ranges, from the Eastern Sea (Bay of Bengal) to the Western Sea (Arabian Sea)\". \n\nThe \"Manava Dharmasastra\" (ca.150-250 CE) gives \"aryavarta\" as stretching from the eastern to the western seas, reflecting the growing sphere of influence of the Brahmanical ideology.\n\nThe post-Vedic period of the Second Urbanisation saw a decline of Brahmanism. With the growth of cities, which treatened the income and patronage of the rural Brahmins; the rise of Buddhism; and the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great (327-325 BCE), the rise of the Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE), and the Saka invasions and rule of northwestern India (2nd c. BC - 4th c. CE), Brahmanism faced a grave threat to its existence. \n\nIn some later texts, Northwest-India (which earlier texts consider as part of \"Aryavarta\") is even seen as \"impure\", probably due to invasions. The Karnaparva 43.5-8 states that those who live on the Sindhu and the five rivers of the Punjab are impure and dharmabahya.\n\nThese texts also identify other parts of the Indian subcontinent with specific designations. The \"Manusmṛti\" mentions \"Brahmavarta\" as the region between the rivers Saraswati and Drishadwati in north-western India. The text defines the area as the place where the \"good\" people are born, with \"goodness\" being dependent on location rather than behaviour. The precise location and size of the region has been the subject of academic uncertainty. Some scholars, such as the archaeologists Bridget and Raymond Allchin, believe the term \"Brahmavarta\" to be synonymous with the Aryavarta region.\n\n\"Madhyadesa\" extended from the upper reaches of the Ganga and the Yamuna to the confluence of the two rivers at Prayaga, and was the region where, during the time of the Mahajanapadas, the Kurus and the Panchalas existed. The entire region is considered sacred in the Hindu mythology as gods and heroes mentioned in the two epics, the \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\", lived here.\n\nThe Gurjara-Pratihara king in the tenth century was titled the \"Maharajadhiraja of Aryavarta\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1999086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999086", "title": "Canadian airspace", "text": "Canadian airspace\n\nCanadian airspace is the region of airspace above the surface of the Earth that falls within a region roughly defined as either the Canadian land mass, the Canadian Arctic or the Canadian archipelago, as well as areas of the high seas.\nAirspace is managed by Transport Canada and detailed information regarding exact dimensions and classification is available in the \"Designated Airspace Handbook\" which is published every fifty-six days by Nav Canada.\n\nThe \"Canadian Domestic Airspace\" includes all of Canada and extends out over the Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic oceans. It is broadly divided into the \"Northern Domestic Airspace\" (NDA) and the \"Southern Domestic Airspace\" (SDA).\n\nThere are three main differences between the two areas, the most important of them being that the NDA is designated as a \"standard pressure\" region while the SDA is an \"altimeter setting\" region. This means that pilots operating in the SDA will calibrate their altimeters to atmospheric pressure according to information available at airports and through weather services. Conversely, in the NDA, pilots calibrate their altimeters to regardless of the actual atmospheric pressure. This is done because weather information is not available for all areas of the far north, so it is better that all pilots use a standard setting in order to avoid collisions.\n\nAnother major difference between the NDA and SDA is that magnetic declination is not used in the NDA. Because the magnetic north pole is in the NDA, magnetic declinations are very large; sometimes even 180°. This is further complicated by the fact that magnetic north moves approximately in an elliptical path every day. For these reasons, \"true\" tracks are always used in the NDA while magnetic tracks are frequently used in the SDA for convenience.\n\nThe final difference between the NDA and the SDA has to do with the location of Class A airspace in each region. This is explained in more detail below.\n\nCanadian Domestic Airspace is the second-largest air navigation service by volume of air traffic in the world, after the United States\n\nThere are seven classes of airspace in Canada, each designated by a letter (A through G).\n\n\nAirspace classes A through E are controlled. Class F can be controlled or uncontrolled. Class G is always uncontrolled.\nAirspace is managed by Transport Canada and detailed information regarding exact dimensions and classification is available in the \"Designated Airspace Handbook\" which is published every fifty-six days by NAV CANADA.\n\nSome control zones have unique procedures because of terrain or air traffic demands. These procedures are published in the Canada Flight Supplement. From the supplement \"Class E* All high level controlled airspace above FL600 within the SCA, NCA and ACA. Also, low level airways, low level fixed RNAV routes, CAEs, transition areas or CZs established without an operating control tower may be classified Class E airspace.\" So uncontrolled airports like Sarnia (CYZR) and others may appear to be miss-characterized as control zones since the Canadian Air Regulations (CARs) define a CZ as \"controlled airspace that is so specified in the Designated Airspace Handbook (DAH) and that extends upwards vertically from the surface of the earth up to and including 3,000 feet AGL, unless otherwise specified\" in that handbook. \n\nHowever, this apparent conflict is resolved since the DAH is specifically authorized to define airspace classification. The CARs definition of \"controlled airspace\" is \"...within which air traffic control service is provided;\". So when air traffic control is not provided it appears it should not be a control zone. The DAH defines Class G airspace as \"Airspace shall be classified G if it has not been designated A, B, C, D, E or F.\" There is actually no definition of \"uncontrolled airspace\" other than that, so by inferred definition CYZR is controlled airspace below 700 ft to 5 nmi beneath a Class G, transition airspace out to 15 nmi). The 700 ft is the base of this overlaying Class E transition airspace which is controlled up to FL125. DAH also defines \"Class B, C, D or E equivalent\" airspace but that specifically refers MTCAs which are military terminal control areas. \n\nBottom line is the CARs definition of CZ and controlled airspace specifically allows the DAH to further define certain \"Class E uncontrolled airports\" as a control zone as long as they have at least one navigation aid and an instrument approach procedure that originates in Class E transition controlled airspace. \n\nAnother important feature of Canadian airspace is the air defence identification zone (ADIZ) that surrounds North America.\n\nThe terminal control areas of the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon are located within Canadian airspace. They are as follows:\n"}

{"id": "1999093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999093", "title": "Jackson Plan", "text": "Jackson Plan\n\nThe Jackson Plan or Raffles Town Plan, an urban plan of 1822 titled \"Plan of the Town of Singapore\", is a proposed scheme for Singapore drawn up to maintain some order in the urban development of the fledgling but thriving colony founded just three years earlier. It was named after Lieutenant Philip Jackson, the colony's engineer and land surveyor tasked to oversee its physical development in accordance with the vision of Stamford Raffles for Singapore, hence it is also commonly called Raffles Town Plan. Raffles gave his instructions in November 1822, the plan was then drawn up in late 1822 or early 1823 and published in 1828. It is the earliest extant plan for the town of Singapore, but not an actual street map of Singapore as it existed in 1822 or 1827 since the plan is an idealised scheme of how Singapore may be organised that was not fully realised. Nevertheless, it served as a guide for the development of Singapore in its early days, and the effect of the general layout of the plan is still observable to this day.\n\nThe plan is currently on display in the Singapore History Gallery at the National Museum of Singapore.\n\nSir Stamford Raffles founded the colony in 1819, and before he left Singapore, he wrote to William Farquhar giving instructions on how the colony may be organised. Farquhar governed Singapore from 1819 until 1823, and with limited funds, he chose a pragmatic approach to allow the colony to flourish. Under the sheer volume of trade that passed through her port, some instructions were disregarded and the town grew haphazardly. Upon his final return to colony in October 1822, Raffles was displeased by the disorderliness of the town and that Farquhar had not followed closely the instructions he gave. For example, Farquhar allowed merchants to encroach on designated government area – he permitted the erection of houses and godowns on the Padang and on the nearby banks of the Singapore River, within an area Raffles specified not to be permanently appropriated by individuals. In response, Raffles formed a Town Committee, consisting of a merchant, Alexander Laurie Johnston; a civil servant George Bonham; and Captain Charles Edward Davis of the Bengal Native Infantry, who acted as president of the committee. They were assisted by Lieutenant Philip Jackson who drew up the layout plan of the city according to Raffles' instructions.\n\nRaffles issued his set of instructions to the committee on 4 November 1822, some of which are as follows:\n\n\nRaffles' instructions were incorporated into the plan, although not all of these were implemented. The committee consulted representatives from the Malay, Chinese, Bugis, Javanese, and Arab communities on the proposed resettlement of the population into their respective areas. The plan was drawn up some time in December 1822 or January 1823, and it was first published in an article by John Crawfurd as an engraving made in June 1828.\n\nThe plan is an idealised scheme of how Singapore may be arranged; the streets of the colony were laid out for the large part in a grid pattern, but taking into account the curves of the seashore and rivers as well as the topology of the hills. A map of 1825 shows that the actual layout of the town at that time was irregular to the south of the river, and the streets in grid pattern on the south side of the Singapore River (the Chinese kampong) shown in the Jackson Plan did not yet exist. The area west of South Bridge Road was still an undeveloped marshy land in a survey conducted by Coleman in 1829 and published in 1836, but had built up according to the maps of John Turnbull Thomson from 1846. The attempt to arrange the streets in a more regular pattern is also evident in the maps of 1836 and 1846.\nThe area west of the European Town to the Singapore river between the Fort Canning Hill and the sea was reserved for government use, and the area on the southeast of the river designated the commercial district. Although some European merchants had constructed buildings in the area designated for government and public use before the Jackson Plan was implemented, further such privately owned buildings were not permitted. Nevertheless, the rule was still ignored for a while, for example, the Old Parliament House was originally built as a private home, but was then later acquired by the colonial government. The area now has a high concentration of public and government buildings, including Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall, National Gallery, Asian Civilisations Museum, St Andrew's Cathedral, as well as the Parliament House (now The Arts House) and the Supreme Court of Singapore.\n\nThe south bank of the Singapore River however was marshy and would only have become suitable for commercial purposes after the marshy land was filled in and the river embanked. A small hill once existed between what is now Raffles Place and Battery Road; under the personal supervision of Raffles in 1823, the hill was levelled, and its soil used to fill and reclaim the marshy land just to the southwest of the River. The level of Battery Road was raised, and the river bank was embanked to become the Boat Quay and the Circular Road area. An open space with a garden in the middle was created, which became the Commercial Square, later renamed Raffles Place in Raffles' honour. This section remains the financial hub of Singapore today, and together with the European Town and the administrative area, evolved into the present-day Downtown Core.\n\nThe plan of Singapore divided the town into ethnic functional subdivisions. These ethnic residential areas were to be segregated into four areas.\n\nThe European Town had residents who consisted of European traders, Eurasians and rich Asians. An area south of the Singapore River was designated the Chinese \"Kampong\"; the Chinese area was originally further down the river, but was moved up the river to make way for the new commercial district, and this Chinese district evolved into the present-day Chinatown. The Indian area, called Chuliah Kampong, was located further up the river next to the Chinese zone (the Indians however would later also settle in another area north of the river now called Little India). Kampong Glam consisted of Muslims, ethnic Malays and Arabs who had migrated to Singapore, and was further divided into three parts, for the Bugis, the Arabs and an area for the Sultan.\n\nThe division however appeared not to be strictly enforced, as may be indicated by the presence of Nagore Durgha, Al-Abrar and Jamae mosques in the Chinese Kampong with the Chinese temple Thian Hock Keng located next to Nagore Durgha. A area marked \"Kling Chapel\" nearer to the Indian area was reserved for an Indian place of worship, although the Indian mosques and Sri Mariamman Temple were built within the Chinese zone. The concept of different ethnic zones would be abandoned, but the distinction of each district is still noticeable to the present day.\n\nIn addition to his proposal for the layout of the town of Singapore, Raffles also made recommendations on how the buildings may be constructed. Among many of Raffles' recommendations are that houses should be built with masonry and roof tiles to reduce fire risk. He also proposed that these buildings should have uniform and regular facades and that they should have a continuous sheltered public walkway at the front. This proposal produced the distinctive five foot ways of the local architecture of Singapore and Malaysia where by-laws were enacted requiring such walkways, and it also spread to other countries including parts of Thailand and the Philippines as well as Taiwan, Hong Kong and the port cities of southern China.\n\n"}

It is one of 10 high schools in the Minneapolis Public Schools district. Southwest offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.\n\nSouthwest High School was opened in 1940 with the main entrance at Beard Avenue South and West 47th Street. The school drew 841 students from Minneapolis, Edina and Richfield its first year. Two additions were made to the original structure, the first opening in 1956 and the second (Southwest Junior High) in 1968.\n\nWith the reorganization of Minneapolis schools in 1982, Southwest returned to just grades 9–12, with seventh and eighth graders going to Anwatin or Anthony Middle Schools. Most of the students who attended West High School were transferred to Southwest when it was closed the same year.\n\nIn 1987, the International Baccalaureate Programme began at Southwest. Currently, all 9th and 10th grade students follow the IB Middle Years Programme curriculum.\n\nAlso in 1987, Southwest High School was one of the first high schools in the country to stop using a Native American for its mascot and nickname. The Southwest student body voted to change the nickname of the school from the Indians to the Lakers.\n\nIn 2016, the Minneapolis school board approved a $47+ million renovation which would add a new building and let the school have space for 450 new students. The renovation was completed for the 2016-17 school year and added 20 new classrooms to the school building. The new 60,346 square foot building was constructed between the original east (Southwest Junior High building) and west buildings. As a part of the renovation, 12,400 square feet of the east building was demolished. The main offices of the school were moved to the new structure, and a large part of the 60,346 square foot building was the new 10,000 square foot lunch room. The renovation also included mechanical upgrades like air conditioning that classrooms in the school had never had before.\n\nThe demographic breakdown of the 1,757 students enrolled in 2015-2016 was:\n\n35.9% of the students were eligible for free or reduced cost lunch.

The disease is most prevalent in several rural areas of central Venezuela and is caused by Guanarito mammarenavirus (GTOV) which belongs to the Arenaviridae family. The short-tailed cane mouse (\"Zygodontomys brevicauda\") is the main host for GTOV which is spread mostly by inhalation of aerosolized droplets of saliva, respiratory secretions, urine, or blood from infected rodents. Person-to-person spread is possible, but uncommon.\n\nVHF has many similarities to Lassa fever and to the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers that occur in Argentina and Bolivia. It causes fever and malaise followed by hemorrhagic manifestations and convulsions. Some presentations of the virus are also characterized by vascular damage, bleeding diathesis, fever, and multiple organ involvement. Clinical diagnosis of VHF has proven to be difficult based on the nonspecific symptoms. The disease is fatal in 30% of cases and is endemic to Portuguesa state and Barinas state in Venezuela.\n\nTreatment and prevention for the VHF virus are limited and there are currently no licensed vaccines available that can act to prevent the disease. However, once infected, ribavirin, an anti-viral drug given intravenously, is one way to treat VHF.\n\nArenaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, bisegmented RNA viruses with antisense genomes. Based on their antigenic properties, arenaviruses have been classified into two major groups: the Old World arenaviruses, and the New World arenaviruses. Old World arenaviruses include lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Lassa virus. New world arena viruses are further broken down into three clades, A, B, and C. The Guanarito arena virus belongs to clade B and is the cause of VHF. On the biosafety level scale of one to four, with four causing the most risk, the viruses causing hemorrhagic fevers have been assigned a four by the CDC.\n\nThe short-tailed cane mouse, the main host of GTOV, is native to western Venezuela and resides in large numbers in tall grass, cultivated agricultural fields, human homes, and outbuildings. It is speculated that demographic and ecological changes in the rural areas increased the frequency of contact between humans and infected rodents such that VHF emerged.\n\nFrom September 1989 through December 2006, the State of Portuguesa recorded 618 cases of VHF. Nearly all of the cases were individuals who worked or lived in Guanarito during the time they became infected. The case fatality rate was 23.1%.\n\nBecause the virus is contracted by aerosol dissemination, concern arose shortly after the first cases emerged in 1989 due to fear of biological warfare. Potential biological terrorism agents were identified and categorized in 1999 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as part of the Congressional initiative to further response capabilities to biological weapons. Arenaviruses causing hemorrhagic fevers, along with a genus of virus called filoviruses, were categorized in Category A; these are pathogens with the highest potential impact on public health safety.\n\nA notable event in the timeline of this virus' scientific knowledge was the unexplained disappearance of a vial of the virus at the University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston National Laboratory, announced 2013 March 24.\n"}
{"id": "1999112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1999112", "title": "2 Enoch", "text": "2 Enoch\n\nThe Second Book of Enoch (abbreviated as 2 Enoch and also known as Slavonic Enoch, Slavic Enoch or Secrets of Enoch) is a pseudepigraphic text in the apocalyptic genre. It describes the ascent of the patriarch Enoch, ancestor of Noah, through ten heavens of an Earth-centered cosmos.\n\nThe cosmology of 2 Enoch corresponds closely with early medieval beliefs about the metaphysical structure of the universe and may have been influential in shaping them. The text was lost for several centuries, then recovered and published at the end of the nineteenth century. The full text is extant only in Church Slavonic, but Coptic fragments have been known since 2009. The Church Slavonic itself represents a translation from an earlier Greek version.\n\nSome scholars attribute 2 Enoch to an unidentified Jewish sect, while others regard it as the work of first-century Christians. Some consider it a later Christian work. It is not included in either the Jewish or the Christian canon.\n\n2 Enoch is distinct from the Book of Enoch, known as 1 Enoch, and there is also an unrelated 3 Enoch. The numbering of these texts has been applied by scholars to distinguish each from the others.\n\n2 Enoch has survived in more than twenty Old Bulgarian manuscripts and fragments dated from the 14th to 18th centuries CE. These Old Bulgarian materials did not circulate independently, but were included in collections that often rearranged, abbreviated, or expanded them. Typically, Jewish pseudepigraphical texts in Slavic milieux were transmitted as part of larger historiographical, moral, and liturgical codexes and compendiums, where ideologically marginal and mainstream materials were mixed with each other.\n\n2 Enoch exists in longer and shorter recensions. The first editors considered the longer version to be the original. Since 1921, Schmidt and many authors challenged this theory, and considered the shorter recension to be more ancient. Vaillant showed in 1952 that the additional parts found only in the longer version use more recent terms. Other scholars suggest that both of them preserve original material, and posit the existence of three or even four recensions.\n\nTwo different ways of numbering verses and chapters are used for 2 Enoch: the more widely accepted is Popov's of 73 chapters, while De Santos Otero proposed division into 24 chapters.\n\nThe best family of manuscripts are copies of the compilation of rearranged materials from Chapters 40–65 found in a 14th-century judicial codex titled \"The Just Balance\" (\"Merilo Pravednoe\"). The main manuscripts of the longer version are designated R, J, and P. The main manuscripts of the shorter version are designated U, B, V, and N. Several other manuscripts exist.\n\nMost scholars believe that the Old Bulgarian version was translated from one or more lost Greek versions, since the text attests to some traditions that make sense only in the Greek language, for example, a tradition found in 2 Enoch 30 that derives Adam’s name from the Greek designations of the four corners of the earth. The Semitisms, such as the words \"Ophanim\", \"Raqia Arabot\", and others, found in various parts of the text, point to the possibility of a Semitic original behind the Greek version.\n\nIn 2009, four fragments in Coptic from Chapters 36–42 were identified. They follow the short recension and are related to Manuscript U.\n\nDates ranging from the 1st century BCE to the 10th century CE have been proposed, with the late 1st century CE often preferred. The date of the text can be deduced solely on the basis of the internal evidence, since the book has survived only in the medieval manuscripts (even if a reference to 2 Enoch could be found in Origen's \"De Principis\" i, 3:3). 2 Enoch's composition must be later than that of the Book of the Watchers in 1 Enoch, around the 3rd century BCE. The crucial arguments for the early dating of the text have very largely been linked to the themes of the Temple in Jerusalem and its ongoing practices and customs. Scholarly efforts have been, in this respect, mostly directed toward finding hints that the Sanctuary was still standing when the original text was composed. Scholars note that the text gives no indication that the destruction of the Temple had already occurred at the time of the book's composition. Critical readers of the pseudepigraphic would have difficulty finding any explicit expression of feelings of sadness or mourning about the loss of the sanctuary.\n\nAffirmations of the value of animal sacrifice and Enoch's halakhic instructions, found in 2 Enoch 59, also appear to be fashioned not in the \"preservationist\", mishnaic-like style, but rather as if they reflected sacrificial practices that still existed when the author was writing his book. The author tries to legitimize the central place of worship, through reference to the place Ahuzan, which is a cryptic name for a Jewish temple.\n\nScholars have also previously noted in the text some indications of the ongoing practice of pilgrimage to the central place of worship. These indications could be expected in a text written in the Alexandrian Diaspora. In his instructions to the children, Enoch repeatedly encourages them to bring the gifts before the face of God for the remission of sins, a practice which appears to recall well-known sacrificial customs widespread in the Second Temple period. Further, the Old Bulgarian apocalypse also contains a direct command to visit the Temple three times a day, an inconsistency if the sanctuary had been already destroyed.\n\nThe Second Book of Enoch, also known as \"The Book of the Secrets of Enoch,\" is most noted for its description of multiple heavens and accounts of battles between angels and devils. This account is thought to have been known by and to have influenced the apostle Paul who described his experience of being taken up to the third heaven (2 Corinthians 12:2-4). Enoch describes the ten heavens this way:\n1. The first heaven is just above the firmament (Genesis 1:6-7) where the angels control atmospheric phenomena such as the storehouses of snow and rain and the waters above.\n2. In the second heaven, Enoch finds darkness: a prison where rebel angels are tortured.\n3. In the third heaven, he sees both paradise represented as the garden of eden (also guarded by angels) (as in 2 Corinthians 12:2) and hell where bad men are tortured.\n4. The fourth heaven is the place of the movements of the Sun and of the Moon, which are described in detail.\nThere is also on this level a heavenly choir comprising soldier angels whose singing is wonderful and marvelous.\n5. In the fifth heaven, Enoch finds some Grigori: soldiers of Satan that look like human beings but were giants. They were in a state of limbo, having not yet been condemned, and Enoch convinced them to repent.\n6. In the sixth heaven, he sees the angels in charge of governing the cosmos and people. These are the archangels who are above angels, measure all life in heaven and on earth, and the angels who are (appointed) over seasons and years, the angels who are over rivers and sea, and who are over the fruits of the earth, and the angels who are over every grass, giving food to all, to every living thing, and the angels who write all the souls of men, and all their deeds, and their lives before the Lord’s face.\n7. In the seventh heaven, Enoch, now guided by Gabriel, is allowed to enter and sees the Lord on his throne face to face but only from a distance. This is where the legions of God’s angels live in beautiful light.\n8. The Eighth heaven is just below the upper firmament in which are stuck the constellations; here lives Muzaloth, changer of the seasons and mover of the constellations.\n9. The ninth heaven is the upper firmament in which are fixed the constellations and the changer of the seasons.\n10 The tenth and final heaven is where God’s throne resides and God's face may be seen up close. Here he holds court.\n\nThe book can be divided into four sections:\n\nChapters 69-73 of 2 Enoch (sometimes referred as the \"Exaltation of Melchizedek\" or 2EM) outline the priestly succession of Enoch. There is not unanimous consensus whether this section belongs to the main body of the text or it is an early addition. Considering the not-fragmentary main manuscripts, 2EM is not included in P V N, it is included partially in J, while it is fully included in R U B, which anyway represent the best traditions of all versions. So we have both shorter and a longer versions of 2EM. Some early authors, as Charles, have not included this section mainly because they based their edition on manuscripts P and N. The lack of this section in recent manuscripts is explained by others because of the scandalous content (the virgin birth of Melchisedek) for Christian copyists. According to Vaillant, who edited the first critical edition of 2 Enoch, there is no evidence that 2EM ever existed separately. Modern editions usually include also these chapters.\n\nThe recent discoveries of Melchisedek 11Q13 text at Qumran and of a related text at Nag Hammadi, have made possible to have an idea about the Melchisedek controversy, involving also 2EM and the Letter to the Hebrews, that developed in non-mainstream Jewish communities and in early Christians communities from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE against the traditional Jewish identification of Melchisedek with Shem.\n\nA growing number of scholars recognize the antiquity of 2 Enoch, including also 2EM, and support a pre-70 CE dating for its original composition. Sacchi suggests that 2EM is actually an addition to the main body of the text (the style is slightly different), but a very early addition by someone of the same sect that wrote 2 Enoch (it uses the same language and same typical names as Ahuzan for Temple), dating 2EM after the 70 CE but before or about the Letter to the Hebrews. The differences between 2EM with the Letter to the Hebrews (in the Letter to the Hebrews, Melchisedek is primarily a heavenly figure, while 2EM depicts him as an earthly one) don't allow to prove the dependence of 2EM from Hebrews.\n\nThe theological universe of 2 Enoch is deeply rooted in the Enochic mold of the Jewish Apocalyptic literature of the Second Temple period. Yet along with appropriations of ancient traditions about the seventh antediluvian hero, the text attempts to reshape them by adding a new mystical dimension to the familiar apocalyptic imagery. The figure of Enoch portrayed in the various sections of 2 Enoch appears more elaborate than in the early Second Temple Enochic treatise of 1 Enoch. The anointing of Enoch, after he saw face to face the Lord, makes him be similar in appearance to a glorious angel and that allows him to sit above other angels on the left of the Lord.\n\nAccording to Orlov, in this attempt, one may find the origins of another image of Enoch, very different from the early Enochic literature, that was developed much later in rabbinic Merkabah and Hekhalot mysticism: the image of the supreme angel Metatron, \"the Prince of the Presence\", found in the later 3 Enoch. The titles of the patriarch found in the Old Bulgarian apocalypse appear to be different from those attested in early Enochic writings and demonstrate a close resemblance to the titles of Metatron as they appear in some Hekhalot sources. These developments demonstrate that 2 Enoch represents a bridge between the early apocalyptic Enochic accounts and the later mystical rabbinic and Hekhalot traditions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tuttle Company in 1994, and reprinted by Alva Press in 1999.\n\nThe work argues that what we recognize as traditional Chinese Ch’an/Japanese Zen Buddhism is in fact almost entirely grounded in Chinese Taoist philosophy, though this fact is well shrouded by the persistence of Mahayana Buddhist institutional trappings. Utilizing an array of scholarly commentary on the two traditions and historical deduction from what can be considered to be the best primary source material available, the author traces the development of Taoism and Buddhism in China and Japan for two millennia. \n\nThe story unfolds in China as Buddhism appears on the scene and is accepted by the Chinese population as a “simplified version of Taoism” that the Western barbarians (subcontinent Indians and Central Asians, e.g. Tibetans, et al.) could understand. They shared many philosophical similarities that made Chinese acclimation to Buddhism much easier – but the more dogmatic ways in which Buddhism was practiced helped it to get the fast track on becoming the predominant religion in China. \n\nIts predisposition to monastic institutionalization throughout the empire allowed it to eventually assimilate and co-opt Taoist perspectives. The dominance of the Ch’an Buddhist tradition was most responsible for this trend. However, when it was eventually exported to Japan, the Taoist strands had the opportunity in a new cultural framework to once again assert themselves. \n\nGrigg is able to trace the submergence and eventual resurgence of Taoism in Japan and the modern West by identifying how its specific tendencies (paradox, nonduality, aversion to institutionalization, emphasis on informal and varied paths to “enlightenment”, focus on the practical matters of influencing the social world, etc.) clearly manifested themselves in very different times and places. \n\nWhat he seeks to do in this book is vindicate the importance of Taoist thought in the Chinese religious history and displace the notion of Zen Buddhism as a coherent whole. To him, these are very different spiritual systems that only coexist today because of the almost wholly unacknowledged lingering of the original Buddhist colonization of Taoist China. The popularity of Zen today owes much more to its persistent Taoist origins than to Buddhist doctrine.\n\n"}

Dr. Cushing, who was descended from Matthew Cushing, an early settler of Hingham, Massachusetts, served as professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities, and established the family in Boston.\n\nThough she had two brothers, she and her two sisters became known in the social world as the \"Cushing Sisters\", heralded for their charm and beauty and schooled by their social-climbing mother to pursue husbands of wealth and prominence. All three Cushing sisters married into wealth and prominence: Her older sister, Mary \"Minnie\", married Vincent Astor, the heir of a $200 million fortune, in 1940, and her younger sister Barbara \"Babe\" was married to Standard Oil heir Stanley Mortimer, Jr., and later to CBS founder William S. Paley. Both of her sisters died of cancer within months of each other in 1978.\n\nShe established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950s on donated by Whitney. She was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Among her many public activities over the years were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.\n\nAfter her husband's death in 1982, she donated $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. acquired nine important American and French paintings, as well as $2 million for future acquisitions. She left $15 million to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in her own will.\n\nShe also made art auction history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene \"Bal au moulin de la Galette, Montmartre\". It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction. After her death, her art collection was sold at Sotheby's in 1999 for a then record $128.3 million, \"the second-highest single-owner auction in history.\"\n\nIn June 1930, she married James Roosevelt II (1907–1991), the eldest son of then Governor of New York, and eventual President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. After her father-in-law became President, she was reportedly FDR's favorite daughter-in-law, though she and Eleanor did not care for one another. Her husband served his father as an aide at the White House, and she often stood-in as hostess at the White House when Eleanor was absent. When FDR entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic at the Roosevelt estate in Hyde Park, New York in 1939, she was prominent at the affair, and accompanied FDR as he drove the King and Queen along the Hudson River.\n\nShe and James had two daughters:\n\n\nIn 1938, James left for Hollywood to work as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. she followed him, but they divorced in 1940. She was granted custody of their daughters, along with child support, though by biographers' accounts, James had little to no contact with his children, and eventually married three more times.\n\nOn March 1, 1942, she married millionaire John Hay \"Jock\" Whitney (1904–1982), who had been previously married to socialite Elizabeth Altemus. Whitney adopted both of her daughters. They moved to London in 1957, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower named Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Whitney was listed as one of the ten wealthiest men in the world.
