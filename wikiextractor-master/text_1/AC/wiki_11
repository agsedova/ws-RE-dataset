{"id": "2061361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061361", "title": "Augusta, Ontario", "text": "Augusta, Ontario\n\nAugusta Township is a township in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, located in eastern Ontario, Canada. Augusta is situated along the Saint Lawrence River, and extends back into rural hamlets. The township is located between the city of Brockville to the west, and the town of Prescott to the east.\n\nThe hamlets and villages within Augusta were established prior to the 1900s; primarily by the United Empire Loyalists. There are plenty of buildings and homes still standing in the township today that were built by early settlers; many of these historic homes are even still occupied by direct descendants of the first settlers.\n\nIn 2013, it was discovered that Samuel Bass, the Canadian abolitionist mentioned in Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir \"12 Years a Slave\", was from Augusta Township. According to early census records, Bass was born in Augusta in 1807; while here, he married Lydia Catlin Lane, with whom he fathered four children. His wife and children remained in the area, and some of his descendants still reside here to this day. Bass' grandparents were among the first Loyalists to settle in the area, and his parents are buried at Maynard.\n\nAugusta Township is located within the St. Lawrence Lowlands region; its southern-most boundary is the shoreline of the St. Lawrence River. Much of the area is situated on top of large layers of limestone and grey sandstone, which formed between 500—75 million years ago during the Paleozoic era and the Ordovician period. There is not much known about the period directly following the Ordovician period except that there were long periods of erosion followed by marine invasions. The last glaciation occurred around one million years ago which was responsible for many of the present-day landscape features. During this glaciation the entire area of what would become Augusta was covered in a sheet of ice around two to three miles in thickness. This ice sheet melted around 12,000 years ago as a result of climatic changes. A few thousand years after it melted the Ottawa—St. Lawrence Valley was flooded by an arm of the Atlantic Ocean to a depth of around ; geologists refer to this flooding as the Champlain Sea. The retreat of the Champlain Sea around 9,500 years ago left excessive stone surfaces in many areas. The bedrock and boulder clay in the eastern portion of the township are covered by beds of sand which are likely glacial-fluvial in origin; before the forest could take root many dunes were formed just north of the town of Prescott. The area has many pockets of clay and peat around the banks of the South Nation River and the South Kemptville Creek.\n\nThe township of Augusta is situated at the confluence of three distinct physiographic regions: the Glengarry till plain, the Smiths Falls limestone plain and the Edwardsburgh sand plain. The limestone plain accounts for around 50% of the townships total area. This area is level with a thin covering of soil, less than a foot in depth resulting in limestone outcroppings. The limestone plain supports a hardwood forest with the sugar maple being the most dominant species. Oak and pine are also common in this region as well as elm, ash, soft maple and cedar in the poorly drained areas. This land was not ideal for farming and has remained largely untouched; most of the plain is still covered in peat deposits and forest. The Edwardsburgh sand plain extends into the township from the east. The water table is generally situated close to the surface in this plain resulting in shallow bogs. Most of the area has been cleared, however elm, ash, beech, oak, and soft maple once grew in this region. Today, the area has been somewhat reforested with pine trees, such as in Limerick Forest. The front of the township is covered by the Glengarry till plain, which forms a drainage divide between the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa basins. This till can be described as loamy in texture and stoney. Well drained sections of the Glengarry till plain are suitable for grain crop production.\n\nThe soils along the Nation River contain mostly plant matter due to the poor drainage and are therefore of limited use. Another effect of the poor drainage in the region is the formation of large swamps which are common in the township and frequently drained. The soils in the entire township vary greatly due to the fact the township is situated within a variety of physiographical regions; the two most common soils in Augusta are Podzolic and Gleysolic. Podzolic soils are low in fertility and acidic while the Gleysolic soils are high in agricultural value.\n\nThe climate of Augusta Township is determined by its latitude, however it is influenced heavily by frontal systems which are the result of air masses coming out of the north and south. Westerly winds are the most prevalent wind system affecting the township. Augusta's climate can be described as humid continental with an average temperature range; ranges in temperature go from the average low of to the average high of . The total average amount of precipitation for the year in the township of Augusta is around annually. The climate has changed drastically since 1850. From 1550 until 1850 the area was in the grip of a minor ice age; average temperatures were much cooler and there was more precipitation. By 1885, a warming trend began which lasted until the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nThe township of Augusta was not fully settled until the late 1700s and into the early 1800s, when the Loyalists received their land grants throughout the area and began building homesteads. Most of the residents living in the township today are direct descendants of these Loyalists. Just prior to this in the mid-to-late 1700s, the French had occupied some of the land in the region, including Pointe au Baril in Maitland, Ontario. Before European settlement, many cultures of native individuals briefly occupied the entire region.\n\nThe earliest human activity around the region encompassing Augusta township according to archaeologists can be traced back to around 11,000 years ago. During this era, known as the Paleo-Indian period, retreating glaciers exposed inhabitable land for the first time. The cultures which are believed to have inhabited this region during this time are the Clovis people and the Plano people. These cultures left behind very little evidence of their existence; their impact on the area was relatively small as population density was very low. No human remains have survived from this time period meaning we cannot determine the Clovis or Plano's physical appearances. The largest piece of evidence to suggest that these cultures inhabited this region of Eastern Ontario are the numerous stone arrowheads and other weapons discovered in the region which can be attributed to these cultures and dated to the era. The Clovis arrowheads found near the township vary greatly in construction, reflecting centuries of progression and a rapidly changing environment. Earlier arrows were shorter while later Clovis arrows were longer and more spear-like; this is indicative of a mass migration of larger animals into the area.\n\nFrom 5000–1000 BC during the period known as the Archaic Period, the entire region of Eastern Ontario was dominated by the Laurentian Archaic people, who were direct descendants of the Plano culture. This culture was far more sophisticated than its ancestors due to the warmer climate and the emergence of modern flora and fauna; polished stone tools were used instead of chipped tools for both hunting and woodworking. Human remains from the Laurentian Archaic culture have survived, and according to archaeologists indicate the culture was both violent and ritualized. Some bodies found from this period were found to have skull fractures, stone projectiles embedded into the bones, or were found to have been decapitated. Other bodies were found to have been sprinkled with red ochre and buried with a wide range of goods seemingly to represent one's status within the culture. Some of the artefacts buried alongside the Laurentian Archaic people are not native to this region, meaning the Laurentian Archaic people must have traded goods with individuals outside of their own culture. It is presumed by archaeologists that the brutalized remains found alongside the ritualized burials are those of outside traders who may have threatened, attacked, or otherwise harmed the Laurentian Archaic people.\n\nAround 500 years ago, the area which would become Augusta Township was inhabited by an Iroquoian agricultural community with a population of around 1,600 individuals. The main habitation site is located near Indian Creek, slightly north of present-day Roebuck, Ontario. Archaeological excavations conducted at this site suggest that there were around 40 communal longhouses stretching around 100 feet in length within their village. The native Iroquoian farmers grew corn, beans, squash, sunflowers and tobacco. The village located at Roebuck is believed to be similar to Hochelaga, the native village situated in present-day Montreal which was visited by Jacques Cartier in 1535. When the European settlers arrived, the native populations began to decline steadily before all but disappearing from the township. There is some archaeological evidence to suggest survivors of European settlement were absorbed by the Hurons situated along the Trent River system.\n\nThe eighteenth century saw a period of French occupancy in what was to become Augusta Township. The township is conveniently situated along the St. Lawrence River, which was a common trade route at the time; in order to travel from present-day Montreal to Fort Frontenac (now Kingston) one would have to pass through present day Augusta. The French traded with the native populations at various trading posts along the St. Lawrence; valuable furs were exported back to France. The French eventually established a shipyard with the intention of building ships capable of navigating the rapids of the river. The shipyard was located at what the French referred to as Pointe au Baril, which is present day Maitland, Ontario, and had a sheltered bay ideal for their purposes as well as a thick forest of oak and pine that could be harvested for ship building. For protection against the British, the French also established a star-shaped fort at Pointe au Baril. Two ships were built at the French shipyard, \"Iroquoise\" and \"Outouaise\", both of which were constructed and launched around 1759. The following year, the French settlement as well as the ships were captured by General Amherst, and the French were forced to leave the settlement. After this, Pointe au Baril was left abandoned for two decades; no attempt was made to colonize the area and the workmen who lived within the fort were weary of both the natives and the British. Upon the arrival of the Loyalists, only one building remained from French occupation, a single log building which had once been the officers quarters. The building was converted into the township's first schoolhouse.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, residents of the American colonies were politically divided; many Americans were displeased with the British and striving for their independence from British rule. During this period of political unrest, those who sided with the British were viewed as traitors or rebels, and their opposition was met with violence. Individuals were forced to take sides, as even neutral parties were deemed rebels. Those who remained loyal to the crown were called Loyalists. During and after the war, the Loyalists were essentially pushed out of present-day America for their opposing views and left destitute with no where to go; they then turned to the British for relief. Initially, the Loyalists were hopeful that Britain would be able to successfully negotiate with the rebelling colonies, and that their land, homes, and possessions would be returned to them. No such negotiations ever occurred and with the end of the war military payouts were dwindling. New laws were passed in New York state which allowed the Loyalists' property to be officially seized, and threats were made on the lives of Loyalists who may try to return. The Loyalists had no other option but to rely on the British and return to present-day Augusta and the neighbouring townships.\n\nBritain's solution to the widespread poverty and homelessness was to provide the Loyalists with land grants which could be used to build new settlements and start over. These grants were also looked at as a reward for the men's loyalty to the crown. Originally, areas of Quebec were considered for division and distribution to the Loyalists; Quebec feared that the Loyalists would affect the area negatively, and could bring diseases such as measles into their community therefore the idea was abandoned. Major Samuel Holland, surveyor-general of Quebec was put in charge of surveying lands west of Quebec and assess their suitability for settlement. In 1783, Holland declared the land to be more than adequate for Loyalist settlements. The only remaining obstacle in the way of the Loyalists' land grants was the native population of Augusta; Britain would have to consider their land ownership when dividing the land. A man named Sir John Johnson was instructed to inquire as to which lands belonged to the native communities, and to purchase any land that they claimed as theirs. Captain Justus Sherwood, who remained in the area, was employed to provide a detailed survey of Augusta and the surrounding townships.\n\nBy 1784, the Loyalists were becoming increasingly restless and began to petition the government for relief from their dire situation; they were scheduled to be settled for the Spring of 1784. The long waiting period to be settled was due in part to the fact the government knew they would need to provide the Loyalists with some tools and supplies in order for them to sustain themselves. The government intended to provide each settler with some seeds and livestock to begin farming, as well as a few essential tools such as axes, knives and hoes. Carpentry and blacksmithing tools were also to be distributed to be shared amongst groups of settlers. The land grants were to be granted based on military position and rank.\n\nBy the spring of 1784, supplies had been gathered and the land had been surveyed in detail and divided into lots to be drawn for. Batteaux and provisions were ready to be transported along with the Loyalist settlers to the new settlements. The area surrounding present-day Augusta Township was divided into two ranges of townships, the first of which being called the Royal Townships. There are seven Royal Townships, Augusta being the seventh and titled Royal Township Number Seven. Eventually, the townships were named, Augusta being named Princess Augusta after the third daughter of King George III. It was said that she was \"not particularly thrilled\" by the idea of this township, which was mostly empty wilderness, being named after her. In June 1784, the Loyalists finally embarked from Quebec down the St. Lawrence River to their new settlements; Edward Jessup's Corps were to be the first settlers of the new Royal Township.\n\nThe earliest known school established in Augusta was the Johnstown Grammar School which stood in Maitland. It was a simple log-structure, built around 1788, and was probably the only school in the area at that time. Even into the 19th century, the farming families in the predominantly rural township saw little value in formal education. A child's primary responsibilities involved their family and farm, therefore the few pupils enrolled in the few schools that existed at the time attended sporadically, as their responsibilities allowed. Aside from the general apathy surrounding schools at the time, financial restrictions also hindered the establishment of a formal education system; even when a primitive schoolhouse managed to be built, there was little or no money for teachers' salaries or the appropriate texts and classroom instruments. These early schoolhouses were simple, log structures, built by volunteer farm labourers and made mostly with what they could find for free; these structures lacked basic necessities, such as toilets and floors, and often had holes which were patched with moss and dirt.\n\nIn 1816, The Common Schools Act came into effect in Upper Canada; this Act called for the distribution £25 grants to pay each teacher's wages, and for the township to be divided into school sections. The sections were to be determined based upon the locations in which approximately 20 pupils could easily congregate. Although the Act provided some improvement for the area, there was no financial aid for building materials or classroom materials thus the grants provided little encouragement for the settlers to establish schools. It was not until the mid-1800s that substantial progress was made in regards to education in Augusta Township. By 1844, the township had been successfully divided into 22 school sections, as well as 5 part-sections, which were union sections with neighbouring townships with pupils from multiple townships. The original sections and schools were as follows:\n\n\n\n\nEach section had its own schoolhouse, usually made from locally quarried stone and built by the local families. These one-room schoolhouses were used in the area until around the 1950s when the one-room separate schools and school sections were largely phased out. Many of the old schoolhouses still stand and have since been converted into private residences. S.S. #22, #29, and #32 were planned sections which never developed; it is unclear why there are no school sections 26–28. S.S. #16 was an apparently unnamed section located on Merwin Lane. This school was built of log and was open until 1872 when it was amalgamated with Brundage's School; ruins of this log structure existed into the early 1900s. S.S. #19 Pepper's School was a small section between North Augusta and Garretton with almost no records of its existence other than its appearance on Walling's 1861 maps. S.S. #15 Brown's School was the separate school for the community of Throoptown but few records exist regarding this school aside from a few payment records mad out to it; additionally, there was a Roman Catholic separate school located in Throoptown.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 60s as transportation improved larger public schools were built in centralized locations to amalgamate the pupils from the smaller schools. These larger schools were far more modern than the previous schoolhouses; during this period a handful of these larger schools were built in the township, only one of which is still in operation. In 1955, Churchill Public School opened at the southern end of Merwin Lane in what is now considered the community of Riverview Heights. It was a large brick building with steel framework and contained four classrooms; later a gymnasium and kitchen were added onto the school. This school amalgamated the Blue Church school, Haley's school and the old Maitland school house, all of which were shut down upon its completion. The school closed its doors permanently in 1974. Algonquin Public School was a brick structure located within the village of Algonquin, Ontario. It was the first school in the township to have a gymnasium included in the original plans. The school contained six classrooms and had an average enrolment of 130 pupils. The Algonquin Public School amalgamated Herron's school, Read's school, and the schoolhouses for the communities of Lord's Mills and Algonquin resulting in their closure. Algonquin Public School ceased operations in the 2000s and the building is currently being used as a retirement facility. Maitland Public School was located just west of Maitland Road in Maitland, Ontario. This public school was erected around 1955 and closed in recent history. The building has since been demolished. Maynard Public School was erected in 1958 and is the only public school within the township which is still in operation. Originally, the school contained only six rooms plus a principal's office and a board room before additions were added to the school in 1964, 1967 and 1969 in order to create more classrooms.\n\nFormerly, one private school was once located within the township of Augusta, Grenville Christian College. Located along Ontario Highway 2, the school was first known as St. Mary's Redemptorist College when it first opened in 1920; the original structure took to years to build with construction beginning in 1918. By 1973 The school was sold and became a co-ed private day or boarding school. The school closed in 2007 due to unspecified financial troubles; since its closure, much controversy has surrounded the school. Many students have come forward with allegations of abuse from former staff members.\n\nPresent day, only one elementary school exists within the boundaries of Augusta township: Maynard Public School located within Maynard, Ontario. Elementary students can either attend school in Maynard or be transported to Prescott or Brockville to attend the elementary schools there. There are no secondary schools within the township; however, secondary schools located in Prescott and Brockville service students living in Augusta Township.\n\nIn 2011, 51.8% of the 5,365 adults over 25 years of age living in Augusta had completed some form of post-secondary education. Of these individuals: 16.9% had obtained a university degree or certificate, 29.4% had obtained college diploma and 11.8% had obtained a trades certificate. A total of 26.1% of adults had achieved a high school education as their highest level of education, and an additional 15.8% of adults had completed neither their secondary nor post-secondary education. The most common field of study amongst adults in the township is health-related professions.\n\nThe township comprises the communities of Algonquin, Bisseltown, Blue Church, Centre Augusta, Charleville, Domville, Garretton, Glenmore, Herron's Corners, Limerick Forest, Lords Mills, Maitland, Maynard, McLeanville, McRobert's Corner, North Augusta, Perrin's Corners, Riverview Heights, Roebuck, South Augusta, South Branch, Sparkle City, Stone's Corners and Throoptown. Prior to 1834, Prescott was considered a part of Augusta Township; the town became a police village in that year and severed its ties with Augusta. By 1849, Prescott officially became a separated town with its own mayor and council, which it remains today.\n\nAlgonquin is a small rural hamlet located north of Maitland. Its centre location is the intersection of Algonquin Road and County Road 15, however the area which is considered the community Algonquin stretches from the fourth to the seventh concessions. In the early 1800s, the village was referred to as Wright's Corners after the Wright family, who owned the majority of the land there at the time after receiving it as grants. The Wright's were a wealthy loyalist family, who were prolific within the community; they ran an inn, and were noted to have paid the teachers in Augusta their salaries, as well as workers from the Algonquin cheese factory. By the 1860s the hamlet was formally listed as Algonquin, according to post office records.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1800s, a military route was surveyed from Maitland to the Rideau water-way. This resulted in more traffic passing through the area of Algonquin, and allowed the village to prosper. Around this time an inn was established by the Wright family to accommodate overnight guests who were travelling by stagecoach. Mail was delivered three times a week from Maitland at this time. By the middle of the century many businesses had opened in Algonquin to accompany the inn. A grocery store, blacksmith, cooperage shop, butcher, wagon making business and a Methodist church are among those listed as being in operation at this time. Additionally, the community opened its own post office around this time. Late into the 1800s Algonquin was at its most prosperous time; cheese factories and sawmills were in full operation as well as the local businesses.\n\nLike every other community, Algonquin had its own one-room schoolhouse referred to as S.S #11 Algonquin School. The first record of the school indicated it was a log structure along the fifth concession. This first school was later used as a machine shed by a local man before being burned for charcoal. The second schoolhouse was erected in 1833 and is still standing today. This newer schoolhouse was built from stone and the belfry was constructed in the community by a local and paid for by the pupils at the time. This school remained in operation until the opening of Algonquin Public School in September 1962. The one-room school then became obsolete, except to alleviate overcrowding from the larger, newer public school. Algonquin Public School remained in operation until recently. Students from the area are now transported to neighbouring towns for both elementary and secondary schooling.\n\nAlgonquin had at one point three churches to serve its community, the most recent one being Union Grove church. The church was a Wesleyan Methodist church and was built in 1892 along the fifth concession on Lot 25. An early parsonage was located on the same lot; trustees from the Wesleyan Methodist church purchased the five-acre lot in 1841 for one hundred pounds for this intention and held on to the property until 1858. The land was purchased again by trustees on October 31, 1892, for $1 from a Wm. Hornibrook. Shortly after the frame church was erected. Services ran every Tuesday night at this church until its closure in 1925. The structure was later purchased by a local resident who relocated the church across the road from its original location in 1943. The church remains in that location and has since been converted into a private dwelling. The earliest church built in Algonquin was a Baptist church located at the junction of Bisselltown and Maitland roads. The church was built in 1849 according to the date-stone located on its south wall. The church had stained glass windows and a balcony on the inside, originally there was a square tower at the front of the structure with a tall spire. Today, the church has been covered in white stucco and the spire and tower have been removed. The front of the building now has a large garage door as it was used for a brief period in later years as a car garage. The church has previously been used by the township on occasion to store maintenance equipment and is still standing today. The third church standing within Algonquin, Ontario, is the Algonquin United Church. which was built in 1858 according to its date-stone. In 1851 the first talks of building a church began and five years later the land was purchased to begin construction. Upon its construction, it was first referred to as Wright's Corners Church and later Maple Grove Church before becoming Algonquin United Church in the 1880s. The church is a stone building with Gothic style stained glass windows which were apparently a later addition. Algonquin United Church is still in use today.\n\nBisselltown Ontario, is a small community located along Bisselltown Road within Augusta Township. The village was established in 1785 when land was divided amongst the Loyalists; one of them, named David Bissell, and his eleven children settled the area after receiving the land through a land grant. The small community which grew around their homestead became known as Bisselltown. There is little information about what businesses may have existed in Bisselltown during the eighteenth and nineteenth century; due to its proximity to Algonquin it is possible residents simply travelled for services. According to a nineteenth-century map of the area, Bisselltown had an ashery, and a cheese factory was in operation here until 1891 when the building was moved to South Augusta. Bisselltown had its own cemetery located north of the community on Algonquin Road; many members of the Bissell family are buried there.\n\nThe community of Bisselltown had a schoolhouse which served as a union school for pupils from both Augusta and the neighbouring township of Elizabethtown. According to a Walling's map from 1861, this log schoolhouse was located on the township border along what is now Algonquin Road. In Augusta, the school was known as S.S. #31 McKinley's School. In 1877, the log structure was replaced by a one-storey red brick building. By 1958, the school had closed due to lack of enrolment and the opening of Algonquin Public School. The building was converted into a private residence before it was destroyed by a fire. The date stone for the school survived and is located in the local historical society's archives.\n\nBlue Church, Ontario is the name given to the community which surrounds The Blue Church, located at the corner of Blue Church Road and Ontario Highway 2 in Augusta Township. Upon the settlers first arrival in the late 1700s, the area of Blue Church was covered in a large stand of white pine trees. These trees were immediately harvested to be built into ships. In the late 1700s, the site of the Blue Church was already being used as a burial ground. Around 1784, Captain Justus Sherwood created a plan for a new town to be erected on the newly cleared land surrounding the burial ground; the town was to be called New Oswegatchie. In 1790, Augusta and its neighbouring townships decided to erect a church alongside the burial grounds which became known as the Blue Church.\n\nThe town of New Oswegatchie never materialized, however a small community grew around the church as many settlers built homes surrounding the church and cemetery; the community became known as simply Blue Church. Eventually the town was large enough to support its own post office as well as a small grocery store. The small community consisted of mostly small stone family houses and few businesses; many homes which were once a part of the community of Blue Church were demolished by DuPont Canada. One notable home which was demolished was a large stone house along Ontario Highway 2 just west of the Blue Church which was known as Barbara Heck House. This home was thought by locals and the church to be the house in which she died. Despite protests against its demolition, neither the church or the township had evidence to say she actually died in the house or that the house was historically significant, nor did they have the funding to restore the house. Barbara Heck house was taken apart stone by stone and placed into a barn in the hopes it could later be reassembled. In 1976 a fire broke out in the barn which destroyed the materials beyond repair.\n\nBlue Church was large enough to accommodate its own schoolhouse in the mid 1800s, referred to as S.S. #1 Blue Church School. The first schoolhouse built for the section was located around half a kilometre east of the intersection of Blue Church Road and Ontario Highway 2 and was built of stone. In 1874, a new brick structure was constructed to become the new S.S. #1, located at the corner of Blue Church Road and Ontario Highway 2 directly across from the Blue Church. Due to the school's proximity to the notable burial grounds, the school received many notable visitors including Lord Byng of Vimy. The school closed in 1955, as a newer, modern school opened in Maitland and school sections were phased out. The brick structure still stands and has been converted into a private residence.\nOn January 1, 1790, the townships of Augusta, Edwardsburgh, and Elizabethtown held a public meeting during which a decision was made to erect a church next to the burial ground at the proposed town of New Oswegatchie. Ten men from the townships were named trustees and required to raise the money to erect a church measuring sixty-two feet by fifty feet by January 1 of the following year. Years later, however, there was still little to no money raised to build a church of this size. It is unclear when exactly the first church was erected at this site; the most conclusive piece of evidence comes from an article from 1870 in a paper called \"The Church Herald\" which stated \"…there was erected somewhere about 1809 a frame church, named for the colour it was painted, the Blue Church.\" This year is presumed accurate as historical records for the community show that a year prior, in 1808, church services were being held out of a local's home and a year after, in 1810, historical records reference a church in the community. Additionally, a paper authored by John Dumbrille in 1888 titled \"A Short Sketch of the History of the Church of England in the Township of Augusta\" also named 1809 as the year the church was erected. The church is believed to have been painted blue very soon after being built, as the first reference made to the church being blue was in 1822 during a council meeting.\n\nIn the 1830s, church records indicate the Blue Church was in disrepair and services seem to have ceased for a period of time. In 1840, the original Blue Church was severely damaged by a fire and then demolished. For five years the lot remained empty until 1845 when a new church was built in its place. The church was built using some of the salvageable materials from the demolished church; during renovations in the 1960s charred timbers were found being used as studs in the newer building's walls. According to the 1851 census, the new blue church was a small frame building capable of holding around 300 people. The primary usage of the new church was to be a mortuary chapel. On April 20, 1903, the Blue Church caught fire a second time, however locals managed to put out the fire before too much damage was caused. The interior of the church was completely unharmed, but the stained glass was damaged in an attempt to salvage church pews and tame the fire, and the front of the building was visibly fire damaged. Present day, the church still stands in the same spot with the burial ground adjacent. The church is still sometimes used for memorial services.\n\nThe burial ground at Blue Church is considered historically significant, as many prominent settlers are buried here. The cemetery has been in use since the late 1700s, and was consecrated in 1832; the earliest recorded stone in this cemetery is that of a man named Alpheus Jones who died on April 13, 1793. The Methodist Church of Canada purchased a small area of the burial ground where Barbara Heck, founder of Methodism in Upper Canada, is buried. In June 1909 the Methodist Church erected a large monument at her place of rest in memorial.\n\nCentre Augusta, Ontario is a community located between Charleville and Algonquin, Ontario; as with most settlements from this time there are no definite boundaries. According to historical records such as Lovell's Ontario Gazetteer and Directory, the settlement was once fairly thriving; in 1869 at its height, the population was listed as 200 individuals. Centre Augusta established its own post office by 1854. Walling's maps from the 1860s indicate there were many taverns in Centre Augusta, as well as a sawmill and a pot ashery. By the end of the century, the population had declined to 100 individuals however many businesses were still established within the community. According to the Dominion of Canada's business directories there was a blacksmith, a flour mill, a cheese factory, a shingle factory, two saw mills and a grocer; the post office also remained open.\n\nThe village of Charleville, Ontario is located north of Maynard, Ontario along Charleville Road. The name Charleville was inspired by a man named Charles Lane, who was a prominent figure within the community involved in many business affairs. Originally, the settlement was referred to as Sebastopol, which was probably a reference to the Crimean War which was being fought around the time of settlement. The South Nation River bisects the village, which made it an ideal place for erecting early sawmills. Charleville was at one point the home of Canadian abolitionist Samuel Bass and his wife Lydia. At its height in the mid-nineteenth century, Charleville had a population of around 200 people.\n\nMost of the residents living in Charleville during the 1800s earned an income through agriculture, and like the other local communities found hops to be the most profitable crop. According to business directories from this period there were also many small, family owned businesses located within Charleville. At one point, the village contained numerous blacksmiths, wagon makers, dress makers and masons; the area also once had its own slaughterhouse and butcher as well as a cheese factory and general store. By 1853, the community had its own post office established on April 1 of that year; the first postmaster in the area was the community's namesake, Charles Lane.\n\nThe Charleville Cheese Factory was constructed in 1881 and was located at the northeast corner of Charleville Road and the Fourth Concession. The building was constructed by a local resident named Rufus Earl who made the first batch of cheese there on May 1, 1881. The factory was set up for the cheesemaker to live on site. From 1881 until the end of the 1920s, the factory had changed hands many times. By the 1930s, the factory was producing both butter and cheese for the local market, however competition and a waning market lead to the factory's closure shortly after. After its closure, the building was sold and later demolished, however the boiler building was salvaged and turned into a private dwelling before it burned to the ground. The spot in which the factory once stood is now the location of a modern home.\n\nIn the mid 1800s, residents around the Charleville community petitioned the township council to build their own schoolhouse and become their own school section; eventually, two schools were built which served pupils from Charleville: S.S. #9 Throop's School and S.S. #12 Perrin's School, located in nearby Perrin's Corners. This school was located on the corner of Charleville Road and the Fourth Concession on land purchased from the Throop family, who the school was named after. The first school was built sometime in the early-to-mid 1800s and was replaced in 1876 by a stone structure. By 1958 the building had fallen into disrepair, and was condemned from use. Students were relocated to Maynard Public School. For a period the dilapidated building was used as storage until the back wall completely caved in. The ruins of the schoolhouse remained on site until 1973 when the building was purchased, demolished and replaced with a brick bungalow; no trace of it exists today.\n\nDomville, Ontario is a small hamlet located around four miles north of the town of Prescott, along County Road 18. The name Domville was first used around the 1870s; prior to this, the community was first referred to as either Henry's Corners or Fell's Corners. Upon the post office being established, residents asked council to come up with a more palatable name for their hamlet; a Royalist named John Dumbrille put forth the name Frogmore, in reference to Frogmore house. This proposed name change offended the residents, who thought Dumbrille had selected the name in regards to the hamlet's proximity to a large swamp. Around 1876, there was still much dispute over the name of the hamlet; church records from that year referred to the hamlet at Nelsonville. Ultimately, the residents chose Dumbrille's second choice, Domville, which was the original spelling of his surname.\n\nThe first families to settle in the area were the Fell family and the Henry family, where the name's Fell's Corners and Henry's Corners originate. A small cemetery located within the hamlet contains at least one member of the Fell family, and is dated back as far as 1814; before the Maynard cemetery was erected. By the mid-to-late 19th century, Domville's population was listed as 125 persons; according to census records and newspapers from the time, the hamlet boasted many businesses and successful farmers. By 1885, the community had its own post office established, as well as two general stores, a blacksmith and carriage shop, two churches and a grist mill. Domville was also home to a fairly large cheese factory, which reportedly used the around milk of 600 cows daily to produce their cheese. By the 1890s, more small businesses emerged, including a saw mill, butcher, and shoemaker. Many farmers were successful in growing and selling hops commercially, to nearby breweries. By the 1970s, the post office, cheese factory, and school had all ceased operations. The swamp in Domville was gradually drained, and new homes were built where it once was.\n\nIn 1875 a stone schoolhouse was built on donated land, which opened the following year; the school was called S.S. #8 Domville School. This one-room school was built between the fourth and fifth concessions along McCully road, approximately 1,300 feet from where an earlier school once stood; the previous school was a primitive, poorly built structure which had essentially begun to collapse and been deemed unsafe. The new, stone structure was built on donated land complete with a stone porch, as well as a woodshed on site; into the 20th century, the school was equipped with new hardwood floors, a wood-burning stove, and a fenced-in playground for the students. During the 1960s the school periodically closed due to lack of enrolment and would re-open as needed to deal with the overflow from Maynard Public School. By the end of the decade, the school had permanently closed and was left abandoned.\n\nThe village of Domville at one time had two churches, the Domville United Church and Knapp's Church. Knapp's Church was dedicated on December 22, 1876 and was located on the east side of McCully Road. Little is known about the church other than anecdotal stories from settlers diaries regarding church services and lectures. The land for this church was originally purchased for $5. The church was closed on an unknown date and demolished shortly after. the Domville United Church was constructed in 1876 on the corner of the Fourth Concession and County Road 18. The church is a light brown brick structure with Gothic style windows. At a later time, a recreation hall was attached to the back of the church for Sunday school services and church dinners. In the early 1970s this church closed for a period of time as it was not financially feasible for it to remain open; by 1973 it was purchased by a Greek Orthodox Bishop who converted the church into a Greek Orthodox church. The bishop intended on turning the building into living quarters for nuns, however the building did not meet the township's requirements to be used for this purpose. The church is still standing however it is rarely used.\n\nGarretton, Ontario is a small hamlet located approximately seven miles east of the North Augusta along County Road 18; Garretton is situated within the Rideau River watershed, with the south branch of the Rideau running through the centre of the community. When the land was first settled in the area settlers immediately set up farms along the banks of the river, in between the ninth and tenth concessions; whereas in most other nearby hamlets, lots were placed along the concession lines. The name Garretton came from one of the first settler's, Joseph Garrett, who headed one of the first families to establish themselves along the river there around 1830; his son Nathaniel Garrett was postmaster. In 1849, a French-Canadian man, Sorel Sophy (sometimes recorded as: Soffey), along with his wife and brother packed all their belongings into a canoe, and set out on the Rideau River from the Kemptville area. Their intention was to find a new location to settle; eventually they decided on a piece of land located within Garretton, and built a farm. This led to the trio becoming the first and only people within the area who secured their land through squatter's rights. The hamlet of Garretton was considered to be fairly isolated from other communities; the first roads in the area were old native-American trails, and a corduroy road built by the first settlers along the river.\n\nGarretton is situated along what was once the old stage coach road between Bishop's Mills and Prescott; it cost 25 cents to travel on this route. In the 1800s, this resulted in Garretton being a thriving community. Garretton had its own post office, as well as a saw mill, cheese factory, general store, brickyard and schoolhouse. Many early settlers to Garretton made a living through farming or agriculture. Hops became a popular cash crop as at the time there were distilleries and breweries located along the St. Lawrence River.\n\nGarretton had enough school aged pupils to support its own schoolhouse and become its own school section. The schoolhouse in Garretton was referred to as S.S. # 21 Garretton School. During the 1800s, the schoolhouse was rebuilt twice. The first school was a log structure located just off of South Branch Road. This structure was primitive and prone to flooding from a nearby creek. To replace this schoolhouse, a new one was built slightly to the north of the previous log structure. This schoolhouse fell into disrepair quickly as well; reportedly, there were large holes in the floor due to rat infestations. The second schoolhouse was demolished and in 1915 a third school was built in its place. The new school cost around $2,700 at the time and is a one-storey frame structure. In the 1960s, the school added an extension to accommodate students from the nearby South Branch school section which had closed. The school closed in 1971 due to the opening of the more modern Maynard Public school which amalgamated the small school sections.\n\nIn 1866, an Anglican church was built in Garretton called St. Andrew's Church on land donated by a local man the year prior. The church is a white frame church with a front porch and gothic style stained glass. The original church is still standing, but has been renovated twice since its construction; the original floor which was built by the parishioners is still in the church. Although membership to the church has significantly declined, the building is still sometimes used. Behind the church is St. Andrews Anglican Cemetery which was established a year prior to the church's construction in 1865. The earliest burial took place that same year and was that of Joseph Garrett. The cemetery was still in use as of 1985. Garretton at one time had a Methodist church which was constructed in the late 1800s on the Ninth Concession called Salem Methodist Church. At its height, the church had a congregation of around 40 families and was known for holding oyster dinners. After the church closed, the building was eventually torn down and the timber was used to construct a recreation hall in Bishop's Mills.\n\nGlenmore, Ontario, is a community located between Charleville and Algonquin, Ontario, and north of Lord's Mills. The community encompasses the area between DeJong Road and Glenmore Road, off of the Sixth Concession. The area was settled as a small agricultural community and was known for its market gardening; prior to 1800, there were already small farms and a sawmill located in the community. The community was, and occasionally still is, referred to as Slab Street due to the amount of lumber production which occurred there in the 1800s.\n\nDuring the 1800s, the community of Glenmore was fairly prosperous with many businesses operating out of the area. At its height, the community had two saw mills which produced more than enough materials and supplies for the community; there was also a blacksmith, a tannery, ashery, lime kiln, cheese factory and a carpenter's shop, as well as a millinery and dressmaking shop. The community had its own post office for a brief period, opening in 1882 and closing in 1912. Market gardening was a profitable profession for many early residents of the settlement. The area was locally known for its quality vegetables, specializing in onions, potatoes, cabbage, celery and cauliflower. Vegetables grown in Glenmore were recorded as being sold by the truckload in nearby cities such as Ottawa. Glenmore during this period also had its own cemetery.\n\nThe first town hall established for Augusta Township was located within the community of Glenmore, situated at the intersection of Algonquin Road and Glenmore Road. The rectangular, stone building was erected in 1858 after a long debate as to where to build the structure. The final building site was chosen due to its centralized location. The building was fully constructed in December 1858 by local men. The hall was used for more than just political purposes, as social gatherings were also held there;. In 1899, the building was used during a smallpox epidemic as a vaccination site. The site eventually fell into disrepair and became too costly to maintain and as a result was closed. Council meetings were held in an old schoolhouse before a new town hall was erected in Maynard in 1968, closer to the front of the township where the population was more dense.\n\nThe first schoolhouse in the community was built along Concession 5 in the year 1840. This school was around for many decades before a school inspector declared the building to be unsafe and in need of replacing. When the school was rebuilt, they decided to change locations to the Sixth Concession where most of the pupils lived. The new building was constructed in 1913 and was made of brick; it was a one-storey building with a basement. The new school was called S.S. #13, Union Grove School. The school was closed around the 1960s due to lack of enrolment and was later converted into a home.\n\nGlenmore also had its own Methodist church to serve the community, called Cedar Grove Congregational Methodist Church. It was a frame church built sometime in the late 1800s on Concession 5, Lot 21 on the forced road south of the Sixth Concession. In 1939 the church was moved from its original location to the spot where the Glenmore cheese factory had stood. Just before 1920, the church allegedly became a Standard Church for many years until its closure in 1956. In the 1960s the property was sold for use as a private residence.\n\nHerron's Corners refers to the area surrounding the intersection of County Road 15 and Dixon Road in Augusta Township, Ontario, just south of the village of North Augusta. According to a nineteenth-century map of Augusta, a family with the last name Herron occupied the land at this intersection and are likely responsible for the name of the community. It is unclear what businesses, if any, ever ran within the community however the Herron's Corners was its own school section with a small schoolhouse.\n\nHerron's Corners was known as schools section number 23 and its schoolhouse being named S.S. #23 Herron's School. The first Herron's School was made of stone, and located on the northwest corner of the intersection on donated property around 1855. The schoolhouse burned in 1876 and was replaced the following year by a brick building. The new school was a one-story brick structure with a frame porch and bell tower; the average attendance at the school was only 20 pupils. When this school closed, it was used as a private residence until it too was destroyed by fire; currently a modern home stands on the former site.\n\nLimerick Forest, Ontario refers to the 8,000 acre section of forest located in the northeast corner of the township; formerly, there was a small Irish settlement located here called simply Limerick. The Irish settlers arrives from Northern Ireland shortly after the Loyalists in 1840. The area of Limerick Forest was the only land available and not occupied by the British; this was mostly due to the fact the area was sandy and covered in bogs - not ideal for agriculture. The citizens named their new settlement after the county in Ireland in homage to their ancestral home. By the mid 1800s, the community was a fairly thriving farming community. Most farmers grew hops which were sold to Prescott's breweries. It is said that homemade whiskey was a popular commodity in the area during this time, with many families selling it out of their homes.\n\nAround the mid 1800s, Limerick became its own union school section with some students from Oxford-on-Rideau and Edwardsburgh townships attending school at this location for convenience. The school was located at the northeast corner of the community between the ninth and tenth concessions and called S.S. #24 Limerick School. The first schoolhouse was built sometime prior to 1861, as maps from 1861 mention the existence of a schoolhouse at Limerick, however little else is known about this first school. This school was replaced around 1876 by a white frame building built on the same location as the first. Limerick School always had fairly low attendance as the terrain in the area was wet and hard to travel, it was closed in the mid 1900s. In 1964 the building was sold to an Oxford-on-Rideau farmer, then later bought back by Limerick Forest officials who claimed the building was a fire hazard. The building was moved back into the forest and altered with additions added to be used as an office building.\n\nAt the start of the twentieth century, Limerick branched off into two small communities, the new community being called Shanty Knoll. Shanty Knoll had its own frame schoolhouse as well as a small church, known as Joe Goodin's Protestant Church. This small community peaked in 1918 before fading from existence; little to no details are known regarding the community or its school and church.\n\nDuring the Great Depression many of the residents of the community could not afford to hold onto their farms; most of the land and farms which made up the community were sold back to the county. In December 1939, the county of Leeds and Grenville announced they were to plan a community forest surrounding the old settlement of Limerick, to be called Limerick Forest. The plan was to reforest the land which had been cleared by the Irish. 340 acres were set aside in 1940 to become Limerick Forest. The reforestation effort provided jobs to the surrounding townships. By the 1980s, the forest had grown to 8,000 acres. Today, Limerick Forest is popular amongst locals for outdoor recreation activities such as snowmobiling or hiking. Most of the old homes and building that made up the community were lost when the forest was planted.\n\nLord's Mills, Ontario, is a small community located along Lord's Mills Road in Augusta Township. Before being settled by Europeans, the location was inhabited by natives; many arrowheads and pieces of pottery attributed to native cultures have been found in the community. When the area was first settled, the community was known as Ireland because of the number of Irish settlers living there. The community became known as Lord's Mills in 1815 after Charles Lord attempted to establish mills in the village. At its height, the village contained a saw and grist mill, a cheese factory, a blacksmith, post office, church, cemetery, general store, temperance hall, Orange Lodge, and school.\n\nIn 1815, Charles Lord of Montreal purchased land in Lord's Mills which had previously been a Loyalist land grant property. On this land he intended to build a saw and grist mill using a water wheel for power. The mill was successfully built however the location proved to be a problem; when the water was too low or too high, which happened frequently, the mill could not run. Despite of this, it remained in use for five years before Lord decided to improve the mill by erecting a windmill. Only one bushel of corn was ground using the mill before it stopped working due to being surrounded by forest and high land. The building was then sold and converted into a shingle mill. By the mid-to-late 1800s, Lord's Mills was flourishing with the aforementioned businesses and services all in operation. Most residents made a living through farming, growing vegetables, grains and hops as well as raising livestock.\n\nIn 1886, land was donated in Lord's Mills to be used for a burial ground and to hold a church to serve the village; this church was called Christ's Church and was of Anglican denomination. The church is a stone structure with a belfry and Gothic-style windows; some windows are stained glass while other are frosted with etched designs. Prior to the churches inception, religious services were held in the schoolhouse or temperance hall. Accompanying this church is a small cemetery, known as Christ's Church Cemetery which was established the same year the church was built in 1886. The first burial took place four years later in 1890.\n\nAlthough it is unclear when it became so, Lord's Mills was its own school section during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with its own schoolhouse. The school was known as S.S. #10 Lord's Mills School. The first S.S. #10 building was located on the same location where the current building sits; it is unclear when this first school was built or why the structure was replaced. In 1916, the frame schoolhouse, which currently still stands, was built to serve as the new Lord's Mills School. Attendance was never high, and the school closed periodically from 1932 until its permanent closure in the 1960s. The building is currently used as a private residence.\n\nMaynard, Ontario, is a small village located northwest of Prescott along County Road 26. The origin of the village's name is obscure as there was no Maynard family located here at the time; local historians trace the name to a story from a Canadian series of school readers from c.1878 which mentioned a John Maynard, a naval officer who died attempting to steer a burning ship to shore. According to the reader, compiled by one J. E Cough, the ship caught fire on Lake Erie, passengers and crew crowded to one end of the ship while Maynard steered it safely to shore. The crew was saved, however Maynard did not survive; to quote the reader \"…John Maynard dropped overboard, and his spirit took its flight to his God.\" Before being called Maynard, the village was referred to as both Heck's Settlement, after the family of Barbara Heck, and Chippenhook after the creek which ran through it. The eastern part of the village, near the intersection of Merwin Lane and County Road 26 was formerly its own small community called Brundage's Corners.\n\nMaynard was settled early in the township's history due to its proximity to the landing points at Johnstown and Blakey's point, located south of the village. Iroquois were living in the settlement prior to this, before being pushed out by European settlements. Farming was the primary industry in the 1800s in Maynard, however many other businesses prospered here at the time. Maynard boasted its own saw and grist mill, tannery, blacksmith shop, churches, cemetery, two schoolhouses, a few cheese factories, temperance hall, post office, general store as well as an inn, located at Brundage's Corners.\n\nDuring the 1800s and early 1900s, Maynard was divided into two school sections, S.S. #5 and S.S. #7. The schools were both named accordingly, S.S. #5 Dulmage's School and S.S. #7 Brundage's School. Brundage's School is located along County Road 26 at the intersection of Hillbrook Road and Merwin Lane. Brundage's replaced three small log schoolhouses which were scattered around the area, one of which was located on the site of the current structure. This school was open until the 1960s, and was sold in 1970 to be used as a private residence as it remains today. West of Maynard was the other school, Dulmage's School. The first structure was built in the early 1800s and was a stone building, in 1840 it was replaced by a newer one and moved to the north side of the road. It was closed in the 1960s and converted into a home. Both of these schools closed due to the opening of Maynard Public School.\n\nIn 1817, Maynard became the site of the township church, known as the Augusta Chapel. This frame church was located on the current site of the Maynard Cemetery. At one time, it was the only church to serve the township. In 1833, the church became a Wesleyan Methodist church, which caused some of the congregation to break off and create their own churches. The frame structure was replaced by a brick building in 1873, which was eventually town down in 1912 after becoming a Baptist church for a period of time. The baptists of Maynard built their own church in the early 1900s, after trustees turned down their offer to buy the old Augusta Chapel. The Baptist church was located across from the cemetery, and was torn down in the 1940s. After the conversion of the Augusta Chapel, one of the churches which was built in opposition was the Victoria United Church in 1833. This small stone church was a Methodist Episcopal church. In 1859, the church was rebuilt to accommodate a larger congregation using the stones from the old church, and new brick. This church is still in use today. The Maynard United Pentecostal church is located at the southern end of Charleville Road in Maynard. This church was built in 1971 to replace the Pentecostal church in Charleville. This church is also still in use.\nMcLeanville, Ontario, is the name given to a small rural area located along McLeanville road off of County Road 21 in Augusta Township. The community presently consists of a few farms and houses but at one point, was a thriving pioneer hamlet with a few businesses such as an ashery, temperance hall, schoolhouse, and church. McLeanville was at its height during the mid-to-late 1800s; at this time, it was large enough to support its own school section. The school was titled S.S. #14 McLeanville school. The school was replaced once; the first structure was stone, and the second building was brick, made in 1885. The school was closed before the 1960s and sold to become a private residence. Later, the building was moved to be incorporated into a local farming complex.\n\nMcLeanville had its own Methodist Church located within the community in the late 1800s. Land was purchased for the church around 1890, and the brick church was constructed shortly after but in operation for only briefly before it closed around 1913 for financial reasons. The church was moved to the same local farm as the schoolhouse to be used as an outbuilding.\n\nPerrin's Corners, Ontario, is the name given to the small community once located at the intersection of the Sixth Concession and Charleville Road. According to nineteenth-century maps, the community once had a temperance hall, cemetery, and a schoolhouse. The community was named for the Perrin family, who first occupied the area; the community mostly consisted of farms. In 1851, trustees in Perrin's Corners petitioned the township to become their own school section. The school and section became known as S.S. #12 Perrin's School. The school is a frame building which was built on land belonging to the Perrin family. The school was closed sometime before the 1950s. The schoolhouse has been renovated many times and is currently a private residence.\n\nRoebuck, Ontario, is a small hamlet located approximately 13 km north of the St. Lawrence River; its centre location being the intersection of County Roads 18 and 21. The official boundaries of the hamlet are within an approximately 200 m radius from this intersection. The hamlet is built around what was once the site of an Iroquoian village with a population of around 1,600 villagers. Initially, the hamlet was referred to as Heck's Corners, after the Heck family who established many businesses here in the 19th century. By 1866, postal records indicate the hamlet was officially named Roebuck. The population of Roebuck including the surrounding rural areas was around 300 individuals.\n\nThe first recorded settler to the area known as Roebuck was Isaac Jackson, who established his homestead there in 1840; it is believed however that the area was settled much earlier and land ownership never recorded. By the 1860s, the village boasted a sawmill, post office, schoolhouse, general store and a tavern. Many residents at this time sought an income through agriculture, and grew hops to supply local breweries. Roebuck continued to prosper as a village throughout the late 1800s as the distance between the village and neighbouring towns was a fair commute for nineteenth-century farmers, and there was a need to be a self-reliant community. By this time, Roebuck had also established a second general store, a cheese factory, a blacksmith, and a community hall.\n\nThe Roebuck Cheese Factory was located on the corner of Forsyth Road and County Road 21. Many communities in the area had their own cheese factories so farmers had a place to sell their excess milk produced from their cattle. The factory was built by a local man on Lot 5, Concession Seven in 1875, just eleven years after the first cheese factory opened in Canada. The Roebuck Cheese Factory was privately owned and operated for 48 years. The hired cheese maker lived on the second floor of the factory. In 1923, the factory became a stock company and was given many upgrades. According to oral history the factory burned down and was repaired or rebuilt three separate times, the last fire occurring in 1931. The factory managed to sell its cheese briefly in the international market and sold both butter and cheese to neighbouring communities. The factory closed in 1965 and was sold a year later to be used as a blacksmithing shop. The last business to run out of the factory building was a welding shop in the mid to late 1980s. The building is still standing but not in good repair.\n\nDuring the separate school era, Roebuck had its own school section within Augusta Township, but it was a union school with the neighbouring township of Edwardsburgh, and was located almost between the two townships along County Road 21. The school was known in Augusta as S.S. #25 Roebuck School and as S.S. #19 in Edwardsburgh. The building that still stands today was the second school built on the same location and was constructed in 1870. The first school was demolished prior to this as it was in bad repair. The land for the school was donated by Peter Drummond, a man from the neighbouring township of Edwardsburgh. Around 100 pupils attended to school ranging in age from five years to twenty years of age. The school was permanently closed in 1965 when transportation improved and larger schools were built in the more established villages. The schoolhouse was later sold and converted into a private residence.\n\nOne of the first churches which served Roebuck was called Drummond's Methodist Church and was located along the border of Augusta and Edwardsburgh townships on property belonging to the Drummond family along County Road 21. The church was commonly referred to as Drummond's Union Sabbath School and remained open for nearly a century before closing due to financial troubles. This church was erected in 1815 and remained there until around 1913. Although the building was demolished, there is a stone monument in its former location which reads \"Drummond's Union Sabbath School, 1815-1913\". In 1914, a Methodist church was built within the community of Roebuck to replace Drummond's church, which was then known as the Roebuck Methodist Church. When the building was first erected, it was described in a local newspaper as \"of a Gothic type, built of concrete, and shingled with galvanized iron.\" Around this time, land was purchased near the Methodist church for $10 to construct a Presbyterian church. The Roebuck Presbyterian Church was a white, frame structure with a steeple at the front and stained glass windows. The Presbyterian church operated until 1925, when a union between the Presbyterian and Methodist church was formed. Roebuck Methodist Church became Roebuck United Church, and the Presbyterian church was closed and later demolished. Roebuck United Church still stands and still serves the community. Although the interior remains largely unchanged, the outside of the building was covered in stucco in 1961 to prevent further deterioration.\n\nPresent day, not many farms or businesses remain in Roebuck, Ontario, but it still has a community hall, which was officially opened in 1975 replacing a small stone structure that had previously served as the community hall. The hall is used for dances, receptions and as a venue for other social events in the township.\n\nSouth Augusta, Ontario, refers to an area along County Road 26, in Augusta Township, near Bethel Road. The community was, at its height in the late 1800s and early 1900s, with a few small businesses and farms then operating there. South Augusta was home to a schoolhouse, cheese factory, tannery, temperance hall, grocery store, post office, two churches, and a cemetery. Many residents made a living through farming, and hop and lime kilns were popular in the community. Today, South Augusta is a residential community.\n\nSouth Augusta had its first schoolhouse constructed in the late 1700s, when settlers first arrived in the area; the building was made of log and was replaced in 1820 by a stone building built upon land donated by the Read family. South Augusta around this time officially became its own school section, with the school being titled S.S. #30 Read's School. This school section was a union section with the neighbouring township of Elizabethtown. In 1877, the building was replaced by another stone structure with a frame bell tower and brick chimney. After the school closed, the building was abandoned for year before being turned into a private residence, as it remains today.\n\nThe first church built in South Augusta was built in 1878, and served as a church for both South Augusta and the neighbouring community of Bethel. This church was called Bethel United Church and is still occasionally used today. Originally, this church was a Methodist church. The church is a brick church with Gothic-style windows, and in 1958, an addition was added to the back. The second church in South Augusta was known as St. George's Anglican Church, which was constructed in 1887. The building is made of cut stone, and features a square tower with a belfry and a basement; the windows are made of stained glass. Prior to these churches, it is said in reports from the early nineteenth century that a stone church may have been present in the community in 1811. According to some local history books such as \"the History of Leeds and Grenville\" by one Thad Leavitt, locals attempted to build a church themselves during this time, however the walls fell before the church was completed, and it was never established.\n\nSouth Branch, Ontario is the name given to an area along Branch Road, northeast of North Augusta. According to nineteenth century maps the community had its own schoolhouse and temperance hall, however it mostly consisted of a few farms. According to post office records, the community also had its own post office.\n\nSouth Branch was at one point during the 19th century, large enough to sustain its own school section. The school located here along South Branch Road was called S.S. # 18 South Branch School. The first schoolhouse was primitive, built in 1845 of grout, mortar cement and gravel and burned in 1881. A year later it was replaced by a brick structure with a frame porch and a small belfry. This school closed in 1963 and the building was later sold for $1 to the church in Garretton to be used as a parish hall.\n\nStone's Corners, Ontario refers to the area surrounding the intersection of County Roads 26 and 15 west of Maynard.\n\n[The area was named after Lyman Stone(1791-1870) who was born in Arlington, Bennington County, Vermont. He was not a Loyalist, nor was his father, Elisha Stone(1769-1799) who lived and died in Arlington, Vermont, without serving on either side in the American Revolution. His wife's Grandfather, Daniel Burritt(1735-1827), was a United Empire Loyalist.]\n\nthe Stone family, a Loyalist family which first settled here. The community was a small agricultural community; many residents in the nineteenth century made a living selling hops or operation limekilns. At its height, the community had a temperance hall, schoolhouse and church.\n\nStone's Corners became its own school section during the mid-1800s, the schoolhouse being titled S.S. #6 Stone's Corners. The first S.S. #6 was a stone building located east of the intersection. The first building was replaced due to deterioration and overcrowding; the second building was constructed in 1874, 300 yards west of the old structure. The stone was constructed by locals with stone produced in the community. The school was closed in the mid-1900s due to lack of enrolment, and the building abandoned; in 1973 it was demolished and a bungalow was built on site.\n\nIn 1890, a Presbyterian church was built in Stone's Corners. The congregation of this church was formed much earlier, with services being held in the schoolhouse. The church was a white frame building, located on donated land. The church closed in 1957 and was used for meetings of Baptists for a period of time. In the 1970s it was demolished and replaced by a modern home.\n\nIn 1977, the community was planned for large-scale development; developers proposed a new town site on the location to be called Stoneacres, Ontario. 800 homes were to be built surrounding the intersection as well as a 14-store shopping complex. In the end, development plans were cancelled for a variety of reasons: the township could not really afford the development, and neighbouring schools and services could not accommodate the influx of people, additionally, it would destroy valuable farm land. Presently, only a few farms and houses make up Stone's Corners. In recent years, the intersection has been known locally for the number of accidents which have taken place there despite the stop signs and flashing red lights.\n\nThrooptown, Ontario, is the name given to an old community located along County Road 21 at its intersection with Kyle Road east of North Augusta. The village was named after the Throop family who settled there in the 1800s. During the nineteenth century, the population of the community was around 100 people. Today, Throoptown is a rural farming community consisting of residential homes and farms.\n\nIn the 19th century, Throoptown was a thriving pioneer community. According to the Dominion of Canada Business directory, during this century Throoptown contained a feed mill, cheese factory, general store, post office, and a shoemaker; the village also had a church, a cemetery, and two schools. In 1840, an inn called the Throoptown Inn operated out of the community. The village also became its own school section at the time, with its schoolhouse being known as S.S. #15 Brown's School. Little records exist except for it being mentioned in a payment record and listed on a 19th-century map. No trace of the building exists today. Additionally, a Roman Catholic separate school operated in the area, the establishment of which was petitioned by the residents of Throoptown. Little is known about the school, and the building no longer stands.\n\nIn 1845, a Roman Catholic church, called St. Michael's Church, was erected to serve Throoptown at the corner of Kyle Road. Land was purchased for the church from a local for around five pounds. The structure was built of local stone and plastered over in white sometime later with a square tower topped with a cross at its front. The church was rebuilt once, after a fire caused by lightning severely damaged the building in 1925. The church was rebuilt from mostly the same materials. The new church was renamed St. Theresa's, and a hall, which was formerly part of Wiser's distillery, was added to the grounds. In 1971, the church caught fire a second time and was completely destroyed and this time not rebuilt. The hall was sold around the same time and moved from the location.\n\nIn close proximity to where the church was is St. Theresa's Roman Catholic cemetery, which was also formerly called St. Michael's. In 1846, when the land as purchased to become an official cemetery, it had already been used as a burial ground by the community and according to local histories was a native burial place. In 1852, a large cross was placed in the cemetery and remains there. The earliest legible stone in the cemetery belongs to James Delaney, who died in July 1843. This cemetery is still in use.\n\nAugusta Township is home to many small cemeteries, many of which were erected in the 19th century; some are still currently in use. There are also many old, family burial grounds and tiny abandoned cemeteries in the township as well as known native burial grounds. Due to the age of some of the tombstones in the area, they cannot properly be transcribed. Early cemetery records obtained by the Grenville Historical Society have only given moderate insight into the area's first cemeteries that are unmarked, or completely destroyed/illegible. It is strongly believed that the township is home to many more family burial plots, which were never recorded, and the whereabouts remain unknown. The Ontario Cemeteries Act requires all of the known cemeteries and burial ground in Augusta to receive minimum care, if not already being attended to by any person or organization. As a result of strict funding in regards to Cemetery Boards and care, most of the responsibility of preserving centuries-old burial grounds falls directly onto local volunteers. So far, volunteers have succeeded in transcribing every legible stone in the township. In addition to the pioneer and family burial grounds, there are many denominational cemeteries within the communities of Augusta which have been mentioned in the previous sections.\n\nThe following is a list of all the known cemeteries located within the township of Augusta, including family burial plots: \n\n\n\n\n\nBissell Cemetery is located along the Fifth Concession on Lot 34 near Algonquin, Ontario. The cemetery occupies a space of around a quarter acre and is currently operated and maintained by a board of trustees. The property on which the cemetery stands was originally a Crown Grant to a David Bissell, and officially became a cemetery in 1886. Burials took place here prior to this, however, with the earliest stone belonging to a Zenas Bissell, who died in 1853.\n\nCarpenter's Cemetery is a pioneer cemetery located on the Fifth Concession on Lot 36 which was established in 1815. The property was originally a Crown Grant to Isaiah Carpenter, who's tombstone is also the oldest readable stone in the cemetery, dated November 16, 1815. There are possibly older burials in this cemetery, as some graves are only marked with fieldstones and other and illegible.\n\nThe Maynard Cemetery located on County Road 26, although purchased by Methodists and still in use, began as a pioneer cemetery. The earliest legible inscription is from 1814 and reads \" Ruth dau. of Joseph and Louisa Scott who died Aug. 1, 1814 aged 16 y. 5 m.\"; there are possibly earlier burials, as some graves were only every marked with fieldstones if at all. By 1817 the property had been purchased by the Methodist church in order to officially become a cemetery with more land being purchased in 1848. Maynard Cemetery is currently maintained by a board of trustees.\n\nRead's Cemetery is located on Bethel Road just off of County Road 26 in Bethel, Ontario. Read's Cemetery was in use very early as the sign for the cemetery was erected in 1800. The cemetery's oldest readable stone belongs to Moses Read who died in 1802; there are many weathered stones in the cemetery that were once used as markers for older graves. This cemetery is located between two properties, which used to belong to the Row and the Read families who donated the land for the cemetery. The iron fence surrounding the graveyard was erected in 1918 and was built by local individuals who canvassed the money for the build. Read's Cemetery is currently looked after by a board of trustees.\n\nIn Roebuck, there is a historical plaque located on County Road 21 which honours the site of an Iroquoian village. This plaque also marks the site of a 500-year-old burial ground which was excavated in the 20th century. In total, 120 skeletons were excavated from the site; 85 of the skeletons belonging to Iroquoian villagers, and 35 of the skeletons, which were buried further away from the others, were from outsiders. When the remains were studied, it was determined the first set of 85 skeletons were villagers, due to the fact the skeletons were relatively intact, and nicely buried; some skeletons were even buried in pairs. The group of 35 skeletons was determined to be the bones of captives or enemies of the tribe, with only a slight possibility of the remains being those of Iroquoian people. This conclusion was made after archaeologists ruled at least 31 of the 34 skeletons recovered belonged to young men; in contrast to the former group of remains which contained a mixed demographic in regards to age and gender. The latter group of 35 skeletons were also found disarticulated or fragmented; and many proven to be victims of cannibalism.\n\nThere are many known private, family cemeteries located within the township of Augusta. These cemeteries are mostly located on private property and were mostly once small family plots from a time when it was common to bury family on the property. Most of these cemeteries are not accessible to the public and are abandoned.\n\nDurham Cemetery is located on the first concession, Lot 36 on property which was received as a Crown Grant by a Loyalist name Daniel Durham. Only one stone from this burial site exists, however it is located elsewhere. Allegedly, the burial ground was converted into a pig sty by a later property owner and the other tombstones lost. The individuals buried in this cemetery are mostly members of the Durham family.\n\nFell Cemetery is an old burying ground located near Domville, at the intersection of Maple Avenue and County Road 18. One tombstone has been recovered from the property, the inscription simply reading \"B. Fell D 11 A 1819\"; it is unknown whether or not any other tombstones ever existed here, however fieldstones once marked the place of the graves. It is presumed the rest of the individuals buried here are members of the Fell family, as the property was a Crown Grant to a man named Frederick Fell in 1804.\n\nThe Jones Burying Ground is located on property once belonging to Solomon Jones and his descendants. At least four broken, marble tombstones were recovered on the Jones' properties by archaeologists which are now preserved at the Homewood Museum.\n\nKingston Cemetery is located at the intersection of Charleville Road and the Sixth Concession on property which once belonged to the Kingston family in the mid-1800s. Kingston Cemetery consists of only four tombstones, each a member of the Kingston family.\n\nThe Mosher Burying Ground is a small family cemetery located north of the bottom section of Merwin Lane, where it splits of towards the west. Little is known about the origins of the cemetery; no tombstones were present, just fieldstones marking the graves. These stones were later moved when the road was widened leaving no trace of the cemetery. Locals referred to the burial ground and surrounding area as \"Spook Hill\" due to local lore about paranormal sightings in the area.\n\nMcGuin Cemetery is located on private property along the Sixth Concession on Lot 19. The property was originally a grant to Edward Jackson and was sold several times before becoming the property of the McGuin family in 1872. The first burial took place in 1812, making it one of the earlier pioneer cemeteries in the area. The last known burial took place here in 1949 and the cemetery has since been largely abandoned.\n\nThere is a small private cemetery located just north of Garretton along Cooper Road called Reynolds' Cemetery. Around five different family names can be found in this cemetery; the last burial took place here in 1971.\n\nAccording to 2011 census data, the population of children, individuals who are 0–14 years of age, accounted for 15.2% of the total population of Augusta. 17.4% of the population were aged 65 years or older, and 67.4% of the population consisted of working-aged individuals; ages 15 through 64. The percentages of both working-aged individuals and children are below the national averages, however the percentage of senior residents is above the national average by almost 3%. The median age of 46 in the township is over 5% higher than both the provincial and national median ages.\n\nAccording to NHS data, in 2011 foreign-born immigrants accounted for only 8.5% of the total population, while 91.5% were Canadian-born. The percentage of foreign-born immigrants in Augusta is 20% lower than the provincial percentage of 28.5%. There were no non-permanent residents reported in the township. 8% of the immigrants accounted for were recent immigrants, having landed between 2006–2011; the most common country of origin being the Netherlands or the United Kingdom. In 2011, 92.8% spoke an official language (English and/or French) at home; the most frequently reported non-official language by recent immigrants was Tagalog.\n\nIn 2011, an estimated 70 individuals, or 0.9% of the total population of Augusta were considered visible minorities; 25% below the provincial percentage. The largest minority group being of Filipino or South Asian descent. The most frequently cited ethnic origins of Augusta's populace were solely, or a combination of: Canadian, English and Irish.\n\nIn 2011, Augusta Township had a labour force of 4,140 individuals; 3,885 people were listed as employed while 250 were listed as unemployed. The employment rate was at 61.4% while the unemployment rate was 6.0%. Within the township, 11.2% of the workforce was aged 15–24, and 20.8% were aged 55 to 64. This compares with Ontario at 12.6% and 15.2% respectively. The majority of the workforce is aged 35–54 years, accounting for 49.2% of the workforce.\nWithin the township of Augusta, the most common occupations were service support or other service occupations, technical occupations relating to natural or applied sciences, and administrative occupations. The top industries in Augusta according to the 2011 census were: manufacturing, health care and social assistance, and retail trade. \nIn the year 2011, 0.4% of Augusta's commuters used some form of public transit to get to their workplace, which is a low number when compared to the rest of Ontario. 90.4% of the population of commuters used their own car or vehicle to get to work, and 5.7% reported being a passenger in a car or vehicle for their commute. The average commuting time for those working out of Augusta Township is 22.1 minutes, slightly lower than the provincial average. 82.5% reported working at their regular workplace, 9.5% reported working from home and 7.7% had no fixed work address. \nIn the year 2010, 84.8% of Augusta's total income was market income, with 81.9% of that coming from employment income. 15.2% of the income was composed of government transfer payments, mostly from the Canadian Pension Plan. 21.6% of the population of Augusta Township reported having no income or an income of less than $12,025 per year. 50.1% of Augusta's population had a household income of $27,815 or higher.\n\nNational Household Survey data from 2011 states that 84.7% of the population of Augusta associated themselves with a religion; leaving only 15.3% of the population unaffiliated with any religious denomination. The most common religion stated was with the United Church, second most common being both Anglican and Roman Catholic. In contrast, statistics for the rest of Ontario report that Roman Catholic is the most frequently reported religion in the Province; the United church being the second most frequent and Anglican the third.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2061370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061370", "title": "Batepá massacre", "text": "Batepá massacre\n\nThe Batepá massacre occurred on 3 February 1953 in São Tomé when hundreds of native creoles known as \"forros\" were massacred by the colonial administration and Portuguese landowners. Many \"forros\" believed the government intended to force them to work as contract laborers, to which they objected. In response, the governor blamed the unrest on communists and ordered the military to round up such individuals and for civilians to protect themselves. This quickly turned into a bloodbath, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of \"forros\". No communist conspiracy was ever proven.\n\nCarlos Gorgulho assumed office as governor in 1945. At the time São Tomé Island was one of the world's largest producers of cocoa. Large plantations, called \"roças\", occupied the majority of the island's farmland. The \"roças\" operated as a quasi-feudal system using contract laborers (\"serviçais\") from mainland Africa and Cape Verde. The \"forros\" had always refused manual field work on the estates, since they considered it slave labor. In Gorgulho's assessment the economic modernization policies of the Portuguese \"Estado Novo\" regime required breaking São Tomé's dependence on contract laborers from overseas. To accomplish this Gorgulho implemented policies to make it easier for \"serviçais\" to return home while at the same time improving conditions on the \"roças\", which he hoped would attract local labor. He also introduced measures targeting the livelihood of the \"forros\" such as prohibiting the sale of palm wine and the locally produced gin and raising the poll tax from 30 to 90 escudos; Gorgulho believed these measures would result in the \"forros\" taking up wage labor on the roças.\n\nGorgulho also faced a shortage of labor to carry out his public works and construction projects. The colonial administration used police raids to kidnap people for forced labor gangs to carry out much of this work.\n\nFaced with widespread labor shortages, in 1952 the colonial administration proposed settling fifteen thousand people from Cape Verde on São Tomé; then in January 1953 rumors spread that the government would seize the land of the \"forros\" to give to newly arrived Cape Verdians and compel the \"forros\" to work as contract labor. On February 2, 1953, hand-written pamphlets appeared in São Tomé threatening to kill anyone who contracted \"forros\" as laborers. The government responded with on official declaration: \"The government has been informed that individuals who are hostile towards the present policy, known as communists, are spreading tendentious rumors to the effect that the creoles are to be obliged to contract themselves for the work on the \"roças\" like \"serviçais.\" The government declares that no creole should give credit to these rumors, but should report such individuals to the police. Thus, the government which has the obligation to protect the creoles, as it has always demonstrated, guarantees them that it will never agree to authorize such contracts.\" Crowds of protestors gathered on February 3 and the police killed one of them, Manuel da Conceição Soares. His death precipitated a large protest in Trindade the following day.\n\nGorgulho informed colonists and the administration that a communist rebellion was in the offing and he issued a call for all white colonists to take up arms to protect themselves and white women. Militias were quickly formed and some Cape Verdians responded to the call-to-arms. In addition, planters mobilized Angolan and Mozambican workers. Over the next few days the militias and colonial government killed hundreds of \"forros\". Twenty-eight people were suffocated in a cell by the local police, the \"Corpo de Polícia Indígena\" (CPI, Indigenous Police Corps); on one estate, twenty people were burned to death. The authorities subjected prisoners to torture using electricity and scores of prisoners died as a result of torture, beatings, and forced labor. The authorities dumped many bodies into the sea. \"Throw this shit into the sea to avoid troubles,\" Gorgulho is quoted as advising.\n\nOn March 4 members of the Portuguese International and State Defense Police arrived to conduct an investigation into the alleged communist conspiracy. They quickly concluded there was no such conspiracy and, in April, Sarmento Rodrigues, the Minister of Overseas Territories, ordered Gorgulho to return to Lisbon. He was promoted to the rank of general and praised by the Minister of the Army, General Abranches Pinto, for his actions. Seven \"forros\" were tried and convicted for the killing of two police officers. It marked the rise of the independence movement in Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe, and is commemorated annually as a national holiday (\"Dia de Mártires da Liberdade\") on February 3.\n\n\n"}

He became a priest then studied civil law at the University of Orléans as well as at Cambridge, graduating as doctor of Civil Law.\n\nIn 1466 King was appointed Rector of Broughton, Hampshire, and in 1473 Warden of St John's Hospital, Dorchester. Under the new regime of Edward IV of England he was appointed Clerk of the Signet in 1473, in 1475 was sent as ambassador to the Duke of Brittany.\n\nOn 18 March 1476, Oliver King Master of the seven liberal Arts and Licentiate in Laws, became the king's 'first and principal Secretary' for the French tongue for life, and succeeded William Hatteclyffe as king's secretary in 1480.; and receiving the salary of £20 per annum. Supposedly being expert in \"the French language\" Dr King was effectively second secretary, discharging the duties of the Signet in Hatteclyffe's absence. Under Edward IV the Secretary's office expanded the number of clerks to at least four, with a Gentleman and \"writers of the King's Signet under him\".\nThe Secretary and his clerks pay for their carriage of harness in court, except a little coffer to which the king's warrants and bills are signed, and other letters and remembrances be kept ...Thiis coffer is carried at the King's cost, whereas the Controller will sign.

During the early modern monarchy the Secretaries gradually assumed more importance, and standing at court, their office expanded and their salary improved to the same as the Clerk of the Council.\n\nIn 1480 he was appointed Canon of the eleventh stall at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, a position he held until 1503.\n\nKing was appointed Bishop of Exeter on 1 October 1492, consecrated on 3 February 1493. He was then translated to the see of Bath and Wells on 6 November 1495. He died on 29 August 1503.\n\nKing organised the restoration of Bath Abbey after 1500. The story of the refounding is told on the front of the Abbey in carved Bath stone. King had a dream in which he saw a host of angels on a ladder, the Holy Trinity and an olive tree with a crown on it. He heard a voice:\n\nKing believed this was a call for him to support the candidature of Henry Tudor as King, and to restore the Abbey. These images are carved on the West Front of the Abbey with coats of arms of the Montague Family (who paid for the carved wooden doors) and Henry VII's coat of arms. There are also statues of the twelve apostles, including a large statue of St Peter and one of Saint Paul.\n\n"}

A fundamental difficulty in describing few-body systems is that the Schrödinger equation and the classical equations of motion are not analytically solvable for more than two mutually interacting particles even when the underlying forces are precisely known. This is known as the few-body problem. For some three-body systems an exact solution can be obtained iteratively through the Faddeev equations. It can be shown that under certain conditions Faddeev equations should lead to Efimov effect. Some special cases of three-body systems are amenable to analytical solutions (or nearly so) - by special treatments - such as the Hydrogen molecular ion whose eigenenergies can be given in terms of a \"generalized\" Lambert W function or the Helium atom which has been solved very precisely using basis sets of Hylleraas or Frankowski-Pekeris functions (see references of the work of G.W.F. Drake and J.D. Morgan III in Helium atom section).\n\nIn many cases theory has to resort to approximations to treat few-body systems. These approximations have to be tested by detailed experimental data. Atomic collisions are particularly suitable for such tests. The fundamental force underlying atomic systems, the electromagnetic force, is essentially understood. Therefore, any discrepancy found between experiment and theory can be directly related to the description of few-body effects. In nuclear systems, in contrast, the underlying force is much less understood. Furthermore, in atomic collisions the number of particles can be kept small enough so that complete kinematic information about every single particle in the system can be obtained experimentally (see article on kinematically complete experiment). In systems with large particle numbers, in contrast, usually only statistically averaged or collective quantities about the system can be measured.\n\nIn classical mechanics, the few-body problem is a subset of the N-body problem.\n\nOne notable journal covering this field is \"Few-body Systems\".\n\nFew Body Topical Group at American Physical Society.\n\n\n"}

In the middle of the war, in 1916, he married Olive Selden Attride (1890–1978).\n\nIn 1922, he was appointed professor at the University of Cardiff, a post he would hold for the rest of his life. He was highly respected as a teacher in zoology and marine biology and also as a field researcher and taxonomist. Tattersall has an impressive publication record; he is the taxonomic authority for a large number of crustaceans, in particular of mysids and euphausiids. Most of the illustrations in his publications were drawn by his wife Olive who was a notable carcinologist in her own right.\n"}

{"id": "2061398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061398", "title": "Lake Nakuru", "text": "Lake Nakuru\n\nLake Nakuru is one of the Rift Valley soda lakes at an elevation of above sea level. It lies to the south of Nakuru, in the rift valley of Kenya and is protected by Lake Nakuru National Park.\n\nThe lake's abundance of algae used to attract a vast quantity of flamingos that famously lined the shore. Other birds also flourish in the area, as do warthogs, baboons and other large mammals. Eastern black rhinos and southern white rhinos have also been introduced.\n\nThe lake's level dropped dramatically in the early 1990s but has since largely recovered. In 2013, the lake received an alarming increase in the water levels that led to the migration of flamingos to Lake Bogoria in search for food supply. .\n\nNakuru means \"Dust or Dusty Place\" in the Maasai language. Lake Nakuru National Park, close to Nakuru town, was established in 1961. It started off small, only encompassing the famous lake and the surrounding mountainous vicinity, but has since been extended to include a large part of the savannahs.\n\nLake Nakuru is protected under the Ramsar Convention on wetlands.\n\nLake Nakuru National Park (188 km, 73 mi), was created in 1961 around Lake Nakuru, near Nakuru Town. It is best known for its thousands, sometimes millions of flamingos nesting along the shores. The surface of the shallow lake is often hardly recognizable due to the continually shifting mass of pink. The number of flamingos on the lake varies with water and food conditions and the best vantage point is from \"Baboon Cliff\". Also of interest is an area of 188 km (116 mi) around the lake fenced off as a sanctuary to protect giraffes as well as both black and white rhinos.\n\nThe park has recently been enlarged partly to provide the sanctuary for the black rhinos. This undertaking has necessitated a fence - to keep out poachers rather than to restrict the movement of wildlife. The park marches for 12.1 km on the south eastern boundary with the Soysambu conservancy which represents a possible future expansion of habitat for the rhinos and the only remaining wildlife corridor to Lake Naivasha.\n\nThe park now (2009) has more than 25 eastern black rhinoceros, one of the largest concentrations in the country, plus around 70 southern white rhinos. There are also a number of Rothschild's giraffe, again relocated for safety from western Kenya beginning in 1977. Waterbuck are very common and both the Kenyan subspecies are found here. Among the predators are lions, cheetahs and leopards, the latter being seen much more frequently in recent times. The park also has large sized pythons that inhabit the dense woodlands, and can often be seen crossing the roads or dangling from trees.\n\nAs well as flamingos, there are myriad other bird species that inhabit the lake and the area surrounding it, such as African fish eagle, Goliath heron, hamerkop, pied kingfisher and Verreaux's eagle among others of their kind. \n\nLake Nakuru, a small (it varies from 5 to 45 square kilometers) shallow alkaline lake on the southern edge of the town of Nakuru lies about 164 kilometers north of Nairobi. It can therefore be visited in a day tour from the capital or more likely as part of a circuit taking in the Masai Mara (Also Maasai Mara) or Lake Baringo and east to Samburu. The lake is world-famous as the location of the greatest bird spectacle on earth - myriads of fuchsia pink flamingos whose numbers are legion, often more than a million - or even two million. They feed on the abundant algae, which thrives in the warm waters. Scientists reckon that the flamingo population at Nakuru consumes about 250,000 kg of algae per hectare of surface area per year.\n\nThere are two types of flamingo species: the lesser flamingo can be distinguished by its deep red carmine bill and pink plumage unlike the greater, which has a bill with a black tip. The lesser flamingos are ones that are commonly pictured in documentaries mainly because they are large in number. The number of flamingos has been decreasing recently, perhaps due to too much tourism, pollution resulting from industries waterworks nearby who dump waste into the waters or simply because of changes in water quality which makes the lake temporarily inhospitable. Usually, the lake recedes during the dry season and floods during the wet season.\n\nIn recent years, there have been wide variations between the dry and wet seasons' water levels. It is suspected that this is caused by increasing watershed land conversion to intensive crop production and urbanization, both which reduce the capacity of soils to absorb water, recharge ground water and thus increase seasonal flooding. Pollution and drought destroy the flamingos' food, Cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, and causing them to migrate to the nearby Lakes, more recently lakes Elmenteita, Simbi Nyaima and Bogoria. Local climate changes have also been hypothesized to contribute to the changing environmental conditions in the lakes catchment. Recent media reports indicate increasing concern among stakeholders, as mass flamingo migrations and deaths could spell doom to the tourism industry.\n\nThe flamingos feed on algae, created from their droppings mixing in the warm alkaline waters, and plankton. But flamingo are not the only avian attraction, also present are two large fish eating birds, pelicans and cormorants. Despite the tepid and alkaline waters, a diminutive fish, \"Alcolapia grahami\" has flourished after being introduced in the early 1960s. The lake is rich in other bird life. There are over 400 resident species on the lake and in the surrounding park. Thousands of both little grebes and white winged black terns are frequently seen as are stilts, avocets, ducks, and in the European winter the migrant waders.\n\nZooplankton: The monogonont rotifer species \"Brachionus sp.\" Austria (belonging to the \"Brachionus plicatilis\" cryptic species complex) occurs in the lake.\n\n\n\"(listed alphabetically)\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2061417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061417", "title": "Dubai Metro", "text": "Dubai Metro\n\nThe Dubai Metro is a rapid transit rail network in the city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The Red Line and Green Line are operational, with one more line being constructed. These first two lines run underground in the city center and on elevated viaducts elsewhere (elevated railway). All trains are fully automated and driverless, and, together with stations, are air conditioned with platform edge doors. Architecture firm Aedas designed the metro's 45 stations, two depots and operational control centers. The Al Ghurair Investment group were the metro's builders.\n\nThe first section of the Red Line, covering 10 stations, was ceremonially inaugurated at 9:09:09 pm on 9 September 2009, by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Ruler of Dubai, with the line opening to the public at 6 am (UTC 04:00) on 10 September. The Dubai Metro is the first urban train network in the Arabian Peninsula and either the second in the Arab World (after the Cairo Metro) or the third (if the surface-level, limited-service Baghdad Metro is counted). A major expansion of the Red Line to add 15 kilometers of track and extend it from Ibn Battuta to the Expo 2020 site was announced in April 2015. The extension will increase 7 metro stations.\n\nMore than 110,000 people, or nearly 10 percent of Dubai's population, used the Metro in its first two days of operation. The Dubai Metro carried 10 million passengers from launch on 9 September 2009 to 9 February 2010 with 11 stations operational on the Red Line. Engineering consultancy Atkins provided full multidisciplinary design and management of the civil works on Dubai Metro.\n\nUntil 2016, the Dubai Metro was the world's longest driverless metro network with a route length of , as recognized by Guinness World Records in 2012. However, its total route length have since been surpassed by the fully automated driverless Vancouver SkyTrain and Singapore MRT. Nevertheless, the Red Line, at , remains the world's longest driverless single metro line.\n\nPlanning of the Dubai Metro began under the directive of Dubai's Ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who expected other projects to attract 15 million visitors to Dubai by 2010. The combination of a rapidly growing population (expected to reach 3 million by 2017) and severe traffic congestion necessitated the building of an urban rail system to provide additional public transportation capacity, relieve motor traffic, and provide infrastructure for additional development.\n\nIn May 2005, a AED 12.45 billion/US$3.4 billion design and build contract was awarded to the Dubai Rail Link (DURL) consortium made up of Japanese companies including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Corporation, Obayashi Corporation, Kajima Corporation and Turkish firm Yapı Merkezi, and the Project Management ('The Engineer') and Construction Management services contract awarded to a French-American joint venture between Systra and Parsons Corporation. The first phase (worth AED 15.5 billion/US$4.2 billion) covers of the proposed network, including the Red Line between Al Rashidiya and the Jebel Ali Free Zone set for completion by September 2009 and the Green Line from Al Qusais 2 to Al Jaddaf 1. This was to be completed by June 2010. A second phase contract was subsequently signed in July 2006 and includes extensions to the initial routes. The Red Line partially opened at 9 minutes and 9 seconds past 9 pm on 9 September 2009 (9/9/9 9:9:9), inaugurated by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.\n\nThe construction cost of the Dubai Metro project has shot up by about 80 per cent from the original AED 15.5 billion/US$4.2 billion to AED 28 billion/US$7.8 billion. The authorities contradicted this, saying that the cost of the project did not overshoot. They attributed the increase in expenditure to the major changes in the scope and design of the project. The authorities also expect to generate AED 18 billion/US$4.9 billion in income over the next 10 years; but they speculate that the Metro would not be a profit-making enterprise, since the fares would be subsidized.\n\nWork officially commenced on the construction of the metro on 21 March 2006. In February 2009, a top RTA Rail Agency official said the US$4.2 billion Dubai Metro project would be completed on schedule despite the global crisis. However, only 10 out of 29 metro stations of the red line opened on 9 September 2009.\n\nConstruction of the 18 stations on the red line and another 18 on the green line restarted on 7 February 2010, according to contractors, after a settlement was reached with a Japanese-led consortium over disputed payments of about US$2 billion-US$3 billion. Construction of all 29 metro stations on the Red Line was declared complete on 28 April 2010 by the acting chief of the RTA Rail Agency.\n\nSeven more stations on the Dubai Metro Red Line opened on 30 April 2010. Ten new trains were pressed into service, giving a total of 22 trains in service when the stations opened. The seven stations are, Emirates Station, Airport Terminal 1 Station, Dubai Internet City (TECOM) Station, Al Karama Station (now ADCB), Emirates Towers Station, Dubai Marina Station (now Damac Properties) and Ibn Battuta Station. In addition to this, a further three stations were opened on 15 May 2010; GGICO Station and World Trade Center Station. Furthermore, Business Bay Station, First Gulf Bank Station (Now First Abu Dhabi Bank), Sharaf DG (Al Barsha) Station, Nakheel (Emirates Golf Club) Station and Jumeirah Lakes Towers Station (Now DMCC) were opened on 15 October 2010. After much delay, Jebel Ali Station, the terminus of the Red Line on the Abu Dhabi side was opened on 11 March 2011, and Jebel Ali Industrial Station, renamed Danube Station, was opened on 12 December 2012. The final two stations, Al Jadaf and Creek, on the Green Line were opened on 1 March 2014.\n\nThe Dubai Metro is operated by Serco under contract to the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority.\n\nRed Line trains run every 5 to 6 minutes off-peak (averaging 8.5 trains per hour), with a minimum headway of 3 minutes 45 seconds (16 trains per hour) during peak hours, with 44 trainsets in service. From 2010, when 51 trains were in service, the line had a peak-hour capacity of 11,675 passengers per hour in each direction. , the Red Line operates 60 trains (train registrations 5001-5045, 5065-5079) The theoretical maximum design capacity is 25,720 passengers per hour, which would require 106 trains.\n\nThe Green Line had an initial capacity of 6,395 passengers per hour per direction, with 19 trains (train registrations 5046-5064) in service as of September 2014. The design capacity of this route is put at 13,380 passengers per hour with 60 trains in service.\n\nOver 280,000 passengers used the Dubai Metro during the first week of its operation.\n\nBefore launch, Dubai Municipality Public Transport Department expected the metro to provide transport for 12% of all trips in Dubai. After the first month of operation (on a limited network), the monthly total was 1,740,578 passengers, which equates to under 60,000 passengers/day. After the opening of more stations in May 2010, ridership surged to 103,002 passengers/day and reached 130,000/day by the beginning of October 2010. When the Green Line opened on 9 September 2011, passengers on the Red Line was noted as 180,000/day. In 2013, passengers rose to 377,000/day, split 64% for the Red line and 36% for the Green Line. During the first half of 2015, RTA announced that 88,252,034 passengers have used the metro. In August 2017, RTA announced that total ridership since 2009 had surpassed 1 billion total trips.\nOne issue for the new system was how to reliably and comfortably get riders to their final destination if it is not located near a metro station. The RTA has added \"feeder bus routes\" which act as shuttle services to and from major locations in and around the station area. There are bus and taxi laybys constructed as well as drop off zones at each station for ease of passenger access.\n\nIn addition 268 km of light rail lines are also planned, these will serve as feeders to the Dubai Metro. The Dubai Tram is one of the light rail plans.\n\nThe first two lines of the Dubai Metro have of lines, and 47 stations (nine of them being underground). The red line stretches along the city from the Jebel Ali area to the border with Sharjah. It passes through several tourist attractions such as Mall of the Emirates, The Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa. The green line, on the other hand, stays within the old Dubai area. It passes through many historical sites, such as the Dubai Museum, the Gold Souk, the Spice Souk among others. Because of that, many stations near those places are themed on the history of Dubai, with photos depicting the UAE in the 1960s or earlier being on display within the station. Some stations are even specially designed with the architecture of traditional Emirati houses, mirroring the architecture in the surrounding area.\n\nRoute 2020: A 15 kilometre (9 mi) extension with 7 new stations (including 2 underground) being built which will start at Nakheel Harbour and Tower station and will end at the Expo 2020 site. Future plans will also extend this line to Al Maktoum International Airport. The extension will be served by new, redesigned trains.\n\nIn 2011, the RTA stated that there are no \"immediate plans\" to build the Blue and Purple lines \"in the next five or six years\".\n\nIn 2013, the RTA laid out a three phase plan to expand the existing lines and build new ones: extending the Green Line by 12 stations and to Academic City by 2020; expanding the overall system by 58 stations and by 2025 and completing expansion with a total of 69 stations and 221 km over and above the present 47 stations and that are present as of January 2013.\n\n\nIn 2014, the RTA approved the recent proposal of extending the red line from Al Rashidiya station to Mirdif City Center which will increase 3.5 kilometer with the new station. However, there is also a proposal to extend it further to Al Warqa’a which is currently being studied.\n\nOn the green line, the RTA has finalized the extension plan of 20.6 kilometer from Al Jaddaf to Academic City. The extension will go through Festival City, Lagoons, Ras Al Khor Industrial Area, International City, Silicon Oasis and Dubai Academic City.\n\nDubai Metro is composed of at-grade (G) elevated Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 (T1, T2 and T3, respectively) underground stations (U) and underground transfer station types (UT). Type 1 is the regular at-grade concourse station, Type 2 is a regular elevated concourse station, and Type 3 is an elevated special track station with an extra track to hold a non operational train. Underground transfer stations will be accommodating both the Red and Green lines for easy transfers.\n\nBesides these differences, there are five themes used in the interiors of the stations:\nThe Earth stations have a tan-brown colour effects; water has blue-white colour effects; fire has orange-red colour effects; and the air has green colour effects.\n\nOfficials have negotiated with international and local companies over naming rights for 23 stations on the two lines. This corporate branding is the first of its kind. Some examples are: BurJuman, Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall, Mall of the Emirates, DAMAC Properties and UAE Exchange.\n\nThe Dubai Metro has built three large multi-level car parking with an estimated capacity to accommodate more than 8,000 vehicles for the passengers where they can park their car and ride the metro. \n\n<br>The parking is free for the metro users.\n\nAll metro stations have elevators and contrasting tactile guidance path to guide the visually impaired. There are also dedicated spaces for wheelchair users on all the trains. Handicapped passengers, also known as 'people of determination' in the UAE, can ride with any RTA service for free with a special, personalized Nol Card.\n\nEmergency stop buttons, intercoms and platform screen doors with corresponding flashing light signals are installed at every station for the safety of the passengers. Trains are equipped with emergency stop buttons, door release levers, intercoms and fire extinguishers. CCTV is operational throughout the entire network and in trains and police officers are regularly on patrol in the stations, especially during rush hours.\n\nWi-Fi connectivity is available across all trains and stations which and is provided by \"du\" which is in par with the Wi-Fi UAE program which provides Wi-Fi connectivity across major parts of UAE. Mobile phone coverage is available across the entire network of the metro. The metros itself has Wi-Fi connectivity inside for the commuters to access with 2 tiers of internet access with the normal service being free whereas the premium service can be accessed by a nominal fee.\n\nOn 11 November 2014 onward, the Dubai Tram integrated with Dubai Metro at Damac Properties and DMCC stations. Footbridges are connected and provide a direct link between the two adjacent tram and metro stations for a smooth and seamless interchange for passengers between the two systems.\n\nThe Dubai Transport is divided into 4 tiers (5 zones). The prices were slightly increased as of 11 November 2014. The cheapest ticket (not preloaded, and not in the \"gold\" class) with distance not more than 3 km cost 3 AED (about $1.32) - equivalent of Tier 0, and most costly single trip (Tier 3, exceed 2 zones, and paper not preloaded ticket also) 7.5 AED (about $2.04) and was not increased from opening. Dubai Metro fares are among the cheapest in the world. Tier 1 is one zone trip, where the travel exceeds 3 km, Tier 2 is neighboring 2 zones travel. Also (excluding Gold class) using cards there is \"no more paying\" - a free rest of day travel if cost exceeds 14 AED (about $6.18).\n\nThe Dubai Metro has a fixed fare based on 3 tiers. The tiers are\nThe Nol Card are used by the passengers to check-in and check-out at the gates in their destination station. No other payment form (cash, credit card) can be used. The fare will be automatically deducted based on the number of zones traveled. Passengers will be allowed to check-in when their card has more than minimum credit required.\n\nChildren below the age of 5 years or less than 90 cm and people with disabilities (personalized Nol Card required) will be eligible to travel the metro for free.\n\nThere is also a Nol Card available for students & seniors, and they can get a student & senior citizens' discount.\n\nJapanese manufacturer Kinki Sharyo built a total of 79 five-car trains (60 on Red Line, 19 on Green Line). They are designed to carry 643 seated and standing passengers, and unusually for a mass transit system, the trains have three classes of accommodation: Gold Class (first class), Women and Children class (a classification that is extended to a greater number of cars during the peak hours), and regular Silver Class (economy). The first train (5001) was delivered to Dubai in March 2008. The metro has driver less operation and uses third rail current collection. Trained wardens accompany passengers to help with emergencies. The four newer trains (5074, 5075, 5076, and 5077) are each painted with a different special livery, in which one of them (train 5077) representing the skyline of Dubai.\n\n50 new trains, manufactured by Alstom, will be introduced to the system starting from November 2018. The trains have higher seat capacity, 696 seats, up from 643 seats on the current trains. This will increase passenger capacity by about 10%. The new trains have a refreshed interior with better air conditioning, digital maps, improved speed, brakes and doors. Out of these 50 trains, 35 will run on the red and green lines while the remaining 15 will run on Route 2020, scheduled to open by the end of 2019.\n\nBecause of the Dubai metro, RTA claimed that 343,000 tonnes of carbon emissions were avoided in 2017. This occurred because passengers reduced the use of cars and prevented the burning of fuel.\n\nOn 1 November 2018, as part of the RTA's Public Transport Day, the longest diverse human chain of hand was formed in a Dubai metro train at Etisalat station. The record was acknowledged by Guinness World Records. The chain was formed by people from 96 countries around the whole world. Previously this record was with Norway where 75 nations made a diverse human chain.\n\nTo permit fully automated operation, Thales Rail Signalling Solutions is supplying its SelTrac IS communications-based train control and NetTrac central control technology. This is configured for a minimum headway of 90 seconds (40 trains per hour). The top speed of the trains is estimated to be around 95 km/h (59 mph), giving a round-trip time of 2 hours 23 minutes for the Red Line and 1 hour 23 minutes for the Green Line.\n\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, gave his directions to transform Dubai Metro stations into art museums under the supervision of Dubai Culture and Arts Authority, The project was announced early April 2014 and aims at displaying contemporary and modern art.\n\n\n"}

A number of adjacent ranges lie to the east: the Engineer Range, the Raglan Range, the Eldon Range, and the Sticht Range but in most cases these are on a west–east alignment, while the West Coast Range runs in a north–south direction, following the Mount Read volcanic arc.\n\nThe range has encompassed multiple land uses including the catchment area for Hydro Tasmania dams, mines, transport routes and historical sites. Of the communities that have existed actually in the range itself, Gormanston, is probably the last to remain.\n\nThese are determined by a number of factors - the southerly direction of glaciation in the King River Valley and around the Tyndalls; as well as the general north -south orientation of the West Coast Range itself.\n\nThe following mountains are contained within the West Coast Range, including sub-ranges without a specifically named peak and also including subsidiary peaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe slopes of Mount Owen, Mount Lyell and Mount Sedgwick are covered in stumps of forest trees killed by fires and smelter fumes from the earlier part of the twentieth century. The devastation of forests close to the mining operations at Queenstown was substantial as early as the 1890s and continued late into the twentieth century.\n\nSome Huon Pine on the slopes of Mount Read have been found that show considerable age.\n\nDue to fire, mining and a range of human activities the vegetation zones along the West Coast range can be considered to be mainly modified, and few pockets of vegetation could be considered unchanged since European presence.\n\nThe eastern side of the range is on the western boundary of the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, and at these points the forests are in better condition.\n\nForestry conservation zones exist along its length in accordance with the Regional Forestry Agreement (RFA).\n\nIn the average winter the \"1,000 metre snowline\" sees most of the mountains with snow. In previous decades, Lake Margaret was the main long-term weather-reporting location, however the Mount Read automatic weather station now maintains extremes regularly reported on the Bureau of Meteorology website for extreme conditions. The rainfall records of Lake Margaret were on a par with Tully in Queensland for the highest rainfall in Australia. Approximations for the West Coast Range are made at 2800–3000 mm precipitation per year.\n\nThe prevailing weather is due to the location of the West Coast. It has no landmass shielding it from the Southern Ocean or Antarctic weather, and being in the Roaring Forties cold fronts and extreme weather are regular occurrences on the West Coast. The Cape Sorell Waverider Buoy which was initiated by the BOM in 1998 (there had been earlier testing buoys in the early 1990s) has given good indications of the behaviour of ocean swells to correlate with weather conditions.\n\nEarlier weather records were kept for Queenstown and Zeehan. Due to change in population distribution and resources in the west coast, the main weather data is currently from Strahan Airport and Mount Read.\n\nThe following BOM recorded locations are relevant to West Coast Range:\n\nEarly European exploration of the range was made by explorers, and by convicts escaping from Macquarie Harbour Penal Station on Sarah Island. Most occurred in the late nineteenth century, but as late as the 1940s some government maps had \"unexplored\" or \"insufficient survey\" or words to that effect.\n\nOf the mountains that are viewable from Macquarie Harbour - most were names associated with the proponents for and against the ideas that Charles Darwin was putting forward in the late 19th century.\n\nThomas Bather Moore named Darwin, Geikie and Read and the Tyndall Range. Charles Gould named 1860 between 1862 Murchison, Sedgwick, Lyell and Owen; Huxley and Jukes were named later.\n\nThere were very small mining settlements in the Tyndalls, on Mount Darwin and Mount Jukes, and possibly very small camps of short duration in other locations. Linda in the Linda Valley is probably the only other remaining named location with population in a valley in the range. Queenstown lies in the Queen River valley on the western slopes of Mount Owen, or south western slopes of Mount Lyell, and is in effect 'out' of the range.\n\nThe Tasmanian Mines Department (in its various names over the last hundred years) has had guides to the minerals found in Tasmania - most are found in the West Coast region, these include \nBarium, Copper, Gold, Pyrites, Silver, Zinc.\n\nMining sites, in most cases short-lived exist on the upper regions of Mount Darwin, and Mount Jukes. Longer lasting mines existed on the middle slopes of Mount Lyell (North, West and South sides), and on the middle and upper slopes of Mount Read. \nMineral exploration has occurred on the slopes of almost all of the named mountains over time. \nConservation measures in recent decades have put special restrictions on the activity so as to not replicate the damage of the Mount Lyell operation. A good example of the capacity to mine in a sensitive area is the Henty Gold Mine, at the northern end of the range.\n\nSee also West Coast Tasmania Mines for mines that occur on the West Coast Range - and in the West Coast region.\n\nThe West Coast of Tasmania was always attractive to plans for dams for hydro electricity. The King River was surveyed for this at the time of the First World War.\n\nThen in the 1950s and early 1960s the early HEC surveys were conducted. The upper part of the Pieman scheme dammed parts of the West Coast Range, and the final major projects of the HEC dam making project were the Henty and King River Schemes.\n\nThe Pieman River Power Scheme involved the damming of rivers that start in the West Coast Range. It was the scheme that followed the Gordon River Scheme - and was to be followed by the Franklin River Scheme - but in reality was followed by the King River and Henty River schemes instead.\n\nConstruction commenced in 1974 and the scheme was completed by 1987. It involved dams on the Murchison and Macintosh rivers, as well as the Pieman River. The main construction town and administrative centre for the Hydro was at Tullah.\n\nThe Mackintosh Dam and power station were north of Tullah, while the Murchsion Dam and Lake were south. A third dam - the Bastyan Dam was just north of Rosebery, while the Reece Dam was a long way to the west - close to the town of Corinna.\n\nThe Crotty Dam is an 82 metre high Hydro Tasmania dam on the King River between Mount Huxley and Mount Jukes. The Darwin Dam is a saddle dam at the foot of Mount Darwin. Both of the dams contain the 54 square kilometre Lake Burbury water storage area.\n\nInitial access to the west coast region was by foot or by access from the sea - railways progressed further into the region much earlier than roads - the road from Hobart was not connected until the 1930s and the north coast until the 1960s.\n\nTo support the Mount Lyell and North Mount Lyell mines, railways were built from ports on Macquarie Harbour and travelled to the edge of the Range. They did not traverse the range.\n\n\nSimilarly the lines that connected with the Emu Bay Railway - the North East Dundas Tramway for example, did not traverse the range, but travelled to the foot of the mountains where the mines were active.\n\nThe Lyell Highway connection running through the West Coast range at the Linda Valley was not constructed until the 1930s.\n\nThe road to Crotty from Queenstown (or more correctly the locality of Lynchford), built as the \"Mount Jukes Road\" by the Hydro as part of the King River dam scheme in the 1980s passed high above the King River Gorge on the northern side of Mount Jukes.\n\nThe Anthony Road constructed by the Hydro during the construction of the Anthony Power Scheme also cuts through the northern part of the range, as well as access to the glacial lakes in The Tyndalls - Lake Westwood, Lake Selina and Lake Julia.\n\nAlthough not currently serviced as a registered aerodrome the Queenstown airport (in operation in the 1960s and 1970s) just west of the townsite is the closest air service facility. Strahan Airport is the closest registered airport.\n\nThere have been a significant number of temporary helicopter landing sites throughout the range used by Hydro Tasmania and mineral exploration activities - but no inventory is known of these locations.\n\nTramways and Railways\nthrough the Crotty and Darwin townsites to Pillinger and Kelly Basin.\n\nTownsites\n\nMine sites\n\nHydro sites\n\nMain Roads\n\nA major mapping of the region of the range was conducted between 1986 and 1993\n\n\n\n\n"}

Currently, the national park is encircled by the forest reserve. In April 1978, the area was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Combined, the national park and forest reserve became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.\n\nThe Government of Kenya had four reasons for creating a national park on and around Mount Kenya. These were the importance of tourism for the local and national economies, to preserve an area of great scenic beauty, to conserve the biodiversity within the park, and to preserve the water-catchment for the surrounding area.\n\nThe national park has an area of , most of which is above the contour line. The forest reserve has an area of . Combined, this makes the area of the UNESCO World Heritage Site .\n\nVolcanic sediment in the surrounding region's soil and the huge volume of fresh water coming down the slopes makes the area particularly favorable for agriculture.\n\nA small portion of this park's borders near heavy populations have electrified fences to keep the elephants out of the surrounding farmland. At lower altitudes, black-and-white colobus and other monkeys, and Cape buffaloes are prevalent. In 1993, a huge male lion weighing was shot near the mountain.\n\n\n"}

It was broadcast from 9 a.m. to noon, Monday to Friday. The series replaced a series of short-lived morning radio programs that aired in this slot after \"This Country in the Morning\" ended in 1974.\n\nThe show was created by Krista Mäeots who served as its executive producer until her death in 1978. She had formerly been a producer with \"This Country in the Morning\". The show debuted with Harry Brown and Maxine Crook as co-hosts. In September 1977, Don Harron became host of the show. But the program was most associated with legendary Canadian broadcaster Peter Gzowski, who assumed the host's chair in 1982. The program was a mixture of news and human interest interviews. Shelagh Rogers and Stuart McLean were frequent guest hosts in later years.\n\nIn 1993, following the cancellation of CBC's \"Prime Time\", \"Morningside\" added a prime time edition which replayed selected segments from that morning's broadcast. \n\n\"Morningside\" has proven to be one of the most successful radio programs in CBC history. Among the regular contributors was producer and comedian Stuart McLean, who also had a summer time segment on the show called \"The Vinyl Cafe\", which eventually was spun-off to become a regular separate program on CBC Radio for decades.\n\nWhen Gzowski retired, \"Morningside\" and the network's Sunday public affairs show \"Sunday Morning\" were replaced by \"This Morning\", which was hosted in its first year by Michael Enright and Avril Benoit.\n\nGzowski hosted the last episode of \"Morningside\" from the Temple Gardens Mineral Spa Resort in Moose Jaw. The resort named its café the Morningside Café in honour of the last broadcast.\n\nDuring Harron's tenure, the opening theme was \"Jogging Along\" by John Arpin. \"Blue Skies\" composed by Irving Berlin was used as the closing theme. The theme for Gzowski's tenure was \"Morningside theme\" composed by David W. Thompson. The closing theme was \"Happiness\" by Sandro Carlo Camerin (Reel to Reel).\n\n"}

It is defined by a main arterial Morningside Road, an ancient route from the city to the south west of Scotland and Carlisle, and is centred on the lowest, southernmost point on the road at Morningside Cross, at which point the route used to ford the Jordan Burn, now redirected underground at this point. It lies south of Bruntsfield, Burghmuirhead (including Holy Corner, Church Hill, and Greenhill); south-west of Marchmont, and south-east of Merchiston; and to the north of Comiston and the Braid Hills.\n\nThe Morningside Clock was originally in the middle of the roadway as the clock for users of (now-closed) Morningside Station (part of the suburban railway line), and a match for the clock at nearby Tollcross. \n\nThe Canny Man's on the corner of Canaan Lane (formerly The Volunteer's Arms, named for users of a nearby rifle range), is an elaborately and eccentrically decorated historic bar, restaurant and inn. \n\nThe Bore Stane, an ancient monument, is embedded above the pavement adjacent to the former Parish Church at the corner of Morningside Road and Newbattle Terrace. The Royal Standard of James IV was pitched at this standing stone for the muster of the Scottish Army on the Burgh Muir (moor) before the Battle of Flodden in 1513.\n\nThe Hanging Stanes, embedded in the surface of Braid Road (at NT 2451 7061), formed the foundation of a scaffold specifically erected for the hanging of Thomas Kelly and Henry O'Neill on 25th January 1815, thought to be the last public execution for highway robbery in Scotland. The hanging took place at the scene of the crime.\n\nThe Eric Liddell Centre, named after the 1924 Olympic 400m gold medalist athlete, Eric Liddell, is in the former North Morningside Parish Church at Holy Corner, at the extreme north of Morningside.\n\nThe Church Hill Theatre sits at the crest of the brae leading down to Morningside Cross, just south of Holy Corner. \n\nThe independent Streamline Moderne Dominion Cinema (first opened 1938) is located on Newbattle Terrace.\n\nThe names of several streets in the area have biblical associations, such as Eden Lane, Nile Grove, Jordan Lane, and Canaan Lane. The Jordan Burn is a stream which trickles out of sight at a spot next to the former Post Office in Morningside Road. Several theories exist for the origins of these names, ranging from Jews settling in the area at one time to Cromwell's troops inventing place names while foraging in unfamiliar territory. However, Charles Smith, in his noted history of the area, indicates from historical sources the likely presence of Gypsies on the Burgh Muir in the 16th century and the existence of an Egypt Farm, first mentioned in 1585, which may have been a reminder of their presence. It was demolished in the 1890s.\n\nAnother early street name of note is Cuddy Lane (\"cuddy\" is a Scots word for a donkey or short, thick, strong horse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fiction, Morningside is the home of Muriel Spark's Jean Brodie, and in children's literature it is the home of \"Maisie from Morningside\", a kitten in books by Aileen Paterson, who adorns all Lothian Bus number 5 buses which serve the area.\n\nMost of the housing on Morningside Road is of tenement style, with surrounding streets housing mostly Victorian villas (detached or semi-detached houses), plus a number of notable older buildings, such as one-storey farmer's cottages. Exceptions are the streets around Falcon Avenue and Falcon Road West which are also tenemented. The names of these streets recall one of the largest local mansion houses, Falcon Hall, now gone, though its main entrance gates can still be seen at the entrace to Edinburgh Zoo.\n\nCivic amenities include South Morningside Primary School; Saint Peter's R.C. Primary School; Blackford Pond; and Morningside Library. There are a wide range of small, traditional shops, cafés and restaurants as well as some more mainstream shops and supermarkets such as Waitrose and Marks & Spencer; and there is an independent, family-run cinema, The Dominion.\n\nChurches in the area include Morningside United Church (Church of Scotland and United Reformed Church), Christ Church (Scottish Episcopal Church) and Elim Church, all at Holy Corner; Morningside Parish Church in Cluny Gardens; Roman Catholic St Peter's Church and the Old Schoolhouse Christian Fellowship (independent). The former North Morningside Parish church at Holy Corner was converted for community use in 1980 and is now called the Eric Liddell Centre after the Olympic athlete who lived locally and attended the former Morningside Congregational Church, now the home of Morningside United Church.\n\nThe area is served by a number of buses operated by Lothian Buses including route numbers 5, 11, 15, 16, 23, 36, 38 & 41.\n\nThe disused Morningside Road railway station was closed to passenger service in 1962 when the Edinburgh Suburban and Southside Junction Railway service was withdrawn. A local pressure group is campaigning for the station to be re-opened, possibly as an extension to the Edinburgh tram system.\n\n"}
{"id": "2061457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061457", "title": "Artaxias I", "text": "Artaxias I\n\nArtaxias I (from ; in \"Artašēs\"; Old Iranian: \"Artaxšaθra\") was the founder of the Artaxiad dynasty of Armenia, ruling from 189 BC to 160 BC. He was succeeded by his son Artavasdes I.\n\n\"Artaxias\" is the Greek form of the Armenian \"Artašēs\", itself from the Old Iranian name \"*Artaxšaθra-\" (), equivalent to Greek \"Artaxérxēs\" (). The name means \"whose reign is through truth (asha)\".\n\nAccording to the Greek geographer Strabo, Artaxias and Zariadres were Macedonian generals of the Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great (). He adds that after Antiochus III's defeat by the Romans in 188 BC, the two generals established themselves a kingdom in Greater Armenia. However, this statement has been dismissed by the recent discovery of boundary stones with Aramaic engravings in Armenia, which mentions Artaxias' proclamation of being \"the son of Zareh (Zariadres)\" and an \"Eruandid (Orontid) king\".\n\nThe ending of \"-akān\" in the engravings, originally used in Old Persian, was extensively used in the Parthian ostraca from Nisa and in later Armenian texts. Anahit Perikhanian thus confirms that both Artaxias and Zariadres, \"far from being Macedonians, belonged in fact to the earlier native dynasty, albeit probably to collateral branches, and that the Eruandids, or Artaxiad/Artašēsids as they came to be known, with their Iranian antecedents, continued to rule Armenia as before.\" In the same manner of that of the monarchs of Pontus and Cappadocia, the Artaxiads stuck mainly to the royal traditions used by the former Achaemenid Empire. At the same time Greek influence was starting to advance in the country.\n\nArtaxias and Zariadres united their armies to expand their dominions; the kingdom of Artaxias, originally centered around the middle of the Araxes river, expanded into Iberian land, and especially the territory of Media Atropatene, which lost its territories at the Caspian Sea and the districts of Syunik and Vaspurakan. Meanwhile, Zariadres conquered Acilisene and Taron. The conquered peoples of the territories likewise also spoke Armenian, however imperial Aramaic (with a largely strong amalgamation of Persian words) was still the language of the government and the court, a practice derived from the Achaemenid Empire. According to the 5th-century CE Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, Artaxias ordered the delimitation of villages and farmland, which has been confirmed by archaeological sites in Armenia. Artaxias used many epithets, one of them being the unidentified Persian word of ʾxšhsrt.\nArtaxias founded the city of Artaxata (Middle Persian: \"Artaxšas-šāt\", \"joy of arta\") on the left side of the Araxes river, which would serve as the capital and seat of the Armenian monarchy until the 2nd-century CE. It is unlikely that the former Carthaginian commander Hannibal took refuge at the Armenian court and played a role in the establishment of the city. In 165/4 BC, Artaxias suffered a defeat to the forces of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes (), who had him captured. Nevertheless, in 161/0 BC, Artaxias managed to help the satrap of Media, Timarchus, who rebelled against Seleucid rule. Artaxias died in 160 BC, and was succeeded by his son Artavasdes I.\n\nDissimilar to their predecessors, the Orontids, the majority of the Artaxiad rulers minted coins. The reverse of the early Artaxiad coin typically shows an eagle standing on a mountain-top, which is presumably Mount Ararat. The eagle, which also appears on the Artaxiad crown, is a portrayal of the Iranian \"xᵛarənah\" (\"glory\"), which was seen amongst the Iranians as a symbol that defended the legitimate monarch and his kingdom, even after his death.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Artaxias II had two siblings: a younger brother called Tigranes III and an unnamed sister who possibly married King Archelaus of Cappadocia. He was born and raised in Armenia.\n\nArtaxias II ascended to the Armenian throne in 34 BC as he regained the throne lost by his father. The Roman Triumvir Mark Antony, had captured Artavasdes II with his family, who were then taken as political prisoners to Alexandria where Artavasdes II was later executed on the orders of Cleopatra VII of Egypt. Artaxias II managed to escape and fled to King Phraates IV of Parthia. Phraates IV invaded Armenia and placed Artaxias II on the throne. As a result, Artaxias II was pro-Parthian and anti-Roman. With the support of Phraates IV, Artaxias II was successful in a military campaign against Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene, a former enemy of Artavasdes II. \n\nArtaxias II was said to be spiteful and vengeful. He massacred the remaining Roman garrison and slaughtered all the Roman traders in Armenia. A possible consequence of this action, when Artaxias II sent emissaries in Rome to try to secure the release of his family then in Roman captivity and the Roman emperor Augustus refused Artaxias II's request. \n\nArtaxias II proved to be an unpopular leader with his people. As the Armenians lost faith in their ruling monarch, they sent messengers to Augustus requesting him to remove Artaxias II from his throne and to install his brother, Tigranes III as his successor. By 20 BC, Tigranes III had lived in Rome for 10 years. Augustus agreed to the request from the Armenians. Augustus sent his step-son Tiberius, with Tigranes III and a large army to depose Artaxias II. Before Tiberius and Tigranes III arrived in Armenia, a cabal within the palace was successful in murdering Artaxias II. The Romans installed Tigranes III as the new king of Armenia unopposed.\n\n"}

After his death, his mother and Polemon II moved back to Pontus.\n\nFrom his early childhood, Artaxias enjoyed copying the customs, clothes, also loved hunting and feasting, along with other pastimes associated with the Armenians. In 18, the previous Armenian King was exiled and Artaxias became popular and in favor with the Armenians. His mother's maternal first cousin, the general Germanicus, with the approval of the Roman emperor Tiberius, was in agreement with the local aristocracy, and crowned Artaxias as the new Roman client king of Armenia.\n\nArmenians paid homage to him and acclaimed him as King Artaxias.

In 1843 the C&GWU had been taken over by the Great Western Railway which began putting pressure on the Bristol and Gloucester to join the GWR at Bristol, to subscribe to the proposed South Devon Railway, and to convert to broad gauge track, to the alarm of the Northern \"narrow\" gauge railways.\n\nThe \"break-of-gauge\" at Gloucester was a major problem. It caused pandemonium as whole trainloads of passengers, and their luggage, changed from one to another, together with the transshipment of goods.\n\nParliament had established a commission to examine the problem and there was a consensus that the track should be unified throughout the line. The GWR made an offer to the Birmingham and Bristol directors. The latter's shareholders held out for more, and the GWR deferred its decision for three days. At this moment the Midland Railway made its move.\n\nTrue or not, the story of how it came about is a part of railway legend, when the Midland's John Ellis was travelling, quite by chance it is said, in a train with two Bristol & Gloucester directors. He overheard them discussing the matter, and took it on himself to offer better terms.\n\nIn 1846, the Bristol and Birmingham and Midland Railways Act allowed the lines to merge and become part of the Midland Railway. The bill was managed by Samuel Carter, who was solicitor to both Midland and LNWR.\n\nThe LNWR was also alarmed at the idea of the GWR's broad gauge reaching the Midlands and it offered to share any losses the Midland might incur. In the event, all that was needed was a nominal rent for the Midland's use of the LNWR's Birmingham New Street station.\n\nThere were, of course, still problems with gauge. In 1848 the Midland built its own line into Gloucester, avoiding the GWR ex-Cheltenham & Great Western Union line, and laid mixed gauge to Bristol. By 1857 the whole line had been converted to standard gauge.\n\n"}

This was the site of the Māori fortress of Te Puia, first occupied around 1325, and known as an impenetrable stronghold never taken in battle. Māori have lived here ever since, taking full advantage of the geothermal activity in the valley for heating and cooking.\nWhakarewarewa has some 500 pools, most of which are alkaline chloride hot springs, and at least 65 geyser vents, each with their own name. Seven geysers are currently active. Pohutu Geyser, meaning big splash or explosion, erupts approximately hourly to heights of up to .\n\nMany of the thermal features at Whakarewarewa have been adversely affected by Rotorua residents taking advantage of the underlying geothermal fluids of the city by drawing shallow wells ( deep) to extract hot water for both domestic and commercial heating. A bore closure programme in 1987–1988 resulted in 106 wells within of Pohutu Geyser being cemented shut, with another 120 wells outside the radius being shut due to a punitive royalty charging regime. There has subsequently been a pronounced recovery in the geysers and hot springs at Whakarewarewa.\n\nThe area features Te Pākira Marae and Wahiao meeting house, a meeting place of the Tūhourangi hapū of Ngāti Puta, Ngāti Uruhina, Ngāti Wahiao, Tūhourangi and Ngāti Taoi.\n\nMost of the currently active geysers at Whakarewarewa are located on Geyser Flat and aligned on a common fissure. This is a highly complex system, with the activity of one geyser affecting another.\n\nKereru Geyser, about above Puarenga Stream, located at the head of a small apron of blackish sinter, erupts every few days or weeks, in a fan-shaped jet high. No large eruptions occurred between 1972–1988, and it seems its recovery was directly linked to the sudden reduction of well drawoff in 1987. Kereru Geyser is probably independent of other springs on the fissure.\nPrince of Wales Feathers Geyser, Pohutu Geyser, Te Horu Geyser (The Cauldron) and Waikorohihi Geyser are on a sinter plateau about above Puarenga Stream. Prince of Wales Feathers Geyser, Pohutu Geyser's closest neighbour, always precedes Pohutu, a feeble jet at first but gradually increasing in power until a continuous column is ejected at an angle, when Pohutu usually erupts also. Sometimes Waikorohihi Geyser erupts a discontinuous jet, then Prince of Wales Feathers will commence, later followed by Pohutu.\n\nUntil 1972, Te Horu Geyser erupted high as often as 10–15 times each day, but after that time eruptions and even boiling ceased. The water in Te Horu's vent began to overflow again in 1998. A very direct connection exists between Te Horu and Pohutu, with air-cooled water erupted from Pohutu largely falling in Te Horu's vent. This may explain the popular belief that Pohutu is more active when there is a south wind, because most erupted water is then blown away to the north, whereas with a north wind much is returned to cool the system and delay the next eruption.\n\nMahanga Geyser, also called the Boxing Glove, is an old geyser not known to erupt until 1961. Its eruptions occur quite independently of its near neighbour Waikorohihi.\n\nWairoa Geyser, acclaimed as erupting high, last erupted naturally in December 1940 after which its water level fell to below overflow and the water became acidic. However, in early 1996, its water level rose to below overflow, with continuous powerful boiling, and it remains so to date.\n\nBeyond Geyser Flat is Waikite Geyser, which forms the apex of a prominent sinter mound 260 m south of Pohutu. This last erupted in March 1967, and since then the vent has remained dry and weakly steaming. In June 1996, its previously deep and dry vent suddenly filled with boiling water which rose to within of overflow. In the past Waikite tended to erupt after prolonged periods of excessive rain, suggesting that the level of water in its vent is dependent on rainfall. It is hoped that Waikite may one day erupt again. Meanwhile, Pareia Geyser, just beyond Waikite, has recently reactivated.\nPapakura Geyser is the other notable dormant geyser at Whakarewarewa, The cessation of eruptions from Papakura was directly responsible for initiating the Rotorua Monitoring Programme in 1981.\n\nWhakarewarewa School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .\n\n"}

The premise of the show is that \"Jimmy MacDonald's Canada\" was a wildly popular TV show in the 1960s, but that MacDonald had a breakdown while on the air and fled to northern Canada, taking all of the filmed episodes with him. His plane crashed and he was presumed dead, and the premise is these films have recently been found. The humour of the show is derived from the differences in social values between the 1960s and today. This humour also extends to now-taboo, then-common cigarette advertisements being included in the show, and even the opening credits, which lampoon the similar style of manic, partially animated credits that were common in the era.\n\nIncorporating scripted retrospective commentary from actual public figures (including then-current Prime Minister Paul Martin and the then-current Governor General), the series never breaks character. In his series, ultra-conservative MacDonald rails against various innovations and the rise of youth culture. Although fictional in nature, the series incorporates actual news and human interest footage from the CBC archives.\n\nCommentaries were provided by:\n\nMacDonald begins each episode by saying: \"I'm Jimmy MacDonald, and I'm going to give it to you straight!\"\n\nMacDonald provides commentary on trends in Canadian society from a reactionary viewpoint, opposing such \"fads\" as physical fitness, rock music and fashion, from the point of view of an ultra-conservative with Victorian sensibilities.\n\nMargison hosts a segment called \"A Woman's Advice\", providing advice on social issues based on personal experiences. \"Let's build a \"great\" Canada!\" she encourages viewers at the end of each segment. Running jokes related to this segment include Margison's expressions of veiled contempt towards her husband, and MacDonald's own attraction to her (at one point he is caught on camera asking for her phone number).\n\nAll but the first and final episodes have a section called \"Outrage of the Week\" where Jimmy presents three news clips related to the week's topic and then picks the one that outrages him the most.\n\nMacDonald regularly promotes the show's (fictional) sponsor, \"Provincial Brand\" cigarettes, a parody of commercial advertisements common on television in the 1960s.\n\nSeveral episodes include MacDonald conducting interviews with people in archival footage, most notably iconic broadcaster Foster Hewitt. A running joke with this segment is, since the original interviews were done with someone else, MacDonald is always having to correct his interviewees when they get his name wrong.\n\nMacDonald's \"collapse\" is given a slow buildup throughout the series as the ultra-conservative, traditionalist host becomes increasingly more frustrated with the modern innovations he's forced to cover (this is often played to comic effect, such as when he rails against the advent of the zamboni during one of his \"Outrage of the Week\" segments), but accelerates when he loses his temper on the penultimate episode dealing with the hippie movement—he is particularly frustrated with (vintage) news footage of a group of young people draping themselves over the statue of Queen Victoria in Queen's Park in Toronto. The final episode of the show, about the sexual revolution, is the one in which MacDonald suffers his breakdown on the air because of his outrage over how the show was turning out with what he believed was taboo material. He finally snaps after viewing a segment on elderly nudists and has to be physically restrained after he lunges at the cameraman while Marg looks on in horror.\n\nThe series never specifically identifies the year in which it is supposed to take place. This allows it to cover topics from the course of several years, ranging from the Twist craze of circa 1962, up to the Summer of Love of 1967, although the lack of references to Canada's Centennial that year suggest the series itself is not meant to be seen as taking place in 1967. On the other hand, a segment refers to Pierre Trudeau being the new justice minister, which happened in 1967.\n\nThe final episode of the series is set in 1966. After MacDonald storms off the set, on-screen titles indicate that \"MacDonald died 72 hours later,\" followed by \"Jimmy MacDonald, 1921-1966.\" The time frame of the other episodes is not given; the previous episodes of the series are not assumed to be set in consecutive weeks, though there is progression with relation to MacDonald's deteriorating state of mind, his relationship with Marg, and his physical reaction to smoking the sponsor's brand of cigarettes.\n\n"}
{"id": "2061529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061529", "title": "Arthur Keith", "text": "Arthur Keith\n\nSir Arthur Keith FRS (5 February 1866 – 7 January 1955) was a Scottish anatomist and anthropologist, and a proponent of scientific racism. He was a fellow and later the Hunterian Professor and conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He was a strong proponent of Piltdown Man, which was proved to be a forgery shortly before his death.\n\nA leading figure in the study of human fossils, he became President of the Royal Anthropological Institute. The latter role stimulated his interest in the subject of human evolution, leading to the publication of his book \"A New Theory of Human Evolution,\" in which he supported the idea of group selection.\n\nWhere others had postulated that physical separation could provide a barrier to interbreeding, allowing groups to evolve along different lines, Keith introduced the idea of cultural differences as providing a mental barrier, emphasising territorial behaviour, and the concept of the 'in-group' and 'out-group'. Man had evolved, he claimed, through his tendency to live in small competing communities, a tendency which was at root determined by racial differences in his 'genetic substrate'. Writing just after World War II he particularly emphasised the racial origins of anti-Semitism, and in 'A New Theory of Evolution' he devoted a chapter to the topics of anti-Semitism and Zionism in which he argued that Jews have survived by developing a particularly strong sense of community between Jews worldwide based around cultural practices rather than homeland, while applying the 'dual code' in such a way that perceived persecution strengthened their sense of superiority and cohesion.\n\nHe is also famous for discovering the sinoatrial node, the component of the heart which makes it beat, with his student Martin Flack in 1906.\n\nHe was born at Quarry Farm near Old Machar in Aberdeenshire\n, the son of John Keith, a farmer, and his wife, Jessie Macpherson. He was educated at Gordon's College in Aberdeen.\n\nHe obtained a Bachelor of Medicine at the University of Aberdeen in 1888. He travelled to Siam on a gold mining trip in 1889 where he gathered plants for Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London in his capacity as a plant collector assistant for the Botanical Survey of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nOn returning to Britain in 1892, Keith studied anatomy at University College London and at the University of Aberdeen. It was at Aberdeen where Keith won the first Struthers Prize in 1893 for his demonstration of ligaments in humans and other apes. In 1894, he was made a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. In 1908, as he says in 'A New Theory of Evolution', he was 'put in charge of the vast treasury of things housed in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons', which brought about a shift in his interest from anatomy to the pursuit of 'the machinery of human evolution'.\n\nHe studied primate skulls, and in 1897 he published \"An Introduction to the Study of Anthropoid Apes\". Other works include \"Human Embryology and Morphology\" (1902), \"Ancient Types of Man\" (1911), \"The Antiquity of Man\" (1915), \"Concerning Man's Origins\" (1927), and \"A New Theory of Human Evolution\" (1948).\n\nKeith was editor of the \"Journal of Anatomy\" between 1915 and 1936 and elected President of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland for 1918 to 1920. He gave the 1927 presidential address (\"Darwin's Theory of Man's Descent As It Stands To-day\") to the British Association meeting in Leeds.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1913. He was knighted in 1921, and he published \"New Discoveries\" in 1931. In 1932, he helped found a research institute in Downe, Kent, where he worked until his death.\n\nIn 1899 he married Cecilia Caroline Gray (d.1934). They had no children.\n\nHe died at his home in Downe, Kent on the 7th January 1955.\n\nBritish anthropologists Keith and Grafton Elliot Smith were both fixed on European origin of humankind and were in opposition to models of Asian and African origin.\n\nIn 1925 Raymond Dart announced the discovery of \"Australopithecus africanus\", which he claimed was evidence for an early human ancestor in Africa. The British anthropologists of the time, who firmly believed in the European hypothesis, did not accept finds outside of their own soil. Keith, for example, described “Darts child” as a juvenile ape and nothing to do with human ancestry.\n\nIn conjunction with his Eurocentric view on human evolution in Europe as being separate from Africa, Keith shared scientific racist views with a number of other intellectuals and writers during the 1920s, often based on Galtonism and the belief that opposition to cross-breeding in animals could be applied to miscegenation. In 1931, with John Walter Gregory, he delivered the annual Conway Hall lecture entitled \"Race as a Political Factor\". The lecture contained as its abstract: \"The three primary racial groups within the human species are the Caucasian, mongoloid and negroid. From analogy with cross-breeding in animals and plants, and from experience of human cross-breeding, it can be asserted that inter-marriage between members of the three groups produces inferior progeny. Hence racial segregation is to be recommended. However, the different races can still assist, and co-operate with, each other, in the interests of peace and harmony\".\n\nKeith was a strong proponent of the Piltdown Man. \"Piltdown: A Scientific Forgery\", written by the anthropologist Frank Spencer after completing the research of Ian Langham (an Australian historian of science who suspected Keith, and died in 1984), explored the link between Keith and Charles Dawson and suggested it was Keith who prepared the fake specimens for Dawson to plant. Phillip Tobias details the history of the investigation of the hoax, dismissing other theories, and listing inconsistencies in Keith's statements and actions. More recent evidence points to Martin Hinton, but the case remains open.\n\nwith Alfred William Hughes\n\n\"Concerning Man's Origins\", a book based on his Presidential Address at the British Association in 1927, contains a chapter entitled 'Capital as a Factor in Evolution' in which he proposes an interesting explanation for Britain's leading role in the development of industrial society. Essentially he argues that the cold unwelcoming climate of Britain selected those who came here for a special ability to store food and supplies for the winter – those who didn't died out. This 'capitalism' provided a secure way of life with time to think and experiment, for a population that had been selected for inventiveness and resourcefulness. Out of this special population sprang the Industrial Revolution, centred on the colder Northern counties of England like Lancashire and Yorkshire where the high-tech developments of the time took place in spinning and weaving. This is a rare book today, which does not appear to be available as a reprint.\n\nAn address given to Students at Aberdeen University. Keith’s concluding sentences in this book sums up his thesis : \"Even in the modern world we must listen to the voice of Nature. Under the control of reason, prejudice has to be given a place in the regulation of human affairs\". (p. 54) Keith remarks that the 18th century common sense realist philosopher Thomas Reid reached the same conclusion. Keith also cites Adam Smith, the theoretical father of capitalism, who in his 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments' (1759) regarded prejudices as part of human nature, to both preserve human life and for the welfare of the common good. Keith concludes that the idea that prejudices \"are not artificially acquired, but have been grafted deeply into our natures for particular purposes\" is not merely a discovery of Darwinism. Indeed, from a Christian perspective, these arational feelings must serve some higher survival purpose and are so largely present in life, that they all can't be dismissed as \"sin\".\n\nIn \"A New Theory of Human Evolution\", Keith puts forward his ideas on the co-evolution of Human beings, Races, and Cultures, covering topics such as Patriotism, Resentment and Revenge, Morality, Leadership, Nationalism, and Race. His particular theory emphasises the ideas of 'In-group versus Out-group', and the 'Amity-enmity complex'.\n\nOne chapter, entitled \"The Jews as a Nation and as a Race\", tackles what is often referred to as 'the Jewish Question', postulating that the Jews are a special case of a race that has evolved to live as the 'out-group' amongst other races, developing a special culture that enables it to survive by means of strong cultural traditions that bind the 'in-group' with unusual loyalty and defensiveness. Such claims are very controversial today.\n\nPhysical copies of the book are difficult to obtain as it would seem that original copies exist only in small numbers, and that modern reprints do not exist. However, an online reprint of the book is available (see link below).\n\nKeith wrote his memoir when he was 84, because \"a short time hence someone will have to write my obituary notice, so that what I set down now may then prove of service\". He recounts how he came to pursue his scientific work, and reports on important people whom he met along the way—William Boyd Dawkins, Conan Doyle, Charles Sherrington and others. Nonetheless, the lengthy volume was deemed \"completely unexciting. Events of sentimental interest and happenings of pure routine get almost equal emphasis.\"\n\nKeith went to live in a house very close to that which Darwin had occupied in Downe, Kent, in the latter years of his life, and took a great interest in trying to understand more about Charles Darwin. In this book, written just before he died, Keith gives a lot of detail about Darwin's family life, as well as his career.\n\nIn September 1931, Keith and other prominent individuals of the time were invited by \"The New York Times\" to make a prediction concerning the world in eighty years time in the future, in 2011, to celebrate the paper's eightieth anniversary since its establishment in 1851. Keith's prediction warned against overspecialization:\n\nThis supposed quote is used in an attempt to demonstrate that Sir Arthur Keith simply dismisses creationist viewpoints outright due to a presumed antitheistic bias. However, in attempting to research this statement, one finds that it usually appears without \"primary\" source documentation. In those instances where seemingly original documentation is provided, it is stated to be a foreword for a centennial edition or \"100th edition\" of \"Origin of Species\". However, several facts show that the attribution of these words to Arthur Keith is erroneous.\n\nKeith died in 1955, some four years before the 100th anniversary of Darwin's work, so that he was clearly not available to write an introduction for the centennial edition (this was actually done by William Robin Thompson who did in fact hold anti-Darwinian views as can be seen from his foreword published the year after Keith died). Furthermore, while Keith did write an introduction to earlier printings of \"Origin of Species\", in use from 1928 to 1958, the words given above do not appear in that introduction. Finally, the last \"edition\" of \"Origin of Species\" is the sixth edition published 1879. It is for this reason that all later publications of \"Origin of Species\" are actually reprints of this or earlier editions so that there is simply no \"100th edition\" of Darwin's work. The quote appears to stem from a 1947 article about—not by—Arthur Keith, in the magazine The Nineteenth Century, which was then misattributed.\n\n\nRedman, Samuel J.

{"id": "2061533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061533", "title": "Operation Outward", "text": "Operation Outward\n\nOperation Outward was a British World War II program to attack Germany by means of free-flying balloons. It made use of cheap, simple balloons filled with hydrogen. They carried either a trailing steel wire intended to damage high voltage power lines by producing a short circuit, or incendiary devices that were intended to start fires in fields, forests and heathland.\n\nA total of 99,142 Outward balloons were launched; about half carried incendiaries and half carried trailing wires.\n\nCompared to Japan's better-known fire balloons, Outward balloons were crude. They had to travel a much shorter distance so they flew at a lower altitude , compared with and had only a simple mechanism to regulate altitude by means of dropping ballast or venting lifting gas. This meant the balloons were simple to mass-produce and only cost 35 shillings each (approximately equivalent to £ in ).\n\nThe free flying balloon attacks were highly successful. Although difficult to assess exactly, they had an economic impact on Germany far in excess of the cost to the British government.\n\nBecause there was concern over what could happen if a barrage balloon accidentally got loose, in 1937 the British carried out a study on the damage that may be caused by a balloon-carried wire hitting power lines. These concerns were evidently borne out when early in the year 1940, the Air Vice Marshal of the Balloon Command, the organisation responsible for the barrage balloons, wrote that \"Since the outbreak of the war, I have had constant complaints from the electricity distributors regarding the damage done in this country by [barrage] balloons that have broken away from their moorings.\" to which he added \"...advantage might be taken of this to impede and inconvenience the enemy.\" Meanwhile, in 1940, it was proposed that bomb laden balloons could be launched from France. Their position would be tracked by radio triangulation and the bombs would be released by radio control when the balloon drifted over a worthwhile target. This plan was never put into action, objections included that \"attacks of this nature should not be originated from a cricketing country\" and a concern that the enemy might retaliate with similar weapons. The idea became redundant when defeat in the Battle of France put possible launch sites out of British control.\n\nOn the night of 17–18 September 1940, a gale broke loose a number of British barrage balloons and carried them across the North Sea. In Sweden and Denmark, they damaged power lines, disrupted railways and knocked down the antenna for the Swedish International radio station. Five balloons were reported to have reached Finland. A report on the damage and confusion reached the British War Cabinet on 23 September 1940. Winston Churchill then directed that the use of free-flying balloons as weapons against Germany should be investigated.\n\nThe Air Ministry initially produced a negative report, possibly because the Ministry of Aircraft Production felt balloons would be ineffective weapons and would consume too many resources.\n\nHowever, the Admiralty took up the idea with more enthusiasm. In particular, Captain Gerald C. Banister, Director of Boom Defence and a proponent of using balloons as a weapon of offence, pressed the point. The meteorological considerations including the possibility that the weather might favour the enemy retaliating in kind were carefully investigated and found to be highly favourable: winds above tend to blow from west to east, making it difficult for the Germans to retaliate with similar balloons.\n\nOf particular interest was the possibility of damaging Germany's electricity distribution network by shorting out high-voltage overhead power lines with thin wires dragged by balloons. Again, the results of investigations were favourable: trials showed that even a thin steel wire, much thinner than that used to tether the static barrage balloons, when drawn in sliding contact across two or more phases, could cause an arc as long as and that arc would be maintained until the circuit breaker opened. In some cases, the arc's heat could melt the aluminium outer layers and then the reinforcing steel centre strands of the conductors. Even if the cable was not severed, the conductors would be weakened so that they would be susceptible to breaking due to increased electrical demands or normal weather events such as wind, snow and ice. Investigations revealed that it was common practice in pre-war Germany to use a Petersen coil as protection against earthing; this design was effective against a short between a high voltage cable and earth but relatively vulnerable to a short between different phases. A short between phases could result in damage, not just to a cable, but to transformers and the circuit breakers themselves. The Admiralty ran trials using surplus spherical latex meteorological balloons about in diameter when inflated. Calculations based on the trials predicted that there would be between a 10% to 75% chance of a balloon's wire coming into contact with a high-voltage overhead line during a transit along the ground.\n\nBalloons could also carry incendiaries. Large areas of pine forest and heathland in Germany made the countryside vulnerable to random incendiary attack and it was hoped that the Germans would be forced to assign large numbers of people to the task of fire watching, possibly diverting them from more productive war-work.\n\nFurthermore, the Admiralty concluded that the balloons could be produced at very little cost; many of the important parts already existed as surplus materials, and despite the needs of conventional barrage balloons, there was plenty of hydrogen gas with which to fill the balloons. Finally, the balloons could be used with a small number of British personnel who would face minimal risks.\n\nThe balloons used were surplus weather balloons of which the Navy had a stock of 100,000 all carefully stored in French chalk. Using this surplus was important to the practicality of Operation Outward because white latex rubber from which they were made was an important war material that was in short supply. The balloons were about in diameter when inflated. They carried a simple timing and regulating mechanism that was based upon a design developed for Operation Albino – a plan to use somewhat larger latex balloons in an anti-aircraft role. At launch, a slow-burning fuse was lit; its length was calibrated to the estimated time to arrive over German-controlled territory. At first, the balloon rose rapidly and expanded in size until an internal cord tightened, preventing further increase in altitude beyond by releasing some gas; the balloon would then begin a slow descent due to the hydrogen gradually leaking away. After a while, the slow burning fuse would release a bung in a can of mineral oil; as the oil slowly dripped out, the balloon's payload would lighten, arresting its descent. The same slow-burning fuse was also used to release the balloon's weapon.\n\nThere were a number of payload designs designated: \"wire\", \"beer\", \"jelly\", \"socks\", \"lemon\" and \"jam\".\n\nAbout half of the Outward balloons carried the \"wire\" payload.\n\nIn the case of the \"wire\" payload, the slow burning fuse would burn through the cord that held the trailing wire. The trailing wire consisted of about of diameter hemp cord with a breaking strength of . The hemp cord was attached to of diameter (15 gauge) steel wire. Tests had revealed that the main reason for the trailing wire getting caught up in ground obstacles was \"springiness\" at the end of the wires; this was addressed by obtaining special straightened wire.\n\nAt the same time as the trailing wire was deployed, a stopper on the canister of mineral oil was released so that it would assist in maintaining altitude by slowly dripping out and lightening the load on the balloon. It was calculated that the balloon should have a slightly negative lift of about so that the balloon would descend until a short length of the wire had its weight taken by the ground. The long length of hemp cord allowed the balloon to maintain an altitude of about which would reduce the chance of the balloon being becalmed in still air.\n\nThe plan was that the wire tail would be dragged for about across the countryside and eventually encounter a high-voltage transmission line. A phase-to-phase short circuit would be initiated; during trials, arcs long were initiated by the wire. The arc would burn for some time before the transmission line protection operated; there was a good chance the circuit breaker itself would be damaged and the conductors might burn through due to arcing. This could cause a line to collapse and require repairs. German efforts to protect transmission lines from attack were unsuccessful: neither a new type of line conductor clamp nor different overcurrent protection settings had any useful effect.\n\n\"Beer\", \"jelly\" and \"socks\" were incendiary devices.\n\n\"Beer\" consisted of a cylindrical metal container in diameter and long containing seven or eight half-pint bottles. Each bottle was a SIP grenade - it contained white phosphorus, benzene, water and a strip of raw rubber, long, which dissolved and formed a layer. After a delay caused by a slow burning fuse, the metal container was tipped open and its contents allowed to fall out. Around the neck of each bottle was a small metal sleeve that held a heavy ball about in diameter. The ball was attached to a strip of canvas; this ensured that when the bottles dropped they fell the right way round. The SIP grenades would spontaneously ignite on shattering.\n\n\"Jelly\" were cans of incendiary jelly. Each cuboid can measured about and contained of jelly. A release mechanism and a fuse were provided; on ignition a fireball erupted with a radius of about .\n\n\"Socks\" were long thin canvas bags of incendiary material each weighing about . Socks were packed with wood wool, bound with wire and soaked in boiling paraffin wax. Each Outward balloon could carry three socks. The whole bundle measured about . When dropped, socks formed a Vshaped sausage designed to catch in the crown of a tree. Fuses were inserted in each end of the device and it would burn from each end for 15 minutes. In 1941 the Royal Navy had a stock of 10,000 such socks already fused and ready to be used and another 20,000 bodies that could be brought forward as required.\n\nAll the payloads that are clearly code named and described are either a trailing wire or an incendiary. \"Small yellow bombs\" left over and re-purposed from Operation Albino were also used and it seems likely that these are identified by one of these code words. It is possible that the other was used to drop leaflets - there are occasional, but nonspecific, mentions of leaflet drops in the records.\n\nAfter a lengthy bureaucratic struggle between the opponents in the Air Ministry and proponents in the Admiralty, the British Chiefs of Staff gave the goahead in September 1941 and a launch site was set up, based at HMS \"Beehive\", a Royal Navy shore establishment near Felixstowe in Suffolk. The actual balloon releases took place at the Felixstowe Ferry Golf Club. The first launches took place on 20 March 1942. Within days, the British were receiving reports of forest fires near Berlin and Tilsit in East Prussia.\n\nThe personnel that launched the balloons were 6 Royal Navy and Royal Marine Officers, 80 Royal Marines, 7 Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) Officers and 140 non-commissioned WRNS. The operation also required the assistance of the RAF Balloon Command (that supplied and delivered the hydrogen) and the Naval Meteorological Services. The balloons were inflated using hydrogen from pressure cylinders that were brought to the launch site by truck. They were inflated inside three-sided tents or windbreaks. During inflation, it was necessary to keep the latex wet with a water spray otherwise friction between the balloon and the tent canvas might have caused the hydrogen to ignite. The inflated balloons were conveyed by hand to a dispersal point, where their payload was attached. Balloon operations could be hazardous, and there were many incidences of launch crew requiring hospital treatment for burns caused by exploding balloons or by mishandling incendiary payloads. The WRNS were equipped with \"flash-proof jacket & hood (½ mica & ½ fine copper gauge over the face) + protective cream on hands and fire-proof black gloves.\"\n\nFor security reasons, the Felixstowe launch crews were referred to as a \"Boom-defence\" unit, a cover story that was partly true as they were put to work maintaining anti-submarine nets when weather conditions were not right for balloon launches. The Felixstowe golf club site had a number of Lewis Guns for anti-aircraft defence, which the WRNS women were trained to operate, occasionally releasing balloons for the purpose of target practice.\n\nThe British were keen to assess the effectiveness of Operation Outward. Intercepts of Luftwaffe communications soon showed German fighters were trying to shoot down balloons. This encouraged the British as it was felt that the harassment value on German air defences alone justified Operation Outward it cost the Germans more, in terms of fuel and wear and tear on aircraft, to destroy each balloon than it cost the British to make them. Later, reports trickled in revealing damage to electricity supplies and fires in forests and on farms. Most of these reports were harvested from newspaper reports in Denmark, France and other occupied countries where the German authorities tried to paint the British attacks in an unfavourable light.\n\nAfter the war, German records revealed that the trailing wire attacks had caused the Germans considerable inconvenience with electricity supplies regularly being interrupted and significant damage to the electrical distribution network. A 1946 report concluded that, based on available records, £1,500,000 of damage was done (approximately equivalent to £ million in ). The report also stated that the actual amount of damage must have been far higher because the records were very incomplete with no available records for the Russian zone and all records becoming less reliable after 1943. The Germans had attempted to record interrupts to the lower voltage lines, but the incidents were so frequent that the recording was abandoned. In addition to sending up fighters, the Germans used anti-aircraft fire against the balloons, sometimes shut down electric cables when an attack was anticipated, and modified the circuit breakers on high voltage networks.\n\nIn July 1942, a second launch site was set up at Oldstairs Bay near Dover. On 12 July 1942, a wire-carrying balloon struck a 110 kV power line near Leipzig. A failure in the circuit breaker at the Böhlen power station caused a fire that destroyed the station; this was Outward's greatest success.\n\nThe effects of the incendiary attacks were very difficult to assess it could be difficult to tell whether any particular fire was caused by \"Outward\" or by an accident, sabotage, or aircraft-dropped incendiary. However, intelligence sources included reports from newspapers printed in occupied Europe indicated that some fires had definitely been caused by Outward.\n\nOutward caused damage in neutral countries on the night of 19–20 January 1944, two trains collided at Laholm in Sweden after an Outward balloon knocked out electrical lighting on the railway.\n\nChanging winds could also blow balloons back to the United Kingdom. On one occasion, a balloon knocked out the electricity supply to the town of Ipswich.\n\nIn August 1942 launches reached 1000 per day, and later increased to attacks involving up to 1800 balloons all launched over a period of three to four hours. Balloon launches continued, though they were frequently suspended when there were large air-raids on Germany as it was feared the balloons might damage Allied bombers.\n\nFrom May 1944 it was decided to change tactics because of increased Allied aircraft activity. The mass balloon launches were stopped and replaced with a \"trickle\" of balloons launched from three sites at ten-minute intervals throughout daylight hours. Furthermore, only 2% of the balloons were to be of the trailing wire type. The \"trickle system\" was not thought to be a significant threat to Allied aircraft so it could go on uninterrupted. The trickle system simplified the hydrogen supply requirements of the launch sites, and released transport vehicles and compressed gas cylinders needed for Operation Diver and for the Normandy landings.\n\nThe last balloons were launched on 4 September 1944.\n\n\n\n\n"}

These events occur around the world, some taking the name Pillow Fight Club, a reference to \"Fight Club\" by Chuck Palahniuk in which anyone could join and fight as long as they fought by the rules. Both the London and Vancouver Pillow Fight Club's rules reflect that described in the book and feature film.\n\nThe trend owes much to uses of modern communications technologies, including decentralised personal networking, known as smartmobbing. Word of the events spreads primarily via digital means, usually on the internet via email, chat rooms and text messaging which result in seemingly spontaneous mass gatherings. Pillows are sometimes hidden and at the exact pre-arranged time or the sound of a whistle, the pillow fighters pull out their pillows and commence pillow fighting. The pillow fights can last from a few minutes to several hours.\n\nThe largest pillow fight flash mob was the Worldwide Pillow Fight Day (or International Pillow Fight Day) that took place on March 22, 2008. Over 25 cities around the globe participated in the first \"international flash mob\", which was the world's largest flash mob to date. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", more than 5,000 participated in New York City, overtaking London's 2006 Silent Disco gathering as the largest recorded flash mob. Word spread via social networking sites, including Facebook, Myspace, private blogs, public forums, personal websites, as well as by word of mouth, text messaging, and email. Participating cities included Atlanta, Beirut, Boston, Budapest, Chicago, Copenhagen, Dublin, Houston, Huntsville, London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, New York City, Paris, Pécs, San Francisco, Shanghai, Stockholm, Sydney, Székesfehérvár, Szombathely, Vancouver, Washington, D.C., and Zurich.\nWhile ordinary pillow fights have existed for a long time, these events are massive in scale, occur in public and are promoted primarily via the internet. Many massive pillow fights have been organized in an effort to break Guinness World Records, but the current record is a pillow fight among 3,706 by the BBC at a Children in Need event in Minehead, Somerset, England in 2008.\n"}

Auer and starring Gig Young, Mala Powers, William Talman, Edward Arnold, Chill Wills, Marie Windsor, and Paula Raymond, with cinematography by John L. Russell.\n\nJohnny Kelly (Gig Young) is a Chicago cop whose father is also a police officer. He's grown tired of the job and his married life to Kathy (Paula Raymond). Haunted by echoes of his mother-in-law's scolding voice, he plans to leave his job and his wife to run away to California with exotic dancer Sally \"Angel Face\" Connors (Mala Powers).\n\nThat night, Johnny begins his night shift with his older partner, Joe, who is proud of being a policeman. Johnny stops in at Sally's club, to tell her that he is not ready to leave for California. Sally is angry and breaks it off. Also in love with Sally is club entertainer Gregg, who mimics a \"mechanical man\" in the window of the club to draw people in.\n\nPenrod Biddel (Edward Arnold), a corrupt, powerful attorney, wants to recruit Johnny to arrest and \"escort\" a low-life former magician and current Biddel protége, Hayes Stewart (William Talman), across the border to Indiana, where there is a warrant for his arrest. Biddel, knowing Stewart's plans to break into his safe to find documents with which to blackmail him, wishes to teach Stewart a lesson about loyalty, after which he plans to get him out of prison. Johnny doesn't want to do the job while still officially a cop, but Biddel compels him by revealing that Stubby, Johnny's brother, has become Stewart's protége, and will be with him for the break-in.\n\nStewart, with an enthusiastic Stubby driving, goes to Biddel's office. However, on breaking into the safe, he finds only a note from Biddel, taunting him for his foolishness. Stewart later confronts Biddel, telling him that he has gotten the documents anyway, out of his bedroom safe, revealing that Biddel's younger, beautiful wife Lydia is his accomplice. Stewart also finds out Biddel's plans for him regarding Johnny, and realizes this is a good way to get out of town – escorted by a cop. He shoots Biddel in front of Lydia, and then kills Lydia as well. This second act is, however, witnessed by the mechanical man, Gregg, in his window, and Stewart later realizes that he doesn't know if he is a real man or not.\n\nJohnny's wife, Kathy, goes to her father-in-law, worried about Johnny. She might quit her job to try to make Johnny happier at home, as she is making more money than Johnny and thinks it must hurt his pride. Johnny's father agrees.\n\nIn the meantime, a call for Stewart's arrest has gone out over the police radio. Stewart goes to meet Johnny, but mistakenly finds John Kelly Sr., Johnny's father, a 27-year veteran of the force, who tries to arrest him. Stewart kills Johnny's father in his escape.\n\nWhen Gregg realizes all that has happened, he offers to go back into his window to draw Stewart out. Sally sees his bravery and integrity in this act, and she tells him from the side curtain that she understands him now, and confesses her love. Gregg sheds tears at this.\n\nStewart is outside, trying to determine if Gregg is real or not, when a woman watching Gregg in the club window notices tears rolling down his face at Sally's confession of love, and says so. Stewart hears and opens fire. Gregg is wounded but not killed. Johnny pursues Stewart through the dark streets of Chicago. Stewart runs onto the \"El\" (elevated) tracks. They begin fighting, and struggle until Stewart falls onto the highly electrified third rail, and then falls from the El and is killed.\n\nJohnny decides to stay on the job, with Kathy by his side. Johnny also discovers that Joe has not come in that night.\n\nFilm critic Craig Butler wrote, \"\"City That Never Sleeps\" is an uneven crime drama, one that contains enough good elements that it's frustrating the film as a whole is not better. The chief culprit is, as so often, the screenplay, which starts out promisingly. Gig Young's character seems to be one that is fairly complex, a cop who is dissatisfied with his lot in life and could fall prey to temptation. Unfortunately, the character is not developed sufficiently beyond that, which is also the case with the Wally Cassell \"mechanical man\" character; he, too, shows promise that goes unfulfilled, although the sheer strangeness of his job does fascinate.\n\nThe staff at \"Variety\" magazine gave the film a mixed review, and wrote, \"Production and direction loses itself occasionally in stretching for mood and nuances, whereas a straightline cops-and-robbers action flavor would have been more appropriate. Same flaw is found in the Steve Fisher screen original...John L. Russell's photography makes okay use of Chicago streets and buildings for the low-key, night-life effect required to back the melodrama.\n\nIn his Aug. 8, 1953 review in \"The New York Times\", critic Howard Thompson called it a \"routine crime melodrama,\" but singled out Wally Cassell's brief role as \"truly fantastic\" and William Talman as the cast's standout, \"a truly fine performer.\"\n\nOn February 3, 2018, director Martin Scorsese introduced a newly restored print of \"City That Never Sleeps\" as the opening film of a 30 movie retrospective of restored Republic Pictures that Scorsese curated to be exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, citing the picture's blazing energy and brilliant creativity.\n\nIn February 2019 the film played at the Egyptian in Seattle, introduced by Eddie \"Czar of Noir\" Mueller.\n\n\n"}

The mill was converted to an iron foundry by 1856, thus becoming the original Wellington Foundry. By 1899 the works had moved to the Wellington foundry in New Boultham and the original works were then occupied by William Rainforth. During the First World War Fosters built some of the first tanks for the British Army.\n\nThe company was known for producing threshing machines, regarded as among the best available. \nThey also made traction engines, steam tractors such as the \"Foster Wellington\" and Showman's road locomotives.\n\nFoster were briefly involved in a deal to market tractors built by Daimler in Britain but this was dropped after the war.

{"id": "2061564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061564", "title": "Divine Divinity", "text": "Divine Divinity\n\nDivine Divinity is an action role-playing game developed by Larian Studios and published by cdv Software Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, which was released in September 2002. It has three sequels, \"Beyond Divinity\", \"Divinity II\", and \"\". It also has a prequel, \"\", and a spin-off, \"\".\n\n\"Divine Divinity\" is an action role-playing game with a top-down camera angle and controlled primarily through the mouse. Its gameplay is focused on hack and slash combat and has significant similarities to \"Diablo\", with features such as random equipment generation and a wide set of skills organized into archetypes.\n\nUnlike Diablo, \"Divine Divinity\" also features a significant amount of traditional computer role-playing game elements such as branching conversation trees, non-combat skills like lockpicking, pickpocketing, and bartering, and a reputation and disposition system to track how NPCs will react to the player.\n\nThe game also incorporates point-and-click elements which allows the player to move and manipulate certain items in the world. For example, a barrel can be clicked and dragged to move it, revealing that a key is underneath it, or a hay bale can be clicked to spread it out and provide a bed for the player to rest.\n\nThe skill system, which would become a staple in later Divinity games, allows a character of any starting class to learn any skill. The system of attributes is also open-ended, allowing the player to develop their character in any direction regardless of their initial class.\n\nTwo thousand years before the game begins, those who sat on Council of Seven in the land of Rivellon sacrificed themselves in the fight against a group of treacherous magicians, who had passed over to the dark side of magic. To remember the Council of Seven, the \"Divine Order\" was founded to pass on the knowledge of the wise men to the next generations.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player wakes up in a house in Aleroth, a town of healers. It is revealed that Mardaneus, leader of the town, has gone crazy, and the player is asked to help by traveling into the catacombs beneath the town to stop the undead mage Thelyron, who is driving Mardaneus mad. Once Thelyron is put to rest, Mardaneus appears to bring the player back to the surface.\n\nWith the crisis in Aleroth resolved, the player leaves to explore, and is ambushed by a dragon rider, but is saved by the appearance of the wizard Zandalor, who explains that the player is one of three Marked Ones, and asks the player to meet him at an inn. Shortly thereafter, the other two Marked Ones are discovered dead, leaving only the player. The player is invited to come to Castle Stormfist, home of Duke Janus, a young noble who claims to be the Divine, a messiah prophesied to protect Rivellon against the summoning of the demon Chaos. The player is forced to do menial tasks for Janus, and no matter what they do, they end up in a dungeon, and have to fight their way out.\n\nOnce free, Zandalor takes the player to where the Council of Seven met, and explains that in order to find the real Divine, the heirs to the Council of Seven have to be brought together. In doing so, the player learns more about the way events have been manipulated by the Black Ring, the evil organization dedicated to bringing the demon Chaos back to Rivellon; the orcs have been goaded into attacking humans, and the elves and dwarves are poised at the brink of war, until the player reveals the manipulation going on.\n\nAs the new council members assemble to complete the ritual that will turn the player into the Divine, Duke Janus appears, revealing himself to be the Demon of Lies, in league with the Black Ring and seeking to summon Chaos. The council is attacked and a number of the members slain, along with the player. The player returns to life, however, with new abilities as the Divine, and is able to reach the fortress where the Black Ring is summoning Chaos. The Divine defeats Janus, but finds a baby who was picked to be the vessel of Chaos, lying on the summoning altar, and carries the baby out in their arms.\n\nAn early version of the isometric game engine was used by Larian Studios for its very first project, \"Unless: The Treachery of Death\", in 1996. Larian Studios was about to sign a publishing deal with Atari, but it didn't come to be as Atari announced its departure from the PC platform. Soon after Attic Entertainment Software joined Larian and \"Unless\" was turned into \"The Lady, the Mage and the Knight\", a game set in the universe of \"The Dark Eye\". Due to financial problems between the two development studios and its publisher, Infogrames, \"The Lady, the Mage and the Knight\" was canceled in July 1999.\n\n\"Divine Divinity\" development started in early 1999 codenamed \"Project C\" and later \"Divinity: The Sword of Lies\". The publisher forced Larian to change the name to \"Divine Divinity\" from \"Divinity: The Sword of Lies\".\n\nThe game was re-released in 2004 along with \"Beyond Divinity\" as a part of \"Beyond Divinity: Deluxe Edition\". In 2009 a remastered version of Divine Divinity was released as a download on GOG.com, the main change being support for higher resolutions.\n\nIn 2012 it was noticed that the source code of the \"remastered\" version 1.4 was lost because of a backup failure. Later released Digital Distribution versions are therefore based an earlier version of the source code, containing some fixes from the 1.32 hotfix (such as Finnigan's magic lockpicks), but not all bugfixes in the last retail version 1.34a.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot opined that there is \"much more to \"Divine Divinity\" than its impressive graphics and music and its combination of hack-and-slash action and pure role-playing, and that says a lot for the game.\"\n\nIGN declared, in summary, that \"\"Divine Divinity\" is a very easy game to get into and enjoy. It lacks anything memorable, like the party NPCs with minds and dialog of their own in \"\", but it has atmosphere, tons of quests, and a great deal of variety to offer. Above all, it's plain fun to play, to develop your character and find ever-better weapons and armor, to face the foe around the next corner. And who knows...? With BioWare's assets tied up in light sabers and Black Isle Studios working on a game that has no strategic pause mode, perhaps Larian will step forward to carry the CRPG banner in the near future. We could do a lot worse.\"\n\n\"Divine Divinity\" was a nominee for \"PC Gamer US\"s \"2002 Best Roleplaying Game\", GameSpy's \"PC RPG Game of the Year\", RPG Vault's \"RPG of the Year\" and GameSpot's \"Best Role-Playing Game on PC\" awards, but lost these prizes to \"Neverwinter Nights\" and \"\". It was also a runner-up in GameSpot's \"Best Music on PC\" and \"Best Game No One Played on PC\" categories. However, \"Divine Divinity\" won RPG Vault's awards for \"Surprise of the Year\" and \"Outstanding Achievement in Music\"; the publication's editors wrote that its score \"very proficiently supports the changing moods and locations in the game, never becoming either overwhelming or repetitive.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2061573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061573", "title": "Beat about the Bush", "text": "Beat about the Bush\n\nBeat About the Bush is the fourth studio album by English acoustic roots duo Show of Hands. Originally released by Twah! Records in 1994, it was their debut studio album to be released on CD, following the discontinued cassette albums that are \"Show of Hands\" from 1987, \"Tall Ships\" from 1990 and \"Out of the Count\" from 1991. It was their only studio album on Twah! Records, and was subsequently re-released in 1999 on the duo's own label, Hands on Music.\n\nFollowing Mike Trim's successful recording engineer work on \"Show of Hands Live\", the joint vision on \"Beat About the Bush\" was to produce an elusive \"radio friendly\" folk/roots album that retained the band's live sound whilst adding a rhythm section. However, despite positive critical reception, radio reaction was minimal, and the duo subsequently moved towards a stripped down folk sound, and would not return to bass and percussion until 2006's \"Witness\".\n\nThe track \"The Galway Farmer\" would later be a staple on every live performance by the duo (and Steve Knightley solo). It is one of the band's better known tracks, and would end up being on various other albums in different recordings (such as its appearance on the band's well known live album of their 1996 performance at the Royal Albert Hall, where it closed the main set.) The song \"Day Has Come\" would be completely re-arranged for future live performance. \"The Oak\" has continued to be played live amongst other songs on the album, including the traditional \"Blue Cockade\".\n\nShow of Hands, a duo of Devonian folk musicians Steve Knightley and Phil Beer, formed in 1987. The musicians had known each other for a long time. Their first recorded collaboration featured on Beer's first live album with Paul Downes, 1980's \"Live in Concept\". Show of Hands formed whilst Beer was a member of The Albion Band. The duo's first album, \"Show of Hands\", was released on cassette in 1987, followed by \"Tall Ships\" in 1990.\n\nLater on in 1990, Beer left The Albion Band, letting Show of Hands become a full musical partnership, recording another cassette album, \"Out for the Count\" in The Old Court in 1991. This was their last cassette album, and marked a hiatus for the duo as they formed the band Alianza with Dave Townshend with three Chilean musicians, exploring world music. For Alianza's only album, released in 1992 on the record label Road Goes on Forever, Knightley wrote tracks Show of Hands would later perform, such as \"Santiago\", as well as re-recording an older Show of Hands track, \"Tall Ships\". The band disbanded and the duo returned to performing as Show of Hands. Featuring a contribution from Beer's earlier collaborator Paul Downes, a live performance from the duo from 8 June 1992 at Bridport's Bull Hotel was released on The Road Goes on Forever in 1992 as \"Show of Hands Live\", produced by Mike Trim, and their first album released on CD. Trim's work for the album inspired the duo's next project; on TWAH! Records, the duo prepared for \"Beat About the Bush\", their first CD studio album. Their only studio work in 1993 was the \"Columbus\" EP, but the duo would return to the studio to record the new album with Trim in January 1994.\n\nMike Trim's successful recording engineer work on \"Show of Hands Live\" lead to his and the duo's joint vision on \"Beat About the Bush\" to produce an elusive \"radio friendly\" folk/roots album that retained the band's live sound whilst adding a rhythm section. The duo had not experimented with a rhythm section before. Knightley sings and plays acoustic guitar, whilst Beer plays fiddle, mandolin, viola, slide guitar and melodeon on the album and has been credited for being responsible \"for a lot of the unseen hard work involved in the development of the material's arrangements.\" The album also features various guest musicians; Knightley later commented that \"lots of friends were drafted for the sessions\". The album was recorded in January 1994 at Wytherston Studios, West Dorset.\n\nNine of the songs are compositions by Knightley, these songs are commentaries on life and lifestyles, some with \"the undercurrent of secondary story lines or oblique points, drawn out by a subtle shift of view.\" \"Living Tradition\" noted \"Cars\" pulls listeners \"into this song, berating traffic congestion and the sheer number of vehicles, and are then faced with the questions, \"Does anybody walk here? Or anywhere?\".\" The same publication noted \"Class of Seventy Three\", \"Shadows in the Dark\", \"Day Has Come\" and \"The Hook of Love\" with their \"strong lyrics and melody lines, work well with their given arrangements, variations on folk leaning towards low key, soft rock\", comparing the songs to Dolores Keane, Mary Black and Bonnie Raitt. \"The Galway Farmer\", one of the duo's better known songs, is about an Irishman betting on a horse at a race at Cheltenham Racecourse and winning, despite being ridiculed beforehand. Knightley, who was a part-time teacher, noticed the job's unusual impact on the song, commenting \"I taught part time for about four years but I think the impact on the songs was a bit of rigour when it came to facts and figures. I like to know my history and geography. Even when I wrote [\"The Galway Farmer\"]. I like to know the odds and I like to know the number of jumps.\" The song has been played live many times by the band. Many of the songs have been re-arranged for live performances, including most notably \"Day Has Come\", whose musical structure was re-arranged for their 1996 performance at the Royal Albert Hall and further performances of the song. The album also includes four traditional performances.\n\nThe album cover features a photograph of the duo holding up musical instruments covering their faces, photographed by George Wright. In 2007, Steve Knightley recalled of the cover shoot that \"after one boozy late night with Ralph McTell, [the duo] were in no state to face the cameras for the CD cover shot the next day. The suggestion to cover [the duo]'s faces with instruments came from George Wright, the photographer and save the world from a sorry spectacle.\" Visual Image are credited for the sleeve design, whilst Paulyn de Fresnes created the serif titling on the cover. The title of the album, \"Beat About the Bush\", is an English phrase meaning \"to prevaricate and avoid coming to the point.\" The phrase is old and first appeared in the mediaeval poem \"Generydes - A Romance in Seven-line Stanzas\", circa 1440.\n\n\"Beat about the Bush\" was released by Twah! Records on 19 February 1994. Peter Fairbairn of \"The Living Tradition\"'s review of the album concluded that \"the duo work well together and with this mix of their own material plus a fine set of tunes and a couple of traditional songs including a soulful version of \"Blue Cockade\", \"Beat About the Bush\" should appeal to a large and varied range of tastes.\"\n\nKnightley noted in 2007 that despite Trim's \"best efforts\" to achieve a radio-friendly sound, \"radio reaction was minimal\", and as such, another ten years were to pass before the duo \"dipped [their] toes once more into the world of bass and percussion\", the latter part referring to their 2006 album \"Witness\". During the supporting tour of \"Beat about the Bush\" that followed its release, the band met engineer-producer Gerard O'Farrell, whom they hired for their live performances, and he became Show of Hands' manager within the year, producing the duo's subsequent album \"Lie of the Land\" in July 1995. It was also following the release of \"Beat about the Bush\" that Knightley gave up his job of being a part-time teacher.\n\nThe band left TWAH! Records following the album's original release and signed with Isis Records for the band's follow-up album, \"Lie of the Land\", in 1995, which, partly thanks to producer Gerard O'Farrell, features a simpler folk sound than \"Beat about the Bush\". The duo then in 1996 established their own record label, Hands on Music, who have released all of the band's subsequent albums. Twah! Records re-released \"Beat about the Bush\" in Germany in 1997, whilst the duo's own label Hands on Music also re-released the album in the UK and worldwide in 1999, alongside \"Show of Hands Live\" and \"Lie of the Lands\", as both had been out of print following the disbandment of both Twah! Records and Isis Records.\n\nAs the band's prior three, cassette-only albums had been out of print prior to the release of \"Beat About the Bush\", a compilation of several songs from them was released in 1995 as \"Backlog 1987 –1991\". As those original albums still remain out of print, \"Beat About the Bush\" is sometimes seen as the duo's debut album. The song \"The Galway Farmer\" was featured on the 2000 compilation \"The Best of British Folk\".\n\nAll songs written by Steve Knightley, except where noted.\n\n\n\n"}

They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023.

{"id": "2061589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061589", "title": "Lupara", "text": "Lupara\n\nLupara () is an Italian word used to refer to a sawn-off shotgun of the break-open type. It is traditionally associated with La Cosa Nostra, the Italian organized crime group dominant in Sicily for their use of it in vendettas, defense —such as its use against Mussolini's army when he decided to break up the Sicilian mafioso network—and hunting.\n\nThe shortened barrel (or barrels) of a lupara lend themselves to easier handling in wooded areas, or to easier concealment and indoor employment in urban areas. The absence of choke and the shortened barrel contribute to a wider spread of shot than that of a choked full length gun.\n\nThe word \"lupara\" means literally \"for the wolf\", reflecting its traditional use in wolf hunting. The word achieved wider recognition through Mario Puzo's bestselling novel \"The Godfather\" in which the lupara is used extensively by the mafia in Sicily, including Michael Corleone's bodyguards. \n\nLupara can indicate also the type of ammunition fired by this gun, usually #3 or #4 buck. Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, in his novel The Leopard \"(Il Gattopardo)\", writes: \"[...] they found him dead [...] with twelve bullets in his back\", \"[...] lo hanno trovato morto [...] con dodici lupare nella schiena\" \"(Lupare is the plural of lupara, so the phrase means \"twelve buckshots of lupara\")\".\n\nFrom the word \"lupara\" comes the Italian expression \"lupara bianca\" (white lupara), a term especially used by journalists to refer to a mafia-style slaying in which the victim's body is deliberately hidden.\n\nAn early example of criminal use of the weapon in the United States was the assassination of the New Orleans chief of police, David Hennessy, in October 1890. After Chief Hennessy was shot in an ambush, four luparas were found at the murder scene. The murder punctuated a rivalry between gangs of Sicilian fruit company stevedores whose contracts did not fall under the auspices of the local longshoreman's union. A pile of sawn-off shotguns was displayed after the murder, including a homemade gun with a folding iron stock, and another with a hook on its stock to brace against the arm when firing one armed. Anti-Italian provocation, following the failed prosecution of a group of suspected men, resulted in a mob assault on the New Orleans Parish Prison and the subsequent lynching of many Italian prisoners.\n\nLuparas figure prominently in \"The Godfather\"; in the book, they are carried by Michael Corleone's bodyguards in Sicily, Calo and Fabrizio.\n\n"}

After 1990’s the sport has also been confused with \"Sit on top - surf kayaks, or SOTs which are more long canoe style surf craft.\nWaveski surfing has grown and developed into a dynamic ocean waves surf sport to surf surfboard like moves with specialized surfcraft combining the paddle power of paddling out to the back line,catching waves and power moves with deft manoeuvrability and performance of a surfboard.\nA Waveski resembles a larger volumes surfboard with flotation for the surf rider to sit on top of the board in crafted seat and feet Wells. The addition of a fins, feet straps and seat belt enable the rider to perform with the board as 1, the seat belt enables the [eskimo roll'if overturned. The waveski rider or waveski surfer uses a double ended [[kayak paddle]] for motion while seated in the waveski. To turn the rider uses his paddle to bring himself up the wave.\n\nThe origins are obscure, but waveskis have been around for over forty years. [[Danny Broadhurst]], a [[Long Island]], New York, surfer created some early waveskis in the 1970s, although these were heavy, bulky and not particularly manoeuvrable. The sport experienced its major growth in the 1980s with manufactures like [[Macski & Kola Ski]] being a dominant force in the market exporting worldwide to countries such as Australia, USA as well as into Europe. Original boards had wooden frames covered in glass fibre then became foam injected and soon custom hand made boards were being shaped and glassed out of polystyrene foam and epoxy resins. Contemporary boards are shaped in precision CNC machines and weigh around when completed. \nthroughout the 80's the sport Thrived, but as the 90's approached so did other developments in the Sport of surfing, and so Kola Ski closed its doors & the Waveski Sport faded away losing numbers & intensity,however with the comeback of the sport with New Manufacturers,combining passion and enthusiasm these new manufacturers of the 20th century have been growing the sport! \nthese manufacturers being:\n(RD Waveski's / Viking Waveski's / Bless Waveski's / KS Waveski's) it's thanks to these manufacturers that the sport is on the incline..\n\nMany of the manoeuvres waveskiers have been performing since the 1980s are only now becoming mainstream moves in surfing, where they were mocked in days gone by surfers, maneuvers such as aerials, flip aerials and various other radical moves one can do on a wave. The sport is experiencing a resurgence in countries such as Brazil and France tying in with the river and [[sea kayak]] sports and holding joint competitions as they share a common functionality. More junior riders and sponsors are needed to see larger coverage of this sport. Competitions are similar to stand up surfing ones and are judged on the performance of the rider on the waves within a 20-minute heat.\n\nThere are several kinds of waveskis, including the shorter and \"fatter\" Australian style ski, used for high performance \"slash and burn\" surfing, and American style waveskis perhaps epitomized by Steve Boehne's Infinity Surf Shop skis. There are also skegless skis for performing tricks, and even tandem skis. The \"Jbay\" wave ski shape has become the predominant shape of a ski nowadays with riders positioned further back on the ski for better maneuverability. High performance skis weigh and are custom made, using [[epoxy]] resin and EPS foam, which makes the waveski light and strong. The sport provides fun and exercise for beginners through to advanced riders. A waveski is not to be confused with a [[surf ski]]. Waveskis are designed for surfing ocean waves and surf skis are designed for racing in open water, as seen in [[Magnum P.I.]], the Tom Selleck TV series.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Human-powered vehicles]]\n[[Category:Kayaks]]"}

The position of Archbishop of York is the second most senior clerical position in the Church of England after that of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England.\n\nBorn near Kampala in Uganda, Sentamu studied law at Makerere University before gaining employment as an advocate of the Supreme Court of Uganda. Speaking out against the regime of President Idi Amin, he was briefly imprisoned before fleeing in 1974 to the United Kingdom, where he devoted himself to Anglicanism, beginning his study of theology at Selwyn College, Cambridge, in 1976 and eventually gaining a doctorate in 1984. He studied for ordination at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, and was ordained in 1979. In 1996 he was consecrated as the area Bishop of Stepney and in 2002 moved to the position of Bishop of Birmingham. In 2005 he was appointed to the position of Archbishop of York.\n\nSentamu expresses support for some traditionalist positions within the Church of England, as he has publicly criticised multiculturalism and the legalisation of same-sex marriage, but contrary to traditional Christian moral teaching he supports cohabitation before marriage, stating \"We are living at a time where some people ... want to test whether the milk is good before they buy the cow.\" He has also received attention for his vocal criticism of former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe.\n\nSentamu was born in 1949 in a village near Kampala, Uganda, the sixth of thirteen children. He obtained a Bachelor of Laws at Makerere University, Kampala, and practised as an advocate of the High Court of Uganda until 1974, being briefly a judge of the High Court. In 1973, he married his wife Margaret. Three weeks after his marriage, he incurred the wrath of the dictator Idi Amin and was detained for 90 days. In a speech in 2007, he described how during that time he had been \"kicked around like a football and beaten terribly\", saying \"the temptation to give up hope of release was always present\". He fled his home country to arrive as an immigrant in the United Kingdom in 1974.\n\nSentamu studied theology at Selwyn College, Cambridge (Bachelor of Arts {BA} 1976, Cambridge Master of Arts {MA Cantab} 1979, Doctor of Philosophy {PhD} 1984). He was baptized at Eden Baptist Church, Cambridge. He trained for the priesthood at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, being ordained a priest in 1979. His doctoral thesis is entitled \"Some aspects of soteriology, with particular reference to the thought of J. K. Mozley, from an African perspective\". He worked as assistant chaplain at Selwyn College, as chaplain at a remand centre and as curate and vicar in a series of parish appointments.\n\nSentamu was consecrated a bishop on 25 September 1996, by George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, at St Paul's Cathedral; to serve as Bishop of Stepney, a suffragan and area bishop in the Diocese of London. It was during this time that he served as advisor to the Stephen Lawrence Judicial Enquiry. In 2002 he chaired the Damilola Taylor review. That same year he was appointed Bishop of Birmingham where his ministry, according to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, was praised by \"Christians of all backgrounds\". Sentamu became President of Youth for Christ in 2004 and President of the YMCA in April 2005.\n\nOn 17 June 2005 the prime minister's office announced Sentamu's translation to York as the 97th archbishop. He was formally elected by the chapter of York Minster on 21 July, legally confirmed as archbishop at St Mary-le-Bow, London on 5 October, and enthroned at York Minster on 30 November 2005 (the feast of Saint Andrew), at a ceremony with African singing and dancing and contemporary music, with Sentamu himself playing African drums during the service. As Archbishop of York, Sentamu sits in the House of Lords and was admitted, as a matter of course, to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. He was the first black archbishop in the Church of England.\nFor a week in August 2006, Sentamu camped in York Minster, forgoing food in solidarity with those affected by the Middle East conflict, especially the children and other civilians killed and injured during the 2006 Lebanon War, when cluster bombs were used by Israeli forces.\n\nOn 7 March 2007, Sentamu was installed as the first Chancellor of York St John University. On 1 June 2007 he was appointed as the first Chancellor of the University of Cumbria. He took up the position when the university opened on 1 August 2007. In July 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by University of Chester. On 15 July 2010, Sentamu was presented with an honorary degree from the University of York by the Provost of Vanbrugh College, David Efird of the Department of Philosophy, and on 16 July 2010 was presented with an honorary degree from the University of Leeds by the chancellor of the university, Melvyn Bragg.\n\nOn 16 July 2007, Sentamu was presented with an honorary degree from the University of Hull by the chancellor of the university, Virginia Bottomley, at Hull City Hall during the graduation ceremony for graduands of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. On 19 July 2007 he was presented with an honorary degree (Doctor of Letters) from the University of Sheffield in recognition of his distinguished career as a scholar and theologian.\n\nIn October 2007 Sentamu was awarded the \"Yorkshireman of the Year\" title by the Black Sheep Brewery. In his acceptance speech he praised the welcome he had received from the people of Yorkshire and made reference to the \"African-Yorkshire DNA connection\", joking that perhaps his parents had this in mind when they gave him the name \"Mugabi\", which, spelled backwards, is \"Ibagum\" (\"ee-by-gum\", a stock phrase popularly supposed to be used to express shock or disbelief in northern England). In 2008 Archbishop Thurstan Church of England School in Hull was renamed Archbishop Sentamu Academy in his honour.\n\nIn October 2018, Sentamu announced his retirement, scheduled for 7 June 2020. In June 2019, he ordained his wife as a deacon.\n\nSentamu has spoken on issues including young people, the family, slavery, and injustice and conflict abroad. In an early TV appearance in 1988 he joined, among others, Ray Honeyford, Ann Dummett and Lurline Champagnie to discuss \"Race and the classroom\" on \"After Dark\". In November 2005 he sought re-discovery of English pride and cultural identity, stating that zeal for multiculturalism had sometimes \"seemed to imply, wrongly for me, 'let other cultures be allowed to express themselves but do not let the majority culture at all tell us its glories, its struggles, its joys, its pains'.\" \nIn 2006 he claimed that the BBC was frightened of criticising Islam.\n\nIn 2006, Sentamu featured prominently in the British press because of his comments on the treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.\n\nSentamu regrets that many low paid workers are not paid enough to lift them and their families out of poverty. \n\nSentamu believes that food poverty is causing malnutrition in the UK. In 2013, he said that \"last year more than 27,000 people were diagnosed as suffering from malnutrition in Leeds – not Lesotho, not Liberia, not Lusaka but Leeds?\" and feels these reports \"disgrace us all, leaving a dark stain on our consciences\". Government welfare reform were, \nIn the run up to the 2017 United Kingdom general election Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby and John Sentamu campaigned over the need to address poverty, education, housing and health. The archbishops stressed the importance of \"education for all, of urgent and serious solutions to our housing challenges, the importance of creating communities as well as In the run up to the 2017 United Kingdom general election, and a confident and flourishing health service that gives support to all - especially the vulnerable - not least at the beginning and end of life.\"\n\nIn 2000, Sentamu, then Bishop of Stepney, was stopped by a City of London Police officer near St Paul's Cathedral. Sentamu claimed it was the eighth time he had been questioned by police in eight years, and that he was the only Church of England bishop to have been stopped by police in this way. In a 2010 debate in the House of Lords, Sentamu was critical of the standards of \"reasonable grounds to suspect\" applied by police.\n\nOne of Sentamu's favourite references is to \"The Chocolate Trinity\" of God-fearing Quaker capitalists who were involved in developing the chocolate industry:\n\n\nOn 9 December 2007, during a live television interview with Andrew Marr on BBC One, Sentamu made a protest against Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. Sentamu took the white insert off his clerical shirt and cut it up stating that: His protest followed criticism against Mugabe at the EU-Africa summit in Lisbon.\n\nIn December 2008, Sentamu again spoke out against Mugabe, saying \"The time has come for Robert Mugabe to answer for his crimes against humanity, against his countrymen and women and for justice to be done\".\n\nOn 26 November 2017, Sentamu returned to \"The Andrew Marr Show\" and kept his promise to reinstate his dog collar following Robert Mugabe's resignation earlier in the week.\n\nMarr presented him with an envelope containing the original cut up pieces of collar. Of it he said \nHe then put on a new dog collar which he had brought with him. He also said it could be possible for Zimbabweans to forgive Mr Mugabe. \"Mugabe needs to say at some point to Zimbabweans: 'Forgive me'. He's a very, very intelligent man and I think he is capable of doing it.\"\n\nIn September 2008, Sentamu and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, spoke out against opportunistic stock market trading. Sentamu compared those who practised short selling of HBOS shares, driving the share prices down, to \"bank robbers\".\n\nSentamu, born in Uganda, said laws being debated in Uganda which would impose the death penalty on homosexuals and on those supporting them were \"victimising\". He told the BBC that the proposed law \"tends to confuse all of homosexual relationships with what you call aggravated stuff and that's the problem\" but that the Anglican Communion was committed to recognising that gay people were valued by God. Previously, as area Bishop of Stepney, he was one of four English bishops who refused to sign the Cambridge Accord: an attempt in 1999 to find agreement on affirming certain human rights of homosexuals, notwithstanding differences within the church on the morality of homosexual behaviour. In 2012 he stated his opposition to government plans to legalise same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom, asserting that \"Marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman, I don't think it is the role of the State to define what marriage is\" and \"We've seen dictators [redefine marriage] in different contexts and I don't want to redefine very clear social structures that have been in existence for a long time.\" At the same time, he expressed support for same-sex civil partnerships. \"They [civil partnerships] are in every respect in ethical terms an honourable contract of a committed relationship.\"\n\nIn 2016, speaking to Piers Morgan, Sentamu said that he would not call homosexuality a 'sin' and still supported civil unions while opposing same-sex marriage. “I support civil partnerships because I think that’s a matter of equality, and a matter of fairness, but for me, it was wrong for the Government to try to redefine the nature of marriage\" he said. In 2017, Sentamu spoke out in favour of a motion at General Synod to call for the government to ban the use of 'conversion' therapy, a controversial practice meant to change a person's sexual orientation. At the same session of General Synod, Sentamu supported a motion to offer \"welcome and affirmation\" for transgender persons as members of the Church of England.\n\nCommenting on Prince William and Kate Middleton's decision to live together before their wedding, Sentamu said that the couple's public commitment to live their lives together today would be more important than their past. He said that he had conducted wedding services for \"many cohabiting couples\" during his time as a vicar in south London, and said, \"We are living at a time where some people, as my daughter used to say, want to test whether the milk is good before they buy the cow.\"\n\nHe also said, \"For some people that's where their journeys are. But what is important, actually, is not to simply look at the past because they are going to be standing in the Abbey taking these wonderful vows: 'for better for worse; for richer for poorer; in sickness and in health; till death us do part.'\"\n\nIn a speech to the House of Lords on 19 November 2007, he opposed elements of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill for seeking to remove a child's \"need for a father\" in the IVF process. He said: \"We are now faced with a Bill which is seeking to formalise the situation where the need for the ultimate male role model – that of the father – is removed in entirety.\"\n\nIn 2017 he criticised the National Trust for \"airbrushing out\" religion from the National Trust Egg Hunt.\n\nSentamu has contributed to \"The Sun\" tabloid newspaper, and in 2012 he contributed to the first edition of the \"Sun on Sunday\". All the income that he derives from journalism goes to St Leonard's Hospice in York, of which he is president.\n\nIn September 2007, Sentamu wrote in his column that the parents of the missing Madeleine McCann, were subject to a \"whispering campaign\" and were entitled to the presumption of innocence.\n\nOn Easter Sunday 2008, Sentamu baptised 20 people by full immersion in a tank of water outside St Michael-le-Belfrey Church in York. Hundreds of people watched the ceremony.\n\nOn 6 June 2008, Sentamu completed a charity skydive from 12,500 feet with a member of the Red Devils parachute team. The dive took place over Langar Airfield in Nottinghamshire, with Sentamu aiming to raise £50,000 for the Afghanistan Trust. Yorkshire businessman Guy Brudenell had challenged Sentamu to do the jump at a charity dinner and Brudenell also took part in the jump on the day. In recognition of what was described as his \"pluck\", Sentamu was later given honorary membership of the Parachute Regimental Association.\n\nSentamu and Brudenell raised over £75,000.\n\nOn 15 April 2011 Sentamu addressed the crowd at Craven Park before the Engage Super League Rugby league match between Hull Kingston Rovers and Wigan Warriors. He asked the crowd to join him in prayer extolling the virtues of teamwork and harmony in sport. Afterwards he was presented with a Hull KR shirt.\n\nIn May 2016 Sentamu was one of six bishops accused of procedural misconduct by a survivor of child sex abuse (the accusation was to do with how the complaint was handled; none of the six was involved in the abuse). Sentamu was named in the \"Guardian\" and \"Church Times\" alongside Peter Burrows, Steven Croft, Martyn Snow, Glyn Webster and Roy Williamson, as subject of Clergy Disciplinary Measure complaints owing to their inaction on the survivor's disclosure. The bishops contested the complaints because they were made after the church's required one-year limit. Sentamu had acknowledged receipt of a letter from the survivor with an assurance of \"prayers through this testing time\". But according to the \"Guardian\" report, no action was taken against the alleged abuser nor support offered to the survivor by the church. A spokesperson for the archbishop said that Sentamu had simply acknowledged a copy of a letter addressed to another bishop. \"The original recipient of the letter had a duty to respond and not the archbishop\", the spokesperson said. All six bishops appeared on a protest brochure which the survivor handed out at Steven Croft's enthronement as Bishop of Oxford.\n\nIn April 2018 it was reported that Archbishop Sentamu and four other bishops were under investigation by South Yorkshire Police for failure to respond properly to a report of clerical child abuse. A memo from June 2013, seen by \"The Times\" and other media revealed that Sentamu had received the allegation but recommended that 'no action' be taken. The priest against whom the allegation was made went on to commit suicide the day before he was due in court in June 2017. The Archbishop of York's office said: \n\nA \"Guardian\" editorial contrasted Archbishop Sentamu's response to a statement from Archbishop Welby at IICSA, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, in which Justin Welby stated \n\nMatt Ineson, the victim and survivor at the heart of the case, has called for the resignations of Archbishop Sentamu and Bishop Steven Croft.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2061620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061620", "title": "Cherry Falls", "text": "Cherry Falls\n\nCherry Falls is a 2000 American slasher comedy film directed by Geoffrey Wright, and starring Brittany Murphy, Jay Mohr, and Michael Biehn. The plot focuses on a small Virginia town where a serial killer is targeting teenaged virgins. After being submitted to and rejected by the MPAA numerous times, the film was never picked up for theatrical distribution and was purchased by USA Films, who telecast it in the fall of 2000.\n\nIn the woods outside of Cherry Falls, Virginia, a teenage couple, Rod Harper (Jesse Bradford) and Stacy Twelfmann (Bre Blair) are getting romantic in a car when a black-haired female appears and murders them both. Meanwhile, in town, teenager Jody Marken (Brittany Murphy), the daughter of the local sheriff, is with her boyfriend, Kenny (Gabriel Mann), who thinks it is time to \"see other people.\" Jody goes back home to find her father, Brent (Michael Biehn), upset that she is out past her curfew. Brent and his deputies begin to investigate the murders the next day. They see that the killer carved the word \"virgin\" into both victims. At school, Brent sees English teacher Mr. Leonard Marliston (Jay Mohr), who urges him to divulge more details of the murder to students and the town so as to eliminate the possibility of secrets.\n\nAnnette Duwald, also a virgin, is home alone when she is killed in the same manner as the other two teenagers. Concerned for the town's safety, Brent holds a meeting at the high school to tell parents the nature of the crimes. No students are invited, but Jody and her friend Timmy, who stayed after school, witness the meeting. Timmy asks to borrow Jody's cell phone, and goes into the stairwell to make a call. Jody goes downstairs to find him, and discovers his dead body in a locker room. She is confronted by the killer who attacks her, but she manages to escape. At the police station, Jody describes the killer to an officer, who draws a composite. Brent confides with an old friend, Tom Sisler, (the current high school principal) that the suspect looks like \"Lora Lee Sherman.\" The two are both visibly nervous, and Jody listens in on their conversation.\n\nBack at school, Jody and Kenny reconcile. Later Jody learns from her mother about the tale of Lora Lee. Twenty-seven years ago, Lora Lee was a high school loner. She claimed that four popular boys at school, including Brent and the high school principal, raped her one night. Her cries fell on deaf ears and she left the city for the rural outskirts, where she was rarely seen or heard from again. After Jody discovers the truth, disappointed with the hypocrisy of her parents, she visits Kenny at his house. They talk and Jody, being upset with her parents, tries to have sex with Kenny. He refuses, causing her to get upset and leave.\n\nAfter catching news of the killer's targeting of virgins, the high school students in town congregate at an abandoned hunting lodge to indulge in a mass orgy. Brent goes to the school to meet Sisler only to find the principal dead in his office with the words \"virgin not\" carved into his forehead. Before Brent can react he is knocked out by the killer. Jody, who has refused to attend the orgy with Kenny, is out riding her bike when she cycles by Mr. Marliston's house and witnesses him dragging a heavy trunk inside. She helps him get it into the house, and he casually mentions that her father is inside it. She opens it and finds her father, beaten and bloody, before she is knocked unconscious. At the orgy, Kenny is about to have sex with a girl when he has second thoughts and leaves to find Jody. Driving around, he is puzzled to see her bicycle outside of Marliston's house.\n\nIn his basement, Marliston puts on a wig and makeup to \"become\" Lora Lee Sherman. Marliston reveals that he is Lora Lee Sherman's illegitimate son, and asks Brent to retell the story of what happened that night 25 years ago. Brent reveals that the four boys, including himself, did indeed rape Lora Lee. Marliston says his mother became an abusive \"psycho\" after the rape and that one of the rapists is his father; there is an implication that Brent is in fact Marliston's biological father. By targeting virgins, Marliston would rob all the wealthy parents of their \"precious virginal children\".\n\nKenny enters the house and frees Jody as Brent fights with Marliston, who manages to brutally kill him. Jody and Kenny flee to the orgy with Marliston in furious pursuit, killing a deputy en route. He bursts inside wielding an axe and mass panic erupts. After wildly stabbing panicking students and then trying to escape, Marliston fights both Jody and Kenny, with Kenny being severely wounded during the melee. Eventually, Marliston is pushed off a balcony by Jody and impaled on fence posts. At first he seems to be dead, before reviving briefly only to be promptly shot dead by Deputy Sheriff Mina, who unloads two pistols into him. The next day, Jody hides the reasons for the killings from the police and she and her mother head away from the station. As they leave town, Jody sees someone resembling Lora Lee Sherman disappear behind a moving school bus. The film ends with a shot of the waterfalls outside town, turning red.\n\nIn October 1998, \"Variety\" announced Geoffrey Wright as director. Wright promised an intelligent script full of irony. In 1999, the filmmakers began scouting locations in Virginia, using the town square in Warrenton; the high school used in the film was Thomas Jefferson High School, located in Richmond.\n\nThe film's set was described as \"tense\" by writer Ken Selden, due to the thirty-day production schedule falling behind, which led to budget issues from October Films. Director Geoffrey Wright kept Selden's original script relatively unchanged, but re-wrote the film's final \"orgy scene,\" which had originally been conceived by Selden as featuring the teenagers having a mass sex party under a giant white sheet. Wright opted to shoot the scene with the cast nude, which resulted in much of the scene being cut in order to avoid an X rating.\n\n\"Cherry Falls\" was shopped at the Cannes film market in 1999, and was sold for theatrical distribution in all international territories across the world. The film had a tentative theatrical release scheduled for November 2000. However, the film was troubled by censor disapproval in the United States, and the distributors' relationship with USA Films led the company to make the decision to release it as a television movie in the United States, syndicated on the USA Network. As a result, it became (and remains) the most expensive television film ever made, with a production budget of $14 million. \"Cherry Falls\" was released in the United States on October 20, 2000.\n\nThe film did, however, have successful theatrical runs in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe. It opened in the United Kingdom on August 25, 2000.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 53% of 15 surveyed critics gave it a positive review. Doug Brod of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated it A- and wrote that \"it might just be the wittiest, most subversive teen thriller since \"Heathers\".\" AllMovie gave it a favorable review, writing, \"Of all the teen slasher flicks that premiered after the wildly successful \"Scream\" series (\"Urban Legend\", etc.), \"Cherry Falls\" will possibly go down as one of the most creative, but sadly unseen ones in the bunch.\"\n\nDerek Elley of \"Variety\" called it \"a semi-successful spin on familiar material that could build minor cult status\". Nathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote, \"Smart at times but not nearly smart enough, and peppered with good ideas it doesn't really know how to exploit, \"Cherry Falls\" is just good enough to make you wish it were far, far better.\" Chris Parcellin of \"Film Threat\" rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \"It aspires to be another \"Heathers\" or \"Rivers Edge\", but doesn't make it.\" \"Total Film\" rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \"If you're not already sick to death of the teen horror genre, you might want to give this a look.\"\n\nMatt Serafini of \"Dread Central\" ranked \"Cherry Falls\" number seven in a list of the top ten high school horror films from 1996 to the present.\n\nWright won Best Director at Sitges Film Festival.\n\nThe film was released on VHS by USA Home Entertainment, as well as on DVD in a double feature disc paired with \"Terror Tract\" (2000). This disc remained out of print since the early 2000s. On October 10, 2015, Scream Factory announced that they would be releasing the film on Blu-ray in the spring of 2016. In their statement, it was revealed they had attempted to license the uncut version of the film but were unable to procure it through USA Films. The film's director Geoffrey Wright also stated he did not possess the original cut of the film, and was thus unable to provide it for the release, so they will be releasing the original cut as seen in the film's original telecast.\n\n"}

Later he obtained a master's degree and a doctorate from the same faculty.\n\nHe entered Croatian politics in 1990, during the first free democratic elections when he was candidate of non-partisan \"Osijek List\" () for Osijek local assembly. With the backing of Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), he became the first non-Communist mayor of Osijek after 1945.\n\nA year later, Osijek became a battleground in the conflict between Croatian government and local Serbs, backed by Yugoslav People's Army. During those events Kramarić had little power and city became under full control of local HDZ strongman Branimir Glavaš. But Kramarić, with his boyish looks, calm demeanour and a great sense of humour managed to use media spotlight in order to become one of the most charismatic and popular public figures in Croatia. Soon after the hostilities ended, Kramarić described his experience in a book of memoirs. Some of more colourful passages, especially those describing the role of local HDZ officials in the opening stages of conflict, brought him great enmity from government and even public threats against his life.\n\nBy that time, Kramarić had joined Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) and quickly became one of its high-ranking-members. In 1993, HSLS easily won the election for Osijek City Council and Kramarić was elected mayor. Under his rule, Osijek became one of few liberal strongholds of Croatia.\n\nIn 1997, after a split in HSLS, Kramarić followed Vladimir Gotovac and joined newly formed Liberal Party (LS). In most of Croatia, HSLS quickly got the upper hand over its former dissidents, but not in Osijek, where LS was much stronger than HSLS.\n\nIn the 2000 Croatian parliamentary election, Kramarić was elected to the Croatian Parliament on a joint electoral list of LS, HSS and HNS.\n\nIn the 2003 Croatian parliamentary election, Kramarić was reelected to Parliament, on a joint electoral list of LS, SDP and LIBRA.\n\nIn 2004 Kramarić opposed the merger of LS into Croatian People's Party. Because of that he orchestrated the removal of LS leader Ivo Banac, who was replaced by Kramarić's long-time associate Zlatko Benašić.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Glavaš embraced regionalism and left HDZ, taking few of Sabor representatives with him and making government majority of Ivo Sanader precariously thin. Kramarić immediately volunteered to help Sanader extinguish this threat and offered LS support in Parliament. This didn't reflect very well on local electorate, which abandoned LS on May 2005 local elections. In June 2005 Kramarić's attempts to create broad anti-Glavaš coalition failed when Glavaš sided with Croatian Party of Rights. Glavaš supporters took Osijek-Baranja County while Anto Đapić became mayor of Osijek, thus replacing one of the longest-serving elected officials in recent history of Croatia.\n\nIn 2005, Kramarić started merger negotiations with the Croatian Social Liberal Party, and the Liberal Party re-joined HSLS in early 2006. He became the leader of the HSLS parliamentary club. He was not reelected in the 2007 Croatian parliamentary election.\n\nIn December 2008, Kramarić became the first ambassador of Croatia to Kosovo. One of his columns published in a local newspaper in 2010 caused a minor incident with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 2011 to 2015 he was the Croatian ambassador to the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nKramarić is married and a father of one.\n"}

{"id": "2061641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061641", "title": "Ottavio Quattrocchi", "text": "Ottavio Quattrocchi\n\nOttavio Quattrocchi (1938 – 13 July 2013) was an Italian businessman who was being sought until early 2009 in India for criminal charges for acting as a conduit for bribes in the Bofors scandal. Quattrocchi's role in this scandal, and his proximity to Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi through his Italian wife Sonia Gandhi is thought to have contributed to the defeat of the Congress Party in the 1989 elections. In 1999, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) named Quattrocchi in a chargesheet as the conduit for the Bofors bribe. The case against him was strengthened in June 2003, when Interpol revealed two bank accounts, 5A5151516M and 5A5151516L, held by Quattrocchi and his wife Maria with the BSI AG bank, London, containing Euros 3 million and $1 million, a \"curiously large savings for a salaried executive\". In January 2006, these frozen bank accounts were unexpectedly released by India's law ministry, apparently without the consent of the CBI which had asked for them to be frozen.\n\nOn 6 February 2007, Quattrocchi was detained in Argentina on the basis of the Interpol warrant. The Indian investigating agency CBI came under attack for putting up a half-hearted effort towards\nhis extradition and India lost the case for his extradition in June 2007, the judge remarking that \"India did not even present proper legal documents\". Consequently, India was asked to pay Quattrocchi's legal expenses.\n\nQuattrocchi's financier son, Massimo Quattrocchi, grew up with Sonia Gandhi's children Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi. Massimo was reported to be advising the Luxembourg-based firm Clubinvest on business opportunities in India. He was also reported as visiting India frequently, and running an office in Bangalore. He was present in India at the time of his father's Argentina arrest in February 2007, and there is speculation that he may have met Priyanka Vadra around that time.\n\nQuattrocchi, born in Mascali, province of Catania, Sicily, in 1938, arrived in India in the mid 1960s as the representative of Italian oil and gas firm Eni and its engineering arm Snamprogetti. His family became close to the Gandhi family based on their connection with Rajiv Gandhi's Italian wife Sonia Gandhi, the former president of Indian National Congress party. The Special judge Prem Kumar observed in his order of 14 November 2002:\n\nTheir children grew up together, and based on this friendship,\nQuattrocchi had become so influential at the office of the Prime Minister \"that bureaucrats used to stand up when Quattrocchi visited them.\" Ashok Malik notes in \"The Pioneer\":\nThat his influence extended to ministers was noted by VP Singh, who initially pursued the Bofors scandal, and whose testimony is summarised in a court judgement:\nHe won about 60 projects for Snamprogetti, including: \nIn the process, it also became known that for contracts with India, Quattrocchi was the man to approach.\n\nWhen orders did not go through, as in the\nHazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur (HBJ) pipeline (1985), where Spie Capag of France had \"bid a few hundred crores lower.\" Vengeance was swift. Nawal Kishore Sharma lost his job as petroleum minister and was reduced to Congress general secretary. PK Kaul found his term as cabinet secretary ending prematurely and was sent to Washington, DC, as ambassador. The petroleum secretary, AS Gill, never made it to contention for cabinet secretary. The chairman of the Gas Authority of India, HS Cheema, was removed.\n\nIn 1984, a tender was floated for Howitzer guns for the Indian Army. On evaluation, the French Sofma gun was found to be the best in terms of price and features. The Army needed a range of 30 km; Army chief Krishnaswamy Sundarji favoured the Sofma because in field trials showed its range as 29.2 km against 21.5 for Bofors.\nFurthermore, as was revealed much later, Bofors was (illegally) permitted to alter its bid without re-tendering. Eventually, despite the objections of the army and others, the order went to Bofors.\n\nThe Bofors scandal erupted after a 1987 report on Swedish radio, claiming that Bofors had paid bribes to secure the\ncontract. A firm called AE Services was named – it was found to have a paid up capital of lira 100, and no employees\nChitra Subramaniam and N. Ram of \"The Hindu\" obtained the private diary of Bofors MD Martin Ardbo, which revealed comments such as \"Q's involvement may be a problem because of closeness to R.\".\nThe identity of \"Q\" became clearer when\nthe investigation team identified the Swiss bank where the AE Services' money went to, and determined that it was operated by Ottavio Quattrocchi. Evidently, R meant Rajiv Gandhi .\nThese were subsequently reinforced by the documents obtained by CBI from Switzerland, but these were eventually ruled out in court because they were photocopies, and not originals.\n\nOnce the scandal broke, the ruling Congress Party came under severe fire, eventually losing the elections in 1989.\nIn July 1993,\nthe Swiss courts had permitted naming the account operators, and\nQuattrocchi had been officially named. At this point,\nCBI attempted to question Quattrocchi, and permission was\nsought to impound his passport.\nHowever, just before Quattrocchi could be detained,\non the night of 29–30 July 1993, Quattrocchi left Delhi for Kuala Lumpur. It was alleged that he had been let off as part of a deal\nbetween Sonia Gandhi and the-then prime minister PV Narasimha Rao.\n\nIn March 1999, Quattrocchi gave an interview claiming\nthat never received any payment from Bofors, and that he did not have \"any connection with A.E. Services\". Around the same time, Sonia Gandhi spoke up for him\nin her first press conference\n\nOn 22 October 1999, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led NDA government in power, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a chargesheet against Quattrocchi, naming AE Services as a front company run by Quattrocchi and his wife Maria.\nBased on 500 documents released by Swiss banks after protracted legal delays, the CBI framed charges against Quattrocchi and his wife, Maria; Win Chadha and his wife, Kanta. Among the conspirators named in the case were Rajiv Gandhi, and some other party functionaries. Chitra Subramaniam showed that\nQuattrocchi, through A.E. Services, had been paid 3% of the sale, about US$7 million, as commission.\n\nAttempts to extradite Quattrocchi from Malaysia failed owing to lack of compelling evidence and in 2003 Quattrocchi returned to Italy. It has been reported\nthat Indian requests for extradition or serving the Interpol warrant were turned down by Italy, who have requested to see the evidence and prosecute Quattrocchi in Italian courts.\n\nOn 5 February 2004 the Delhi High Court quashed the charges of bribery against Rajiv Gandhi and others, citing inadequate evidence that any of the commission was actually paid to them. Sonia Gandhi celebrated:\n\nHowever, the case was not dead; two charges – cheating, and causing wrongful loss to the Government, continue in the courts.\n\nMeanwhile Win Chadha also died.\n\nOn 31 May 2005, the High Court of Delhi dismissed the Bofors case allegations against the British business brothers, Shrichand, Gopichand, and Prakash Hinduja, a main point was the technical issue\nthat the CBI had not certified the photocopies of the vital documents from\nthe Swedish authorities it had submitted to the court.\n\nIn June 2003, a London branch of the Swiss bank BSI AG was found by the Interpol to have two accounts held by Quattrocchi and his wife Maria, containing Euros 3 million and $US1 million. These accounts were then frozen upon the request of the CBI. Several appeals by Quattrocchi to de-freeze these accounts were turned down by British courts, based on vigorous marshalling of evidence by the CBI.\n\nHowever, on 22 December 2005, the Indian government position changed rather suddenly. The law minister Hansraj Bhardwaj deputed the additional solicitor general of India, B. Dutta, to London to specifically request release of these accounts. However, it appears that the law ministry never consulted the investigating agency, CBI in this matter.\n\nAccording to an e-mail from the British authorities (cited in \"India Today\"),\n\nOn 16 January 2006, a Public Interest Litigation was filed in the Supreme Court, and the CBI was ordered to ensure that the money was not withdrawn until the reasons for the government decision were clarified. The CBI asserted in court that Quattrocchi was still wanted in charges related to Bofors. It has been alleged by a writ petition in the Supreme Court that B.B. Dutta may have acted under orders from the law minister Hans Raj Bhardwaj and that the CBI was most likely not consulted.\n\nBy the time of the Supreme Court decision, the amount of more than US$4 million, had been withdrawn from these two accounts.\n\nThe issue caused parliamentary criticism of the government action, and also weakened the position of Sonia Gandhi, coming as it did within a year of the coalition led by her coming to power in the 2004 Elections. The main case against Quattrocchi continues to trickle through the Indian court system.\n\nOn 6 February 2007, Quattrocchi was detained in Argentina on the basis of the Interpol warrant. The events unfolded as follows:\n\n\nAt the time of the Argentine arrest, Massimo Quattrocchi was had purportedly been in India for seven months. He had arrived in New Delhi on 21 July 2006, on Lufthansa flight 760, and left by Lufthansa flight 761 on 22 February.\n\nThere was a sixteen-day delay between when the CBI was informed about Quattrocchi's arrest in Argentina (7 February) and when the information was made public (23 February, the day after Massimo's departure). This together with the failure by CBI to explain their reasons for the delay has led to speculations on a possible Massimo role.\n\nThe CBI director,\nVijai Shankar explained the delay saying that it took time to\ntranslate the documents from Spanish, but this explanation appeared lame, and it turned out to be false since the intimation was sent by the Indian Embassy in English. This delay, similar to the delay in informing the public about the de-freezing of the accounts, remained unanswered, leading to considerable speculation.\n\nOn 17 February, Massimo was allegedly seen at a party thrown where Priyanka Vadra was also present. Any meeting between Priyanka and Massimo was vigorously denied by Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh,\nbut when interviewer Karan Thapar asked him how he knew, he simply repeated the denial. Subsequently however, it was reported that the agencies were investigating his presence at the party, at the instance of Rahul Gandhi.\n\nThe presence of Massimo in this crucial period has led to charges by the opposition parties that Massimo, who grew up with Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi, may have influenced the highest levels of the Indian government resulting in the inept CBI legal process that lost the case in Argentina. However, the Congress spokesman blamed the loss in Argentina to earlier NDA government incompetence: \"we lost to three courts in Malaysia\".\n\nQuattocchi having been named as the main beneficiary in the payoff continues to hurt Sonia Gandhi. The position of the Law Minister Hansraj Bharadwaj has been compromised, and the\nintegrity of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has also been brought into question.\n\nIn April 2009, The Interpol removed the red-corner notice issued against Ottavio Quattrocchi after a request from the Central Bureau of Investigation.\n\nIn sharp contrast to a nearly two-decade-long investigation by the CBI, an income tax tribunal bench has ruled that Rs. 410 million was paid in bribes to Quattrocchi and Win Chadha, the Bofors agent in India.\n\nA major chapter in the 25-year-old Bofors saga was closed on 4 March 2011 with a Tis Hazari court discharging Quattrocchi from the payoffs case after allowing the CBI to withdraw prosecution against him.\n\nChief Metropolitan Magistrate Vinod Yadav, in his 73-page order, noted that the CBI, despite \"spending through the nose for about 21 years, has not been able to put forward legally sustainable evidence with regard to conspiracy in the matter. Further, in the case of Mr Quattrocchi, as against the alleged kickback of Rs. 640 million he received, the CBI had by 2005 already spent around Rs. 2.50 billion on the investigation, which is sheer wastage of public money.\"\n\nOttavio Quattrocchi died from a heart attack on 13 July 2013 in Milan, Italy.\n\n\n"}

He made his directorial debut with \"Father Figures,\" which began a wide theatrical release on December 22, 2017, by Warner Bros. Pictures. He was nominated for an Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography for the 2019 film \"Joker\", directed by Phillips.\n\nSher was born to a Jewish family and raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, where he attended and graduated in 1988 from Teaneck High School. His father, Paul, had been a doctor at New York University Medical Center, while his mother, Joan, was a teacher and taught at the Queens-based Lexington School for the Deaf. It was on a high school-sponsored trip to Paris that Sher first developed a love for photography, after his father convinced him to take a 35mm camera along with him on the trip. Sher has maintained his connections to Teaneck, staying in the basement of his aunt's home there during the filming of \"Garden State\", where he was able to use love of his home state to make location shots there make it appear as what \"The Record\" described as a \"verdant wonderland\". He expressed great pride for his hometown of Teaneck and its diversity, recalling how he \"spent a lot of time with an eclectic group of people. There's nothing homogenized about Teaneck even though you're in the middle of suburban New Jersey.\"\n\nHe attended Wesleyan University, where he had initially planned to pursue a career in medicine followed by his identical twin brother Andy, who later became a urologist. After taking a course on film history, Sher developed an immediate interest in cinema, recalling that \"All I wanted to do was spend every waking moment learning about movies and cinematography.\" He decided on majoring in economics and graduated from Wesleyan in 1992.\n\nAfter graduating from college, he moved to Los Angeles and immediately pursued a career in motion pictures. He started as a gaffer on a video shoot and an assistant on commercials before working his way up to cinematographer. Sher's first major release was the 2001 film \"Kissing Jessica Stein\". He achieved critical success with the 2004 movie \"Garden State\". Duane Byrge of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", in his review for the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, credited Sher's compositions with \"pack[ing] insight into the character's psychological states\". Sher also has worked on 2007's \"Dan in Real Life\" starring Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche and the 2009 release \"I Love You, Man\" with Paul Rudd. While Sher aspires to direct, he is in no rush given that \"I don't think I’ve fulfilled all of my goals as a cinematographer yet\".\n\nAs cinematographer of the 2009 film \"The Hangover\", Sher described how a scene early in the movie shows the main characters on the roof of their hotel overlooking a stereotypical shot of the Las Vegas Strip; Sher indicated that he had tried to evoke the behind-the-scenes Vegas—after the characters wake up the following morning—by shooting a scene behind the hotels where the real action takes place. Actor Bradley Cooper credited Sher's visual style with enhancing the film's comedy, noting how Sher has \"a great eye, a lot of energy and he just knows what's funny\" and that \"Some guys just can’t shoot comedies, but Larry knows exactly what he's doing.\"\n\nWith the success of Zach Braff's Kickstarter, Sher worked on Braff's 2014 feature, \"Wish I Was Here\".\n\nOn January 13, 2020, Lawrence was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his work on the movie, \"Joker\".\n\n, Sher lives in Los Angeles, California, together with his partner Hema Patel and his 13 year-old son, Max, and daughter Matilda. He was previously married to Jessica Aronoff from 1998 to 2017.\n"}

Late 1997 they brought out \"The Nine EP \" which was re-released a year later by record label Double T Music which would release their next album as well. This EP was produced by Jack Endino, famous for his work with Nirvana and Soundgarden (to name a few) and was recorded in just 9 days.\n\nIn 2000, Green Lizard released their first full-length album called \"Identity\", produced by Clif Norrell (famous for his work\nwith bands like Faith No More and Skunk Anansie). The videoclip for the first single from this album, \"Turn Around\", won the Golden Calf award for the animation, made by singer Remi. That same year they played the festival Pinkpop festival, when Moloko couldn’t make it. In 2001 they played the festival again and live recordings were made for a small live EP, which would be released as a separate disc (only at gigs) and as a bonus disc which accompanied the rerelease of \"Identity\". The second single is \"Autumn\". The videoclip mocks (boy)bands fabricated by recordlabels. Guesting in the clip are various members of Dutch bands and standup comedy.\nIn 2001 the band received the Silver Harp Award for \"Identity\". The song \"Down\" was re-recorded. The new version of the song, called \"Down 2K1\", featured Dutch rapper Brainpower and DJ TLM, and was released as the third single.\n\nIn 2002, their second album was released by Sony Records (Double T music was now a part of Sony), called Newborn. The album was presented to the audience at the Lowlands festival.\nAgain the record was produced by Clif Norrell. Henry Rollins guested on two tracks: on the track \"Common God\", which appeared on the album and on the track \"Die Fucker\", which appeared as the b-side to the first single of the album \"Wrong\".\nThe 4 versions of the second single \"Mouthful\" were made into a live album.\nIn 2004 their contract with Sony ended and the band went on to write songs for their third album in silence.\nVarious bandmembers went to play music in other projects, like Jaya The Cat and \"The Original Soundtrack\".\nIn 2005 \"Newborn\" was released in Europe, with a bonus disc including several clips, movies and songs from \"Identity\".\nIn January of that year the last show was played with guitarist Willy Tjon Ajong. During an emotional show band and audience said farewell to him. With him the song \"Ceilito Lindo\" was removed from the sets, as there is no-one that can play the intro to that song quite like him. The show was recorded by Fabchannel and can be viewed online (see external links).\n\nIn January 2006, Green Lizard released their third full-length album, called \"Las Armas Del Silencio\". The album was recorded\nin various places in the Netherlands and was mixed by Clif Norrell in Los Angeles. The album was released by I Scream Records (home of bands like Agnostic Front and Backfire!). The first single, \"One Minute\", was released before the album and is a split EP with the Belgian Punk band Janez Dedt. Both contribute two songs (the other Green Lizard song being \"All You Have\"). On May 5 the album was released in Europe and in 2007 the record was released in the United States. From July the band was represented by the TKO Agency, which represents bands like Motörhead, Ministry and Life of Agony. This means the band would do shows all around the world, the first of which was the festival Sziget festival. Green Lizard released a split single with The Gathering with their single \"Walk Over Water\" especially for this festival.\n\nIn March 2007, drummer Roeland Uijtdewilligen left the band. The physical strain of years of drumming took its toll. He'll continue to play in his folkband We Nun Henk. On April first he played his last show with Green Lizard, where Willy turned up to play a song with them. Jasper Dankaart, formerly of the metalband Agresion took over from Bram van den Berg (Krezip), who took over temporarily.\n\nThe band was on its way to write the next record when in November 2007 bassist Jay left the band. As a result, the band has suspended all current activities and it is unclear at this moment if the band will return.\n\nGreen Lizard is well known for their energetic live performances. The band has toured extensively, with bands like The Gathering, Krezip, Brainpower, Agresion, Soda P, The League Of XO Gentlemen, The Riplets, San Andreas and Cooper, and has performed with international acts like Alien Ant Farm, Dredg, Deftones, The Rasmus and Living Colour. They have also played various festivals like Pinkpop, Lowlands, Roskilde, and the Vans Warped Tour.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A government was formed by Abdullahi Issa Mohamud and Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal and other members of the trusteeship and protectorate administrations, with Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf as President of the Somali National Assembly and Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President of the Somali Republic. On 22 July 1960, Daar appointed Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister. On 20 July 1961 and through a popular referendum, the people of Somalia ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960. The administration lasted until 1969, when the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) seized power in a bloodless putsch and renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic.\n\nPopular demand compelled the leaders of Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland to proceed with plans for immediate unification. The British government acquiesced to the force of Somali nationalist public opinion and agreed to terminate its rule of British Somaliland in 1960 in time for the protectorate to merge with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) on the independence date already fixed by the UN commission. In April 1960, leaders of the two territories met in Mogadishu and agreed to form a unitary state. An elected president was to be head of state. Full executive powers would be held by a prime minister answerable to an elected National Assembly of 123 members representing the two territories. Accordingly, British Somaliland united as scheduled with the Trust Territory of Somaliland to establish the Somali Republic. On June 26, 1960, British Somaliland gained independence from Britain as the State of Somaliland. On July 1, 1960, the State of Somaliland unified with the Trust Territory of Somaliland, forming the Somali Republic. The legislature appointed the speaker of SOMALIA ACT OF UNION Hagi Bashir Ismail Yousuf as First President of the Somali National Assembly. The same day Aden Abdullah Osman Daar become President of the Somali Republic; Daar in turn at 22 July 1960 appointed Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as the first Prime Minister. Shermarke formed a coalition government dominated by the Somali Youth League (SYL) but supported by the two clan-based northern parties, the Somali National League (SNL) and the United Somali Party (USP). Osman's appointment as president was ratified a year later in a national referendum.\n\nDuring the nine-year period of parliamentary democracy that followed Somali independence, freedom of expression was widely regarded as being derived from the traditional right of every man to be heard. The national ideal professed by Somalis was one of political and legal equality in which historical Somali values and acquired Western practices appeared to coincide. Politics was viewed as a realm not limited to one profession, clan, or class, but open to all male members of society. As of the municipal elections in 1958, women in Italian Somaliland voted. Suffrage later spread to the former British Somaliland in May 1963, when the territorial assembly voted it in at a margin of 52 to 42. Politics was a national past-time, with the populace keeping abreast of political developments through radio. Political engagement often exceeded that in many Western democracies.\n\nAlthough unified as a single nation at independence, the south and the north were, from an institutional perspective, two separate countries. Italy and the United Kingdom had left the two with separate administrative, legal, and education systems in which affairs were conducted according to different procedures and in different languages. Police, taxes, and the exchange rates of their respective currencies also differed. Their educated elites had divergent interests, and economic contacts between the two regions were virtually nonexistent. In 1960 the United Nations created the Consultative Commission for Integration, an international board headed by UN official Paolo Contini, to guide the gradual merger of the new country's legal systems and institutions and to reconcile the differences between them. (In 1964 the Consultative Commission for Legislation succeeded this body. Composed of Somalis, it took up its predecessor's work under the chairmanship of Mariano.) But many southerners believed that, because of experience gained under the Italian trusteeship, theirs was the better prepared of the two regions for self-government. Northern political, administrative, and commercial elites were reluctant to recognize that they now had to deal with Mogadishu.\n\nAt independence, the northern region had two functioning political parties: the SNL, representing the Isaaq clan-family that constituted a numerical majority there; and the USP, supported largely by the Dir and the Daarood. In a unified Somalia, however, the Isaaq were a small minority, whereas the northern Daarood joined members of their clan-family from the south in the SYL. The Dir, having few kinsmen in the south, were pulled on the one hand by traditional ties to the Hawiye and on the other hand by common regional sympathies to the Isaaq. The southern opposition party, the Greater Somalia League (GSL), pro-Arab and militantly pan-Somalist, attracted the support of the SNL and the USP against the SYL, which had adopted a moderate stand before independence.\n\nNorthern misgivings about being too tightly harnessed to the south were demonstrated by the voting pattern in the June 1961 referendum on the constitution, which was in effect Somalia's first national election. Although the draft was overwhelmingly approved in the south, it was supported by less than 50 percent of the northern electorate.\n\nDissatisfaction at the distribution of power among the clan families and between the two regions boiled over in December 1961, when a group of British-trained junior army officers in the north rebelled in reaction to the posting of higher ranking southern officers (who had been trained by the Italians for police duties) to command their units. The ringleaders urged a separation of north and south. Northern non-commissioned officers arrested the rebels, but discontent in the north persisted.\n\nIn early 1962, GSL leader Haaji Mahammad Husseen, seeking in part to exploit northern dissatisfaction, attempted to form an amalgamated party, known as the Somali Democratic Union (SDU). It enrolled northern elements, some of which were displeased with the northern SNL representatives in the coalition government. Hussein's attempt failed. In May 1962, however, Egal and another northern SNL minister resigned from the cabinet and took many SNL followers with them into a new party, the Somali National Congress (SNC), which won widespread northern support. The new party also gained support in the south when it was joined by an SYL faction composed predominantly of Hawiye. This move gave the country three truly national political parties and further served to blur north-south differences.\n\nThe most important political issue in post-independence Somali politics was the unification of all areas traditionally inhabited by ethnic Somalis into one country – a concept identified as Greater Somalia (\"Soomaaliweyn\"). Politicians knew well that they had no chance of winning elections if they did not promote the unification of all Somali territories. This issue of Somali nationalism dominated popular opinion and that any government would fall if it did not demonstrate a desire to reappropriate occupied Somali territory.\n\nPreoccupation with Greater Somalia shaped the character of the country's newly formed institutions and led to the build-up of the Somali military in preparation for campaigns to retrieve Somali land. By law, the exact size of the National Assembly was not established in order to facilitate the inclusion of representatives of the contested areas after unification. The national flag also featured a five-pointed star, whose points represented areas traditionally inhabited by ethnic Somalis: the former Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland, the Ogaden, French Somaliland, and the Northern Frontier District. Moreover, the preamble to the constitution approved in 1961 included the statement, \"The Somali Republic promotes by legal and peaceful means, the union of the territories.\" The constitution also provided that all ethnic Somalis, no matter where they resided, were citizens of the republic. The Somalis did not claim sovereignty over adjacent territories, but rather demanded that Somalis living in them be granted the right to self-determination. Somali leaders asserted that they would be satisfied only when their fellow Somalis outside the republic had the opportunity to decide for themselves what their status would be.\n\nIn 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis, the British \"returned\" the Haud (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably 'protected' by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II in exchange for his help against raids by Somali clans. Britain included the proviso that the Somali inhabitants would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. The Somali government refused in particular to acknowledge the validity of the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1954 recognizing Ethiopia's claim to the Haud or, in general, the relevance of treaties defining Somali-Ethiopian borders. Somalia's position was based on three points: first, that the treaties disregarded agreements made with Somali actors that had put them under British protection; second, that the Somalis were not consulted on the terms of the treaties and in fact had not been informed of their existence; and third, that such treaties violated the self-determination principle. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands that it had turned over.\n\nHostilities grew steadily, eventually involving small-scale actions between the Somali National Army and Imperial Ethiopian Armed Forces along the border. In February 1964, armed conflict erupted on the Somali-Ethiopian frontier, and Ethiopian aircraft raided targets in Somalia. The confrontation ended in April through the mediation of Sudan, acting under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Under the terms of the cease-fire, a joint commission was formed to examine the causes of frontier incidents, and a demilitarized zone ten to fifteen kilometers wide was established on either side of the border. At least temporarily, further military confrontations were prevented.\n\nA referendum was held in neighboring Djibouti (then known as French Somaliland) in 1958, on the eve of Somalia's independence in 1960, to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls. The majority of those who had voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later under mysterious circumstances.\n\nAt the 1961 London talks on the future of the Kenya Colony, Somali representatives from the Northern Frontier District (NFD) demanded that Britain arrange for the region's separation before Kenya was granted independence. The British government appointed a commission to ascertain popular opinion in the NFD on the question. The informal plebiscite demonstrated the overwhelming desire of the region's population, which mainly consisted of Somalis and Oromos, to join the newly formed Somali Republic. A 1962 editorial in \"The Observer\", Britain's oldest Sunday newspaper, concurrently noted that \"by every criterion, the Kenya Somalis have a right to choose their own future[...] they differ from other Kenyans not just tribally but in almost every way[...] they are Hamitic, have different customs, a different religion (Islam), and they inhabit a desert which contributes little or nothing to the Kenya economy[...] nobody can accuse them of trying to make off with the national wealth\". Despite Somali diplomatic activity, the colonial government in Kenya did not act on the commission's findings. British officials believed that the federal format then proposed in the Kenyan constitution would provide a solution through the degree of autonomy it allowed the predominantly Somali region within the federal system. This solution did not diminish Somali demands for unification, however, and the modicum of federalism disappeared after Kenya's post-colonial government opted instead for a centralized constitution in 1964.\n\nLed by the Northern Province People's Progressive Party (NPPPP), Somalis in the NFD vigorously sought union with their kin in the Somali Republic to the north. In response, the new Kenyan government enacted a number of repressive measures designed to frustrate their efforts. Among these was the practice of mislabeling the Somali rebels' ethnically-based claims as \"shifta\" (\"bandit\") activity, cordoning off of the NFD as a \"scheduled\" area, confiscating or slaughtering Somali livestock, sponsoring ethnic cleansing campaigns against the region's inhabitants, and setting up large \"protected villages\" or concentration camps. These policies culminated in the Shifta War between Somali rebels and the Kenyan police and army. Voice of Somalia radio reportedly influenced the level of guerrilla activity by means of its broadcasts beamed into the NFD. Kenya also accused the Somali government of training the rebels in Somalia, equipping them with Soviet arms, and directing them from Mogadishu. It subsequently signed a mutual defense pact with Ethiopia in 1964, though the treaty had little effect as cross-border flow of materiel from Somalia to the guerrillas continued. In October 1967, the Somali government and Kenyan authorities signed a Memorandum of Understanding (the Arusha Memorandum) that resulted in an official ceasefire, though regional security did not prevail until 1969.\n\nCountrywide municipal elections, in which the Somali Youth League won 74 percent of the seats, occurred in November 1963. These were followed in March 1964 by the country's first post-independence national elections. Again the SYL triumphed, winning 69 out of 123 parliamentary seats. The party's true margin of victory was even greater, as the fifty-four seats won by the opposition were divided among a number of small parties.\n\nAfter the 1964 National Assembly election in March, a crisis occurred that left Somalia without a government until the beginning of September. President Osman, who was empowered to propose the candidate for prime minister after an election or the fall of a government, chose Abdirizak Haji Hussein as his nominee instead of the incumbent, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, who had the endorsement of the SYL party leadership. Shermarke had been prime minister for the four previous years, and Osman decided that new leadership might be able to introduce fresh ideas for solving national problems.\n\nIn drawing up a Council of Ministers for presentation to the National Assembly, the nominee for prime minister chose candidates on the basis of ability and without regard to place of origin. But Hussein's choices strained intraparty relations and broke the unwritten rules that there be clan and regional balance. For instance, only two members of Shermarke's cabinet were to be retained, and the number of posts in northern hands was to be increased from two to five.\n\nThe SYL's governing Central Committee and its parliamentary groups became split. Hussein had been a party member since 1944 and had participated in the two previous Shermarke cabinets. His primary appeal was to younger and more educated party members. Several political leaders who had been left out of the cabinet joined the supporters of Shermarke to form an opposition group within the party. As a result, the Hussein faction sought support among non-SYL members of the National Assembly.\n\nAlthough the disagreements primarily involved personal or group political ambitions, the debate leading to the initial vote of confidence centered on the issue of Greater Somalia. Both Osman and prime minister-designate Hussein wanted to give priority to the country's internal economic and social problems. Although Hussein had supported militant pan-Somalism, he was portrayed as willing to accept the continued sovereignty of Ethiopia and Kenya over Somali areas.\n\nThe proposed cabinet failed to be affirmed by a margin of two votes. Seven National Assembly members, including Shermarke, abstained, while forty-eight members of the SYL voted for Hussein and thirty-three opposed him. Despite the apparent split in the SYL, it continued to attract recruits from other parties. In the first three months after the election, seventeen members of the parliamentary opposition resigned from their parties to join the SYL.\n\nOsman ignored the results of the vote and again nominated Hussein as prime minister. After intraparty negotiation, which included the reinstatement of four party officials expelled for voting against him, Hussein presented a second cabinet list to the National Assembly that included all but one of his earlier nominees. However, the proposed new cabinet contained three additional ministerial positions filled by men chosen to mollify opposition factions. The new cabinet was approved with the support of all but a handful of SYL National Assembly members. Hussein remained in office until the presidential elections of June 1967.\n\nThe 1967 presidential elections, conducted by a secret poll of National Assembly members, pitted former prime minister Shermarke against Osman. Again the central issue was moderation versus militancy on the pan-Somali question. Osman, through Hussein, had stressed priority for internal development. Shermarke, who had served as prime minister when pan-Somalism was at its height, was elected president of the republic.\n\nThe new president nominated as prime minister Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal, who raised cabinet membership from thirteen to fifteen members and included representatives of every major clan family, as well as some members of the rival Somali National Congress. In August 1967, the National Assembly confirmed his appointment without serious opposition. Although the new prime minister had supported Shermarke in the presidential election, he was a northerner and had led a 1962 defection of the northern SNL assembly members from the government. He had also been closely involved in the founding of the SNC but, with many other northern members of that group, had rejoined the SYL after the 1964 elections.\n\nA more important difference between Shermarke and Egal, other than their past affiliations, was the new prime minister's moderate position on pan-Somali issues and his desire for improved relations with other African countries. In these areas, he was allied with the \"modernists\" in the government, parliament, and administration who favored redirecting the nation's energies from confrontation with its neighbors to combating social and economic ills. Although many of his domestic policies seemed more in line with those of the previous administration, Egal continued to hold the confidence of both Shermarke and the National Assembly during the eighteen months preceding the March 1969 national elections.\n\nThe March 1969 elections were the first to combine voting for municipal and National Assembly posts. Sixty-four parties contested the elections. Only the SYL, however, presented candidates in every election district, in many cases without opposition. Eight other parties presented lists of candidates for national offices in most districts. Of the remaining fifty-five parties, only twenty-four gained representation in the assembly, but all of these were disbanded almost immediately when their fifty members joined the SYL.\n\nBoth the plethora of parties and the defection to the majority party were typical of Somali parliamentary elections. To register for elective office, a candidate merely needed either the support of 500 voters or the sponsorship of his clan, expressed through a vote of its traditional assembly. After registering, the office seeker then attempted to become the official candidate of a political party. Failing this, he would remain on the ballot as an individual contestant. Voting was by party list, which could make a candidate a one-person party. (This practice explained not only the proliferation of small parties but also the transient nature of party support.) Many candidates affiliated with a major party only long enough to use its symbol in the election campaign and, if elected, abandoned it for the winning side as soon as the National Assembly met. Thus, by the end of May 1969 the SYL parliamentary cohort had swelled from 73 to 109.\n\nIn addition, the eleven SNC members had formed a coalition with the SYL, which held 120 of the 123 seats in the National Assembly. A few of these 120 left the SYL after the composition of Egal's cabinet became clear and after the announcement of his program, both of which were bound to displease some who had joined only to be on the winning side. Offered a huge list of candidates, the almost 900,000 voters in 1969 took delight in defeating incumbents. Of the incumbent deputies, 77 out of 123 were not returned (including 8 out of 18 members of the previous cabinet), but these figures did not unequivocally demonstrate dissatisfaction with the government. Statistically, they were nearly identical with the results of the 1964 election, and, given the profusion of parties and the system of proportional representation, a clear sense of public opinion could not be obtained solely on the basis of the election results. The fact that a single party—the SYL—dominated the field implied neither stability nor solidarity. Anthropologist Ioan M. Lewis has noted that the SYL government was a very heterogeneous group with diverging personal and lineage interests.\n\nCandidates who had lost seats in the assembly and those who had supported them were frustrated and angry. A number of charges were made of government election fraud, at least some firmly founded. Discontent was exacerbated when the Supreme Court, under its newly appointed president, declined to accept jurisdiction over election petitions, although it had accepted such jurisdiction on an earlier occasion.\n\nNeither the president nor the prime minister seemed particularly concerned about official corruption and nepotism. Although these practices were conceivably normal in a society based on kinship, some were bitter over their prevalence in the National Assembly, where it seemed that deputies ignored their constituents in trading votes for personal gain.\n\nAmong those most dissatisfied with the government were intellectuals and members of the armed forces and police. (General Mohamed Abshir Muse, the chief of police, had resigned just before the elections after refusing to permit police vehicles to transport SYL voters to the polls.) Of these dissatisfied groups, the most significant element was the military, which since 1961 had remained outside politics. It had done so partly because the government had not called upon it for support and partly because, unlike most other African armed forces, the Somali National Army had a genuine external mission in which it was supported by all Somalis – that of protecting the borders with Ethiopia and Kenya.\n\nOn October 15, 1969, while paying a visit to the northern town of Las Anod, Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d'état on October 21, 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition — essentially a bloodless takeover. The coup was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.\n\nAlongside Barre, the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination, was led by Mohamed Ainanshe Guleid Mohammad Ali Samatar, Abdullah Mohamed Fadil and Salaad Gabeyre Kediye Kediye a paid KGB agent code-named \"OPERATOR\". Also included in the coup leaders was Chief of Police Jama Korshel.\n\nBarre was the most senior and the leader the SRC. The SRC subsequently renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic, arrested members of the former government, banned political parties, dissolved the parliament and the Supreme Court, and suspended the constitution.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2061696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061696", "title": "Odense Boldklub", "text": "Odense Boldklub\n\nOdense Boldklub (; also known as Odense BK or the more commonly used OB) is a Danish professional football club based in the city Odense. The club has won three Danish championships and five Danish Cup trophies. OB play in the Danish Superliga and their home field is Nature Energy Park. OB's clubhouse is located in Ådalen near Odense River.\n\nOB were founded on 12 July 1887 as \"Odense Cricketklub\", with cricket the only sport. In 1889, football and tennis departments were included in the club, and it changed name to the present \"Odense Boldklub\". The club were then located in Munke Mose (The Monks bog) in Odense. OB moved to Ådalen in 1968, where the club still trains today.\n\nIn 1916, OB won the province championship for the first time and qualified to the semi-final of the Danish championship. They lost this match 3–9 to later champions B.93 from Copenhagen.\n\nWhen the Danish championship was reorganized after the Occupation of Denmark during World War II, OB were placed in the third best league, then named the Danish 3rd Division. After good help from the top goalscorers Svend Jørgen Hansen and Jørgen Leschly Sørensen, the club were quickly promoted to the best league. Svend Jørgen Hansen became OB's first Danish national team player in 1942, while Jørgen Leschly Sørensen was sold to the professional Italian team Atalanta in 1949.\n\nIn 1951, OB won their first medals, when the club won silver after runaway champions Akademisk Boldklub. Following the early success, it went down hill for the club. OB were relegated to the second-tier Danish 2nd Division in 1955, and the team had a hard time regaining its position in the top of Danish football. Despite promotions to the Danish 1st Division in 1957 and 1966, the club did not succeed to permanently stay in the top-flight until the promotion in 1975.\n\nIt did not help that the local rivals from B 1909 and B 1913 stayed in the top of the 1st Division in this period, where B 1909 won the 1959 and 1964 Danish championships. The intense local rivalry culminated in 1973, when 28,000 spectators watched the 2nd Division match between \"De Stribede\" and \"De røde\" (B 1909) on Odense Stadion. The match is still the spectator record for an OB home game.\n\nIn 1974, the club were in their first Danish Cup final, where the team lost 5–2 to Vanløse IF. Per Bartram from OB were awarded the title as \"Cup Fighter\".\n\nIn 1975, OB was once more promoted to the 1st Division. This time the club had the players to be a top team in the best league under the reign of coach Richard Møller Nielsen. Just two years later, OB won their first Danish championship in the 1977 season. OB's midfielder Allan Hansen was the top goalscorer in the 1st Division and he was awarded as 1977 Danish Player of the Year' award, a double triumph he repeated in 1981.\n\nThe championship win meant that OB played their first European matches in 1978. They competed in the 1978 European Cup, where they lost in the first round to Bulgarian side Lokomotiv Sofia.\n\nIn 1980, OB won bronze and the Danish championship was won for the second time in 1982. As Ricard Møller Nielsen's OB team were one of the dominating teams in Danish football in this period, B 1909 finished last in the 1982 1st Division, and were relegated to the 2nd Division. This made OB the best team of the Funen region. In 1983 OB took the cup to win their – so far – only \"The Double\" (with the 82' championship).\n\nThe team's success was built on many talented Danish players, counting 1982 \"Danish 1st Division Talent of the Year\" Keld Bordinggaard. The most prolific OB player of the era was goalkeeper Lars Høgh, who was a constant part of the team from 1977 to 1999 as he played a club record of 817 total matches for the first team.\n\nIn 1989, the club won the Danish championship again ahead of defending champions Brøndby IF under new manager Roald Poulsen. The profiles of Roald Poulsen's team included, apart from Lars Høgh, the midfielder Ulrik Moseby, the big defender Johnny Hansen, and the young forward Per Pedersen, who became the most expensive OB player sold, when he was bought by English team Blackburn Rovers for £2.3 million in 1997.\n\n1991 was a special year for OB. They won the Danish Cup final against AaB after two goalless matches, extra time and penalty shootout. As the national arena Idrætsparken were under reconstruction in 1991, the final was played home at Odense Stadion. The cup success was not matched in the league, now known as the Danish Superliga. After the main tournament of the 1991–92 season, OB was relegated to the Qualifying League.\n\nThey finished in second place of the 1992 Qualifying League, and OB were back in the Superliga for the 1992–93 season. In that season, the club won silver medals after F.C. Copenhagen and they won their third Danish Cup trophy in 1993.\n\nAs the Danish Football Association (DBU) restructured the Superliga before the 1995–96 season, and introduced a league format of 33 games spanning a full year; OB won bronze once more. Even though the team had many profiles and good players, the team lacked stability and in the 1997–98 season, and OB ended last with six season victories to suffer relegation to the second tier league, the Danish 1st Division.\n\nThe club were runaway winners of the 1999 1st Division and subsequently returned to the Superliga for the 1999–2000 season. OB won the 2002 Danish Cup with a 2–1 victory against Copenhagen at Parken Stadium. Since their promotion 1999, OB's best league performance has been second place, occurring in the 2008–09 season. In 2006, OB ended third, its first top-three finish in ten years. Furthermore, the club had fourth-place finishes in 2003, 2004 and 2007.\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, OB finished fourth in the league after a close race in the last rounds. Nonetheless, OB won the Danish Cup after defeating Copenhagen 2–1, which gave OB the opportunity to qualify for the UEFA Cup for the second-straight year.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, OB once again ended in fourth, which gave a chance to qualify to the UEFA Cup through the Intertoto Cup. On 19 and 26 July 2008, they played English side Aston Villa in the third round of the Intertoto Cup for the right to play in the second round of the UEFA Cup. OB managed a 2–2 home draw on 19 July, but a 1–0 away defeat on the 26 July resulted in a 2–3 aggregate loss to Villa.\n\nOB finished second in the 2008–09 season, which led to a two-game playoff with Genoa for participation in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. The first leg away at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris resulted in a 3–1 defeat, and the home game a 1–1 draw. In 2009–10, OB once again finished second in the league. After a fantastic start of the season the club disappointingly did not take the first place, due to a string of lost and drawn games in the spring of 2010. OB were drawn to face Scottish club Motherwell in the fourth qualifying round of the 2010–11 Europa League.\n\nIn the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, OB reached beyond the first round in a European tournament for the first time in club history. The team beat several opponents and most famously defeated Real Madrid to reach the quarter-final of the tournament.\n\nIn the first round, OB won both the home and away game 3–0 against Estonian Flora Tallinn. In the second round, they drew 1–1 in the away game against Northern Irish club Linfield and won 5–0 at home, including two long-range goals by defender Steen Nedergaard. In the third round, the played German team 1. FC Kaiserslautern, where OB managed a 1–1 draw in Germany and a 0–0 draw at home; OB advanced on the away goals rule.\n\nIn the fourth round, the opponent was Real Madrid, which at that time had Danish national team captain Michael Laudrup on the team. The first match was played at a sold-out Odense Stadion, and OB surprisingly scored on a corner kick in the first half. In the second half, Real Madrid quickly scored two goals, but OB managed to come back into the game, when they equalized to 2–2. Shortly before full-time, Real Madrid scored to 2–3, which was the final result of the game.\n\nDue to the away goals rule, OB needed to win with a margin of two goals to advance to the quarter-finals. Ulrik Pedersen scored for a 1–0 lead to OB, and with a good goalkeeping by Lars Høgh, OB kept Real Madrid from scoring. With a goal by Morten Bisgaard shortly before stoppage time, OB achieved the needed 2–0 victory, and advanced to the quarter-final. OB's victory attracted attention in great parts of Europe and in Denmark the event was named \"The Miracle in Madrid.\"\n\nIn the quarter-final, OB met Parma. In the first game away in Parma, OB and Lars Høgh almost prevented the Italians from scoring, but Steen Nedergaard committed a penalty which Parma converted and thus won the game 1–0. The second leg in Odense ended a 0–0 draw, which meant the end of OB's European adventure.\n\n\nOdense Boldklub Board\n\nCoaching and medical staff\n\n\nAt the clubs 125 year anniversary the fans elected the best OB players of all time. It was called De Største Striber (\"The Greatest Stripes\") and consists of 11 players and a coach. Each month in 2012 the fans voted for their favourite player, and in the end of the year the team was complete. The nominees was selected by Leif Rasmussen (Fyens Stiftstidende), Uffe Pedersen (OB), Anders Rørtoft Madsen (OB), Peter Borberg (author), Jacob Lind (previous chairman of the fanclub).\n\n\nCarlsberg was OB's main sponsor from 2001–2017, while hummel has been its kit sponsor since January 2016. Before that, Puma was the kit sponsor from the end of the 1970s to the end of the 1990s, and has been kit sponsor for every three league titles OB has won. When OB signed with Puma in 2008, the board was hoping that the history with Puma could achieve their ambition with two league titles before 2015.\n\nAfter 16 years with Carlsberg on the front of the shirt, OB changed main sponsor to Royal Unibrew. They signed a contract until 31 May 2023, and the new sponsor on the front of the shirt would become Albani Brewery, that is owned by Royal Unibrew. This came into force from the summer 2017.\n\n\"(As of 4 Oct 2014), Source: Bert Kassies website\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2061705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061705", "title": "Clinical audit", "text": "Clinical audit\n\nClinical audit is a process that has been defined as \"a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review of care against explicit criteria and the implementation of change\".\n\nThe key component of clinical audit is that performance is reviewed (or audited) to ensure that what you \"should\" be doing is \"being\" done, and if not it provides a framework to enable improvements to be made. It had been formally incorporated in the healthcare systems of a number of countries, for instance in 1993 into the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS), and within the NHS there is a clinical audit guidance group in the UK.\n\nClinical audit comes under the clinical governance umbrella and forms part of the system for improving the standard of clinical practice.\n\nThe first recorded medical audit was done by Sinan Ibnu Thabit, Chief Physician of Baghdad dan Abu Batiha al-Muhtasib (market inspector) at the request of Abbasid Caliph Al-Muqtadir after medical malpractice resulted in death of a patient. Following the investigation, the first medical licencing examination has been introduced, and only physicians who pass the exam can practice medicine. According to Ibnu Al-Ukhuwwa in his book, Ma'alim al-Qurba: fi Ahkam al-Hisba, \"If the patient is cured, the physician is paid. If the patient dies, his parents go to the chief doctor, they present the prescriptions written by the physician. If the chief doctor judges that the physician has performed his job perfectly without negligence, he tells the parents that death was natural; if he judges otherwise, he tells them: take the blood money of your relative from the physician; he killed him by his bad performance and negligence. In this honourable way they were sure that medicine is practiced by experienced, well-trained persons.\" \n\nOne of first clinical audits was undertaken by Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War of 1853–55. On arrival at the medical barracks hospital in Scutari in 1854, Nightingale was appalled by the unsanitary conditions and high mortality rates among injured or ill soldiers. She and her team of 38 nurses applied strict sanitary routines and standards of hygiene to the hospital and equipment; in addition, Nightingale had a talent for mathematics and statistics, and she and her staff kept meticulous records of the mortality rates among the hospital patients. Following these changes the mortality rates fell from 40% to 2%, and the results were instrumental in overcoming the resistance of the British doctors and officers to Nightingale's procedures. Her methodical approach, as well as the emphasis on uniformity and comparability of the results of health care, is recognised as one of the earliest programs of outcomes management.\n\nAnother notable figure who advocated clinical audit was Ernest Codman (1869–1940). Codman became known as the first true medical auditor following his work in 1912 on monitoring surgical outcomes. Codman's \"end result idea\" was to follow every patient's case history after surgery to identify errors made by individual surgeons on specific patients. Although his work is often neglected in the history of health care assessment, Codman's work anticipated contemporary approaches to quality monitoring and assurance, establishing accountability, and allocating and managing resources efficiently.\n\nWhilst Codman's 'clinical' approach is in contrast with Nightingale's more 'epidemiological' audits, these two methods serve to highlight the different methodologies that can be used in the process of improvement to patient outcome.\n\nDespite the successes of Nightingale in the Crimea and Codman in Massachusetts, clinical audit was slow to catch on. This situation was to remain for the next 130 or so years, with only a minority of healthcare staff embracing the process as a means of evaluating the quality of care delivered to patients.\n\nAs concepts of clinical audit have developed, so too have the definitions which sought to encapsulate and explain the idea. These changes generally reflect the movement away from the medico-centric views of the mid-Twentieth Century to the more multidisciplinary approach used in modern healthcare. It also reflects the change in focus from a professionally centred view of health provision to the view of the patient-centred approach. These changes can be seen from comparison of the following definitions.\n\n\nIn 1989, the white paper, \"Working for patients\", saw the first move in the UK to standardise clinical audit as part of professional healthcare. The paper defined medical audit (as it was called then) as\n\nMedical audit later evolved into clinical audit and a revised definition was announced by the NHS Executive:\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published the paper \"Principles for Best Practice in Clinical Audit\", which defines clinical audit as\n\nClinical audit was incorporated within Clinical Governance in the 1997 White Paper, \"The New NHS : Modern, Dependable\", which brought together disparate service improvement processes and formally established them into a coherent Clinical Governance framework.\n\n Clinical audit can be described as a cycle or a spiral, \"see figure\". Within the cycle there are stages that follow the \"systematic\" process of: establishing best practice; measuring against criteria; taking action to improve care; and monitoring to sustain improvement. As the process continues, each cycle aspires to a higher level of quality.\nThese processes are related to change management methodology and use the techniques of PDSA cycles, LEAN, Six Sigma, root cause analysis and process mapping.\n\nStage 1: Identify the problem or issue\n\nThis stage involves the selection of a topic or issue to be audited, and is likely to involve measuring adherence to healthcare processes that have been shown to produce best outcomes for patients. Selection of an audit topic is influenced by factors including:\n\nAdditionally, audit topics may be recommended by national bodies, such as NICE or the Healthcare Commission, in which NHS trusts may agree to participate. The Trent Accreditation Scheme recommends a culture of audit to participating hospitals inside and outside of the UK, and can provide advice on audit topics.\n\nStage 2: Define criteria and standards\n\nDecisions regarding the overall purpose of the audit, either as what should happen as a result of the audit, or what question you want the audit to answer, should be written as a series of statements or tasks that the audit will focus on. Collectively, these form the audit \"criteria\". These criteria are explicit statements that define what is being measured and represent elements of care that can be measured objectively. The \"standards\" define the aspect of care to be measured, and should always be based on the best available evidence.\n\n\nStage 3: Data collection\n\nTo ensure that the data collected are precise, and that only essential information is collected, certain details of what is to be audited must be established from the outset. These include:\n\n\nSample sizes for data collection are often a compromise between the statistical validity of the results and pragmatical issues around data collection. Data to be collected may be available in a computerised information system, or in other cases it may be appropriate to collect data manually or electronically using data capture solutions such as Formic, depending on the outcome being measured. In either case, considerations need to be given to what data will be collected, where the data will be found, and who will do the data collection.\n\nEthical issues must also be considered; the data collected must relate only to the objectives of the audit, and staff and patient confidentiality must be respected - identifiable information must not be used. Any potentially sensitive topics should be discussed with the local medical ethics committee.\n\nStage 4: Compare performance with criteria and standards\n\nThis is the analysis stage, whereby the results of the data collection are compared with criteria and standards. The end stage of analysis is concluding how well the standards were met and, if applicable, identifying reasons why the standards weren't met in all cases. These reasons might be agreed to be acceptable, i.e. could be added to the exception criteria for the standard in future, or will suggest a focus for improvement measures.\n\nIn theory, any case where the standard (criteria or exceptions) was not met in 100% of cases suggests a potential for improvement in care. In practice, where standard results were close to 100%, it might be agreed that any further improvement will be difficult to obtain and that other standards, with results further away from 100%, are the priority targets for action. This decision will depend on the topic area – in some ‘life or death’ type cases, it will be important to achieve 100%, in other areas a much lower result might still be considered acceptable.\n\nStage 5: Implementing change\n\nOnce the results of the audit have been published and discussed, an agreement must be reached about the recommendations for change. Using an action plan to record these recommendations is good practice; this should include who has agreed to do what and by when. Each point needs to be well defined, with an individual named as responsible for it, and an agreed timescale for its completion.\n\nAction plan development may involve refinement of the audit tool particularly if measures used are found to be inappropriate or incorrectly assessed. In other instances new process or outcome measures may be needed or involve linkages to other departments or individuals. Too often audit results in criticism of other organisations, departments or individuals without their knowledge or involvement. Joint audit is far more profitable in this situation and should be encouraged by the Clinical Audit lead and manager.\n\nRe-audit: Sustaining Improvements\n\nAfter an agreed period, the audit should be repeated. The same strategies for identifying the sample, methods and data analysis should be used to ensure comparability with the original audit. The re-audit should demonstrate that the changes have been implemented and that improvements have been made. Further changes may then be required, leading to additional re-audits.\n\nThis stage is critical to the successful outcome of an audit process - as it verifies whether the changes implemented have had an effect and to see if further improvements are required to achieve the standards of healthcare delivery identified in stage 2.\n\nResults of good audit should be disseminated both locally via the strategic health authorities and nationally where possible.\nProfessional journals, such as the BMJ and the Nursing Standard publish the findings of good quality audits, especially if the work or the methodology is generalisable.\n\nWhile clinical audit makes great sense, there can be problems in persuading hospitals and clinicians to undertake and apply clinical audit in their work. Nonetheless, in the UK clinical audit is one of the corpus of clinical governance measures that are required to be enacted throughout the NHS.\n\nOutside the UK, hospital accreditation schemes, such as the Trent Accreditation Scheme, have promoted the development and execution of clinical audit as a part of clinical governance in places such as Hong Kong and Malta.\n\n\n"}

The North Central dialect, often popularly though stereotypically recognized as a Minnesota accent, most strongly stretches from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to eastern Montana, including most of Wisconsin, the northern half of Minnesota, some of northern South Dakota, and most of North Dakota; however, many speakers of the dialect are also found scattered throughout Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Wisconsin (except for metropolitan Milwaukee), as well as in the northern half of Iowa.\n\nThe North Central dialect is considered to have developed in a residual dialect region from the neighboring distinct dialect regions of the American West, North, and Canada. A North Central \"dialect island\" exists in southcentral Alaska's Matanuska-Susitna Valley, since, in the 1930s, it absorbed large numbers of settlers from Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. \"Yooper\" English spoken in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Iron Range English spoken in Minnesota's Mesabi Iron Range are sub-varieties of the North Central dialect, largely influenced by Fenno-Scandinavian immigration to that area around the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nNot all of these characteristics are unique to the North Central region.\n\n\nNorth Central speech is rhotic. Th-stopping is possible among speakers of lower-class backgrounds. In addition, traces of a pitch accent as in Swedish and Norwegian can persist in some areas of heavy Norwegian or Swedish settlement, and among people who grew up in those areas (some of whom are not of Scandinavian descent). Also, sometimes the comparative form of adjectives are used in place of the root form of the adjective (e.g., saying \"the sky is bluer\" when the person means \"the sky is blue\" is common in Minnesota).\n\nThe appearance of monophthongs in this region is sometimes explained because of the high degree of Scandinavian and German immigration to these northern states in the late 1800s. Linguist Erik R. Thomas argues that these monophthongs are the product of language contact and notes that other areas where they occur are places where speakers of other languages have had an influence such as the Pennsylvania \"Dutch\" region. An alternative account posits that these monophthongal variants represent historical retentions, since diphthongization of the mid vowels seems to have been a relatively recent phenomenon in the history of the English language, appearing within the last few centuries, and did not affect all dialects in the U.K. The monophthongs heard in this region may stem from the influence of Scots-Irish or other British dialects that maintain such forms. The fact that the monophthongs also appear in Canadian English may lend support to this account since Scots-Irish speech is known as an important influence in Canada.\n\nPeople living in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (whose demonym, and sometimes sub-dialect, is known as \"Yooper,\" deriving from the acronym \"U.P.\" for \"Upper Peninsula\"), many northern areas of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, and in Northern Wisconsin are largely of Finnish, French Canadian, Cornish, Scandinavian, German, and/or Native American descent. The North Central dialect is so strongly influenced by these areas' languages and Canada that speakers from other areas may have difficulty understanding it. Almost half the Finnish immigrants to the U.S. settled in the Upper Peninsula, some joining Scandinavians who moved on to Minnesota. Another sub-dialect is spoken in Southcentral Alaska's Matanuska-Susitna Valley, because it was settled in the 1930s (during the Great Depression) by immigrants from the North Central dialect region.\n\nIn this dialect, the preposition \"with\" is used without an object as an adverb in phrases like \"come with\", as in \"Do you want to come with?\" for standard \"Do you want to come with me?\" or \"with us?\". In standard English, other prepositions can be used as adverbs, like \"go down\" (\"down\" as adverb) for \"go down the stairs\" (\"down\" as preposition). \"With\" is not typically used in this way in standard English (particularly in British and Irish English), and this feature likely came from languages spoken by some immigrants, such as Scandinavian (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian), German (includes Austrian), or Dutch (includes Flemish) and Luxembourgish, all of which have this construction, like Swedish \"kom med\".\n\n\n\nThe Upper Midwestern accent is made conspicuous, often to the point of parody or near-parody, in the film \"Fargo\" (especially as displayed by Frances McDormand's character Marge Gunderson) and the radio program \"A Prairie Home Companion\" (as displayed by many minor characters, especially those voiced by Sue Scott, with whom lead characters, most frequently male roles voiced by Garrison Keillor). It is also evident in the film \"New in Town\".\n\n\n"}

It forms the back part of the voice box and functions as an attachment site for muscles, cartilages, and ligaments involved in opening and closing the airway and in producing speech.\n\nThe cricoid cartilage sits just inferior to the thyroid cartilage in the neck, at the level of the C6 vertebra, and is joined to it medially by the median cricothyroid ligament and postero-laterally by the cricothyroid joints. Inferior to it are the rings of cartilage around the trachea (which are not continuous – rather they are C-shaped with a gap posteriorly). The cricoid is joined to the first tracheal ring by the cricotracheal ligament, and this can be felt as a more yielding area between the firm thyroid cartilage and firmer cricoid.\n\nIt is also anatomically related to the thyroid gland; although the thyroid isthmus is inferior to it, the two lobes of the thyroid extend superiorly on each side of the cricoid as far as the thyroid cartilage above it.\n\nThe posterior part of the cricoid is slightly broader than the anterior and lateral parts, and is called the lamina, while the anterior part is the band; this may be the reason for the common comparison made between the cricoid and a signet ring. The slender ventral half, and the most caudal of the palpable laryngeal landmarks, is also referred to as the anterior cricoid arch.\n\nIt is made of hyaline cartilage, and so can become calcified or even ossified, particularly in old age.\n\nThe function of the cricoid cartilage is to provide attachments for the cricothyroid muscle, posterior cricoarytenoid muscle and lateral cricoarytenoid muscle muscles, cartilages, and ligaments involved in opening and closing the airway and in speech production.\n\nWhen intubating a patient under general anesthesia prior to surgery, the anesthesiologist will press on the cricoid cartilage to compress the esophagus behind it so as to prevent gastric reflux from occurring: this is known as the Sellick manoeuvre. The Sellick Manoeuvre is typically only applied during a Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI), an induction technique reserved for those at high risk of aspiration.\n\nThe Sellick maneuver was considered the standard of care during rapid sequence induction for many years. The American Heart Association still advocates the use of cricoid pressure during resuscitation using a BVM, and during emergent oral endotracheal intubation. However, recent research increasingly suggests that cricoid pressure may not be as advantageous as once thought. The initial article by Sellick was based on a small sample size at a time when high tidal volumes, head-down positioning, and barbiturate anesthesia were the rule.\n\nCricoid pressure may frequently be applied incorrectly. Cricoid pressure may frequently displace the esophagus laterally, instead of compressing it as described by Sellick. Several studies demonstrate some degree of glottic compression reduction in tidal volume and increase in peak pressures. Based on the current literature, the widespread recommendation that cricoid pressure be applied during every rapid sequence intubation is quickly falling out of favor.\n\nGastric reflux could cause aspiration if this is not done considering the general anesthesia can cause relaxation of the gastroesophageal sphincter allowing stomach contents to ascend through the esophagus into the trachea.\n\nA medical procedure known as a cricoidectomy can be performed in which part or all of the cricoid cartilage is removed. This is commonly done to relieve blockages within the trachea.\n\nFractures of the cricoid cartilage can be seen after manual strangulation also known as throttling.\n\n\n"}

The word pisanka is derived from the verb 'pisać' which in contemporary Polish means exclusively 'to write' yet in old Polish meant also 'to paint'. Originating as a pagan tradition, pisanki were absorbed by Christianity to become the traditional Easter egg. Pisanki are now considered to symbolise the revival of nature and the hope that Christians gain from faith in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nThere are various types of pisanki, based on the technique and preparation used:\n\nKraszanki (sometimes called malowanki or byczki) are made by boiling an egg in a decoction of plants or other natural products. The colour of kraszanka depends on the kind of product used:\nDrapanki or skrobanki are made by scratching the surface of a \"kraszanka\" with a sharp tool to reveal the white of the egg shell.\nPacenka are created by drawing or painting. Traditional technique requires the egg shell to be covered with a layer of molten wax in which the pattern is scratched. The egg is then submerged into a dye. Finally, the wax preventing the dye to adhere to the eggshell is removed. Thus, the pattern is created in a manner similar to the sgraffito technique.\n\nNaklejanki or nalepianki are decorated with petals of elderberry, scraps of colourful paper (including wycinanki) or with patches of cloth. Popular in Łowicz and the surrounding area.\n\nOklejanki or wyklejanki are decorated with bulrush pith or yarn. They are common in the Podlaskie region of Poland.\n\nIn the past, only women decorated eggs. Men were not allowed to come inside the house during the process, as it was believed that they could put a spell on the eggs, and cause bad luck.\n\nToday in Poland, eggs and pisanki are hallowed on Easter Saturday along with the traditional Easter basket. On Easter Sunday, before the ceremonial breakfast, these eggs are exchanged and shared among the family at the table. This is a symbol of friendship, similar to the sharing of the Opłatek (Christmas wafer) on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n"}

Though the origin of its name is from the Punjabi word for marble (banta), Banta has been sold since the late 19th century, long before popular carbonated drinks arrived. The drink is often sold mixed with lemon juice, crushed ice, chaat masala and kala namak (black salt) as a carbonated variant of popular lemonades \"shikanjvi\" or \"jal-jeera\". It is available at street-sellers known as \"bantawallahs\" at prices ranging from - .\n\nBanta is popular across North India and especially the capital Delhi. In fact, it is known as \"Delhi’s local drink\", nimbu (lemon) soda or \"kanchay waali drink\" (\"kancha\" = marble in Hindi), especially in Old Delhi and the Delhi University college campuses. In South India it is known as \"Goli Soda\", due to the \"goli\" (marble) in neck of the bottle. The states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have a local variant known as \"panneer soda\" that is flavoured with rose essence.\n\nLike Ramune, a Japanese lemon drink, \"Banta\" is available in a Codd-neck bottle, a heavy glass bottle whose mouth is sealed by a round marble (instead of a cap) thanks to the pressure of the carbonated contents. The distinctive bottle has led to the drink also being called \"goli soda\" in South India.\n\nThe banta bottles are largely bottled by unorganized manufacturers, who sell bottles for as little as 2. Delhi itself has over 100 single-room bottling units. During the bottling process, a chemical flavouring agent known as Lemon No. 1 by International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF) is added. The agent is also used in ice cream and by the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nPrior to India's independence the Codd-neck bottles were imported from England, however post-independence local manufacturers came up including many factories in Ahmedabad. Today a major Codd-neck bottle manufacturer in India is Khandelwal Glass Works (since 1981) at Sasni, Uttar Pradesh, after Mahalakshmi Glass Works in Hyderabad closed down a few years ago. Before the re-entry of popular soft drinks like Pepsi and Coca-Cola in 1993, the sale of Banta reached its peak in the early 1990s, selling 100,000 bags per annum, with each bag containing 75 bottles. By 2010, however, the sales had dropped by nearly half, especially after reports of consumers experiencing nausea after consumption due to unsanitary conditions during production of the beverage.\n\n"}

The river itself was named for the Abenaki native people of the area who the French called \"les Etchemins\". The source of the river is not Etchemin Lake but rather a little east of the lake, in Saint-Luc-de-Bellechasse.\n\nThe Etchemin River, which had become been the victim of pollution for decades, became the topic of conversation in 1993, when a few residents of Saint-Léon-de-Standon began to work on a project to revive the Atlantic salmon in the river. The project was scoffed at in the beginning; damming, logging along the Etchemin's shore, agricultural runoff and dumping had polluted the river so much that the last Atlantic salmon had been last seen there some two centuries ago. Although the odds were against them, the locals from different riverbank communities began work on the river. They formed the Comité de restauration de la rivière Etchemin (CRRE). Work then began on planting over 15,000 trees on the riverbanks, making salmon-friendly rapids and shelters for spawning. In 2002, the first adult Atlantic salmon was spotted in the river.\n\n"}

It stretches from the coast at Beachport east to the Victorian border. It had a population of over 11,000 as at the 2016 Census.\n\nThe council is divided into four wards; \"Kintore\", \"Riddoch\", \"Sorby Adams\" and \"Corcoran\" wards, with two or more councillors representing each ward. The council seat is located at Millicent.\n\nThe aboriginal people of the region were composed of five powerful tribes, each occupying its own territory which was strictly defined, and territorial rights guarded jealously. Each had different dialects and the names of the tribes were Bungandidj, Pinegunga, Mootatunga, Wichitunga and Polingunga, of which the first was the most powerful. The tract of country occupied by the Booandik extended from the mouth of the Glenelg River to Rivoli Bay North (Beachport) for about 30 miles inland.\n\nEuropean settlers first moved into the area in the late 1840s, and by the 1860s opened up tracts of land for farming cereal crops. Beachport became an important port during the 1880s, further increasing the population of the area. The first local government areas were set up around the three towns of Millicent, Penola and Beachport in the late 19th century, with each operating independently of each other until 1997.\nThe Wattle Range Council was formed in 1997 from the amalgamation of the District Council of Beachport, the District Council of Millicent and the District Council of Penola.\n\nThe council includes the towns and localities of Beachport, Burrungule, Comaum, Coonawarra, Furner, German Flat, Glencoe, Glenroy, Hatherleigh, Kalangadoo, Kangaroo Inn, Koorine, Krongart, Maaoupe, Magarey, Millicent, Moerlong, Monbulla, Mount Burr, Mount McIntyre, Nangwarry, Penola, Rendelsham, Rocky Camp, Sebastopol, Short, Southend, Thornlea, Wattle Range and Wattle Range East, and parts of Bool Lagoon, Bray, Canunda, Clay Wells, Nora Creina, Tantanoola and Wepar.\n\nThe local economy is dependent on wide range of activities, with agriculture, fishing, forestry and tourism making up the major components.\n\nSheep and cattle farming are the prominent agricultural venture, with dairy farming common also. Cereal cropping is also prevalent in the nutrient-rich soils of the South East.\n\nViticulture is well established in the council area, with one of South Australia's premier wine growing regions, the Coonawarra wine region, located in its bounds, with rich terra rossa soil aiding the wine quality.\n\nForestry and milling have also been important to the district, with processing plants at Nangwarry and Millicent.\n\nTourism is a diverse, growing aspect of the economy, with seaside towns such as Beachport attracting tourists for the seaside atmosphere, and others such as Coonawarra, for the wine growing industry. A niche tourism activity is cave diving in the water-filled caves and sinkholes present in the southern part of the council's area as well as in the adjoining local government area of the District Council of Grant. This activity attracts cave divers from around the globe. Popular sites include \"Fossil Cave\", \"Pines\" and \"Tank Cave\". \n\nWattle Range Council has a directly elected mayor. A councillor is appointed by council as deputy mayor at the start of each term in office.\n\n"}

{"id": "2061807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061807", "title": "Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)", "text": "Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)\n\nBiblia Hebraica refers primarily to the three editions of the Hebrew Bible edited by Rudolf Kittel. When referenced, Kittel's \"Biblia Hebraica\" is usually abbreviated BH, or BHK (K for Kittel). When specific editions are referred to, BH1, BH2 and BH3 are used. \"Biblia Hebraica\" is a Latin phrase meaning Hebrew Bible, traditionally used as a title for printed editions of the Tanakh. Less commonly, \"Biblia Hebraica\" may also refer to subsequent editions in the \"Biblia Hebraica\" series which build on the work of Kittel's editions.\n\nThe Old Testament scholar Rudolf Kittel from Leipzig started to develop a critical edition of the Hebrew Bible in 1901, which would later become the first of its kind. His first edition \"Biblia Hebraica edidit Rudolf Kittel\" was published as a two-volume work in 1906 under the publisher J. C. Hinrichs in Leipzig.\n\nAs a textual basis for his edition he reproduced the Hebrew text found in the \"Mikraot Gedolot\" (also cited as \"Bombergiana\" or \"formula_1\"), the rabbinic Bible from Jacob ben Hayyim ibn Adonijah printed by Daniel Bomberg in Venice in 1524/1525 which had been generally accepted as the representative Hebrew text for centuries up to that point. Kittel printed the text with the Hebrew consonants, vowels (Niqqud) and Cantillation marks as found in the Bomberg Bible, although his editions did not include Masoretic notes, whereas the Bomberg edition did.\n\nIn the bottom part of the page he added his critical apparatus where he listed textual variants from other ancient manuscripts (especially the Septuagint; but also from the Samaritan Pentateuch and early Bible translations such as the Latin Vulgate and Syriac Peshitta) and conjectural emendations.\n\nThe second edition of Kittel's \"Biblia Hebraica\" appeared in 1913; the differences between it and the first one are slight, apart from a list of errors in the second. It was reprinted several times.\n\nIn 1921 the Bible Society Württemberg (\"Württembergische Bibelanstalt\") bought the rights for Kittel's \"Biblia Hebraica\" from J. C. Hinrichs and alongside further reprints of the existing edition, approaches for a third edition were planned from 1925 onwards. The third edition had a slightly different Hebrew text and completely revised footnotes. For the first time, a Bible reproduced the text of the Leningrad Codex from the year 1008, since it was (and still is) the oldest existing manuscript of the entire Hebrew Bible. The idea to use that Codex is credited to Paul Kahle, who discovered its importance. The BH reproduces the Masoretic Text in the Codex exactly, without any editing.\n\nThe critical apparatus was separated into two different categories, \"mere variants and less important notifications\" (in German: \"bloße Varianten und minder wichtige Mitteilungen\") and \"the actual textual changes and otherwise more considerable things\" (in German: \"die wirklichen Textänderungen und das sonst Bedeutsamere\") to inform the reader of the emphasis in the list of variants.\n\nIn its approach to reproduce the Leningrad Codex it also featured for the first time the Masoretic notes found on the left and right margins of the Codex, the so-called \"Masora Parva\", although without any explanations to it. These marginal notes were of great importance to the editors of the subsequent editions (the BHS began to redact the \"Masora Parva\" and also to implement references to the notes on the top and bottom of the page, the so-called \"Masora Magna\").\n\nBH appeared in installments, from 1929 to 1937, with the first one-volume edition in 1937; it was reprinted many times, with later editions recording variants in the Book of Isaiah and Habakkuk from the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nSome of the references in the textual apparatus reference manuscripts that no longer exist due to the bombing of Leipzig during World War II.\n\nThe third edition was superseded by the \"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia\". The current project in this tradition is the \"Biblia Hebraica Quinta\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2061810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061810", "title": "Nightmare Creatures", "text": "Nightmare Creatures\n\nNightmare Creatures is a 1997 survival horror video game developed by Kalisto Entertainment for PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo 64. A sequel, \"Nightmare Creatures II\", was released three years later. A mobile phone version of \"Nightmare Creatures\" was developed and published by Gameloft in 2003.\n\nThe story behind \"Nightmare Creatures\" draws upon gothic horror elements of the 19th century. The story begins in 1666, when a devil-worshiping cult called the Brotherhood of Hecate were conducting sinister experiments in London so as to take over the city, and then the world. The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments instead created grotesque monsters called nightmare creatures. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their members, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London.\n\nThe game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking among the living. All of London is in a panic and vulnerable to the schemes of Adam Crowley, a mad scientist and occultist enlisting the help of the Brotherhood.\n\nA book is dropped off at the home of Ignatius Blackward, a priest and occult expert. He finds it is the lost diary of Samuel Pepys, which contains the Brotherhood's research. Knowing he needs help, Ignatius sends the diary to a renowned American immunologist named Dr. Jean Franciscus of New Orleans, who shows up with his daughter, Nadia Franciscus. With the doctor murdered and the book stolen, Ignatius and Nadia are at his funeral, where they are approached by a man who gives them a note reading: \"Know about Adam Crowley, Brotherhood of Hecate --- HVHJ.\" Ignatius and Nadia head out to an address listed on the note, hoping to seek out Crowley and neutralize the monsters.\n\nA single-player only game, \"Nightmare Creatures\" allows the player to control either Ignatius or Nadia. Secondary weapons such as pistols, mines, fire bombs, and magic spells can be used in addition to each character's primary weapon. The game features an optional adrenaline bar which causes health to be lost if it runs out, and players are forced to continuously seek out and win battles to keep the adrenaline bar full.\n\n\"Nightmare Creatures\" was the first video game to be created with LibSys, Kalisto's own proprietary 3D development program. The game's environments were modeled from 19th century maps and blueprints.\n\nBidding for the game's publication rights was reportedly fierce. Initially Mindscape was slated to be the publisher, but the publication rights to \"Nightmare Creatures\" were acquired by Activision just before the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo. \"Nightmare Creatures\" was published by Activision in North America and Sony Computer Entertainment in Europe.\n\nIn North America the PlayStation version was promoted with a television commercial featuring a voice-over by Maurice LaMarche.\n\nWhile the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows versions are essentially the same, the Nintendo 64 version saw a handful of minor changes. Given the limited storage capacity of the Nintendo 64's cartridge system, all full-motion videos were removed. Brief segments of scrolling text are used at the game's start and following each level to advance the plot. The platforming elements were made much easier in the Nintendo 64 version, and the health-depleting adrenaline meter could also be turned off in the options menu, allowing players to explore the environments at a more leisurely pace. Also graphically, the Nintendo 64 version is more crisp, clear and detailed than the PlayStation version, without the pixelization and texture-warping.\n\nThe PlayStation version was released in Japan on February 26, 1998.\n\n\"Nightmare Creatures\" was a commercial hit, with global sales above 1.5 million units by January 2000.\n\nThe PlayStation version of \"Nightmare Creatures\" received \"favorable\" reviews, while the Nintendo 64 and PC versions received \"mixed\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.\n\nThe PlayStation release divided critics. They almost uniformly praised the game's spooky atmosphere and the monster designs, though many found that the controls had issues and the camera, while effective the vast majority of the time, would occasionally frustrate the player with a poor view of the action. However, they were evenly split on whether to recommend the game, with some saying that the fighting gets old quickly, making it an overall disappointment in light of the promise it showed during development, and some saying that the game's flaws are minor compared to its strengths. \"Next Generation\" stated that \"While the visuals are compelling enough to drive many players forward, the repetitive action is enough to make most wait for a level select code and a weekend rental.\" Taking the other side, \"IGN\" concluded, \"Ultimately, the positives far outweigh the negatives in \"Nightmare Creatures\". It's spooky, challenging, and a hell of a lot of fun.\"\n\nThe division between recommendations stemmed at least partially from differing experiences with the game's extensive move sets. For example, \"GameSpot\" stated that \"Since the more complex moves are significantly harder to pull off (especially with those attacking creatures interfering and all), you'll end up jamming on the kick or slash buttons with an occasional block or dodge.\" On the other side, \"GamePro\" said even the more elaborate combos \"are a breeze to perform\", and give the game a 4.5 out of 5 for control and a perfect 5.0 in every other category (graphics, sound, and fun factor). They summarized that \"With its speedy gameplay and fast-moving enemy interaction, not to mention the intense, creepy nature of the backgrounds, \"Nightmare Creatures\" is sure to haunt your dreams for months to come.\" The disagreement extended between \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s four reviewers; Sushi-X and Kelly Rickards gave the game a 8.0 and 7.5, respectively, saying that the special attacks are all easy to perform and useful in combat, while Joe Fielder and Crispin Boyer both gave it a 5.5, with Fielder arguing that the player is driven to either button mashing or sticking to a handful of basic moves and Boyer saying the game is too difficult unless the player quickly masters the use of the block. Critics overwhelmingly agreed that the game is extremely difficult (though some of them considered this a positive rather than a negative).\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"\"Nightmare Creatures\" does grow bland after the first few levels, but the variety of items and new combos keep the game from diving into tedium. All in all, it's a welcome addition to the N64.\"\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the game a B-, praising the 3D environments, and saying \"\" is dated and flat in comparison.\n\nOn 8 December 2000, a film adaptation based on the game was announced, but never went into production.\n\n"}

His mother was Emperor Xiaozong's first wife, Lady Guo (郭氏; 1126–1156), who was posthumously honoured as \"Empress Chengmu\" (成穆皇后). His reign was relatively peaceful, but his lack of filial piety eventually made officials replace him with his son Emperor Ningzong.\n\nDuring his childhood, Guangzong either suffered from bipolar or severe neurosis.

ICAP is generally used to implement virus scanning and content filters in transparent HTTP proxy caches. Content adaptation refers to performing the particular value added service (content manipulation) for the associated client request/response.\n\nICAP concentrates on leveraging edge-based devices (caching proxies) to help deliver value-added services. At the core of this process is a cache that will proxy all client transactions and will process them through web servers. These ICAP servers are focused on a specific function, for example, ad insertion, virus scanning, multi-AV scanning, content translation, language translation, or content filtering. Off-loading value-added services from web servers to ICAP servers allows those same web servers to be scaled according to raw HTTP throughput versus having to handle these extra tasks.\n\nICAP was proposed in late 1999 by Peter Danzig and John Schuster from Network Appliance. Don Gillies took over the project in the spring of 2000 and enhanced the protocol in three main ways:\nGillies prototyped the first ICAP client and server for the NetCache series of internet caches in mid-2000 (known as ICAP 0.9 protocol) and produced training materials for vendors. The client was written in C++ in the core of the NetCache server, and the demonstration ICAP Server was written in Perl and employed the Debian word-replacement filters to rewrite web pages, skipping over the HTML tags, and translating web pages into Swedish Chef or Jive in real time. With knowledge learned from the prototyping experience, Gillies revised the IETF draft standard to make RPCs using only chunked encoding, greatly simplifying the ICAP protocol.\n\n"}

Many varieties use chocolate syrup instead, and some may contain dark or milk chocolate.\n\nCaffè mocha, in its most basic formulation, can also be referred to as hot chocolate with (e.g., a shot of) espresso added. Like cappuccino, caffè mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top, although, as is common with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon, sugar or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavor and decoration.\n\nA variant is white caffè mocha, made with white chocolate instead of milk or dark. There are also variants of the drink that mix the two syrups; this mixture is referred to by several names, including black and white mocha, marble mocha, tan mocha, tuxedo mocha, and zebra.\n\nAnother variant is a mochaccino which is an espresso shot (double) with either a combination of steamed milk and cocoa powder or chocolate milk. Both mochaccinos and caffè mocha can have chocolate syrup, whipped cream and added toppings such as cinnamon, nutmeg or chocolate sprinkles.\n\nA third variant on the caffè mocha is to use a coffee base instead of espresso.

Although the group was considered by some senior officers in the Greater Manchester Police to be the instigators of much of Manchester's major crime, many others believed that the gang was nothing more than a social friendship between a group of men, most of whom had criminal records. Certainly in the 20 or so years that the group was supposedly organising the city's crime, none of its alleged members was ever convicted of serious crimes.\n\nThe Quality Street Gang was reportedly named after an advertisement for Quality Street confectionery which featured a group of fashionably dressed people: as the \"gang\" walked into a pub, a wag supposedly shouted \"It's the Quality Street Gang\" and the name stuck. Another story says the name came about because most of the gang members were overweight.\n\nThe gang was at one point attached to a story about the Kray twins coming to Manchester to expand their interests outside London, but being turned around at Manchester Piccadilly station and put back on the train to the capital. In 2008 Daniel Flood gave evidence in a High Court hearing that his father, Douglas Firkin-Flood, had been a member of the gang who had been involved in the fight, although the claim was later denied by Floods's son, Ian, who pointed out that several conflicting versions of the story exist. The former gangster associated with the Krays, Frankie Fraser, doubts that the incident ever happened, as the Krays travelled exclusively by car and were uninterested in expanding their territory outside London.\n\nManchester United football hooligan Colin Blaney has said that members of the Quality Street Gang had links to a criminal element within the gang of hooligans associated with that club, which was known as the Inter City Jibbers, and carried out armed robberies together in Holland. The book includes a photograph alleged to show a Quality Street Gang member at the wedding of Inter City Jibbers member John \"The Grid\" McKee, whom Blaney alleges was also heavily involved in the Dutch underworld.\n\nIn 1986, John Stalker, then Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, was suspended over accusations that, among other things, he had attended social events at which members of the gang were present. Stalker was later cleared.\n\nAlex Murphy referred to Salford's successful rugby league team of the 1960s and 1970s as the Quality Street Gang, a reference to the money spent on transfer fees.\n\nThe Thin Lizzy song \"The Boys Are Back In Town\" is believed to be a reference to the Quality Street Gang, as also was their song \"Johnny the Fox Meets Jimmy the Weed\". Jimmy the Weed was the nickname for Jimmy Donnelly, who was for many years associated with the gang. Philomena Lynott, the mother of Phil Lynott, the singer/songwriter of the band, ran the Clifton Grange Hotel in Whalley Range at the time and it was there that some of the alleged gang members met, along with showbusiness people and sports stars such as George Best. The band became friendly with these people.\n\n"}

It is named after the British physicist and engineer Lord Kelvin and after German physicist Woldemar Voigt.\n\nThe Kelvin-Voigt model, also called the Voigt model, can be represented by a purely viscous damper and purely elastic spring connected in parallel as shown in the picture.\n\nIf, instead, we connect these two elements in series we get a model of a Maxwell material.\n\nSince the two components of the model are arranged in parallel, the strains in each component are identical:\n\nwhere the subscript D indicates the stress-strain in the damper and the subscript S indicates the stress-strain in the spring. Similarly, the total stress will be the sum of the stress in each component:\n\nFrom these equations we get that in a Kelvin-Voigt material, stress σ, strain ε and their rates of change with respect to time \"t\" are governed by equations of the form:\n\nor, in dot notation:\n\nwhere \"E\" is a modulus of elasticity and formula_5 is the viscosity. The equation can be applied either to the shear stress or normal stress of a material.\n\nIf we suddenly apply some constant stress formula_6 to Kelvin-Voigt material, then the deformations would approach the deformation for the pure elastic material formula_7 with the difference decaying exponentially:\n\nwhere \"t\" is time and formula_9 the rate of relaxation formula_10. Conversely, the value formula_11 is known as the retardation time.\n\nIf we would free the material at time formula_12, then the elastic element would retard the material back until the deformation becomes zero. The retardation obeys the following equation:\n\nThe picture shows the dependence of the dimensionless deformation formula_14 \non dimensionless time formula_15. In the picture the stress on the material is loaded at time formula_16, and released at the later dimensionless time formula_17.\nSince all the deformation is reversible (though not suddenly) the Kelvin–Voigt material is a solid.\n\nThe Voigt model predicts creep more realistically than the Maxwell model, because in the infinite time limit the strain approaches a constant:\n\nwhile a Maxwell model predicts a linear relationship between strain and time, which is most often not the case. Although the Kelvin-Voigt model is effective for predicting creep, it is not good at describing the relaxation behavior after the stress load is removed.\n\nThe complex dynamic modulus of the Kelvin-Voigt material is given by:\n\nThus, the real and imaginary components of the dynamic modulus are:\n\nNote that formula_22 is constant, while formula_23 is directly proportional to frequency (where the apparent viscosity, formula_5, is the constant of proportionality).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2061867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061867", "title": "Rex mutation", "text": "Rex mutation\n\nThe rex mutation is a genetic variation in mammals that results in soft curly fur. These effects are due\nto changes in the structure of groups of hairs and cross-section of individual hairs. The Rexed coats are unusual but occur (and have been preserved) in cats, rats, rabbits, horses, and dogs. The mutations, infrequent and spontaneous, occur in a variety of genes and genetic regulatory structures. The diversity of genetic factors results in variable coat thickness/density and fur length.\n\nA great variety exists within rex rabbits. They vary from very dense and short-haired varieties (Standard Rex) to long-haired curly-haired breeds (Astrex).\n\nThe rex rabbit was introduced in 1919 by Abbe Gillet from a spontaneous mutation. The next rex rabbit was discovered in the hutches of a breeder in Lübeck, Germany in 1926. This breed was originally called Deutsch-Kurzhaar and is due to the r2 (dek) gene. In 1927, yet another short-hair rabbit was discovered in the hutches of the French breeder Madame Du Bary, a fancier of Himalayan (ch-) rabbits. This breed was called Normannen-Kurzhaar and is due to the r3 (nok) gene.\nOf the 3 genetic sources of rex rabbits, the one due to the gene r1 is the most popular with fanciers and has the simple Mendelian inheritance pattern of autosomal recessive. It was not linked with any other genes known at the time although it was eventually found to be in the same linkage group as r2.\nThe phenotype of r1 and r2 is a completely normal coat but r1 or r2 alone produces a short coat with curly whiskers. Although the phenotypes are identical for each gene, the linkage distance was eventually worked out. \nThe gene r3 is independent of r1 and r2 in breeding tests so they fall on different chromosomes. \nThe mutation associated with r1 was recently studied using modern genetic tools. A deletion of a single nucleotide was found in LIPH (lipase member H gene) of rex rabbits. In humans, this gene is associated with alopecia (hair loss phenotypes). This mutation results in a frameshift that causes the mRNA transcription machinery to sense the end of the gene prematurely. The stop codon generated by the deletion may be shortening the protein by 19 amino acids. The exact mechanism was not determined but the deletion is necessary and sufficient for the rex phenotype.\n\nSee more information about Oryctolagus cuniculis genetics here.\n\nThere are four main internationally recognised rex breeds: Cornish Rex, Devon Rex, LaPerm, and Selkirk Rex.\n\nThere are also a number of rarer, less well known or developing rex-coated breeds, including the German Rex, Ural Rex, Tennessee Rex, Tasman Rex group and Skookum. Spontaneous rexed variants have also been observed in breeds such as the Maine Coon and Persian as well as in random-bred cats such as the Ohio Rex, Oregon Rex and California Rex, however there has been no significant attempt to develop or seek recognition for these varieties and most have died out. A number of experimental breeds have been developed from the main 4 rex breeds, such as the German-bred Pudelkatze (Poodle Cat), now believed to be extinct. The Tennessee Rex is a natural mutation breed of cat dating back to 2004. It was discovered by Franklin Whittenburg.\n\nRex breeds vary considerably in appearance, from the elegant slender build of the Cornish Rex to the larger, cobby and heavy-boned Selkirk Rex. Each results from a separate mutation rather than being bred from a common ancestor. Each mutation causes the hair follicles to be oval in shape, instead of the normal regular round form, which results in hairs curling round as they grow instead of growing straight. Many of the other spontaneously occurring rex mutations have occurred and some have proven to be the same gene as the main four breeds. Some of those mutations, such as the Dutch Rex, were found to have unmanageable or unattractive fur and were not pursued as breeds.\n\nThe name Rex was taken from the Rabbit Fancy because the first rex cat breed to be developed, the Cornish Rex, has a coat similar to that of a rex rabbit, in that it comprises only the undercoat with no topcoat or guard hairs.\n\n\nRex Syrian Hamsters first appeared in the 1970s, it's characterised by Curly Whiskers and a Curly Coat, the curls in the coat are easily visible in Short Coated Hamsters but more difficult to see in Long Coated Hamsters.\n\nRex in Campbell Dwarf Hamsters isn't recorded as to when it first appeared. Unlike with Syrian Hamsters, the Rex Coat in Campbell is commonly very sparse and gives a bald appearance to it. The whiskers are curled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2061874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061874", "title": "Wine accessory", "text": "Wine accessory\n\nA wine accessory is generally any equipment that may be used in the storing or serving of wine. Wine accessories include many items such as wine glasses, corkscrews, and wine racks.\n\nWine glasses are a type of glass stemware that are used to drink and taste wine from. Selection of a particular wine glass for a wine style is important, as the glass shape can influence its perception.\n\nWine bottle openers are required to open wine bottles that are stoppered with a cork. They are slowly being supplanted by the screwcap closure. There are many different inceptions of the wine bottle opener ranging from the simple corkscrew, the screwpull lever, to complicated carbon dioxide driven openers. The most popular is the wine key, sommelier knife or \"waiter's friend\" which resembles a pocket knife and has a small blade for cutting foil and a screw with a bottle brace.\n\nWine poppers are another means of opening wine. A hollow spike is driven through the cork of a bottle. A cartridge of carbon dioxide is then pressed to release a short burst of gas. The sudden increase of pressure dislodges the cork and the wine can then be served. Two problems can arise with this method: synthetic \"corks\" may be too dense to penetrate, and bottles not intended for pressure may break.\n\n\"Wine coolers\" (any type of equipment used in the chilling or cooling of wine) may include:\n\n\nA wine decanter is a glass serving vessel into which an entire bottle of wine is poured. They are used to remove sediment, aerate the wine, facilitate pouring, and provide elegant presentation. Decanters are important when serving older vintages which are more likely to accumulate potassium bitartrate crystal sediment in the process of aging; these can be removed both by filtering when pouring into the decanter – so that the wine in the decanter is sediment-free – or due to the shape of the decanter (flared bottom), which catches sediment. Decanters promote the aeration of wine by having a flared bottom, hence large surface area of wine, maximising the wine-air interface, thereby introducing more oxygen which changes the wine's bouquet and taste – it also allows the evaporation of undesirable organic compounds, particularly sulfides and sulfites; this use is controversial, and some argue that this is unnecessary and harmful, with swirling the wine in the glass being sufficient and preferable. Because they are a serving vessel, not a storage vessel, they also can make wine pouring easier by preventing dribbling, and elegantly display the wine's color in clear glass, rather than the green glass used for storage.\n\nFurther accessories such as decanting cradles or decanting machines exist to facilitate decanting.\n\nWine funnels aid the decanting process by funnelling the wine into a decanter. Wine funnels are fitted with a gauze or mesh to trap natural deposits in the bottle.\nWine racks are storage devices that hold wine bottles in an orientation facilitating long term wine aging. Most wine racks are designed for a bottle to be stored on its side, with a slight slant downward towards the bottle's neck. This ensures that wine is always in contact with the cork, preventing the cork from drying out and the subsequent ingress of oxygen, which would ultimately spoil the wine. Wine racks can be made of many materials such as wood, steel, and stone, holding just several bottles to thousands. These racks also serve as decorative pieces in many homes.\n\nA wine collar is a wine accessory that fits around the neck of a wine bottle. When in place it absorbs any drip that may run down the bottle after pouring. This is beneficial for preventing stains to surfaces that the bottle comes in contact with such as table cloths or counter tops. Wine collars are also called \"drip rings\" or \"drip collars\". There are two branded wine collars, one called a Drip Dickey and the other called a \"Winewoggle\"; both are registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nDesigns for this simple accessory have varied for over a hundred years. In 1872, W.R. Miller was issued a patent for a \"drip cup\", which formed a circular gutter that would catch the fluid. The most recognized wine collar today is typically a plastic or silver ring with an interior lining of red or black felt. When slipped over the neck of the bottle the felt absorbs the drip.\n\nA wine stopper is an essential wine accessory to close leftover wine bottles before refrigerating them. Wine stoppers are used because it is hard to put the original cork back into the bottleneck.\n\nWine stoppers vary in shapes, sizes, and materials. The three typical types are the cork wine stopper, rubber wine stopper, and plastic wine stopper. All these wine stoppers look very different, especially the top. The top part can be made from plastic, wood, or even precious metals and crystals. However the bottom part of the stoppers are primarily made of the above 3 typical materials, and newer versions of wine stoppers are made to expand in the wine glass to ensure a tighter seal.\nSome wine stoppers can be vacuum-sealed with a hand pump, to remove oxygen from the bottle, thereby extending the life of the wine by several days after opening the bottle.\n\nA wine journal is a journal for recording notes on wine consumed or tasted. It provides a catalogue for the wine enthusiast to record information such as producer, region, vintage, price, date, name of store or restaurant, ranking and tasting notes for wine, champagne and liquors for future review. Some journals offer a space for pasting in the label.\n\nA simple, informal method of wine journaling is to take photos of wine labels. This is considerably easier today due to the prevalence of compact digital cameras and camera phones.\n\nA wine thief is a glass or food-grade plastic pipette used in the process of wine making. It may be anywhere from in length and may have a bend near one end. The wine thief is used to remove a small amount of wine from a cask, carboy, or other fermentation device for testing.\n\nHome winemakers may also use a wine thief in connection with a length of tubing to siphon wine from one container to the other (a process called \"racking\") or to transfer the wine to bottles.\n\nA tastevin is a small, very shallow silver cup or saucer traditionally used by winemakers and sommeliers when judging the maturity and taste of a wine.\n\nThe saucer-like cups were originally created by Burgundian winemakers to enable them to judge the clarity and color of wine that was stored in dim, candle-lit wine cellars. Regular wine glasses were too deep to allow for accurate judging of the wine's color in such faint light. Tastevins are designed with a shiny faceted inner surface. Often, the bottom of the cup is convex in shape. The facets, convex bottom, and the shiny inner surface catch as much available light as possible, reflecting it throughout the wine in the cup, making it possible to see through the wine.\n\nWith the advent of modern electric lights, tastevins have very little practical use, although sommeliers often wear them on a ribbon or chain around the neck as a nod to tradition.\n\nWine cups or tastevins are mentioned occasionally in European inventories from 1200 to 1600. Around 1680, silver cups about 3–4 inches in diameter and 1–2 inches deep came into use in France by affluent people. The custom spread and they came into general use among the wealthy around 1720–1750. They were made by master silversmiths, and were often decorated and engraved with the owner's name. Their size and shape allowed them to be carried in a pocket at all times, and they were prized possessions like rings or watches. Each region in France had its own characteristic style. They were mostly male possessions, but in Normandy about 15 per cent were engraved with women's names.\n\nAt that time, wine was sold in barrels and served in pitchers. Wine bottles were very little used before 1800. Diners and guests carried their own knives, and ate with their fingers. Louis XIV refused to use the fork which had become fashionable in Italy, so the use of forks didn't even begin in France until about 1730. One could drink using a wooden or terra cotta cup provided by the host, but carrying your own cup was more sanitary and more distinguished.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, the general use of these cups died out, but winemakers and traders continued their use. After 1840 the design was mostly standardized to the type shown in the illustration above. A few tastevins were made and used in countries other than France, but only a few. In the twentieth century sommeliers in upscale restaurants sometimes carried tastevins around their necks with a ribbon or chain, and used them to check wine after opening the bottle. That custom has largely died out, but is occasionally still seen in the twenty-first century.\n\nA wine aerator is a small, in-bottle, hand-held pour-through or decanter top device for aerating wine. These devices mix air into the wine as it flows through or over, increasing exposure to oxygen and causing aeration. They offer an alternative to swirling, traditional decanting, and to aldouze (i.e. to wait for wine to breathe). This category emerged in the United States in or before 2007. This timing can be partially linked to the decline of the US economy which resulted in wineries releasing wine early to compensate for sales dips.\n\nThere are a number of styles of wine aerators and approaches to accomplish aeration. While injection-style hand-held acrylic aerators are currently most common, in-bottle and decanter top aerators are also available. Sieve-style decanter top funnels have long been used for aeration and catching sediment. Aerators are made from food safe-plastic or glass, and decanter top aerators are commonly stainless steel.\n\nInjection-style aerators work by the Venturi effect, an application of Bernoulli's principle: they feature a wide tube that narrows. This effect is widely used in engineering applications, for example to mix air and fuel in carburetors. This method has been noted by wine experts to be too harsh for thinner skinned verietals such as Pinot noir or Gamay.\n\nBoxed wine and vacuumed sealed wine can be aerated through the use of a single glass aerator. There are a number of different types of single glass aerators. Some have a movable spout that adjusts to the different size and shape of a wine glass.\n\nDecanter-top aerators are the longest used and the most varied in design. Variations on the metal funnel are common, as are shapes and figures placed in the decanter neck. Pouring over the object creates agitation.\n\nA now-rare device, the champagne stirrer or champagne swizzle stick is a stick. They are often ornamental and made of silver, ivory, or crystal, and often with a flayed end (like a branch), which is placed or stirred in champagne to reduce or remove the bubbles. Its use is heavily frowned upon as it destroys the most valued and distinctive aspect of champagne, namely its carbonation (compare the now-rare champagne coupe), and accordingly it is rarely found or used.\n\nChampagne stirrers originally developed centuries ago, when carbonation was seen as a defect, a result of an unintended secondary fermentation; they later fell out of vogue in the mid-18th century as sparkling champagne became desired. Champagne stirrers are today particularly associated with the ostentation of the Roaring 20s, and stirrers from this period especially may be admired or collected as antiques.\n\nChampagne stirrers operate by two mechanisms: agitation and nucleation. Stirring sparkling wine, or otherwise agitating it (such as by swirling) speeds the release of bubbles. Alternatively, a stirrer with high surface area and sharp corners provides many nucleation sites at which bubbles may form, and does not require stirring, hence the pointed and flayed design of many stirrers.\n"}

Re-exportation can be used to avoid sanctions by other nations. \n\nRe-exports consist of foreign goods exported in the same state as previously imported, from the free circulation area, premises for inward processing or industrial free zones, directly to the rest of the world and from premises for customs warehousing or commercial free zones, to the rest of the world.\n\nWhen dealing with trade data, it is essential to subtract re-exports from normal exports to arrive at the final value of exports. This is necessary because re-exports do not undergo any value-added processes, so cannot be counted towards a nation's exports.\n\nFor example, the United Arab Emirates may have engaged in re-exportation of goods to Iran as a way for Iran to avoid U.S. trade sanctions against it. Thus re-exportation involves export without further processing or transformation of a good that has been imported. In contrast, Finland imported crude oil from the Soviet Union as part of bilateral trade between these two countries and refined the oil for export to other Western European countries, while the Soviet Union did not intend to sell oil to these capitalist countries, but this was not re-exportation because the crude oil was refined before selling.\nDubai has emerged as the major re-export center for the entire Middle East region.\n\n"}

This final committee of amateurs makes the final prize determination because Grawemeyer insisted that great ideas are not exclusively the domain of academic experts.\n\nThe award has most often been awarded to large-scale works, such as symphonies, concerti, and operas. Only two Award-winning pieces (György Ligeti's \"Études\", for piano; and Sebastian Currier's \"Static\", for flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano) do not require a conductor in performance.\n\nOnly two years have seen no prize awarded. In 1988, the second panel, consisting of professional musicians (which that year included previous winner Harrison Birtwistle) determined that no work was deserving of the award. In 1999, the awarding of the prize was moved from the fall semester to the spring semester due to the University of Louisville's bicentennial celebrations, which meant that that year's winner (Thomas Adès) was given the prize in the spring of 2000 rather than the fall of 1999. The prize has been awarded in the spring each year since.\n\n"}

Saggers was born in King's Lynn in Norfolk.\n\nSaggers had little success in his three seasons with Durham between 1996 and 1998, but then joined Kent and from 2000 to 2003 took more than 50 first-class wickets each year, his best being 83 in 2002. He also played for Essex on loan in 2007. He played for his native Norfolk in minor county matches in 1995–6.\n\nIn 2012 Saggers became a full-time cricket umpire, standing in County Championship matches in England.\n\nSaggers made his Test match debut in 2003/04, as a replacement for the injured Andrew Flintoff in Dhaka, and also played in two of the three Tests against New Zealand the following summer. At Leeds he took the wicket of Mark Richardson with his first ball, but some wayward bowling and poor performances with the bat led to his being dropped for the games against West Indies. With the bat, he scored 1, 0 and 0 in three innings, finishing his Test career with a batting average of 0.33.\n\nSaggers suffered a knee in jury in August 2009, and a month later announced his retirement from professional cricket. Graham Johnson, Kent's chairman of cricket, paid tribute to Saggers, saying \"We owe Martin a great deal, especially during a period when he was our seam attack. Quite rightly, on the basis of this success, he received recognition at International level. Always enthusiastic and positive during his career, he will carry these qualities into his plans for what follows after cricket\".\n"}

It is sometimes called the \"Gateway to Provence\" because it is in a narrow gap between two long mountain ridges.\n\nIt is from Marseille, also from Grenoble, from Nice and from Forcalquier.\n\nThere are 1573 hectares of forest and wood within the commune.\n\nSisteron has been inhabited for 4000 years. The Romans used the route through Sisteron as can be shown by a Latin inscription in the rocks near the road to Authon. It escaped the barbarian invasions after the fall of Rome, but was ravaged by the Saracens. It was first fortified by the Counts of Forcalquier in the 11th century and later was the northern boundary of the domain of the Counts of Provence. In 1483 during the reign of Louis XI, Sisteron re-joined the kingdom of France. Around this time there were seven plagues that killed two thirds of the population. Between 1562 and 1594 the town and its citadelle was fought over by Protestants and Catholics including two sieges. During this time the walls of the town were built. The plague returned in 1630, and typhus in 1744, killing many of the town's population.\n\nDuring the French Revolution the town remained Royalist. Consequently, when Napoleon arrived on his march north after his escape from Elba in 1815, the town ignored him and let him through.\n\nOn 15 August 1944 French B-26 Marauder bombers and American B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 42nd Bomber Wing tried to destroy the railway bridge and the road bridge which span the Durance. The weather was unfavorable and the bridges were not destroyed. A bomber during a manoeuvre to avoid a collision accidentally dropped several bombs on the town, including a full church, causing about 100 fatalities and seriously damaging the citadel. On 17 August the French aircraft returned and destroyed the bridges.\n\nThe town's buildings include the citadel and the 12th century former Sisteron Cathedral dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Thyrsus (\"Cathédrale Notre Dame des Pommiers et Saint Thyrse\"). There are three museums of note: the Citadel Museum, the Baden-Powell Scout Museum and Musée Terre & Temps (about the earth and the measurement of time)\n\nTourist attractions include the countryside, the lido and the airfields at Vaumeilh, La Motte-du-Caire and Château-Arnoux-Saint-Auban, which are dedicated to the sport of gliding. There is an annual festival with many events throughout the summer months. There is a market every Wednesday. A long distance walk, the GR 6 (\"Grande Randonnée\") passes east–west through Sisteron.\n\nSisteron is served by the A51 autoroute, which now by-passes the town, eliminating it as a notorious 'bottle-neck' for traffic. There is also a railway station on the line from Marseille to Briançon and Grenoble.\n\n\nSisteron is twinned with:\n\nThe town was featured in the 2014 racing game Forza Horizon 2.\n\n\n"}

According to family traditions, the title \"Tarkhān\" was given to the family by Genghis Khan personally.\n\nGawhar Shad was married to Shah Rukh probably in 1388, certainly before 1394 when their son, Ulugh Beg was born. It was a successful marriage, according to the ballads of Herat which sing of Shah Rukh's love for her. But little is known of their first forty years together, except what concerns her buildings. \n\nAlong with her brothers who were administrators at the Timurid court in Herat, Gawhar Shad played a very important role in the early Timurid history. In 1405 she moved the Timurid capital from Samarkand to Herat.\n\nShe was instrumental in the construction of Herat's Mousallah Complex.\n\nUnder her patronage, the Persian language and Persian culture were elevated to a main element of the Timurid dynasty. She and her husband led a cultural renaissance by their lavish patronage of the arts, attracting to their court artists, architects and philosophers and poets acknowledged today among the world's most illustrious, including the poet Jami. Many exquisite examples of Timurid architecture remain in Herat today.\nAfter the death of her husband in 1447 Gawhar Shad maneuvered her favorite grandson to the throne. For ten years she became the de facto ruler of an empire stretching from the Tigris to the borders of China. When she was well past 80, she was executed on 19 July 1457 on the order of Sultān Abū Sa'īd.\n\nAccording to legend, Gawhar Shad once inspected a mosque and a religious school (madrasah) in Herat accompanied by two hundred female attendants, after it had been cleared of its students, all of whom were male. One youth remained, having fallen asleep in his cell, and was discovered by an attendant and seduced. When Gawhar Shad found out, she ordered that all two hundred of her attendants be married to the students.\n\nGawhar Shad's tomb is located next to the madrasah that she had built, of which the minaret remains until this day.\n\nA women's university in Kabul that opened in 2003 bears the name of Gawhar Shad \n\nGawhar Shad had a mosque (\"Masjid-e Goharshād\") built in 1418 in Mashad, Khorasan.

It is the first bank in both the Philippines and Southeast Asia. It is the fourth largest bank in terms of assets, the second largest bank in terms of market capitalization, and one of the most profitable banks in the Philippines.\n\nThe bank has a network of over 900 branches in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Europe, and more than 3,000 ATMs and CDMs (cash deposit machines). \n\nBPI was founded during the Spanish colonial era of the Philippines as El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II. It provided credit to the National Treasury and printed and issued the Philippine peso fuerte, a precursor to today's Philippine peso.\n\nBPI was established on August 1, 1851 as the \"El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II\" (), named after the queen of Spain, Isabella II, the daughter of King Ferdinand VII. It was the first government bank in the Philippines and the third Philippine bank during the Spanish era.\n\nThe royal decree establishing the Banco Español-Filipino also gave it the power to print Philippine currency, the first time the Philippine peso was printed in the country; before 1851, a multitude of currencies were used, most notably the Mexican peso. They were originally called Philippine peso fuerte (PF), or \"strong pesos\". First printed on May 1, 1852, they were redeemable at face value for gold or silver Mexican coins. The first deposit with the bank was also done on that day by a man named Fulgencio Barrera. Three days later, a Chinese man named Tadian became the first borrowing client of the bank after the bank discounted to him a promissory note amounting to ten thousand pesos fuertes.\n\nOn September 3, 1869, following a revolution which overthrew Isabella II, the name was changed to Banco Español-Filipino. In January 1892, the bank moved from the Royal Custom House in Intramuros to the new business district of Binondo after it found out that Intramuros was becoming \"economically inactive\". It moved to 4 Plaza Cervantes corner Juan Luna Street which was at that time a prime property owned by the Dominican friars.\n\nThe first branch of Banco Español-Filipino outside Manila was opened in Iloilo City on March 15, 1897. However, the idea to set up branches outside Manila was formulated as far back as the 1850s, with the first branch planned to be opened in Bacolor, the capital of Pampanga at the time. However, by then, Iloilo and other provinces in Panay had become more productive than Pampanga in the sugar industry, hence the move to open the first branch in Iloilo.\n\nFollowing the cession of the Philippines to the United States with the signing of the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the bank changed from a Spanish institution to a Philippine one. On January 1, 1912, a decision by the shareholders of Banco Español-Filipino changed the name to the present Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) or \"Banco de las Islas Filipinas\" in Spanish. The basis for the name change was Republic Act No. 1790, passed on October 12, 1907, which permitted the bank to change its name. The bank was also privatized during the American colonial period.\n\nFollowing World War II, BPI was actively involved in the post-war reconstruction of the Philippines. In 1949, with the establishment of the Central Bank of the Philippines (now the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), BPI lost the right to issue Philippine pesos, a right it had since the Spanish colonial era and during the American colonial period.\n\nIn December 31, 1969, Ayala Corporation, which had been affiliated with BPI since its establishment in 1851, became the dominant shareholder of BPI, and eventually made BPI into the flagship of Ayala's financial entities.\n\nStarting in the 1970s, BPI has been involved with many mergers and acquisitions. The first merger occurred in 1974 with BPI's acquisition of the People's Bank and Trust Company. Major notable acquisitions include Commercial Bank and Trust Company in 1981, CityTrust Banking Corporation in 1996 and Far East Bank and Trust Company in 2000.\n\nIn 1982, BPI became a universal bank, and in 2000, became the Philippines' first bank assurance firm, being the first Philippine bank to offer insurance services after acquiring the insurance companies of the Ayala Corporation, the parent company of the Ayala Corporation. Within that year, BPI also founded the BPI Direct Savings Bank, an Internet bank.\n\nOn February 14, 1986, BPI established its own interbank network, Expressnet. \n\nIn October 2015, BPI launched their \"Make the Best Things Happen\" campaign.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2019, BPI will start constructing its new headquarters in Makati. BPI has tapped Skidmore, Owings & Merrill for its design. The old building will be demolished to make space for the new building.\n\nOn the morning of June 7, 2017, a data processing glitch affected BPI clients making their account balances incorrect. Some clients had either a negative balance or an increased amount of money in their account. The error was fixed in the evening, but the next day, June 8, BPI suspended electronic services because incorrect balances occurred again. The services were restored once more on the evening of the same day upon fixing the defect.\n\n\"BPI Direct Savings Bank\" was a wholly owned subsidiary of BPI and was the first internet-based bank in the country, allowing expatriate Filipinos and overseas workers in countries like Bahrain or Hong Kong to access and manage their bank accounts at any time. \n\nBPI Direct Savings Bank was incorporated and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 26, 1986, primarily as a subsidiary meant to engage in the general business of savings and mortgage banking.\n\nIn 2000, BPI Direct underwent a major image change as it became the first Philippine bank designed around the telephone and online banking channels. It wanted to provide its clients with a way to have access to their accounts 24/7, as well as to provide the convenience of traditional banking services, such as opening a savings account. Two years later, BPI Direct realigned its business strategy towards the Overseas Filipino community, but without alienating its existing clientele.\n\nBPI Direct merged with BPI Globe BanKo, another thrift bank unit of BPI on December 2016 to form BPI Direct BanKO Inc. with a mission to promote financial inclusion by providing access to easy, convenient and affordable loan products to fund the operations or grow the businesses of self-employed microentrepreneurs (SEMEs).\n\nBPI is divided into the following subsidiaries and affiliates: \n\n\n\nWhile Philippine Central Depository is listed a major shareholder, it is more of a trustee-nominee for all shares lodged in the PCD system rather than a single owner/shareholder.\n\nOver the years, BPI and its subsidiaries have received the following awards from financial magazines and award-giving bodies:\n\n\n"}

The line between a PTA and a free trade area (FTA) may be blurred, as almost any PTA has a main goal of becoming a FTA in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n\nThese tariff preferences have created numerous departures from the normal trade relations principle, namely that World Trade Organization (WTO) members should apply the same tariff to imports from other WTO members.\n\nWith the recent multiplication of bilateral PTAs and the emergence of Mega-PTAs (wide regional trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) or Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)), a global trade system exclusively managed within the framework of the WTO now seems unrealistic and the interactions between trade systems have to be taken into account. The increased complexity of the international trade system generated by the multiplication of PTAs should be taken into account in the study of the choice of fora used by countries or regions to promote their trade relations and environmental agenda.\n\nA free trade area is basically a preferential trade area with increased depth and scope of tariffs reduction.

Promotional copies were sent out and three of the new songs were previewed in the band's 23rd Peel Session, recorded on 19 February and broadcast on 13 March 2003. Smith was unhappy with the mix and decided it needed further work, stating in November 2003:\n\n\"The frustration is when people embellish what you're doing. I thought this LP was perfect round about March. But then you trust people—them who shall remain nameless—to go away and mix it and it comes back sounding like Dr. Who meets Posh Spice.

However, the original title still appears on the CD spine.\n\nThe album features the song \"Theme from Sparta F.C.\", which, from 2005, was used for several years as the theme music to the Final Score section of BBC television's Saturday afternoon sports coverage. In 2006, Smith was also invited to read out the classified football results on the BBCi interactive service \"Score\"; this performance was in turn released by the Sonic Arts Network on their Stewart Lee-compiled album \"The Topography of Chance\".

Helen Pidd, reviewing the album for \"The Guardian\", viewed Smith as being \"on magnificently mad form\". Andres Lokko, for \"Expressen\", was also positive about the album, writing that Smith \"grinds and spits on everything that moves.

The film starred Rhonda Fleming, Raymond Burr, William Lundigan and Michael Ansara. In an early role, actress Julie Newmar (listed as Julie Newmeyer) appears as an exotic dancer clad only in gold paint (and a gold fabric bikini of early 1950s style).\n\nThe film opens in 44 BC, just after the assassination of Julius Caesar, and tells the story of the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra (Fleming) and her relationship with the Roman general Mark Anthony (Burr) from that time until their mutual suicide in 30 BC. It also stars William Lundigan as Lucilius and Michael Fox as Octavius. Lucilius, having previously accompanied Julius Caesar to Egypt and having been a close witness to Caesar's romance with Cleopatra, believes that Cleopatra is a woman highly skilled in besotting men to promote her own agenda, in this case to bind Mark Anthony to her desire to become queen of Rome and to make her son by Caesar the eventual ruler of the Roman Empire. In the meantime, as Lucilius becomes aware, Cleopatra is beguiling Anthony with continuous showings of feasting and luxury while the vast population of Egypt is suffering in hunger and poverty. When Lucilius reveals his concerns to Cleopatra, she makes an unsuccessful attempt to seduce him, in order to win him to her side. Cleopatra persuades Anthony that all this disaffection is the work of her younger half-sister, Arsinoe, and Lucilius is sent on an expedition against her in which she is (unhistorically) killed. Lucilius returns from this trip wounded by Cleopatra's own soldiers and even more distrustful of her, and is confined to his apartments as an honored prisoner, while Anthony continues to have his judgment clouded with constant feasting and drinking (and, although this is not mentioned, some sort of physical contact with Cleopatra's person). But Anthony dimly realizes that he has failed in his duties to Rome, most specifically in his role as a member of the ruling triumvirate, and that Cleopatra is scheming to use him to conquer Rome to make himself king and herself queen and Caesar's son the next absolute ruler of Rome, but he knows that Romans will never accept such a development; so he enables Lucilius to escape, with instructions to return to Rome and warn Octavius of what is happening in Egypt. (Unlike the Elizabeth Taylor version, this Cleopatra is not madly in love with Anthony, but is merely using him as a stepping stone). Soon enough Octavius brings Roman armies to Egypt to subdue this incipient mutiny. In this movie it would appear that a conscience-stricken Anthony stays in Cleopatra's palace, refusing to lead an Egyptian army against his beloved Rome. As Octavius closes in, Anthony stabs himself, Lucilius breaches the palace gates in time to bring a dying Anthony to Cleopatra's chamber, and Cleopatra, in despair of the complete frustration of her ambitions, uses a snake to kill herself. This brings the movie to its end before we see Cleopatra die.\n\nIn November 1951 Katzman announced he would make the movie based on \"Cleopatra\" by H. Rider Haggard. It was part of an eight-film slate he was making at Columbia, others including \"Prince of Pirates\" with Paul Henreid, \"Slaves ob Babylon\", \"Cairo to Suez\", \"Jack McCall, Desperado\", \"The Pathfinder\", \"Siren of Bagdad\" and \"Flame of Calcutta\".\n\nIn May 1952 Kaztman said the film would start in August. It was not made until 1953, when it was William Castle's first film at Columbia after a number of years at Universal. According to Castle, Katzman told the director this was Katzman's most ambitious film to date. Castle says the film was sold to the public as \"2 years in the making\" when Kazman had in reality only been talking about making it for two years. Castle said the correct ad copy should have been \"2 Years in The Talking. Fifteen days in the making.\" By July Rhonda Fleming and William Lundigan were attached to star.\n\nThe title was apparently adapted from Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\", Act I, scene 5.\n\nThe film had a very low budget. It was shot on the sets left over from Rita Hayworth's \"Salome\". One sequence depicts a chariot racing through the sands of Egypt towards a sand dune in the distance, behind which looms a pyramid. It is extremely obvious that this composition (like many others) is a matte shot: the pyramid in the background is a superimposed painting, with the sand dune concealing the join between the live action and the matte. Elsewhere in the film, Rhonda Fleming as Cleopatra is clearly wearing a \"bullet bra\" of the style that was fashionable in the 1950s, and the Egyptian dancing girls are wearing bikinis of the same era.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2061965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061965", "title": "Economic integration", "text": "Economic integration\n\nEconomic integration is the unification of economic policies between different states, through the partial or full abolition of tariff and non-tariff restrictions on trade. \n\nThe trade-stimulation effects intended by means of economic integration are part of the contemporary economic Theory of the Second Best: where, in theory, the best option is free trade, with free competition and no trade barriers whatsoever. Free trade is treated as an idealistic option, and although realized within certain developed states, economic integration has been thought of as the \"second best\" option for global trade where barriers to full free trade exist.\n\nEconomic integration is meant in turn to lead to lower prices for distributors and consumers with the goal of increasing the level of welfare, while leading to an increase of economic productivity of the states.\n\nThere are economic as well as political reasons why nations pursue economic integration. The economic rationale for the increase of trade between member states of economic unions rests on the supposed productivity gains from integration. This is one of the reasons for the development of economic integration on a global scale, a phenomenon now realized in continental economic blocs such as ASEAN, NAFTA, SACN, the European Union, AfCFTA and the Eurasian Economic Community; and proposed for intercontinental economic blocks, such as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia and the Transatlantic Free Trade Area.\n\nComparative advantage refers to the ability of a person or a country to produce a particular good or service at a lower marginal and opportunity cost over another. Comparative advantage was first described by David Ricardo who explained it in his 1817 book \"On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\" in an example involving England and Portugal. In Portugal it is possible to produce both wine and cloth with less labour than it would take to produce the same quantities in England. However the relative costs of producing those two goods are different in the two countries. In England it is very hard to produce wine, and only moderately difficult to produce cloth. In Portugal both are easy to produce. Therefore, while it is cheaper to produce cloth in Portugal than England, it is cheaper still for Portugal to produce excess wine, and trade that for English cloth. Conversely England benefits from this trade because its cost for producing cloth has not changed but it can now get wine at a lower price, closer to the cost of cloth. The conclusion drawn is that each country can gain by specializing in the good where it has comparative advantage, and trading that good for the other.\n\nEconomies of scale refers to the cost advantages that an enterprise obtains due to expansion. There are factors that cause a producer's average cost per unit to fall as the scale of output is increased. Economies of scale is a long run concept and refers to reductions in unit cost as the size of a facility and the usage levels of other inputs increase. Economies of scale is also a justification for economic integration, since some economies of scale may require a larger market than is possible within a particular country — for example, it would not be efficient for Liechtenstein to have its own car maker, if they would only sell to their local market. A lone car maker may be profitable, however, if they export cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market.\n\nBesides these economic reasons, the primary reasons why economic integration has been pursued in practise are largely political. The \"Zollverein\" or German Customs Union of 1867 paved the way for partial German unification under Prussian leadership in 1871. \"Imperial free trade\" was (unsuccessfully) proposed in the late 19th century to strengthen the loosening ties within the British Empire. The European Economic Community was created to integrate France and Germany's economies to the point that they would find it impossible to go to war with each other.\n\nAmong the requirements for successful development of economic integration are \"permanency\" in its evolution (a gradual expansion and over time a higher degree of economic/political unification); \"a formula for sharing joint revenues\" (customs duties, licensing etc.) between member states (e.g., per capita); \"a process for adopting decisions\" both economically and politically; and \"a will to make concessions\" between developed and developing states of the union.\n\nA \"coherence\" policy is a must for the permanent development of economic unions, being also a property of the economic integration process. Historically the success of the European Coal and Steel Community opened a way for the formation of the European Economic Community (EEC) which involved much more than just the two sectors in the ECSC. So a coherence policy was implemented to use a different speed of economic unification (coherence) applied both to economic sectors and economic policies. Implementation of the coherence principle in adjusting economic policies in the member states of economic block causes economic integration effects.\n\nThe framework of the theory of economic integration was laid out by Jacob Viner (1950) who defined the trade creation and trade diversion effects, the terms introduced for the change of interregional flow of goods caused by changes in customs tariffs due to the creation of an economic union. He considered trade flows between two states prior and after their unification, and compared them with the rest of the world. His findings became and still are the foundation of the theory of economic integration. The next attempts to enlarge the static analysis towards three states+world (Lipsey, et al.) were not as successful.\n\nThe basics of the theory were summarized by the Hungarian economist Béla Balassa in the 1960s. As economic integration increases, the barriers of trade between markets diminish. Balassa believed that supranational common markets, with their free movement of economic factors across national borders, naturally generate demand for further integration, not only economically (via monetary unions) but also politically—and, thus, that economic communities naturally evolve into political unions over time.\n\nThe dynamic part of international economic integration theory, such as the dynamics of trade creation and trade diversion effects, the Pareto efficiency of factors (labor, capital) and value added, mathematically was introduced by Ravshanbek Dalimov. This provided an interdisciplinary approach to the previously static theory of international economic integration, showing what effects take place due to economic integration, as well as enabling the results of the non-linear sciences to be applied to the dynamics of international economic integration.\n\nEquations describing:\n\n\nwere successfully applied towards:\n\n\nThe straightforward conclusion from the findings is that one may use the accumulated knowledge of the exact and natural sciences (physics, biodynamics, and chemical kinetics) and apply them towards the analysis and forecasting of economic dynamics.\n\nDynamic analysis has started with a new definition of gross domestic product (GDP), as a difference between aggregate revenues of sectors and investment (a modification of the value added definition of the GDP). It was possible to analytically prove that all the states gain from economic unification, with larger states receiving less growth of GDP and productivity, and vice versa concerning the benefit to lesser states. Although this fact has been empirically known for decades, now it was also shown as being mathematically correct.\n\nA qualitative finding of the dynamic method is the similarity of a coherence policy of economic integration and a mixture of previously separate liquids in a retort: they finally get one colour and become one liquid. Economic space (tax, insurance and financial policies, customs tariffs, etc.) all finally become the same along with the stages of economic integration.\n\nAnother important finding is a direct link between the dynamics of macro- and micro-economic parameters such as the evolution of industrial clusters and the GDP's temporal and spatial dynamics. Specifically, the dynamic approach analytically described the main features of the theory of competition summarized by Michael Porter, stating that industrial clusters evolve from initial entities gradually expanding within their geographic proximity. It was analytically found that the geographic expansion of industrial clusters goes along with raising their productivity and technological innovation.\n\nDomestic savings rates of the member states were observed to strive to one magnitude, and the dynamic method of forecasting this phenomenon has also been developed. Overall dynamic picture of economic integration has been found to look quite similar to unification of previously separate basins after opening intraboundary sluices, where instead of water the value added (revenues) of entities of member states interact.\n\nThe degree of economic integration can be categorized into seven stages:\n\n\nThese differ in the degree of unification of economic policies, with the highest one being the completed economic integration of the states, which would most likely involve political integration as well.\n\nA \"free trade area\" (FTA) is formed when at least two states partially or fully abolish custom tariffs on their inner border. To exclude regional exploitation of zero tariffs within the FTA there is a rule of certificate of origin for the goods originating from the territory of a member state of an FTA.\n\nA \"customs union\" introduces unified tariffs on the exterior borders of the union (CET, common external tariffs). A \"monetary union\" introduces a shared currency. A \"common market\" add to a FTA the free movement of services, capital and labor.\n\nAn \"economic union\" combines customs union with a common market. A \"fiscal union\" introduces a shared fiscal and budgetary policy. In order to be successful the more advanced integration steps are typically accompanied by unification of economic policies (tax, social welfare benefits, etc.), reductions in the rest of the trade barriers, introduction of supranational bodies, and gradual moves towards the final stage, a \"political union\".\n\nGlobalization refers to the increasing global relationships of culture, people, and economic activity.\n\nWith economics crisis started in 2008 the global economy has started to realize quite a few initiatives on regional level.\nIt is unification between the EU and US, expansion of Eurasian Economic Community (now Eurasia Economic Union) by Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. It is also the creation of BRICS with the bank of its members, and notably high motivation of creating competitive economic structures within Shanghai Organization, also creating the bank with many multi-currency instruments applied. Engine for such fast and dramatic changes was insufficiency of global capital, while one has to mention obvious large political discrepancies witnessed in 2014–2015. Global economy has to overcome this by easing the moves of capital and labor, while this is impossible unless the states will find common point of views in resolving cultural and politic differences which pushed it so far as of now.\n\nIn economics the word \"integration\" was first employed in industrial organisation to refer to combinations of business firms through economic agreements, cartels, concerns, trusts, and mergers—horizontal integration referring to combinations of competitors, vertical integration to combinations of suppliers with customers. In the current sense of combining separate economies into larger economic regions, the use of the word \"integration\" can be traced to the 1930s and 1940s. Fritz Machlup credits Eli Heckscher, Herbert Gaedicke and Gert von Eyern as the first users of the term \"economic integration\" in its current sense. According to Machlup, such usage first appears in the 1935 English translation of Hecksher's 1931 book \"Merkantilismen\" (\"Mercantilism\" in English), and independently in Gaedicke's and von Eyern's 1933 two-volume study \"Die produktionswirtschaftliche Integration Europas: Eine Untersuchung über die Aussenhandelsverflechtung der europäischen Länder\".\n\n\n"}

The name comes from the similarity in shape to a straw beehive.\n\nThe ancient Bantu used this type of house, which was made with mud, poles, and cow dung. Early European settlers in the Karoo region of South Africa built similar structures known as corbelled houses. These white-washed structures are described as coursed rubble on a circular plan, with each successive course smaller and slightly corbelled over the course below so that a conical shape is achieved as each course is completed.\n\nBeehive houses are some of the oldest known structures in Ireland and Scotland, dating from as far back as around 2000 BC and some were still being built as late as the 19th century in Apulia (south-eastern Italy). In Southern Italy, these houses are called \"trulli\" while its prehistoric Sardinian versions were referred to as \"nuraghi\".\n\nA town called Harran in Turkey is also the location of houses that mimic the beehive architecture and they are still in existence today.

{"id": "2061975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061975", "title": "Stomatitis", "text": "Stomatitis\n\nStomatitis is inflammation of the mouth and lips. It refers to any inflammatory process affecting the mucous membranes of the mouth and lips, with or without oral ulceration.\n\nIn its widest meaning, stomatitis can have a multitude of different causes and appearances. Common causes include infections, nutritional deficiencies, allergic reactions, radiotherapy, and many others.\n\nWhen inflammation of the gums and the mouth generally presents itself, sometimes the term \"gingivostomatitis\" is used, though this is also sometimes used as a synonym for herpetic gingivostomatitis.\n\nThe term is derived from the Greek \"stoma\" (), meaning \"mouth\", and the suffix \"-itis\" (), meaning \"inflammation\".\n\nMalnutrition (improper dietary intake) or malabsorption (poor absorption of nutrients into the body) can lead to nutritional deficiency states, several of which can lead to stomatitis. For example, deficiencies of iron, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B9 (folic acid) or vitamin B12 (cobalamine) may all manifest as stomatitis. Iron is necessary for the upregulation of transcriptional elements for cell replication and repair. Lack of iron can cause genetic downregulation of these elements, leading to ineffective repair and regeneration of epithelial cells, especially in the mouth and lips. Many disorders which cause malabsorption can cause deficiencies, which in turn causes stomatitis. Examples include tropical sprue.\n\nAphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is the recurrent appearance of mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals. The cause is not completely understood, but it is thought that the condition represents a T cell mediated immune response which is triggered by a variety of factors. The individual ulcers (aphthae) recur periodically and heal completely, although in the more severe forms new ulcers may appear in other parts of the mouth before the old ones have finished healing. Aphthous stomatitis is one of the most common diseases of the oral mucosa, and is thought to affect about 20% of the general population to some degree. The symptoms range from a minor nuisance to being disabling in their impact on eating, swallowing and talking, and the severe forms can cause people to lose weight. There is no cure for aphthous stomatitis, and therapies are aimed at alleviating the pain, reducing the inflammation and promoting healing of the ulcers, but there is little evidence of efficacy for any treatment that has been used.\n\nInflammation of the corners (angles) of the lips is termed angular stomatitis or angular cheilitis. In children a frequent cause is repeated lip-licking, and in adults it may be a sign of underlying iron deficiency anemia, or vitamin B deficiencies (\"e.g.\", B-riboflavin, B-folate, or B-cobalamin, which in turn may be evidence of poor diets or malnutrition such as celiac disease).\n\nAlso, angular cheilitis can be caused by a patient's jaws at rest being 'overclosed' due to edentulousness or tooth wear, causing the jaws to come to rest closer together than if the complete/unaffected dentition were present. This causes skin folds around the angle of the mouth which are kept moist by saliva, which in turn favours infection; mostly by \"Candida albicans\" or similar species. Treatment usually involves the administration of topical nystatin or similar antifungal agents. Another treatment can be to correct the jaw relationship with dental treatment (\"e.g.\", dentures or occlusal adjustment).\n\nThis is a common condition present in denture wearers. It appears as reddened but painless mucosa beneath the denture. 90% of cases are associated with \"Candida\" species, and it is the most common form of oral candidiasis. Treatment is by antifungal medication and improved dental hygiene, such as not wearing the denture during sleep.\n\nAllergic contact stomatitis (also termed \"allergic gingivostomatitis\" or \"allergic contact gingivostomatitis\") is a type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in susceptible atopic individuals when allergens penetrate the skin or mucosa.\n\nAllergens, which may be different for different individuals, combine with epithelial-derived proteins, forming haptens which bind with Langerhans cells in the mucosa, which in turn present the antigen on their surface to T lymphocytes, sensitizing them to that antigen and causing them to produce many specific clones. The second time that specific antigen is encountered, an inflammatory reaction is triggered at the site of exposure. Allergic contact stomatitis is less common than allergic contact dermatitis because the mouth is coated in saliva, which washes away antigens and acts as a barrier. The oral mucosa is also more vascular (has a better blood supply) than skin, meaning that any antigens are more quickly removed from the area by the circulation. Finally, there is substantially less keratin in oral mucosa, meaning that there is less likelihood that haptens will form.\n\nAllergic contact stomatitis appears as non-specific inflammation, so it may be mistaken for chronic physical irritation. There may be burning or soreness of the mouth and ulceration. Chronic exposure to the allergen may result in a lichenoid lesion. Plasma cell gingivitis may also occur, which may be accompanied by glossitis and cheilitis.\nAllergens that may cause allergic contact stomatitis in some individuals include cinnamaldehyde, Balsam of Peru, peppermint, mercury, gold, pyrophosphates, zinc citrate, free acrylic monomer, nickel, fluoride, and sodium lauryl sulfate. These allergens may originate from many sources, including various foods and drink, chewing gum, toothpaste, mouthwash, dental floss, dental fillings, dentures, orthodontic bands or wires, and many other sources. If the substance containing the allergen comes into contact with the lips, allergic contact cheilitis can occur, together with allergic contact stomatitis.\n\nThe diagnosis is confirmed by patch test, and management is by avoidance of exposure to the allergen.\n\nMigratory stomatitis (or geographic stomatitis) is an atypical presentation of a condition which normally presents on the tongue, termed geographic tongue. Geographic tongue is so named because there are atrophic, erythematous areas of depapillation that migrate over time, giving a map-like appearance.\n\nIn migratory stomatitis, other mucosal sites in the mouth, such as the ventral surface (undersurface) of the tongue, buccal mucosa, labial mucosa, soft palate, or floor of mouth may be afflicted with identical lesions, usually in addition to the tongue. Apart from not being restricted to the tongue, migratory stomatitis is an identical condition in every regard to geographic tongue. Another synonym for geographic tongue which uses the term stomatitis is \"stomatitis areata migrans\".\n\nThis is inflammation of the mouth caused by herpes simplex virus.\n\nStomatitis may also be caused by chemotherapy, or radiation therapy of the oropharyngeal area. The term \"mucositis\" is sometimes used synonymously with stomatitis, however the former usually refers to mucosal reactions to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, and may occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and not just in the mouth.\n\nThe term \"necrotizing ulcerative gingivostomatitis\" is sometimes used as a synonym of the necrotizing periodontal disease more commonly termed necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, or a more severe form (also termed necrotizing stomatitis). The term \"necrotizing gingivostomatitis\" is also sometimes used.\n\nAlso called smoker's palatal keratosis, this condition may occur in smokers, especially pipe smokers. The palate appears dry and cracked, and white from keratosis. The minor salivary glands appear as small, red and swollen bumps. It is not a premalignant condition, and the appearance reverses if the smoking is stopped.\n\nChronic ulcerative stomatitis is a recently discovered condition with specific immunopathologic features. It is characterized by erosions and ulcerations which relapse and remit. Lesions are located on the buccal mucosa (inside of the cheeks) or on the gingiva (gums). The condition resembles Oral lichen planus when biopsied.\n\nThe diagnosis is made with Immunofluorescence techniques, which shows circulating and tissue-bound autoantibodies (particulate stratified squamous-epithelium-specific antinuclear antibody) to DeltaNp63alpha protein, a normal component of the epithelium. Treatment is with hydroxychloroquine.\n\nTerms such as \"plasma cell gingivostomatitis\", \"atypical gingivostomatitis\" and \"idiopathic gingivostomatitis\" are sometimes a synonym for plasma cell gingivitis, or specifically to refer to a severe form of plasma cell gingivitis.\n\n"}

Pus is usually present, along with gradual thickening and browning discoloration of the nail plate.\nAcute paronychia is usually caused by bacteria. Paronychia is often treated with antibiotics, either topical or oral or both. Chronic paronychia is most often caused by a yeast infection of the soft tissues around the nail but can also be traced to a bacterial infection.

A simple treatment with over-the-counter topical antibiotics such as mupirocin [Bactroban], gentamicin, bacitracin/neomycin/polymyxin B [Neosporin] may suffice for mild cases. Antibiotics such as clindamycin or cephalexin are also often used, the first being more effective in areas where MRSA is common. If there are signs of an abscess (the presence of pus) drainage is recommended.\n\nChronic paronychia is treated by avoiding whatever is causing it, a topical antifungal, and a topical steroid. In those who do not improve following these measures, oral antifungals and steroids may be used or the nail fold may be removed surgically.\n\n"}

As a dancer, he performed with the Australian Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre. He was later Artistic Director of the Australian Ballet (1997–2001) and the Royal Ballet (2001–2002).\n\nRoss Stretton was born in Canberra in 1952. He started his dancing career as a tap dancer, winning the Australian national tap-dancing championships twice and winning numerous other awards. At the age of 11, he won a Channel Seven Junior Talent Quest, with a judge comparing him to Fred Astaire. In his pre-teenage years, he studied dance with Katrina Druzins, in a small studio at her home in Yarralumla – when dance for young males, particularly in Canberra in the 'sixties, was regarded with curiosity, even suspicion. Druzins, who was a postwar Eastern European emigree to Australia, and who specialised in teaching ballet with a fine degree of discipline, eased Stretton into that form of dance. Stretton, who sacrificed his scholastic studies for his art, did not, however, start studying and performing ballet exclusively until he was 17, when he began taking classes with Bryan Lawrence and Janet Karin, former principals of the Australian Ballet.\n\nHe successfully auditioned for a position at the Australian Ballet School in 1971. In his first year, he won the Nureyev bursary and received a Harold Holt Memorial Scholarship in his second year. He graduated from the Ballet School in 1972 with honours in all of his practical and danced the leading male role as the prince in the School's production of \"Cinderella\".\n\nStretton joined the Australian Ballet in 1973 and became a soloist the following year. After winning a Robert Helpmann Scholarship in 1975, he undertook a study trip to the US. During his time at the Australian Ballet, he danced all the classical roles in the company's schedule. In the 1977 production of \"Swan Lake\", he developed a strong partnership with Michaela Kirkaldie although he had to be taken to hospital after miscalculating the spectacular leap into the lake in a performance at the Canberra Theatre and missing the mattress behind the scenes meant to break his fall. In 1978, he became a principal dancer with the Australian ballet.\n\nIn 1979, he decided to leave Australia for the US to establish an international reputation. Stretton initially joined the Joffrey Theatre before a brief stint at the Northern Ballet Theatre in Manchester. He debuted with the American Ballet Theatre (ABT) in 1980–81. In the following season, he became a soloist with the ABT and a principal the following season. He also worked with Mikhail Baryshnikov in Baryshnikov and Co as part of a select group of ABT dancers.\n\nDuring his dancing career, Stretton developed a reputation as a great classical dancer although the \"New York Times\" stated in a news report on his death that \"acting was not his forte\". He retired as a dancer in 1990.\n\nStretton started his new career as a regisseur with the ABT combining administrative duties along with responsibilities for casting, teaching and coaching. In 1993, he was promoted to an assistant director position.\n\nHe returned to the Australian Ballet in 1997 as successor to Maina Gielgud. Stretton brought new works into the company's repertoire from a range of choreographers including Twyla Tharp. He also commissioned collaborations with the Australian Chamber Orchestra and the Bangarra Dance Theatre. \"Rites\", choreographed by Stephen Page in 1997, featured dancers from the indigenous Bangarra company along with dancers from the Australian ballet.\n\nIn 1999, Stretton took the Australian Ballet on a US tour featuring Australian dance works not previously seen in North America. \"The New York Times\" described it as a \"company reborn\" based on that tour. On Stretton's death, David McAllister, his successor as artistic director, stated Stretton \"brought the company bounding into the 21st century.\"\n\nDuring his tenure at the Australian Ballet, his catchphrase was \"creativity, energy and passion\". He had the reputation of being a demanding artistic director and was known for having a short temper which meant that he often did not have good relations with his dancers.\n\nStretton's success with the Australian Ballet led to an offer to take over as artistic director at the Royal Ballet with the intention of bringing new works to the company. His first and only season at the Royal Ballet was criticised with the \"Daily Telegraph's\" ballet critic describing it as feeble. In particular, the productions of \"Don Quixote\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\" were strongly criticised, as was his staging of a Gala for the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Productions of \"Carmen\", choreographed by Mats Ek, John Cranko's \"Onegin\", and \"Tryst\", a new work by Christopher Wheeldon, received more favourable reviews.\n\nFollowing Sir Anthony Dowell's retirement as Artistic Director of the Royal Ballet in 2001, the board of the Royal Opera House announced Stretton as his successor, with a three-year contract, however he resigned the post after 13 months, in September 2002. Stretton's appointment and departure from the Royal Ballet generated the most unprecedented level of media attention for the Royal Ballet in recent years, due to controversy caused by his time at the company.\n\nIn the weeks preceding his resignation dancers from the company had threatened to go on strike in protest at Stretton's management style, objecting to Stretton's casting decisions, and to the fact that Stretton frequently made changes to advertised casts. At the time of Stretton's resignation sources at the Royal Opera House, the parent company of the Royal Ballet, suggested that Stretton's failure to develop satisfactory working relations with senior management contributed to his departure. Stretton's own statement hinted at artistic differences:\n\n\"Even though I have enormous respect for the great heritage of this company, my interest lies primarily in developing the future of ballet, and that is what I want to spend my time doing.\"\n\nFollowing Stretton's departure Dame Monica Mason, assistant director and a former principal dancer with the company, took his position, at first on an interim basis. Mason was appointed Director of the Royal Ballet in December 2002.\n\nIt is claimed that a number of issues and allegations led to Stretton's departure from the Royal Ballet:\n\n\n\"The New York Times\" commented on the artistic and administrative approach of Stretton,\n\n\"In his focus on creativity and new choreographers to balance the existing repertory, Mr. Stretton was essentially implementing the policies he had observed at Ballet Theater. He had attempted to do the same as director of the Australian Ballet from 1997 to 2001. There again, he had run into opposition from some dancers and exponents of the status quo.\" \n\nStretton returned to Melbourne where he worked as a specialist consultant in dance.\n\nHe was diagnosed with a melanoma and died of complications in June 2005, aged 53. He was survived by his former wife Valmai Roberts and his three children.\n\nAt the 2005 Australian Dance Awards he was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2061988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061988", "title": "James Anderton", "text": "James Anderton\n\nSir Cyril James Anderton (born 24 May 1932) is a retired British police officer who served as chief constable of Greater Manchester from 1976 to 1991.\n\nBorn and brought up in a coalmining family in Wigan, Lancashire, he was educated at St Matthew's Church School and later at Wigan Grammar School. Anderton performed three years' National Service in the Royal Military Police before joining the Manchester City Police force in 1953. He began his career as a beat constable in the Moss Side area of Manchester before being talent-spotted by then Superintendent Robert Mark who later became Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Anderton rose rapidly through the ranks of the Manchester City Police, studying criminology at the Victoria University of Manchester. He became a chief superintendent of Cheshire Constabulary and later the assistant chief constable of Leicestershire Constabulary. In 1975 he became deputy chief constable of the Greater Manchester Police (GMP), which had been founded a year earlier. On 23 October 1976, he was appointed chief constable, at age 46.\n\nOne of Anderton's first acts as chief constable was a drive against pornography and prostitution. A special squad raided 284 bookshops, newsagents and warehouses, confiscating a total of 160,000 magazines to a street value of £200,000. Seizures included \"The Sun Page Three Annual\". The crackdown received support from some feminists and anti-pornography campaigners, but was criticised by civil liberties groups as a moral crusade. Anderton replied to his critics by stating that he was responding to public complaints regarding the graphic nature of the material available in shops across Greater Manchester. It has also been argued that organised crime gangs in Manchester controlled the sale and distribution of pornographic material as well as running brothels, massage parlours and street prostitution.\n\nThere was also a drive against late night drinking in the city centre of Manchester with particular focus against illegal drinking clubs and after hours drinking in licensed bars and clubs. As a result, 24 nightclubs had their licences revoked by magistrates. This tight police control led to a significant increase in levels of drink-related crime and disorder in Manchester city centre.\n\nRegular patrols were also conducted into the Canal Street area of central Manchester, the centre of Manchester's gay community. Anderton was frequently criticised by gay rights activists of devoting undue attention to the policing of the area due to his alleged prejudice towards the gay community. According to \"The Guardian\", Anderton \"encouraged his officers to stalk its dank alleys and expose anyone caught in a clinch, while police motorboats with spotlights searched for gay men around the canal's locks and bridges\". Anderton responded to criticism by stating that he was merely enforcing the law regarding sexual activity in public toilets and that there had been a significant number of complaints from local people regarding police inaction.\n\nIn 1977 Greater Manchester Police was the first English police force to deploy a plainclothes \"decoy\" squad to lure street robbers or \"muggers\" into the open. Anderton adopted the tactic from the New York City Police Department.\n\nAlso in 1977 Anderton ordered the creation of the Tactical Aid Group. Modelled on the Metropolitan Police's Special Patrol Group, the Tactical Aid Group (TAG) was responsible for providing Greater Manchester Police with a mobile reserve for combating public disorder and crime. The Tactical Aid Group was regularly deployed to combat football violence and disorder during demonstrations and industrial disputes. Greater Manchester Police became the leading English police force outside the Metropolitan Police for the development of public order tactics and use of firearms.\n\nBetween 1977 and 1979, Anderton received national media attention by successfully ensuring a series of marches by the far-right National Front passed without serious incident garnering a reputation as a tough, hands-on chief constable.\n\nDuring the summer of 1977, marches in Ladywood and Lewisham had been marred by riots. After initially banning a march proposed for October 1977, he met secretly with the National Front's deputy leader, Martin Webster, and agreed to allow a march to take place if the location was kept secret. To control opposing demonstrators, GMP was placed on standby, reinforcements drafted in from neighbouring forces and helicopters deployed. The cost for this operation – the most sophisticated public order operation in Britain up to that date – amounted to £250,000. Another two massive policing operations allowed Front meetings to take place in Hyde and Bolton town halls in January and February 1978.\n\nIn December 1981 Anderton formed the first specialist unit within GMP based in Moss Side to investigate racially motivated violence and other crimes. This was followed later by other police forces across England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nIn July 1981, Anderton had to deal with the Moss Side riot. That year a series of riots in Bristol, Brixton and Toxteth had hit England, with GMP officers having been deployed as reinforcements to Liverpool. To avoid the high police casualties seen in the Toxteth riots, Anderton decided not to deploy static cordons of officers with long protective shields, judging that such defensive tactics would only encourage prolonged confrontations. He instead ordered the Greater Manchester Police to be supplied with protective crash helmets – at the time the only English police force with such equipment. Anderton also ordered the creation of a Force Contingency Plan to be activated in the event of rioting breaking out in the Greater Manchester area.\n\nWhen riots broke out at Moss Side in July, GMP at first kept a low profile, while community leaders tried to defuse the situation and disperse the crowds. However, after two days of street disorder and looting, Anderton ordered a swift and hard intervention, sending in the Tactical Aid Group (TAG) to clear the streets using a vehicle based rapid dispersal strategy developed in Northern Ireland by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The specially trained TAG officers using snatch squads deployed from fast moving vans made 150 arrests in the space of two hours and quelled the disorder. Interviewed in 1992, Anderton described his strategy during the Moss Side riots: \nWhen trouble arises and violence occurs on the street, you hit it fast and hard. And that's what we did the following night. We hit the rioters fast and hard with all the force at our disposal-legitimate and lawful force-and we crushed the riots in Manchester in 24 hours.\n\nGreater Manchester Police's rapid and flexible mobile response was unique in British public order policing at that time and received much praise from the media, politicians and the general public. The leadership of Anderton was contrasted favourably with the perceived police loss of control in other venues. William Whitelaw, the Home Secretary, described the dispersal operation as a \"conspicuous success\".\n\nDuring his tenure as chief constable of Greater Manchester, Anderton repeatedly clashed with the Greater Manchester Police Committee and later the Police Authority, especially with its Labour Party members. Anderton openly regarded them as part of an extensive left-wing conspiracy to overthrow British democracy. He consistently argued that for such a conspiracy to succeed, the police had to be weakened and made subordinate to politicians.\n\nCentral to the policing philosophy of Anderton was the fear of political influence interfering with police duty especially during protests, demonstrations and industrial disputes, issues which dominated British policing during the period he was chief constable, fearing that such interference would weaken and undermine the police. Only a strong police force headed by chief constables free from political control, he argued, could maintain democracy and public order.\n\nFollowing this particular speech, Anderton was called in front of the Greater Manchester Police Committee, where he was told to lower his public profile and to allow himself to be directed by its members regarding police operations. Anderton refused, comparing his questioning with the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nHis gave speeches in the context of attempts by Police Committees in Liverpool and in Manchester to increase their influence over operational decision making by chief constables. Policing following the 1981 riots and the Miners' Strike had become a highly emotive and contentious issue.\n\nAnderton was particularly criticised by members of his Police Committee for his attitude toward armed police. In 1983 he announced mobile armed patrols to counter an increase in armed robberies in Greater Manchester. These patrols later became known as Armed Response Vehicles and are now routinely used by police forces across the United Kingdom. In 1986 Anderton issued 9mm MP5 carbines to selected officers based at Manchester Airport on security patrols. Following the riots in Brixton, Tottenham and Handsworth in 1985 Anderton announced that the Greater Manchester Police would be equipped with Plastic Baton Rounds. Anderton justified his decision with police casualties suffered during these riots:\n\n\"We have two choices in the police force-either we stay where we are and die or we ignominiously cut and run. As long as it is in my power, I have no intention of leaving my officers unprotected...I shall never abandon the citizens of Greater Manchester to the mercy of rioters, rapists, looters and criminals.\"\n\nIn 1986, Anderton was embroiled in national political controversy when his deputy John Stalker was suspended over allegations of his friendship with a man called Kevin Taylor, who was accused of fraud and drug-dealing through an alleged association with the Quality Street Gang when on the point of completing an official report, the Stalker Inquiry, critical of the policing policies of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.\n\nAnderton praised his officers, and warned the British public during the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union of the threat of left-wing subversion, stating in an October 1979 edition of the BBC's \"Question Time\" programme that he believed in the 1980s the primary role of the police would not be crime prevention but quelling attempts to overthrow democracy and subvert the authority of the State.\n\nWhen challenged by left wing Labour councillors and community activists on what they believed was his heavy-handed approach as chief constable, Anderton directly confronted his opponents and accused them of subversion, undermining police morale and threatening British democracy. He also denounced some defence lawyers as belonging to a \"Society for the Prevention of the Conviction of the Guilty\", attacked the \"Race Relations Industry\" for creating tension between ethnic minority groups and the wider population and detected a threat by left-wing extremists operating in the trade union movement and in society in general. He called for the introduction of National ID cards, and the creation of a national police force – thereby abolishing local police authorities – especially in the case of monitoring British football hooliganism.\n\nAnderton's outspoken views sparked public controversy throughout his period as chief constable of Greater Manchester. He frequently criticised what he saw as the \"soft\" sentencing of criminals and the moral decline of society.\n\nThe media often depicted Anderton as the polar opposite of John Alderson, chief constable of Devon and Cornwall. While Alderson was portrayed as a liberal and progressive thinker who favoured community or \"soft\" policing, Anderton was often depicted as a tough, uncompromising and bombastic figure who endorsed a philosophy of \"hard\" paramilitary policing against crime and public disorder. Anderton disagreed with this juxtaposition, stressing that his policing in Greater Manchester was community-based and argued that the effective protection of the community required the deployment of both \"hard\" and \"soft\" police tactics.\n\nAlthough Anderton frequently criticised church leaders for failing to provide a moral lead, he was vocal about his own Christian faith – he was a Methodist lay preacher before converting to Catholicism due to the Catholic Church's stance on moral issues. It has been claimed that Anderton said he had \"a direct line to God\", and Anderton became known as \"God's Copper\" due to his views. He saw the police as a means of providing moral enforcement against \"social nonconformists, malingerers, idlers, parasites, spongers, frauds, cheats and unrepentant criminals\", and was a vocal opponent of gay rights, feminism, pornography and those who \"openly hanker[ed] after total debauchery and lewdness\". He attracted controversy due to a 1987 BBC Radio 4 interview, where he claimed to be used by God to speak out on moral issues. This led to calls for his resignation from a police monitoring committee based in Manchester, as well as Liberal and Labour MPs.\n\nIn March 1984 during the Miners' Strike, Anderton said of the strict curfews and patrolling of the pit villages,\n\n\"It appears that the police have imposed a curfew on the community as a whole, not just on the miners, and also that they have restricted free movement. These are things we normally associate with countries behind the iron curtain. The police are getting the image of a heavy-handed mob.\"\n\nAnderton was the only chief constable to question publicly the use of roadblocks to stop pickets travelling from county to county during the 1984–1985 Miners' Strike during an appearance on the BBC's \"Question Time\" in April 1984.\n\nIn December 1986, Anderton's remark that homosexuals, drug addicts and prostitutes who had HIV/AIDS were \"swirling in a human cesspit of their own making\" received widespread criticism. Lawrence Byford, Inspector of Constabulary said \"Mr Anderton was told that some of his recent public statements had brought ridicule upon both the association and the police service and had helped fuel the case of left wing militants\", adding:\n\"He is his own worst enemy. At his best he captures the public's imagination and support when he articulates his views so persuasively but then he tends to ruin his fruitful endeavours by going too far with his extreme language and religious overtones.\"\n\nAnderton supported the reintroduction of corporal punishment for criminals saying in a December 1987 \"Woman's Own\" interview that: \"Corporal punishment should be administered so that [criminals] actually beg for mercy. They should be punished until they repent of their sins. I'd thrash some criminals myself, most surely.\" Anderton also called for the castration of rapists and renewed his attack on gay men, saying:\"The law of the land allows consenting adult homosexuals to engage in sexual practises which I think should be criminal offences. Sodomy between males is an abhorrent offence, condemned by the word of God, and ought to be against the criminal law.\"\nHowever, he did comment that capital punishment was not a deterrent and \"it serves no purpose to shorten one person's life. We are all going to die\".\n\nAnderton was and remains a deeply polarising figure in both British policing and in the history of Manchester. Many sections of public opinion admired his outspoken and independent style of leadership as well as his tough approach to policing and crime. \nHowever other sections viewed Anderton as a populist, reactionary, autocratic chief constable, insensitive to the concerns of minority groups, who personified an authoritarian style of policing. Anderton's pronouncements on public morality led to frequent accusations by his critics of bigotry and religious fanaticism.\n\nAmong rank-and-file Greater Manchester officers, Anderton was revered as a chief constable who cared for their welfare and who would defend them against unfair criticism whilst upholding high professional standards and discipline. After his retirement, the head of the GMP Police Federation stated that GMP officers had frequently got into violent arguments with outside officers who were critical of their chief constable. However, his critics within the police service felt that the publicity given to Anderton's religious views and his outspokenness on moral issues overshadowed his abilities as chief constable of Greater Manchester. \n\nAnderton was also able to count on the support of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. According to documents released in 2012, Margaret Thatcher had supported Anderton after he made his AIDS remark and used her position to prevent an inquiry into his conduct. However, his outspokenness might have cost him an appointment as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Anderton was seen as a potential successor to David McNee in 1982 and a leading contender following the retirement of Kenneth Newman in 1987.\n\nAnderton served as President of the Association of Chief Police Officers from 1986 to 1987 and received a knighthood in 1990, before retiring the following year.\n\nAs Britain's most prominent and controversial chief constable, combined with his distinctive physical appearance, Anderton was often depicted in fiction, almost universally in a critical fashion. In 1990, the BBC musical satire on Margaret Thatcher \"Ten Glorious Years\" showed actor Ricky Tomlinson portray James Anderton in the style of a US-style Moral Majority television evangelist preaching against \"Poofs\" and \"Pinkos\". In the same year, the Happy Mondays song \"God's Cop\" (from their album \"Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches\") lampooned Anderton, who was still in office at the time.\n\nIn the same vein, Anderton was also the – sometimes thinly veiled – inspiration of various fictional characters. In the first season of the Rik Mayall satire \"The New Statesman\", police chief Sir Malachi Jellicoe (John Woodvine) believed himself to be in direct contact with Christ, and to be doing His will on earth. In 1989, he was caricatured as \"James Appleton\" in David Britton's satirical novel \"Lord Horror\". The novel recited Anderton's AIDS remark, replacing the word \"homosexuals\" with \"Jews\", resulting in the book being banned and Britton imprisoned for four months.\n\n"}

He is most well known as the last 'full-blooded' Aboriginal Tasmanian man.\n\nIn 1842 he was the youngest child in the last family taken to the Aboriginal camp at Wybalenna on Flinders Island by George Augustus Robinson. His native name is lost, probably because at 7 he was too young when arriving at Wybalenna and so the English name William he was given there stuck.\n\nIn 1847, he temporarily moved to Oyster Cove, and was sent to an orphanage in Hobart until 1851. In 1855 he joined a whaling ship and regularly visited Oyster Cove when he had time.\n\nLanne died on 3 March 1869 from a combination of cholera and dysentery.\nFollowing his death, Lanne's body was dismembered and used for scientific purposes. An argument broke out between the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the Royal Society of Tasmania over who should possess his remains. A member of the English College of Surgeons named William Crowther, applied to the government for permission to send the skeleton to the Royal College of Surgeons in London, but his request was denied.\n\nNonetheless, Crowther managed to break into the morgue where Lanne's body was kept and decapitated the corpse, removed the skin and inserted a skull from a white body into the black skin. The Tasmanian Royal Society soon discovered Crowther's work, and decided to thwart any further attempts to collect \"samples\" by amputating the hands and feet. Lanne was then buried in this state.\n\nBecause he was accused of the theft of Lanne's head (and the illicit use of another white person's head), Crowther's honorary appointment as surgeon at the Colonial Hospital was terminated. Yet in 1869, the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons awarded him a gold medal and the first Fellowship of the College ever awarded to an Australian. Crowther later became Premier of Tasmania. Crowther claimed that, because Lanne had lived much of his life within the European community, his brain had exhibited physical changes, demonstrating \"the improvement that takes place in the lower race when subjected to the effects of education and civilisation.\"\n\nOther colonists took note of Crowther's act:\n\nAlthough it is not known for certain what happened to the stolen remains of Lanne, a report in The Times in 1912 headed \"Conversazione of the Royal Society: recent advances in science\" mentions the exhibition of \"the desiccated brain of an aboriginal Tasmanian\"\n\nSeveral bodies of Crowther's collection were donated to the anatomy department at the University of Edinburgh. In the 1990s, the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre believed Lanne's skull to be among them, and requested their return. The remains of Aboriginals were ultimately returned and reburied, though the university officially denied that any of the remains belonged to Lanne.\n\nWilliam Lanne's name is believed to be the source of the \"King Billy Pine\", or Athrotaxis selaginoides, a native Tasmanian tree whose wood is renowned for its durability to rot and insects.\n\n"}
{"id": "2061993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2061993", "title": "Impurity", "text": "Impurity\n\nImpurities are chemical substances inside a confined amount of liquid, gas, or solid, which differ from the chemical composition of the material or compound.\n\nImpurities are either naturally occurring or added during synthesis of a chemical or commercial product. During production, impurities may be purposely, accidentally, inevitably, or incidentally added into the substance.\n\nThe levels of impurities in a material are generally defined in relative terms. Standards have been established by various organizations that attempt to define the permitted levels of various impurities in a manufactured product. Strictly speaking, then a material's level of purity can only be stated as being more or less pure than some other material.\n\nImpurities can be destructive when they obstruct the working nature of the material. Examples include ash and debris in metals and leaf pieces in blank white papers. The removal of impurities is usually done chemically. For example, in the manufacturing of iron, calcium carbonate is added to the blast furnace to remove silicon dioxide from the iron ore. Zone refining is an economically important method for the purification of semiconductors.\n\nHowever, some kinds of impurities can be removed by physical means. A mixture of water and salt can be separated by distillation, with water as the distillate and salt as the solid residue. Impurities are usually physically removed from liquids and gases. Removal of sand particles from metal ore is one example with solids.\n\nNo matter what method is used, it is usually impossible to separate an impurity completely from a material. The reason that it is impossible to remove impurities completely is of thermodynamic nature and is predicted by the second law of thermodynamics. Removing impurities completely means reducing the entropy of the system to zero. This would require an infinite amount of work and energy as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics. What technicians can do is to increase the purity of a material to as near 100% as possible or economically feasible.\n\nWhen an impure liquid is cooled to its melting point the liquid, undergoing a phase transition, crystallizes around the impurities and becomes a crystalline solid. If there are no impurities then the liquid is said to be pure and can be supercooled below its melting point without becoming a solid. This occurs because the liquid has nothing to condense around so the solid cannot form a natural crystalline solid. The solid is eventually formed when dynamic arrest or glass transition occurs, but it forms into an amorphous solid – a glass, instead, as there is no long-range order in the structure.\n\nImpurities play an important role in the nucleation of other phase transitions. For example, the presence of foreign elements may have important effects on the mechanical and magnetic properties of metal alloys. Iron atoms in copper cause the renowned Kondo effect where the conduction electron spins form a magnetic bound state with the impurity atom. Magnetic impurities in superconductors can serve as generation sites for vortex defects. Point defects can nucleate reversed domains in ferromagnets and dramatically affect their coercivity. In general impurities are able to serve as initiation points for phase transitions because the energetic cost of creating a finite-size domain of a new phase is lower at a point defect. In order for the nucleus of a new phase to be stable, it must reach a critical size. This threshold size is often lower at an impurity site.\n\n\n"}

After complete economic integration, the integrated units have no or negligible control of economic policy, including full monetary union and complete or near-complete fiscal policy harmonisation.\n\nComplete economic integration is most common within countries, rather than within supranational institutions. An example of this are the original thirteen colonies of the United States of America, which can be viewed as a series of highly integrated quasi-autonomous nation states. In this example it is true that complete economic integration results in a federalist system of governance as it requires political union to function as, in effect, a single economy.\n\nPolitical integration is required because for an economic union to be most effective it is necessary for all provinces to be at the same stage of the economic cycle. Although \"provinces\" is a narrow description as within a specific geographic area there is a much greater amount of mini-economies, all in different stages of the economic cycle; it is in theory possible for a single town to be in recession/boom whilst another is experiencing the opposite. In a practical sense it is best for as many of these economic microcosms to be at the same stage of the economic cycle as possible as it results in government policy having its effectiveness maximized, whether it be through the employment of fiscal or monetary policy.\n\nTo achieve economic harmonization requires increasing central control to pursue an economic area wide policy of inflation combatance and stability promotion. Though this is often viewed as a loss of provincial political sovereignty it is necessary to remove disparities and thus unfair advantages with certain firms across the economic area to provide the best conditions possible for the promotion of competition and therefore economic efficiency.\n\n"}

According to the principle of induction, a solution to the simplest case makes the solution of the next complicated case obvious. Once the simplest case of the induction puzzle is solved, the whole puzzle is solved subsequently. \n\nTypical tell-tale features of these puzzles include any puzzle in which each participant has a given piece of information about all other participants but not themselves. Also, usually, some kind of hint is given to suggest that the participants can trust each other's intelligence — they are capable of theory of mind.\n\nMuddy children puzzle is the most frequently appearing induction puzzle in scientific literature on epistemic logic. In February 2020, 437 hits on Google scholar mentioned the muddy children puzzle. Muddy children puzzle is a variant of the well known wise men or cheating wives/husbands puzzles.\n\nHat puzzles are induction puzzle variations that date back to as early as 1961. In many variations, hat puzzles are described in the context of prisoners. In other cases, hat puzzles are described in the context of wise men.\n\nThere is a set of attentive children. They think perfectly logically. The children consider it possible to have a muddy face. None of the children can determine the state of his or her face him- or herself. But, every child knows the state of all other children's faces. A custodian tells the children that at least one of them has a muddy face. Hereafter, the custodian starts to count and after every stroke, every muddy child has an opportunity to step forward.\n\nLet's assume that there just 2 children: Alice and Bob. If only Alice is dirty, she will step forward at the first stroke, because she does not see any other dirty faces. The same is for Bob. If Alice sees Bob not stepping forward at the first stroke, she must conclude that he certainly sees another muddy child and they will step forward simultaneously at the second stroke.\n\nLet's assume that there just 3 children: Alice, Bob, and Charly. If there are less than 3 muddy children, the puzzle evolves like in the case with 2 children. If Charly sees that Alice and Bob are muddy and not stepping forward at the second stoke, they all together will step forward at the third stoke.\n\nIt can be proven that formula_1 muddy children will step forward after formula_1 strokes.\n\nMuddy children puzzle can also be solved using backward induction from game theory. Muddy children puzzle can be represented as a extensive form game of imperfect information. Every player has two actions — stay back and step forwards. There is a move by nature at the start of the game, which determines the childen with and without muddy faces. Children do not communicate as in non-cooperative games. Every stroke is a simultaneous move by children. It is a sequential game of unlimited length. The game-theoretic solution needs some additional assumptions:\n\nIf only Alice is muddy, the last assumption makes it irrational for her to hesitate. If Alice and Bob are muddy, Alice knows that Bob's only reason of staying back after the first stroke is the apprehension to receive the big penalty of stepping forward without a muddy face. In the case with formula_1 muddy children, receiving formula_1 times the minor penalty is still better than the big penalty.\n\nThe King called the three wisest men in the country to his court to decide who would become his new advisor. He placed a hat on each of their heads, such that each wise man could see all of the other hats, but none of them could see their own. Each hat was either white or blue. The king gave his word to the wise men that at least one of them was wearing a blue hat; in other words, there could be one, two, or three blue hats, but not zero. The king also announced that the contest would be fair to all three men. The wise men were also forbidden to speak to each other. The king declared that whichever man stood up first and correctly announced the colour of his own hat would become his new advisor. The wise men sat for a very long time before one stood up and correctly announced the answer. What did he say, and how did he work it out?\n\nThe King's Wise Men is one of the simplest induction puzzles and one of the clearest indicators to the method used.\n\n\nSince there must be three blue hats, the first man to figure that out will stand up and say blue.\n\nAlternative solution: This does not require the rule that the contest be fair to each. Rather it relies on the fact that they are all wise men, and that it takes some time before they arrive at a solution.\nThere can only be 3 scenarios, one blue hat, two blue hats or 3 blue hats. If there was only one blue hat, then the wearer of that hat would see two white hats, and quickly know that he has to have a blue hat, so he would stand up and announce this straight away. Since this hasn't happened, then there must be at least two blue hats. If there were two blue hats, than either one of those wearing a blue hat would look across and see one blue hat and one white hat, but not know the colour of their own hat. If the first wearer of the blue hat assumed he had a white hat, he would know that the other wearer of the blue hat would be seeing two white hats, and thus the 2nd wearer of the blue hat would have already stood up and announced he was wearing a blue hat. Thus, since this hasn't happened, the first wearer of the blue hat would know he was wearing a blue hat, and could stand up and announce this. Since either one or two blue hats is so easy to solve, and that no one has stood up quickly, then they must all be wearing blue hats.\n\nIn Josephine's Kingdom every woman has to pass a logic exam before being allowed to marry. Every married woman knows about the fidelity of every man in the Kingdom \"except\" for her own husband, and etiquette demands that no woman should be told about the fidelity of her husband. Also, a gunshot fired in any house in the Kingdom will be heard in any other house. Queen Josephine announced that at least one unfaithful man had been discovered in the Kingdom, and that any woman knowing her husband to be unfaithful was required to shoot him at midnight following the day after she discovered his infidelity. How did the wives manage this?\n\nJosephine's Problem is another good example of a general case.\n\n\nThis problem is also known as the Cheating Husbands Problem, the Unfaithful Wives Problem, the Muddy Children Problem. It is logically identical to the Blue Eyes Problem.\n\nThis problem also appears as a problem involving black hats and white hats in C. L. Liu's classic textbook 'Elements of Discrete Mathematics'.\n\nAt the Secret Convention of Logicians, the Master Logician placed a band on each attendee's head, such that everyone else could see it but the person themselves could not. There were many different colours of band. The Logicians all sat in a circle, and the Master instructed them that a bell was to be rung in the forest at regular intervals: at the moment when a Logician knew the colour on his own forehead, he was to leave at the next bell. They were instructed not to speak, nor to use a mirror or camera or otherwise avoid using logic to determine their band colour. In case any impostors had infiltrated the convention, anyone failing to leave on time would be gruffly removed at the correct time. Similarly, anyone trying to leave early would be gruffly held in place and removed at the correct time. The Master reassured the group by stating that the puzzle would not be impossible for any True Logician present. How did they do it?\n\nAlice at the convention of Logicians is general induction plus a leap of logic.\n\n\nA number of players are each wearing a hat, which may be of various specified colours. Players can see the colours of at least some other players' hats, but not that of their own. With highly restricted communication or none, some of the players must guess the colour of their hat. The problem is to find a strategy for the players to determine the colours of their hats based on the hats they see and what the other players do. In some versions, they compete to be the first to guess correctly; in others, they can work out a strategy beforehand to cooperate and maximize the probability of correct guesses.\n\nOne variation received some new publicity as a result of Todd Ebert's 1998 Ph.D. thesis at the University of California, Santa Barbara. It is a strategy question about a cooperative game, which has connections to algebraic coding theory.\n\nThree players are told that each of them will receive either a red hat or a blue hat. They are to raise their hands if they see a red hat on another player as they stand in a circle facing each other. The first to guess the colour of his or her hat correctly wins.\n\nAll three players raise their hands. After the players have seen each other for a few minutes without guessing, one player announces \"Red\", and wins. How did the winner do it, and what is the color of everyone's hats?\n\nFirst, if two people had blue hats, not everyone's hand would have been raised. Next, if player 1 had seen a blue hat on player 2 & a red hat on player 3, then player 1 would have known immediately that his own hat must be red. Thus any player who sees a blue hat can guess at once. Finally, the winner realizes that since no one guesses at once, there must be no blue hats, so every hat must be red.\n\nIn the case where every player has to make a guess, but they are free to choose when to guess, there is a cooperative strategy that allows every player to guess correctly unless all the hats are the same colour. Each player should act as follows:\n\n\nSuppose that in total there are \"B\" black hats and \"W\" white hats. There are three cases.\n\nIf \"B\" = \"W\" then those players wearing black hats see \"B−1\" black hats and \"B\" white hats, so wait \"B\"−1 seconds then correctly guess that they are wearing a black hat. Similarly, those players wearing a white hat will wait \"W\"−1 seconds before guessing correctly that they are wearing a white hat. So all players make a correct guess at the same time.\n\nIf \"B\" < \"W\" then those wearing a black hat will see \"B\"−1 black hats and \"W\" white hats, whilst those wearing a white hat will see \"B\" black hats and \"W\"−1 white hats. Since \"B\"−1 < \"B\" ≤ \"W\"−1, those players wearing a black hat will be the first to speak, guessing correctly that their hat is black. The other players then guess correctly that their hat is white.\n\nThe case where \"W\" < \"B\" is similar.\n\nAccording to the story, four prisoners are arrested for a crime, but the jail is full and the jailer has nowhere to put them. He eventually comes up with the solution of giving them a puzzle so if they succeed they can go free but if they fail they are executed.\n\nThe jailer seats three of the men into a line. B faces the wall, C faces B, and D faces C and B. The fourth man, A, is put behind a screen (or in a separate room). The jailer gives all four men party hats. He explains that there are two black hats and two white hats, that each prisoner is wearing one of the hats, and that each of the prisoners see only the hats in front of him but neither on himself nor behind him. The fourth man behind the screen can't see or be seen by any other prisoner. No communication among the prisoners is allowed.\n\nIf any prisoner can figure out what color hat he has on his own head with 100% certainty (without guessing) he must then announce it, \"and all four prisoners go free\". If any prisoner suggests an incorrect answer, all four prisoners are executed. The puzzle is to find how the prisoners can escape.\n\nThe prisoners know that there are only two hats of each color. So if D observes that B and C have hats of the same color, D would deduce that his own hat is the opposite color. However, if B and C have hats of different colors, then D can say nothing. The key is that prisoner C, after allowing an appropriate interval, and knowing what D would do, can deduce that if D says nothing the hats on B and C must be different; able to see B's hat, he can deduce his own hat color.\n\nIn common with many puzzles of this type, the solution relies upon the assumption that all participants are totally rational and intelligent enough to make the appropriate deductions.\n\nAfter solving this puzzle, some insight into the nature of communication can be gained by pondering whether the meaningful silence of prisoner D violates the \"No communication\" rule (given that communication is usually defined as the \"transfer of information\").\n\nIn this variant there are 3 prisoners and 3 hats. Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue. In all, there are three red hats and two blue. Each person can see the hats of two others, but not their own. On a cue, they each have to guess their own hat color or pass. They win release if at least one person guessed correctly and none guessed incorrectly (passing is neither correct nor incorrect).\n\nThis puzzle doesn't have a 100% winning strategy, so the question is: What is the best strategy? Which strategy has the highest probability of winning?\n\nIf you think of colors of hats as bits, this problem has some important applications in coding theory.\n\nThe solution and the discussion of this puzzle can be found here (also a solution to the analogous 7-hat puzzle) and other 3 variants are available on this Logic Puzzles page (they are called Masters of Logic I-IV).\n\nIn a variant of this puzzle, the prisoners know that there are 3 hats of one color and only 1 hat of another (e.g. 3 black and 1 white), and the 3 prisoners can see each other i.e. D sees B & C, B sees D & C, and C sees D & B. (A again cannot be seen and is only there to wear the last hat.)\n\nThere are two cases: in the trivial case, one of the three prisoners wears the single off-color hat. Each of the other two prisoners can see that one prisoner is wearing the off-color hat.\nIn the non-trivial case, the three prisoners wear hats of the same color, while A wears the off-color hat.\nAfter a while, all three prisoners should be able to deduce that, because neither of the others was able to state the color of his own hat, A must wear the off-color hat.\n\nIn another variant, only three prisoners and five hats (supposedly two black and three white) are involved. \nThe three prisoners are ordered to stand in a straight line facing the front, with A in front and C at the back. They are told that there will be two black hats and three white hats. One hat is then put on each prisoner's head; each prisoner can only see the hats of the people in front of him and not on his own. The first prisoner that is able to announce the color of his hat correctly will be released. No communication between the prisoners is allowed.\n\nAssume that A wears a black hat: \nSo if A wears a black hat there will be a fairly quick response from B or C.\n\nAssume that A wears a white hat: \nIn this case A, B and C would remain silent for some time, until A finally deduces that he must have a white hat because C and B have remained silent for some time.\n\nAs mentioned, there are three white hats and two black hats in total, and the three prisoners know this. In this riddle, you can assume that all three prisoners are very clever and very smart. If C could not guess the color of his own hat that is because he saw either two white hats or one of each color. If he saw two black hats, he could have deduced that he was wearing a white hat.\n\nIn this variant there are 10 prisoners and 10 hats. Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue, but the number of each color hat is not known to the prisoners. The prisoners will be lined up single file where each can see the hats in front of him but not behind. Starting with the prisoner in the back of the line and moving forward, they must each, in turn, say only one word which must be \"red\" or \"blue\". If the word matches their hat color they are released, if not, they are killed on the spot. A sympathetic guard warns them of this test one hour beforehand and tells them that they can formulate a plan where by following the stated rules, 9 of the 10 prisoners will definitely survive, and 1 has a 50/50 chance of survival. What is the plan to achieve the goal?\n\nThe prisoners agree that if the first prisoner sees an odd number of red hats, he will say \"red\". This way, the nine other prisoners will know their own hat color after the prisoner behind them responds.\n\nAs before, there are 10 prisoners and 10 hats. Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue, but the number of each color hat is not known to the prisoners. The prisoners are distributed in the room such that they can see the hats of the others but not their own. Now, they must each, simultaneously, say only one word which must be \"red\" or \"blue\". If the word matches their hat color they are released, and if enough prisoners resume their liberty they can rescue the others. A sympathetic guard warns them of this test one hour beforehand. If they can formulate a plan following the stated rules, 5 of the 10 prisoners will definitely be released and be able to rescue the others. What is the plan to achieve the goal?\n\nThe prisoners pair off. In a pair (A, B) of the prisoners A says the color he can see on the head of B, who says the opposite color he sees on the head of A. Then, if both wear hats with the same color, A is released (and B is not), if the colors are different, B is released (and A is not). In total, 5 prisoners answer correctly and 5 do not. This assumes the pair can communicate who is A and who is B, which may not be allowed.\n\nAlternatively, the prisoners build two groups of 5. One group assumes that the number of red hats is even, the other assumes that there is an odd number of red hats. Similar to the variant with hearing, they can deduce their hat color out of this assumption. Exactly one group will be right, so 5 prisoners answer correctly and 5 do not.\n\nNote that the prisoners cannot find a strategy guaranteeing the release of more than 5 prisoners. Indeed, for a single prisoner, there are as many distributions of hat colors where he says the correct answer than there are where he does not. Hence, there are as many distributions of hat colors where 6 or more prisoners say the correct answer than there are where 4 or fewer do so.\n\nIn this variant, a countably infinite number of prisoners, each with an unknown and randomly assigned red or blue hat line up single file line. Each prisoner faces away from the beginning of the line, and each prisoner can see all the hats in front of him, and none of the hats behind. Starting from the beginning of the line, each prisoner must correctly identify the color of his hat or he is killed on the spot. As before, the prisoners have a chance to meet beforehand, but unlike before, once in line, no prisoner can hear what the other prisoners say. The question is, is there a way to ensure that only finitely many prisoners are killed?\n\nIf one accepts the axiom of choice, and assumes the prisoners each have the (unrealistic) ability to memorize an uncountably infinite amount of information and perform computations with uncountably infinite computational complexity, the answer is yes. In fact, even if we allow an uncountable number of different colors for the hats and an uncountable number of prisoners, the axiom of choice provides a solution that guarantees that only finitely many prisoners must die provided that each prisoner can see the hats of every other prisoner (not just those ahead of them in a line), or at least that each prisoner can see all but finitely many of the other hats. The solution for the two color case is as follows, and the solution for the uncountably infinite color case is essentially the same:\n\nThe prisoners standing in line form a sequence of 0s and 1s, where 0 is taken to represent blue, and 1 is taken to represent red. Before they are put into the line, the prisoners define the following equivalence relation over all possible sequences that they might be put into: Two sequences are equivalent if they are identical after a finite number of entries. From this equivalence relation, the prisoners get a collection of equivalence classes. Assuming the axiom of choice, there exists a set of representative sequences—one from each equivalence class. (Almost every specific value is impossible to compute, but the axiom of choice implies that \"some\" set of values exists, so we assume that the prisoners have access to an oracle.)\n\nWhen they are put into their line, each prisoner can see all but a finite number of hats, and can therefore see which equivalence class the \"actual\" sequence of hats belongs to. (This assumes that each prisoner can perform an \"uncountably infinite\" number of comparisons to find a match, with each class comparison requiring a \"countably infinite\" number of individual hat-comparisons). They then proceed guessing their hat color as if they were in the \"representative\" sequence from the appropriate equivalence class. Because the actual sequence and the representative sequence are in the same equivalence class, their entries are the same after some finite number \"N\" of prisoners. All prisoners after these first \"N\" prisoners are saved.\n\nBecause the prisoners have no information about the color of their own hat and would make the same guess whichever color it has, each prisoner has a 50% chance of being killed. It may seem paradoxical that an infinite number of prisoners each have an even chance of being killed and yet it is certain that only a finite number are killed. The solution to this paradox lies in the fact that the function employed to determine each prisoner's guess is not Measurable function.\n\nTo see this, consider the case of zero prisoners being killed. This happens if and only if the actual sequence is one of the selected representative sequences. If the sequences of 0s and 1s are viewed as binary representations of a real number between 0 and 1, the representative sequences form a non-measurable set. (This set is similar to a Vitali set, the only difference being that equivalence classes are formed with respect to numbers with finite binary representations rather than all rational numbers.) Hence no probability can be assigned to the event of zero prisoners being killed. The argument is similar for other finite numbers of prisoners being killed, corresponding to a finite number of variations of each representative.\n\nThis variant is the same as the last one except that prisoners can hear the colors called out by other prisoners. The question is, what is the optimal strategy for the prisoners such that the fewest of them die in the worst case?\n\nIt turns out that, if one allows the prisoners to hear the colors called out by the other prisoners, it is possible to guarantee the life of every prisoner except the first, who dies with a 50% probability.\n\nTo do this, we define the same equivalence relation as above and again select a representative sequence from each equivalence class. Now, we label every sequence in each class with either a 0 or a 1. First, we label the representative sequence with a 0. Then, we label any sequence which differs from the representative sequence in an even number of places with a 0, and any sequence which differs from the representative sequence in an odd number of places with a 1. In this manner, we have labeled every possible infinite sequence with a 0 or a 1 with the important property that any two sequences which differ by only one digit have opposite labels.\n\nNow, when the warden asks the first person to say a color, or in our new interpretation, a 0 or a 1, he simply calls out the label of the sequence he sees. Given this information, everyone after him can determine exactly what his own hat color is. The second person sees all but the first digit of the sequence that the first person sees. Thus, as far as he knows, there are two possible sequences the first person could have been labeling: one starting with a 0, and one starting with a 1. Because of our labeling scheme, these two sequences would receive opposite labels, so based on what the first person says, the second person can determine which of the two possible strings the first person saw, and thus he can determine his own hat color. Similarly, every later person in the line knows every digit of the sequence except the one corresponding to his own hat color. He knows those before him because they were called out, and those after him because he can see them. With this information, he can use the label called out by the first person to determine his own hat color. Thus, everyone except the first person always guesses correctly.\n\nEbert's version of the problem states that all players who guess must guess at the same predetermined time, but that not all players are required to guess. Now not all players can guess correctly, so the players win if at least one player guesses and all of those who guess do so correctly. How can the players maximise their chance of winning?\n\nOne strategy for solving this version of the hat problem employs Hamming codes, which are commonly used to detect and correct errors in data transmission. The probability for winning will be much higher than 50%, depending on the number of players in the puzzle configuration: for example, a winning probability of 87.5% for 7 players.\n\nSimilar strategies can be applied to team sizes of \"N\" = 2−1 and achieve a win rate (2-1)/2. Thus the Hamming code strategy yields greater win rates for larger values of \"N\".\n\nIn this version of the problem, any individual guess has a 50% chance of being right. However, the Hamming code approach works by concentrating wrong guesses together onto certain distributions of hats. For some cases, all the players will guess incorrectly; whereas for the other cases, only one player will guess, but correctly. While half of all guesses are still incorrect, this results in the players winning more than 50% of the time.\n\nA simple example of this type of solution with three players is instructive. With three players, there are eight possibilities; in two of them all players have the same colour hat, and in the other six, two players have one colour and the other player has the other colour.\n\nThe players can guarantee that they win in the latter cases (75% of the time) with the following strategy:\n\nIn the two cases when all three players have the same hat colour, they will all guess incorrectly. But in the other six cases, only one player will guess, and correctly, that his hat is the opposite of his fellow players'.\n\nSneetches are creatures from Dr. Seuss's famous story \"The Sneetches\". There are two types of Sneetches, star-bellied and plain-bellied. All Sneetches must pass a logic test to live in Sneetchville, which has a limited number of homes and has a strict housing law that each home must contain no more than one star-bellied Sneetch and one plain-bellied Sneetch. No Sneetch is able to see its own belly, but can still see all other Sneetches' bellies. To prevent further conflict among the Sneetches, there is a law that forbids Sneetches to discuss their bellies. Each Sneetch cannot skip a home until it is sure that it cannot move in. If a Sneetch breaks the law, it is executed. How do the Sneetches choose their homes?\n\nSince all Sneetches are potentially at risk, one solution is for all Sneetches to meet in the street; the model indicates homes, therefore a road, street or close. There, they agree to move towards Sneetches that look similar and away from Sneetches that look dissimilar; this obviates the need to specifically communicate regarding physical characteristics, i.e., belly state. Sneetch movement begins with Brownian motion but as in the logic of the muddy children problem, this turns to clumping, e.g., one Sneetch moving towards two similar sneetches being accepted or rejected by them, or vice versa, and eventually a single state space of two groups results, the star-bellied and plain bellied. One Sneetch from the first group goes first to each house, then one Sneetch from the second group goes to each house.\n\n"}

In HMI Products, Neonode provides plug-and-play sensor modules that enable touch on any surface, in-air touch, and gesture control. In Remote Sensing Solutions, Neonode offers a software platform for driver and cabin monitoring.\n\nNeonode was founded in 2001 as a mobile phone company.\n\nThe first mobile phone prototype was launched at the German IT-fair CeBit in March 2002 and yielded quite a bit of attention. Around Christmas the same year, a press conference was held at Fryshuset in Stockholm. The massive attention they received resulted in 20.000 mobile phones being pre-ordered. Using their two patented technologies, zForce and Neno, Neonode AB had developed three mobile phone models: N1, N1m and N2. They all shared a similar design, featuring a large optic touch screen in color.\n\nNeonode AB was responsible for the development and marketing of the mobile phones. The company had about 30 employees and was situated on Biblioteksgatan, close to Stureplan in Stockholm. Production of the phones took place in Malaysia.\n\nIn November 2008, the company attempted issue equity, but failed. On December 9, 2008, Neonode declared bankruptcy. The company was immediately started up again by Thomas Eriksson. The business of the parent company Neonode Inc and Neonode Technologies AB, located in Sweden, which is the R&D headquarters, has since been the licensing of the zForce technology.\n\nIn 2009, the company released an updated version of the touch-technology zForce (zero force).\n\nIn 2010, zForce was awarded the title \"Best New Technology of the Year\" by the magazine Mobil.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011 the company’s technology was incorporated in products in the e-reader segment.\n\nIn 2013 the company’s technology was incorporated in products in the printer and automotive segments.\n\nIn 2016 the company launched a commercial product, the AirBar touchscreen sensor, that transforms a non-touchscreen laptop into a touchscreen laptop.

Preganglionic oculomotor neurons within the Edinger–Westphal nucleus shall be referred to as the \"EWpg\", and the neuropeptide-containing neurons shall be known as the centrally-projecting Edinger Westphal nucleus, or \"EWcp\".\n\nThe paired nuclei are posterior to the main motor nucleus (oculomotor nucleus) and anterolateral to the cerebral aqueduct in the rostral midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus.\n\nIt is the most rostral of the parasympathetic nuclei in the brain stem.\n\nThe Edinger–Westphal nucleus supplies preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the eye, constricting the pupil, accommodating the lens, and convergence of the eyes.\n\nIt has also been implicated in the mirroring of pupil size in sad facial expressions. When seeing a sad face, participants' pupils dilated or constricted to mirror the face they saw, which predicted both how sad they perceived the face to be, as well as activity within this region.\n\nThe nucleus is named for both Ludwig Edinger, from Frankfurt, who demonstrated it in the fetus in 1885, and for Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal, from Berlin, who demonstrated it in the adult in 1887.\n\n"}

This was exhibited at the Crystal Palace Show, and could carry a load of 1 ton. It was fitted with a Thornycroft marine launch-type boiler (Thornycroft announced a new boiler designed for its steam carriages in October 1897). The engine was a twin-cylinder compound engine arranged so that high-pressure steam could be admitted to the low-pressure cylinder to give extra power for hill-climbing. A modified version of the steam wagon with a 6-cubic-yard tipper body was developed for Chiswick council in 1896 and went into service as a very early self-propelled dust-cart. While the original 1896 wagon had front-wheel drive with rear-wheel steering, the tipper dust-cart had rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steering. The Thornycroft tipper was built by the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works, though engined by Thornycroft.\n\nThornycroft's first petrol vehicle was built in 1902, and the company completed the move into internal combustion engine power in 1907. \n\nThornycroft's Basingstoke factory supplied nearly 5,000 motor vehicles for the World War I effort. It also provided large numbers of engines of various powers to the Admiralty, War Office and other government departments at the beginning of the war and for the next two years. Thereafter the Basingstoke factory manufactured marine engines for the Coastal Motor Boats being built at the John I. Thornycroft & Company works in Woolston, Southampton. It also made the Thornycroft depth-charge thrower for anti-submarine warfare.\n\nFrom 1931, Thornycroft used names for its vehicle range – descriptive and colourful ones. During World War II the company designed the Terrapin and other war-related vehicles.\n\nIn 1948, the company name was changed to Transport Equipment (Thornycroft) Ltd to prevent confusion with the shipbuilding Thornycroft company. The company was well known for providing fire engine chassis, with multi-axle drive for uses such as airports. A limited number of 4x4 chassis were also provided to Worcester-based fire engine manufacturer, Carmichael for sale to civilian brigades in the 1950s.\n\nThornycroft was taken over on 1 March 1961 by AEC parent Associated Commercial Vehicles (ACV), with production limited to Antars, Big Bens and Nubians, although the Thornycroft-designed six-speed constant mesh gearbox was used in AEC and later medium weight Albion and Leyland trucks. ACV was taken over by Leyland in 1962. Leyland already had a specialist vehicle unit in Scammell. Vehicle production at Basingstoke ceased in 1969 with production transferred to Scammell at Watford. The factory continued to manufacture gearboxes. It was sold in 1972 to Eaton Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was an early African-American graduate of the University of Iowa and the first to graduate from the University of Iowa's College of Engineering. He was also a governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAlexander was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, the son of Price and Mary Alexander. When the family moved to a farm outside Des Moines, Price became head custodian at the Des Moines National Bank. Attending Oak Park Grammar School, Oak Park High School and Highland Park College for one year, Archie began his engineering education at the State University of Iowa (The University of Iowa). When three colleges merged Highland Park College became part of Des Moines College. \"Although he initially went to Des Moines College and attempted to join the white-only American football team there, he was declined. As a result, he played tackle from 1910 to 1912 [at Iowa] and was nicknamed 'Alexander the Great'.\" During the summer Alexander worked as a draftsman for Marsh Engineers, a Des Moines bridge-designing firm and in 1912, he received a bachelor of science degree, becoming the University of Iowa's first black football player and engineer.\n\nAfter graduation, Alexander worked as a foreman for a bridge-building company before going into business for himself in 1917. Continuing his education at the University of London, Alexander studied bridge design in and obtained a degree in civil engineering in 1925 from the State University of Iowa.\n\nIn 1929, he formed Alexander & Repass, where he would work until his death. They were responsible for the construction of many roads and bridges, including the Whitehurst Freeway, the Tidal Basin Bridge, and an extension to the Baltimore–Washington Parkway. With his business partner, George Higbee, Alexander designed the Tuskegee Airfield and the Iowa State University heating and cooling system.\n\nIn 1934, Alexander was appointed as one of a 12-member commission to investigate the social and economic conditions in Haiti. In 1946, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering by Howard University.\n\nIn 1954, Alexander was appointed Governor of the United States Virgin Islands by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the first Republican governor there since the establishment of the civil government. His tenure at the post was short and controversial. In 1955, he was highly criticized for favoring old business partners in contracts for road building on St. Thomas. The United States House of Representatives launched a probe and he subsequently resigned on August 18, 1955, ostensibly for health reasons. He died in 1958 in Des Moines, Iowa. Alexander was also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.\n\nThe Archie Alphonso Alexander Papers are held at the University of Iowa Special Collections & University Archives.\n\nSome sources, including Alexander's obituary in \"The New York Times\", incorrectly credit him as winner of the NAACP's Spingarn Medal in 1928. The award went to author Charles W. Chesnutt; Alexander never received one.\n\n"}

Wood ash from the fires of their altars mingled with the grease from the animal sacrifices, forming a primitive kind of soap. This soap found its way to the clays of a nearby stream, where local people found that it helped them get their laundry cleaner.

{"id": "2062048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062048", "title": "The Isle of Dogs (play)", "text": "The Isle of Dogs (play)\n\nThe Isle of Dogs is a play by Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson which was performed in 1597. It was immediately suppressed, and no copy of it is known to exist.\n\nThe play was performed, probably by Pembroke's Men, at the Swan Theatre in Bankside in July or August 1597. A satirical comedy, it was reported to the authorities as a \"lewd plaie\" full of seditious and \"slanderous matter\". While extant records do not indicate what gave offence, a reference in \"The Returne from Parnassus (II)\" suggests that the Queen herself was satirised. Other evidence suggests that Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham may have been the target.\n\nThe Isle of Dogs is a location in London on the opposite bank of the Thames to Greenwich, home of a royal palace, Placentia, where indeed the Privy Council met. It was also believed to be where the queen kennelled her dogs, hence the name. David Riggs suggests that the satire might have been related to portrayal of the queen's councillors as lapdogs. However, the title alone does not indicate the play's content, since this area was also known as an unhealthy swamp where river sewage would accumulate. The Isle is also mentioned in \"Eastward Hoe\" (1605), another play for which Jonson was arrested. Nashe also referred to the location in \"Summer's Last Will and Testament\": \"Here's a coyle about dogges without wit. If I had thought the ship of fooles would have stayed to take in fresh water at the Ile of dogges I would have furnished it with a whole kennel of collections to the purpose.\"\n\nWhatever the cause, Richard Topcliffe informed Robert Cecil, who raised the issue to the Privy Council. Three of the players (Gabriel Spenser, Robert Shaa, and Ben Jonson) were arrested and sent to Marshalsea Prison. Nashe's home was raided (he was then at Great Yarmouth) and his papers seized, but he escaped imprisonment. He later wrote that he had given birth to a monster — \"it was no sooner borne but I was glad to runne from it.\" Nashe was later to call it \"an imperfit Embrion of my idle houres\" and claimed to have written only the introduction and first act. For his part, Jonson recalled that he said nothing but \"yes and no\". Authorities placed two informers (Robert Poley and someone surnamed Parrot) with him; those two are referred to in his Epigram 59, \"Of Spies\".\n\nAfter this burst of repression, royal authorities appear to have let the matter drop without incident. The report of the initial arrest says that \"the rest of the players or actors in that matter shall be apprehended\", but no one else ever was. Shaa and Spenser were released quickly, and even Jonson was out of jail by early in October. Pembroke's Men were in action again, as were the other companies, before winter of that year. The only party permanently hurt was the Swan's impresario Francis Langley, who alone among the play's producers was not able to obtain relicensing. Langley had apparently run afoul of the Privy Council on an unrelated matter involving a large Portuguese diamond that Langley had fenced, or planned to fence.\n\nThe suppression of \"Isle of Dogs\" has long been understood as a significant episode in the complex relations of city, court, and theatre-worlds; its precise significance, however, is difficult to determine. Chambers, while noting Langley's diamond involvement, viewed the play as related to the Privy Council's 28 July order prohibiting acting and ordering that the theatres be \"plucked down\"; in this view, the leniency shown to the companies later in the year reflects the transient nature of the offence. Others, among them William Ingram, have questioned this chronology. The 28 July order does not mention the play; it was written in response to one of the city authorities' periodic pleas for an end to the theatres. The Council issued specific orders against the play in the next month. In this light, Pembroke's men may have made their offence worse by performing the play (wittingly or not) after the date of prohibition. Moreover, Cecil's anger over the stolen diamond may suggest that Langley was the sole target of the July injunction. Andrew Gurr adds to this picture by noting the tendency of the Court to license two chief companies throughout the later Elizabethan and early Stuart periods.\n\nThe image of \"The Isle of Dogs\" conjured up a society ruined by envy, and Nashe also refers to Sirius the dog star in \"Summer's Last Will and Testament\" in relation to the dog days of July. Richard Lichfield was to taunt Nashe with this in his \"The Trimming of Thomas Nash gentleman\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2062051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062051", "title": "Camp Lazlo", "text": "Camp Lazlo\n\nCamp Lazlo (stylized as CAMP LAZLO!) is an American animated television series created by Joe Murray for Cartoon Network. It follows Lazlo, an anthropomorphic spider monkey who attends Camp Kidney, a Boy Scout-like summer camp in Pimpleback Mountains. Lazlo resides in the \"Jelly Bean\" cabin with his fellow Bean Scouts Raj, an Indian elephant, and Clam, a pygmy rhinoceros. Lazlo is often at odds with his pessimistic camp leader Scoutmaster Lumpus, the second-in-command Slinkman, and other campers. Camp Kidney sits just across the lake from Acorn Flats, which is home to the campsite of the all-female Squirrel Scouts. It was one of the first Cartoon Network Studios series produced in a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, despite originally being broadcast in the full screen aspect ratio of 4:3.\n\n\"Camp Lazlo\" was produced by Cartoon Network Studios. Its style of humor is similar to the Nickelodeon series \"Rocko's Modern Life\", which Murray also created and worked on. The series premiered on Cartoon Network on July 8, 2005, at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT. The series ran for five seasons comprising 61 episodes and the hour-long television special, \"\" The final episode aired on March 27, 2008. During its run, the series won three Emmy Awards and three Pulcinella Awards, and was also nominated for another Emmy and an Annie Award. Spin-off media include DVDs, restaurant promotions, a video game, and digital download releases.\n\nThe series is set in a universe inhabited solely by anthropomorphic animals of many species and focuses on a trio of campers attending a poorly-run summer camp known as Camp Kidney. The trio consists of Lazlo, the eccentric, optimistic spider monkey; Raj, the timid Indian elephant; and Clam, the quiet albino pygmy rhinoceros, and their multiple surreal misadventures.\n\nOther characters include the selfish, ill-tempered moose Scoutmaster Lumpus and his mild-mannered assistant Slinkman the banana slug, the boys' assortment of fellow campers including the disgruntled, surly platypus Edward, the two unintelligent, dirt-loving dung beetles Chip and Skip, and the klutzy, accident-prone, geeky Guinea pig Samson. There's also a rival summer camp called Acorn Flats, which is attended solely by girls, primarily focusing on Lazlo, Raj, and Clam's respective female counterparts attending that camp; Patsy the adventurous mongoose who has a major crush on Lazlo, Gretchen the short-tempered alligator, Nurse Leslie the Nurse Shark Black Rhinoceros who is a Doctor and Nina the bookish, sci-fi-loving giraffe, along with the object of Scoutmaster Lumpus's affections, Miss Doe, the head of Acorn Flats.\n\nMurray said that, as he did in \"Rocko's Modern Life\", he matched the personalities of characters to various animals.\n\nSome episodes may involve the Bean Scouts' attempts at unveiling the truth behind camp legends or clowning around, infuriating their peers or placing themselves in a variety of odd situations commonly based around traditional or fictionalized, bizarre camp activities.\n\nThe setting of the show was designed to deliberately bring a nostalgic feeling of childhood summer camps and \"evoke a comfortable place to visit\". The colors instill the \"feeling\" of summer camp, rather than basing color schemes on real-life colors; Murray and Sue Mondt, the art director, chose the colors. In \"Camp Lazlo\", the sky can be yellow, and trees are not always green and brown. For the architecture and objects, books with cabins, camps and Native American artifacts were consulted. Ultimately, Murray wanted to create a place where nature prevails, and the hustle and bustle of real-life is left behind, with no technology to distract from the impressions of camp life. He describes the camp as having a \"retro\" feel. Murray likes 1950s and early 1960s designs of objects like advertising art, lamps, and old vacation brochures, and he said that the \"brushy quality that developed at that time\" heavily influenced the setting.\n\nAfter \"Rocko's Modern Life\" concluded production, series creator Joe Murray kept a notebook of ideas for television shows and books. Murray attributes some of his most fond memories to days at summer camp; Murray said that he attended summer camp every summer for \"4 or 5 years in a row\" and that he \"couldn't really get the scouting thing down\". He also described cartoons with pastoral settings, such as the Bugs Bunny cartoons of the \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" series and \"Yogi Bear\", as having a \"calming\" effect due to the tree-filled backgrounds. At the time he believed that too many futuristic themes appeared in media and literature, so he wished to create a series that would \"get back to nature\".\n\n\"Camp Lazlo\" originated from a camp-related children's book series concept by Murray that, according to him, \"outgrew its medium\". As Murray developed the concept, he felt that his \"lunatic characters wanted to live\" and decided that a simple story could not sufficiently house his characters. Murray desired to create a series about a group of children without \"high tech stimulus\" and \"in nature\".\n\nLinda Simensky, who had previously worked with Murray on \"Rocko\", had since moved to Cartoon Network and called Murray to solicit a new series. After an initial hesitation, Murray sent Simensky the idea for a show with a working title of \"3 Beans\". Simensky \"thought it sounded too much like a salad\", so Murray changed the name to \"Camp Lazlo\". When approval was given, Murray decided to produce the show at Cartoon Network Studios and his studio Joe Murray Productions, and brought Mark O'Hare on as co-producer.\n\nAccording to Murray, the greenlight to produce \"Lazlo\" had been initially given and later revoked, leaving Murray and Mark O'Hare \"pissed\" and \"depressed\". Murray believed that an executive was not \"completely sold\" by the series, and worked to have the series receive definite approval. Production of \"Camp Lazlo\" began in 2004 and ended in 2007; November 2007 saw the beginning of the series' final production run. The series would later have writers that would go on to create their own shows, such as Thurop Van Orman, who later created \"The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack\" in 2008, and J. G. Quintel, who later created \"Regular Show\" in 2010.\n\nMurray felt that \"Camp Lazlo\" successfully appealed to younger children because his prior experiences with his own children helped him determine details that children found humorous. Murray said that he resisted the urge inside of him to micromanage the production and instead approved aspects and contributions related to the show. He said that he had \"a lot of pre-production time\" and therefore details became established before the show aired on television. His main philosophies expressed in the show include the phrase \"be who you are\" and that one should question authority unless the issue is \"a safety issue.\" Murray said that he avoids sending \"messages\" to children and that he hoped that his television show did not contain \"too many messages.\"\n\nMurray asked many staff members who participated in creating \"Rocko's Modern Life\" to return and perform duties for \"Camp Lazlo\", describing his main tactic to attract the crew as \"coercion\". Murray wanted the \"Rocko's Modern Life\" crew as it \"knows my sensibilities\" and gained ten years of experience. Crew members of \"Rocko's Modern Life\", such as Robert Scull or Peter Burns, have worked on this show. For season one, Murray hired among others comedy writer Martin Olson, who had collaborated with Murray on some of the most successful stories for \"Rocko's Modern Life\".\n\nMurray said that he likes storybook art and the works of Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse; the styles influenced the visual style of \"Camp Lazlo\". He also describes \"great comic book artists\" as important to himself and Mark O'Hare. The team created some backgrounds using \"Acryl Gouache,\" a mixture of acrylic paint and gouache. Rough Draft Studios, a South Korean studio, produced the \"Camp Lazlo\" footage.\n\nMurray asked Tom Kenny to voice characters because Murray felt that Kenny \"adds writing to his roles\" and \"brings so much.\" Murray looked for \"comedic timing\" in his voice actors, and therefore he used many stand-up comics and sketch actors. Carlos Alazraqui, who voiced Rocko from \"Rocko's Modern Life\", voices Lazlo. Mr. Lawrence, who voiced Filburt, voices Edward and the Loons.\n\nThe opening theme song, \"Lazlo Was His Name-O\", was based on the children's folk song \"Bingo\", which was adapted, with new lyrics, by American musician Terry Scott Taylor. The music score for the show was composed by Andy Paley, and features original camp songs, bluegrass and cowboy swing. Joe Murray explained that the team often used \"strange instruments\" such as washboards, and the musical saw. In addition to Paley's music score, the show also utilized many tracks from the Associated Production Music library.\n\nRay Richmond of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" posted his review of the series on July 7, 2005. Richmond said that his child enjoyed the show but did not ask to see it again. Richmond said that the show forms \"plenty lively and a nice, safe way for a child viewer to spend a half-hour\". Richmond said that the show has too much \"self-consciously precious\" humor; the reviewer said that the trait may not factor for children and described children as \"demanding and non-discriminating at the same time.\"\n\nGinia Bellafante of \"The New York Times\" said that if she became \"socio-analytical about the Lazlo enterprise,\" Camp Kidney appears to be a stand-in for \"our culture of obsessive parenting.\"\n\nKathie Huddleston, a reporter for the \"Science Fiction Weekly\", created a favorable review of \"Camp Lazlo\".\n\n\"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" reviewed the series and gave it an \"A.\"\n\nJoly Herman of \"Common Sense Media\" posted a review of the show on Go.com. Herman describes the humor used in the \"Camp Lazlo\" as making it an \"unpredictable show for younger viewers.\" Herman gave the show two stars out of five.\n\n\"Camp Lazlo\" was released in HD remasters partially on Boomerang's streaming service in 2018, completing the HD release of the show in its entirety in June 2019.\n\nPrior to \"Camp Lazlo\"s premiere on Cartoon Network, a Press Kit for the show was given away as a promotional item, containing fact sheets on the show and a DVD with four episodes (2 half-hour episodes): \"Gone Fishin' (Sort of) / Beans Are from Mars\" and \"Parasitic Pal / It's No Picnic\". This item is now only available through a second-hand market.\n\nOn July 18, 2007, Madman Entertainment of Australia released a set of two DVDs encoded for Region 4 of season one episodes. No further information is available about a Region 1 release or additional seasons.\n\nTwo episodes have also appeared on Cartoon Network themed DVDs. \"Hello Dolly\" appeared on the \"Cartoon Network Fridays - Volume 1\" DVD, released on September 19, 2006. \"Snow Beans\", a winter-themed episode of the show, was released on the \"Cartoon Network Christmas: Volume Three\" DVD on October 3, 2006.\n\nThe entire series can now be purchased on digital download.\n\nA video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance called \"Camp Lazlo: Leaky Lake Games\" was released on November 6, 2006, as a tie-in to the show. The game is published by Crave Entertainment and developed by Collision Studios. The player plays as the three main characters (Lazlo, Clam and Raj) to compete in a series of game challenges and earn merit badges in the Leaky Lake Games event. That will allow them to compete against the Squirrel Scouts in a final tournament. In the game, the player meets characters, such as Scoutmaster Lumpus, Mr. Slinkman, Edward, and many others to receive hints and directions in achieving goals in the game. They trigger some of the mini-games, which are all timed. The game received generally mixed reviews.\n\n\"Camp Lazlo\" characters appeared in a 2007 commercial for the international fast food restaurant chain McDonald's, which advertised various Cartoon Network characters being included as action figure toys in Happy Meals, including those from \"Camp Lazlo\". Murray did not want the series to be used in Happy Meals; the only action he could take was refusing to appear in the television commercials. Murray stated on his website that he will not explain his opposition to Happy Meals due to his respect for the effort placed by Cartoon Network \"marketing people\". Murray stated that his opinions are his alone and do not reflect the opinions of Cartoon Network. He said that he appreciates Cartoon Network's \"campaign for unhealthier eating habits for kids\". \"C\" Raggio, a character designer, appeared in the commercials instead.\n\n\n\n"}

Thus many of these railways - especially the dominant Taff Vale Railway - specified and used an 0-6-2T, which gave maximum tractive effort whilst riding well on the undulating track.\n\nWith coal trains increasing in size and scale, the GWR needed to develop a more powerful locomotive to meet these requirements, on what were relatively short haul routes. Thus in 1906, Chief Engineer G.J. Churchward took the basic design of his GWR 2800 Class, and adapted it. After proposing a 2-8-2T design, Churchward developed the UK's first 2-8-0 Tank engine, through concerns that the longer frames required for a 2-8-2T would restrict operation in the South Wales Valleys.\n\nChurchward upgraded the power of the design, modifying the frames to hold a GWR standard No.4 boiler over the 2800 Class standard No.1. The flanges of the second and third driving wheels were made thinner, and the coupling rods between the third and fourth sets of driving wheels used spherical joints, all to create side play and hence flexibility in operations. The prototype No.4201 was out shipped from Swindon Works in 1910 under Lot No.142, with a straight back bunker capable of containing three tonnes of coal. In 14 months of testing, it easily proved itself capable of negotiating curves down to in radius.\n\nPut into production in 1912 under Lot No.187, the first locomotives were Nos. 4202 - 4221, which had both top feed boilers and curved upper bodies to their coal bunkers to provide 3.5 tonnes of coal carrying capacity. Working 1000+ ton coal trains through the South Wales Valleys, from coal mines to ports, the large boilers and restricted loading gauge resulted in narrow side tanks. Although passing numerous water stops along their routes, because of the class’s heavy water consumption and limited tank capacity, they were nicknamed \"Water Carts\". 105 4200s were built between 1910 and 1923.\n\nIn 1919, from Lot No.213 (4262 - 4285) onwards, the coal bunker was built six inches taller, increasing coal capacity to 4 tons. In 1921, having also run out of allocation numbers, the class received its first major upgrade. Increasing cylinder diameter from to increased tractive effort to 33,170 pounds, thus creating the distinctive later GWR 5205 Class.\n\nThe last batch of the 5205 Class produced pre-World War II were lot No.266 of 1930, producing No's 5275-5294. However, due to the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and a resultant down turn in coal exports to Europe, a number of the 4200 Class having been returned to Swindon for overhaul, had in fact been stored there. To increase their operational ability across the wider GWR network, Chief Engineer Charles Collett took the board-agreed decision to alter this batch in production to 2-8-2T by adding a bolt-on extension to the frames to accommodate a pair of rear trailing wheels, which took the coal capacity up to 6 tons and water tanks to 2500 gallons. This created the GWR 7200 Class 2-8-2T. Due to demands from the Operational Department for more of the 7200 Class, from the stored 4200 Class locomotives at Swindon, fourteen were rebuilt between 1937 and 1939 as 7200 Class locomotives. Although operationally banned from certain goods yards, most 7200's found work across the GWR system, mostly deployed on iron ore and stone trains from .\n\nIn later years many of the remaining 4200's were upgraded to 5205 specification with outside steam pipes, larger cylinders and in some cases curved frames at the front end.\n\nAll but one, No.4224, passed in the ownership of British Railways on Nationalisation. By the end of steam on the former GWR system, 18 were still working at the start of 1965, the last withdrawn being No.4268 in August 1965.\n\nFive have been preserved, with all rescued from Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales. Three of the five surviving members of the 4200 have run in preservation.\nIn the case of 4277 its name is historically inaccurate, i.e. it being applied in preservation.\n\nIn 2012, Hornby released models of the 4200 class in both original GWR green and BR black.\n"}

He was the first of four children (John, Eldora, Eddie), and had one older half-brother (Benjamin Sheppard). Born a slave in Kentucky, Andy Thompson was released by his master in 1862 and settled in Decatur County, Iowa. The elder Thompson put all his children through college with his earnings as a farmer on in Decatur County.\n\nThompson graduated from Iowa Business College in 1896 and the Drake University Law School in 1898. While still a student at Drake, he took over the newly founded \"Iowa State Bystander\" from original publisher William Coalson in 1896. He stayed in Des Moines for the rest of his life, and over the following years, he turned the newspaper into a successful enterprise by organizing aggressive subscription drives and threatened boycotts against businesses that refused to advertise in a black newspaper. During the First World War, Thompson dedicated entire issues of the \"Bystander\" to issues surrounding the Buffalo Soldier regiments stationed in Iowa's Camp Dodge. After Armistice, Thompson met many returning black veterans, including James B. Morris. Morris took over the \"Bystander\" in 1922.\n\nIn addition to his work in journalism, Thompson and his wife, Maud Watkins-Thompson, were active in Iowan society. He served as deputy county treasurer in Polk County, Iowa (dates unknown), as well as deputy clerk of the Iowa Historical building.

They speak the Korku language, which is a member of the Munda languages and is written using Devanagari. They are classified as a Scheduled Tribe by the Indian government.\n\nThe name ‘Korku’ is originated from two terms ‘Koro’ and ‘Ku’ whereas ‘Koro’ means person and ‘Ku’ means alive. Combinely, the two words ‘Koro and Ku’ are defined as the alive member. \nThe Korkus are a Munda tribe and live near a Dravidian-speaking tribe — the Gonds. The Korku people are initially believed to be a hunter-gatherer community who dwelt in the forests of the Satpura Range on both sides of the Tapti River.\n\nThe Korku tribe lives in small groups of huts made of grass and wood. Every household has elevated stage like structure in the front side of the house. This elevated stage is used as a storage space of farm produce such as cattle feed. They socially consume liquor made from the flowers of the Mahua tree which is prepared in almost all the houses. Predominantly, a rural-based community with 97% living in rural areas, Korkus are primarily cultivators.\n\nWhilst they share the love of the forests with the Gonds, they are also excellent agriculturists and Korkus in Bhainsdehi tahsil of Betul district of Madhya Pradesh have pioneered the cultivation of potato and coffee. In their traditional festivals of Hari and Jitori, they celebrate a month long planting campaign. In this way they combat malnutrition and environmental degradation.\n\nThe community is the home to a unique and distinct culture, possesses a rich heritage of age old traditional systems more pertinently in terms of indigenous knowledge, beliefs, customs and social system. Traditional representative body of the society known as ‘Korku Panchayat’ is found in many villages. Headed by a chief known as \"Patel\", other members in the Panchayat include \"Padihar\" (priest), \"Kotwar\" (Chaukidar) and ten to twelve older male members of the community known as Panch. It plays a decisive role during traditional occasions mainly in festivals, marriages and intra- and inter-village conflict resolutions. Known for poverty, hunger, malnutrition, mass-scale exploitation by moneylenders and traders, the community confronts with numerous socio-economic challenges in the day-to-day life partly due to the poor natural resource bases. Agriculture though the primary source of livelihoods for most of the community members, many of them earn their livelihoods seasonally employed as agricultural labourers.\n\n"}

They were from a number of backgrounds and socioeconomic areas and later moved to Amana, Iowa, when they became dissatisfied with the congestion of Erie County and the growth of Buffalo, New York.\n\nFrom the time of the Edict of Nantes in 1598 until 1685, France had permitted Calvinist Protestants, known as Huguenots, to practice their religion and exercise the full rights of citizens while still maintaining Catholicism as the state religion. However, in 1685, King Louis XIV of France issued the Edict of Fontainebleau which ordered that Huguenot church buildings and schools be closed, and sought to suppress the religion. The (\"Inspired\") were Huguenots in Southern France who radicalized following their suppression and begun an itinerant ministry preaching the end time was at hand with claims of prophetic inspiration. They spent the remainder of the 17th century traveling throughout the Netherlands and England as refugees, before many of them settled in the Pietist center of Halle.\n\nThe influenced three brothers surnamed Pott who lived in Halle until they were exiled and went to Hanau and Wetteravia east of Frankfurt in 1714. The Pott brothers were several of many Pietists who had come to the area to take advantage of the religious tolerance of the counts of Isenburg-Eisenberg. There, they gave what many understood as divinely-inspired ecstatic speeches in a trance-like state. They sometimes experienced uncontrollable jolting motions of their entire bodies while they were preaching, which was understood as verification that they were seized by a divine spirit. Their message was a call to repentance and awakening.\n\nMany were drawn to the Potts, and the group that gathered around them emerged as a distinct group in the late autumn of 1714. This group is known as the Inspirationalists. Soon, others began preaching in a similar style and experienced similar convulsions. Among these other early leaders were Eberhard Ludwig Gruber, Johann Friedrich Rock, and Ursula Meyer of Thun.\n\nEverywhere the Inspirés and Inspirationalists went, communities gathered around them. However, political freedom was very limited in this era, and the Inspirationalists were routinely banished and were unable to find a place in Europe they could permanently settle. Their religious practices, including avoidance of military service and refusal to take an oath, kept them in conflict with German authorities. Many of these communities were short-lived, and all the leaders continued to travel and were frequently banished by political rulers. Major centers of the Inspirationalists were successively at Himbach near Hanau until 1740, the castle of Gelnhausen until 1753, Lieblos, and then Herrnhaag until the 1820s. The second generation of leaders in the 18th century were Wilhelm Ludwig Kampf and Paul Giesebert Nagel.\n\nGruber stayed for a time with the community of Brethren in Schwarzenau. However, the Inspirationalists found Brethren to be legalistic, sectarian, and sterile in contrast to their own charismatic and prophetic missionary zeal. Ursula Meyer twice prophesied that Brethren leader Alexander Mack was to meet an early death so that he would not continue to burden his co-religionists. She similarly disapproved of Anabaptist Andreas Boni. The groups ended up competing, and poor relations likely spurred the Brethren to leave Schwarzenau for the Netherlands in 1720.\n\nTheir religion continued to grow until Gruber and Rock's deaths, but subsequently declined until a reawakening sparked by Michael Krausert, who preached for a revival and had much support.\n\nIn the 1840s, renewed religious restrictions and requirements from political rulers prompted the Inspirationalists to migrate as a group to North America. Their first settlements were near Buffalo on both sides of the Niagara River. Sites included West Seneca and the Town of Elma. They immediately began practicing community of goods, working in textiles and agriculture. This settlement became known as the Ebenezer Colonies They were soon dismayed to find the area crowded, with the urban presence of growing Buffalo too close and conflicts with the Seneca Indians arising. In 1854, many of the Inspirationists moved to the Iowa River Valley to found the Amana Colonies.\n\nOfficial membership was 1,534 in 1925, and was more than a thousand as late as the 1980s.\n\nThe Community of True Inspiration Residence was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Congenital heart diseases involving only the primary arteries (pulmonary artery and aorta) belong to a sub-group called transposition of the great arteries.\n\nTransposed vessels can present a large variety of atriovenous, ventriculoarterial and/or arteriovenous discordance. The effects may range from a change in blood pressure to an interruption in circulation, depending on the nature and degree of the misplacement and which vessels are involved.\n\nAlthough \"transposed\" literally means \"swapped\", many types of TGV involve vessels that are in abnormal positions, while not actually being swapped with each other. The terms TGV and TGA are most commonly used in reference to dextro-TGA – in which the arteries \"are\" in swapped positions; however, both terms are also commonly used, though to a slightly lesser extent, in reference to levo-TGA – in which both the arteries and the ventricles are swapped; while other defects in this category are almost never referred to by either of these terms.\n\nIn dextro-Transposition of the great arteries (dextro-TGA) deoxygenated blood from the right heart is pumped immediately through the aorta and circulated to the body and the heart itself, bypassing the lungs altogether, while the left heart pumps oxygenated blood continuously back into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. In effect, two separate \"circular\" (parallel) circulatory systems are created. It is called a cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD) because the newborn infant turns blue from lack of oxygen.\n\nLevo-Transposition of the great arteries is an acyanotic heart defect in which the primary arteries are transposed, with the aorta anterior and to the left of the pulmonary artery, and the morphological left and right ventricles with their corresponding atrioventricular valves are also transposed. The systemic and the pulmonary circulation are connected. Complications arise from the fact that the right ventricle, which is adapted for pumping blood into the low-pressure pulmonary circulation, is being tasked with pumping blood at a much higher pressure against the high resistance of the systemic circulation.\n\nIn many cases, TGV is accompanied by other heart defects, the most common type being intracardiac shunts such as atrial septal defect including patent foramen ovale, ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. Stenosis, or other defects, of valves and/or vessels may also be present.\n\nWhen no other heart defects are present it is called 'simple' TGV; when other defects are present it is called 'complex' TGV.\n\nPreexisting diabetes mellitus of a pregnant mother is a risk factor that has been described for the fetus having TGV. \nOn chest X-ray, transposition of the great vessels typically shows a cardio-mediastinal silhouette appearing as an \"\"egg on a string\"\", wherein in which the enlarged heart represents an egg on its side and the narrowed, atrophic thymus of the superior mediastinum represents the string.\n\nFor newborns with transposition, prostaglandins can be given to keep the ductus arteriosus open which allows mixing of the otherwise isolated pulmonary and systemic circuits. Thus oxygenated blood that recirculates back to the lungs can mix with blood that circulates throughout the body. The arterial switch operation is the definitive treatment for dextro-transposition. Rarely the arterial switch is not feasible due to particular coronary artery anatomy and an atrial switch operation is preferred.\n\nTGV was first described in 1797 by Matthew Baillie.\n\n"}
{"id": "2062102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062102", "title": "Argentine debt restructuring", "text": "Argentine debt restructuring\n\nThe Argentine debt restructuring is a process of debt restructuring by Argentina that began on January 14, 2005, and allowed it to resume payment on 76% of the US$82 billion in sovereign bonds that defaulted in 2001 at the depth of the worst economic crisis in the nation's history. A second debt restructuring in 2010 brought the percentage of bonds under some form of repayment to 93%, though ongoing disputes with holdouts remained. Bondholders who participated in the restructuring settled for repayments of around 30% of face value and deferred payment terms, and began to be paid punctually; the value of their nearly worthless bonds also began to rise. The remaining 7% of bondholders later won the right to be repaid in full.\n\nAs part of the restructuring process, Argentina drafted agreements in which repayments would be handled through a New York corporation and governed by United States law. The holdout bondholders found themselves unable to seize Argentine sovereign assets in settlement, but realized that Argentina had omitted to provide for holdout situations and had instead deemed all bonds repayable on (equal) terms that prevented preferential treatment among bondholders. The holdout bondholders therefore sought, and won, an injunction in 2012 that prohibited Argentina from repaying the 93% of bonds that had been renegotiated, unless they simultaneously paid the 7% holdouts their full amount due as well. Together with the agreement's rights upon future offers (\"RUFO\") clause, this created a deadlock in which the 93% of renegotiated bondholders could not be paid without paying the 7% holdouts, but any payment to the holdouts would potentially (according to Argentina) trigger the 93% being due repayment at full value too; a sum of around $100 billion that Argentina could not afford. The courts ruled that as Argentina had itself drafted the agreement, and chosen the terms it wished to propose, it could not now claim the terms were unreasonable or unfair, and that this could not be worked around by asserting sovereign status since the injunction did not affect sovereign assets, but simply ruled that Argentina must not give preferential treatment of any group of bondholders over any other group when making repayments.\n\nSubsequently, though Argentina wanted to repay some creditors, the judgment prevented Argentina from doing so, because being forced to repay all creditors, including the holdouts, would have totaled around $100 billion. The country was therefore categorized as being in selective default by Standard & Poor's and in restricted default by Fitch. The ruling affected New York law Argentine bonds; Argentine bonds issued under Buenos Aires and European law were not affected.\n\nProposed solutions include seeking waivers of the RUFO clause from bondholders, or waiting for the RUFO clause to expire at the end of 2014. The dilemma raised concerns internationally about the ability of a small minority to forestall an otherwise-agreed debt restructuring of an insolvent country, and the ruling that led to it was criticized.\n\nAlthough the media widely reported that the default ended with payments to the principal bondholders in early 2016, during the presidency of Mauricio Macri, several hundred million dollars in outstanding defaulted bonds remained unpaid, which resulted in continuation of litigation. In November 2016 Argentina announced that it had settled with additional creditors for US$475 million.\n\nAround 1998 to 2002, Argentina's economy went into severe recession. On December 26, 2001, Argentina defaulted on a total of US$93 billion of its external debt; of around $81.8 billion in bonds that were defaulted, 51% were issued during this three-year period. Foreign investment fled the country, and capital flow toward Argentina ceased almost completely from 2001 to 2003 (though it later recovered). The currency exchange rate (formerly a fixed 1-to-1 parity between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar) was floated, and the peso devalued quickly to nearly 4-to-1, producing a sudden rise in inflation to over 40% and a fall in real GDP of 11% in 2002.\n\nLarge-scale debt restructuring was needed urgently, since the high-interest bonds had become unpayable. The Argentine government met severe challenges trying to refinance its debt, however. Creditors (many of them private citizens in Spain, Italy, Germany, Japan, the United States, and other countries, who had invested their savings and retirement pensions in debt bonds) denounced the default; this included bondholders from Argentina itself, estimated to compose about a fourth of affected bondholders.\n\nEconomic recovery eventually allowed Argentina to offer large-scale debt swaps in 2005 and 2010; the first brought 76% of bonds out of default and the second, 91.3%. The terms of the debt exchanges were not accepted by all private bondholders; the holders of around 7% of the defaulted bonds - known as \"holdouts\" - continued to seek full repayment. The IMF initially lobbied for the holdouts until Argentina's lump-sum repayment to the IMF in January 2006. Individual creditors worldwide, who represented about one third of this group, mobilized to seek repayment following the default. Among the most prominent were Task Force Argentina, an Italian retail bondholder association; and Mark Botsford, a private U.S. retail bondholder; and Kenneth Dart, who unsuccessfully sued in 2003 to be paid $724 million for bonds purchased in 2001 for $120 million. Dart renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1994 for tax avoidance purposes, and his interests in Argentina became the focus of tax evasion charges in 2013. Italian nationals had become the largest group of foreign retail investors in Argentine bonds when during the 1990s, banks in their country purchased $14 billion in bonds and then resold them to nearly half a million investors; the vast majority rejected the first swap but accepted the second.\n\nUpon default, Argentina's bondholders sued to be repaid 100% of their bonds' face value. Among the bondholders were vulture funds, who had speculatively acquired US$1.3 billion of the bonds' total value on the secondary market for cents on the dollar after the 2001 default. Vulture funds also owned a large quantity of credit default swaps (CDS) against Argentine bonds. This created a further incentive to not only trigger a default against Argentina; but also to undermine the value of the bonds themselves, as the CDS would pay out at a higher rate if the defaulted bonds decline to extremely low values.\n\nThe vulture funds held out for payment in full via litigation (hence their common description as \"holdout\" bondholders, or \"holdouts\"). Their legal tactics included seeking injunctions to attach future payments to other bondholders by way of forcing Argentina to settle. A similar strategy had been successfully pursued previously by vulture funds against Peru and a number of African nations, as well as against corporations in the United States itself, such as Delphi Automotive, which was forced to pay Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corporation a return of over 3,000% on corporate bonds defaulted during the 2008 recession. NML Capital Limited, the Cayman Islands-based principal vulture funds in this dispute, is also owned by Singer. NML paid $49 million in the secondary market for bonds worth $832 million by 2014. Its lobbying group, American Task Force Argentina, is the most prominent and best financed opponent of Argentine bond restructuring efforts, spending over $7 million lobbying U.S. Congressmen and becoming the top campaign contributor to a number of these; the most prominent, former Western Hemisphere Subcommittee Chair Connie Mack IV (R-FL), became the main sponsor of a bill in 2012 designed to force Argentina to pay NML nearly $2 billion before losing his Senate bid that year. Their lobbying campaign also extends to Argentina, where NML Capital finances an NGO led by Laura Alonso, a Congresswoman affiliated with the right-wing PRO party.\n\nIn August 2013, the Government of Argentina lost a U.S. appeals court case and was told it had to repay the full face value amount to these holdouts. Courts in Europe have backed Argentina on the basis of the equal terms clause, however. A third debt restructuring offer to remaining holdouts on similar terms to the 2010 swap was announced on August 27, 2013. However, meeting vulture funds' full face-value demands is problematic for Argentina, because although bonds held by vulture funds are a small share of the total (1.6%), such a settlement would lead to lawsuits from other bondholders demanding to be paid on similar terms under the agreement's \"rights upon future offers\" (RUFO) clause, effectively unwinding the settlement by allowing all bondholders payment in full, and creating an unaffordable liability of up to $120 billion more than at present.\n\nAs a result, Argentina has still not been able to raise finance on the international debt markets for fear that any money raised would be impounded by holdout lawsuits; their country risk borrowing cost premiums remain over 10%, much higher than comparable countries. Consequently, Argentina has been paying debt from central bank reserves, has banned most retail purchases of dollars, limited imports, and ordered companies to repatriate money held abroad. Nevertheless, between 2003 and 2012 Argentina met debt service payments totaling $173.7 billion, of which 81.5 billion was collected by bondholders, 51.2 billion by multilateral lenders such as the IMF and World Bank, and 41 billion by Argentine government agencies. Public external debt denominated in foreign currencies (mainly in dollars and euros) accordingly fell from 150% of GDP in 2002 to 8.3% in 2013.\n\nIn 2001, Argentina defaulted on its foreign debt.\nIn January 2005, the Argentine government offered the first debt restructuring to affected bondholders; nearly 76% of the defaulted bonds (US$62.5 billion) were thus exchanged and brought out of default. The exchange offered longer term par, quasi-par, and discount bonds - the latter with a much lower nominal value (25–35% of the original). The majority of the Argentine bond market thereafter became based on GDP-linked bonds, and investors, both foreign and domestic, netted record yields amid renewed growth. One of the largest single investors in Argentine bonds following these developments was Venezuela, which bought a total of more than $5 billion in restructured Argentine bonds from 2005 to 2007. Between 2001-2006, Venezuela was the largest single buyer of Argentina's debt.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Banco Occidental de Descuento and Fondo Común, owned by Venezuelan bankers Victor Vargas Irausquin and Victor Gill Ramirez respectively, bought most of Argentina's outstanding bonds and resold them on to the market. The banks bought $100 million worth of Argentine bonds and resold the bonds for a profit of approximately $17 million. People who criticize Vargas have said that he made a $1 billion \"backroom deal\" with swaps of Argentine bonds as a sign of his friendship with Chavez. The \"Financial Times\" interviewed financial analysts in the United States who said that the banks profited from the resale of the bonds; the Venezuelan government did not profit.\n\nBondholders who had accepted the 2005 swap (three out of four did so) saw the value of their bonds rise 90% by 2012, and these continued to rise strongly during 2013.\n\nDuring the restructuring process, the International Monetary Fund was considered a \"privileged creditor\", that is, all debt was recognized and paid in full. During 2005 Argentina shifted from a policy of constant negotiation and refinancing with the IMF to payment in full, taking advantage of a large and growing fiscal surplus due to rising commodity prices and economic output, with the acknowledged intention of gaining financial independence from the IMF.\n\nPresident Néstor Kirchner on December 15, 2005, announced his intention of liquidating all the remaining debt to the IMF, in a single payment of US$9.81 billion, initially planned to take place before the end of the year (a similar move had been announced by Brazil two days before, and it is understood that the two measures were to be coordinated).\n\nArgentina under the Kirchner administration had already reduced its debt to the IMF from $15.5 billion in 2003 to $10.5 billion at the time of this announcement. The last and largest remaining share of the IMF debt, about $9.5 billion, was paid on January 3, 2006. The debt was in fact denominated in special drawing rights (SDR; a unit employed by the IMF and calculated over a basket of currencies). The Argentine Central Bank called on the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, where a part of its currency reserves were deposited, to act as its agent. The BIS bought 3.78 billion SDR (equivalent to about $5.4 billion) from 16 central banks and ordered their transfer to the IMF. The rest (2.874 billion SDR or $4.1 billion) was transferred from Argentina's account in the IMF, deposited in the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nThe payment served to cancel the debt installments that were to be paid in 2006 ($5.1 billion), 2007 ($4.6 billion), and 2008 ($432 million). This disbursement represented 8.8% of the total Argentine public debt and decreased the Central Bank's reserves by one third (from $28 billion to $18.6 billion). According to the official announcement, it also saved about a billion dollars in interest, though the actual savings amounted to $842 million (since the reserves that were in the BIS were until then receiving interest payments). One of the largest single investors in Argentine bonds following these Venezuela bought a total of more than $5 billion in restructured Argentine bonds from 2005 to 2007.\n\nThe initial announcement was made in a surprise press conference. President Kirchner said that, with this payment, \"we bury an ignominious past of eternal, infinite indebtment.\" Many of those present later called the decision \"historic\". The head of the IMF, Rodrigo Rato, saluted it, though remarking that Argentina \"faces important challenges ahead\". United States Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snow said that this move \"shows good faith\" on the part of the Argentine government. Nobel Economics Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz repeatedly criticized the IMF and supported the Argentine strategies on the debt restructuring, but opposed the disindebtment policy, suggesting instead that the IMF should receive the same treatment as the other creditors. Local criticism of the IMF debt paydown centered around the cost, which made funds unavailable for productive purposes within Argentina or to come to terms with outstanding creditors; and second, that the government traded cheap IMF credits for new emissions of public debt at much higher interest rates. Following the initial surprise and mixed reactions local markets rallied, with the MERVAL index growing more in January 2006 than in all of 2005.\n\nThe Ministry of Economy reported in June 2005 that the total official Argentine public debt was down by $63.5 billion from the first semester to $126.5 billion as a result of the restructuring process; of this, 46% was denominated in dollars, 36% in pesos, and 11% in euros and other currencies. Due to the full payment of the IMF debt and several other adjustments, as of January 2006 the total figure decreased further to $124.3 billion; bonds not exchanged in 2005 accounted for $23.4 billion, of which 12.7 billion were already overdue. The Central Bank's reserves surpassed their pre-payment levels on September 27, 2006.\n\nA similar agreement was reached eight years later with the Paris Club of creditor nations (the last remaining Argentine debt still in default besides bonds held by holdouts) on debt repayment totaling $9 billion including penalties and interest.\n\nOn April 15, 2010, the debt exchange was re-opened to bondholders who rejected the 2005 swap; 67% of these latter accepted the swap, leaving 7% as holdouts. Holdouts continued to put pressure on the government by attempting to seize Argentine assets abroad, and by suing to attach future Argentine payments on restructured debt to receive better treatment than cooperating creditors.\n\nA total of approximately US$12.86 billion of eligible debt was tendered into the exchange launched in April 2010; this represented 69.5% of outstanding bonds still held by holdouts. A total of 152 types of bonds in seven different currencies under eight distinct jurisdictions were issued during the two debt exchanges. The 2010 re-opening thus brought the total amount of debt restructured to 92.6% (the original 2005 debt exchange restructured 76.2% of Argentine government debt in default since 2001). The final settlement of the 2010 debt exchange took place on August 11, for bondholders that didn't participate in the early tranche that closed on May 14 and settled on May 17.\n\nAlthough around 93% of bondholders accepted reduced repayments (typically being repaid only 30% of the face value of bonds), a minority owning around 7% of the debt (US$4 billion), mostly hedge funds and vulture funds, continued to argue in court that they were due repayment in full, and held out for full repayment, eventually winning their case.\n\nNML Capital Limited, a Cayman Islands-based offshore unit of Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corporation, purchased many holdings in 2008, paying an estimated $49 million for one series of bonds whose face value was over $220 million; with the subsequent boom in Argentine bond values, this face value grew to $832 million by 2014. They in turn established the American Task Force Argentina lobbying group against Argentine bond restructuring efforts, and sued to enjoin Argentina's ongoing payments to the bondholders who had participated in the earlier restructurings.\n\nDuring the 2000s NML Capital's lawyers initially obtained several large judgments against Argentina, all of which were affirmed on appeal. These rulings found that the holdout bondholders in the case were entitled to be repaid the full face value of the bonds they held, rather than alternative amounts such as the reduced settlements negotiated in 2005 and 2010, or the amounts they had purchased the bonds for.\n\nAfter defaulting, Argentina continued to pay its renegotiated bondholders, but not the holdout bondholders who had rejected settlement. As Argentina refused to pay the holdout creditors at full value, the holdouts initially resorted to lawsuits to seize Argentine government assets abroad – notably Central Bank deposits in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the presidential airplane, and the . The \"Libertad\", an Argentine Navy training frigate, was arrested (though not seized) at the behest of NML Capital for ten weeks in late 2012 in the port of Tema, Ghana, until the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled unanimously that it be released. Eventually this approach proved fruitless. The holdout bondholders soon discovered that due to a number of sovereign immunity laws, it was impossible to actually enforce their judgments by seizing the handful of Argentine assets still within the reach of U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed by NML, the lower UK courts found that Argentina had state immunity. Before 2011, Elliott successfully appealed the case to the UK Supreme Court, which ruled that Elliott had the right to attempt to seize Argentine property in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe basis of the holdout bondholders' next approach arose from oversights on Argentina's part, due to both its economic history and partly from the legal wording chosen by the Argentina's government.\n\nBecause Argentina had been historically so unstable, it would have been difficult for it to solicit investors to buy bonds in Buenos Aires under Argentine jurisdiction, as few external investors trusted Argentina courts to enforce bonds against their own government. This consideration led Argentina to transfer the issue of bonds to New York, under United States law, on April 20, 1976, as were most subsequent bond issues. The bonds were therefore issued under a special kind of bond contract, a \"Fiscal Agency Agreement\" that was drafted by Argentina's U.S. attorneys under the law of the state of New York. The FAA stipulated that the repayments on the bonds were to be made by Argentina through a trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon, which meant that the U.S. courts did have jurisdiction over that party to issue injunctive relief.\n\nIn the Fiscal Agency Agreement, Argentina's attorneys included a boilerplate \"pari passu\" clause, but neglected to include a collective action clause. \"Pari passu\" is a term generally used to signify equal priority or treatment, and a collective action clause would have obligated any holdouts to accept the generally offered terms if enough other bondholders agreed to accept them. As a result, the holdouts realized that while Argentina could not force the holdouts to accept the terms in the 2005 or 2010 restructurings, NML could use the \"pari passu\" clause to force Argentina to choose between paying all its bondholders (including NML) or none of them.\n\nNML Capital therefore sued Argentina in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (i.e., a federal trial court) by invoking that court's diversity jurisdiction as well as forum selection and choice of law clauses in the Fiscal Agency Agreement itself.\n\nFederal district judge Thomas P. Griesa was assigned to hear the case. The crucial expression \"pari passu\" had not previously been interpreted in any published decision by the courts of the state of New York, but there is no way in U.S. federal civil procedure for a federal district court to \"directly\" transfer a case to state court if it had not originally started there. (By way of contrast, if NML Capital had sued Argentina in a New York state court, Argentina would have had the option to \"remove\" the case to federal court.) Instead, the district court was required by \"Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins\" (1938) to make an \"Erie guess\" as to how a New York state trial court would interpret that clause by applying general principles of contract law in the state of New York as articulated in the published decisions of the New York Court of Appeals and the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division. The district court ruled in NML Capital's favor and issued broad permanent injunctions against Argentina and the bond trustee. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the federal appellate court with jurisdiction over New York) in turn affirmed the district court's interpretation, but did not exercise its optional right to certify that specific issue to the New York Court of Appeals for a ruling on New York state law.\n\nAccording to the Second Circuit's opinion issued on October 26, 2012 (signed by senior circuit judge Barrington Daniels Parker, Jr.), Paragraph 1(c) of the 1994 version of Argentina's Fiscal Agency Agreement was as follows:\n\nThe Second Circuit interpreted this clause under New York law and concluded \"that in pairing the two sentences of its Pari Passu Clause, the FAA manifested an intention to protect bondholders from more than just formal subordination ... the two sentences ... protect against different forms of discrimination: the issuance of other superior debt (first sentence) and the giving of priority to other payment obligations (second sentence).\" Argentina had argued the entire clause was intended to protect only against the \"first\" type of discrimination; the Second Circuit held that Argentina's approach was invalid because it ignored the critical differences in wording between the two sentences, treated the second sentence as redundant, and in turn violated New York's rule that \"a contract should not be interpreted in such a way as would leave one of its provisions substantially without force or effect.\" Thus, the Second Circuit affirmed the trial court's decision that Argentina could either pay \"all\" its bondholders or \"none\", but could not pay only those who cooperated with the 2005 and 2010 restructurings and ignore the rest.\n\nThus in 2012 (affirmed on appeal 2013), the courts ruled that paying the settled bondholders but not the holdouts was a breach of Argentina's agreement and discriminated against the holdout bondholders.\n\nFurthermore, the Second Circuit held that the trial court's injunctions did not violate Argentina's sovereign immunity because they merely enforced the prohibition against both formal and informal \"subordination\" of any part of the debt to any other debt: \"They do not attach, arrest, or execute upon any property ... the Injunctions do not require Argentina to pay any bondholder any amount of money; nor do they limit the other uses to which Argentina may put its fiscal reserves. In other words, the Injunctions do not transfer any dominion or control over sovereign property to the court.\"\n\nAs of February 2013, after further decisions by the district court, the case came again before the Second Circuit. The decision of the appeals court was adverse and a motion for rehearing by a full panel was denied on March 26.\n\nOn August 23, 2013, the Second Circuit (in another opinion also signed by Judge Parker) affirmed the lower court's latest ruling clarifying the scope of the permanent injunctions. The court implied at the start of its opinion that since Argentina had taken a calculated risk to enjoy the benefit of New York law (i.e., a lower interest rate), it now had to bear the burden of New York law as well: \"In order to enhance the marketability of the bonds, Argentina made a series of promises to the purchasers.\" Among those promises in the 1994 Fiscal Agency Agreement were the \"pari passu\" clause, the aforementioned forum selection and choice-of-law clauses expressly referencing New York, as well as a promise of the free transferability of the bonds to any transferee, regardless of whether that transferee was a \"university endowment, a so-called 'vulture fund,' or a widow or an orphan.\" In other words, as the drafter of the Fiscal Agency Agreement, Argentina could have easily avoided the situation it found itself in by writing a different \"pari passu\" clause, omitting the transferability clause, including anti-assignment clauses (e.g., a clause providing that assignees could only recover the amount actually paid rather than face value of the debt), or writing the contract under the law of a different jurisdiction altogether, with the understanding that rational investors would have demanded higher interest rates in exchange for any of these things.\n\nAfter refuting all of Argentina's arguments on the merits, the Second Circuit concluded: \"We do not believe the outcome of this case threatens to steer bond issuers away from the New York marketplace ... We believe that the interest — one widely shared in the financial community — in maintaining New York's status as one of the foremost commercial centers is advanced by requiring debtors, including foreign debtors, to pay their debts.\"\n\nNotably, when it came to looking at big-picture public policy issues, both Second Circuit opinions examined them only through the lens of federal procedural law (i.e., whether the injunctions were an inequitable remedy) as opposed to the substantive rules of New York state contractual law. Although New York recognizes several defenses to the enforceability of a contract like unconscionability, those defenses are usually available only to the weaker party at the time of contract formation, the party who did \"not\" write the contract (i.e., the bondholders), which explains why they were not discussed in the Second Circuit's opinions. If those defenses are unavailable (for example, because the party resisting enforcement was the one who wrote the contract), New York courts will mechanically enforce the plain language of a contract regardless of its harshness because \"a court is not free to alter the contract to reflect its personal notions of fairness and equity.\"\n\nThe United States Supreme Court repeatedly denied Argentina's petitions for certiorari, on October 7, 2013 and June 16, 2014, meaning that it was effectively refusing to hear Argentina's appeals from the Second Circuit's decisions. The petition denied on June 16 had presented two issues: (1) sovereign immunity and (2) the Second Circuit's decision to simply affirm the trial court's \"Erie\" guess as opposed to exercising the option to certify that issue to the New York Court of Appeals.\n\nOn the same day it denied to review the injunction, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed Judge Griesa's worldwide discovery order in \"Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd.\"\n\nCitigroup, which has operations in both New York and in Argentina, was caught in the middle, being required to conform to both New York and Argentine law, an international conflict of law. The trial court has granted temporary relief to the bank, allow payment of a few of the interest payments due to holdout bondholders, but the obligation to repay all holdouts as the cost of continuing to service Argentine bonds had resulted in a decision to terminate its Argentine debt servicing operation absent legal relief.\n\nThe \"Pari passu\" ruling had a grave impact on Argentina's route out of economic difficulty. The issue perceived by Argentina was that the agreement also included a \"rights upon future offers\" (\"RUFO\") clause. The effect of such a clause was that, if a later settlement paid more, or on better terms, all existing settlements would be repaid on the improved terms. This was intended to reassure bondholders that it was safe to settle early, and reduce the incentive to hold out for a better later offer.\n\nAs a result of the earlier rulings for the holdout bondholders, Argentina now faced a situation whereby:\n\nThe U.S. judicial \"pari passu\" ruling therefore forced Argentina to miss the scheduled bond payments being managed from New York, as from July 30, 2014 (bonds issued under Argentine law (paid through Citibank Argentina) and bonds issued under European Law (paid through Euroclear and Clearstream), were not affected.). This in turn caused Argentina to be declared in selective default by Standard & Poor's and in restricted default by Fitch, meaning that some Argentine bondholders were receiving payment while others now weren't.\n\nPresident Cristina Fernández de Kirchner stated after the latter denial of certiorari that her country had an obligation to pay its creditors, but not to become the victims of extortion by speculators; even if Argentina can't use the U.S. financial system to do so, she said, teams of experts are working on ways to avoid such a default and keep Argentina's promises. The expiration of Rights Upon Future Offers (RUFO) in December 2014 will preclude other bondholders from suing for better terms should the Argentine Government and the vulture funds settle, making such a settlement all the more likely after that date should the dispute continue.\n\nIn August 2014, Argentina filed a case at the International Court of Justice, alleging that through its court system's decision, the United States had \"violat[ed] its sovereign immunity\" and breached \"[the] obligation not to use or encourage measures of economic and political action to force the sovereign will of another State\", and was responsible for permitting judicial malpractice and gross incompetence in allowing two small hedge funds to trigger a needless default against most other bondholders. Information was likewise requested from the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the possibility of securities fraud involving the bonds by plaintiffs in the case. Observers note that the United States must consent to the case being heard, which has only happened 22 times in the ICJ's 68 years of existence, and a Latin American and international law specialist at Oxford Analytica observed to media that, \"From the point of view of the U.S. government, the New York court system has dealt with a contractual dispute in which the executive [branch] cannot intervene. It's a dispute governed by a contract, not by a treaty or international law\".\n\nThe decision was likewise rejected by the Organization of American States, the G-77 (133 nations), and the Council on Foreign Relations, as well as by bondholders whose payments were stopped by the Griesa court.\n\nLarge banks, investors, and the U.S. Treasury Department objected to the federal courts' decisions and expressed concern over losses that could be incurred by bondholders and others, as well over disruption in the bond markets. Vladimir Werning, executive director for Latin American research at JPMorgan Chase, observed that vulture funds \"are trying to block the payments system\" in the United States itself, something \"unprecedented in the New York jurisdiction.\" Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, which handles Argentina's international bond payments, said the ruling \"will create unrest in the credit markets and result in cascades of litigation, which is precisely the opposite effect that an injunction should have.\" The American Bankers Association agreed, noting that \"permitting injunctions that preclude pre-existing obligations whenever expedient to enforce a judgment against the debtor will have significantly adverse consequences for the financial system.\"\n\nA consortium of Argentine banks, led by Argentine Banking Association (Adeba) President Jorge Brito, meanwhile presented their own settlement offer on July 30, by which all vulture fund bond holdings in dispute would be purchased in installments for a total of US$1.4 billion, but the offer was refused; Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, and HSBC joined efforts to repurchase vulture fund holdings on August 1. The ISDA, of which Singer's Elliott hedge fund is one of 15 bank members, granted Singer and fellow vulture fund plaintiff Aurelius Capital CDS insurance payout of $1 billion on August 1.\n\nThe dispute limited Argentina's access to foreign credit markets as well; in October 2012 Argentina's theoretical borrowing costs were 10.7%, double the average for developing countries. Although Argentina has not raised money on the money markets since the default, the state-owned oil company YPF has already placed debt in the financial markets to finance its investment program in years to come.\n\nThe possibility that holdout creditors can attach future payments on restructured debt and receive better treatment than cooperating creditors distorts incentives, can derail efforts for a cooperative restructuring, and may ultimately lead to the United States no longer being viewed as a safe place to issue sovereign debt.\n\nThe Second Circuit has acknowledged that New York Judiciary Law Section 489 (descended from an 1813 statute) appears to facially prohibit \"essentially all 'secondary' transactions in debt instruments where the purchaser had an intent to enforce the debt obligation through litigation,\" but then ruled in a 1999 decision involving Elliott Management's earlier case against Peru that the history of that section as interpreted in New York state courts revealed that it was intended only to prohibit purchases made with the \"sole\" intent of bringing a lawsuit \"in and of itself\". That is, the New York Legislature was trying to stop attorneys or debt collectors from exploiting cost-shifting clauses in worthless promissory notes to obtain judgments for minuscule amounts (i.e., the face value of the notes) that also awarded massive costs incurred in the course of litigation. Section 489 does not apply to purchases made with the primary intent of collecting on the face value of the instrument, where litigation is merely a means to that end. The United Kingdom, however, restricted the use of its courts for suits by vulture funds against developing countries in 2011. As of 2014 70% of the world's sovereign bonds are issued in New York, and 22% in London.\n\nAccording to \"Reuters\" in 2013, the case is likely to be of particular importance in cases in which the creditors are being asked to accept substantial debt and debt service reduction, though it is unclear given the special circumstances of the Elliot/NML case whether it will be broadly applicable to holdouts in other restructurings. The American Bankers Association warned that the district court's interpretation of the equal terms provision could enable a single creditor to thwart the implementation of an internationally supported restructuring plan, and thereby undermine the decades of effort the United States has expended to encourage a system of cooperative resolution of sovereign debt crises.\n\nMauricio Macri was elected president of Argentina in November 2015. He sought to negotiate with the holdouts and end the default, in order to return to the international capital markets and benefit the national economy. In early 2016, US courts ruled that Argentina must make full payments to four \"holdout bondholders\" (NML, Aurelius Capital Management, Davidson Kempner Capital Management, and Bracebridge Capital) by February 29. Argentina made an offer to pay $6.5 billion to settle lawsuits on February 5, requesting that the prior ruling on payments be lifted. Daniel Pollack announced in February 2016 that Argentina had reached an agreement with Paul Singer. The deal would still need to be ratified by the Argentine Congress. The deal would only last until April 14, 2016.\n\nAlthough \"Cambiemos\", Macri's political coalition, did not have a majority at either house of the Congress, the bill was approved by both of them in March. Many Peronist legislators supported it because the province governors would also benefit from access to international credit markets. With the bill approved, Argentina faced a court hearing in New York on April 13. The court confirmed the ruling of Griesa, and allowed Argentina to pay to the bondholders of 2005, 2010 and those that were still in default. The payment will be done with a bond sale. This appeared to the media to be the end of the Argentine default, which had started in 2001.\n\nHowever, nearly US$1 billion in defaulted bonds remained unpaid, which resulted in continuing though less publicised litigation. Argentina finally reported in November 2016 that it had reached agreements to pay US$475 million to settle the outstanding defaulted debt. In January 2017, \"The Economist\" reported that the MSCI index would be considering re-accepting Argentina’s shares over 2017, and on January 5, JPMorgan Chase also said it would admit Argentina into its benchmark indices early in the year. On March 6, 2017, \"Barron's\" reported that Moody’s Investors Services had “raised its outlook on Argentina’s credit rating to positive from stable.”\n\n\n\n"}

Together with the Torres Islands to the northwest, they make up the northernmost province of Torba. The group lies about north of Maewo, and includes Gaua and Vanua Lava, two of the 13 largest islands in Vanuatu. In 2009, the islands supported a population of 8,533 on a land area of 780 km².\n\nThe largest island is Gaua (formerly called Santa Maria), which has a rugged terrain, rising to Mount Gharat, an active volcano at the centre of the island, at . The freshwater Lake Letas in the crater is the largest lake in Vanuatu. \nThe slightly smaller Vanua Lava, is higher at ; it also has an active volcano at Mount Suretamate (also spelled Süretimiat or Sere'ama, ). To its east are two islets, Ravenga and Kwakea (or Qakea). Sola, the provincial capital, is on this island. The third largest island, Ureparapara (also known as Parapara), is an old volcanic cone that has been breached by the sea, forming Divers Bay on its east coast.\n\nTo the east of these larger islands lie a number of smaller ones. The furthest north, northeast of Ureparapara, is Vet Tagde (Vot Tande or Vot Ganai), an extinct volcano that last erupted 3.5 million years ago. The Rowa Islands (or Reef Islands) are a few very small, low islands on a coral atoll. Mota Lava is the largest and highest (411 m) of this eastern chain of islands; off its southern coast, attached by high corals that one can wade through at low tide, is the tiny islet of Ra. Mota, Merig and Merelava complete the southeastern part of the archipelago.\n\nThe population of the Banks Islands speak fifteen different languages. Several are endangered, being spoken by no more than a few hundred, and sometimes just a handful of last speakers.\n\nAll these languages belong to the Oceanic subgroup of the Austronesian family.\n\nThe principal economic activity is subsistence agriculture, though copra, coffee and (on Gaua) cacao are grown for export. The sulphur deposits of Mount Suretamate on Vanua Lava were formerly worked by a French company. Tourism is increasingly important, on the islands with easy transport by airplane.\n\nThe Banks Islands were the first part of Vanuatu discovered by a European explorer, from the 25 to 29 April 1606 when a Spanish expedition led by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernández de Quirós sailed past Merelava and stopped at Gaua, before landing on Espiritu Santo and establishing a short-lived colony there. Merelava was charted as \"San Marcos\", Mota Lava as \"Lágrimas de San Pedro\" (St. Peter’s tears), Vanua Lava as \"Portal de Belén\" (Stable at Bethlehem), and Gaua as \"Santa María\".\nThey were later overlooked in 1774 when Captain James Cook explored Vanuatu and believed he saw the whole chain. They were first explored by William Bligh of the British Navy, and named after his patron Sir Joseph Banks. They were charted by Matthew Flinders. Vanua Lava was first explored by the New Zealand Bishop George Augustus Selwyn in 1859.\n\nThere are airports on Mota Lava, Vanua Lava and Gaua, which have a few flights a week with Air Vanuatu.

His family originated in Poland and have lived in Wigan since World War II.\n\nRadlinski signed for his hometown club in 1993, aged 17, and went on to play his entire professional career for them after having played for Wigan St Judes and Wigan St Patricks at amateur level. In 1995, at age 19, he became the first player to score a hat-trick in a Premiership Final and also the youngest ever winner of the Harry Sunderland Trophy for man-of-the-match in Wigan's victory.\n\nRadlinski was selected to play for England in the 1995 World Cup Final at in their defeat by Australia.\n\nRadlinski was a Premiership winner with Wigan, playing in Wigan's 44-14 victory over St. Helens in the Rugby League Premiership Final during Super League I at Old Trafford, Manchester on Sunday 8 September 1996.\n\nRadlinski played left-, i.e. number 4, and scored a try in Wigan's 25-16 victory over St. Helens in the 1995–96 Regal Trophy Final during the 1994–95 season at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, Huddersfield on Saturday 13 January 1996.\n\nIn the 1997 post season, Radlinski was selected to play for Great Britain at centre in all three matches of the Super League Test series against Australia.\n\nRadlinski was named in the Super League Dream Team of 1998.

On the other hand, \"Uxía\", Old Galician \"Ougia\", is the local evolution of the name Eugenia; hence \"Santa Uxía\" means \"Saint Eugenia\". The local church of Saint Eugenia is first recorded in a document dated in 1200, as\n\"Sancte Eugenie de Carraria\".\n\nUntil the 17th century, Ribeira's port was of little importance on the region, partly due to several incursions of vikings, saracens and pirates from the 11th to 18th centuries. Nevertheless, it grew constantly to become one of Galicia's most important fishing ports towards the late 18th century. At that time businessmen of Catalonia arrived in Ribeira and created a successful salting fish industry. King Alfonso XIII granted Ribeira the title of City on 1906\n\nEconomically, Ribeira is very dependent on the sea and it constitutes one of the most important shallow-water fishing ports in Spain. Cultivation of mussels and turbots represents an important source of income. The town also has splendid expectations facing the increase of tourism.\n\nThe population reaches 28,000 inhabitants, nearly 14,000 residing in Santa Uxía, main urban nucleus and parish.\nThere is a significant number of people settled abroad, mainly in Newark, New Jersey, Harrison, New Jersey, Carteret, New Jersey, and Bayonne, New Jersey.\n\nIn recent years the tourism industry has set their sights on the Barbanzana capital.\n\nTraces of the past can be cherished by visiting the Dolmen de Axeitos or \"The Parthenon of Megalithic\" as described by the late official chronicler of the municipality, Carlos Garcia Bayon. The remains of Celtic culture and forts are dotted throughout the Riveira territory along with petroglyphs for cultural tourists seeking a peek into the past.\n\nTourists seeking recreation in the scenic beauty have a starting point in Ribeira. The natural park of the Dunes and lagoons Carregal Corrubedo and Vixán (Dune Corrubedo) offer visitors, among other peculiarities, 1000 hectares of park and 5 kilometers of coastline. It should be mentioned that the largest moving dune in the northwest peninsular is here that is 1.2 kilometers in length and no less than 15 meters in height.\n\nAnother main tourist attraction in Ribeira is 'Festa da Dorna', a major event taking place one week prior to the 24th of July (which is a local holiday and the biggest day of the event). It has been taking place since 1948 and it was declared a Galician Festival of Tourist Interest in 2005. There are several fun activities taking place during the days that it is celebrate. People organize themselves in groups called \"peñas\", identified by colorful t-shirts and fun names related to the sea life.\n\nThe municipality is located at the mouth of the Ria de Arousa, which boasts of being the most productive shellfish area in Spain. Ribeira is one of the first inshore fishing ports so it can be said that its cuisine is intimately linked to the sea.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2062142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062142", "title": "Barbershop paradox", "text": "Barbershop paradox\n\nThe barbershop paradox was proposed by Lewis Carroll in a three-page essay titled \"A Logical Paradox\", which appeared in the July 1894 issue of \"Mind\". The name comes from the \"ornamental\" short story that Carroll uses in the article to illustrate the paradox. It was in existence previously in several alternative forms in his writing and correspondence, not always involving a barbershop. Carroll described it as illustrating \"a very real difficulty in the Theory of Hypotheticals\". From the viewpoint of modern logic it is seen not so much as a paradox than as a simple logical error. It is of interest now mainly as an episode in the development of algebraic logical methods when these were not so widely understood (even among logicians), although the problem continues to be discussed in relation to theories of implication and modal logic.\n\nIn the story, Uncle Joe and Uncle Jim are walking to the barber shop. They explain that there are three barbers who live and work in the shop—Allen, Brown, and Carr—and some or all of them may be in. We are given two pieces of information from which to draw conclusions. Firstly, the shop is definitely open, so at least one of the barbers must be in. Secondly, Allen is said to be very nervous, so that he never leaves the shop unless Brown goes with him.\n\nNow, according to Uncle Jim, Carr is a very good barber, and he wants to know whether Carr will be there to shave him. Uncle Joe insists that Carr is \"certain\" to be in, and claims that he can prove it logically. Uncle Jim demands this proof.\n\nUncle Joe gives his argument as follows: \n\nSuppose that Carr is out. We will show that this assumption produces a contradiction. If Carr is out, then we know this: \"\"If Allen is out, then Brown is in\"\", because there has to be someone in \"to mind the shop\". But, we also know that whenever Allen goes out he takes Brown with him, so as a general rule, \"\"If Allen is out, then Brown is out\"\". The two statements we have arrived at are incompatible, because if Allen is out then Brown cannot be both In (according to one) and Out (according to the other). There is a contradiction. So we must abandon our hypothesis that Carr is Out, and conclude that Carr must be In. \n\nUncle Jim's response is that this conclusion is not warranted. The correct conclusion to draw from the incompatibility of the two \"hypotheticals\" is that what is hypothesized in them (that Allen is out) must be false under our assumption that Carr is out. Then our logic simply allows us to arrive at the conclusion \"If Carr is out, then Allen must necessarily be in\".\n\nThe paradox arose out of a disagreement between Carroll and his Oxford colleague, Wykeham Professor of Logic John Cook Wilson, the two of whom had a long-running antagonism. The problem was also discussed by others with whom Carroll corresponded, and was addressed in later articles published by John Venn, and Bertrand Russell among others. Cook Wilson's view is represented in the story by the character of Uncle Joe, who attempts to prove that Carr must always remain in the shop. Others had taken the same view when Carroll circulated his privately printed versions of the problem. As Carroll noted, \"\"I am in correspondence with about a dozen logicians on this curious point; & so far, opinions appear equally divided as to C's freedom\"\".\n\nWhen reading the original it may help to keep the following in mind:\n\nSymbols can be used to greatly simplify logical statements such as those inherent in this story:\nNote:\nX ⇒ Y (also known as \"Implication\") can be read many ways in English, from \"X is sufficient for Y\" to \"Y follows from X\". (See also Table of mathematical symbols.)\n\nTo aid in restating Carroll's story more simply, we will take the following atomic statements:\nSo, for instance (¬A ∧ B) represents \"Allen is out and Brown is in\"\n\nUncle Jim gives us our two axioms:\n\nUncle Joe presents a proof:\nUncle Joe basically makes the argument that (¬A ⇒ B) and (¬A ⇒ ¬B) are contradictory, saying that the same antecedent cannot result in two different consequents.\n\nThis purported contradiction is the crux of Joe's \"proof\". Carroll presents this intuition-defying result as a paradox, hoping that the contemporary ambiguity would be resolved.\n\nIn modern logic theory this scenario is not a paradox. The law of implication reconciles what Uncle Joe claims are incompatible hypotheticals. This law states that \"if X then Y\" is logically identical to \"X is false or Y is true\" (¬X ∨ Y). For example, given the statement \"if you press the button then the light comes on\", it must be true at any given moment that either you have \"not\" pressed the button, or the light is on.\n\nIn short, what obtains is not that ¬C yields a contradiction, only that it necessitates A, because ¬A is what actually yields the contradiction.\n\nIn this scenario, that means Carr doesn't have to be in, but that if he isn't in, Allen has to be in.\n\nApplying the law of implication to the offending conditionals shows that rather than contradicting each other one simply reiterates the fact that since the shop is open one or more of Allen, Brown or Carr is in and the other puts very little restriction on who can or cannot be in shop.\n\nTo see this let's attack Jim's large \"contradictory\" result, mainly by applying the law of implication repeatedly. First let's break down one of the two offending conditionals:\n\nSubstituting this into\n\nWhich yields, with continued application of the law of implication,\n\n\nAnd finally, (on the right we are distributing over the parentheses)\nSo the two statements which become true at once are: \"One or more of Allen, Brown or Carr is in\", which is simply Axiom 1, and \"Carr is in or Allen is in or Brown is out\". Clearly one way that both of these statements can become true at once is in the case where Allen is in (because Allen's house is the barber shop, and at some point Brown left the shop).\n\nAnother way to describe how (X ⇒ Y) ⇔ (¬X ∨ Y) resolves this into a valid set of statements is to rephrase Jim's statement that \"If Allen is \"also\" out ...\" into \"If Carr is out and Allen is out then Brown is in\" ( (¬C ∧ ¬A) ⇒ B).\n\nThe two conditionals are not logical opposites: to prove by contradiction Jim needed to show ¬C ⇒ (Z ∧ ¬Z), where Z happens to be a conditional.\n\nThe opposite of (A ⇒ B) is ¬(A ⇒ B), which, using De Morgan's Law, resolves to (A ∧ ¬B), which is not at all the same thing as (¬A ∨ ¬B), which is what A ⇒ ¬B reduces to.\n\nThis confusion about the \"compatibility\" of these two conditionals was foreseen by Carroll, who includes a mention of it at the end of the story. He attempts to clarify the issue by arguing that the protasis and apodosis of the implication \"If Carr is in ...\" are \"incorrectly divided\". However, application of the Law of Implication removes the \"If ...\" entirely (reducing to disjunctions), so no protasis and apodosis exist and no counter-argument is needed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2062144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062144", "title": "Independence National Historical Park", "text": "Independence National Historical Park\n\nIndependence National Historical Park is a United States National Park in Philadelphia that preserves several sites associated with the American Revolution and the nation's founding history. Administered by the National Park Service, the park comprises much of Philadelphia's most-visited historic district. The park has been nicknamed \"America's most historic square mile\" because of its abundance of historic landmarks, and the park sites are located within the Old City and Society Hill neighborhoods of Philadelphia.\n\nThe centerpiece of the park is Independence Hall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution were debated and adopted in the late 18th century. Independence Hall was the principal meetinghouse of the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 1783 and the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787.\n\nAcross the street from Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, an iconic symbol of American independence, is displayed in the Liberty Bell Center. The park contains other historic buildings, such as the First Bank of the United States, the first bank chartered by the United States Congress, and the Second Bank of the United States, which had its charter renewal vetoed by President Andrew Jackson as part of the Bank War. Carpenters' Hall, the site of the First Continental Congress, is located on Park property as well, however the building is privately owned and operated. It also contains City Tavern, a recreated colonial tavern, which was the favorite of the delegates, and John Adams felt was the finest tavern in all America.\n\nMost of the park's historic structures are located in the vicinity of the four landscaped blocks between Chestnut, Walnut, 2nd, and 6th streets. The park also contains Franklin Court, the site of a museum dedicated to Benjamin Franklin and the United States Postal Service Museum. An additional three blocks directly north of Independence Hall, collectively known as Independence Mall, contain the Liberty Bell Center, National Constitution Center, Independence Visitor Center, and the former site of the President's House. The park also contains other historical artifacts, such as the Syng inkstand which was used during the signings of both the Declaration and the Constitution.\n\nIn response to the Intolerable Acts, which had punished Boston for the Boston Tea Party, the First Continental Congress met at Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia from September 5, 1774 to October 26, 1774. The convention organized a pact among the colonies to boycott British goods (the Continental Association) starting December 1, 1774 and provided for a Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. On May 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress assembled at the Pennsylvania State House after the Battles of Lexington and Concord marked the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. Congress adopted the Olive Branch Petition in July 1775, which affirmed American loyalty to Great Britain and entreated King George III to prevent further conflict. The petition was rejected—in August 1775, the King's Proclamation of Rebellion formally declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion.\n\nIn February 1776, colonists received news that Parliament passed the Prohibitory Act, which established a blockade of American ports and declared American ships to be enemy vessels. Although the measure amounted to a virtual declaration of war by the British, Congress did not have immediate authority to declare independence until each individual colony authorized its delegates to vote for independence. On June 11, Congress appointed the \"Committee of Five,\" consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut, to draft an official declaration of independence. Congress unanimously adopted its final version of the Declaration on July 4, marking the formation of the United States of America. Historians believe that the Old State House Bell, now known as the Liberty Bell, was one of the bells rung to mark the reading of the Declaration on July 8.\n\nAfter 1781, the national government operated under the Articles of Confederation, which gave the federal government virtually no power to regulate domestic affairs or raise revenue. At the Annapolis Convention in September 1786, the delegates asked for a broader meeting to be held the next May in Philadelphia to address the regulation of trade and the structure of the government. This resulted in the Philadelphia Convention, which met from May 14 to September 17, 1787 at the Pennsylvania State House.\n\nThe Convention was dominated by controversies and conflicting interests, but the delegates forged a Constitution that has been called a \"bundle of compromises\". At the convention, delegate James Madison presented the Virginia Plan, which proposed a national government with three branches with proportional representation. Large states supported this plan, but smaller states feared losing substantial power under the plan. In response, William Paterson designed the New Jersey Plan, which proposed a one-house (unicameral) legislature in which each state, regardless of size, would have one vote, as under the Articles of Confederation. Roger Sherman combined the two plans with the Connecticut Compromise, and his measure passed on July 16, 1787 by seven to six—a margin of one vote. Other contentious issues were slavery and the federal regulation of commerce, which resulted in additional compromises.\n\nThe Residence Act of 1790 empowered President George Washington to locate a permanent capital along the Potomac River. Robert Morris, a representative from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to designate Philadelphia as the temporary capital city of the United States federal government. From December 6, 1790 to May 14, 1800, the same block hosted federal, state, county, and city government offices. Congress Hall, which was originally built to serve as the Philadelphia County Courthouse, served as the seat of the United States Congress. The House of Representatives convened on the first floor and the Senate convened on the second floor. During Congress Hall's duration as the capitol of the United States, the country admitted three new states: Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee; ratified the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution; and oversaw the Presidential inaugurations of both George Washington (his second) and John Adams. The President's House served as the official residence and principal workplace for President George Washington during his two terms, and President John Adams occupied it from March 1797 to May 1800. At the house, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 and the Alien and Sedition Acts were signed. The Supreme Court met at Old City Hall, where Chief Justices John Jay, John Rutledge, and Oliver Ellsworth presided over eleven docketed cases.\n\nWhile plans for the permanent capital were being developed, Pennsylvania delegates continued to put forth effort to undermine the plan. The city began construction on a massive new Presidential palace on Ninth Street and an expansion to Congress Hall. Regardless of these efforts, the federal government relocated from Philadelphia for the final time on May 14, 1800.\n\nDespite its crucial role in the nation's founding, the site served most of its useful life as a municipal facility after the federal government relocated to the District of Columbia. The state government moved to Harrisburg in October 1812, and since there was little use for the Pennsylvania State House, the State of Pennsylvania considered selling it and dividing the State House Yard into building lots as early as 1802. The state came close to demolishing the hall in 1816. By 1818, the buildings had become surplus state property and were purchased by the City of Philadelphia, which used them uneventfully until late in the nineteenth century when the city government moved into a new city hall. In 1852, the Liberty Bell was removed from its steeple and put on public display within the \"Declaration Chamber\" of Independence Hall. Between 1885 and 1915, the Liberty Bell made seven trips by train to various expositions and celebrations until the city refused further requests.\n\nThe district's importance had waned with the western movement of City Hall and other institutions, but it remained an active and occupied business center. The first proposal for an Independence Hall park originated in 1915, when architects Albert Kelsey and D. Knickerbacker Boyd proposed clearing the half-block between Chestnut Street and Ludlow Street in front of Independence Hall. Kelsey and Boyd were motivated by a desire to create a fitting setting for Independence Hall, lessen the fire hazard, reduce congestion, and beautify the entire district. The idea for a park gained momentum in the 1920s and 1930s, with patriotic sentiment accompanying the American Sesqui-Centennial in 1926. The commencement of World War II led to a heightened sense of patriotism and urgency toward the protection of national monuments.\n\nOn June 28, 1948, Congress passed Public Law 795, H.R. 5053 to authorize the creation of Independence National Historical Park, and it was formally established on July 4, 1956. On March 16, 1959, it incorporated the \"Old Philadelphia Customs House\" (Second Bank of the United States), which had been designated a national historic site on May 26, 1939. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In 1973, the Pennsylvania legislature voted to transfer the three blocks that compose Independence Mall to the federal government. Independence Hall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site on October 24, 1979.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons Northeast Region Office is in the U.S. Custom House.\n\nThe National Park Service, a federal agency within the Department of the Interior, is responsible for the park's maintenance and preservation. In the 2003 fiscal year, the National Park Service spent approximately US$30.7 million on the park. Personnel and benefit costs represented about 41 percent of expenditures, and non-recurring construction and investment projects represented about 25 percent of expenditures. The Independence Visitor Center is operated as a joint venture between Independence National Historical Park and the Independence Visitor Center Corporation, a nonprofit organization. The National Park Service employs 247 permanent employees and seven seasonal employees. The park's cultural resource management program protects the historic buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural landscapes within the park, and approximately 1.5 million artifacts within the park. In 2003, the park's major projects primarily addressed repair and rehabilitation of park buildings and grounds.\n\nMost of INHP's buildings and land are contained within the broad plaza called Independence Mall, which is bookended by the National Constitution Center on the north, Independence Hall on the south, and Fifth and Sixth Streets on the east and west, respectively. The Mall was created in the 1950s by city planner Ed Bacon to bring an open space to the heart of historic Philadelphia in front of Independence Hall. Most of the buildings that previously occupied the site of Independence Mall were late nineteenth-century buildings that replaced earlier buildings destroyed by fire in 1851 and 1855. Proponents of the mall thought these buildings were eyesores because of their contrast with the historic nature of the area. As plans emerged, retailers on Market Street resisted, arguing that the demolition was out-of-scale with the comparatively small landmark at its southern end.\n\nBy 1959, when the bulldozers finished work on Independence Mall, only the Free Quaker Meetinghouse remained. The building had been used as a warehouse for plumbing supplies before its restoration as part of the project. In 1961, the building was moved 38 feet west and 8 feet south to its present location to allow for the widening of Fifth Street.\n\nTo plan for the celebration of the United States Bicentennial in 1976, the NPS relocated the Liberty Bell from Independence Hall to the glass-enclosed Liberty Bell Pavilion, as the Independence Hall could not accommodate the millions expected to visit Philadelphia that year.\nIn 1997, the NPS announced a plan to redesign Independence Mall. As part of the plan, several new public buildings were constructed. The Independence Visitors Center was opened in November 2001, the National Constitution Center was opened in July 2003, and the Liberty Bell, which had been housed in a glass pavilion, was moved into the Liberty Bell Center in October 2003. Exhibits include coverage of slavery in US history and its abolition.\n\nAt the corner of 6th and Market Street, a President's House memorial outlines the site of the former mansion and commemorates the slaves who worked there. The former building had been demolished in portions starting in 1835, and its remnants were removed during the creation of Independence Mall.\n\nIndependence Mall is bordered by the Philadelphia Mint, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the National Museum of American Jewish History, the James A. Byrne Courthouse (which houses the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania), and the main studio of WHYY-TV.\n\nFeatures of Independence NHP include:\n\nOther NPS sites associated with Independence NHP but not located within its boundaries include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2062148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062148", "title": "Might and Power", "text": "Might and Power\n\nMight and Power (6 October 1993 – 11 April 2020) was a New Zealand bred, Australian owned and trained Thoroughbred racehorse who was named Australian Horse of the Year in 1998 and 1999. As a four-year-old, Might And Power won the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups, and returned at five to become only the second horse in the history of Australian racing to win both Cups and the Cox Plate. He also won a number of other weight-for-age races in this period, including the Mercedes Classic, the AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes, and the Doomben Cup. A strong, free-striding front-runner, he broke course records in winning the Caulfield Cup, the Doomben Cup, and the Cox Plate, and won a number of races by big margins.\n\nMight and Power was foaled at Windsor Park Stud in New Zealand. He was by Zabeel out of the Irish mare Benediction, whose 13 foals for nine winners also included the stakeswinners Matter Of Honour (by Casual Lies) and Bastet (by Giant's Causeway) and the city winners Scud (by Dance Floor) and Miss Priority (by Kaapstad). In turn, Miss Priority (a three-quarter sister to Might And Power) produced the stakeswinners Miss Power Bird (by Mukaddamah) and Lucky Owners (by Danehill), who was a champion in Hong Kong. Benediction was named New Zealand Broodmare of the Year in 1998 and 1999.\n\nMight and Power made his debut late in his two-year-old season, and won his first race on 24 July 1996, at his third start. Spelled after one more start, he returned in the new year, and, once stepped up to 1,900 metres, won back-to-back restricted races at Canterbury. Up in grade, he finished second to the multiple Group One winner Intergaze in the Canterbury Guineas, seventh in the Rosehill Guineas, and was defeated by just over a length when fourth in the AJC Derby after suffering severe interference. Seven days later, as a short-priced favourite, he won the Frank Packer Plate by six lengths.\n\nMight And Power resumed in the Show County Quality, over 1,200 metres (6 furlongs) and came from near the tail of the field to defeat the Caulfield Guineas winner Alfa and the stakeswinning sprinter Armidale. He then finished second to Galactic Valley in the Tramway Handicap and Quick Flick Shannon Quality and was beaten less than three lengths in the Epsom Handicap, but Brian York lost the ride to Jim Cassidy. Stepping up from 1,600 to 2,400 metres for the Caulfield Cup, Cassidy rode Might And Power and allowed him to stride freely and at the home turn he was well clear of his opposition. In winning by the extraordinary margin of lengths, he broke the course record. The rest of the field was headed by the 1995 winner Doriemus.\n\nAfter such an emphatic win, betting markets for the Cox Plate and the Melbourne Cup were hastily rearranged, with Might and Power being installed as a short-priced favourite for both events. His trainer, Jack Denham, who had Filante set for the Cox Plate, elected to bypass the Valley feature with Might And Power and go into the Melbourne Cup without another run. At Flemington, Might And Power was to carry 56 kilograms () having received a penalty of three-and-a-half kilos (a modern record) for his win in the Caulfield Cup. This placed him just one kilo below weight-for-age for a four-year-old male horse at 3,200 metres, and within 1.5 kilograms of Doriemus, who had won the race in 1995. If Might And Power were successful, it would be the highest weight carried to victory by a four-year-old since Gurner's Lane in 1982.\n\nDespite these obstacles, as well as several European stayers and tackling the extreme distance for the first time, several large bets were placed on Might And Power on the day of the race. Starting favourite, he led, and withstood three distinct waves of challenges – Crying Game at the 1,600-metre point, Linesman on the home turn, and Doriemus over the final 200 metres. After seeing off Linesman, Might and Power led by more than two lengths with 300 metres left to run, but Doriemus emerged on the outside. Edging closer and closer, Doriemus appeared likely to score with 50 metres to go, but Might And Power found again in the final strides. In the tightest of finishes, after which Greg Hall, on Doriemus, waved his whip in salute, the photo showed Might and Power had held on.\n\nAt the end of the year, Might and Power was named World Champion Stayer.\n\nReturning in the new year, Might And Power ran third behind the Group One winning sprinters Special Dane and Al Mansour in Orr Stakes, but was beaten as favourite by the reigning Cox Plate winner, Dane Ripper, in the St George Stakes, and a minor injury forced him out of the Australian Cup (also won by Dane Ripper). Back in Sydney, Might And Power ran second to the Australian Guineas winner Gold Guru in the Ranvet Stakes, but connections were unhappy with Jim Cassidy's ride, and Brian York again took over.\n\nBack to full fitness, and well-rated by York, Might And Power recorded fast time and defeated Gold Guru and Doriemus by five lengths in the Mercedes Classic. This was the beginning of a patch of remarkable form, where he won four weight-for-age races in a row by a combined margin of more than 22 lengths. At Randwick, three weeks later, Might and Power faced a field of six in the AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes, which included the multiple Group One winners Juggler, Champagne, Catalan Opening, and Intergaze, but it was a one-act affair as he won by 10½ lengths. Taken to Queensland, he defeated the Group One winner Summer Beau by 5¾ lengths in the Hollindale Cup, and beat Intergaze by just over a length and broke the course record in winning the Doomben Cup.\n\nMight And Power's winning run came to an end when beaten on a heavy track in the Warwick Stakes, but, stepped up to 1,600 metres, defeated Juggler second-up in Chelmsford Stakes. Three weeks later, Might And Power started favourite in the George Main Stakes but faded badly in the straight. The poor run resulted from a virus, and his spring campaign appeared to be in jeopardy. Brian York was again replaced by Jim Cassidy, however, and the horse's campaign continued in Melbourne, in the Caulfield Stakes. Shane Dye led on the multiple Group One winner Tycoon Lil, but Cassidy bided his time on Might And Power, in second place, and surged to the front over the closing stages to win by just over two lengths.\n\nBack to top form, Might And Power was installed 11/8-on favourite (approximately $1.70) for the Cox Plate. His trainer, Jack Denham, had been runner-up in the two previous editions, with Filante, and victory would give Might And Power a place in history. He would become only the second horse, after Rising Fast in 1954, to win the Cox Plate and the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups, and the first reigning Melbourne Cup winner since Phar Lap in 1931 to win the Cox Plate. As a result, nearly 40,000 racegoers packed Moonee Valley racecourse on 24 October 1998. Heading down the straight for the first time, rival jockeys pressed through on the inside in an attempt to clutter him behind other horses, but Jim Cassidy swung Might And Power four-deep on the turn out of the straight, and took over down the side of the course. Setting a strong pace, the rest of the field began to tire behind him, and Might And Power turned for home two lengths clear. AJC Derby placegetter Northern Drake loomed up strongly, at 100/1, but Might And Power held on comfortably to win by just over a length in course record time.\n\nTwo weeks later, in what would prove the last win of his career, Might And Power beat a sub-standard field by seven lengths in the VRC Queen Elizabeth Stakes.

He was educated at the Manchester Academy while it was in York and then at the University of Glasgow. His younger brother, Robert Needham Philips, was MP for Bury and other members of his extended family were also elected to the House of Commons; all of them, as with Mark, supported the ideals of Manchesterism.\n\nHe has been described as a \"radical entrepreneur\" and campaigned in favour of causes promoting non-sectarianism before entering the House of Commons.\n\nThe town of Manchester was deprived of its parliamentary representation in 1660 in reprisal for its support of the Parliamentarian faction during the English Civil War. Representation was only restored following the Great Reform Act of 1832.\n\nPhilips and Charles Poulett Thomson were the first pair of MPs, elected in that year. He represented the city in Parliament until 1847. He was an active member of the Anti-Corn Law League and a champion of universal education. In 1837 he chaired a meeting that led to the creation of the Lancashire Public Schools' Association which was instrumental in establishing a system of publicly funded schooling in the UK.\n\nPhilips also played an important role in establishing England's first free public library in 1852 and he was President of his old school, Manchester Academy, from 1842 to 1846 and from 1871 until his death. He was High Sheriff of Warwickshire for 1851.\n\nPhilips donated money to many causes including £1,000 towards the fund for the provision of open spaces and parks for the City of Manchester. This resulted in many estates being purchased by the city, including Lark Hill in Salford, which became Peel Park, and the Bradford Estate which became Philips Park in east Manchester.\n\nHe died, aged 73, at Welcombe House, Snitterfield, near Stratford-upon-Avon.\n\n\n"}

Slavic \"brodŭ\"). The probable reason for the name is that the territory of the Brodniks constituted the link between the mountain passes in the Carpathians and the mouths of the Danube, having a major economical importance, assuring the access to the Genovese colonies. According to other opinions, their name is related to Slavic \"бродить\" (\"to wander\"), probably referring to the nomadic way of life of this population. Other opinions claim that the name came from the river Prut or from its purportedly old name Brutus.\n\nThe territory of Brodnici consisted of the southwestern part of today's Republic of Moldova, the southern part of today's Vrancea and Galaţi counties of Romania, the southern part of Budjak in Ukraine and probably the coastline between the Dniester and the Dnieper.\n\nAttempts have been made to associate them to better known neighbouring populations, different authors classifying them as Romanians, Iranian, or a mixed ethnic stock (Romanian-Jassic; Romanian-Slavic, or Turko-Slavic).\n\nSome authors have identified them with the \"Bordinians\" mentioned by Byzantine chronicler Niketas Choniates as a branch of \"Tauroscythians,\" a term apparently applying to the Rus people in order to distinguish them from the Cumans/Polovtsians and from Vlachs.\n\nIn 1216 they were in the service of the knyaz of Suzdal.\n\nIn 1222, the Hungarian king Andrew II gave the Burzenland to the Teutonic Knights, delimiting it by the land of the Brodnici. A Papal bull of Pope Honorius III confirmed the charter in the same year; however, in the copy approved by the Vatican, \"Brodnicorum\" was replaced by \"Blacorum\" (i.e., \"Vlachs\" in Latin). While some historians believe that this shows that the terms were equivalent, others claim that this was just an error. The latter base their claim on the fact that the two terms were used together in several Hungarian documents, very unusual if referring to the same population.\n\nIn 1238, King Béla IV of Hungary presented himself as: king of \"...Ruthenorum, Cumanorum, Brodnicorum...\"\n\nThe Novgorod First Chronicle says that in 1223 the Brodnici took part in the Battle of Kalka on the side of Mongols (\"Tatars\").\n\nWhen speaking about Brodniks, the Chronicle mentions voivode Ploskynya (the name of the voivode is sometimes rendered as \"Ploscânea\" in Romanian historiography)) who deceived knyaz Mstislav Romanovich and delivered him to \"Tatars\". Some researchers conclude that Ploskynya was the Brodnik commander. According to some researchers, the Chronicle should be interpreted as \"And there Brodniks were with Tatars, and \"their\" Voivod Ploskynya [...].\" However other disagree, considering that the source should be translated as \"And there Brodniks were with Tatars, and Voivod Ploskynya, [...].\" After this date, they disappeared from Russian sources.\n\nIn August 1227 Pope Gregory IX wrote a letter to the bishop of Esztergom instructing him to convert to Christianity \"in Cumania et Bordinia terra illis vicina\".\n\nA November 11, 1250 letter of King Béla IV of Hungary to Pope Innocent IV says that Tatars imposed tribute onto the countries neighboring with his kingdom: \"que ex parte Orientis cum regno nostro conterminantur, sicut Ruscia, Cumania, Brodnici, Bulgaria\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2062173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062173", "title": "Metapontum", "text": "Metapontum\n\nMetapontum or Metapontium () was an important city of Magna Graecia, situated on the gulf of Tarentum, between the river Bradanus and the Casuentus (modern Basento). It was distant about 20 km from Heraclea and 40 from Tarentum. The ruins of Metapontum are located in the frazione of Metaponto, in the comune of Bernalda, in the Province of Matera, Basilicata region, Italy.\n\nThough Metapontum was an ancient Greek Achaean colony, various traditions assigned to it a much earlier origin. Strabo ascribes its foundation to a body of Pylians, a part of those who had followed Nestor to Troy. Solinus also mention that it was established by Pylians. While Justin tells us it was founded by Epeius, the hero who constructed the wooden horse at Troy; in proof of which the inhabitants showed, in a temple of Minerva, the tools used by him on that occasion. Another tradition, reported by Ephorus, assigned to it a Phocian origin, and called Daulius, the tyrant of Crisa near Delphi, its founder. Other legends carried back its origin to a still more remote period. Antiochus of Syracuse said that it was originally called Metabus, from a hero of that name, who appears to have been identified with the Metapontus who figured in the Greek mythical story as the husband of Melanippe and father of Aeolus and Boeotus.\n\nWhether there may have really been a settlement on the spot more ancient than the Achaean colony, is impossible to be determined. It is known that at the time of the foundation of this city the site was unoccupied; the Achaean settlers at Crotona and Sybaris were therefore desirous to colonize it, in order to prevent the Tarentines from taking possession of it. With this view a colony was sent from the mother-country, under the command of a leader named Leucippus, who, according to one account, was compelled to obtain the territory by a fraudulent treaty. Another and a more plausible statement is that the new colonists were at first engaged in a contest with the Tarentines, as well as the neighbouring tribes of the Oenotrians, which was at length terminated by a treaty, leaving them in the peaceable possession of the territory they had acquired. The date of the colonization of Metapontum cannot be determined with certainty; but it was evidently, from the circumstances just related, subsequent to that of Tarentum, as well as of Sybaris and Crotona: hence the date assigned by Eusebius, who would carry it back as far as 774 BCE, is wholly untenable; nor is it easy to see how such an error can have arisen. It may probably be referred to about 700-690 BCE.\n\nThere are very few mentions of Metapontum during the first ages of its existence; however, it seems certain that it rose rapidly to a considerable amount of prosperity, for which it was indebted to the extreme fertility of its territory. The same policy which had led to its foundation would naturally unite it in the bonds of a close alliance with the other Achaean cities, Sybaris and Crotona; and the first occasion on which we meet with its name in history is as joining with these two cities in a league against Siris, with the view of expelling the Ionian colonists of that city. The war seems to have ended in the capture and destruction of Siris, but our account of it is very obscure, and the period at which it took place very uncertain. It does not appear that Metapontum took any part in the war between Crotona and Sybaris, which ended in the destruction of the latter city; but its name is frequently mentioned in connection with the changes introduced by Pythagoras, and the troubles consequent upon them. Metapontum, indeed, appears to have been one of the cities where the doctrines and sect of that philosopher obtained the firmest footing. Even when the Pythagoreans were expelled from Crotona, they maintained themselves at Metapontum, whither the philosopher himself retired, and where he ended his days. The Metapontines paid the greatest respect to his memory; they consecrated the house in which he had lived as a temple to Ceres, and gave to the street in which it was situated the name of the Museum. His tomb was still shown there in the days of Cicero. The Metapontines were afterwards called in as mediators to appease the troubles which had arisen at Crotona; and appear, therefore, to have suffered comparatively little themselves from civil dissensions arising from this source.\n\nAt the time of the Athenian expedition to Sicily, 415 BCE, the Metapontines at first, like the other states of Magna Graecia, endeavoured to maintain a strict neutrality; but in the following year were induced to enter into an alliance with Athens, and furnish a small auxiliary force to the armament under Demosthenes and Eurymedon. It seems clear that Metapontum was at this time a flourishing and opulent city. From its position it was secured from the attacks of Dionysius of Syracuse; and though it must have been endangered in common with the other Greek cities by the advancing power of the Lucanians, it does not appear to have taken any prominent part in the wars with that people, and probably suffered but little from their attacks. Its name is again mentioned in 345 BCE, when Timoleon touched there on his expedition to Sicily, but it does not appear to have taken any part in his favour. In 332 BCE, when Alexander, king of Epirus, crossed over into Italy at the invitation of the Tarentines, the Metapontines were among the first to conclude an alliance with that monarch, and support him in his wars against the Lucanians and Bruttians. Hence, after his defeat and death at Pandosia, 326 BCE, it was to Metapontum that his remains were sent for interment. But some years later, 303 BCE, when Cleonymus of Sparta was in his turn invited by the Tarentines, the Metapontines, for what reason we know not, pursued a different policy, and incurred the resentment of that leader, who, in consequence, turned his own arms, as well as those of the Lucanians, against them. He was then admitted into the city on friendly terms, but nevertheless exacted from them a large sum of money, and committed various other excesses. It is evident that Metapontum was at this period still wealthy; but its citizens had apparently, like their neighbors the Tarentines, fallen into a state of slothfulness and luxury, so that they were become almost proverbial for their lack of vigor.\n\nIt seems certain that the Metapontines, as well as the Tarentines, lent an active support to Pyrrhus, when that monarch came over to Italy; however, they are not mentioned during his wars there, nor it is known the precise period at which they passed under the yoke of Rome. Their name is, however, again mentioned repeatedly in the Second Punic War. They were among the first to declare in favor of Hannibal after the battle of Cannae; but notwithstanding this, their city was occupied by a Roman garrison some years later, and it was not until after the capture of Tarentum, in 212 BCE, that they were able to rid themselves of this force and openly espouse the Carthaginian cause. Hannibal now occupied Metapontum with a Carthaginian garrison, and seems to have made it one of his principal places of deposit, until the fatal battle of the Metaurus having compelled him to give up the possession of this part of Italy, 207 BCE, he withdrew his forces from Metapontum, and, at the same time, removed from thence all the inhabitants in order to save them from the vengeance of Rome.\n\nFrom this time the name of Metapontum does not again appear prominently in classical history; and it seems certain that it never recovered from the blow thus inflicted on it. But it did not altogether cease to exist; for its name is found in Pomponius Mela who does not notice any extinct places; and Cicero speaks of visiting it in terms that show it was still a town. That orator, however, elsewhere alludes to the cities of Magna Graecia as being in his day sunk into almost complete decay; Strabo says the same thing, and Pausanias tells that Metapontum in particular was in his time completely in ruins, and nothing remained of it but the theatre and the circuit of its walls. Hence, though the name is still found in Ptolemy, and the \"ager Metapontinus\" is noticed in the \"Liber Coloniarum\" (p. 262), all trace of the city subsequently disappears, and it is not even noticed in the Antonine Itineraries where they give the line of route along the coast from Tarentum to Thurii. The site was probably already subject to malaria, and from the same cause has remained desolate ever since.\n\nThough Metapontum is mentioned less than of Sybaris, Crotona, and Tarentum, yet all accounts agree in representing it as, in the days of its prosperity, one of the most opulent and flourishing of the cities of Magna Graecia. The fertility of its territory, especially in the growth of corn, vied with the neighbouring district of the Siritis. It is known that the Metapontines sent to the temple at Delphi an offering of a golden harvest, perhaps referring to a sheaf or bundle of corn wrought in gold. For the same reason an ear of corn became the characteristic symbol on their coins, the number and variety of which in itself sufficiently attests the wealth of the city. They had a treasury of their own at Olympia still existing in the days of Pausanias. Herodotus tells that they paid particular honors to Aristeas, who was said to have appeared in their city 340 years after he had disappeared from Cyzicus. They erected to him a statue in the middle of the forum, with an altar to Apollo surrounded by a grove of laurels. From their coins they would appear also to have paid heroic honours to Leucippus, as the founder of their city. Strabo tells, as a proof of their Pylian origin, that they continued to perform sacrifices to the Neleidae.\n\nThe site and remains of Metapontum have been carefully examined by the Duc de Luynes, who has illustrated them in a special work. No trace exists of the ancient walls or the theatre of which Pausanias speaks. The most important of the still existing buildings is a temple, the remains of which occupy a slight elevation near the right bank of the Bradanus, about 3 km from its mouth. They are now known as the Tavola dei Paladini. Fifteen columns are still standing, ten on one side and five on the other; but the two ends, as well as the whole of the entablature above the architrave and the walls of the cella, have wholly disappeared. The architecture is of the Doric order, but its proportions are lighter and more slender than those of the celebrated temples of Paestum: and it is in all probability of later date. Some remains of another temple, but prostrate, and a mere heap of ruins, are visible nearly 3 km to the south of the preceding, and a short distance from the mouth of the Bradanus. This spot, called the Chiesa di Sansone, appears to mark the site of the city itself, numerous foundations of buildings having been discovered all around it. It may be doubted whether the more distant temple was ever included within the walls; but it is impossible now to trace the extent of the ancient city. The Torre di Mare, now the only inhabited spot on the plain, derives its name from a castellated edifice of the Middle Ages; it is situated 2.5 km from the sea, and the same distance from the river Basiento, the ancient Casuentus. Immediately opposite to it, on the sea-shore, is a small salt-water basin or lagoon, now called the Lago di Santa Pelagina, which, though neither deep nor spacious, in all probability formed the ancient port of Metapontum.\n\nMetapontum was thus situated between the two rivers Bradanus and Casuentus (Basento), and occupied (with its port and appurtenances) a considerable part of the intermediate space. Appian speaks of a river between Metapontum and Tarentum of the same name, by which he probably means the Bradanus, which may have been commonly known as the river of Metapontum. This is certainly the only river large enough to answer to the description which he gives of the meeting of Octavian and Antony which took place on its banks.\n\nThe coins of Metapontum, as already observed, are very numerous; and many of the later ones of very beautiful workmanship. Those of more ancient date, like the early coins of Crotona and Sybaris, have an incuse fabric; that is to say that the relief design of the obverse is repeated intaglio on the reverse. Some have speculated that this feature was devised by Pythagoras. The die axes are always aligned.\nThe more common type on later obverses is the head of Ceres but in the mid-late 4th century BCE, the head of the hero Leucippus, the reputed founder of the city appears for the first time. This is thought to be related to the expedition of Alexander I of Epirus to Southern Italy.\n\n\nThe Chora of Metaponto series:\n\n"}

He had served Li Heng while Li Heng was crown prince under Li Heng's father Emperor Xuanzong and later supported Li Heng in ascending the throne during Anshi Rebellion, when Emperor Xuanzong's realm was thrown into confusion. He later became exceedingly powerful, in alliance with Emperor Suzong's wife Empress Zhang, but broke with her and killed her in 762 when Emperor Suzong died. He briefly became the paramount figure in the administration of Emperor Suzong's son and successor Emperor Daizong, but was removed and then killed by assassins sent by Emperor Daizong later that year.\n\nLi Jingzhong was born in 704, during the reign of Wu Zetian. He was castrated early in his childhood, and became a servant at the imperial stables. He was said to be ugly in appearance, but knew how to read and write, and eventually became a servant of the powerful eunuch Gao Lishi. When he was in his 40s, he became in charge of the imperial stables' financial accounts. During the \"Tianbao\" era (742–756) of Wu Zetian's grandson Emperor Xuanzong, the official Wang Hong (王鉷), who oversaw the imperial stables, was impressed with Li Jingzhong's management of the stables and recommended him to serve on the staff of Emperor Xuanzong's crown prince Li Heng. He soon became a trusted servant of Li Heng's.\n\nIn 755, the general An Lushan rebelled against Emperor Xuanzong's rule, and by 756 was approaching the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong and Li Heng to flee. During flight, the angry imperial guard soldiers escorting them killed the chancellor Yang Guozhong and his cousin (Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine) Consort Yang Yuhuan, whom they blamed for An's rebellion. After Yang Guozhong's and Consort Yang's deaths, Emperor Xuanzong was intent to continue to head to Jiannan Circuit (劍南, modern Sichuan and Chongqing), but Li Heng, at the suggestion of his son Li Tan the Prince of Jianning and Li Fuguo, decided to take some of the soldiers and head for the important border defense post Lingwu, and Li Jingzhong subsequently accompanied Li Heng to Lingwu, where Li Heng was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong).\n\nAfter Emperor Suzong took the throne, while he did not at that point make his oldest son Li Chu the Prince of Guangping crown prince, he gave Li Chu the title of supreme commander of the armies, and he gave Li Jingzhong dual titles on Li Chu's staff—serving as the head of the crown prince's household (太子家令, \"Taizi Jialing\") (although Li Chu was not yet crown prince) and acting assistant of military affairs to the supreme commander (元帥府行軍司馬, \"Yuanshuai Fu Xingjun Sima\"). Emperor Suzong entrusted Li Jingzhong with the important secrets, and Li Fuguo became in charge of receiving important reports, as well as distributing military command seals and signs. He also changed Li Jingzhong's name to Huguo (meaning, \"one who protects the state\"). By this point, Li Huguo ate a vegetarian diet and often acted as Buddhist monks did; further, when he was taking a break, he would often hold prayer beads, and people believed at that point he was benevolent. Later, when Emperor Suzong, while still fighting Yan forces, moved his headquarters from Lingwu to Fengxiang (鳳翔, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) in spring 757, he gave Li Huguo a slightly greater title as the head of the crown prince's household (太子詹事, \"Taizi Zhanshi\"), and changed his name again to Fuguo (meaning, \"one who assists the state\").\n\nDuring this time, Li Fuguo had been allied with Emperor Suzong's favorite concubine Consort Zhang, and they had a rivalry with Li Tan and Emperor Suzong's trusted advisor Li Mi. Li Tan often accused Li Fuguo and Consort Zhang of improprieties, and further, despite Li Mi's advice to the contrary, plotted to kill them. Li Fuguo and Consort Zhang, instead, acted first, accusing Li Tan of plotting to kill Li Chu. Emperor Suzong, in anger, ordered Li Tan to commit suicide. Li Chu, in fear, also plotted to kill Li Fuguo and Consort Zhang, although, at Li Mi's urging, stopped the plans.\n\nAfter joint Tang and Huige forces recaptured Chang'an later in 757 under Li Chu's command, Emperor Suzong returned to Chang'an. He bestowed on Li Fuguo a number of titles that gave him responsibility over a number of financial affairs of the state. He also gave Li Fuguo the honorific title of \"Kaifu Yitong Sansi\" (開府儀同三司) and created him the Duke of Cheng. The officials' reports continued to go through Li Fuguo, and Li Fuguo established a bureau with a number of agents with the responsibility of secretly finding out officials' faults. Even criminal cases were ruled on by Li Fuguo, and he was often making orders, in Emperor Suzong's name, reversing officials' decisions. No official dared to speak against him or even to refer to him by official title, instead addressing him as \"Master Five,\" using a form of address from a servant to a master. (This implied that Li Fuguo was probably a fifth-born son.) Even the chancellor Li Kui, who was from a highly honored household, paid him respect as a son or a nephew would, calling him, \"Father Five.\" Emperor Suzong also gave Li Fuguo, despite his eunuch status, the grandnephew of the deceased official Yuan Xisheng (元希聲) as his wife, and promoted Lady Yuan's uncle.\n\nIn 759, after Li Xian became chancellor, he secretly and earnestly pointed out to Emperor Suzong the evils that Li Fuguo's secret agents were carrying out, and Emperor Suzong, in response, issued an edict that, while confirming Li Fuguo's past acts as authorized by imperial authority, ordered that in the future, criminal cases were to be decided and appealed through official channels, thus depriving Li Fuguo of a source of power and causing him to be resentful of Li Xian. Later in the year, after Li Xian and Li Fuguo had an open conflict over the criminal charges against an imperial stable official that led to that official's execution, Li Fuguo convinced Emperor Suzong that Li Xian was simply grabbing power, and Emperor Suzong exiled Li Xian.\n\nAfter Emperor Xuanzong's return to Chang'an, he took residence at Xingqing Palace (興慶宮), which was converted from his residence as an imperial prince. Gao Lishi and the general Chen Xuanli (陳玄禮) attended to him, as did Emperor Xuanzong's younger sister Li Chiying (李持盈) the Princess Yuzhen, the lady in waiting Ru Xianyuan (如仙媛), and the eunuchs Wang Cheng'en (王承恩) and Wei Yue (魏悅). These attendants of Emperor Xuanzong did not respect Li Fuguo. To retaliate, Li Fuguo began to try to convince Emperor Suzong that Emperor Xuanzong and his attendants were plotting to seize power back. In 760, with Emperor Suzong's tacit, although not explicit, approval, on one occasion when Emperor Xuanzong was out riding, Li Fuguo intercepted him and forced him to move back to the main palace. Even on that occasion, however, Gao would not submit to Li Fuguo, and even yelled at Li Fuguo to force him to get off his horse and to escort Emperor Xuanzong on foot, along with Gao. Soon after Emperor Xuanzong was forcibly moved, Li Fuguo forced Chen to retire, Li Chiying to return to her temple (she had become an ordained Taoist nun in 711), and exiled Gao, Wang, Wei, and Ru. Emperor Suzong had his daughters Princesses Wan'an and Xianyi attend to Emperor Xuanzong, but Emperor Xuanzong, depressed over his forced movement and the exile of his attendants, began to be ill. Emperor Suzong regretted this and considered killing Li Fuguo, but feared the fact that Li Fuguo had command of the imperial guards, and therefore did not act.\n\nIn 761, Li Fuguo was made the minister of defense (兵部尚書, \"Bingbu Shangshu\"), but further wanted to be chancellor. Emperor Suzong, who by this point was fearful of Li Fuguo, refused on the basis that he did not have the support of the officials, Li Fuguo tried to persuade Pei Mian, a senior official who had previously been chancellor, to recommend him. Emperor Suzong told the chancellor Xiao Hua that if an important official (i.e., someone like Pei) recommended Li Fuguo, he would no longer have the excuse to refuse Li Fuguo's request. When Xiao subsequently discussed this with Pei, Pei adamantly stated that he would never allow Li Fuguo to be chancellor. Subsequently, Li Fuguo was not able to be chancellor while Emperor Suzong was alive, much to Li Fuguo's resentment. In 762, bearing a grudge against Xiao, he insisted to Emperor Suzong that Xiao be removed and replaced with Yuan Zai.\n\nThroughout the years, Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo's alliance held. However, as of spring 762, when both Emperors Xuanzong and Suzong were seriously ill, Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo had begun to be rivals. She summoned Li Chu (whose name had been changed to Li Yu and who had been created crown prince) and tried to persuade him to join her in killing Li Fuguo and his ally Cheng Yuanzhen. Li Yu declined, and she instead tried to persuade his younger brother Li Xi (李係) the Prince of Yue, to join her. Li Xi agreed. She and Li Xi thereafter had the eunuch Duan Hengjun (段恆俊) selected some 200 strong eunuchs, ready to ambush Li Fuguo and Cheng. On May 14, Empress Zhang issued an order in Emperor Suzong's name, summoning Li Yu. Cheng found out and informed Li Fuguo, who intercepted Li Yu at the palace gate and then escorted him to the camp of the imperial guards under Li Fuguo's command. The guards under Li Fuguo's command then entered the palace and arrested Empress Zhang and Li Xi; the other eunuchs and ladies in waiting fled, leaving Emperor Suzong without care. On May 16, Emperor Suzong died, and Li Fuguo thereafter executed Empress Zhang and Li Xi, as well as Li Xian the Prince of Yan, and then declared Li Yu emperor (as Emperor Daizong).\n\nAfter Emperor Daizong took the throne, Li Fuguo became even more arrogant, stating to him,\n\nEmperor Daizong was secretly displeased, but in order to placate Li Fuguo, gave him the title of \"Shangfu\" (尚父, \"like father\") and ordered that he not be referred to by name. He also made Li Fuguo \"Sikong\" (司空, one of the Three Excellencies) and \"Zhongshu Ling\" (中書令): the head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, \"Zhongshu Sheng\") and a post considered one for a chancellor. Li Fuguo gave a major part of the command responsibilities to Cheng Yuanzhen. Carrying out further retaliation against Xiao Hua, Li Fuguo had Xiao further demoted.\n\nMeanwhile, though, Li Fuguo did not expect that both Emperor Daizong and Cheng, who wanted more power, would turn against him. In summer 762, at Cheng's secret suggestion, Emperor Daizong issued an edict that stripped Li Fuguo of the titles of minister of defense and assistant of military affairs to the supreme commander—thus stripping him of military command—giving the latter post to Cheng. He also ordered Li Fuguo to leave the palace and take residence up outside, although he created Li Fuguo the Prince of Bolu. Li Fuguo became apprehensive and offered to retire, and Emperor Daizong declined and sent him away with formal respect.\n\nBecause Li Fuguo had killed Empress Zhang and had supported him for the throne, Emperor Daizong did not want to kill him openly. Instead, on November 8, 762, an assassin got into Li Fuguo's mansion and killed him, taking his head and an arm away as well. Emperor Daizong formally issued an order seeking the arrest of the assassin, and buried Li Fuguo in a grand ceremony, after having a wooden head and wooden arm carved to be buried with the rest of the body, although he gave Li Fuguo the unflattering posthumous name of Chou (醜, meaning \"power abuser\").\n\n"}

Toward the end of the eighteenth century, they settled alongside the riverbanks of Lawa Maroni, which now forms the border between French Guiana and Suriname. There were at least two other prior groups of escaped Africans in the area: the Ndyuka people and the Paramaccan people.

{"id": "2062216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062216", "title": "Grinding (video games)", "text": "Grinding (video games)\n\nIn video games, grinding is performing repetitive tasks, usually for a gameplay advantage or loot but in some cases for purely aesthetic or cosmetic benefits. Many video games use different tactics to implement, or reduce, the amount of grinding in the gameplay. The general use of \"grinding\" is for \"experience points\", or to improve a character's level. In addition, the behavior is sometimes referred to as pushing the bar (leveling up), farming (acquiring loot repeatedly from one source), or catassing.\n\nGrinding is a controversial subject among players. Many do not enjoy it and disparage it as a symptom of poor or uninspired game design. Others embrace it, claiming either that all games feature grinding to some extent or that they enjoy grinding. Some games, especially free-to-play games, allow players to bypass grinding by paying additional fees.\n\nGrinding in MMORPG can be advantageous, using the same strategy to repeatedly kill AI-controlled monsters to advance one's character level and unlock the content. Some games may require grinding to unlock additional features or items.\n\nSynonyms for grinding include the figurative terms \"treadmilling\" (a comparison with exercise treadmills) and \"pushing the bar\" (it can be a reference to a weightlifter \"pushing the bar\" on a bench press, over and over to get muscle gains, or a reference to Skinner boxes in which animals, having learned that pushing a button will sometimes produce a treat, will devote time to pushing the bar over and over again , or also can be a graphical reference to \"push\" the character's experience bar to higher values). Related terms include \"farming\" (in which the repetition is undertaken in order to obtain items, relating the activity to tending a farm field), and \"catassing\", which refers to extended or obsessive play sessions. Used as a noun, a grind (or treadmill) is a designed in-game aspect which requires the player to engage in grinding.\n\nSome players may program scripts, bots, macros, and other automation tools to perform repetitive tasks. This is usually considered a form of hacking or an exploit by game developers and may result in a ban. Due to the controversial subject of grinding, this act is sometimes, but not always, frowned upon in the games community.\n\nPlayers' desire to reach the highest possible level often motivates grinding. Alternatively, players might enjoy performing repetitive tasks as a way of relaxing, especially if the task has a persistent positive result.\n\nA need to grind may result from lack of game content or the inability to battle stronger enemies. If the player experiences all of a level's interesting content before reaching the next objective, but is not powerful enough to proceed, grinding may be the only available gameplay option. \"Interesting\" content is distinct from merely new content which is too similar to previous content to be considered interesting by the player. \n\nPlayers may also grind simply to become better at the game, gaining experience and leveling up. Level increases often come with additional statistical boosts and new abilities which allow the player to defeat stronger enemies, which in turn rewards and encourages grinding.\n\nWhile grinding's potential to cause players to stop being entertained may be seen as contradictory to good game design, it has been justified in several different ways. The first explanation is that it helps ensure a level playing field. According to the Pareto principle, players with better aim, faster reactions, or more extensive tactical knowledge will quickly dominate the entire game, frustrating the now-powerless vast majority. By creating a direct correlation between in-game power and time spent grinding, every player has the \"potential\" to reach the top 20% (although the Pareto principle will still apply to the amount of time spent grinding).\n\nThe problem may not be that talent and skill are rewarded, but that the rewards are based on \"relative\" talent and skill. If only the top 20% of a game's players are rewarded, 80% must be receiving a little reward, even if objectively they are highly talented. If there is no hope in the future of these players being rewarded, they will likely leave the game, causing the population to shrink, and thus reducing the number of people who can be in the top 20%. Grinding has the benefit that, although only 20% of the population may be rewarded at any given time, 100% of the population will have the potential to be rewarded in the future, and will have no reason to quit.\n\nThough grinding is used to provide a \"level playing field\", this effect could be achieved with any time-consuming behavior that is accessible to all and provides game advancement; The behavior need not be tedious or repetitive, as the term \"grinding\" generally implies. For example, in a game where advancement is gained by killing monsters, the game could provide such a huge variety of monsters and environments that no two kills are ever the same. As long as all players remained equally capable of killing the monsters, the same leveling-off effect would be generated. Thus, the \"level playing field\" effect is considered by some to be a misleading attempt to hide the real reason for grinding: unwillingness or inability to budget sufficient content resources to produce a varied game.\n\nTo solve the grinding issue, E McNeill proposes that \"the most effective path to victory should also be the most fun\". For example, challenging tasks should give better rewards than easy tasks.\n\nAnother alternative to grinding is to remove designer-defined objectives, leaving players free to do whatever they want. This creates a new problem where many players might be confused about what they are supposed to do, or they might lack the motivation to do much of anything in the virtual world.\n\nPlayers of subscription-based online games often criticize grinds as a heavy-handed attempt to gain profit. The most interesting and challenging gameplay is often only available to characters at the highest levels, who are those strong enough to participate in raids or player versus player combat. Grinding is seen as a reason to increase the amount of time it takes to reach these levels, forcing the player to pay more subscription fees along the way.\n\nThe IGDA Online Games Special Interest Group has noted that level treadmills are part of the addictive quality of MMORPGs that caters to those who play more than 25 hours a week. Another criticism of the entire leveling concept and level playing field approach is that it often allows the player to avoid difficult strategic or reflexive challenges that one might encounter when fighting powerful opponent challenges. By spending a large amount of time battling weaker or easily defeated characters (a practice known as \"bottomfeeding\"), players can gain levels to have little difficulty vanquishing the more difficult enemy. \n\nIt has also been observed that intense grinding can actively damage the role-playing aspect of a game by making nonsense of the simulated world. A classic example of this occurred in \"Star Wars Galaxies\", where skills were improved by using them. It was, therefore, possible to see groups of three people, in which: one person was repeatedly deliberately falling over, taking a small amount of damage each time; another person was healing the first, increasing one's healing skill, and taking \"stress\" damage oneself; a third person was dancing for the other, relieving their \"stress\" damage and increasing their dancing skill. \"Star Wars Galaxies\" later revised the skill system with a sweeping overhaul called the New Game Experience (NGE). Several players left the game afterward, claiming that NGE made the game simplistic.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2062225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062225", "title": "Operation Murambatsvina", "text": "Operation Murambatsvina\n\nOperation Murambatsvina (Move the Rubbish), also officially known as Operation Restore Order, was a large-scale Zimbabwean government campaign to forcibly clear slum areas across the country. The campaign started in 2005 and according to United Nations estimates has affected at least 700,000 people directly through loss of their homes or livelihood and thus could have indirectly affected around 2.4 million people. Robert Mugabe and other government officials characterised the operation as a crackdown against illegal housing and commercial activities, and as an effort to reduce the risk of the spread of infectious disease in these areas.\n\nHowever, the campaign was met with harsh condemnation from Zimbabwean opposition parties, church groups, non-governmental organisations, and the wider international community. The United Nations described the campaign as an effort to drive out and make homeless large sections of the urban and rural poor, who make up much of the internal opposition to the Mugabe administration.\n\nThe word was initially used to refer to a communal village worker by the Shona who lived in \"reserves\". Murambatsvina is a combination of two Shona words which are 'muramba' and 'tsvina'. The first word can be interpreted to mean \"to refuse\" and the second one translated means \"dirt\". These people were employed by the ministry of health to improve levels of sanitation in these areas, to communicate health information, etc. Police Inspector John Tupiri of Operations Manicaland decided on the name \"Murambatsvina\". The Zimbabwean police were ruthless in executing their duties with the result that they were dreaded by the local populace. The sense behind the word therefore mirrors the alleged purpose of the operation as asserted by the government of Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabweans refer to the operation as \"Zimbabwe's tsunami\", in reference to the devastation which followed the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The crackdown has affected most of the major cities in the country, and the Zimbabwean government has stated its intention to widen the operation to include rural farming areas. Estimates of the number of people affected vary considerably. The latest United Nations figures estimate that it has led to the unemployment of 700,000 people and affected a further 2.4 million people countrywide. Earlier, the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum estimated that 64,677 families had been displaced, representing a total of approximately 323,385 people (this estimate was based on figures from 45 locations). However, according to the police only 120,000 people have been affected.\n\nWhichever figures are correct, large numbers of people have been affected, all of whom are in need of emergency relief and resettlement following the loss of their homes and livelihood. The clearances have been condemned both internally and internationally. A report written by Anna Tibaijuka, the Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, was handed to the Zimbabwean government on 21 July 2005. Excerpts from the report, which calls for all demolitions to be stopped immediately, were made public the following day and describe the operation as a \"disastrous venture\" which has violated international law and led to a serious humanitarian crisis. The actions of the government are described as indiscriminate, unjustified and conducted without regard for human suffering. The \"Washington Post\" on 7 February 2008, described how some men and women displaced from Harare are now walking – 5 hours round-trip every day to work (furthermore without breakfast), because the individual bus fare for one day now costs nearly a week's wages – ZW$10 million.\n\nOverall responsibility for the clearances rests with the ruling party, ZANU-PF. The previous Chairperson of the Harare Commission, Dr. Jameson Kurasha, initiated Operation Murambatsvina weeks after the disputed elections were held there. The Harare Commission led by Sekesai Makwavarara is currently running the affairs of the City of Harare despite the fact that there is a pending application to the High Court questioning its authority to do so. The Commission itself was appointed by Ignatious Chombo, the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and Urban Development, leading one Zimbabwean newspaper to comment that \"President Mugabe, through the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Ignatious Chombo, is now effectively in control of the City of Harare\".\n\nMugabe said the clearances are needed to carry out \"a vigorous clean-up campaign to restore sanity\" and he has described the program as an \"urban renewal campaign.\" Chombo has described the operation in terms of 'restoring order': \"It is these people who have been making the country ungovernable by their criminal activities actually.\" The Zimbabwean Police Commissioner, Augustine Chihuri, said that Operation Murambatsvina was meant to \"clean the country of the crawling mass of maggots bent on destroying the economy.\"\n\nWhile police have carried out most of the demolitions, they have been supported by the army and the National Youth Service. Many inhabitants have been forced to destroy their own homes, sometimes at gunpoint.\n\nPeople whose homes have been demolished are being told to return to the rural areas or face further action from the Zimbabwe Republic Police and the dreaded Central Intelligence Organization. Education Minister Aeneas Chigwedere claimed that there is \"nobody in Zimbabwe who does not have a rural home\".\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has argued that Operation Murambatsvina is about restoring order (see section above). However, the timing of the clearances, so soon after the disputed parliamentary elections on 31 March 2005, combined with the contradictory nature of the operation, has prompted commentators to state that there are alternative reasons for the demolitions, although most say a combination of many of these.\n\nThe opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has argued that the government's main reason for Murambatsvina is to punish the urban poor for voting for the opposition during the March parliamentary elections. The cities are traditionally MDC strongholds, and, in fact, the Harare Commission that initiated the campaign was set up to override the governing powers of the elected MDC City Council. However, the retribution as a rationale is somewhat undermined by the fact that some Zanu-PF supporters, including liberation war-veterans, have also been caught up in the squatter camp clearances. The hypothesis that operation murambatsvina was a form of political retribution is further strengthened to almost being factual by the recurrence of a similar operation just after the disputed 2018 election. After a demonstration staged by the urban population against the Zimbabwe Government, an order was given to the municipalities to mirror the exact 'tsunami' operation that saw many demolitions taking place in January 2019, leaving a lot of people destitutes\n\nCommentators such as Tererai Karimakwenda have noted the similarity between the name of this operation and the Gukurahundi campaign conducted as part of Mugabe's struggle against the Matabele tribe in the early 1980s. The Gukurahundi campaign ultimately resulted in the demise of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) when it merged with Robert Mugabe's party in 1987. There has been speculation that the government is aiming to create a situation where the MDC has no choice but to merge with the ruling party.\n\nKarimakwenda also argued that by forcing urban voters out into the rural areas the cities will be de-populated of MDC supporters thus enabling the government to re-populate the shanty town areas with Zanu-PF supporters. Further, MDC supporters will be forced to return to live in areas traditionally viewed as Zanu-PF strongholds.\n\nScience and Technology Deputy Minister Patrick Zhuwawo used state media to say that the government had demarcated nearly 10,000 residential stands at Whitecliff Farm for allocation to what he called \"deserving people\". \"The Independent\", a Zimbabwe newspaper, has interpreted this to mean \"Zanu-PF supporters\" and supports the view by identifying the presence of \"Zanu-PF sharks\" at the centre where people were meant to sign up for new stands. A different source reported that, in Bulawayo, a Zanu-PF representative was tasked with compiling a list of future stand beneficiaries and that the resulting list was dominated by the names of known Zanu-PF supporters. One opposition supporter, whose name was not on the list, alleges that he was bluntly told that he supported the wrong party.\n\nThere were many reports in the immediate aftermath of the 2005 parliamentary elections, widely viewed by the west as neither free nor fair, of potential mass uprisings against the government. In fact, Catholic Archbishop Pius Ncube, a respected human rights activist and outspoken critic of the government, publicly called for a peaceful uprising before the elections took place, claiming that the elections had already been fixed.\n\nIt has been argued that, by dispersing MDC supporters to remote rural locations, the Zanu-PF government would find it easier to control an angry population in the event of possible riots or mass protests. David Coltart, the MDC's legal affairs spokesperson, described the operation as a sinister pre-emptive strike designed to remove the maximum possible number of people from urban areas to rural areas where they are easier to control\".\n\nOther sources suggest that former Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam, who fled to Harare in 1991, may have given Robert Mugabe the idea in the form of a security advise, warning the Zimbabwean leader that the swelling slum and backyard population in Zimbabwe was creating a fertile ground for a mass uprising.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum has advanced another reason for pre-emptively dispersing citizens living in opposition party strongholds. They point to the fact that the government faces an unprecedented economic crisis characterised by fuel and food shortages, rampant hyperinflation, and virtually no foreign currency. To resolve the crisis, they argue that the Zanu-PF government will be forced, against its will, to re-engage with the international community:\n\nThis means a reversal of its whole style of governing, adherence to the rule of law, an end to political violence and repression, opening of the press and media space, and a cessation of all interference with citizens basic freedoms.\n\nThe suggestion therefore is that if totalitarian controls were relaxed – to satisfy international principles and standards – the government would suddenly be exposed to protest and civic pressure. In other words, Operation Murambatsvina may be less to do with fear of protests immediately following the elections (which could be controlled using current methods which rely on a politicised police and army), and more to do with controlling the population \"after\" heavy-handed measures were dispensed with:\n\nIt is predicated on the observation that the greatest risk to repressive governments comes when they seek to liberalise.\n\nZimbabwean 2005 election experiences give some credence to this view. Anticipating electoral observers coming to the country, the government eased up on a few of its repressive tactics in the months immediately preceding the parliamentary elections. The immediate effect was that MDC supporters felt confident and suddenly openly showed their support for their party in a way they hadn't been able to before.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Zimbabwe fought to keep control of the foreign currency market by adopting a range of measures, usually spearheaded by Reserve Bank Governor Gideon Gono. Sokwanele, a Zimbabwean civic action support group, describes Gideon Gono as having played a major role in Operation Murambatsvina. In fact, Gideon Gono's appointment to Governor coincided with the beginning of a crackdown on illegal foreign currency dealings prompting one popular source of independent news to report that \"one of his key areas of focus is the illegal foreign currency market\".\n\nSokwanele, in a different article, explains that the foreign currency market in Zimbabwe is broadly characterised by the formal market, the parallel market and the black market. They describe the black market as follows:\n\nBlack market transactions happen on the streets, in the flea markets, and in back-rooms; sometimes for small sums of money like 20 US dollars; and the deals often take place between individuals.\n\nCommentators believe the government is specifically targeting the small-scale black market traders through Operation Murambatsvina. \"The Age\", an Australian newspaper, reported on how informal vendors at one market, dubbed \"The World Bank\", maintains a façade of trading goods when their real business is dealing in hard cash, albeit very small amounts at a time. (In fact, Bulawayo's \"The World Bank\" was one of the markets targeted when Gono first become Governor of the Reserve Bank in [2003].)\n\nFew analysts believe that the small amounts seized from vendors in one operation could begin to meet the country's massive foreign currency shortfall. This has led to some describing the government's action as indicative of their extreme desperation.\n\nZanu-PF's drive towards resolving its economic crisis has included strengthening its historical ties with China. The state-controlled newspaper \"The Herald\" reported on Robert Mugabe's support for Operation Murambastvina, and on his view that the economy was beginning to receive serious and significant investments from the Far East:\n\nWe should not look back, for, looking back, means back to our political enemies and detractors. Industry must recognise this new direction (Look East policy). \n\nThis has led some to speculate that the destruction of the shanty towns are partly in support of Chinese business interests in Zimbabwe. A report co-authored by Archbishop Ncube stated that:\n\nSpeculation over the motives behind Operation Murambatsvina has pointed to the removal of local competition threatening newly arrived Chinese businessmen whose stores sell cheap and often poor quality goods. It is estimated that, as a result of the government's aggressive \"Look East\" policy, up to 10,000 Chinese citizens have moved into the country, and some have moved onto farms taken from highly skilled commercial farmers, notably to grow tobacco for China's 300 million smokers.\n\nAs well as practical support of Chinese business interests, many have suggested that Operation Murambatsvina also demonstrates an adherence to a 'Look East' ideology and is evidence that Zanu-PF has embraced an Asian model of government where individual rights are often subverted for the good of the masses, or the regime. Robert Mugabe's approach to governance has prompted regular comparisons between him and Pol Pot.\n\nOperation Murambatsvina has been widely condemned by Zimbabwean non-governmental organisations, churches, legal organisations, and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as well as many other groups in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe operation also made topics for those in the literature world with Valerie Tagwira with her book \"The Uncertainty of Hope\", which vivified mostly the effects of Operation Murambatsvina on the ordinary female citizens of Zimbabwe and other difficulties faced by that time. The other known literature figure who hand penned the happenings of the era is a young poet and script writer, Poseidon Tsautsau who wrote his poem:The Uncaring father, who should care. In his poem it seems like Tsautsau is blasting Mugabe the Zimbabwean father for not caring for his children, by \"cleaning the mess through adding trash\" as he writes in his piece.\n\nThe international community has also condemned the operation with nations and international organisations strongly attacking the Zimbabwean government's policy.\n\nKate Hoey MP called on former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to encourage South Africa to use its regional influence to put pressure on Zimbabwean authorities to cease the crackdown.\n\nThe New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs Phil Goff expressed his condemnation of the operation by suggesting in a radio interview a boycott of the planned tour by the Zimbabwean cricket team of New Zealand in 2005–06.\n\nCondoleezza Rice, then United States Secretary of State, called upon African leaders to speak out against the Operation and to increase pressure on the Zimbabwean authorities to end the evictions. The African Union has rejected these calls stating it has 'more serious concerns'. For example, then South African President Thabo Mbeki questioned why Western leaders were so concerned about Zimbabwe while not paying the same amount of attention to far more dire African emergencies, such as civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nKofi Annan, then UN Secretary-General, dispatched special envoy Anna Tibaijuka to Zimbabwe to study the effects of the campaign and report back her findings. The report is highly critical of the government, prompting one news source to say that the report used \"language unusually harsh for the United Nations\". Excerpts of the report describe the operation as disastrous and inhumane, representing a clear violation of international law. The executive summary stated:\n\nOperation Restore Order, while purporting to target illegal dwellings and structures and to clamp down on alleged illicit activities, was carried out in an indiscriminate and unjustified manner, with indifference to human suffering, and, in repeated cases, with disregard to several provisions of national and international legal frameworks.\n\nOn 23 May 2007 the Geneva-based Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and another group, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, sought independent legal opinion. This concluded that the evictions in Zimbabwe were a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population, as part of state policy.\n\nIn a 45-page response to the highly critical report by UN envoy Anna Tibaijuka, President Robert Mugabe's government says it acted in the public interest, and denied that it was responsible for the deaths of several people during clean-up operation, and was carried out in compliance with the government's laws, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported on 17 August 2005.\n\nThe government said Tibaijuka had used \"value-laden and judgemental language, which clearly demonstrated in-built bias\" against it and the operation.\n\n\n"}

She is known for playing Lois Lane in the film serials \"Superman\" (1948) and \"Atom Man vs. Superman\" (1950), as well as the 1950s television series \"Adventures of Superman\". She appeared in 80 films and television series in her career spanning 66 years.\n\nFollowing high school graduation in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Neill took up professional acting and modeling in the early 1940s before landing the role of Lois Lane. She later appeared in various productions of the Superman franchise. Frequently cast as the parent or another relative of the main character: Neill appeared in the 1978 Superman feature film, the 1980s TV series \"Superboy\" and the 2006 film \"Superman Returns\".\n\nNoel Darleen Neill was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the daughter of journalist David Holland Neill, news editor of the Minneapolis Star Journal newspaper, and stage dancer Lavere Gorsboth. When she was 4 years old, her parents enrolled her at \"a school for aspiring performers.\" During her teen years, Neill \"danced, sang and even played the banjo at county fairs throughout the midwest.\" She attended Central High School in Minneapolis. When she graduated from high school in 1938, her first job was writing articles for \"Women's Wear Daily\".\n\nIn her teens, Neill was a popular photographic model. While Betty Grable's pin-up was number one among GIs during World War II, Neill's was ranked number two. After she signed a contract with Paramount Pictures, it led to appearances in many of the studio's feature films and short subjects. In the mid-1940s, Noel had a leading role in one of Monogram Pictures' wayward-youth melodramas, and she became a familiar face in Monogram features for the next several years, especially in the recurring role of Betty Rogers. She appeared in the last of the original Charlie Chan movies, \"Sky Dragon\" (1949), and also played damsels in distress in Monogram Westerns and Republic Pictures serials. Neill also appeared in a 1950 episode of \"The Lone Ranger\".\nNeill sang with Bob Crosby and his orchestra. She also sang at the Del Mar Turf Club, which was owned by Bing Crosby.\n\nIn 1945, producer Sam Katzman gave Neill the recurring role of Betty Rogers, an aggressive reporter for a high-school newspaper, in his series of \"Teen Agers\" musical comedies, beginning with \"Junior Prom\" in 1946. When Katzman was casting his \"Superman\" serial for Columbia Pictures, he remembered Noel Neill's news-hawk portrayals and signed her to play Lois Lane. She played the role in the film serials \"Superman\" (1948) and \"Atom Man vs. Superman\" (1950), with Kirk Alyn portraying Superman/Clark Kent.\n\nWhen \"Adventures of Superman\" came to television in 1951, veteran movie actors George Reeves and Phyllis Coates took the leading roles for the first season. By the time the series found a sponsor and a network time slot, Coates had committed herself to another production, so the producers called on Neill to reprise her role as Lois. She continued on the series for five seasons until it left the air in 1958. In 1954 she also appeared in \"Stamp Day for Superman\" which was produced by Superman Inc. for the United States Department of the Treasury to promote the purchase of U.S.Savings Bonds. It was only distributed in schools to educate children about the bond program. She was scheduled to appear in the seventh season with co-star Jack Larson in 1960, but after Reeves's tragic and sudden death, the seventh season was canceled, officially ending the show. While Phyllis Coates generally distanced herself from the role, Neill embraced her association with Lois Lane, giving frequent talks on college campuses during the 1970s, when interest in the series was revived, endearing herself to audiences with her warmth and humor.\n\nNeill continued to appear in \"Superman\"-related productions. She originated the role of Lois Lane's mother, Ellen (alternatively, Ella) Lane, in a cameo for the 1978 film \"Superman\", with Kirk Alyn as Lois' father, Sam Lane – as was the case in reverse with the role of Lois in 1951, Phyllis Coates would later succeed Neill in the role of Ella in \"\"; \"Lois & Clark\" star Teri Hatcher continued the tradition when she made a guest appearance on \"Smallville\" as Ella Lane. In an episode of the TV series \"Superboy\", Neill appeared alongside her former castmate Jack Larson, who had played Jimmy Olsen on TV. Her personal appearance at the Metropolis, Illinois, \"Superman Festival\" was featured on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\". As \"Aunt Lois\", she made a guest appearance in the independent superhero film \"\", and she played Gertrude Vanderworth (the dying elderly wife of Lex Luthor) in the 2006 film \"Superman Returns\".\n\nNeill and \"Superman\" actor Jack Larson donated their time to record commentaries for the DVD releases of the \"Superman\" TV episodes. On the documentary \"\", Neill remarked that a frequent question she would get from children was, \"Why didn't you know that Clark Kent was Superman, just wearing a pair of those darn eyeglasses?\" She replied to the children (and later to college audiences), \"I don't want to lose my job!\"\n\nOn June 15, 2010, the southern Illinois city of Metropolis unveiled a statue of Lois Lane. The Lois Lane statue is modeled on Noel Neill. Neill stated that she was honored to be memorialized with the statue.\n\nIn 2003, writer Larry Ward wrote an authorized biography of Neill, \"Truth, Justice, & The American Way: The Life And Times Of Noel Neill, The Original Lois Lane\". A limited-edition, expanded version of the book was released in 2006. In 2007, Ward wrote another book on Neill, \"Beyond Lois Lane\", which focused on the actress' other acting and modeling work.\n\nIn 2004, Neill received a Golden Boot Award for her work in Western films.\n\nIn 1943, Neill married makeup artist Harold Lierley in Hollywood, California. The marriage was annulled shortly afterward. Neill then married William Behrens in 1953 in Santa Monica, California; the marriage ended in divorce in 1962. While still married to Behrens, the \"Superman\" television program was canceled. It was then that her acting career diminished and Neill became a homemaker, later working in the television department at United Artists. Following her divorce from Behrens, Neill married Joel Taylor. The marriage lasted seven years and ended with the couple divorcing in 1971.\n\nA fall at her Tucson, Arizona home in 2010 resulted in Neill suffering from a hip fracture. She was hospitalized following surgery to repair the fracture at Tucson Medical Center.\n\nFollowing an extended illness, Neill died in Tucson on July 3, 2016, at age 95. Her publicist and biographer, Larry Ward, paid tribute to her role as Lois Lane, as did actor Mark Hamill. Neill had no immediate surviving family members. \n\nIn November 2017, the TV show \"Supergirl\" paid tribute by naming a character Noel Neill in the 3rd season episode \"Midvale\", portrayed by Erica Durance (who also played Lois Lane in \"Smallville\" before replacing Laura Benanti as Alura Zor-El post-season three of \"Supergirl\").\n\n"}

XXVIII/2, is a short, two-act opera buffa by Joseph Haydn, the first one he wrote for Prince Esterhazy. Based on the intermezzo from the third act of Niccolò Piccinni's opera L'Origille (1760), it lasts about 50 minutes. It was written in 1766, and was premiered in the fall of that year.\n\nIt was originally intended as a pair of intermezzi, each of the two acts coming between the acts of an opera seria. Similar works include \"La serva padrona\" by Pergolesi and \"Pimpinone\" by Telemann.\n\nGasparina, the songstress, and her \"mother\", Apollonia, are visited by Don Ettore, a young man who attempts to woo Gasparina with fabric and jewels stolen from his mother. When Don Pelagio, Gasparina's singing instructor and benefactor, arrives, the women attempt to disguise Don Ettore as a merchant and send him away. Don Pelagio teaches Gasparina a new aria he has written for her and asks her to marry him. \n\nWhen Don Pelagio leaves, Gasparina calls Don Ettore back in. Don Pelagio has left something behind, however, and returns to catch Gasparina and Don Ettore together. Don Pelagio and Don Ettore are both angry at having been deceived and taken advantage of by the women. Don Pelagio decides to throw the women out of their apartment, which he had given them, and begins to carry away their belongings.\n\nGasparina pleads for forgiveness and mercy, and Don Pelagio is swayed. Not only does he allow her to stay in the apartment, but he brings his own belongings to the women. Gasparina continues to take advantage of the situation, pretending to faint. The men lavish her with money and diamonds, which have a curiously restorative effect. In the end, the men recognize Gasparina's greed, but nonetheless willingly hand over their riches. \n\nThe comic potential is enhanced by Don Ettore being played as a pants role — that is, by a woman. The role of Apollonia can also be played by a man.\n\nThere are two quartets, and all characters but Don Ettore have arias to sing.\n\n\n"}

It is the second oldest university in the country, established in 1559 by then cardinal Henry, and receiving University status in April of the same year from Pope Paul IV, as documented in his \"Cum a nobis\" papal bull. Running under the aegis of the Society of Jesus (also known as Jesuits) meant that the university was a target of the Marquis of Pombal's Jesuit oppression, being closed down permanently in 1779 and its masters either incarcerated or exiled.\n\nIt was reopened nearly two hundred years later in 1973 as \"Instituto Universitário de Évora\" (University Institute of Évora) by decree of the Minister of Education, José Veiga Simão, in the site of the older university, as part of a set of education policies during the early 1970s that were attempting to reshape Portuguese higher education. Six years later, in 1979, the name was changed to \"Universidade de Évora\".\n\nThe University of Évora, the second oldest in Portugal, was founded in the 16th century by the Archbishop of Évora Cardinal Infante Dom Henrique, future king of Portugal, and the Pope Paul IV. Its administrative control was granted to the newly formed Society of Jesus. This measure could be seen as part of Henry's policies to attract Jesuits to the kingdom.\n\nThe Jesuit college in Évora operated between 1559 and 1759, when it was surrounded by cavalry troops on February 8 of 1759, as a consequence of the Jesuit banishment promoted by the Minister of the Kingdom Marquis of Pombal.\nThe \"Colégio do Espírito Santo\" became famed as a centre of learning and rivalled the University of Coimbra. Among its eminent theologians and philosophers were Luis de Molina (1535-1600), Pedro de Fonseca (1528-1599), St. Francisco de Borja, St. João de Brito, Manuel Álvares. Several prelates of the Portuguese Empire were trained at this university: D. Afonso Mendes, Patriarch of Abyssinia, and D. Pedro Martins, first bishop of Japan. The classrooms are decorated with appropriate \"azulejos\" (ceramic tiles) such as \"Plato teaching his followers\" and \"Aristotle teaching Alexander the Great\".\n\nThe University of Évora resumed work in 1973 as a state-run university.

The series follows the adventures of Bleu L. Finnegan and her friends as they attend high school during the early 1990s, specifically between the years 1991–93.\n\nChynna Clugston Flores created \"Blue Monday\" during her own high school years in the early 1990s, beginning with the characters Bleu and Clover. The series is named after the song by British post-punk band New Order. Between 1997 and 2000, individual short stories and one-pagers appeared in such publications as \"Dark Horse Presents,\" \"Action Girl Comics\" and \"Oni Double Feature\".\n\nIn 2000, editor Jamie S. Rich picked the title up for Oni Press. The miniseries \"The Kids Are Alright\" was published in 2000, followed over the next five years by three more miniseries, all released in black and white and collected as digest-sized paperbacks. \"Blue Monday\" then went on a long hiatus, with an attempt to publish a fifth miniseries in 2009 resulting in only a single issue.\n\nIn 2015, Image Comics acquired publication rights to the series and announced plans to release new editions of the paperbacks. The new books are in standard trade paperback size, with colors added by Eisner Award-winning colorist Jordie Bellaire. The Image Comics edition of \"The Kids Are Alright\" appeared in July 2016, \"Absolute Beginners\" in December 2016, and \"Inbetween Days\" in July 2017. \"Painted Moon\" was to have been published in the same format in 2018, to be followed by volume five, \"Thieves Like Us\", and an omnibus volume entitled \"Germfree Adolescents\" which would include all the published Blue Monday comics up to that point. \"Painted Moon\" was solicited for pre-order but removed from the schedule, and the future of the series is unknown.\n\nChynna Clugston Flores has stated that she has plans to continue the \"Blue Monday\" stories past the high school years and into the young adulthoods of the characters.\n\nThe story takes place in the early 1990s, mainly in the fictitious northern California town of Deadwood, which is based on the towns of Oakhurst and Coarsegold where the author spent her high school years. The main characters all attend Jefferson High School, based on Yosemite High School in Oakhurst. Nearby is the larger city of Fresburger (Fresno).\n\nChynna Clugston Flores has stated that Blue Monday is \"...about a group of outcast kids that are completely obnoxious and find themselves endlessly amusing without being self-destructive... They listen to a lot of music, daydream nonstop, are totally hormonally challenged and have a penchant for mischief and pulling pranks on one another.\" She has also characterized the series as \"\"Archie\" on crack, with cursing and smokes.\"\n\nThe main characters are social outcasts in their conventional, conservative community, and rely on each other to deal with boredom, bullying, heartbreak, vindictive teachers, and all the challenges of adolescence and coming of age. The characters' (especially Bleu's) interests in pop music and pop culture heavily influence the story.\n\n\nClugston Flores has stated that her own personal experiences from high school have helped shape the series, with a scene surrounding Bleu's attempt to mascot for her school being almost identical to her real life experience. The characters Bleu and Clover are based on aspects of her own personality and history.\n\nManga has also affected the series, with Clugston Flores listing Rumiko Takahashi and Adam Warren as influences. Dan DeCarlo (Archie Comics) and the Hernandez brothers (\"Love and Rockets\") are also significant comics influences.\n\nThe Mod subculture is prevalent throughout the series, with Christine Feldman writing in her book \"We Are the Mods\" that the series reconceptualized Mod femininity.\n\nPop music is a very significant part of \"Blue Monday\". The comic itself, all of the miniseries and all of the individual issues are named after pop songs. Some of the represented genres are 1960s mod-style rock (The Who, The Kinks), 1980s New Wave (Adam Ant, The Jam, New Order) and ska (The Beat, The Specials), punk rock, and 1990s Britpop (Blur).\n\nThe coming-of-age romantic comedy films of the 1980s also influenced the series, especially the works of John Hughes and \"Savage\" Steve Holland.\n\nThe chronology of the collected editions is different from the numbering. Timewise, the volumes come in the order: one, two, four, three. As several stories make reference to past events, this order can become confusing. In an add-on comic in volume four, Clugston addresses this issue.\n\nAn escalating war of pranks breaks out after Alan and Victor give Bleu and Clover cookies stolen from home economics class, resulting in detention for the girls. Bleu desperately tries to get tickets to see her favorite rock musician, Adam Ant, in concert, but is frustrated at every turn. She tries to win a contest for the tickets by performing the song \"Stand and Deliver,\" but despite her good performance the drunken male chauvinist emcee instead gives the tickets to the busty winner of a wet T-shirt contest. She finally wins the tickets in a radio phone-in contest, but the obnoxious bouncer and receptionist at the concert venue refuse to let her in without photo ID, which she doesn't have because she's too young for a driver's license. Meanwhile, she begins to develop a crush on Mr. Donovan, her substitute history teacher.\n\nThe kids are invited to a themed party at a friend's house in which they will act out a 1930s murder mystery. After having wine spilled on her at the party, Bleu takes a bath and is secretly filmed naked by Alan and Victor, who then threaten to circulate the tape around the school. In retribution, the girls challenge the boys to a soccer match, with the real purpose being to beat on and humiliate them through the use of \"hooligan rules.\" Bleu reluctantly agrees to go on a date with Alan to get the tape back, which ends up being a humiliating experience for him as Erin and Seamus the Pooka both separately conspire to sabotage the evening.\n\nThis collection consists of the holiday-themed one-shots \"Dead Man's Party\" (Halloween), \"Lovecats\" (Valentine's Day), and \"Nobody's Fool\" (St. Patrick's Day and April Fool's Day).\n\n\"Dead Man's Party\": The gang attends a Halloween costume party at Erin's house but are stranded when there is a power failure. They pass the time by making up and telling horror stories. Victor tells a zombie apocalypse story that heavily references \"Return of the Living Dead\", Bleu a gothic vampire romance based heavily on the original \"Dark Shadows\", and Clover a parody of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". Meanwhile, a pair of supernaturally floating Jesus heads (knocked off a statue in a cemetery in a previous story) keep trying to kill Clover because they mistake her devil costume for the real thing. The heads may be a tongue-in-cheek homage to the Hexham Heads as they are similar to size and are responsible for unwanted paranormal activity.\n\n\"Lovecats\": a Valentine's Day dance is approaching and Victor tries to work up the courage to ask Clover. There is a flashback scene to an earlier Valentine's Day dance when Bleu met Clover, Alan and Victor for the first time. After many complications, Victor and Clover kiss and begin a covert relationship.\n\n\"Nobody's Fool Part 1: Everything's Gone Green\": It's St. Patrick's Day, and Clover is in a foul mood because of the Irish stereotyping that accompanies the holiday. After drinking too much punch, she dreams that she is made to work as a scantily-clad \"booth babe\" at a convention attended by lecherous leprechauns.\n\n\"Nobody's Fool Part 2: Everybody Plays the Fool\": While reminiscing on his birthday (April 1) about his younger days, Victor dresses up in his old Goth makeup and clothing and is spotted dancing in his bedroom by Bleu and Clover. To avoid being embarrassed by their gossip, he shows up to school looking like Robert Smith of The Cure, intending to pass it off later as an April Fool's Day joke. When all the girls at school swoon over him, though, Victor decides he may have a good thing going.\n\n\"Inbetween Days\" also includes the short story \"Blue Belles,\" a crossover with Paul Dini's Jingle Belle. The gang has a memorable Christmas Eve encounter with Santa's wayward daughter.\n\nThis story follows immediately after the end of \"Absolute Beginners\", and before \"Inbetween Days\". Bleu is still upset and depressed over the incident with the videotape. Erin tries to manipulate Victor into asking Bleu out, so that Alan will stop thinking about her and date Erin instead. Victor's attempts to romance Bleu go drastically wrong, however, much to the embarrassment of both. Bleu resorts to masturbation to try to cure her insomnia, but becomes addicted to it and is mortified when she thinks Mr. Bishop suspects her \"dirty secret.\"\n\nErin covertly spreads a rumor that Clover is gay, in hopes that Victor will lose interest in her and pursue Bleu instead (with some success, though he is disappointed by the rumor). To dispel the rumor, Clover ostentatiously kisses Monkeyboy while the gang is at a bowling party. This upsets Victor, but ultimately prompts him to realise his feelings for Clover and apologise to her, to amend their friendship. Bleu, meanwhile, finally confesses her feelings to Mr. Bishop. He lets her down gently, telling her the story of how he once thought he was in love with one of his own teachers. Bleu is undeterred, however, assuming that Mr. Bishop is only put off by the fact that she's underage, and vowing to try again when she's legal. Alan, tired of Bleu's obsession with her teacher, begins dating Erin.\n\nA fifth miniseries, entitled \"Thieves Like Us\", was scheduled for release in 2009, but only the first issue was published. In an interview conducted at WonderCon 2012 (March 16–18, 2012), Chynna Clugston Flores stated that she was working on \"finishing up\" \"Thieves Like Us\" after its extended hiatus.\n\nIn January 2013, Clugston Flores stated that she had finished scripting \"Thieves Like Us\", was in the process of drawing it, and had many more \"Blue Monday\" stories left to tell.\n\nIn July 2015, Image Comics announced that it had acquired publication rights to the \"Blue Monday\" series and would be releasing \"Thieves Like Us\" as a series in 2016.\n\nAs of May 2016, the miniseries had been delayed so that it could appear after the Image Comics re-releases of the first four trade paperbacks. However, Image has released no new volumes of the series since \"Inbetween Days\", and the status of this story is unknown.\n\nIn the first issue of the series, the gang makes a springtime visit to the local zoo, and Bleu is mortified at the sight of all the animals mating. Embarrassed by her lack of experience, she resolves to lose her virginity.\n\nIn July 2015, Image Comics announced that it had acquired publication rights to \"Blue Monday\" and would be releasing a single-volume anthology containing all previously published miniseries and one-shots, entitled \"Germfree Adolescents\". Continuing the \"Blue Monday\" tradition of music-related titles, this volume is named after the 1978 album and song by British punk band X-Ray Spex.\n\nIn May 2016, Chynna Clugston Flores clarified that \"Germfree Adolescents\" would be released in 2017, so that it could include the new miniseries, \"Thieves Like Us\". This date was pushed back to 2018 at the earliest, and Clugston Flores has said that its release may depend upon the success of \"Thieves Like Us\". However, the Image Comics editions of \"Painted Moon\", \"Thieves Like Us\" and \"Germfree Adolescents\" have not appeared.\n\n"}

{"id": "2062286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062286", "title": "Cova da Iria", "text": "Cova da Iria\n\nCova da Iria is a quarter in the city and civil parish of Fátima, in the municipality of Ourém, Santarém District, province of Beira Litoral, in the Central Region and Middle Tagus Subregion of Portugal. It was where the world famous apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima occurred to the three little shepherds of Fátima in 1917.\n\nThis world-famous neighborhood is considered the wealthy area of the city of Fátima where, currently, there are numerous convents, hotels and luxury condominiums. It is located near the places of Aljustrel and Valinhos.\n\nCova da Iria was originally a field belonging to the family of Sister Lúcia in Fátima, Portugal. Lúcia and Francisco and Jacinta Marto were the three visionary children who, according to the Roman Catholic Church, received several apparitions and heavenly messages by the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God.\n\nThe children frequently pastured their families' sheep on this land, and were responsible for caring for them. In the water well of Lúcia's house they received an apparition of an angel who presented himself as the Guardian Angel of Portugal. On May 13, 1917, around noon, the three little shepherds saw an apparition of a beautiful lady \"made of light, holding a rosary in her hand\". It is told that suddenly there was lightning, and the children began to run for shelter. Just above an oak tree, they saw again the vision of the woman, later known as Our Lady of the Rosary of Fátima, who told them not to be afraid. She said: \"I come from Heaven\". They saw the lady a total of six more times, the last in October 13, 1917, when the Miracle of the Sun allegedly occurred. She told them to pray the rosary to obtain the end of the Great War.\n\nA small chapel (which was later popularly called Chapel of the Apparitions) was built at this site in the 1920s, when people were already making devotional pilgrimages there. In October 1930, the Bishop of Leiria, Dom José Alves Correia da Silva, gave his seal of approval to the reported apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima, writing in a pastoral letter: \"The visions of the children in the Cova da Iria are worthy of belief\".\n\nSince the Holy See officially approved Fátima Marian apparitions and the messages given to the three shepherd children, the place has become an important center of pilgrimage. People from all over the world travel to it in a spirit of faith and penance. The chapel has been expanded and is now much larger, enclosed within two minor basilicas in the Sanctuary of Fátima complex. Also on the grounds are luxurious hotels, a lot of convents and some medical facilities.\n\nCova da Iria, in Fátima, Portugal, has become in one of the most important international destinations of religious tourism, receiving between six and eight million pilgrims by year.\n\n\n"}

This allowed her to sit in the House of Lords prior to the passing of the Peerage Act 1963, which allowed suo jure hereditary peeresses to enter. She and her two younger sisters were memorialised by Anne de Courcy in \"The Viceroy's Daughters: the Lives of the Curzon Sisters\".\n\nIrene was born at 4 Carlton House Gardens, St James's the eldest child of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston and Mary Victoria Leiter, daughter of Levi Ziegler Leiter. She inherited her father's Barony of Ravensdale, County Derby, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, on 20 March 1925, and was created a life peer as Baroness Ravensdale of Kedleston, of Kedleston, in the County of Derby on 6 October 1958. This allowed her to sit in the House of Lords prior to the passing of the Peerage Act 1963, which allowed suo jure hereditary peeresses to enter. She and her two younger sisters were memorialised by Anne de Courcy in \"The Viceroy's Daughters: the Lives of the Curzon Sisters\".\n\nIrene Curzon had an intimate insight into the life of the Duke of Windsor, his friendship and marriage to Wallis Simpson and the life of the House of Windsor, through her sister, Alexandra and her brother-in-law Major Edward Dudley Metcalfe, best friend of Edward VIII. She saw the rise of British fascism through her sister Lady Cynthia Mosley and her other brother-in-law Sir Oswald Mosley, with whom she had a brief fling prior to their marriage.\n\nIrene was a \"tall and stately beauty\" according to her friend Charlotte Greenwood. Irene's father was the successful diplomat-politician George Curzon. Appointed Viceroy of India in 1898, she went out with her mother and sisters to live in New Delhi. Shortly after they returned to England, Lord Curzon resigned, in 1905, at the end of a long period of Conservative government. Created Earl of Kedleston and Baron Ravensdale in 1911, the titles were in reversion to daughters as well as heirs male.\nShe was intensely musical and passionate about fox hunting, bridge and parties. She had numerous love affairs within the elite Melton Mowbray hunting clique and had a long relationship with the renowned pianist Arthur Rubinstein, whom she said she slept with on his wedding day. During the Great War she went to a club in the East End of London to sing to the working men and women as part of a voluntary job. And in the last year of the war she went to the gender-specific YMCA to take care of the poor and dispossessed in France.\n\nBoth Victor Cazalet and Nevile Henderson proposed to her. She was briefly engaged to Miles Graham on the rebound from a long entanglement with Gordon Leith but never married and had no children. She became a guardian to the children of Oswald Mosley's three children, following the death of his wife Cynthia who was Irene's younger sister. She was particularly attached to Michael who was a small child when his mother died. She worried that she and her money might be seen primarily as useful accompaniments to a political career and yearned to marry a man that would refuse to leave his wife.\n\nDespite her active social life, she maintained a strong dedication towards welfare work. She was appointed the chair of Highways Clubs Inc. In 1936 which provided music, handicrafts and physical training to young disadvantaged people. She was also appointed vice-president of the National Association of the Girls Clubs and Mixed Clubs. And then she was the obvious candidate to be the president of the London Union of Youth Clubs.\n\nA confirmed Anglican, she was most tolerant of other religions. Her friend, the Asian explorer, Sir Francis Younghusband, considered by parliament one of the heroes of the age, helped her form the World Congress of Faiths. It was an ecumenical organisation that aimed to bring all faiths together in a spirit of unity and co-operation. She was chairman from 1942 and in the 1960s became founder president. Most especially she warmed to the caring, compassion of Bhuddist gurus for their spiritualism and \"priceless truths\". In a world of the \"unhappy distractions of materialism\", she wrote in 1936, people needed a spiritual design for living in a greater universalism.\" She said in her peroration \"... all the prejudices against women ... are unjustifiable.\"\n\nDuring World War II she was based at the Dorchester Hotel, nicknamed 'the Dorch', her days spent nursing wounded soldiers, working in canteens, lecturing and doing other war work. Curzon was made the fourth female life peer for her work with youth clubs. Her youngest sister, Alexandra, was also recognised a CBE for her tireless efforts on behalf of Save the Children Fund. In later years she demonstrated how she had worked hard all her career to campaign for others, for charity and to get women into the House of Lords. On 22 October 1958 she was created one of the first four Life Peeresses and introduced to the Lords. She sat on the Cross bench when she made a maiden speech on 4 February 1959, in which she discussed funding youth services. She called on the government to take grant aid seriously to fund a voluntary sector that was understaffed. In Charity Commissioners Act 1959, the Macmillan administration conducted a major overhaul of the sector.\n\nSpeaking on the Street Offences bill 1959 she criticised the law that blamed women for seeking income from prostitution, and instead sought to punish the men. She accused the government of permitting the burgeoning club scene in London, particularly to thrive, off criminal gangs, pimps and ponces. Her clever use of humour and language interspersed with Tory shock tactics impressed her fellow peers. In celebrating youth services, the baroness affirmed the Albemarle Report; finding a need for 'professionalised' recruitment was not the answer to a million youngsters by 1962, by moral and ethical principles. Lady Ravensdale died in 1966. She was succeeded in her hereditary peerage by her nephew, Nicholas Mosley, son of Sir Oswald Mosley by his first wife Cynthia Curzon.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2062296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062296", "title": "Immaculate Heart of Mary", "text": "Immaculate Heart of Mary\n\nThe Immaculate Heart of Mary is a devotional name used to refer to the interior life of the Blessed Virgin Mary, her joys and sorrows, her virtues and hidden perfections, and, above all, her virginal love for God the Father, her maternal love for her son Jesus, and her compassionate love for all people.\n\nThe Eastern Catholic Churches occasionally utilize the image, devotion, and theology associated with the Immaculate Heart of Mary. However, this is a cause of some controversy, some seeing it as a form of liturgical latinisation. The Roman Catholic view is based on scripture, particularly the Gospel of Luke. Traditionally, the heart is depicted pierced with seven wounds or swords, in homage to the seven dolors of Mary. Also, roses or another type of flower may be wrapped around the heart.\n\nThe veneration of the Heart of Mary is analogous to the worship of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. There are, however, differences in this analogy as devotion to the heart of Jesus is especially directed to the \"divine heart\" as overflowing with love for humanity. In the devotion to Mary, however, the attraction is the love of her heart for Jesus and for God.\n\nThe second difference is the nature of the devotion itself: in the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Roman Catholic venerates in a sense of love responding to love, in the devotion to the Heart of Mary, study and imitation hold as important a place as love. The aim of the devotion is to unite humankind to God through Mary's heart, and this process involves the ideas of consecration and reparation. The object of the devotion being to love God and Jesus better by uniting one's self to Mary for this purpose and by imitating her virtues. \n\nIn Chapter 2 of St. Luke's gospel, the evangelist twice reports that Mary kept all things in her heart, that there she might ponder over them. Luke 2:35 recounts the prophecy of Simeon that her heart would be pierced with a sword. This image (the pierced heart) is the most popular representation of the Immaculate Heart.\n\nSt. John's Gospel further invited attention to Mary's heart with its depiction of Mary at the foot of the cross at Jesus' crucifixion. St. Augustine said of this that Mary was not merely passive at the foot of the cross; \"she cooperated through charity in the work of our redemption\".\n\nSt. Leo said that through faith and love she conceived her son spiritually, even before receiving him into her womb, and St. Augustine says that she was more blessed in having borne Christ in her heart than in having conceived him in the flesh.\n\nDevotion to the Heart of Mary began in the Middle Ages with Anselm of Canterbury, and Bernard of Clairvaux. It was practiced and developed by Mechtilde, Gertrude the Great and Bridget of Sweden. Evidence is also discernible in the pious meditations on the \"Ave Maria\" and the \"Salve Regina\", usually attributed either to Saint Anselm of Lucca (d. 1080) or Saint Bernard; and also in the large book \"De laudibus Beatae Mariae Virginis\" (Douai, 1625) by Richard de Saint-Laurent, Penitentiary of Rouen in the thirteenth century.\n\nSaint Bernardine of Siena (d.1444), is sometimes called \"Doctor of the Heart of Mary\", and from him the Church has borrowed the lessons of the second nocturn for the feast of the Heart of Mary. Saint Francis de Sales speaks of the perfections of this heart, the model of love for God, and dedicated his \"Theotimus\" to it.\n\nDuring this same period one finds occasional mention of devotional practices to the Heart of Mary, e.g., in the \"Antidotarium\" of Nicolas du Saussay (d. 1488), in Pope Julius II, and in the \"Pharetra\" of Lanspergius. In the second half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth, ascetic authors dwelt upon this devotion at greater length.\n\nIt was, however, Saint John Eudes (d. 1681) who propagated the devotion, to make it public, and to have a feast celebrated in honor of the Heart of Mary, first at Autun in 1648 and afterwards in a number of French dioceses. He established several religious societies interested in upholding and promoting the devotion, of which his large book on the \"Coeur Admirable\" (\"Admirable Heart\"), published in 1681, resembles a summary. Jean Eudes' efforts to secure the approval of an office and feast failed at Rome, but, notwithstanding this disappointment, the devotion to the Heart of Mary progressed. Eudes began his devotional teachings with the Heart of Mary, and then extended it to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. However, it was only in 1805 that Pope Pius VII allowed a feast to honor the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nIn 1699 Father Pinamonti (d. 1703) published a short work on the Holy Heart of Mary in Italian, and in 1725, Joseph de Gallifet combined the cause of the Heart of Mary with that of the Heart of Jesus in order to obtain Rome's approbation of the two devotions and the institution of the two feasts. In 1729, his project was defeated, and in 1765, the two causes were separated, to assure the success of the principal one.\n\nTwo factors that helped the rapid progress of the devotion were the introduction of the Miraculous Medal by Catherine Laboure in 1830 and the establishment at Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, Paris of the \"Archconfraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Refuge of Sinners\". More than four million Miraculous Medals were distributed throughout the world within four years and in 1838 Father Desgenettes, the pastor of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, organized the Association in honor of the Holy and Immaculate Heart of Mary, which Pope Gregory XVI made a confraternity the same year. In July, 1855, the Congregation of Rites approved the Office and Mass for the Immaculate Heart.\n\nIn its principal object this feast is identical with the feast of the \"Inner Life of Mary\", celebrated by the Sulpicians on 19 October. It commemorates the joys and sorrows of the Mother of God, her virtues and perfections, her love for God and her Divine Son and her compassionate love for mankind.\n\nAs early as 1643, St. John Eudes and his followers observed 8 February as the feast of the Heart of Mary.\nIn 1799 Pius VI, then in captivity in Florence, granted the Bishop of Palermo the feast of the \"Most Pure Heart of Mary\" for some of the churches in his diocese. In 1805 Pope Pius VII made a new concession, thanks to which the feast was soon widely observed. Such was the existing condition when a twofold movement, started in Paris, gave fresh impetus to the devotion; the two factors of this movement were, first of all, the revelation of the \"Miraculous Medal\" in 1830, and then the establishment at Notre-Dame-des-Victoires of the Archconfraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Refuge of Sinners, which spread rapidly. \nOn 21 July 1855, the Congregation of Rites finally approved the Office and Mass of the Most Pure Heart of Mary without, however, imposing them upon the Universal Church.\n\nPope Pius XII instituted the feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1944 to be celebrated on 22 August, coinciding with the traditional octave day of the Assumption. In 1969, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration of the Immaculate Heart of Mary to the Saturday, immediately after the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. This means in practice that it is now held on the third Saturday after Pentecost.\n\nAt the same time as he closely associated the celebrations of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration of the Queenship of Mary from 31 May to 22 August, bringing it into association with the feast of her Assumption. Those who use the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal or an earlier one (but not more than 17 years before 1962) observe the day established by Pius XII.\n\nIt is kept as the patronal feast of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost, of the Society of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and of the Missionary Society of the Heart of Mary.\n\nThe celebration of this feast is omitted in those years when it is impeded by a higher ranking feast. This would apply \nwhen it is due to fall on 24 June (Nativity of St John the Baptist) and\n29 June (Saints Peter and Paul), and more rarely\n31 May (Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary) and 3 July (Saint Thomas the Apostle).\nIt is also impeded when it is due to fall on 25 June and 30 June because of the coincidence of solemnities the day\nbefore, necessitating the transfer of one of them to the following [available] day.\n(Note that there may be variations in local calendars. For example, this feast is not impeded in\nEngland and Wales in 2019 since Saints Peter and Paul will be celebrated on Sunday 30 June.)\n\nTraditional depictions of the IHM show it pierced with seven wounds or swords, in homage to the seven dolors of Mary. The Seven Sorrows of Mary are a popular Roman Catholic devotion. There are devotional prayers which consist of meditation on her Seven Sorrows. One practice is to pray seven Hail Marys daily. The term \"Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary\" refers to the combined devotion of both the Immaculate Heart and the Seven Sorrows of Mary as first used by the Franciscan Tertiary Berthe Petit.\n\nThe devotion to Mary's Heart has had a greater flowering following the manifestation of the Miraculous Medal to St. Catherine Labouré in 1830. The Immaculate Heart is depicted on the Miraculous Medal, pierced by a sword. The Sacred Heart of Jesus also appears on the medal, next to the Immaculate Heart, crowned with thorns. The M on the medal signifies the Blessed Virgin at the foot of the Cross when Jesus was being crucified.\n\nOur Lady of Fátima asked that, in reparation for the sins committed against her Immaculate Heart, on the first Saturday of five consecutive months a Catholic believer go to the Sacrament of Penance (within eight days before or after the first Saturday), receive the Holy Communion, recite five decades of the Rosary, and keep her company for 15 minutes while meditating on the 15 mysteries of the Rosary. She promised that, whoever would ever do this, would be given the graces necessary for salvation at the hour of one's death.\n\nThe Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary is based on the historical, theological and spiritual links in Catholic devotions to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The joint devotion to the hearts was first proposed in the 17th century by St. John Eudes who organized the scriptural, theological and liturgical sources relating to the devotions and obtained the approbation of the Church, prior to the visions of St. Margaret Mary Alacoque.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries the devotions grew, both jointly and individually through the efforts of figures such as Louis de Montfort and St. Catherine Labouré. The Miraculous Medal depicted the Heart of Jesus thorn-crowned and the Heart of Mary pierced with a sword. The devotions, and the associated prayers, continued in the 20th century, e.g., in the Immaculata prayer of St. Maximillian Kolbe and in the reported apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima.\n\nThe Popes have supported the individual and joint devotions to the hearts through the centuries; in 1956 the encyclical \"Haurietis aquas\", Pope Pius XII encouraged the joint devotion to the hearts. In 1979 the encyclical \"Redemptor hominis\", Pope John Paul II explained the theme of unity of Mary's Immaculate Heart with the Sacred Heart. In his Angelus address on 15 September 1985 he coined the term \"The Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary\", and in 1986 addressed the international conference on that topic held at Fátima, Portugal.\n\nDuring the third apparition at Fátima, Portugal, on 13 July 1917, Our Lady allegedly said to the three little shepherds: \"God wishes to establish the devotion to her Immaculate Heart in the world\" in order to save souls from hell and bring about world peace, and also asked for the consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart. Pope Pius XII, in his Apostolic Letter of 7 July 1952 \"Sacro Vergente\", consecrated Russia to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nAlso, the Blessed Alexandrina of Balazar, in Portugal, reported many private apparitions, messages and prophecies received directly from Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary. In June 1938, based on the request of her spiritual director Father Mariano Pinho, several bishops from Portugal wrote to Pope Pius XI, asking him to consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. At that time Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) was the secretary of the state of the Vatican, and later he performed the consecration of the world.\n\nOn 25 March 1984 Pope John Paul II fulfilled this request again, when he made the solemn act of consecration of the world, and implicitly of Russia, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary before the miraculous statue of Our Lady of Fátima brought to Saint Peter's Square in the Vatican for the occasion. Sister Lúcia, OCD, then the only surviving visionary of Fátima apparitions, confirmed that the request of Mary for the consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary was accepted by Heaven, and therefore, was fulfilled. \nAgain on October 8, 2000, the same pope made an act of entrustment of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the new millennium.\n\nIn August 2013, Pope Francis announced that he would consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on 13 October 2013, as part of the Marian Day celebration that involved the iconic statue of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fátima.\n\nThe whole world has been repeatedly consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by different popes:\n\n\nOn 25 March 200, the Feast of the Annunciation, in Fatima, Cardinal António Marto, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leiria–Fátima presided over the consecration of twenty-two countries to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Although initially intended for Portugal and Spain, as the days drew close for the consecration, the episcopal conferences from twenty-two other countries expressed an interest in joining. Those countries included: Albania, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, East Timor, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Kenya, Mexico, Moldova, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.\n\nSeveral national bishops' conferences have also made a consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary of their respective countries.\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

The Carmelite nun Sister Lúcia, one of the three visionaries of the apparitions, stated that at different times the Virgin Mary had given her messages that emphasized praying the Rosary, and that she had made a number of prophecies and promises, one of these being that the consecration of Russia would usher in a period of world peace. The Vatican claimed that Sister Lúcia declared in writing during the 1980s that the consecration performed by Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square, in the Vatican City, on March 25, 1984 had been properly accomplished and was accepted in Heaven. The authenticity of this is not accepted, however, by some leaders at the Fatima Centre including Fr. Nicholas Gruner and Christopher Ferrara. \n\nIn addition to this Consecration, Pope Pius XII (1942), Pope John Paul II (1984), Pope Benedict XVI (2010) and Pope Francis (2013) have consecrated the world to the Immaculate Heart, with Pius XII also specifically consecrating \"the peoples of Russia\" in 1952, sometimes worded as \"acts of entrustment\".\n\nThe teaching of the Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between \"public Revelation\" and \"private revelations\". The term \"public Revelation\" finds its literary expression in the Bible and \"reached its fulfilment in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ\". In this regard, The Catechism of the Catholic Church quotes John of the Cross:In giving us his Son, his only Word (for he possesses no other), he spoke everything to us at once in this sole Word—and he has no more to say... Any person questioning God or desiring some vision or revelation would be guilty not only of foolish behavior but also of offending him, by not fixing his eyes entirely upon Christ and by living with the desire for some other novelty.\n\nIn a meeting with Cardinal Sodano, Sister Lucia pointed out that she had received the vision but not its interpretation.\n\nAccording to Sister Lúcia, the Virgin Mary requested the consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart on several occasions.\n\nLúcia lived in Spain from 1925 to 1946, during the time of the Second Spanish Republic and the Spanish Civil War. Her first mention of the Blessed Virgin's request for the consecration of Russia is in the autumn of 1929. In 1929 Lúcia Santos was a novice at the Sisters of St. Dorothy convent in Tuy, Spain. Lúcia reported that on the night of 13 June 1929, while she was praying in chapel, that she experienced a vision in which the Blessed Virgin said that it was God's will that the Pope, in union with all the Bishops of the world, consecrate Russia to her Immaculate Heart. Sister Lúcia reported this to her confessor who asked her to write it down.\n\nIn two letters she sent in May 1930 to Fr. Gonçalves, her confessor, Lúcia linked the consecration of Russia with the Devotion of the Five First Saturdays, which she had first discussed in context of the apparitions she had purportedly experienced previously as a postulant at Pontevedra in 1925. (The Church has issued no decision regarding the reported visions at either Pontevedra or Tuy. \nIn August 1941 Sister Lúcia wrote her third memoir in which she described the apparition of 13 July 1917. She said that the Virgin told them: \n\nOrthodox Christians often see the Fátima consecration in the light of the history of Latin-Orthodox religious conflict going back a thousand years. They tend to interpret the Fátima consecration as an encroachment by Latin Christianity on Orthodox territory while Catholics tend to see the matter as followers of Christ vs. atheistic Communism. Orthodox Christians and especially members of the Russian Orthodox Church object to the concept of the Consecration of Russia for two reasons: (1) Russia was already Christian at the time of the alleged Fátima apparitions and had a long history of devotion to the Theotokos, and (2) the concept contains what appears to be an implicit proselytism of Russian Orthodox Christians to the Catholic Faith. Orthodox apologists thus tend to understand the phrase \"Russia will be converted\" as implying conversion from Orthodox Christianity to Roman Catholicism and acceptance of papal infallibility and universal supreme jurisdiction. Catholics respond that the apparitions at Fátima took place after the March 1917 revolution that deposed Tsar Nicholas and the April 16 [N.S.] return to Russia of Lenin. Russia was thus already in the throes of revolution and facing a renewed threat from a Bolshevism particularly hostile to all organized religion when prayers for Russia were first requested in May. The final October miracle occurred just weeks before the Communist Revolution. They argue that this timing suggests that the consecration refers to the threat that Russia faced from atheistic Communism. \n\nIn 1946 during a gathering of youth at Fátima, Sister Lucia was asked by a young Russian girl (Natacha Derfelden) how the conversion of Russia would come about. However, Sister Lucia stated that the conversion of Russia would come through the Orthodox Church and \"the Oriental rite\", seemingly meaning the conversion implied reconciliation and reunion between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. Yet, another possibility is that it means a conversion of the heart, which conforms to the theological commentary written by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) on the Fátima secret.\n\nHowever, the conception of Theotokos Derzhavnaya Orthodox icon points out that Virgin Mary is considered actual Tsarina of Russia by the religious appeal of Nicholas II; thus Consecration of Russia may refer to a return of Russian monarchy. The icon was brought to Fátima in 2003 and 2014, together with another significant Theotokos of Port Arthur icon.\n\n\n\n"}

She won seven singles titles and fifteen doubles titles on WTA Tour. She reached her first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the 2007 Australian Open, upsetting defending champion Amélie Mauresmo in the fourth round, her first Grand Slam semifinal at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships and her first Grand Slam final at the 2015 French Open. She also won the 2015 Australian Open, 2015 French Open, 2016 US Open, 2017 Australian Open and 2017 French Open women's doubles titles partnering with Bethanie Mattek-Sands, as well as the bronze medal in women's doubles at the 2016 Olympic Games alongside her compatriot Barbora Strýcová, upsetting the defending gold medalists Venus and Serena Williams in the first round.\n\nŠafářová plays left-handed with a two-handed backhand and possesses a high topspin forehand. Her timing off the ground allows her to project groundstrokes with power, and she is quick to spot opportunities to take the initiative. Šafářová is notorious for having a volatile return that is capable of hitting clean winners, as well as unforced errors. Her preferred surface is clay. She was coached by Rob Steckley until September 2016 when she split with him, ending a coaching relationship of more than three and a half years, and hired František Čermák. In December 2017, Safarova announced that she is reuniting with Rob Steckley for the 2018 season.\n\nŠafářová won her first WTA Tour event in May 2005 at the Estoril Open in Portugal, where she defeated fourth-seeded Li Na in a three-sets final. In June she lost the final of the Rosmalen grass court tournament to fellow Czech Klára Koukalová in three sets. She won her second tournament at the Forest Hills Tennis Classic in August, which was played at the historic West Side Tennis Club, after a victory in the final against Sania Mirza.\n\nŠafářová started off 2006 by upsetting world No. 6 Patty Schnyder in the semifinals of the Gold Coast tournament and then winning in the final with a straight-set victory. Also in 2006, she made her first Tier II semifinal at Amelia Island, where she upset Nicole Vaidišová in the round of 16. She later lost to eventual champion Nadia Petrova. She then made another semifinal at the Tier-IV tournament at Palermo, where she was defeated by Anabel Medina Garrigues.\n\nAt the start of 2007, Šafářová elected to represent the Czech Republic in the Hopman Cup instead of defending her Gold Coast title. Due to not defending the points at that tournament, she came into the first Grand Slam of the year ranked No. 70 and unseeded. Yet she made headlines at the Australian Open, when she stunned the defending champion and No. 2 seed Amélie Mauresmo in the fourth round. She then lost to fellow Czech Nicole Vaidišová in the quarterfinals. After the Australian Open, her ranking rose from No. 70 to 31.\n\nŠafářová continued her good start to 2007 at the Open Gaz de France in Paris. She reached the final by defeating Tsvetana Pironkova in three sets and Nicole Vaidišová, Svetlana Kuznetsova, and Justine Henin, all in straight sets. However, she lost the final against Nadia Petrova in three sets. She pulled out of her next event in Antwerp due to a shoulder injury.\n\nŠafářová lost in round three of both Indian Wells and Miami to Shahar Pe'er and Serena Williams, respectively. She defeated Daniela Hantuchová in the Czech Republic vs. Slovak Republic Fed Cup encounter.

However, in the third round, she lost to world No. 3 Jelena Janković in three sets after coming within two points of another Grand Slam upset. The match was described as the best WTA match of 2007 up to that point and the best women's Wimbledon match in many years. Šafářová entered the US Open as the 20th seed. She defeated Jessica Moore in the first round and Andrea Petkovic in the second round. She fell to Marion Bartoli in the third round. In 2007, she advanced to the third round or better in all four Grand Slams including the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, which was the best Grand Slam result at that point of her career.\n\nAt the beginning of 2008, Šafářová again decided to enter the Hopman Cup in Perth. She was ranked No. 23 and took on world No. 56 Alicia Molik of Australia. She lost the match followed by a loss with her partner on and off the court, Tomáš Berdych, in mixed doubles. Against the United States, she lost to Serena Williams in three sets. Šafářová and Berdych lost the first set of the mixed doubles and then retired from the match due to Berdych's health concerns. The Czechs closed the Cup by defeating India 2-1. Šafářová won her singles match against Sania Mirza in three sets. After Berdych also won his singles match and clinched the victory, Šafářová and Berdych lost the mixed-doubles match.\n\nŠafářová's second competition of the year was the Sydney Medibank International. In the first round, she faced Alicia Molik. Šafářová won in two tiebreaks. Both players had set points and match points throughout the tiebreaker, but Šafářová was able to come out on top. She subsequently pulled out of the second round against world No. 1, Justine Henin.\n\nŠafářová entered the Australian Open as the 22nd seed. In the first round, she faced Catalina Castaño of Colombia and lost in 71 minutes. Later, it was revealed that a gluteal strain was plaguing her during the match.

Competing at the Pacific Life Open in the United States, Šafářová, seeded 26th, lost in three sets in the second round to Ashley Harkleroad. Following that, Šafářová played the Sony Ericcson Open, where she lost to fourth seed Jelena Janković.\n\nAt the Summer Olympics, Šafářová competed in both singles and women's doubles. She reached the third round of the singles by beating Maret Ani and Mariya Koryttseva before losing to Sybille Bammer. In the women's doubles, she and partner Petra Kvitová were knocked out in the first round. She followed the Olympics by winning the Forest Hills Tennis Classic for the second time. She became the first and only player to win the Classic more than once as 2008 was the last edition of the tournament.\n\nŠafářová began the year with a quarterfinal showing at the international hard court event in Brisbane. She defeated the Australians Isabella Holland and Samantha Stosur before being defeated by second-seeded Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. After failing to qualify for the premier event in Sydney, she reached the third round of the Australian Open by defeating Sybille Bammer and Marina Erakovic before losing to Marion Bartoli in three sets. She did not advance past the second round in any of the other Grand Slam tournaments in 2009.\n\nŠafářová started the 2010 season by reaching the quarterfinals of the Brisbane International, where she lost to eventual champion Kim Clijsters. She then suffered first round losses at the Hobart International, where she retired against Kateryna Bondarenko in the third set, and the Australian Open, where she lost to sixth seed Venus Williams. She made her first final of the year at the Open GdF Suez in Paris by defeating Flavia Pennetta in the semifinals. In the final, she won the first set, but could not hold on and fell in three sets to top seed Elena Dementieva. In her next two tournaments, she then suffered two more first round losses.

The French Open would be her best singles result at a Grand Slam in 2010 as she lost in the first round at both Wimbledon and the US Open.\n\nŠafářová began the year at the Brisbane International where she made it to the quarterfinals after tough matches against Akgul Amanmuradova and Shahar Pe'er where she lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in three sets. As the 31st seed at the Australian Open, she struggled through her first two rounds, but defeated Zhang Shuai and Klára Zakopalová, respectively. In the third round, she lost in two sets to world No. 2, Vera Zvonareva, despite having had a set point in the second set.\n\nFollowing the Australian Open, Šafářová defeated Daniela Hantuchová in the 2011 Fed Cup, but retired in her second rubber against Jana Čepelová. Her next tournament was the Open GDF Suez, where she fell to a resurgent Jelena Dokić in the first round. A week later at the Dubai Tennis Championships, she again exited in the first round by losing to Klára Zakopalová. Her performance at the Qatar Ladies Open was more positive, as she defeated world No. 10 Agnieszka Radwańska in two sets, before losing in three sets in the second round to Flavia Pennetta. She had her best result in 2011 at the Malaysian Open, where she reached the final against an in-form Jelena Dokić. She held two championship points in the second-set tiebreaker, but was unable to convert either chance and succumbed in three sets. She reached the second round in Indian Wells by beating Kristina Barrois, while serving a WTA season-high 18 aces, before losing a close match to 21st seed Andrea Petkovic. The following week as the 31st seed, she had a bye in round one of the Miami Masters. She then defeated Patty Schnyder and lost to fourth seed Sam Stosur.\n\nŠafářová was forced to pull out of the Czech Fed Cup tie against Belgium the following week due to a left thigh problem. She attempted to play at Stuttgart, but lost to Barrois. She pulled out of Barcelona with the same leg injury. Her next tournament was the Premier Madrid event. She defeated Spanish player Anabel Medina Garrigues by coming back from match point down in the third set. She followed this victory with a three-set win over seventh seed Jelena Janković in round two and a two-set win over Jarmila Gajdošová in round three. These victories meant that for the second consecutive year, she had made the quarterfinals in Madrid. In the quarterfinals, she lost a hard-fought match to fourth seed Victoria Azarenka in three sets. In Rome the following week, she began with a win over Kimiko Date-Krumm. In the second round, she fell to Jelena Janković.\n\nUnseeded at the French Open, Šafářová opened with an easy win over Kirsten Flipkens. In round two, she was up a set and a break against 17th seeded German Julia Görges, but eventually succumbed in three sets. In the doubles event, she and Michaëlla Krajicek opened with a win over Miami champions Radwańska and Hantuchová, and then defeated Pauline Parmentier and Kristina Mladenovic before falling to fifth-seeded Madrid Champions Victoria Azarenka and Maria Kirilenko. Reaching the third round marked her best doubles result at the French Open up to that point in her career.\n\nAs the fourth seed in Copenhagen, Šafářová made a series of tough three-set wins by never winning the first set. However, after beating Johanna Konta, Michaëlla Krajicek, Zhang Shuai, and Petra Martić (after trailing by a set and 4–0), she lost the final to home favourite and world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki. She then traveled to Eastbourne, where she lost in the opening round to eventual champion Marion Bartoli despite holding a match point.\n\nAt Wimbledon, Šafářová was seeded 31st. She defeated fellow Czech Lucie Hradecká in the first round in three sete. This victory was her first win at Wimbledon since 2007.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Šafářová competed in the women's singles and the women's doubles, but lost in the first round of both competitions. She reached the semifinals of the Rogers Cup in Montreal, where she lost to Li Na in three sets. With this result, she was ranked well within the top 20 for the first time in her career. In 2012, she also helped the Czech team defend its Fed Cup title. She won both her singles matches against Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Janković in the final against Serbia. Her victory against Janković clinched a 3–1 victory for the Czechs.\n\nIn 2013, Šafářová did not advance past the second round at any of the Grand Slams in singles. She was more successful in doubles. Partnering with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, they reached the quarterfinals at both the Australian Open and the French Open. The week following the US Open, Šafářová won her fifth WTA singles title at the Challenge Bell.\n\nŠafářová had a match point in the third round of the Australian Open against Li Na, but was eventually beaten in three sets as Li went on to win her second major title.

At the Australian Open, she suffered another first-round exit to Yaroslava Shvedova. Despite the early loss in singles, she rebounded by capturing her first Grand Slam title in doubles. Partnering with American Bethanie Mattek-Sands, they defeated the 14th seeded team of Chan Yung-jan and Zheng Jie.\nŠafářová then played at the Diamond Games and lost in the quarterfinals to fellow countrywoman Karolína Plíšková. She next traveled to Dubai where she made it to the quarterfinals by upsetting defending champion Venus Williams along the way. However, in the quarterfinals she lost again to Plíšková. At the Qatar Total Open, she defeated former Grand Slam champion Samantha Stosur, fifth seed Ekaterina Makarova, sixth seed Andrea Petkovic, and ninth seed Carla Suárez Navarro en route to her first final in over a year.

It was Sharapova's earliest French Open loss since 2010. In the quarterfinals, she played the 21st seed Garbiñe Muguruza and won in straight sets to advance to her second semifinal in a Grand Slam. With her quarterfinal win, she secured her place in the top 10. She then defeated former champion Ana Ivanovic in two tight sets to advance to her first ever Grand Slam final, which she lost to Serena Williams in three sets. In doubles she and Mattek-Sands claimed their second Grand Slam title of the year by beating Yaroslava Shvedova and Casey Dellacqua in three sets in the final.

He was murdered in the Theresienstadt concentration camp.\n\nBorn in Pressburg, Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire (now Bratislava, Slovakia), he began studying mathematics at Vienna University in 1884, obtained his Ph.D. in 1889, and his habilitation in 1891.\nStarting from 1892, he worked as chief mathematician at the Phönix insurance company until 1908, when he became an a.o. professor at the University of Vienna, though, already from 1901, he had been honorary professor at TU Vienna and director of its insurance mathematics chair. In 1933, he was awarded the Grand Decoration of Honour in Silver for Services to the Republic of Austria, and retired as emeritus extraordinary professor. However, he continued lecturing as a privatdozent until 1938, when he was forced to resign as a consequence of the \"Anschluss\". On 28–29 June 1942, he was deported with transport IV/2, č. 621 to Theresienstadt, where he was murdered on 26 July 1942.\n\n list 35 publications in the bibliography appended to his obituary, and also a search performed on the \"Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik\" database results in a list 35 mathematical works authored by him, spanning a period of time from 1891 to 1940. However, cites two papers on actuarial mathematics which do not appear in these two bibliographical lists and Binder's bibliography of Tauber's works (1984, pp. 163–166), while listing 71 entries including the ones in the bibliography of and the two cited by Hlawka, does not includes the short note so the exact number of his works is not known. According to , his scientific research can be divided into three areas: the first one comprises his work on the theory of functions of a complex variable and on potential theory, the second one includes works on linear differential equations and on the Gamma function, while the last one includes his contributions to actuarial science. give a more detailed list of research topics Tauber worked on, though it is restricted to mathematical analysis and geometric topics: some of them are infinite series, Fourier series, spherical harmonics, the theory of quaternions, analytic and descriptive geometry. Tauber's most important scientific contributions belong to the first of his research areas, even if his work on potential theory has been overshadowed by the one of Aleksandr Lyapunov.\n\nHis most important article is . In this paper, he succeeded in proving a converse to Abel's theorem for the first time: this result was the starting point of numerous investigations, leading to the proof and to applications of several theorems of such kind for various summability methods. The statement of these theorems has a standard structure: if a series is summable according to a given summability method and satisfies an additional condition, called \"\"Tauberian condition\"\", then it is a convergent series. Starting from 1913 onward, G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood used the term \"Tauberian\" to identify this class of theorems. Describing with a little more detail Tauber's 1897 work, it can be said that his main achievements are the following two theorems:\n\nThis theorem is, according to , the forerunner of all Tauberian theory: the condition is the first Tauberian condition, which later had many profound generalizations. In the remaining part of his paper, by using the theorem above, Tauber proved the following, more general result:\n\n\nThis result is not a trivial consequence of . The greater generality of this result with respect to the former one is due to the fact it proves the exact equivalence between ordinary convergence on one side and Abel summability (condition 1) jointly with Tauberian condition (condition 2) on the other. claims that this latter result must have appeared to Tauber much more complete and satisfying respect to the as it states a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of a series while the former one was simply a stepping stone to it: the only reason why Tauber's second theorem is not mentioned very often seems to be that it has no profound generalization as the first one has, though it has its rightful place in all detailed developments of summability of series.\n\n writes that Tauber contributed at an early stage to theory of the now called \"Hilbert transform\", anticipating with his contribution the works of Hilbert and Hardy in such a way that the transform should perhaps bear their three names. Precisely, considers the real part and imaginary part of a power series ,\n\nwhere\n\nUnder the hypothesis that is less than the convergence radius of the power series , Tauber proves that and satisfy the two following equations:\n\nAssuming then , he is also able to prove that the above equations still hold if and are only absolutely integrable: this result is equivalent to defining the Hilbert transform on the circle since, after some calculations exploiting the periodicity of the functions involved, it can be proved that and are equivalent to the following pair of Hilbert transforms:\nFinally, it is perhaps worth pointing out an application of the results of , given (without proof) by Tauber himself in the short research announce : \n\n\n\n\n"}

The speakers are one of six Maroon peoples (formerly called \"Bush Negroes\") in the Republic of Suriname and one of the Maroon peoples in French Guiana. Most of the 25 to 30 thousand speakers live in the interior of the country, which is a part of the country covered with tropical rainforests. Ethnologue lists two related languages under the name \"Ndyuka\".\n\nNdyuka is based on English vocabulary, with influence from African languages in its grammar and sounds. For example, the difference between \"na\" (\"is\") and \"ná\" (\"isn't\") is tone; words can start with consonants such as \"mb\" and \"ng\", and some speakers use the consonants \"kp\" and \"gb\". (For other Ndyuka speakers, these are pronounced \"kw\" and \"gw\", respectively. For example, the word \"to leave\" is \"gwé\" or \"gbé\", from English \"go away\".) There are also influences from Portuguese and other languages.\n\nModern orthography differs from an older Dutch-based orthography in substituting \"u\" for \"oe\" and \"y\" for \"j\". The digraphs \"ty\" and \"dy\" are pronounced somewhat like the English \"ch\" and \"j\", respectively. Tone is infrequently written, but it is required for words such as \"ná\" (\"isn't\"). The syllabic Afaka script was devised for Ndyuka in 1908.\n\nThe Ndyuka language has three dialects: proper Ndyuka (or \"Okanisi\"), Aluku, and Paramaccan, which are ethnically distinct.\n\nKwinti is distinct enough linguistically to be considered a separate language, but it is sometimes included as well under the name \"Ndyuka\".\n\nNdyuka was also a basis of the Ndyuka-Tiriyó Pidgin.\n\nHere is an example of Ndyuka text, and its translation into English (showing the similitarities as well as the lexical evolution), adapted from \"Languages of the Guianas (SIL Publications)\":\n\nThe language bears some similarity to Twi and other Akan languages spoken by the Akan people of Ghana.\n\n\n"}

He also served a term as Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy.\n\nA native of Lyons, New York, Brownson graduated from the Naval Academy in 1865. He served in the North Atlantic Squadron until 1868, when he was assigned to the Pacific Squadron. In 1870, during his tour of duty on the steam sloop-of-war , Brownson and a detachment of men fought the Battle of Boca Teacapan against the pirate ship \"Forward\" in Mexican waters. During the fighting, United States Marines and U.S. Navy sailors captured the enemy ship and defeated a superior force of pirates positioned at a shore battery.\n\nIn 1872, Brownson reported for duty at the Naval Academy's Department of Mathematics. Three years later, he was sent as a young lieutenant to the Asiatic Station. Brownson returned to the Naval Academy in 1878 as Assistant Commandant of Cadets. In 1881, he was ordered to the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey as a lieutenant commander, where he commanded the survey ship USC&GS \"George S. Blake\" until 1884. After brief duty as executive officer of the steam frigate , he was named Inspector of Hydrography for the Coast Survey.\n\nAfter a return to the Naval Academy as Commandant of Cadets, Brownson served for two years on the Board of Inspection and Survey. He commanded the auxiliary cruiser during the Spanish–American War of 1898, seeing action in the Battle of Guantánamo Bay.\n\nIn 1899 Brownson achieved the rank of captain and command of the battleship , and from 1902 to 1905 was Superintendent of the Naval Academy.\nBrownson was promoted to rear admiral in 1905, when he hoisted his flag on board the armored cruiser as Commander, 4th Division, North Atlantic Fleet. He served as Commander, Special Service Squadron in Central American waters and was Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet from 15 October 1906 to 31 March 1907.\n\nIn 1907, Brownson was assigned as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, which handled the U.S. Navys personnel matters. In July 1907, he was transferred to the retired list, but continued to serve in his post at the Bureau of Navigation until December 1907. That month, President Theodore Roosevelt decided to give command of hospital ships to U.S. Navy doctors, against the advice of Brownson, who then resigned from the Navy. A storm of protest arose from within the Navy and from the public, but Brownsons active naval career was over.\n\nBrownson married Isabella Robinson Roberts in July 1872. Their first child, Henry was born in 1874 and died in 1876 shortly after his father left for the Asiatic Station. The following spring his daughter Harriet was born. In 1878 another son, Roswell, was born and in 1894 a second daughter, Caroline Robinson, was born. Caroline Brownson married Thomas C.

In county cricket, he played for Lancashire throughout his career.\n\nAs a batsman, Martin was capable of contributing runs from the lower order, and was competent enough to record two first-class centuries for Lancashire. By a statistical anomaly Martin topped the List A batting averages in 1996. He scored 78 runs in 12 innings, but was not out in 11 of these, so giving him a season's average of 78.00 despite a top score of just 35*. He continued to play for Lancashire until his retirement from cricket in 2004.\n\nIn 1995, he was called up to the England squad for their ODI series against West Indies, and he claimed figures of 4/44 on his debut. His success in that series earned him a place on the Test team to play the West Indies that year. He was named in the touring party for the England tour to South Africa later that year, and was also part of the England squad for the 1996 Cricket World Cup.\n\nAfter 1996, he did not play many more matches for England with his last appearance coming in the 1998 ICC Knock Out tournament.\n\n"}

It was produced by Thomas Fehlmann (of The Orb) and Gareth Jones.\n\nAn overtly experimental and introspective album, \"Erasure\" contains eleven, mostly mid-tempo tracks that differed from their past output of shiny, three-minute pop songs. Most tracks clocked in at five minutes or more, several contained long synth interludes, and guest artists included the London Community Gospel Choir and performance artist Diamanda Galás.\n\nAlthough appreciated for its experimental nature, \"Erasure\" marked the beginning of Erasure's slide from the peak of their popularity in the mainstream music world. Coming off four consecutive number-one albums in the UK, this album failed to hit the top ten and two single releases also missed the UK top ten. After a successful top twenty debut on the \"Billboard\" 200 for their previous album \"I Say I Say I Say\", \"Erasure\" debuted and peaked at number eighty-two in the U.S. and generated no Hot 100 singles. In Germany the album also peaked lower than previous albums, at number eighty-seven.\n\nSome polls have shown this album to be a favourite among fans of the band.\n\nIn an interview with DJ Ron Slomowicz circa 2006, Erasure was asked for their favourite album from their own catalogue. Bell stated \"\"It's a toss-up between \"Chorus\" and the self-titled \"Erasure\" album from 1995.\"\"\n\nSubsequent to their acquisition of Erasure's back catalog, and in anticipation of the band's 30th anniversary, BMG commissioned reissues of all previously released UK editions of Erasure albums up to and including 2007's \"Light at the End of the World\". All titles were pressed and distributed by Play It Again Sam on 180-gram vinyl and shrinkwrapped with a custom anniversary sticker.\n\n\n"}

He took charge of all British troops in Georgia in May 1780 and was then deployed to Philadelphia to supervise the evacuation of British prisoners of war at the closing stages of the American Revolutionary War. He went on to be Governor of Jamaica and then lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada in which role he had responsibility for implementing the Constitutional Act 1791. He was then sent to India where he became Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Army, then briefly Governor-General of India and finally Commander-in-Chief of India during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War.\n\nBorn the son of Charles Clarke (c.1702–1750) and Jane Clarke (née Mullins), Alured Clarke was educated at Eton College and was commissioned as an ensign in the 50th Regiment of Foot on 20 March 1759. Later that year he served in Germany under the Marquess of Granby. Promoted to lieutenant in the 50th Regiment of Foot on 10 May 1760 and to captain in the 52nd Regiment of Foot on 30 December 1763, he transferred to the 5th Regiment of Foot, stationed in Ireland, in January 1767 and was then promoted to major in the 54th Regiment of Foot in 1771.\n\nPromoted to lieutenant-colonel and given the command of the 7th Regiment of Foot, serving in America, on 13 May 1777, Clarke took charge of all British troops in Georgia in May 1780 and, having been promoted to colonel on 16 May 1782, he was then deployed to Philadelphia to supervise the evacuation of British prisoners of war in May 1783.\n\nClarke became Governor of Jamaica in Summer 1784. Promoted to major-general on 1 May 1790, he acquitted himself well enough as Governor of Jamaica that he was recommended to King George III as a suitable person to become lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada in October 1790. In the absence of the Governor, who had departed for England in August 1791, he took command of British forces and set about implementing the Constitutional Act 1791 which involved settling geographical boundaries (between Lower Canada and the United States and between Lower Canada and the rest of Canada), offering land to settlers and convening the first legislature of the Province. Clarke served as lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada until Summer 1793, when the Governor returned to Canada and Clarke could return to England.\n\nClarke was sent to India in 1795 with instructions to interrupt his voyage at the Cape of Good Hope where he and his force defeated a Dutch army at Wynberg on 16 September 1795 and then spent the next two months on arranging administrative matters before proceeding to India. On arrival in India in early 1796 he became Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Army. He was promoted to the local rank of lieutenant-general on 3 May 1796 and, having been appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath on 14 January 1797, he was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-general on 4 February 1797. He became acting Governor-General of India in March 1798 (in which capacity he also served as acting Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army) and then became Commander-in-Chief, India in May 1798. Although Clarke was not present at the Siege of Seringapatam in April 1799, his army was victorious thereby successfully concluding the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. He returned to England in March 1801 and was promoted to full general on 11 May 1802. Following a re-organisation of the order, he was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 4 January 1815.\n\nClarke also served as honorary colonel of 1st Battalion 60th Royal American Regiment, of the 68th Regiment of Foot, of the 5th Regiment of Foot and then of the 7th Regiment of Foot. \n\nIn retirement Clarke lived at Mansfield Street in London. He was promoted to field marshal on the occasion of the coronation of King William IV on 22 July 1830. He died at Llangollen in Wales on 16 September 1832 while visiting his niece.\n\nClarke married Elizabeth Catherine (Kitty) Hunter in 1770, who eight years earlier had eloped with the married Earl of Pembroke. Kitty had a son by Pembroke, and received a pension from him until 1790, but Clarke and she had no children.\n\n \n"}

At the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 he commanded the 17th half-flotilla of the IX. Torpedo-boat Flotilla; his flagship, SMS V27 was sunk in action. Later in the war he was involved in action in the southern North Sea and Dover Straits. By the war's end he was commander of the IX. Torpedo-boat Flotilla, which he led into internment at Scapa Flow in November 1918, returning to Germany with the majority of his crew shortly thereafter.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the German Empire, Ehrhardt formed the II.Marine Brigade. A strong opponent of the Treaty of Versailles, he held strong monarchist views. The II.Marine Brigade was a force of around 6,000 men. They fought in north-west Germany, central Germany, Upper Silesia, and Bavaria and participated in the unsuccessful Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch of 1920. After the failed Putsch, Ehrhardt fled Germany, returning at a later time. In Bavaria, which was ruled by Gustav von Kahr at that time, he formed the Organisation Consul, and later the Viking League (\"Bund Wiking\"), a secret military society.\n\nThree years later during the Beer Hall Putsch, Ehrhardt and his deputy commander Eberhard Kautter refused to help Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party. Ehrhardt later contested for leadership with Hitler, but he was unsuccessful, with most of Ehrhardt's men joining the Nazi Party. He became involved in attempts to destabilise the Nazis as a result and worked behind the scenes to forge an alliance between dissident Sturmabteilung leader Walter Stennes and Black Front leader Otto Strasser. Ultimately the initiative was not a success as Strasser abandoned Stennes when he learned that the reactionary Ehrhardt was behind the plan to link the two leaders.\n\nEhrhardt was one of those listed to be killed during the Night of the Long Knives, but he managed to escape to Austria. He was later invited back to Nazi Germany. He died in 1971 in Brunn am Walde, Lower Austria.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "2062407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062407", "title": "Limes Germanicus", "text": "Limes Germanicus\n\nThe Limes Germanicus (Latin for \"Germanic frontier\") is the name given in modern times to a line of frontier (\"limes\") fortifications that bounded the ancient Roman provinces of Germania Inferior, Germania Superior and Raetia, dividing the Roman Empire and the unsubdued Germanic tribes from the years 83 to about 260 AD. The Limes used either a natural boundary such as a river or typically an earth bank and ditch with a wooden palisade and watchtowers at intervals. A system of linked forts was built behind the Limes.\n\nThe path of the limes changed over time following advances and retreats due to pressure from external threats. At its height, the Limes Germanicus stretched from the North Sea outlet of the Rhine to near Regensburg (Castra Regina) on the Danube. These two major rivers afforded natural protection from mass incursions into imperial territory, with the exception of a gap stretching roughly from \"Mogontiacum\" (Mainz) on the Rhine to Castra Regina.\n\nThe Limes Germanicus was divided into:\n\n\nThe total length was . It included at least 60 forts and 900 watchtowers. The potentially weakest, hence most heavily guarded, part of the \"Limes\" was the aforementioned gap between the westward bend of the Rhine at modern-day Mainz and the main flow of the Danube at Regensburg. This 300-km wide land corridor between the two great rivers permitted movement of large groups of people without the need for water transport, hence the heavy concentration of forts and towers there, arranged in depth and in multiple layers along waterways, fords, roads, and hilltops.\n\nRoman border defences have become much better known through systematic excavations financed by Germany and through other research connected to them. In 2005, the remnants of the Upper Germanic & Rhaetian Limes were inscribed on the List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as \"Frontiers of the Roman Empire,\" with lower Limes being placed on the tentative list in 2011, aiming to extend the world heritage site to the whole limes. The Saalburg is a reconstructed fortification and museum of the Limes near Frankfurt.\n\nThe first emperor who began to build fortifications along the border was Augustus, shortly after the devastating Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. Originally there were numerous Limes walls, which were then connected to form the Upper Germanic Limes along the Rhine and the Rhaetian Limes along the Danube. Later these two walls were linked to form a common borderline.\n\nFrom the death of Augustus (14 AD) until after 70 AD, Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg. The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards. The motives alike of geographical convenience and of the advantages to be gained by recognising these movements of Roman subjects combined to urge a forward policy at Rome, and when the vigorous Vespasian had succeeded Nero, a series of advances began which gradually closed up the acute angle, or at least rendered it obtuse.\n\nThe first advance came about 74 AD, when what is now Baden was invaded and partly annexed and a road carried from the Roman base on the upper Rhine, Straßburg, to the Danube just above Ulm. The point of the angle was broken off.\n\nThe second advance was made by Domitian about 83 AD. He pushed out from Moguntiacum, extended the Roman territory east of it and enclosed the whole within a systematically delimited and defended frontier with numerous blockhouses along it and larger forts in the rear. Among the blockhouses was one which by various enlargements and refoundations grew into the well-known Saalburg fort on the Taunus near Bad Homburg. This advance necessitated a third movement, the construction of a frontier connecting the annexations of AD 74 and AD 83 . We know the line of this frontier which ran from the Main across the upland Odenwald to the upper waters of the Neckar and was defended by a chain of forts. We do not, however, know its date, save that, if not Domitian's work, it was carried out soon after his death, and the whole frontier thus constituted was reorganised, probably by Hadrian, with a continuous wooden palisade reaching from Rhine to Danube.\n\nThe angle between the rivers was now almost full. But there remained further advance and further fortification. Either Hadrian or, more probably, his successor Antoninus Pius pushed out from the Odenwald and the Danube, and marked out a new frontier roughly parallel to, but in advance of these two lines, though sometimes, as on the Taunus, coinciding with the older line. This is the frontier which is now visible and visited by the curious. It consists, as we see it today, of two distinct frontier works, one, known as the Pfahlgraben, is a palisade of stakes with a ditch and earthen mound behind it, best seen in the neighbourhood of the Saalburg but once extending from the Rhine southwards into southern Germany. The other, which begins where the earthwork stops, is a wall, though not a very formidable wall, of stone, the Teufelsmauer; it runs roughly east and west parallel to the Danube, which it finally joins at Heinheim near Regensburg. The southern part of the Pfahlgraben is remarkably straight; for over 50 km it points almost absolutely true for Polaris.\n\nThis frontier remained for about 100 years, and no doubt in that long period much was done to it to which precise dates are difficult to fix. It cannot even be absolutely certain when the frontier laid out by Pius was equipped with the manpitts and other special fortifications. But we know that the pressure of the barbarians began to be felt seriously in the later part of the 2nd century, and after long struggles the whole or almost the whole district east of the Rhine and north of the Danube was lost, seemingly all within one short period, about 250.\n\nGermanic invasions in the late 3rd century led to the abandonment of the so-called \"Upper Raetian Limes\" in favour of a Roman defence line along the rivers Rhine, Iller and Danube (Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes). Support was provided to some degree by fast river boats, the navis lusoria being the standard type, that could reach outposts or points of crisis quickly. Watch towers were in sight contact and heavily fortified castra placed at important passes (e.g. Castrum Rauracense instead of the previously unwalled Augusta Raurica near to Basel) and in the hinterland of the frontier (e.g. Vindonissa in today's Switzerland).\n\nThe limes itself is a relatively simple construction. It is similar to the fortification that a travelling troop of Roman soldiers would construct every evening to protect their camp from attacks. On the outside, the soldiers dug a ditch. The earth from the ditch was used to build a mound. On top of the mound stakes were attached. The Limes had a deeper ditch and a higher mound. The stakes were higher too and in front of the ditch while on several parts of the limes, instead of stakes there was a simple stone wall.\n\nBehind the wall/mound a system of control towers, built of wood or stone, was installed, each within sight of the next one, and usually able also to signal to the forts several kilometers to the rear.\nThe limes was never able to prevent whole Germanic tribes from entering the territory of the Roman Empire. This was not the intention of the builders. Near the watch towers, the limes was open to passage, especially by traders or persons coming to live or work within the Empire, the purpose of the limes was control of this traffic. To cross the limes it was necessary to pass the towers, and so come to the notice of the garrison, or try to climb or destroy the wall and the stakes. Only individuals or small groups could climb the obstacles without being noticed, and they could not drive much stolen livestock with them. Large groups would be noticed, they could destroy one or several towers, but this also would come to the attention of the Romans. This knowledge of all traffic crossing the border was crucial to the Roman military. For a territory as large as the Roman Empire, there were amazingly few soldiers, almost all of the legions were based close to the frontiers, any hostile band that managed to pass this outer area of defense could travel within the Empire without much resistance. The purpose of the limes was as an early warning system, deterrence of casual small-scale raiding, and the ability to counteract while the enemy was still near the border fortresses and garrisons. Other researchers believe the limes may have been a bulwark to control the movement of groups of people, comparing it to the fence system along the American-Mexican border.\n\nThe Netherlands:\nGermany:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2062410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062410", "title": "Show of Hands", "text": "Show of Hands\n\nShow of Hands are an English acoustic roots/folk duo formed in 1986 by singer-songwriter Steve Knightley (guitars, mandolin, mandocello, cuatro) and composer and multi-instrumentalist Phil Beer (vocals, guitars, violin, viola, mandolin, mandocello). Joined by singer and double-bassist Miranda Sykes for a tour in 2004, Show of Hands continued to regularly perform as a trio with Sykes, as well as in their original format. In 2019 the line-up was further expanded by the addition of Irish percussionist Cormac Byrne.\n\nKnown for their songs with rousing choruses that address contemporary social issues, (notably their \"singalong attack on the bankers\", Arrogance Ignorance and Greed) these often illustrate current concerns through historical narratives and have earned Knightley the label the 'Gravel voiced spokesman of the rural poor'. Rooted in English traditional music the songs are shot through with diverse influences from music across the world, including the blues, Americana and Latin rhythms. Nominating Knightley as 'songwriter of the '90s' Tom Robinson of BBC Radio 6 noted that the songs spring from \"the soil of the West Country,\" where, as Robin Denselow writes in the Guardian, \"Beer and Knightley have become folk heroes\".\n\nWidely recognised as pioneers in the folk/roots arena both for their enduring emphasis on stagecraft, and their radical business model, Show of Hands are noted for the high level of professionalism they bring to their performances whether in a small club or the Royal Albert Hall. Their \"much vaunted cottage industry,\" set up Show of Hands as an independent concern before the internet made this common practice. Beer and Knightley with their then manager Gerard O'Farrell built on their close relationship with their growing and \"devoted\" fanbase to create a completely self-contained way of working. \nThis included their record label and production company Hands On Music, that gave them control of their consistently 'classy' output.\n\nShow of Hands have received widespread critical acclaim over their 30 album (and continuing) career, and in 2006 were voted \"Greatest Devonians Ever\" in a poll run by Devon Country Council beating Sir Francis Drake, Agatha Christie and Chris Martin amongst others to the title.\n\n1980s: The beginning\n\nOffered a gig at the Wimborne Festival in 1986, Steve Knightley called on his old friends Warwick Downes (double bass) and Martin Bradley (concertina) to join him for that event. They performed as Show of Hands, a name chosen by Knightley who liked its democratic implications. Another of Knightley’s old friends, Phil Beer, was in the audience. Impressed by the quality of Knightley’s self-penned songs and by Exile in particular, Beer suggested they form a duo and offered to try and get them some gigs.\n\nThe pair had first met in the early seventies when both were in their early teens and performing on the thriving Devon folk circuit. Beer was gigging extensively with Colin Wilson (guitar) in their duo 'Odd Folk'. Knightley, in 'Gawain', was working his way through the Penguin Book of English Folk Songs, with Paul Downes (Warwick’s brother) on guitar and John 'Bat' Evans on fiddle. At this time Knightley began experimenting with writing his own songs.\n\nRelocating to Coventry to study politics and history at Lanchester Polytechnic Knightley started a folk club there. Beer and Downes, gigging as a duo were frequent visitors.\nContinuing his studies at Sussex University, Knightley formed a duo with Warwick Downes, during which time he penned his narrative folk 'opera' Tall Ships. This he later performed on Richard Digance's Capital Radio show, with his then neighbour, the actor Jim Carter (\"Downton Abbey\"'s Mr. Carson) reading the opening poem, 'The Wrecker’s Prayer'.\n\nThroughout the late '70s and early '80s Beer and Knightley would stand in as needed in each other's bands when they were playing in London. Here Knightley \"stormed the indie rock circuit\" In four bands The Cheats', 'Total Strangers', 'Short Stories' and 'The West' and Beer gigged with folk legends Johnny Coppin, Ashley Hutchings’ The Albion Band, Mike Oldfield and his own 'The Arizona Smoke Revue'.\n\nIn 1986 Knightley moved to rural Dorset with his first wife Simone to run the remote 'Catsley House' as a whole-food guest-house. Here, in January 1987, following their fateful Wimborne Festival meeting, Beer and Knightley set up in a studio above the garage to record the songs that as Show of Hands they were now honing live.\n\nTheir first release, Show of Hands (on cassette only), sold out over the course of their live shows. Playing every gig on the folk circuit they knew so well from their teenage years, they realised that audiences tend to favour familiarity over novelty. So the pair initially slipped original songs into a set of folk standards. But by the end of the decade the folk standards barely featured in their shows. This is testimony to Knightley’s ability to write original songs that become instant classics. For instance, The Galway Farmer has appeared in at least one list of traditional Irish tunes though Knightley wrote it in 1994.\n\n1990s: Sowing the seeds of a 'grass-roots' phenomenon\n\nShow of Hands kicked off the '90s with the release of Tall Ships. Again on cassette only and recorded at the Catsley House home studio, it featured the recording of Knightley’s epic folk-suite that had first aired on Capital Radio. This too sold out at gigs.\n\nTaken on in 1991 by local agent Peter Wilson, he secured bookings for the duo in hundreds of venues up and down the South Coast. Here in the dockers' and bikers' pubs Show of Hands learnt how to successfully compete with the darts and the TV to grow a loyal audience beyond their usual folk crowd.\n\nKnightley’s years performing in tough London pubs and bars and Beer’s folk/rock experience of venues throughout Europe began to pay off. \"We were playing loud and hard. People would still be clapping and we’d be already counting in the next tune. Sometimes we’d have to tone it down a touch in the folk clubs, but it was great grounding for festival gigs.\" 'Nailing it' live, Show of Hands were building firm foundations for their famously close relationship with their audience as the '90s dawned. And in 1991, as their gigging schedule became increasingly hectic, Beer left ‘The Albion Band’ to concentrate full-time on Show of Hands.\n\nOut for the Count, also on cassette, followed the same year. Recorded at Beer’s Old Court Studio in Gloucestershire, it again quickly sold out at gigs.\nDisplaying their trust in the people who came to see them, Show of Hands would simply put the cassettes in a tub and say: \"If you’d like one, take one, but bung in a fiver.\"\n\nEarly collaboration\n\nA chance call from Roger Watson from the Southern Arts Development Project (TAPS) in 1992 resulted in Beer and Knightley’s collaboration with three exiled Chilean Musicians. Together with Dave Townsend on fiddle and concertina, they joined Sergio Avila, Mauricio Venegas and Vladimir Vega to create the band 'Alianza'.\n\nWorking with the Chileans on the 'Alianza' tour and album of the same name had a profound impact on Beer and Knightley. Whilst informing their rhythmic language and musical sensibility, it also inspired them to add the cuatro to their repertoire. The Chileans' awareness of music’s power to educate and inform (and the risks that they took to perform it), hit home with Beer and Knightley. \"In our society people can make political statements in song and no one will threaten you. But for them, just getting together and playing ordinary folk songs (meant) risking arrest, imprisonment and exile.\"\n\nFirst CD releases\n\nBeer and Knightley continued performing as Show of Hands whilst also touring with 'Alianza' and in June 1992 their performance at the Bull’s Head in Bridport was recorded live by Mike Trim who'd signed the duo to his RGF record label. Show of Hands Live '92 was their first CD release. It secured them slots on the following year’s festival circuit and a 60-date tour support with Ralph McTell.\n\nWhere the 'Alianza' tour had introduced Beer and Knightley to arts centre audiences in the South of England, the gigs with McTell took them to large theatre audiences across the country. McTell advised them to \"stop doing endless gigs,\" to group them into coherent touring periods underpinned by a concept – and with a new record to promote!\n\nIn January 1994, Show of Hands recorded Beat About the Bush (Isis records 1994, Hands On Music 1999), in Wytherstone Studios, West Dorset, again produced by Mike Trim. Released in February, the album featured a large line-up of guest musicians, including a rhythm section that the prevailing wisdom deemed necessary for a more radio friendly sound.\n\nA new business model\n\nThe Beat About The Bush tour took in over a hundred gigs from Land’s End to the Scottish Borders. Halfway through, Australian maverick and musician Gerard O’Farrell joined as sound engineer. Realising that the normal music business practice involving agents, fixed fees and using house PAs at each gig wasn't doing the band or the venues any favours, O’Farrell took up the reins as manager and agent. With Beer and Knightley he set up a new business model that was to become a template for musicians everywhere.\n\nShow of Hands would book the gigs in-house, turn up with their own PA and lighting system and even provide their own rider. They’d refuse a fee and instead take a percentage of the door. All the venue had to do was sell the tickets. In taking on the financial risk, Show of Hands avoided possibly antagonistic relationships with the venues and also empowered a host of music-loving amateur promoters, many of whom have built careers booking major artists in large concert venues.\n\nForming a close-knit expert touring team, they also removed the anxieties of potentially poor sound and inadequate lighting. Show of Hands would take typical folk performances to a new level, ensuring a professional performance scenario that both they and their audiences could rely on.\n\nAs the band continued to build up their grass-roots fan base and growing a mailing list that received news of their forthcoming gigs, their 'cottage industry' approach began to pay off.\nIn 1996, O’Farrell, Beer and Knightley set up the label 'Hands On Music', to take care of Show of Hands' recording, distribution and publishing needs. From the outset, O’Farrell and Hands On Music bucked the trend in usual music business practice by positively applauding music sharing in line with the available technology.\nA newsletter went out in 1997 encouraging the copying of albums onto cassette and handing them out to friends. Later, after a crash course to learn all things internet, O’Farrell set up the band’s website, made Show of Hands' music and footage freely available and gave downloading a hearty thumbs up.\n\nIn 2001 O’Farrell returned with his family to Australia where he continued to run the website. Vaughan Pearce, then in charge of the band’s merchandising, took on the role of manager. He would focus on the agency side of the business, whilst his wife Gwen, a former major record company executive, would soon join him to run the Hands On Music label. A deal with Proper in 2001 ensured mainstream distribution for Show of Hands releases.\n\nInternational gigs\n\nThroughout the '90s the duo performed in Australia, Hong Kong, the US, Canada, Indonesia and India – experiences that opened their ears to yet more instrumental textures and songwriting themes. Under Vaughan and Gwen’s steady stewardship the duo re-focused their attention on their British audiences and their festival and concert profile grew accordingly.\n\n\"A formidable partnership\"\n\n1994 saw the release of Show of Hands first compilation album. Favourite tracks from the first three cassettes were repackaged on CD: Backlog 1987–1991. (Isis 1994)\n\nDemonstrating their commitment to their audience and to music itself, Show of Hands embarked on their first 'workshop tour' in February 1995. In this they shared their experience of composing, performing and the music business with fans and fellow musicians alike.\n\nIn amongst festival gigs, and before performing to 18,000 at Copredy in August, Show of Hands recorded their next studio album Lie of the Land (Isis 1995, Hands On Music 1996). O’Farrell producing, plugged the instruments straight into the desk to capture a pared down 'live' sound. Released in October '95, the album received 4-stars and a 'startlingly good' from Q, becoming their folk record of the year in '96. \"Mojo\" said the album created \"a powerful, fresh sounding music with both integrity and widespread appeal\" whilst \"The Telegraph\" was moved to mention Show of Hands' \"formidable partnership\".\n\n\"Lie of the Land\"s album cover by Rob O’Connor beautifully underpinned the band’s connection with their rural roots whilst setting the bar high for the look of the growing Show of Hands 'brand'. An old friend from Knightley’s Coventry days, O’Connor had taken on the duo’s various design requirements since producing the artwork for their debut CD Show of Hands Live. O’Connor’s graphic design company 'Stylorouge' became world-famous for its award-winning work, and his design aesthetic espouses Show of Hands' reputation for high quality in every aspect of their output.\n\nSelling out the Royal Albert Hall\n\nDespite their increasing critical acclaim and burgeoning fan base, in the mid '90s Show of Hands were finding gigs in the capital hard to come by. With the help of software designer Richard Patterson and festival organiser Steve Heap their solution was to book The Royal Albert Hall for a gig on 24 March 1996. This secured them mainstream media coverage, including an interview on Richard and Judy’s morning TV show and news features on Sky news and BBC TV.\n\nAgainst the odds, (and the expectations of the RAH management), the show sold out. Show of Hands' fans turned up from all over the country. That year, Sue Morley and friends set up a formal fan club, with an internet forum 'Longdogs' (the name taken from the Show of Hands' song) following in 1998.\n\nAs of April 2017 when Show of Hands celebrated their 25th. anniversary at the Royal Albert Hall, the band has returned five times to the iconic London venue, (including on 8 April 2007, with their third performance there celebrating 15 years together), performing to sell-out crowds on each occasion. Each show at the RAH celebrates the previous five years of musical collaborations and features appearances from musician friends. Guests have included established names such as Ralph McTell, Johnnie Jones, Tom Robinson, Martyn Joseph and American singer-songwriter, Richard Shindell.\n\nThe Albert Hall shows have also given a platform to newcomers such as Jackie Oates, Phillip Henry & Hannah Martin, Jenna Witts and in 2001, making their first major public appearance, Port Isaac’s Fisherman’s Friends. Carlton Television filmed the 2001 show for a live music 'special' and Knightley proposed (to Clare, now his wife) from the stage. \n\nA recording of their debut RAH gig, Live at the Royal Albert Hall swiftly became their best-selling album to that date. It was released on CD in August '96 on Show of Hands' own Hands On Music.\n\nPaying it forward\nAs well as carrying on with sharing their music for free, Show of Hands also continue to share their expertise in workshop tours across the world and to give new acts a break by booking them as their supporting artists. By warmly introducing their guest artists themselves at each gig, and including them in a spot in their performance, Show of Hands aim to ensure that new artists are taken to heart by their audiences.\n\nTheir Five Days in May tour in '97 featured Kate Rusby on her first major solo venture. The tour culminated with a show at the Shepherds Bush Empire. Both separately and as Show of Hands Knightley and Beer continue to mentor and give touring opportunities to new artists, including Seth Lakeman, Jenna Witts, Jackie Oates, Megan Henwood, India Electric Company, Jim Causley, and Phillip Henry & Hannah Martin. Knightley has gone on to collaborate with Lakeman and their co-written Haunt You opened Show of Hands 2012 album, Wake the Union.\nThe end of the '90s\nFilming for a full-length feature documentary on Show of Hands began in February 97. Called 'Stairway to Devon' and directed by Rob O’Connor, it includes Show of Hands' appearance at Glastonbury that year.\n\nThe album \"Dark Fields\" was recorded in Cornwall and released in December '97, (Hands On Music) following Show of Hands' first single release Crazy Boy (Hands On Music), earlier in the Autumn. It featured songs by Knightley rooted in the area, including the notable Cornish diaspora anthem Cousin Jack – an 'instant classic'\nthat is now taught in schools throughout the Duchy and remains a popular live number.\n\nCelebrating the music that had inspired them in the first place, Show of Hands released \"Folk Music\" (Hands On Music) in 1998, an album of traditional songs and a reworking of Knightley’s composition The Train/Blackwater Side in traditional English style. That year also saw the debut of the band’s annual Abbotsbury Festival, a day featuring performances by Show of Hands and illustrious guest artists in the Dorset town’s lush Sub-Tropical Garden.\n\nRecognition and mainstream success\n\nAs the millennium dawned Show of Hands entered a particularly prolific recording period. First up was ’'Covers'’ (Hands On Music 2000), an album covering songs they loved from genres other than folk. Tracks from artists as diverse as Thom Yorke, Peter Gabriel, Lowell George and Bob Dylan are given a folk inspired nuance.\n\nNext, ‘'Cold Frontier'’, (Hands On Music) in 2001 shows Knightley’s 'deft hand' in confronting contemporary issues through historical narrative. Conveyed in memorable songs, such as ‘'The Flood'’ and the title track itself, his call to our common humanity is particularly effective. \"Cold Frontier\"was the first album to be recorded by Mick Dolan, who took responsibility for the Show of Hands sound after producer/manager Gerard O'Farrell returned to his native Australia. At the Cambridge Folk Festival that year, their CD sales outstripped those of every other artist.\n\n2002’s \"Cold Cuts\"(Hands On Music) features live performances of overlooked songs from Show of Hands' extensive back catalogue, all given new arrangements. Here their fresh approach is also applied to covers including Leonard Cohen’s ‘'First They Take Manhattan.'’\n\n\"The Path\", released in 2003 is Show of Hands' first instrumental album. Celebrating the silver jubilee of The South West Path, all the tracks are inspired by and relate to specific places along the famous coastal trail, creating an atmospheric musical portrait of each location. \"Country Life\" (Hands On Music) was released in October that same year.\n\nThe gravel-voiced spokesman of the rural poor\n\nKnightley’s talent for nailing social issues in song is razor-sharp on ‘'Country Life'’ (Hands On Music 2003). It was not just the title track \"an anthem on the bleak realities of rural England\" that exposed the harshness of local rural life and the album gained mainstream media acclaim – including from Andrew Marr. It landed Show of Hands a spot on BBC Five Live and Farming Today with Knightley becoming known as 'The gravel-voiced spokesman of the rural poor'. The seamless blend of folk, Latin, Celtic and subtle blues influences fuelled their tagline, 'world music from the West Country' and was labeled a revelation by Uncut magazine\n\nDouble bassist and singer Miranda Sykes joined Show of Hands for the ‘'Country Life'’ tour in the Autumn of 2004, featuring on the live double album this spawned – \"As You Were\"(Hands On Music). Released in 2005 it comprised 22 tracks recorded at various venues during the autumn tour. Knightley and Beer both assert that her outstanding contribution was transformative. They were no longer a 'blokey duo'. Sykes became the unofficial 'third member' of Show of Hands and from now on the band would perform as a trio as well as the original duo.\n\nNew musical practice\n\nDue to the demands of the bass, and the sonic possibilities of the third harmony provided by Sykes' \"almost ethereal\" and \"captivating\" vocals, Beer and Knightley changed the way they worked. They’d become used to Knightley pitching up with a song and improvising together as they worked on the arrangement during a sound-check. They would then take audience reactions into account as they honed the song during live performances. \"\n\nWith the bass rooting the chords and more complex vocal harmonies, the arrangements now had to be worked out beforehand. \"There had to be,\" say Beer and Knightley, \"less winging it and more structure\". Paradoxically both find that the clearly defined structure and the grounding that the bass provides liberates their musical improvisation. Released from having to root a song themselves – and knowing precisely where it's going – frees them to fully explore the musical possibilities in each moment.\n\nAs for the songwriting itself, Knightley sees his output as broadly falling into four categories, \"the emotional landscape American singer-songwriter approach, the up-tempo Irishy thing, the rural storytelling ballads and the big, angry, shouty sort of songs\". In September 2016 he set himself a 'song a week' challenge, writing one of each over the month, which included the new crowd favourite, ‘'Make The Right Noises.'’\n\nKnightley might be inspired by a sound, a phrase, a place, a rhythm or a melody he hears in his head. In true folk tradition he excels in writing songs that are rooted in place yet have universal resonance. Likewise his historical narratives and folk ballads bring history smack bang into the present with timeless contemporary meaning. Beer’s and later Sykes', brilliant musicality bring the themes to life, realising them in an almost filmic way.\n\nCo-writing\n\nKnightley has co-written a number of songs with long-time friend, pianist and producer Matt Clifford. Clifford’s close relationship with the Rolling Stones and Mick Jagger in particular led to Beer playing mandolin on the band’s Steel Wheels CD and to Knightley playing guitar and mandocello on Jagger’s 2001 solo outing ‘'Goddess in the Doorway'’. Knightley also co-wrote The Dohl Foundation’s 2017 single Mother Tongue with Johnny Kalsi (who also recorded with Show of Hands) and writes for folk/reggae band E2 and West Country rock band Willie and the Bandits. Show of Hands also collaborate with the English folk roots and reggae inspired band 'Edward ll.' (Previously known as Edward 2nd. and the Red Hot Polkas).\n\nAwards and nominations\nIn 2004, Show of Hands won the 'Best Live Act' award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, the only award voted for by the public.\n\nThe following year Show of Hands was nominated for 'Best Duo' whilst the title track on Country Life was nominated for 'Best Original Song'. They were also part of the Oysterband Big Session group that won the 'Best Group' award.\n\nAgain nominated for the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Best Duo in 2007, Roots (featured on their album Witness – Hands On Music 2006) was also nominated for Best Original song. Show of Hands was also nominated for Best Duo and Best Live Act in 2008.\n\n2009’s Arrogance, Ignorance and Greed (Hands On Music) won the award for 'Best Song' at the 2010 BBC2 Folk Awards, with Show of Hands winning 'Best Duo'.\n\nVoted 'Greatest Ever Devonians' in a 2006 competition run by Devon County Council, Show of Hands beat Sir Francis Drake, Agatha Christie, Captain Scott, Muse and Chris Martin amongst others to the title.\n\nWorld music from the West Country\n\nIt was at the Folk Awards that Beer and Knightley fell into conversation with musician/producer and Afro Celt Sound System co-founder Simon Emmerson. Emmerson and fellow Afro Celt Simon 'Mass' Massey subsequently brought their huge Afro Celt sample library into play as they produced \"Witness\"released in May 2006 (Hands On Music).\n\nWhilst warmly embracing the sensual African rhythms and the world and ambient music influences of the producers, Show of Hands' sound remains unmistakably their own. The world in their 'world music from the West Country' just got a little wider. Witness Show of Hands 9th. studio album was released to critical acclaim: \"Mojo\" gave the album four out of five stars, ranking Witness at number 10 on their best folk albums of 2006 list. Whilst music journalist Colin Irwin said that \"Steve Knightley's songs have developed such an edge that it's hard to deny them any longer\".\nBecoming the band’s best-selling album to date, Witness introduced Show of Hands to a new world music audience. The band went on to play at WOMAD in 2008 and a further 22 festivals that year. WOMAD founder Peter Gabriel called Show of Hands \"one of the great English bands\".\n\nControversy\n\nFeatured on Witness, Show of Hands' anthemic song Roots, was released as a single in 2008 (Hands On Music). A rousing riposte to Kim Howell’s 2001 remark \"the idea of listening to three Somerset folk singers sounds like hell\"(when Under Secretary of State for Culture and Sport), the song calls for a celebration of British culture in its diversity. However, it was misappropriated by the BNP. Beer and Knightley forced the BNP to stop using the track and helped to launch ‘'Folk Against Facism'’, giving ‘'Roots'’ to the movement’s eponymous 2010 double album. \"Roots\" also appeared on the compilation album \"The Best of British Folk\".\n\nRoots (Hands On Music) was also the title of their 2007 double album, the tracks on which were voted for by their fans.\n\nArrogance, Ignorance and Greed and mainstream success\n\nOn the title track of 2009’s Arrogance, Ignorance and Greed (Hands On Music 2009), Show of Hands gave voice to the public outrage with bankers and the ensuing crisis. \"You’re on your yacht/we’re on our knees/with your arrogance and ignorance and greed.\" With Megson’s Stuart Hanna producing, his pared-down post-punk aesthetic delivered on the raw immediacy of the album’s material.\n\nIf Country Life had flagged them up as an 'issues' band, AIG carried those colours slap bang into the mainstream. The accompanying guerrilla-filmed video features huge images of Beer, Knightley and Sykes performing the song projected high onto the edifices of the city’s banks whilst monkey-masked graffiti artists work Banksy style below. It 'went viral' on YouTube.\n\nBoth the award-winning title track and others from the album received widespread radio airplay, glowing reviews in the mainstream press (including 4 stars in the Financial Times from David Honigman) and landed Show of Hands a slot on the Andrew Marr Show.\n\nBack to Basics\n\nWhilst AIG garnered mainstream success, Show of Hands' core fans found they missed the familiar smooth production and the subtle metaphors with contemporary meaning in Knightley’s historical narratives. Show of Hands responded with Backlog 2 (Hands On Music) in 2011. The double album featured Show of Hands songs from 1991–2003 as voted for by their fans via the Longdogs forum. Recorded as if live, it had the immediacy and warmth of a Show of Hands gig. It followed on from 2010s \"Covers 2\" (Hands On Music) release. The album was credited to Show of Hands with Miranda Sykes, the first time Sykes received a leading album credit. Following the album's release, the band toured with Texan guitarist Rodney Branigan. 2010 also saw previously unreleased Show of Hands compositions mostly before 1987 on Beer's box set, \"Box Set One\".\n\n2014’s Centenary (Universal Music), featuring instrumental settings of World War 1 poetry, used instrumentation typical of the Edwardian period. Original commemorative songs by Show of Hands met their audience’s continuing demand for Knightley’s way with a narrative. Centenary entered the 'UK compilation album charts at no. 13 and received widespread acclaim in the mainstream media.\n\nTo mark the centenary of the Battle of the Somme, Show of Hands played Centenary live in Exeter Cathedral with Jim Carter and Imelda Staunton reading the poetry. The evening was recorded and released as Centenary Live at Exeter Cathedral in 2016 (Hands On Music).\n\nThe Long Way Home\n\n2016’s The Long Way Home sees a return of Beer and Knightley to their roots. Unlike 2012’s American roots inspired 'Wake the Union' described as \"where the A303 meets Route 66,\" The Long Way Home \"more Devonian than American\", barely detours from the A303. Both albums were produced by the band and long-time Show of Hands fellow traveller, Mark Tucker.\n\nPlaying live – And for charity\n\nWith the freedom afforded by their business model and a steadfastly loyal following, Show of Hands can and do play anywhere from village halls to festivals and concert hall bastions of culture. For example, in July 2008 Show of Hands played at the first folk proms concert in the Welsh Proms season in St Davids Hall, Cardiff and in the same month at the Evolve 08 festival in Lodmoor Park, Weymouth, along with Miranda Sykes. Knightley returned to the Trowbridge Village Pump Festival in July 2009 without Beer, due to Beer's sailing at the time. He played songs from his then-new solo album \"Track of Words – Retraced\". Show of Hands returned to the festival in July 2010 with both members.\nShips too also feature, from Show of Hands' performance on the upper deck of The Phoenix, a three-masted ship that sailed up to Topsham on the High Spring Tide in 2001, to gigs on a Rhine and Danube River Cruise in 2016 and 2017.\n\nWhether appearing as a duo or a trio, Show of Hands continue to feature guest musicians, many of whom guest on their recorded output, like long-term friend and Rolling Stones' session man, Matt Clifford, (keyboards, accordion) and their great friend and mentor Ralph McTell.\n\nTheir flexibility in playing live enables them to respond easily to requests for gigs 'in support of...’ and Show of Hands have raised money for local causes, such as keeping a rural post-office open, as well as global issues, including those relating to education and health.\n\nNo Secrets\n\nA deluxe, in depth photographic book No Secrets (Flood Gallery 2017) details Show of Hands' extraordinary career and their prolific output. Told in part in their own words, No Secrets features photographs, artwork and stories made public for the first time.\n\nNo Secrets is also the title of the single released on 21 April 2017 (Hands On Music). It follows the book’s publication to mark Show of Hands fifth triumph at the Royal Albert Hall the week before.\n\nAutumn 2017 saw the band starting work on their latest studio album 'Joint Venture' and continuing to explore new sonic landscapes in their ongoing musical collaborations.\n\nPatrons\n\nShow of Hands are patrons of the Sidmouth Folk Festival and St. Ives Festival and are also honorary patrons of the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter and Torrington’s Plough Arts Centre. Knightley is also patron of the Costa Del Folk festival and, along with Oysterband’s John Jones, Shrewsbury Folk Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1958 the first Greek Orthodox Church in Birmingham was inaugurated. Regular liturgies began in Birmingham conducted by the first permanent priest, Father Nicodemos Anagnostou.\n\nThe building was formerly a Catholic Apostolic church. It was designed in 1873 by J.A. Chatwin, who worked on many of Birmingham's churches, including St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham. It is a brick Gothic revival church in the Early English style. It has a wide rectangular nave, an apse at each end and passage aisles through the buttresses. The interior consists of heavy brick arches on stout columns and clerestory windows between clustered wall shafts supporting a high arched roof. The west end has a tall archway set in a diapered brick wall leading into a baptistery. Some of the decoration was by Gibbs and Canning Limited of Tamworth. Renovations have taken place since \"circa\" 2000. The priest is Protopresbyter Kosmas Pavlidis.\n\nThe cathedral also has a Greek school for children and adults who wish to learn the Greek language and culture. There is more information below in the section Apostolos Andreas Greek School.\n\nBy the beginning of the twentieth century, there were Greek Orthodox communities and churches in Manchester, Liverpool and Cardiff, as well as in London. In Birmingham, the foundations for a Greek Orthodox church started immediately after the end of the Second World War. From the beginning of the century, large numbers of Greek Cypriots began to emigrate to Britain in search of a better quality of life. They came mainly to the large cities where it was easier to find work.\n\nBy 1947, there were enough Greek Orthodox people in Birmingham, and the then Archbishop of Thyateira began sending a priest once a month to conduct the liturgy in a church hall next to a Protestant church in Pershore Road. On the remaining Sundays of the month, the Greek Orthodox residents of the Birmingham area would go to churches in London and Manchester to follow the liturgy.\n\nThe congregations grew steadily over the next few years, and in 1951 more regular weekly Sunday liturgies began at the Anglican Church of Saint James in Edgbaston. The Orthodox liturgy would begin after the end of the Protestant service, It was during this period that the first Greek school was opened. Lessons would be conducted in a room over the cafe of Mr Andreas Constantinou.\n\nThe Archbishop of Thyateira, Virvos, advised the small community to start organising itself so that more funds could be raised. Mr Andreas Constantinou was one of the first Cypriot inhabitants of Birmingham, and his cafe was a popular meeting place with many of the Greeks of the city. A friend of his father in law had recently arrived from Cyprus. His name was John Efstathiades.\n\nMr Efstathiades had been a warden of his village church in Cyprus for many years, and he was in a position to help. Even though he was in his 70s, Mr Efstathiades together with Andreas Constantinou, George Sergiou, Christos Christophorides, George Apeches, Michael Angelides, Michael Epifaniou and others began working hard to secure a permanent building for a Greek Orthodox church in Birmingham. They approached all the Greek inhabitants of the area for help so that the most essential church artefacts, such as icons, an Iconostasis and a Holy Bible, could be bought.\n\nThey also went to the Protestant Bishop of Birmingham, the Very Rev. Brian Green for help. The Bishop informed them of four empty churches in and around the city, and the most suitable was the church at Arthur Place near the centre of the city.\n\nSo in 1958 the first Greek Orthodox Church in Birmingham was inaugurated. The church was devoted to the Dormition of the Virgin Mary and Saint Andrew. Regular liturgies began in Birmingham conducted by the first permanent priest, Father Nicodemos Anagnostou.\n\nOn 14 December 1980 Irineos of Patara Birmingham, assistant of the Archdiocese of Great Britain and Thyateira, who had served as Archimandrite in the Church, was ordained as bishop. The ordination was presided over by Archbishop Methodios of Thyateira and Great Britain (Ecumenical Patriarchate) in concelebration with Metropolitan Anthony Bloom and Bishops Gregorios of Tropaion, Chrysostomos of Kyanea and Christophoros of Telmissos.\n\nAs the seat of the new Bishop, the church was subsequently consecrated as The Cathedral of The Dormition of The Theotokos and St. Andreas.\n\nBishop Irinaios died on 19 December 2009. He is buried at Oropos Monastery near Athens, where he spent his final years following his retirement.\n\nThe Apostolos Andreas Greek School in Birmingham was founded in 1958. It was initially housed in a traditional Greek coffee shop (kafeneio) owned by Andreas and Margarita Konstantinou in Lozells. Later on, the school moved to the premises of the church of The Dormition of the Theotokos & Apostolos Andreas. In the early 60s, the number of students increased significantly due to the influx of Cypriot immigrant families. The rooms of a British school in the area were rented out so that over 260 students could be accommodated.\n\nFor about the next 40 years, the school was housed in various British schools in the City of Birmingham and in rooms behind the church, used temporarily. On 23 November 2002 the inauguration of the new building took place in the presence of Archbishop Grigorios. Since then, the school has been housed next to the church, in its own separate premises.\n\nA great number of important people and teachers have joined the school over the years. One of the most pre-eminent was Bishop Irinaios, who served for over 30 years and also became the school's Headmaster.\n\nBut the most important figure in our school and in its history is Mr. Christophoros Cartoudis, who has been teaching at our school since 1961. He is currently the Headmaster, teaching the grandchildren of his students! In recognition for his contribution to the School and the Greek Language, Mr. Cartoudis was awarded the British Empire Medal in the Birthday Honours of 2014 by Her Majesty The Queen.\n\nIn 1995 our school became an examination centre, hosting students from various schools every year.\n\nFor the past 10 years, the Cypriot Ministry of Education has been appointing teachers to Greek Schools throughout the UK through the Cyprus Educational Mission (C.E.M). Our school's Deputies appointed by the CEM were Maria Genari, Gianna Andreou, Christina Christodoulou, Mattheos Venetsanos, and currently, Panagiota Magou.\n\nThe school is also a member of the National Resource Centre for Supplementary Education (NRCSE).\n\nAs years go by, the school's educational vision and values remain the same; teaching the students about the Greek language, history, religion, and culture to help them take pride in themselves and their roots.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2062412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062412", "title": "Asakura Yoshikage", "text": "Asakura Yoshikage\n\nYoshikage was born at the Asakura clan castle in Echizen Province, Ichijōdani Castle, in the present-day Kidanouchi district of Fukui, Fukui Prefecture. His father was Asakura Takakage (1493–1548) and his mother is presumed to be the daughter of Takeda Motomitsu. The Asakura had displaced the Shiba clan as the shugo military commanders of part of Echizen in 1471. Yoshikage succeeded his father as head of the Asakura clan and castle lord of Ichijōdani Castle in 1548. He proved to be adept at political and diplomatic management, markedly demonstrated by the Asakura negotiations with the Ikkō-ikki in Echizen. As a result of the negotiations and effective governance by Yoshikage, Echizen enjoyed a period of relative domestic stability compared to the rest of Sengoku period Japan. Consequently, Echizen became a site for refugees fleeing the violence in the Kansai region. Ichijōdani became a center of culture modeled on the capital at Kyōto.\n\nAfter the capture of Kyoto, Ashikaga Yoshiaki appointed Yoshikage regent and requested Asakura aid in driving Nobunaga out of the capital. As a result, Oda Nobunaga launched an invasion of Echizen. Due to Yoshikage’s lack of military skill, Oda's forces were successful at the Siege of Kanegasaki (in modern-day Tsuruga city), leaving the entire Asakura Domain open to invasion.\n\nYoshikage benefited from the military conflicts between Azai Nagamasa (1545–1573), brother-in-law of Oda Nobunaga. Azai had launched a pincer attack strategy against Nobunaga in Kanegasaki, but the coalition of Asakura and Azai forces failed in the task of capturing Nobunaga. In the Battle of Anegawa in 1570, Yoshikaga and Nagamasa were defeated by the numerically superior Tokugawa clan headed by Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616).\n\nYoshikage fled to Hiezan (Enryaku-ji, Hiei Monastery) after the Battle of Anegawa and negotiated a reconciliation with Nobunaga and was able to avoid conflict for three years. Yoshikage was eventually betrayed by his cousin, Asakura Kageaki (1529–1574) in 1573. He was forced to commit suicide by seppuku at Rokubō Kenshō-ji, a temple which was located in present-day Ōno, Fukui Prefecture. He was 39 years old. The Asakura clan was destroyed with the death of Yoshikage.\n\nThe former Asakura residence in Fukui Prefecture was excavated in 1967 and revealed the ruins of the castle, residences, and gardens of Ichijōdani. The site has been designated a Special Places of Scenic Beauty, Special Historic Sites, and an Important Cultural Properties of Japan as the Ichijōdani Asakura Family Historic Ruins.

{"id": "2062429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062429", "title": "Chung Dong-young", "text": "Chung Dong-young\n\nChung Dong-young (born 27 July 1953 in Sunchang County, North Jeolla) is a politician and was the United New Democratic Party nominee for President of South Korea in 2007.\n\nFrom April 2004 until December 2005, Chung was the South Korean Minister of Unification. Before holding that post, he served two terms in the National Assembly with the National Congress for New Politics and the Millennium Democratic Party, respectively; has twice been chairman of the Uri Party; and was considered a strong contender to succeed Roh Moo-hyun as president. Like Roh, Chung is also a Roman Catholic.\n\nHe has a bachelor's degree in Korean History from Seoul National University (1979) and master's from the University of Wales, and before entering politics, he was a journalist and anchor at the Politics Section of the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. He served as an anchor at MBC Newsdesk from the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nDuring his tenure as Unification Minister, Chung was a strong supporter of the Sunshine Policy. One of his uncontroversial achievements is the foundation of Kaesong Industrial Complex, which is an exclusive industrial zone set up on the southernmost province of North Korea, Keasong. The establishment of the complex, by allowing South Korean small and middle sized companies hiring cheap labors from North Korea brought synergetic effect on the South Korean economy. The complex is now reputed to have promoted peace on the Korean peninsula and to have served as \"the bastion of peace\" whenever the North and South relationship is strained. Some people criticize that he has not taken a tougher stance on North Korea, and that he had rhetorical clashes with the United States that helped weaken relations between the two countries. He was once accused of attempting to distract reporters from a meeting of activists for human rights in North Korea. However, some of the criticisms are biased by the one-sided political perspective from the people who support the hard-line approach to North Korea. The contention that he had impeded on the relationship between South Korea and the United States can be counter proven by the process he had made the Keasong Complex realized. The Keasong Complex could not have made possible unless the then Bush administer had authorized the approve of foreign materials flowing into North Korea. The realization of the complex in the middle of hawk driven period of \"axis of evil\" can only be correctly explained by the quick and wide approach by the then Unification Ministry and the minister Chung to convince the US government and the Korean counterpart.\n\nIn March 2007, while visiting the North Korean town of Kaesong where South Korean companies are set up, he proposed that an inter-Korean summit be organized there. However, since he had lost the presidential election that year, under the Lee Myung-bak government it never materialized.\n\nOn October 15, 2007, the United New Democratic Party announced that Chung won about 44 percent of the votes in the party primary, beating two other candidates, to become the party's candidate for the presidential elections that year.\n\nChung, however, lost the elections to the opposition's Grand National Party candidate Lee Myung-bak by the widest margin since direct elections began in 1987. The loss was attributed primarily to the people's disappointment of the economic situation and its dealings and continuous political strife under the Roh Mu-hyun government as well as the unsuccessful campaign strategies that overly relied on criticizing the other candidate, Lee Myung-bak. The issue of the presidential election in 2007 was predominantly about determining truth of the implication of the presidential candidate Lee Myung bak in the allegation of the investment advisory firm BBK ltd. which had then been accused of large scale stock price manipulation that hurt thousands of individual investors. The primary issue was to prove that he was the real owner of the company.\n\nLee strongly denied the claim even thought there have been plenty of evidence he was at least closely related to the heads of the company and even there was a video tape showing he claiming himself to be the owner of the company. However, any hearings or legal trials of the case had not realized during the presidential election period and obviously after Lee become the president the case lost its force despite the wide public attention to it. Let alone the case, Lee Myung-bak was previously committed fourteen different cases of violations or crimes. However, the widespread perception of the people that the new president has to be the one who can efficiently control the economy has given him the strong edge over the opponent candidate. Evidently, the legitimacy of the president was an issue from the perspective of Chung and Chung's party. He stated that should the turnout for the presidential elections be under 50% that the legitimacy of the result may be an issue. However, the voter turnout was 62.9%.\n\nEarlier, Chung also criticized opposition leader Park Geun-hye of the Grand National Party that they exploited the event to make an image that she is a victim to emotionally move the voters by immediately campaigning during that party's primaries after her recovery from an attack by a man who slashed her face with a small knife. Later, he attributed the downfall of his party in the poll to the attack.\n\nPredictably, the Uri Party suffered a major defeat in the elections in which the opposition Grand National Party took 13 of the 16 provinces and major cities.\n\n\n"}

Since 1992 he has been one half of folk/roots duo Show of Hands along with Phil Beer. Knightley was named \"Songwriter of the Nineties\" by BBC Radio 6 Music in 2012.\n\nKnightley was born in Southampton in 1954 of English, Irish and Scottish descent. His grandfathers were both soldiers. When he was five his family moved to Exeter. At thirteen the family moved again to nearby Exmouth. Apart from spells away in Coventry, Brighton, London and rural Dorset, he remains a resident of East Devon where he lives with his wife Clare, a local medical doctor, and their three children.\n\nAt fourteen he began playing acoustic guitar at Exmouth Grammar School. It was there he met long-time friend and musical collaborator Paul Downes. Knightley was attracted to folk music after hearing his older step-brothers Joan Baez records. Together with Downes they began playing songs from the \"Penguin Book of English Folk Songs\". They were also drawn to the repertoire of Martin Carthy and Dave Swarbrick after seeing them in concert at the Sidmouth Folk Festival. In 1970 they formed the trio 'Gawain' and, along with fiddler John 'Bat' Evans, were regulars on the thriving Devon folk scene for three years or so, meeting Phil Beer in the process. Downes then left for Brighton where he formed a professional partnership with Beer, touring for the next seven years.\n\nBy now, Knightley had moved to Coventry, where he both studied Politics and History at the Lanchester Polytechnic and started and played at a thriving folk club. Downes and Beer were constant visitors to the City and began playing the songs that by now Knightley was beginning to pen.\nHe then completed a postgraduate certificate in education at Sussex University near Brighton. While attending the university, Knightley teamed up with double bass player Warwick Downes, and for two years the duo performed around the Brighton area.\n\nFrom 1979-85, Knightley lived in London, working as a supply teacher and performing regularly on the pub rock circuit with his three bands Short Stories, The Cheats and Total Strangers. On occasions Beer would stand in for absent band members, and Knightley returned the favour by playing bass (under the pseudonym \"Gene Vogel\") for the Arizona Smoke Revue, the group Beer was in at the time.\n\nKnightley left London in 1985 and moved to rural Dorset, where he opened a guest house. He also worked as a supply teacher at Beaminster secondary school, and gave guitar lessons, most notably to PJ Harvey. The following year, Knightley met up again with Beer, who was then a member of the Albion Band. When Beer's commitments would allow, the two performed as a duo and began laying the groundwork for what would become the Show of Hands' first recordings.\n\nBeer left the Albion Band in 1991, and from then on the two appeared regularly as Show of Hands in pubs, clubs and bars. In 1992, the duo got together with a group of exiled Chilean musicians, and toured and released an album under the name Alianza. Knightley continued working at Beaminster as a part-time teacher of media studies, history and music until 1994, when he left to concentrate on his music career.\n\nKnightley is Patron of Shrewsbury Folk Festival, Sidmouth Folk Week, St Ives Festival, and the Village Pump folk festival. In 2012, he was named \"Songwriter of the Nineties\" by Tom Robinson for BBC Radio 6 Music.\n\n\n\n"}

The ranch was started a few years after the Texas Revolution in what is now southeast Houston and Pasadena. The ranch itself extended from Clear Lake to Harrisburg (in modern east Houston). The cattle range covered much of southeast Harris County and Galveston County covering many of the modern communities around Galveston Bay.\n\nThe financial success of the Allen Ranch and its associated businesses substantially influenced the early development of Houston, Harrisburg and Pasadena, and contributed significantly to Galveston's economy in the 19th century.\n\nAs a young man Samuel W. Allen (no relation to the Allen Brothers who founded Houston) came to the newly established Republic of Texas in 1842 in search of opportunity. He arrived at the young town of Harrisburg (modern east Houston) and soon after married into the Thomas family which had come to Texas as part of Stephen F. Austin's original colony. Using land from the Thomas grant which was located along the Buffalo Bayou between Harrisburg and Galveston Bay (what is now Pasadena) Sam Allen launched a cattle ranch in 1844. His cattle range extended much farther down the shoreline of the bay.\n\nLike many ranchers in Texas, Allen began his herd by gathering Longhorn cattle, descended from Spanish cattle brought to the New World, which ran wild throughout Texas. Allen's herd grew rapidly such that by the 1860s had gained exclusive shipping rights for cattle to New Orleans and Cuba from the Morgan Lines, Texas' first steamship company, which was later to become a major factor in establishing Houston as an important Texas port and railroad shipping center.\n\nAllen's fortunes grew rapidly after the American Civil War. Through partnerships and acquisitions Allen's main ranch expanded and he gained ranch lands in other areas of the state. He established processing plants for cattle hides and tallow along the Buffalo Bayou near his range as well as Galveston. The Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad was built through the Allen Ranch in the 1850s and later the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway and the La Porte, Houston and Northern Railroad. The ranch's docks along the Buffalo Bayou became major shipping points and helped contribute to the growth of what would become the Houston Ship Channel. The ranch even had its own private railway station known as \"El Buey.\"\n\nSam W. Allen's son, Samuel E. Allen, took over management of the ranch and, though some of Sam W. Allen's other business ventures failed, the Allen Ranch continued to prosper and grow. It was the largest ranch in the region and one of the largest in the state. By 1900 the Allen Ranch comprised over largely in Harris County with pastures in Galveston County and other surrounding counties. The main portions of the ranch covered much of modern Pasadena, southeast Houston, Clear Lake City, La Porte, and other areas.\n\nThe Allens invested heavily in area business development, in Galveston and Harrisburg, and then later Houston (notably they founded the Oriental Textile Mills, once the world's largest press cloth manufacturer in the cotton industry). They were also wealthy socialites known throughout the region.\n\nFollowing Sam E. Allen's death in 1913, much of the family's ranch holdings were sold off to new development around Pasadena and the growing city of Houston. Sam E. Allen's son, Sam M. Allen, continued to operate the remaining portion on the main ranch in Harris County as well as the ranch lands in Brazoria County. Following Sam M. Allen's death in 1947, the remainder of the ranch was liquidated.\n\nToday many areas of Houston, Pasadena, and other cities bear names referring to the Allen family and the ranch properties.\n\n\n\n"}

Barracks emperors were especially common in the period from 235 through 284, during the Crisis of the Third Century that began with the assassination of Severus Alexander. Beginning with Maximinus Thrax, there were approximately fourteen barracks emperors in 33 years, producing an average reign of a little over two years apiece. The resulting instability in the imperial office and the near constant state of civil war and insurrection threatened to destroy the Roman Empire from within and left it vulnerable to attack from external adversaries.\n\nUnlike previous emperors who had seized power in military \"coups d'état\" (Vespasian and Septimius Severus, both from traditional middle-class Equestrian stock, or Julius Caesar), the barracks emperors tended to be low-class commoners (often from outlying parts of the empire); the first barracks emperor, Maximinus Thrax, had begun his military career as an enlisted soldier. A barracks emperor could not boast of a distinguished family name or a successful career as a statesman or public servant; rather, he had only his military career to recommend himself, and his only influence had been though the soldiers loyal to his command.\n\nSome of these soldier emperors were members of the equestrian class who had worked their way up to a sufficient position of influence within their legion that the soldiers would support a bid for power, although this was a risky undertaking because the soldiers could withdraw their support at any time and perhaps shift it to another military leader who looked more promising at the time.\n\nBecause the barracks emperors were frequently border commanders, the act of overthrowing the reigning emperor and seizing power for themselves left large gaps in the empire's border defenses, gaps that could be exploited by Rome’s enemies, leading to the Germanic incursion into Roman territory in the 260s and resulting in the construction of the Aurelian Walls around Rome. The barracks emperors also used state money to pay their troops – no emperor who had come into power by force of arms could afford to allow his soldiers to become disaffected – and public works and infrastructure fell into ruin. To accommodate the vast demands of buying off their soldiers, the state often simply seized private property, damaging the economy and driving up inflation.\n\nIn 284, yet another barracks emperor named Diocletian who was a cavalry commander, seized power. Diocletian instituted a number of reforms designed to stabilize the empire and the imperial office, bringing an end to the Third Century Crisis and inaugurating the Dominate era of Roman history.\n\nAlthough further Emperors would don the purple on the basis of military power (e.g., Constantine I, Valentinian I, and Theodosius I), the phenomenon of the barracks emperors died out, to be replaced in the late imperial era by shadow emperors like Stilicho, Constantius III, Flavius Aëtius, Avitus, Ricimer, Gundobad, Flavius Orestes, and Odoacer, military strongmen who effectually ruled the empire as imperial generalissimos controlling weak-willed puppet emperors rather than taking the title themselves.\n\nWhen the notion of a barracks emperor is extended to any emperor that was appointed by the army, more emperors whose reign predates the 3rd century can be included:\n\n"}

In this episode, some members of the crew are having trouble sleeping and experience unnerving reactions to particular objects for unknown reasons and decide to investigate it.\n\nSeveral of the \"Enterprise\" crew members are having difficulty sleeping or have lost track of time, and find themselves having strange emotional responses to normal objects. The affected crew realize they have had common experiences, and with Counselor Deanna Troi's help, use the holodeck to collectively reconstruct and refine their fragmented memories and impressions of the events. Their collaboration results in a device like an operating table in a dark room filled with mysterious noises. They come to the conclusion that they have all been to a similar place.\n\nDr. Beverly Crusher examines them, finding evidence of sedation as well as subtle changes to their bodies, such as a microscopic misalignment of the bones in Commander William T. Riker's arm, indicating it has been severed and then reattached. They realize they are being abducted from the ship to be experimented on. When they wonder if this is happening to other crew members as well, they ask the ship's computer to list any missing members and find that two other crew members are currently missing. One soon reappears in his cabin, but dies shortly after he is found, his blood having been transformed into a liquid polymer.\n\nChief Engineer Geordi La Forge and Lt. Commander Data also discover particle emissions in one of the cargo bays, creating an expanding subspace rift which threatens to breach the hull. They devise a method to counter the emissions and close the rift, but they need a way to trace the emissions to the source. Commander Riker volunteers, as he has been taken several nights in a row. Dr. Crusher injects him with a stimulant intended to counteract the sedative his captors are using, and he carries a tracking device which can be detected from the \"Enterprise\" when he is taken. Riker is again taken that night and finds himself in a strange environment on an operating table, near the other missing crew member, surrounded by busy aliens.\n\nThe rift continues to expand and Captain Jean-Luc Picard orders Geordi to begin the attempt to close it. Riker pretends to be unconscious until the aliens are distracted by the rift which had begun to fluctuate. He frees himself, picks up the other crew member and jumps through the rift which had become large enough for them to pass through. They appear in the cargo bay moments before the rift is forced shut. The aliens manage to send a brief energy pulse through at the last second, which disappears through the \"Enterprise\" hull and into space. Picard wonders if the pulse is a probe sent by the aliens attempting to communicate with the \"Enterprise\", but Riker noting their methods which resulted in the death of one of the crew, suspects their motives are less benign.\n\nUnrealitymag.com rated \"Schisms\" as one of the top 10 re-watchable episodes of television in general, praising it as \"creepy\" but also noting some fun scenes.

There are three noncontinuous railway networks in Sumatra (Aceh and North Sumatra; West Sumatra; South Sumatra and Lampung) with two new networks are being developed in Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Indonesia has finalized its plan for a national railway network recently. According to the plan, 3,200 km of train tracks that will criss-cross the islands of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi, it has been touted as the most extensive railway project in Indonesia since its independence from the Dutch in 1945.\n\nUrban railway exist in form of commuter rail in Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya. New mass rapid transit and light rail transit system are currently being introduced in Jakarta and Palembang.\n\nDespite Indonesia has a left-hand running for roads, most of the railway lines use right-hand running due to Dutch influence.\n\nIndonesia's rail gauge is , although and lines previously existed. Newer constructions in Aceh, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi, along with the Jakarta LRT, are using the gauge. Most of the Jakarta metropolitan area is electrified at 1500 V DC overhead.\n\nIndonesia's railways are operated by the state-owned Kereta Api Indonesia, its commuter subsidiary, the Kereta Commuter Indonesia, and the airport rail link subsidiary, the Railink (airport rail link). The infrastructure is state-owned, and companies pay a fee for using the railways.\n\nVarious narrow gauge industrial tramways operate in Java and Sumatra, serving the sugarcane and oil palm industries.\n\nThe first railway line in Indonesia opened in 1867. The railways were gradually expanded by both the state and private companies.\n\nThe Japanese occupation and the Indonesian War of Independence left Indonesia's railways in a poor condition. A batch of 100 steam locomotives were ordered in 1950, and dieselisation started in 1953. By the 1980s most mainline services had been dieselised. Electric multiple units were obtained from Japan beginning in the 1970s, replacing 60-year-old electric locomotives.\n\nSince the independence era, all mainline railways in Indonesia have been managed by the state. The owners of the private railway were compensated first, but the system was fully nationalised in 1971.\n\nConstruction of new railway lines has been scarce, and most new construction is concentrated on double- and quad-tracking of existing railway lines. Most of the former tramway lines have been closed, reducing the mileage from about 7000 km to only 3000 km.\n\nIndonesia had various types of locomotives, being the legacy of the many different companies. Surprisingly, only three steam locomotives remain in operable condition, all located in the Ambarawa Railway Museum. On the other hand, static steam locomotive displays are located in the Transportation Museum (under the auspices of the Department of Transportation) in Jakarta's \"Taman Mini Indonesia Indah\" (Beautiful Indonesia in Miniature Park) and Ambarawa Railway Museum (managed by PT Kereta Api) in Central Java. Plinthed locomotives can also be found in most cities and towns. Somewhat surprisingly, few non-locomotive rolling stock were preserved.\n\nWith the Asian economic crisis of 1997, remaining hulks of steam locomotives formerly standing in former depots became valuable for their scrap value, and by 2000, most locomotives not already plinthed or sent to museums were scrapped, presumably illegally.\n\nFour operable industrial steam locomotives are present, with two more preserved, at the Cepu Forest Railway. This currently represents the largest concentration of active preserved steam locomotives in Indonesia.\n\nSeveral \"last\" steam locomotives were built for Indonesia. E1060, a 1966-built rack steam locomotive (Esslingen 5316) is operable in Ambarawa railway museum. BB84, the last Mallet locomotive built for a non-tourist railway (according to Durrant) was built by Nippon Sharyo Keizo Kaisha in 1962 (works number 2007). This locomotive was plinthed in Banda Aceh and survived the December 2004 tsunami. The locomotive is in rather poor condition with its valve gear and cylinder pistons missing (as of March 2006).\n\nSteam locomotive 1622 \"Sri Gunung\" (Mountain Queen), a mallet built in 1928, preserved in the Dutch Railway Museum.\n\nThe Trangkil No. 4 (Hunslet 3902) was built in 1971, being the last steam locomotive built at Hunslet's Jack Lane Works in Leeds, England. The locomotive was used on the Trangkil sugar mill estate on Java. It has been repatriated to the UK in 2004.\n\nAs of 2016, PT Kereta Api operates about 350 units of diesel locomotives divided into classes in Java and Sumatra used both for passenger and freight services. The first diesel locomotive owned by PT Kereta Api was CC200 class, built by General Electric in 1953.\n\nAs of August 2017, PT Kereta Api's commuter subsidiary, Kereta Commuter Indonesia, operates 758 units of electric multiple units (EMU) in Greater Jakarta area. Most EMUs operated in Jakarta are secondhand trains acquired from major urban railway operators in Greater Tokyo in Japan, such as East Japan Railway Company and Tokyo Metro.\n\nThe first railways in Indonesia were built on the island of Java, using gauge. During the Japanese occupation, they were converted to gauge. At its greatest extent, the Javanese network had a length of , connecting most parts of the island. The Javanese network train (in Java Island) is divided into nine operating divisions.\n\nIn Sumatra as of 2013, there are 1,869 kilometres of track, of which 1,348 km are operational. Several unconnected railway networks were built in the time of the Dutch East Indies:\n\nPlans to connect up and fix these isolated lines are included in the Trans-Sumatra Railway plan. Railway services in Sumatra by operational is divided into three regional divisions, which are:\n\nIn 2010, plans were announced for Kalimantan to get a 122 km long railway for the transport of coal between the mine and the port of Bengalon. In January 2016, Russian Railways reported that its construction of a railway in Kalimantan will finish in 2019. \n\nIn 2019 it was reported in \"Gapura Bali\" that Wayan Koster, governor of Bali, \"is keen to improve Bali's transportation infrastructure and is considering plans to build an electric rail network across the island\".\n\nThe Trans-Sulawesi Railway is under construction, and will be built with standard gauge which is wider than the cape gauge used in Java and Sumatra to accommodate more weight and speed.\n\nA 440km railway from Manokwari to Sorong in Papua is planned.\n\nPT Kereta Api Indonesia(Persero) provides extensive passenger services. Various classes are available, from \"'Argo'\" class with reclining seats and plane - like facilities, executive class with air conditioner and reclining seat comparable to the better classes of other countries' railways, business coaches which recently have been equipped with air conditioner and reclining seats much like executive class, to the hard bench, but still air conditioned economy class coaches for cheaper trains. In last couple of years, the business and economic class are in the process of being equipped with air conditioned system. The whole process was completed in early 2013.\n\nSleeper trains have existed in Indonesia. The last all-sleeper train service was Bima express train which ran from 1967 to 1984 when it was changed to mostly coach, leaving only one or two sleeping cars. It ran in this configuration until 1995, when the sleeper cars were withdrawn and modified into seating coach. Since 2018, sleeper trains have been re-activated for the Argo Bromo Anggrek (Jakarta to Surabaya), Taksaka (Jakarta to Yogyakarta), Argo Lawu and Argo Dwipangga (Jakarta to Solo), and Gajayana (Jakarta to Malang).\nIn Java, most trains connect Jakarta and the hinterland - regional (or \"cross-country\" services) have not been fully developed. Between pairs of important cities such as Jakarta and Bandung, intensive hourly services are provided.\n\nMost passenger trains in Indonesia, except commuter locals, are named. The names varies from plainly descriptive such as Depok Ekspress (a fast service between Jakarta and Depok), through Logawa (name of a river near Purwokerto, which is served by the train), Argo Lawu (Mt. Lawu, an extinct volcano near Solo, which is served by the said express train), to more or less meaningless, though romantic, names such as Bangunkarta (abbreviation of names of cities it serves: Jombang-Madiun-Jakarta) and Matarmaja (Malang-Blitar-Madiun-Jakarta).\nRailway passenger services experienced a \"renaissance\" in the 1995-1999 period, with the introduction of many new passenger express services. With the advent of cheap airplane tickets, PT Kereta Api has experienced a downturn in the number of passengers carried, though the number has stabilized and most trains remain at more than 50% occupancy rate.\n\nNote: K.A. Argo Gede no longer exists (and also K.A. Parahyangan). As a replacement, K.A. Argo Parahyangan trains operate the same routing as a merge of K.A. Argo Gede and K.A. Parahyangan.\n\nAs a response to many reports of sexual harassment in public places, including commuter trains and buses, PT Kereta Api launched women-only carriages in some commuter trains in Jakarta metropolitan area in August 2010.\nOn May 13, 2013 PT KAI changed women-only trains to regular trains which at the front and back of the train has a coach for women only. This rule apply in KRL Jabodetabek. \n\nPT KAI designates priority seats to elderly passengers, pregnant women, disabled passengers and mother with infant to ride public transport with an equal degree of access and comfort as other people. This apply in KRL Jabodetabek. Priority seat not only in the first and end of the train like in women only carriages, but eight seats in each carriage are designated as priority seats. \nPT KAI relaunched the Sleeper Train service in June 11, 2018. This sleeper train is equipped with excellent facilities even in the same class as a first class aircraft cabin. The first route for Sleeper Train is from Gambir Jakarta to Surabaya. The operational of the Luxury Sleeper Train will be taken over by PT KA Tourism.\n\nThe railway system in Java is more or less a passenger-oriented system, and there are few freight services, due to the limited capacity of the tracks. Some notable freight service in Java include the \"Kalimas\" container train and the Parcel train between Jakarta and Surabaya, petroleum trains between refineries or oil pipe terminals and oil depots, and quartz sand trains in Central Java.\n\nBut in recent years, there has been many efforts to increase freight traffic in Java by introducing the GE CC206 locomotives, as well as building double track lines that connect Jakarta and Surabaya on North Coast line to increase the number of container trains between both cities. Many container ports have also been built on intermediate cities and towns. This effort already attract some customers who normally shipped their products via roads.\n\nThe system in South Sumatra is rather freight-oriented. Coal unit trains, carrying coal for an electricity plant are given priority over passenger trains. In West Sumatra, the remaining railway line serves the cement plant at Indarung, near Padang, and in North Sumatra, several oil palm and rubber plantations are served by freight trains.\n\nKRL Commuterline Jabodetabek is one of operational urban rail network in Indonesia, serving commuter routes in Greater Jakarta which comprises cities of DKI Jakarta, Depok, Bogor, Bekasi, Tangerang, and South Tangerang as well as regencies of Bogor, Bekasi, and Lebak. The other operational urban rail network are Jakarta MRT, Jakarta LRT, and an airport rail link to support the public transport network in the area.\n\nRegional rail functions as commuter rail in Surabaya, so technically there is no urban rail network. However, there are plans for a mass rapid transit network in and around Surabaya. A 32 km diesel line from Mojokerto to Sidoarjo has been put into service, with 6 daily return trips.\n\nPalembang Light Rail Transit had operate in June 2018, before the 2018 Asian Games.\n\nMedan has Kualanamu Airport Rail Link transport which linking Kualanamu International Airport to Medan station and vice versa.\n\nIn recent decades, Javan transportation backbones — north coast road and railway system that serves Jakarta-Surabaya corridor, has suffered greatly from both freight and passenger congestion. The plan to build a high-speed railway system in Java has been around for many years. However, it was not until 2008 that the idea had been contemplated seriously. It was Japan International Cooperation Agency's proposal that initiated the idea to build high-speed rail for the Indonesian island of Java, linking up the densely populated corridor from the capital Jakarta to Surabaya city (covering 730 km) in East Java. Japan is eager to export their Shinkansen high-speed rail technology abroad. Following up JICA's initial study in 2012, the detailed feasibility study was concluded in 2014. In recent years, Indonesia has been undergoing a revival in railway expansion and upgrades. The high-speed rail corridors have been proposed but not implemented yet, since it was deemed too costly.\n\nIn April 2015, China had entered the race with a counter-offer to build the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail in Indonesia. A bid which alarmed Japan that has been nurtured the idea for years.\n\nIn July 2015, the Indonesian government announced their plan to build the high-speed rail system connecting Jakarta and Bandung, and devised a competition between Japan and China train-makers as potential bidders. Japan and China had expressed their interest in the project; both countries have done comprehensive studies of the project.\n\nIn late September 2015, Indonesia awards this multibillion-dollar railway project to China over Japan.\n\nThe proposed high-speed rail will connect the nation's capital Jakarta with Bandung city in neighboring West Java province, covering a distance of 150 kilometers, and is also expected to expand further, connecting to Indonesia's second largest city, Surabaya in East Java. The project is scheduled to commence in late 2015, and is expected to open its operations to public by 2019.\n\nIn December 2015 discussion for the Jakarta-Surabaya high-speed rail was commenced by the Indonesian Coordinating Minister of Maritime and Resources. Academicians from two major universities in Indonesia, and employees from Japan International Cooperation Agency, were invited to attend the discussion. \n\nTo buy ticket for long distance train by PT KAI (traveling around Java Island), passenger can go to the official site of PT KAI. \n\nTo buy ticket for commuter in Jakarta or Jabodetabek area, there are three types of tickets (for KRL user).\n\n\nTo use the card, passenger taps the card in the automatic fare gate when first entering the station and taps again when leaving the destination station.\n\n\n\n\n"}
