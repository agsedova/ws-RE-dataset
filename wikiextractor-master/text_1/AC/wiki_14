{"id": "2064935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064935", "title": "Euler–Bernoulli beam theory", "text": "Euler–Bernoulli beam theory\n\nEuler–Bernoulli beam theory (also known as engineer's beam theory or classical beam theory) is a simplification of the linear theory of elasticity which provides a means of calculating the load-carrying and deflection characteristics of beams. It covers the case for small deflections of a beam that are subjected to lateral loads only. It is thus a special case of Timoshenko beam theory. It was first enunciated circa 1750, but was not applied on a large scale until the development of the Eiffel Tower and the Ferris wheel in the late 19th century. Following these successful demonstrations, it quickly became a cornerstone of engineering and an enabler of the Second Industrial Revolution.\n\nAdditional mathematical models have been developed such as plate theory, but the simplicity of beam theory makes it an important tool in the sciences, especially structural and mechanical engineering.\n\nPrevailing consensus is that Galileo Galilei made the first attempts at developing a theory of beams, but recent studies argue that Leonardo da Vinci was the first to make the crucial observations. Da Vinci lacked Hooke's law and calculus to complete the theory, whereas Galileo was held back by an incorrect assumption he made.\n\nThe Bernoulli beam is named after Jacob Bernoulli, who made the significant discoveries. Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli were the first to put together a useful theory circa 1750.\nAt the time, science and engineering were generally seen as very distinct fields, and there was considerable doubt that a mathematical product of academia could be trusted for practical safety applications. Bridges and buildings continued to be designed by precedent until the late 19th century, when the Eiffel Tower and Ferris wheel demonstrated the validity of the theory on large scales.\n\nThe Euler–Bernoulli equation describes the relationship between the beam's deflection and the applied load:\n\nThe curve formula_2 describes the deflection of the beam in the formula_3 direction at some position formula_4 (recall that the beam is modeled as a one-dimensional object). formula_5 is a distributed load, in other words a force per unit length (analogous to pressure being a force per area); it may be a function of formula_4, formula_7, or other variables. formula_8 is the elastic modulus and formula_9 is the second moment of area of the beam's cross-section. formula_9 must be calculated with respect to the axis which passes through the centroid of the cross-section and which is perpendicular to the applied loading. Explicitly, for a beam whose axis is oriented along \"x\" with a loading along \"z\", the beam's cross-section is in the \"yz\" plane, and the relevant second moment of area is\nwhere it is assumed that the centroid of the cross-section occurs at \"y\" = \"z\" = 0.\n\nOften, the product formula_12 (known as the flexural rigidity) is a constant, so that\n\nThis equation, describing the deflection of a uniform, static beam, is used widely in engineering practice. Tabulated expressions for the deflection formula_7 for common beam configurations can be found in engineering handbooks. For more complicated situations, the deflection can be determined by solving the Euler–Bernoulli equation using techniques such as \"direct integration\", \"Macaulay's method\", \"moment area method, \"conjugate beam method\", \"the principle of virtual work\", \"Castigliano's method\", \"flexibility method\", \"slope deflection method\", \"moment distribution method\", or \"direct stiffness method\".\n\nSign conventions are defined here since different conventions can be found in the literature. In this article, a right-handed coordinate system is used as shown in the figure, Bending of an Euler–Bernoulli beam. . Since formula_15 where formula_16, formula_17, and formula_18 are unit vectors in the direction of the x, y, and z axes respectively, the y axis direction is into the figure. Forces acting in the positive formula_4 and formula_3 directions are assumed positive. The sign of the bending moment formula_21 is positive when the torque vector associated with the bending moment on the right hand side of the section is in the positive y direction (i.e. so that a positive value of formula_21 leads to a compressive stress at the bottom fibers). With this choice of bending moment sign convention, in order to have formula_23, it is necessary that the shear force formula_24 acting on the right side of the section be positive in the z direction so as to achieve static equilibrium of moments. To have force equilibrium with formula_25, the loading intensity formula_5 must be positive in the negative z direction. In addition to these sign conventions for scalar quantities, we also sometimes use vectors in which the directions of the vectors is made clear through the use of the unit vectors, formula_16, formula_17, and formula_18.\n\nSuccessive derivatives of the deflection formula_7 have important physical meanings: formula_31 is the slope of the beam,\nis the bending moment in the beam, and\nis the shear force in the beam.\n\nThe stresses in a beam can be calculated from the above expressions after the deflection due to a given load has been determined.\n\nBecause of the fundamental importance of the bending moment equation in engineering, we will provide a short derivation. We change to polar coordinates. The length of the neutral axis in the figure is formula_34 The length of a fiber with a radial distance formula_3 below the neutral axis is formula_36 Therefore, the strain of this fiber is\n\nThe stress of this fiber is formula_38 where formula_8 is the elastic modulus in accordance with Hooke's Law. The differential force vector, formula_40 resulting from this stress is given by,\n\nThis is the differential force vector exerted on the right hand side of the section shown in the figure. We know that it is in the formula_16 direction since the figure clearly shows that the fibers in the lower half are in tension. formula_43 is the differential element of area at the location of the fiber. The differential bending moment vector, formula_44 associated with formula_45 is given by\n\nThis expression is valid for the fibers in the lower half of the beam. The expression for the fibers in the upper half of the beam will be similar except that the moment arm vector will be in the positive z direction and the force vector will be in the -x direction since the upper fibers are in compression. But the resulting bending moment vector will still be in the -y direction since formula_47 Therefore, we integrate over the entire cross section of the beam and get for formula_48 the bending moment vector exerted on the right cross section of the beam the expression\n\nwhere formula_9 is the second moment of area. From calculus, we know that when formula_51 is small as it is for an Euler–Bernoulli beam, formula_52 (formula_53 is the radius of curvature). Therefore,\n\nThis vector equation can be separated in the bending unit vector definition (M is oriented as ey), and in the bending equation:\n\nThe dynamic beam equation is the Euler–Lagrange equation for the following action\nThe first term represents the kinetic energy where formula_57 is the mass per unit length; the second one represents the potential energy due to internal forces (when considered with a negative sign) and the third term represents the potential energy due to the external load formula_58. The Euler–Lagrange equation is used to determine the function that minimizes the functional formula_59. For a dynamic Euler–Bernoulli beam, the Euler–Lagrange equation is\n\nWhen the beam is homogeneous, formula_8 and formula_9 are independent of formula_4, and the beam equation is simpler:\n\nIn the absence of a transverse load, formula_5, we have the free vibration equation. This equation can be solved using a Fourier decomposition of the displacement into the sum of harmonic vibrations of the form\nwhere formula_67 is the frequency of vibration. Then, for each value of frequency, we can solve an ordinary differential equation\nThe general solution of the above equation is\nwhere formula_70 are constants. These constants are unique for a given set of boundary conditions. However, the solution for the displacement is not unique and depends on the frequency. These solutions are typically written as\nThe quantities formula_72 are called the natural frequencies of the beam. Each of the displacement solutions is called a mode and the shape of the displacement curve is called the mode shape.\n\nThe boundary conditions for a cantilevered beam of length formula_73 (fixed at formula_74) are\nIf we apply these conditions, non-trivial solutions are found to exist only if\nformula_76\nThis nonlinear equation can be solved numerically. The first few roots are \"β L/π\" = 0.59686..., \"β L/π\" = 1.49418..., \"β L/π\" = 2.50025..., \"β L/π\" = 3.49999..., ...\n\nThe corresponding natural frequencies of vibration are\nThe boundary conditions can also be used to determine the mode shapes from the solution for the displacement:\nThe unknown constant (actually constants as there is one for each formula_79), formula_80, which in general is complex, is determined by the initial conditions at formula_81 on the velocity and displacements of the beam. Typically a value of formula_82 is used when plotting mode shapes. Solutions to the undampened forced problem have unbounded displacements when the driving frequency matches a natural frequency formula_72, i.e., the beam can resonate. The natural frequencies of a beam therefore correspond to the frequencies at which resonance can occur.\n\nA free-free beam is a beam without any supports. The boundary conditions for a free beam of length \"L\" extending from \"x\"=0 to \"x\"=L is given by:\n\nIf we apply these conditions, non-trivial solutions are found to exist only if\nformula_85\n\nThis nonlinear equation can be solved numerically. The first few roots are \"β L/π\" = 1.50562..., \"β L/π\" = 2.49975..., \"β L/π\" = 3.50001..., \"β L/π\" = 4.50000...\n\nThe corresponding natural frequencies of vibration are:\nThe boundary conditions can also be used to determine the mode shapes from the solution for the displacement:\nAs with the cantilevered beam, the unknown constants are determined by the initial conditions at formula_81 on the velocity and displacements of the beam. Also, solutions to the undampened forced problem have unbounded displacements when the driving frequency matches a natural frequency formula_72.\n\nBesides deflection, the beam equation describes forces and moments and can thus be used to describe stresses. For this reason, the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation is widely used in engineering, especially civil and mechanical, to determine the strength (as well as deflection) of beams under bending.\n\nBoth the bending moment and the shear force cause stresses in the beam. The stress due to shear force is maximum along the neutral axis of the beam (when the width of the beam, t, is constant along the cross section of the beam; otherwise an integral involving the first moment and the beam's width needs to be evaluated for the particular cross section), and the maximum tensile stress is at either the top or bottom surfaces. Thus the maximum principal stress in the beam may be neither at the surface nor at the center but in some general area. However, shear force stresses are negligible in comparison to bending moment stresses in all but the stockiest of beams as well as the fact that stress concentrations commonly occur at surfaces, meaning that the maximum stress in a beam is likely to be at the surface.\n\nFor beam cross-sections that are symmetrical about a plane perpendicular to the neutral plane, it can be shown that the tensile stress experienced by the beam may be expressed as:\n\nHere, formula_3 is the distance from the neutral axis to a point of interest; and formula_21 is the bending moment. Note that this equation implies that pure bending (of positive sign) will cause zero stress at the neutral axis, positive (tensile) stress at the \"top\" of the beam, and negative (compressive) stress at the bottom of the beam; and also implies that the maximum stress will be at the top surface and the minimum at the bottom. This bending stress may be superimposed with axially applied stresses, which will cause a shift in the neutral (zero stress) axis.\n\nThe maximum tensile stress at a cross-section is at the location formula_93 and the maximum compressive stress is at the location formula_94 where the height of the cross-section is formula_95. These stresses are\nThe quantities formula_97 are the section moduli and are defined as\nThe section modulus combines all the important geometric information about a beam's section into one quantity. For the case where a beam is doubly symmetric, formula_99 and we have one section modulus formula_100.\n\nWe need an expression for the strain in terms of the deflection of the neutral surface to relate the stresses in an Euler–Bernoulli beam to the deflection. To obtain that expression we use the assumption that normals to the neutral surface remain normal during the deformation and that deflections are small. These assumptions imply that the beam bends into an arc of a circle of radius formula_101 (see Figure 1) and that the neutral surface does not change in length during the deformation.\n\nLet formula_102 be the length of an element of the neutral surface in the undeformed state. For small deflections, the element does not change its length after bending but deforms into an arc of a circle of radius formula_101. If formula_104 is the angle subtended by this arc, then formula_105.\n\nLet us now consider another segment of the element at a distance formula_3 above the neutral surface. The initial length of this element is formula_102. However, after bending, the length of the element becomes formula_108. The strain in that segment of the beam is given by\nwhere formula_110 is the curvature of the beam. This gives us the axial strain in the beam as a function of distance from the neutral surface. However, we still need to find a relation between the radius of curvature and the beam deflection formula_7.\n\nLet P be a point on the neutral surface of the beam at a distance formula_4 from the origin of the formula_113 coordinate system. The slope of the beam is approximately equal to the angle made by the neutral surface with the formula_4-axis for the small angles encountered in beam theory. Therefore, with this approximation,\nTherefore, for an infinitesimal element formula_102, the relation formula_105 can be written as\nHence the strain in the beam may be expressed as\n\nFor a homogeneous isotropic linear elastic material, the stress is related to the strain by formula_120, where formula_8 is the Young's modulus. Hence the stress in an Euler–Bernoulli beam is given by\nNote that the above relation, when compared with the relation between the axial stress and the bending moment, leads to\nSince the shear force is given by formula_124, we also have\n\nThe beam equation contains a fourth-order derivative in formula_4. To find a unique solution formula_127 we need four boundary conditions. The boundary conditions usually model \"supports\", but they can also model point loads, distributed loads and moments. The \"support\" or displacement boundary conditions are used to fix values of displacement (formula_7) and rotations (formula_129) on the boundary. Such boundary conditions are also called Dirichlet boundary conditions. Load and moment boundary conditions involve higher derivatives of formula_7 and represent momentum flux. Flux boundary conditions are also called Neumann boundary conditions.\n\nAs an example consider a cantilever beam that is built-in at one end and free at the other as shown in the adjacent figure. At the built-in end of the beam there cannot be any displacement or rotation of the beam. This means that at the left end both deflection and slope are zero. Since no external bending moment is applied at the free end of the beam, the bending moment at that location is zero. In addition, if there is no external force applied to the beam, the shear force at the free end is also zero.\n\nTaking the formula_4 coordinate of the left end as formula_132 and the right end as formula_73 (the length of the beam), these statements translate to the following set of boundary conditions (assume formula_12 is a constant):\n\nA simple support (pin or roller) is equivalent to a point force on the beam which is adjusted in such a way as to fix the position of the beam at that point. A fixed support or clamp, is equivalent to the combination of a point force and a point torque which is adjusted in such a way as to fix both the position and slope of the beam at that point. Point forces and torques, whether from supports or directly applied, will divide a beam into a set of segments, between which the beam equation will yield a continuous solution, given four boundary conditions, two at each end of the segment. Assuming that the product \"EI\" is a constant, and defining formula_137 where \"F\" is the magnitude of a point force, and formula_138 where \"M\" is the magnitude of a point torque, the boundary conditions appropriate for some common cases is given in the table below. The change in a particular derivative of \"w\" across the boundary as \"x\" increases is denoted by formula_139 followed by that derivative. For example, formula_140 where formula_141 is the value of formula_142 at the lower boundary of the upper segment, while formula_143 is the value of formula_142 at the upper boundary of the lower segment. When the values of the particular derivative are not only continuous across the boundary, but fixed as well, the boundary condition is written e.g., formula_145 which actually constitutes two separate equations (e.g., formula_146 = fixed).\n\nNote that in the first cases, in which the point forces and torques are located between two segments, there are four boundary conditions, two for the lower segment, and two for the upper. When forces and torques are applied to one end of the beam, there are two boundary conditions given which apply at that end. The sign of the point forces and torques at an end will be positive for the lower end, negative for the upper end.\n\nApplied loads may be represented either through boundary conditions or through the function formula_147 which represents an external distributed load. Using distributed loading is often favorable for simplicity. Boundary conditions are, however, often used to model loads depending on context; this practice being especially common in vibration analysis.\n\nBy nature, the distributed load is very often represented in a piecewise manner, since in practice a load isn't typically a continuous function. Point loads can be modeled with help of the Dirac delta function. For example, consider a static uniform cantilever beam of length formula_73 with an upward point load formula_149 applied at the free end. Using boundary conditions, this may be modeled in two ways. In the first approach, the applied point load is approximated by a shear force applied at the free end. In that case the governing equation and boundary conditions are:\n\nAlternatively we can represent the point load as a distribution using the Dirac function. In that case the equation and boundary conditions are\n\nNote that shear force boundary condition (third derivative) is removed, otherwise there would be a contradiction. These are equivalent boundary value problems, and both yield the solution\n\nThe application of several point loads at different locations will lead to formula_2 being a piecewise function. Use of the Dirac function greatly simplifies such situations; otherwise the beam would have to be divided into sections, each with four boundary conditions solved separately. A well organized family of functions called Singularity functions are often used as a shorthand for the Dirac function, its derivative, and its antiderivatives.\n\nDynamic phenomena can also be modeled using the static beam equation by choosing appropriate forms of the load distribution. As an example, the free vibration of a beam can be accounted for by using the load function:\n\nwhere formula_57 is the linear mass density of the beam, not necessarily a constant. With this time-dependent loading, the beam equation will be a partial differential equation:\n\nAnother interesting example describes the deflection of a beam rotating with a constant angular frequency of formula_67:\n\nThis is a centripetal force distribution. Note that in this case, formula_5 is a function of the displacement (the dependent variable), and the beam equation will be an autonomous ordinary differential equation.\n\nThe three point bending test is a classical experiment in mechanics. It represents the case of a beam resting on two roller supports and subjected to a concentrated load applied in the middle of the beam. The shear is constant in absolute value: it is half the central load, P / 2. It changes sign in the middle of the beam. The bending moment varies linearly from one end, where it is 0, and the center where its absolute value is PL / 4, is where the risk of rupture is the most important.\nThe deformation of the beam is described by a polynomial of third degree over a half beam (the other half being symmetrical).\n\nThe bending moments (formula_21), shear forces (formula_161), and deflections (formula_7) for a beam subjected to a central point load and an asymmetric point load are given in the table below.\nAnother important class of problems involves cantilever beams. The bending moments (formula_21), shear forces (formula_161), and deflections (formula_7) for a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at the free end and a uniformly distributed load are given in the table below.\nSolutions for several other commonly encountered configurations are readily available in textbooks on mechanics of materials and engineering handbooks.\n\nThe bending moments and shear forces in Euler–Bernoulli beams can often be determined directly using static balance of forces and moments. However, for certain boundary conditions, the number of reactions can exceed the number of independent equilibrium equations. Such beams are called \"statically indeterminate\".\n\nThe built-in beams shown in the figure below are statically indeterminate. To determine the stresses and deflections of such beams, the most direct method is to solve the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation with appropriate boundary conditions. But direct analytical solutions of the beam equation are possible only for the simplest cases. Therefore, additional techniques such as linear superposition are often used to solve statically indeterminate beam problems.\n\nThe superposition method involves adding the solutions of a number of statically determinate problems which are chosen such that the boundary conditions for the sum of the individual problems add up to those of the original problem.\n\nAnother commonly encountered statically indeterminate beam problem is the cantilevered beam with the free end supported on a roller. The bending moments, shear forces, and deflections of such a beam are listed below:\n\nThe kinematic assumptions upon which the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory is founded allow it to be extended to more advanced analysis. Simple superposition allows for three-dimensional transverse loading. Using alternative constitutive equations can allow for viscoelastic or plastic beam deformation. Euler–Bernoulli beam theory can also be extended to the analysis of curved beams, beam buckling, composite beams, and geometrically nonlinear beam deflection.\n\nEuler–Bernoulli beam theory does not account for the effects of transverse shear strain. As a result, it underpredicts deflections and overpredicts natural frequencies. For thin beams (beam length to thickness ratios of the order 20 or more) these effects are of minor importance. For thick beams, however, these effects can be significant. More advanced beam theories such as the Timoshenko beam theory (developed by the Russian-born scientist Stephen Timoshenko) have been developed to account for these effects.\n\nThe original Euler–Bernoulli theory is valid only for infinitesimal strains and small rotations. The theory can be extended in a straightforward manner to problems involving moderately large rotations provided that the strain remains small by using the von Kármán strains.\n\nThe Euler–Bernoulli hypotheses that plane sections remain plane and normal to the axis of the beam lead to displacements of the form\nUsing the definition of the Lagrangian Green strain from finite strain theory, we can find the \"von Karman strains\" for the beam that are valid for large rotations but small strains. These strains have the form\nFrom the principle of virtual work, the balance of forces and moments in the beams gives us the equilibrium equations\nwhere formula_169 is the axial load, formula_170 is the transverse load, and\nTo close the system of equations we need the constitutive equations that relate stresses to strains (and hence stresses to displacements). For large rotations and small strains these relations are\nwhere\nThe quantity formula_174 is the \"extensional stiffness\",formula_175 is the coupled \"extensional-bending stiffness\", and formula_176 is the \"bending stiffness\".\n\nFor the situation where the beam has a uniform cross-section and no axial load, the governing equation for a large-rotation Euler–Bernoulli beam is\n\n\n"}

In the previous episode, Willow got high on the magic (so much so that her eyes are almost permanently dilated and darkened to black) and crashed a car, breaking Dawn's arm. Willow is still distraught. Dawn is ignoring Buffy and resents her because Buffy was off secretly having sex with Spike during the crisis, so the younger Summers is only talking to Xander. Dawn is further irritated because Buffy is gathering up everything in the household even slightly magical and hiding it so Willow can avoid magical temptation, including a statue of the Hopi god Kokopelli, which Dawn treasures because it belonged to their late mother, Joyce.\n\nThe social worker comes round to check on how Buffy's doing (at the worst possible time) – while the living room is scattered with Willow's old spell ingredients and objects. Buffy digs herself into a deep hole by saying \"It's magic weed.\" Spike, in the daytime but using a blanket to cover him, comes over to her house wanting his lighter back. Then he leaves after worsening the situation, calling Buffy Goldilocks.\n\nIn a state of depression and determined to become a grown-up, Buffy cuts her hair up to her shoulders, and makes a trip to the hairdresser to have it styled. As she leaves, the Trio pulls up to a tanning salon nearby. Warren has modified his freeze ray into an invisibility gun, and they are about to make themselves invisible. However, Andrew and Jonathan fight over who gets to use the gun first and accidentally overload it, sending beams over the parking lot; a beam hits Buffy (now with a new pageboy hairstyle), making her vanish (along with a dumpster, traffic cone, and fire hydrant).\n\nAnya and Xander are talking about their upcoming wedding at the Magic Box. The door opens but no-one enters. Buffy's voice comes out of nowhere, along with picking up two magical circular items and making them look like eyes. Upon discovering this, Xander immediately believes that Willow may have suffered a relapse and confronts her, but Willow is offended and insists that she is not responsible. Buffy continues her invisible adventures in Sunnydale. \"I'm the ghost of fashion victims past,\" she moans to a civilian, who is wearing a studded cap. She then drives off with a parking inspector's cart.\n\nBuffy drives to the workplace of the social worker who had made that morning's inspection to the Summers' home. Using her invisibility to its full advantage, she tricks the social worker into behaving in a bizarre manner and replaces the Summers' report with pages consisting entirely of repetitions of \"All work and no play make Doris a dull girl\", an allusion to \"The Shining\". Doris also tells her supervisor that \"There was a voice. It made my coffee dance\", not knowing that invisible Buffy was teasing and moving the coffee cup to make Doris react and appear insane. The supervisor believes that Doris is having a mental break with reality and sends her home, saying that he would send someone else to inspect the Summers' home the next day.\n\nBuffy then heads to Spike's. She tries to sexually assault Spike while she's invisible, surprising him. \"I told you to stop trying to see me,\" she finally jokes, exposing her identity. Then she and Spike go downstairs to have sex. In the meantime, Xander and Anya discover that the invisibility ray was causing the structure of the traffic cone to break down, and realize that the same thing would happen to Buffy if the invisibility wasn't reversed. Xander runs to Spike's crypt in search of Buffy, where he finds Spike in bed, naked and appearing to be alone. In reality, however, Buffy and Spike are making love. After Spike claims he's \"doing push-ups\", Xander has a chat with him, wanting to know where Buffy is, and Spike honestly says that he hasn't \"seen\" her. Throughout the conversation, invisible Buffy embraces and affectionately teases Spike, making him laugh despite Xander's presence. Spike tries to act normal, somewhat unsuccessfully. Xander finally leaves, puzzled by Spike's odd behavior, telling Spike that he really needs to get a girlfriend.\n\nBuffy wants to continue their physical activities, but Spike tells her that he is tired of being with her and not really having her. He asks her to leave if she isn't really going to be with him. He is frustrated with her carefree attitude and doesn't appreciate the way she seems to be using the invisibility as an excuse to escape her real life. She protests, but eventually leaves. She doesn't do too well at home when she scares Dawn, who has the same frustrations as Spike, combined with extreme worry for her sister. The bad stuff keeps on coming when she gets the message from Xander and Anya on the answering machine. \"Tell her about the pudding\" says Anya, referencing the way the invisible traffic cone found by Willow had started to disintegrate into mush. However, before Buffy can head back to the Magic Box, Jonathan phones her up (disguising his voice so Buffy doesn't identify him) and tells her that the Trio has kidnapped Willow and tells her to meet them at the arcade.\n\nBuffy does so. However, the Trio have also made themselves invisible, and Warren is holding Willow hostage. Warren lies to Buffy, telling her that he is going to reverse the invisibility. But Willow points out that he's put it on a setting that is going to kill her. Warren knocks her to the ground and aims the gun at Buffy, telling her that she can't see them. However, Buffy's Slayer training (and possibly her experiences in \"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\" and \"Family\") provide her with some ability to sense the invisible villains. A scuffle ensues. Warren ends up in the ball-pit, Andrew ends up in the pinball machine and Buffy is holding Jonathan. Willow, who has changed the frequency, aims at Buffy, Jonathan, Andrew, and Warren, and all four are visible again. Buffy finally sees that the Trio are human, rather than demons as she had been expecting. After a brief stand-off, a smoke-bomb goes off and the Trio - despite an embarrassing scuffle to open the arcade door - escape.\n\nBuffy and Willow sit on the curb outside and talk. The two then discuss the events of the day, and Willow admits she nearly used magic but didn't; Buffy also admits that while she's still not happy about being alive, when faced with death she realised she didn't want to die. The two then contemplate their small but notable steps towards dealing with their respective problems.\n"}

{"id": "2064959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064959", "title": "Bartitsu", "text": "Bartitsu\n\nBartitsu is an eclectic martial art and self-defence method originally developed in England during the years 1898–1902, combining elements of boxing, jujitsu, cane fighting, and French kickboxing (savate). In 1903, it was immortalised (as \"baritsu\") by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes mystery stories. Although dormant throughout most of the 20th century, Bartitsu has been experiencing a revival since 2002.\n\nIn 1898, Edward William Barton-Wright, an English engineer who had spent the previous three years living in Japan, returned to England and announced the formation of a \"New Art of Self Defence\". This art, he claimed, combined the best elements of a range of fighting styles into a unified whole, which he had named Bartitsu. Barton-Wright had previously also studied \"boxing, wrestling, fencing, savate and the use of the stiletto under recognised masters\", reportedly testing his skills by \"engaging toughs (street fighters) until (he) was satisfied in their application.\" He defined \"Bartitsu\" as meaning \"self defence in all its forms\"; the word was a portmanteau of his own surname and of \"Jujitsu\".\n\nAs detailed in a series of articles Barton-Wright produced for \"Pearson's Magazine\" between 1899 and 1901, Bartitsu was largely drawn from the Shinden Fudo Ryu jujutsu of Terajima Kuniichiro (not to be confused with the SFR taijutsu associated with the Bujinkan lineage) and from Kodokan judo. As it became established in London, the art expanded to incorporate combat techniques from other jujutsu styles as well as from British boxing, Swiss schwingen, French savate and a defensive la canne (stick fighting) style that had been developed by Pierre Vigny of Switzerland. Bartitsu also included a comprehensive physical culture training system.\n\nIn his notes for a lecture delivered to the Japan Society of London in 1901, Barton-Wright wrote:\n\nBetween 1899 and 1902, Barton-Wright set about publicizing his art through magazine articles, interviews and a series of demonstrations or \"assaults at arms\" at various London venues. He established a school called the Bartitsu Academy of Arms and Physical Culture, known informally as the Bartitsu Club, which was located at 67b Shaftesbury Avenue in Soho. In an article for \"Sandow's Magazine of Physical Culture\" vol. 6, (January 1901), journalist Mary Nugent described the Bartitsu Club as \"... a huge subterranean hall, all glittering, white-tiled walls, and electric light, with 'champions' prowling around it like tigers.\"\n\nVia correspondence with Professor Jigoro Kano, the founder of Kodokan Judo, and other contacts in Japan, Barton-Wright arranged for Japanese jujutsu practitioners Kaneo Tani, Seizo Yamamoto and the nineteen-year-old Yukio Tani to travel to London and serve as instructors at the Bartitsu Club. Kaneo Tani and Yamamoto soon returned to Japan, but Yukio Tani stayed and was shortly joined by another young jujutsuka, Sadakazu Uyenishi. Swiss master-at-arms Pierre Vigny and wrestler Armand Cherpillod were also employed as teachers at the Club. As well as teaching well-to-do Londoners, their duties included performing demonstrations and competing in challenge matches against fighters representing other combat styles. In addition, the Club became the headquarters for a group of fencing antiquarians led by Captain Alfred Hutton and it served as their base for experimenting with historical fencing techniques, which they taught to members of London's acting elite for use in stage combat. It is likely that the actors Esme Beringer and Charles Sefton, as well as fencer Archibald Corble, were among Hutton's historical fencing students at the Bartitsu Club.\n\nIn mid-1901, the curriculum of Bartitsu was further expanded to include breathing exercises under the tuition of Mrs. Kate Behnke.\n\nAs well as the combat gymnasium, the Bartitsu Club incorporated a well-appointed salon equipped with a wide range of electrotherapy machines.\n\nThe Club was organised on the model of the Victorian sporting club; prospective members submitted their applications to a committee, which at one time included both Captain Alfred Hutton and Colonel George Malcolm Fox, former Inspector-General of the British Army's Physical Training Corps. Promoters of the Club included politicians Herbert Gladstone and Lord Alwyne Compton.\n\nBartitsu Club membership included Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon, who was later to achieve notoriety as one of the few adult male survivors of the sinking of the , as well as Captain F.C. Laing of the 12th Bengal Infantry, who subsequently wrote an article on Bartitsu stick fighting techniques which was published in the \"Journal of the United Service Institution of India\". Other Club members included Messrs. Marshall, Collard, Marchant, Roger Noel, Percy Rolt, Lieutenant Glossop and Captains Ernest George Stenson Cooke and Frank Herbert Whittow, both also members of the London Rifle Brigade School of Arms, under the direction of Captain Hutton; and William Henry Grenfell, the 1st Baron Desborough, who was named as the Club president.\n\nBarton-Wright later reported that, during this period, he had challenged and defeated seven larger men within three minutes as part of a Bartitsu demonstration he gave at St. James's Hall. He said this feat earned him a membership in the prestigious Bath Club and also a Royal Command to appear before Edward, Prince of Wales. Unfortunately, Barton-Wright then suffered an injury to his hand, due either to a fight in a Kentish country lane or a bicycling accident, which prevented him from appearing before the Prince.\n\nBarton-Wright encouraged members of the Bartitsu Club to study each of the four major hand-to-hand combat styles taught at the Club, each of which broadly corresponded to a different \"range\" of personal combat.\n\nThe goal was to master each style well enough that they could be used against the others if needed. This process was similar to the modern concept of cross-training and it can be argued that Bartitsu itself was more in the nature of a cross-training system than a formal martial arts style.\n\nBased on Barton-Wright's writings upon this subject, it is evident that Bartitsu placed greatest emphasis upon the Vigny cane fighting system at the striking range and upon jujutsu (and, secondarily, the \"all-in\" style of European wrestling) at the grappling range. Savate and boxing methods were used to segue between these two ranges, or as a means of first response should the defender not be armed with a walking stick. These sports were evidently also practiced so that Bartitsu students could learn how to defend against them through the use of jujutsu and Vigny stick fighting.\n\nThe stick fighting component was based on the two fundamental tactics of either feinting/striking pre-emptively or \"baiting\" the opponent's strike via a position of invitation. Fighting from the style's characteristic high- and double-handed guard positions, stick strikes and thrusts targeted the opponent's face and head, throat, elbows, hands and wrists, solar plexus, knees and shins. The Bartitsu stick fighter would often incorporate close combat techniques such as trips, throws and takedowns, which probably represent a fusion of the Vigny stick system with jujutsu.\n\nBarton-Wright spoke of having modified the techniques of boxing and savate for self-defence purposes, as distinct from academic and fitness training or sporting competition, referring to guards that would cause an attacking boxer to injure his own fists and to defences that would cause an attacking kicker to damage his own leg. Thus, the tactics of the unarmed Bartitsu practitioner were to mount an aggressive defence, employing damaging variations of standard boxing and savate guards, and then to finish the fight with jujutsu, which Barton-Wright evidently viewed as a type of secret weapon during an era in which his Shaftesbury Avenue academy was the only place in England where it could be learned.\n\nAccording to interviewer Mary Nugent, Barton-Wright instituted an unusual pedagogical system whereby students were first required to attend private training sessions before being allowed to join class groups. It is evident that Bartitsu classes included pre-arranged exercises, especially for use in rehearsing those techniques that were too dangerous to be performed at full speed or contact, as well as free-sparring and fencing bouts. According to an anonymous article published in \"The Sketch\" of April 10, 1901, these sessions may have involved a type of circuit training in which students would rotate between small group classes taught by each of the specialist instructors.\n\nMany Bartitsu self-defence techniques and training sequences were recorded by Barton-Wright himself in his series of articles for \"Pearson's Magazine.\" The specific details of other Bartitsu stick fighting training drills were recorded in Captain Laing's article.\n\nBy mid-1902, the Bartitsu Club was no longer active as a martial arts school. The precise reasons for the Club's closure are unknown, but jiujitsu instructor William Garrud subsequently suggested that both the enrollment fees and tuition fees had been too high. It is likely that Barton-Wright had simply overestimated the number of wealthy Londoners who shared his interest in exotic self-defence systems. \n\nThe last recorded activities of the Bartitsu Club as an entity involved a series of touring exhibitions and contests at venues including Cambridge University, the Oxford Town Hall, the Shorncliffe Army Camp base in Kent, the Mechanics Institute Hall in Nottingham and the Adelphi Theatre in Liverpool between January–April of 1902.\n\nSubsequently, most of Barton-Wright's former employees, including jujutsuka Yukio Tani and Sadakazu Uyenishi and Swiss self-defence expert Pierre Vigny, established their own self-defence and combat sports gymnasiums in London. After breaking with Barton-Wright, purportedly due to an argument and a fight, Tani also continued his work as a professional music-hall wrestler under the shrewd management of William Bankier, a strength performer and magazine publisher who went by the stage name of \"Apollo\". Bankier's promotional efforts helped to spur the international fad for jujutsu that Barton-Wright had begun, and which included the publication of numerous books and magazine articles as well as the establishment of jujutsu schools throughout the Western world. This fad lasted until the beginning of World War I and served to introduce Japanese martial arts into Western popular culture, but Bartitsu per se never again returned to prominence during Barton-Wright's lifetime.\n\nBartitsu might have been completely forgotten if not for a cryptic reference by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in one of his Sherlock Holmes mystery stories. In 1903 Conan Doyle had revived Holmes for a further story, \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", in which Holmes explained his victory over Professor Moriarty in their struggle at Reichenbach Falls by the use of \"\"baritsu\", or the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me\".\n\nThe term \"baritsu\" did not exist outside the pages of the English editions of \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" and a 1901 London \"Times\" newspaper report titled \"Japanese Wrestling at the Tivoli\", which covered a Bartitsu demonstration in London but misspelled the name as \"baritsu\". It is likely that Conan Doyle used the 1901 London \"Times\" article as source material, copying the \"baritsu\" misspelling verbatim, particularly in that he had Holmes define \"baritsu\" as \"Japanese wrestling\", which was the same phrase used in the newspaper headline.\n\nGiven the enormous popularity of the Sherlock Holmes stories, the fact that Holmes credited his survival and victory against Moriarty to \"\"baritsu\"\", and the fact that E.W. Barton-Wright's martial art and, with it, its name's proper spelling had quickly faded from popular memory, the confusion of names persisted through much of the 20th century. In an article for \"The Baker Street Journal\" Christmas Annual of 1958, journalist Ralph Judson correctly identified baritsu with Bartitsu, but Judson's article itself eventually became obscured. During the 1980s, researchers Alan Fromm and Nicolas Soames re-affirmed the relationship between \"\"baritsu\"\" and Bartitsu and by the 1990s scholars including Yuichi Hirayama, John Hall, Richard Bowen, and James Webb were able to confidently identify and document the martial art of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nE.W. Barton-Wright spent the remainder of his career working as a physical therapist specialising in innovative (and sometimes controversial) forms of heat, light, and radiation therapy. He continued to use the name \"Bartitsu\" with reference to his various therapeutic businesses. In 1950, Barton-Wright was interviewed by Gunji Koizumi for an article appearing in the Budokwai newsletter, and later that year he was presented to the audience at a Budokwai gathering in London as \"the pioneer of jiujitsu in Great Britain\". He died in 1951, at the age of 90, and was buried in what the late martial arts historian Richard Bowen described as being \"a pauper's grave.\"\n\nIn many ways, E.W. Barton-Wright was a man ahead of his time. He was among the first Europeans known to have studied the Japanese martial arts, and was almost certainly the first to have taught them in Europe, the British Empire or the Americas.\n\nBartitsu was the first martial art to have deliberately combined Asian and European fighting styles towards addressing the problems of civilian/urban self-defence in an \"unarmed society\". In this, Barton-Wright anticipated Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do approach by over seventy years. A similar philosophy of pragmatic eclecticism was taken up by other early 20th-century European self-defence specialists, including Percy Longhurst, William Garrud and Jean Joseph-Renaud, all of whom had studied with former Bartitsu Club instructors.\n\nIn 1906, Renaud introduced a similar concept in France named \"Défense Dans la Rue\" in order to fight the increase of street violence at the time. This art was a mixture of boxing, savate and jiu-jitsu inherited from bartitsu, and was broadened by contemporary authors like Émile André and George Dubois, who had been influenced by master-at-arms Joseph Charlemont. In the 1920s, Brazilian physical culture teacher Mario Aleixo published an article for the \"Eu Sei Tudo\" magazine about his \"Defesa Pessoal\", which mixed capoeira, jiu-jitsu, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling and Portuguese stick-fighting.\n\nBarton-Wright's illustrated article series for \"Pearson's Magazine\" popularised self-defence features in newspapers and magazines, which had previously been rare but which became commonplace during the first decade of the 20th century.\n\nE.W. Barton-Wright is also remembered as a pioneering promoter of mixed martial arts or MMA contests, in which experts in different fighting styles compete under common rules. Barton-Wright's champions, including Yukio Tani, Sadakazu Uyenishi and Swiss \"schwingen\" wrestler Armand Cherpillod enjoyed considerable success in these contests, which anticipated the MMA phenomenon of the 1990s by a hundred years.\n\nThe Bartitsu Club was among the first schools of its type in Europe to offer classes in women's self-defence, a practice taken up after the Club's demise by students of Yukio Tani and Sadakazu Uyenishi including Edith Margaret Garrud and Emily Watts. Mrs. Garrud established her own jujutsu dojo (school) in London and also taught the art to members of the militant Suffragette movement, including the clandestine \"Bodyguard\" unit of the Women's Social and Political Union, establishing an early association between self-defence training and the political philosophy of feminism.\n\nIn July 2015, English author Nigel Gordon reported that he had studied Bartitsu stick fighting, also described as \"Barton-Wright's system of stick fighting\", at a club in the town of Wednesbury, Staffordshire, during the very early 1960s. According to Gordon, there were two similar clubs in the neighbouring towns of Solihull and Tipton, possibly all instructed by a teacher named Frank Small.\n\nA survival or revival of Bartitsu stick fighting during this period would be significant in that the art was otherwise almost entirely forgotten during the mid-20th century.\n\nIn 2001, the \"Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences\" (EJMAS) web site began to re-publish many of Barton-Wright's magazine articles that had been discovered in the British Library archives by Richard Bowen. Almost immediately, the \"Self Defence with a Walking Stick\" articles attracted a minor cult following and the illustrations were reproduced, often with humorous captions or other alterations, on a number of other sites. Also in that year, Bartitsu stick fighting demonstrations were added to the educational displays performed at the Royal Armouries in Leeds, U.K.\n\nIn 2002, an international association of Bartitsu enthusiasts, known as the Bartitsu Society, was formed to research and then revive E.W. Barton-Wright's \"New Art of Self Defence\". The Society approaches Bartitsu research and training via two related fields, those of canonical Bartitsu (the self-defence sequences that were detailed by Barton-Wright and his associates 1899–1902) and neo-Bartitsu (modern, individualised interpretations drawing from the canon but reinforced by the training manuals produced by former Bartitsu Club instructors and their students between 1899 and the early 1920s).\n\nThe modern revival aims to both preserve what is known of the canonical syllabus and to continue Barton-Wright's experiments in cross-training/testing between (kick)boxing, jiujitsu and stick fighting as they were practiced circa 1901, on the premise that these experiments were left as a work in progress when the original Bartitsu Club closed down. Thus, the revival is considered to be a deliberately anachronistic, collaborative, open-ended and open source project.\n\nAssociated interests include the study of the martial arts as Victorian and Edwardian social history. The Bartitsu Society communicates via an email group established by author Will Thomas and individual members offer practical seminars and training courses in Bartitsu fighting techniques.\n\nFrom 2003 onwards, members of the Bartitsu Society began to teach seminar courses in various aspects of the art at stage combat and martial arts conferences throughout the world. Inspired and guided by the Bartitsu Society and the two compendia, Bartitsu training programs have since been launched at the Cumann Bhata Dayton, the Vancouver-based Academie Duello, at the Alte Kampfkunst in Wuppertal, Germany, Briercrest College and Seminary in Caronport, Saskatchewan and at Forteza Fitness and Martial Arts (Ravenswood, Chicago) amongst numerous other locations.\n\nIn August 2005, the Society published a book, \"The Bartitsu Compendium\", which was edited by Tony Wolf. The \"Compendium\" details the complete history of the art as well as a technical curriculum for canonical Bartitsu. The second volume (August 2008) comprises resources for neo-Bartitsu drawn both from Barton-Wright's own writings and from the self-defence manuals produced by his colleagues and their students, including Yukio Tani, William Garrud, H.G. Lang and Jean Joseph Renaud. Proceeds from the sales of the \"Bartitsu Compendium\", the \"Bartitsu Compendium II\", and the \"Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes\" DVD have been dedicated to creating a memorial for E.W. Barton-Wright and to furthering the revival of Bartitsu.\n\nIn September 2006, Bartitsu Society member Kirk Lawson released a DVD entitled \"Bartitsu – the Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes\", which is a presentation of Bartitsu techniques as demonstrated at the Spring '06 Cumann Bhata Western Martial Arts Seminar.\n\nIn October 2006, the Bartitsu Society launched the Bartitsu.org website, which includes information on the history, theory and practice of Barton-Wright's martial art, as well as current events relating to the Bartitsu revival.\n\nIn 2010, a seminar tour was arranged to raise awareness of Bartitsu. Tony Wolf taught consecutive seminars on the West Coast of the USA starting in California and moving to Northwest Fencing Academy and then Academia Duellatoria in Oregon. Seminars were then hosted by the School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts in Seattle, Washington and at Academie Duello in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nIn August 2009, the Bartitsu Society announced the production of a full-length documentary on E.W. Barton-Wright and his self-defence arts, which was released in March 2011. The first international Bartitsu School of Arms seminar/conference event was held in London, U.K. between August 26–28, 2011 and the second event was held in Chicago, U.S.A. between September 7–9, 2012.\n\nIn 2017, Bartitsu came to the attention of a martial arts instructor in Columbus, Georgia. After researching the combat laboratory methods used by the founder and his instructors to add more defense tactics and skills incorporating more ground defense, additional self-defense moves, and basic knife tactics and defenses, he took on his first student. He then founded an academy, christened “Neo-Bartitsu Columbus,” in 2019 and began offering weekly classes through Bishop’s TaeKwonDo Plus.\n\nArticles on various aspects of Bartitsu have been published in numerous journals including \"Classical Fighting Arts\", \"Western Martial Arts Illustrated\", \"The Journal of Asian Martial Arts\", \"SteamPunk Magazine\", \"Rugged Magazine\", \"Breaking Muscle\", the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"The Atlantic\", the \"Chicago Tribune\", \"The Chap\", \"History Today\", \"de Volkskrant\", \"New City\", \"His Vintage Life\", the \"Epoch Times\", \"Ozy Media\" and \"Clarkesworld Magazine\". The art has also been showcased on British television in \"The One Show\", \"Sunday Brunch\" and in \"Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting: the Rise of the Martial Arts in Britain\", an episode of the Timeshift documentary series on BBC Four.\n\nBartitsu: The Lost Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes (2011) is a feature-length documentary detailing the history, decline and modern revival of Bartitsu, with particular reference to its association with Sherlock Holmes.\n\nHost Tony Wolf travels between locations in Europe including the Swiss Reichenbach Falls and the adjacent town of Meiringen, London, Haltwhistle, Rome and Amantea, explaining the origins and heyday of Bartitsu via narration, animated graphics, re-enactments, archival photographs and interviews. Interviewees include authors Will Thomas and Neal Stephenson as well as martial arts historians Mark Donnelly, Emelyne Godfrey, Harry Cook and Graham Noble.\n\nMajor themes include the development of Bartitsu as a confluence of Edwardian interests in Orientalism, physical culture and criminology; the use of jujitsu by the Bodyguards of the radical Suffragette movement in London and subsequent spread of Japanese martial arts through Western popular culture; personality profiles of Barton-Wright himself and the other principal figures of the original Bartitsu craze; and the connection between Bartitsu and Sherlock Holmes' baritsu.\n\nAdditional footage shot in Italy and the United States illustrates the modern revival of Bartitsu as a recreational martial art.\n\nConan Doyle's \"baritsu\" developed a life of its own during the latter 20th century, and it was duly recorded that fictional heroes including Doc Savage and The Shadow had been initiated into its mysteries; the latter two characters were established as knowing baritsu in a DC Comics crossover that spilled over into \"The Shadow Strikes\". Baritsu has been incorporated into numerous Sherlock Holmes-inspired pastiche novels and short stories and also into the rules of several role-playing games set during the Victorian and Edwardian eras.\n\nThe manga and anime series Kuroshitsuji (\"Black Butler\") and Dantarian no Shoka (\"The Mystic Archives of Dantalian\") both feature characters who are proficient in baritsu.\n\nCyrus Barker, the protagonist of novelist Will Thomas' \"Barker and Llewellyn\" mystery series, is partly inspired by E.W. Barton-Wright, as is the villainous Sir Callum Fielding-Shaw in Adrienne Kress' young adult novel \"The Friday Society\".\n\nRichard Ryan, the fight choreographer for the 2009 movie \"Sherlock Holmes\", has described the \"neo-Bartitsu\" developed for that project as being a combination of \"Chinese Boxing (Wing Chun), swordplay and elements of Brazilian Jujitsu.\" This \"movie Bartitsu\" was said to be a modern interpretation of the classic Victorian Bartitsu style. In a 23 December 2009 interview with \"Vanity Fair\" magazine, director Guy Ritchie described baritsu as \"... a form of Jujitsu. This is way before martial arts took off anywhere in Europe. You can actually look it up on the Internet. You’ll see these little men hitting one another with walking sticks. The idea was that you use your opponent’s strengths against them. With the use of surprise. There’s all sorts of locks and chokes and various other techniques used to incapacitate someone. There’s lots of throwing hats at someone’s eyes, and then striking at them, if you can, with a walking stick.\" The movie fight choreography included several signature fighting techniques from Barton-Wright's articles, including double-handed thrusts with walking sticks and the use of an overcoat to distract and entangle an adversary.\n\nThe fight choreography for the 2011 sequel, \"\" bore an even closer resemblance to historical Bartitsu.\n\nIn the DVD commentary for \"A Scandal in Belgravia\" (episode one of the second season of the BBC TV series \"Sherlock\"), writer Mark Gatiss describes a framed glass sign above the title character's bed as showing \"the rules of baritsu, the Japanese martial art which got Holmes out of the situation at the Reichenbach Falls in 'The Final Problem'.\" In fact, the prop sign is a framed Kodokan judo black belt certificate. In the first episode of the third season, Sherlock Holmes alludes to a \"system of Japanese wrestling\" as the second of thirteen scenarios that might have allowed him to survive his rooftop encounter with Moriarty.\n\nThe 2015 graphic novel trilogy \"\" depicts the Bartitsu Club as the headquarters of a secret society of female bodyguards who protect the leaders of the radical suffragettes from arrest and assault. The art is heavily referenced in the graphic novels themselves and in three novellas and short stories inspired by the graphic novels; \"The Second Story Girl\", \"Carried Away\" and \"The Isle of Dogs\".\n\nIn \"Draft of Innocence\", a 2015 episode of the FX Network comedy series \"The League\", Dr. Andre Nowzick (played by Paul Scheer) is announced as a Bartitsu enthusiast and later demonstrates a surprising proficiency in the martial art, defeating four heavily armed thugs in a spectacular back-alley brawl via a combination of stick fighting and jiujitsu.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, Bartitsu was announced as a special achievement award in the Victorian-themed \"Assassin's Creed Syndicate\" video game.\n\nIn February 2016, a \"Bartitsu\" cane fighting variation was announced for the character Bo Rai Cho in the Mortal Kombat video game series.\n\nAiden English and Simon Gotch, known collectively as The Vaudevillains, are professional wrestlers signed to NXT and WWE who incorporate Bartitsu, or \"Victorian Era Martial Arts\" as some announcers have described, into their wrestling style mainly with stances and selective attacks. They espouse a gimmick of wrestlers from the early 20th century such as Karl Gotch.\n\nThe character Roman Torchwick uses a fighting style based on Bartitsu in the popular web series \"RWBY\".\n\nIn the Japanese light novel \"Lord El-Melloi II Case Files\", the character Flat Escardos thinks the Baritsu to be similar to the Hokuto Shinken style from the manga \"Fist of the North Star\".\n\nIn the Japanese Manga and Anime, \"Kengan Ashura\", Mokichi Robinson is known to use Bartitsu.\n\nIn the film \"\", Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth) uses elements of Bartitsu during the pub fight.\n\nIn Mary Robinette Kowal's 2016 fantasy novel \"Ghost Talkers\", set in 1916, a character explains (ch. 11) that he learned Bartitsu after reading about it in Sherlock Holmes.\n\nE. W. Barton-Wright and Bartitsu are featured in the \"Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences\" steampunk novels by Pip Ballantyne and Tee Morris.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily operated as an air force base by the Royal Canadian Air Force and is one of two bases in the country using the CP-140 Aurora and CP-140A Arcturus anti-submarine/maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft. Its primary RCAF lodger unit is 14 Wing, commonly referred to as 14 Wing Greenwood.\n\nThe relatively fog-free climate of the farming hamlet of Greenwood was selected by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Royal Air Force for an airfield as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP), following the signing of that formal agreement on December 17, 1939.\n\nThe airfield for RAF Station Greenwood was constructed between 1940 and 1942 with the first training units arriving as part of No. 36 Operational Training Unit (OTU) on March 9, 1942. Early training aircraft types included the Lockheed Hudson MK III, the Avro Anson, and the Westland Lysander, all from Britain's Royal Air Force. By the end of August 1942 there were 36 aircraft, and 194 trainees out of a total of 1,474 RAF personnel. By November 1942 the number of trainees had doubled and aircraft had expanded to 80.\n\nIn addition to the BCATP program, RAF Station Greenwood was involved in combat operations through maritime reconnaissance to counter U-boat activity in the western Atlantic. These wartime anti-submarine patrols, combined with BCATP training, led to dozens of aircraft crashes throughout the first year of the base being operational, resulting in the deaths of Canadians, as well as 31 airmen from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nOn December 4, 1942, the Canadian Army provided an anti-aircraft searchlight battery, the 5th Special Mobile Anti-Aircraft Search Light Troop, to provide realistic night training to aircrews.\n\nBy the end of 1942, the BCATP was changing across Canada in light of Allied successes in Europe. RAF Station Greenwood was selected to train aircrew on the de Havilland Mosquito, beginning July 3, 1943. The last Hudson left the base on October 3 of that year. Supporting the Mosquito BCATP training were the Airspeed Oxford and Bristol Bolingbroke. The base also became home to North American Harvards and Lockheed Venturas.\n\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Greenwood, Nova Scotia at with a variation of 23 degrees west and elevation of . The field was listed as \"All hard surfaced\" and had three runways listed as follows:\nOn July 1, 1944, RAF Station Greenwood transitioned to the RCAF, becoming RCAF Station Greenwood with No. 36 OTU (RAF) disbanding and No. 8 OTU (RCAF) forming in its place. Under the RCAF, BCATP training continued unabated throughout the course of the Second World War, with a total of 57 airmen killed in 25 crashes between June 1942 and April 1945. The BCATP program was disbanded on March 31, 1945.\n\nA proposed British Commonwealth very long range (VLR) bomber group named \"Tiger Force\" was scaled down through the spring of 1945. Following VE Day on May 8, 1945, the RCAF units that were to be part of Tiger Force were converted to the Avro Lancaster and returned to Canada for training and reorganization as part of a planned Allied invasion of Japan (Operation Downfall).\n\nThe RCAF disbanded No. 8 OTU on July 31, 1945, and created No. 6614 Wing at RCAF Station Greenwood the following day on August 1, 1945, with plans for the bomber wing to start training August 24, 1945 and deploy its first Lancaster crews to the Pacific Theatre by December 1945. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and subsequent capitulation of Japan on August 14, 1945, resulted in No. 6614 Wing disbanding as part of Tiger Force on September 5, 1945.\n\nBetween the fall of 1945 and March 31, 1946, RCAF Station Greenwood maintained a nominal training complement of personnel and aircraft. Effective May 1, 1946, the base was mothballed with numerous buildings being closed. By the end of June the base was down to a skeleton staff of 72 personnel. RCAF Station Greenwood would remain this way until February 17, 1947.\n\nOn that date the RCAF's AFHQ Organization Order 854 was executed which activated RCAF Station Greenwood on April 1 of that year. RCAF 10 Group, Halifax announced in mid-October 1947 that No. 103 Rescue Unit would move from RCAF Station Dartmouth (now CFB Shearwater) to Greenwood by the end of the month. No. 103 RU had been conceived in January 1947 at RCAF Station Dartmouth to aid aircraft in distress on Trans-Atlantic service.\n\nBy October 29, 1947, 100-150 airmen and officers, 2 PBY Canso, 1 Noorduyn Norseman, and 1 Sikorsky S-51 helicopter. In September 1948, the No. 103 RU at RCAF Station Greenwood deployed a Lancaster and Canso to Goose Air Base to work with Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) units on a northern exercise, followed in October 1948 with participation in joint naval manoeuvres with the RCN and United States Navy (USN).\n\nThe Cold War was in its infancy during the late 1940s when Canada signed the North Atlantic Treaty with the western war-time Allies, becoming part of NATO. RCAF Station Greenwood was selected as Canada's site for a maritime reconnaissance training unit for anti-submarine warfare, the No. 2 Maritime (M) Operational Training Unit, and the nation's first operational squadron, 405 Squadron.\n\n2 (M) OTU became operational on December 12, 1949, the same day that 405 Squadron reactivated, using modified Avro Lancaster bombers as maritime reconnaissance aircraft. Part of 2 (M) OTU became 404 Squadron, the base's second operational maritime reconnaissance squadron on April 30, 1951, with the 2 (M) OTU continuing to train units at RCAF Station Greenwood.\n\nThe base was experiencing a crowding problem, thus the 2 (M) OTU was moved to RCAF Station Summerside in Prince Edward Island effective November 14, 1953. The Lockheed P2V Neptune replaced Greenwood's Lancasters beginning March 30, 1955 as the operational maritime reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nOn January 17, 1955, the No. 103 Rescue Unit received a Piasecki H-21/H-44, known as a \"flying banana\".\n\nThe first CP-107 Argus arrived at RCAF Station Greenwood on May 1, 1958. The No. 2 (Maritime) OTU at RCAF Station Summerside created the No. 2 (Maritime) OTU Detachment at Greenwood to train Argus aircrews. 405 Squadron became the first operational RCAF unit to receive the Argus in July 1958. On April 15, 1959 404 Squadron received its first Argus and on May 1, 1961, the 415 Squadron was reactivated at RCAF Station Summerside to become the third operational unit to fly the aircraft. The Neptunes at Greenwood were transferred to 407 Squadron at RCAF Station Comox starting in May 1958, replacing the last Lancasters.\n\nOn February 1, 1968, the RCN, RCAF and Canadian Army were unified into the Canadian Forces, and RCAF Station Greenwood name was changed to Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood.\n\nThat year many decisions were made that reduced duplication among the services, with various units being reorganized, moved, or disbanded. To alleviate further overcrowding at CFB Greenwood, 103 RU was moved to CFB Summerside.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, 6 of Greenwood's 18 Argus aircraft were mothballed and 242 personnel cut from all ranks. By the late 1970s, the Argus was identified as a candidate for replacement and the CP-140 Aurora was selected.\n\nIn September 1978, the Maritime Patrol and Evaluation Unit transferred from CFB Summerside. 415 Squadron flew the Argus out of CFB Summerside until the spring of 1981 when the unit transferred to Greenwood and converted to the Aurora.\n\nThe first Auroras replaced the Argus at Greenwood and Comox with 14 and 4 respectively. Greenwood received its first Aurora on May 27, 1980, and the last one arrived on July 10, 1981.\n\nThe 1989 federal budget cuts to the Department of National Defence identified CFB Summerside as a candidate for base closure. In 1991 the base was closed and the majority of military personnel were transferred to CFB Greenwood, with Summerside's only operational unit, 413 Squadron (successor to No. 103 RU) moving its CH-113 Labrador and CC-115 Buffalo aircraft on June 10, 1991; the Buffalo were replaced by the CC-130 Hercules shortly after 413 transferred.\n\nFurther defence cuts and reorganization in 1995 moved the 434 Squadron from CFB Shearwater to Greenwood, bringing its Canadair CE/CT-133 Silver Star and Canadair CC/CP/CE-144 Challenger combat support aircraft to the base. This squadron was disbanded on April 28, 2002.\n\nLater in 2002, 413 Squadron's CH-113 Labrador helicopters were replaced by the new CH-149 Cormorant, a version of the EH-101 helicopter.\n\nOn 9 January 2008, Defence Minister Peter MacKay appointed Canadian country singer-songwriter George Canyon to the position of honorary colonel at 14 Wing. In December 2011 Barb Stegemann replaced Canyon as honorary colonel of the wing. Dr. Terry Kelly, best known as a singer, songwriter, was appointed as the Honorary Colonel of 14 Wing Greenwood, N.S. in May 2015.\n\nToday CFB Greenwood remains Canada's largest operational air force base on the Atlantic coast, based on numbers of aircraft and personnel. The following aircraft types are permanently stationed at the base:\n\nWith CFB Gander and CFB Goose Bay, CFB Greenwood is being used as a forward deployment base for CF-188 Hornet fighter/interceptor aircraft rotating in from CFB Bagotville as part of NORAD's post-9/11 response to concerns about civilian airline security along North America's east coast.\n\nCFB Greenwood hosts a Royal Canadian Air Cadets summer training centre known as CTC Greenwood. CFB Greenwood is also the home of 517 Flight Lieutenant Graham Squadron, a local air cadet unit.\nIn 2016, members of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets began attending CSTC Greenwood. That same year, it was announced that the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets would also have summer training courses available at Greenwood effective 2017. CSTCs across Canada are also bringing in Cadets from other branches.\n\nUntil 2005, CFB Greenwood's airfield was home to the Greenwood Flying Club for civilian general aviation. The Greenwood Flying Club changed its name to the Greenwood Flight Centre and operated out of the Waterville/Kings County Municipal Airport, a small civilian airport located east of CFB Greenwood. Since the closure of the Kings County Municipal Airport in April 2016, civilian operations have moved back into CFB Greenwood. The civilian facilities are operated by Freedom Aviation with separate parking area and access to the airport runways. Use of the airport by civilian aircraft requires registration with Freedom Aviation to operate there or must obtain prior permission. These operations occur under a lease agreement between Canadian DND and the Municipality of Kings and the initial terms are for 25 years.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the leaders of a generation of Dutch cyclists in the late 1990s and early 2000s, together with teammate Erik Dekker.\n\nBoogerd began his professional career in , joining \"WordPerfect\". In the team changed name to \"Novell\", before Rabobank in became main sponsor and name for the team. Boogerd stayed with the team his entire career.\n\nHis speciality were hilly classics like Liège–Bastogne–Liège, La Flèche Wallonne and the Amstel Gold Race in the Ardennes week and the Lombardian races in the Fall, as well as mountain-stages. He has won two stages in Tour de France (, ) as well as the Amstel Gold Race and Paris–Nice. He has been Dutch Champion three times, in , and in . In addition to these major victories, Boogerd scored a large number of podium finishes in his favorite spring classics, which gave him a reputation in the Netherlands of being 2nd or 3rd more often than winning - a notion he dismissed in a 2007 interview looking back at his career.\n\nIn the 1998 Tour de France, Boogerd finished 5th overall in the General classification, his highest finish ever in the Tour de France. Boogerd was also fined 1250 Swiss Francs for not wearing his national champion jersey in the prologue of that year. His main result in the 2005 Tour de France was on stage 15, where he finished 4th, 57 seconds behind stage winner, George Hincapie. Also in the Tour de France 2005, he was punished with twenty seconds at Stage 9 of the race. In the 2006 Tour de France, Boogerd's role was to support Rabobank team leader Denis Menchov in the Alps and Pyrenees. He rode exceptionally well helping his team captain to 6th overall and Michael Rasmussen to the Polka Dot jersey.\n\nIn the 2007 Tour de France Boogerd rode, again, very well. This time his teammate Michael Rasmussen was the leader of the race until the latter was fired after the last stage in the Pyrenees. On the Thursday before the start of this Tour, Boogerd infused himself with water in the early morning, before the UCI agents could arrive. His hematocrit level namely was 50, \"on the edge of the edge\". During the Tour, Boogerd and Thomas Dekker used cortisone (Diprofos) under a fake attest every day, and administered eight times 2000 entities of Dynepo.\n\nBoogerd ended his career in 2007, with a 12th place in the World Championship road race in Stuttgart. His planned last race was the 2007 Giro di Lombardia, but a fall in the weeks before made him unable to participate.\n\nAfter his active career, Boogerd has done freelance promotional activities for Rabobank, and is frequently seen or heard on TV during live coverage of major races, both on Dutch and Belgian television.\n\nBoogerd was appointed team manager of Team Roompot, a UCI Professional Continental cycling team launching in 2015.\n\nAllegations that Boogerd used performance-enhancing drugs were made since at least 2008, when Bernhard Kohl, who had finished third in the 2008 Tour de France but was stripped of that honor after testing positive for CERA, a variant of EPO accused his manager Stefan Matschiner. Matschiner, in turn, named a number of athletes whom he had supplied with drugs and blood transfusions, including Boogerd (whose name appeared in Matschiner's files). Until early 2013, Boogerd continued to deny. He finally admitted, in a television interview on 6 March 2013 (seen by nearly a million viewers), to having used EPO, blood transfusions and cortisone from 1997 to 2007. In October 2014, he was approached by the Belgian federation, allegedly to offer him to shorten his proposed ban in exchange for naming other dopers and he answered this: \"The Belgian federation had the same proposal as the Dutch Doping Authority had. I will be suspended for a long period, or I will have to talk about other people. I refuse to do that. I rather be suspended for life\". In January 2016 he received a two-year suspension and his results from 2005 to 2007 were annulled.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has been augmented with complementary lists that include various other classes of hosts, allowing for customized email rejection by its users.\n\nThe SORBS DNSbl project was created in November 2002. It was maintained as a private list until 6 January 2003 when the DNSbl was officially launched to the public. The list consisted of 78,000 proxy relays and rapidly grew to over 3,000,000 alleged compromised spam relays.\n\nIn November 2009 SORBS was acquired by GFI Software, to enhance their mail filtering solutions.\n\nIn July 2011 SORBS was re-sold to Proofpoint, Inc.\n\nSORBS adds IP ranges that belong to dialup modem pools, dynamically allocated wireless, and DSL connections as well as DHCP LAN ranges by using reverse DNS PTR records, WHOIS records, and sometimes by submission from the ISPs themselves. This is called the DUHL or Dynamic User and Host List. SORBS does not automatically rescan DUHL listed hosts for updated rDNS so to remove an IP address from the DUHL the user or ISP has to request a delisting or rescan. If other blocks are scanned in the region of listings and the scan includes listed netspace, SORBS automatically removes the netspace marked as \"static\".\n\nMatthew Sullivan of SORBS proposed in an Internet Draft that generic reverse DNS addresses include purposing tokens such as \"static\" or \"dynamic\", abbreviations thereof, and more. That naming scheme would have allowed end users to classify IP addresses without the need to rely on third party lists, such as the SORBS DUHL. The Internet Draft has since expired. Generally it is considered more appropriate for ISPs to simply block outgoing traffic to port 25 if they wish to prevent users from sending email directly, rather than specifying it in the reverse DNS record for the IP.\n\nSORBS' dynamic IP list originally came from Dynablock but has been developed independently since Dynablock stopped updating in December 2003.\n\nNote that there is no mechanism that allows a third party to check whether an IP address was dynamically assigned, so there is no way to verify whether a listed IP really belongs to a dynamically assigned range. It is not uncommon to find IPs listed as dynamic that are actually being statically assigned by the ISP. Also note that the DUHL list does not detect SPAM, or suspicious activity, so it would be advisable to never block mail just because an IP is listed there, but as part of a more complex and intelligent anti-spam check.\n\nIP addresses that send spam to SORBS spamtraps are added to their spam database automatically or manually. In order to prevent being blacklisted, major free email services such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail, as well as major ISPs now implement outgoing anti-spam countermeasures. Gmail, for example, continues to get listed and delisted because they refuse abuse reports. However, smaller networks may still be unwittingly blocked. Because spammers use viruses, malware, and rootkits to force compromised computers to send spam, SORBS lists the IP addresses of servers that the infected system uses to send its spam. Because of this, larger ISPs and corporate networks have started blocking port 25 in order to prevent these compromised computers from being able to send email except through designated email servers.\n\nSORBS maintains a list of networks and addresses that it believes are assigned dynamically to end users/machines, it refers to this list as the DUHL (Dynamic User/Host List). The list includes wide networks of computers sharing the same IP address using network address translation which are also affected (If one computer behind the NAT is allowed to send spam, the whole network will be blacklisted if the NAT IP is ever blacklisted.) This is a common method of pre-emptive blocking as most legitimate mail servers are hosted in data centers designed and provisioned for such services, the legitimate mail servers that are affected by such listings are most commonly home hobbyists running their own mail servers. The Spamhaus Policy Block List (PBL) is another such pre-emptive list which does not just list dynamic hosts, but also blocks hosts it believes should not be sending email directly to third-party servers. SORBS also operate another list which is similar to the Spamhaus PBL called the NoServers list, which is wholly maintained by the network administrators of the respective networks and is therefore theoretically False Positive free.\n\nSORBS has been accused of deliberately targeting innocent users through escalated listings. Its website describes the process as follows: \"An escalated listing on the other hand is where a whole network of IP addresses is listed in SORBS and all hosts and IPs (whether assigned to a single customer or multiple) are listed and therefore blocked or result in spam folder issues. Why does SORBS create escalated listings? The simple answer is to stop spam. You ask, 'How does listing innocent IPs help stop spam?' Simple, some providers don’t care about spam.\" There have been many heated discussions on this practice as often it would appear that email users who are caught in this trap have no recourse, because the listing applies to a block of IP addresses, and they are unable to release their own IP address.\n\nDue to the automation of spamtraps SORBS regularly lists the addresses of legitimate mail servers. Therefore, SORBS should not be configured as a single blocking test in a spam filter, but in combination with other spam indicators.\n\nSince the acquisition by Proofpoint, Inc. full-time support staff have been employed to answer delisting queries; however the first round of answers to support requests are answered automatically by robot systems.\n\nSORBS produces and publishes daily statistics about its list to the otherwise defunct usenet newsgroup news.admin.net-abuse.bulletins (NANAB). As of the Dec 13, 2017 statistics published show the following listing totals:\n\n"}

He played an instrumental role in the establishment of national rights for Romanians in Transylvania (part of the Habsburg Monarchy at the time of his life). \n\nHe was born as \"Ioan Micu\" (\"Inocențiu\" being his clergy name, and \"Klein\" the German translation of his surname, sometimes rendered back into Romanian transcription as \"Clain\") in Sadu, nowadays in Sibiu County, in 1692 from a lower-class family. He studied by the Jesuits in Cluj and trained in theology in Trnava.\n\nOn 18 November 1728, following the death of previous bishop Ioan Giurgiu Patachi, the electoral synod convened and Micu resulted the more voted, even if he was young and he had not yet terminated his studies. Accordingly, on 12 July 1729 the Habsburg monarch, Emperor Charles VI, designated him as new bishop of Făgăraș. \nOn 5 September 1729 he was awarded the title of \"Baron\", and on 23 September of that year, Micu became a priest and immediately he joined the Basilian Order. Pope Clement XII confirmed him on 11 September 1730, and accordingly he was consecrated a bishop on 5 November 1730 by Gennadius Bizanczy, the Eparch of Mukachevo. From Mukachevo he moved to Vienna, where he pleaded the Emperor for the rights of Transylvanian people. He made his formal enthronement in Făgăraș on 28 September 1732, and, following his insistence, on 11 December 1732 he was given a seat in the Transylvanian Diet.\n\nImmediately after his enthronement, he summoned an ecclesiastic synod which issued 20 decrees on administrative, disciplinary, sacramentary issues. In 1737, he moved the bishopric seat from Făgăraș to Blaj, and laid the foundations to the local cathedral in 1741.\nAs a member of the Diet (Parliament) of Transylvania, Inocențiu Micu began to press the Habsburg Monarchy to fulfill the Agreement that conversion to Greek Catholicism would bring with it Roman Catholic-like privileges for Romanian inhabitants also, and an end to serfdom.\n\nFirst pressing for rights for clergy and converts, he soon began to petition for freedom for all Romanians. Micu petitioned the Habsburg court for over forty years to this end. His perseverance ultimately made both the Austrian Empress Maria Theresia and Transylvania's Diet declare themselves offended - the Hungarian majority in the Diet opposed the liberation of the work force or the awarding of political rights to Romanians (Vlachs), considered by the Diet as \"\"moth for the cloth\"\". \n\nExiled in 1744, Micu moved to Rome and he had to resign a few years later, on 7 May 1751. He died in Rome 17 years later, on 22 September 1768.\n\n"}

She serves as a member of Batman's team Outsiders.\n\nNightstar first appears in \"Kingdom Come\" #1 (May 1996) when she is seen in a street battle. Nightstar's mother Koriand'r had died from a circulatory illness. Most of the supervillains of the world have been eliminated so the new generation of heroes \"fight simply to fight, their only foes each other\". Nightstar and others are battling it out, causing destruction in the neighbourhood and getting innocents caught in the crossfire. They only pause to learn of a major disaster in the state of Kansas in which a similar battle has led to the deaths of one million people.\n\nSuperman, who has been in self-imposed exile, returns to reform the Justice League and restore order. Among his recruits is Nightstar's father Dick Grayson, who adopts the identity of Red Robin. Nightstar is at first very dismissive of this move.\n\nShe is next seen in conversation with Avia, daughter of Mister Miracle and Big Barda in an underground bar. Superman appears and makes a powerful recruitment speech for the Justice League. Nightstar is impressed but, unlike Avia, she does not fall in with Superman.\n\nInstead she throws in with Batman, who, through Dick Grayson, is her adopted grandfather. So do many other progeny of the Leaguers, including the daughters of Speedy, Aqualad and Flash and the son of Donna Troy.\n\nBatman, who no longer uses the cover of his alter-ego Bruce Wayne, has formed an alliance with Lex Luthor's Mankind Liberation Front in order to counter what they see as the overbearing might of the Justice League. During a meeting between their groups, Nightstar encounters Ibn Al Xu'ffasch, Batman's son but also the heir to the Dark Knight's enemy Ra's al Ghul. The moment they meet, Nightstar and Ibn have an undisguised attraction for one another.\n\nBatman's real agenda however is to expose Luthor and his schemes to cause more chaos to the world. Just as Luthor is about to unleash this chaos, Batman and his followers overpower him and his associates—with the notable exception of Ibn, who is later seen arm in arm with Nightstar.\n\nThe League has built a special prison to hold rebellious superhumans, but the prison is breached and an all-out battle ensues between the prisoners and the Leaguers. Batman's Outsiders join in the fight, during which Red Robin (Richard Grayson) is seriously injured by an enemy called 666. Nightstar, who has been fighting Green Lantern, gasps in horror as this happens, screams in agony as she cradles her father's bloodied face, and then flies him off to safety.\n\nWayne Manor is later converted into a hospital where the victims from the battle are treated. Nightstar oversees a reconciliation between her father and grandfather.\n\nJustice Society of America (vol. 3) #22 (2009) reveals that she would eventually marry Ibn Al Xu'ffasch and have a daughter and son.\n\nIn \"The Kingdom\", the mini-series that serves as a sequel to \"Kingdom Come\", her name is revealed to be Mar'i. Mary is the name of her paternal grandmother, Mary Loyd Grayson. She is also shown to be a leader of her generation, an active Titan whom others look to for inspiration and solution, a role once filled by her father Richard Grayson.\n\nDuring the series and related events, Nightstar becomes part of a small super-team investigating reality disturbances in Planet Krypton, a restaurant owned by Booster Gold. This leads to a battle with \"Gog\" and the eventual discovery of Hypertime.\n\nIn \"The Kingdom: Nightstar\", it is revealed that she has an interest in botany, a fear of death, and works with security at Green Lantern Alan Scott's space station The Green.\n\nLike her mother, Nightstar is capable of atmospheric flight, has super-strength, super speed, endurance and it can absorb star energy to project in powerful bursts. Her eyes are green and pupilless.

{"id": "2065003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065003", "title": "Triple play (telecommunications)", "text": "Triple play (telecommunications)\n\nIn telecommunications, triple play service is a marketing term for the provisioning, over a single broadband connection, of two bandwidth-intensive services, broadband Internet access and television, and the latency-sensitive telephone. Triple play focuses on a supplier convergence rather than solving technical issues or a common standard. However, standards like G.hn might deliver all these services on a common technology.\n\nA so-called quadruple play (or quad play) service integrates mobility as well, often by supporting dual mode mobile plus hotspot-based phones that shift from GSM to Wi-Fi when they come in range of a home wired for triple-play service. Typical Generic Access Network services of this kind, such as Rogers Home Calling Zone (Rogers is an incumbent in the Canadian market), allow the caller to enter and leave the range of their home Wi-Fi network, and only pay GSM rates for the time they spend outside the range. Calls at home are routed over the IP network and paid at a flat rate per month. No interruption or authorization for the shift is required—soft handoff takes place automatically as many times as the caller enters or leaves the range.\n\nBy about 2000, cable TV companies were in a technical position to offer \"triple play\" over one physical medium to a large number of their customers, as their networks already had sufficient bandwidth to carry hundreds of video channels. Cable's main competition for television in North America came from satellites, which could not compete for voice and interactive broadband due to the latency imposed by physical laws on a geosynchronous satellite—sometimes up to one full second of delay between speaking and being heard. Cable's main competition for voice and Internet access came from telcos, which were not yet able to compete for television in most markets because DSL over most local loops could not provide enough bandwidth.\n\nAs an interim marketing move while they installed fiber closer to the customer, telcos such as AT&T did co-promotion deals with satellite TV providers to sell television, telephone, and Internet access services bundled for billing purposes, although the services provided through a satellite link and the services provided through a phone line are not technically related. Telcos that own wireless phone networks also included those as part of such billing-only bundles because most cable companies do not own wireless networks.\n\nThe first triple-play deployment was by the US operator Cox Communications in 1997, delivered via a Hybrid fiber-coaxial network using digital and analog TV set top boxes, digital telephony devices from Arris International, and a cable modem system from Motorola.\n\nTriple-play services in the United States are offered by cable television operators as well as by telecommunication operators, who directly compete with one another. Providers expect that an integrated solution will increase opportunity costs for customers who may want to choose between service providers, permit more cross-selling, and hold off the power companies deploying G.hn and IEEE P1901 technology with its radically superior service and deployment characteristics for at least another decade or so.\n\nOutside the United States, notably in Ecuador, Pakistan, India, Japan, and China, power companies have generally been more successful in leapfrogging legacy technologies. In Switzerland and Sweden, dark fiber is available reliably to homes at tariffed rates (in Switzerland four dark fibres are deployed to each home) supporting speeds in excess of 40 Gbit/s—only to the local caches, however, as backhaul cannot typically support more than 10 Mbit/s connections to global services.\n\nSince 2007, access providers in Italy have been participating in an initiative called Fiber for Italy, which aims to build an infrastructure that can deliver 100 Mbit/s symmetrical bandwidth to consumers, in order to enable the delivery of triple- and quad-play services.\n\nOther triple-play deployments include Deutsche Telekom, Vmedia, Telecom Italia, Swisscom, Telekom Austria, and Telus.\n\nThere are multiple and intense regulatory battles over triple-play services, as incumbent telcos and incumbent cable operators attempt to keep out new competitors; since both industries historically have been regulated monopolies, regulatory capture has long been as much a core competency for them as have been prices and terms of service. Cable providers want to compete with telcos for local voice service, but want to discourage telcos from competing with them for television service. Incumbent telcos want to deliver television service but want to block competition for voice service from cable operators. Both industries cloak their demands for favorable regulatory treatment in claims that their positions favor the public interests.\n\nIn March 2007 cable operators scored a major victory when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) overruled two state public service commissions by ruling that incumbent local exchange carriers must connect to VoIP services . Regulators in South Carolina and Nebraska had been allowing local telcos to block Time Warner Cable from offering local phone service in their states. In the other direction, also in March 2007, the FCC limited the powers of municipalities and states over telcos that want to compete with cable TV companies. Consumer groups expressed displeasure with this FCC ruling because they fear telcos will only offer service to the richest neighborhoods, which is a major point of contention between telcos wanting to offer television service and local governments is that local governments typically impose \"build-out\" and community access requirements so a cable provider is forced to wire the entire town within a specified period of time. All three Republican members of the FCC voted for this decision, while both Democratic members voted against it and one predicted either U.S. Congress or the courts would overturn it. In October 2007, The \"Hartford Courant\" reported that Connecticut regulators have ordered AT&T to stop signing up new customers for its IPTV service until they got a cable license; AT&T said they would fight this decision in court .\n\nFor telephone local exchange carriers (LEC), \"triple play\" is delivered using a combination of optical fiber and digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies (called fiber in the loop) to its residential base. This configuration uses fiber communications to reach distant locations and uses DSL over an existing POTS twisted pair cable as last mile access to the subscriber's home. Cable television operators use a similar architecture called hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) to provide subscriber homes with broadband, but use the available coaxial cable rather than a twisted pair for the last mile transmission standard. Subscriber homes can be in a residential environment, multi-dwelling units, or even in business offices.\n\nUsing DSL over twisted pair, television content is delivered using IPTV where the content is streamed to the subscriber in an MPEG-2 transport format. On an HFC network, television may be a mixture of analog and digital television signals. A set-top box (STB) is used at the subscriber's home to allow the subscriber to control viewing and order new video services such as \"movies on demand\". Access to the Internet is provided through ATM or DOCSIS, typically provided as an Ethernet port to the subscriber. Voice service can be provided using a traditional plain old telephone service (POTS) interface as part of the legacy telephone network or can be delivered using voice over IP (VoIP). In an HFC network, voice is delivered using VoIP.\n\nSome service providers are also rolling out Ethernet to the home networks and fiber to the home, which support triple-play services and bypass the disadvantages of adapting broadband transmission to a legacy network. This is particularly common in greenfield developments where the capital expenditure is reduced by deploying one network to deliver all services.\n\nFor existing multiple-dwelling-unit (MDU) buildings, where running fiber to each unit may not be feasible, telcos often use VDSL to connect individual units over existing copper through a central optical network terminal located in the existing telco closet. Over such a short distance, DSL can deliver much higher bitrates than is possible running DSL over the local loop from the nearest central office (as is common with basic DSL).\n\n\"Triple play\" has led to the term \"quadruple play\", where wireless communications is introduced as another medium to deliver video, Internet access, and voice telephone service. Advances in both CDMA and GSM standards, utilizing 3G, 4G, or UMTS allows the service operators to enter into quadruple play and gain competitive advantage against other providers. The grouping together of services (as triple or quadruple play) is called multi-play.\n\nOther advanced technologies such as WiMax or 802.16 has allowed new market entrants to achieve triple play. Many speculate that this means serious, new competition for established providers of bundled telecommunications services.\n\nThese services can be delivered with a BPL network using technologies such as IEEE P1901/G.hn. Since the devices all rely on AC power (or DC power via 802.3af or 802.3at which rely on AC power at the PoE hub), connecting them with only one cable each for both power and gigabit data cuts wiring costs, and most rooms are already wired for power.\n\nThe challenges in offering \"triple play\" are mostly associated with determining the right business model, backend processes, customer care support, and economic environment, rather than technology. For example, using the right billing platform to address a variety of subscriber demographics or having the appropriate subscriber density to financially justify introduction of the service are a few factors that affect decisions to offer triple play.\n\nIn addition to the challenges mentioned above, there are a number of technical challenges with regards to the rollout of triple-play services. Voice, video, and high-speed data all have different characteristics and place different burdens on the network that provides access to these services. Voice services are greatly affected by jitter, whereas packet loss has a greater effect on video and data services. In order to use a shared network resource such as cable or DSL, the service provider may use network equipment that employs quality-of-service mechanisms to adjust to the requirements of the different services.\n\n\n"}

For example, if a person dies without a will, his or her heirs are determined by operation of law. Similarly, if a person marries or has a child after his or her will has been written, the law writes this pretermitted spouse or pretermitted heir into the will if no provision for this situation was specifically included. Adverse possession, in which title to land passes because non-owners have occupied it for a certain period of time, is another important right that vests by operation of law.\n\nEvents that occur by operation of law do so because courts have determined over time that the rights thus created or transferred represent what the intent of the party would have been, had they thought about the situation in advance; or because the results fulfilled the settled expectations of parties with respect to their property; or because legal instruments of title provide for these transfers to occur automatically on certain named contingencies.\n\nRights that arise by operation of law often arise by design of certain contingencies set forth in a legal instrument. If a life estate is created in a tract of land, and the person by whose life the estate is measured dies, title to the property reverts to the original grantor – or, possibly, to the grantor's legal heirs – by operation of law. Nothing needs to be put in writing to affirm that this will happen. Joint tenants with rights of survivorship create a similar situation. Joint tenants with rights of survivorship deeds are always taken in equal shares, and when one joint tenant dies, the other tenants equally acquire title by virtue of the terms of the conveyance itself, by operation of law.\n\nRights or liabilities created by operation of law can also be created involuntarily, because a contingency occurs for which a party has failed to plan (e.g. failure to write a will); or because a specific condition exists for a set period of time (e.g. adverse possession of property or creation of an easement; failure of a court to rule on a motion within a certain period automatically defeating the motion; failure of a party to act on a filed complaint within a certain time causing dismissal of the case); or because an existing legal relationship is invalidated, but the parties to that relationship still require a mechanism to distribute their rights (e.g. under the Uniform Commercial Code, where a contract for which both parties have performed partially is voided, the court will create a new contract based on the performance that has actually been rendered and containing reasonable terms to accommodate the expectations of the parties).\n\nBecause title to property that arises by operation of law is usually contingent upon proof of certain contingencies, and title records may not contain evidence of those contingencies, legal proceedings are sometimes required to turn title that arises by operation of law into marketable title.\n"}

It is one of three stations in Barry. This one, Barry Town, is preceded by Barry Docks and Cadoxton stations on the Barry Branch which runs from Cardiff Central to a fourth station at Barry Island, the terminus. Barry is also the junction at the start of the Vale of Glamorgan Line which serves Rhoose and Llantwit Major and terminates at .\n\nPassenger services are operated by Transport For Wales as part of the Valley Lines network.\n\nAlthough Barry station was the terminus of the original Barry Railway, it was not among the first stations to open. The first passenger services ran between Cogan and Barry Docks starting on 20 December 1888 along the line known as the Cogan branch; the main line ran from Cadoxton South Junction to Trehafod in the Rhondda. The extension of services to Barry did not happen until 8 February 1889. It remained a terminus for Cardiff services until the Barry Railway became a constituent member of the Great Western Railway in 1922. However, the line was extended to Barry Island on 3 August 1896 and a good proportion of the passenger trains terminated there. Barry was also the terminus of the Vale of Glamorgan Railway which opened on 1 December 1897 though was operated by the Barry Railway.\n\nTrains ran from Bridgend where the Barry Railway had its own platform and passengers wishing to travel to Cardiff had to change trains at Barry. The Vale of Glamorgan branch was closed to passengers on 15 June 1964 but after much demand, was successfully re-opened on 10 June 2005 with Rhoose station also providing a bus link to Cardiff International Airport. Both Rhoose and Llantwit Major station platforms were re-established in a different form with staggered platforms at Rhoose and opposite each other at Llantwit Major and with a pedestrian footbridge linking them.\n\nThe station has a staffed ticket office (on platform 1), which is open six days per week from early morning until mid-afternoon (Monday to Friday: 06:50–13:20, Saturday: 07:45–14:15). A ticket machine is available for use outside these times and for collecting pre-paid tickets. A waiting room is available in the main building when the station is staffed, with a shelter on the island platform. Other amenities include a cafe, payphone and toilets. Train running information is offered via CIS displays, automated announcements, a help point on platform 1 and timetable posters.\nAs at October 2019, step-free access is limited to platform 1, as the only route to platforms 2 and 3 is via a stepped footbridge. Disabled passengers are advised to travel to Barry station via Barry Island if arriving from Cardiff or if wishing to travel to Barry Island from Barry, to travel first to Barry Docks or if from Bridgend, to alight at Barry Docks station and change platforms for Barry Island. To alleviate the problem of disabled persons or persons with heavy luggage having to use the stations in this way, by October 2019 it was planned to provide a new footbridge with combined lifts at Barry station by 2020 and at Cadoxton such a provision was almost complete by October 2019, where only a subway had been the means of crossing between platforms after June 1964 due to a foot crossing previously being provided but removed for safety reasons. (The same had applied at Barry station).\n\nThe station has a basic four trains per hour service (Mon-Sat) to eastbound and three per hour to Barry Island and one per hour to westbound. Eastbound trains usually continue beyond Cardiff Central to either or (half-hourly to each).\n\nOn Sundays, there are either 2 or 3 trains per hour to Cardiff Central (one each hour continuing to either Merthyr or Aberdare plus one every other hour to ), half-hourly trains to Barry Island and one every two hours to Bridgend.\n\nServices are mainly operated by Class 150 \"Sprinter\" units, as well as Class 142 \"Pacer\" units and Class 143 \"Pacer\" units, which usually operate in pairs to form a 4-car service.\n\nAs part of a £200m regeneration scheme to boost train capacity in Cardiff and the surrounding areas, Barry now has a third platform (Platform 3) which is now only used by down or sometimes up trains to & from Barry Island. \n\nUp trains can and still do use the Barry station up platform (1) generally but as the new platform line is now bi-directional and signalled as such, it is also sometimes used for up passenger trains which can start from here if a 'catch-up' in the timetable is required, thereby cutting out a reversal at Barry Island. The laying of the bi-directional platform line had to be performed while essential signal wires and point rodding lying 1.75m from the platform wall, was still in place. The 'new' platform support blockwork was thus constructed so that its finished edge now lies 2.75m from the former obsolete platform edge.\n\nDuring the months of construction, Barry signal box was taken out of use making the signal pull-wires and point rodding redundant and by week ending 28 March 2014, the box was demolished. Having removed the latter components, the void between old and new platform edges was backfilled, tarmacked over and new coping platform stones laid.\n\nPrior to 1964, this platform was that of platform 4, platform 1 previously being the Bay platform where trains to Pontypridd via Wenvoe or sometimes Cardiff started. That area is now a Park & Ride facility. Platform 1 serves all up trains to Cardiff and beyond from either Barry Island or Bridgend. Platform 2 now serves only trains to Bridgend as the line to Barry Island from the junction south of platform 2 was curtailed during the remodelling project and acts as a safety overrun with a buffer stop 100m from the down facing points.\n"}

{"id": "2065063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065063", "title": "Third order", "text": "Third order\n\nThe term \"Third Order\" signifies, in general, lay members of religious orders, who do not necessarily live in community and yet can claim to wear the habit and participate in the good works of some great order. Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, and Lutheranism all recognize Third Orders. They were a twelfth-century adaptation of the medieval monastic confraternities.\n\nMembers of third orders, are known as tertiaries (Latin \"tertiarii\", from \"tertius\", third). In some cases, they may belong to a religious institute (a \"congregation\") that is called a \"third order regular\".\n\nRoman Catholic canon law states: \"Associations whose members share in the spirit of some religious institute while in secular life, lead an apostolic life, and strive for Christian perfection under the higher direction of the same institute are called third orders or some other appropriate name.\"\n\nReligious orders that arose in the 12th-13th centuries often had a \"first order\" (the male religious, who were generally the first established), the \"second order\" (nuns, established second), and then the \"third order\" of laity who were established third. Saint Francis of Assisi, for example, is said to have established the Friars Minor, the Poor Clares, and the Third Order of Saint Francis.\n\nThe name \"tertiary\" comes from the Latin tertiarius meaning basically \"third\". Hence it has been used for centuries to denote those who belonged to a third order. Tertiaries are those persons who live according to the Third Rule of religious orders, either outside of a monastery in the world, or in a religious community. The idea which forms the basis of this institute is in general this: that persons who on account of certain circumstances cannot enter a religious order, strictly so-called, may, nevertheless, as far as possible enjoy the advantages and privileges of religious orders. This is most clearly expressed in the Rule of the Third Order of St. Francis which, although not the oldest, has, nevertheless, become the model for the rule of almost all other Third Orders. Tertiaries are divided into Regular and Secular.\n\nIn some cases the members of a third order, wishing to live in a more monastic and regulated way of life, became \"regulars\" (religious living under a rule, in Latin, \"regula\") as members of a religious institute. These religious institutes or \"congregations\" are classified as belonging to the third order \"regular\".\n\nThe old monastic orders had attached to their abbeys confraternities of lay men and women, going back in some cases to the 8th century. The \"Confraternity Book of Durham\" is extant and embraces some 20,000 names in the course of eight centuries. Emperors and kings and the most illustrious men in church and state were commonly confraters of one or other of the great Benedictine abbeys. The confraters and consorors were made partakers in all the religious exercises and other good works of the community to which they were affiliated, and they were expected in return to protect and forward its interests; but they were not called upon to follow any special rule of life.\n\nThe general idea of lay people affiliated to religious orders, such as the Benedictine Oblates or confraters developed as founders and benefactors of monasteries were received into spiritual fellowship, and later clothed in death in some religious habit. So too the Templars had a whole system whereby layfolk could partake in some sort in their privileges and in the material administration of their affairs. But the essential nature of the tertiary is really an innovation of the thirteenth century.\n\nAt that date many of the laity, impatient of the indolent and sometimes scandalous lives of the clergy in lower Europe, were seized with the idea of reforming Christendom by preaching. This admirable intention caused the rise of among others, the Fratres Humiliati. The Humiliati soon became suspect and were forbidden by Pope Lucius III to preach, until in 1207 Pope Innocent III gave a section of them permission to resume their work, provided that they limited themselves to moral questions and did not venture on doctrinal subjects. Some became priests, were gathered into a cloister, and took up religious life. Others remained outside, yet spiritually dependent on the clerical portion, and for the first time called a Third Order. The Humiliati seem to have been the first to have 'tertiaries' in the twelfth century. These lived a rule of life within the world.\n\nThe name was used to a great extent in the Franciscan Order, which possibly had the most popular third order. Other orders too had tertiaries such as the Trinitarians and the Dominicans. These were followed over time by a number of others such as the Carmelites, Servites, Augustinians, Augustinian Recollects, Discalced Carmelites and others. But by whatever name they were called in the inception, there have been lay persons who have professed to live according to either the Rule of the brothers adapted to their secular life or a rule drawn up particularly for them. They shared the same spirituality, the same superiors, and even aspects of the same habit such as the scapular. Eventually, the name \"tertiary\" became popularized and attached to all who lived in this way. There have been a number of beatified or canonized tertiaries.\n\nWith the advent of the Second Vatican Council came an elaboration of the lay vocation. The lay vocation is a vocation distinct from that of the consecrated state. It involves the sanctification of ordinary life, of one's work, of family life, of all the various secular occupations. It is the leaven in the midst of the world to order the temporal world to God.\n\nAs the various third orders secular began to look at each of their houses after the Council they began to revise their Rules and Statutes. The Orders submitted their new Statutes or Rules or Constitutions to the Holy See for review and approbation. Thus the new Statutes etc. are steeped in the doctrine of the Council regarding the universal call to holiness and the theology of the lay vocation including the secular character of the laity. Various Orders have opted to change the name from \"Third Order Secular\" to \"Secular Order\" (or at least add it to usage) to emphasize the secular nature of the Order or they used the term \"Lay or Laity\" to the same effect. \"Third order\" and \"tertiary\" is still used but other names were added or used in a formal sense. The various documents show how the laity of the various Orders are part of the Order (or family etc.) but fully within their particular lay and secular state. They show how tertiaries are to live fully their Christian lay vocation, as well as how they are to live the charism of the Order they belong to within secular life. They also provide various means to tending towards holiness in the midst of the world, which very much is part of the vocation of the tertiary—to strive for Christian perfection (CIC 303).\n\n\nThere also are third or secular orders in the Protestant denominations, such as the Anglican and Episcopal Church.\n\nMembers of third orders are thus either (a) \"regulars\", living in common under a religious rule of life, or (b) \"seculars\", living in the world. The regulars take the three canonical religious vows; the seculars make \"promises\", which are not considered binding under pain of sin, as are the vows of religious institutes, or in some cases may take \"private vows\" of obedience and chastity or in some cases even poverty, chastity and obedience (all according to their lay state). Their link with a religious institute is what distinguishes them from members of other \"associations of the Christian faithful\" and entitles their associations to be \"called third orders or some other appropriate name\".\n\nAny Roman Catholic or Anglican may join a Third Order of their respective religious tradition. The laying aside of the distinctive sign or prayers for any space of time does not in itself put an end to membership with a Third Order, but the deliberate wish to dissociate oneself from it is sufficient to produce that effect (S. Cong. Indulg., 31 January 1893).\n\nThe Third Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (also named Lay Carmelites) are the third order associated with the Carmelites. It was established in 1476 by a bull of Pope Sixtus IV and is known for devotion to Virgin Mary, under her title as Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\n\nThe Discalced branch is termed Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites.\n\nThe Trinitarian Family is composed of the Brothers, Sisters and Laity who bear the name of the Trinity as titular and recognize John of Matha as father.\n\nThe Order of the Most Holy Trinity was founded to ransom Christian Captives (especially those in danger of renouncing their faith). The Motto of the Order expresses well the charism of the order: \"Glory to the Most Holy Trinity and Liberty to Captives\". There have been \"tertiaries\" of the \"Order of the Most Holy Trinity and of the Captives\" since the beginnings of the Order though they were not known by that name. Lay \"confreres\" were admitted already in 1199 by the permission of Pope Innocent III. Statutes attributed to William the Scotsman, the third Minister General of the Order (1217–1222), give some idea of the primitive organization of the Trinitarian Fraternity.\n\nThe first known \"Statutes of the Trinitarian Third Order\" were published in 1584, and were approved by the General of the Order, Father Bernard Dominici. The first \"Rule of Life\" for the Third Order attached to the Discalced Trinitarians was approved by Pope Leo XII on 6 June 1828.\n\nThe Third Order of St. Francis in the Roman Catholic Church is part of the Franciscan family of religious orders. It is the best known and most widely distributed of the third orders, and has both regular and secular branches.\n\nThe preaching of St. Francis of Assisi, as well as his own living example and that of his first disciples, exercised such a powerful attraction on the people that many married men and women wanted to join the First or the Second Order. This being incompatible with their state of life, St. Francis found a middle way: he gave them a rule animated by the Franciscan spirit.\n\nWhen the immediate disciples of the saint had become an order bound by the religious vows, it became necessary to provide for the great body of laity, married men and women, who could not leave the world or abandon their avocations, but still were part of the Franciscan movement and desired to carry out in their lives its spirit and teaching. And so, probably in 1221, St. Francis drew up a Rule for those of his followers who were debarred from being members of the order of Friars Minor. At first they were called \"Brothers and Sisters of the Order of Penance\"; but later on, when the Friars were called the \"First Order\" and the nuns the \"Second Order,\" the Order of Penance became the \"Third Order of St. Francis\" whence the name Tertiaries: this threefold division already existed among the Humiliati. Nicholas IV introduced unity of rule and of direction into the Third Order, which henceforward was entrusted to the care of the Friars Minor.\n\nImmediately on its establishment in 1221 the Third Order spread rapidly all over Italy and throughout western Europe, and embraced multitudes of men and women of all ranks from highest to lowest. Everywhere it was connected closely with the First Order, and was under the control of the Friars Minor.\n\nIn time a tendency set in for members of the Third Order to live together in community, and in this way congregations were formed who took the usual religious vows and lived a fully organized religious life based on the Rule of the Third Order with supplementary regulations. These congregations are the Regular Tertiaries as distinguished from the Secular Tertiaries, who lived in the world, according to the original idea. The Regular Tertiaries are in the full technical sense religious, and there have been, and are, many congregations of them, both of men and of women.\n\nThere can be little doubt, whatever counter claims may be set up, that the Third Order was one of St. Francis' creations, and that his Third Order was the exemplar after which the others were fashioned; but at an early date the other Mendicant Orders formed Third Orders on the same lines, and so there came into being Dominican Tertiaries, and Carmelite, and Augustinian, and Servite, and also Premonstratensian and many others. These followed the same lines of development as the Franciscan Tertiaries, and for the most part divided into the two branches of regular and secular Tertiaries. The Rules of the various Third Orders have proved very adaptable to the needs of modern congregations devoted to active works of charity; and so a great number of teaching and nursing congregations of women belong to one or other of the Third Orders.\n\nThe Franciscan Third Order has always been the principal one, and it received a great impetus and a renewed vogue from Pope Leo XIII in 1883, in his approval of a new Rule for the seculars. Pope Paul VI in 1978 caused the separate Rules for both regulars and seculars to be recast and made more suitable for the requirements of devout men and women at the present day. The secular wing of the Order was renamed as the Secular Franciscan Order. It is estimated that the number of lay Franciscan Tertiaries now exceeds two million.\n\nThe origin of the Regular Third Order, both male and female, can be traced back to the second half of the thirteenth century, but no precise date can be indicated. It was organized, in different forms, in the Netherlands, in the south of France, in Germany, and in Italy. Probably some secular tertiaries, who in many cases had their house of meeting, gradually withdrew entirely from the world and so formed religious communities, but without the three substantial vows of religious orders. Other religious associations such as the Beguines (women) and Beghards (men) in the Low Countries, sometimes became Third Orders.\n\nThroughout the fourteenth century, the regular tertiaries of both sexes had in the most cases no common organization; only in the following century we can observe single well-ordered religious communities with solemn vows and a common head. Pope Martin V submitted in 1428 all tertiaries, regular and secular, to the direction of the Minister-General of the Friars Minor (Bull. Franc., VII, 715), but this disposition was soon revoked by his successor Pope Eugene IV. We meet thus in the same fifteenth century with numerous independent male congregations of regular tertiaries with the three vows in Italy, Sicily, Dalmatia, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, and in the Netherlands. Contemporaneously there existed sister congregations of the Third Order with solemn vows, for instance, the Grey sisters of the Third Order, serving in hospitals, spread in France and the Netherlands. Leo X, to introduce uniformity into the numerous congregations, gave in 1521 a new form to the rule, now in ten chapters, retaining of the rule as published by Nicholas IV all that could serve the purpose, adding new points, especially the three solemn vows, and insisting on subjection to the First Order of St. Francis. For this last disposition the Rule of Leo X met with resistance, and never was accepted by some congregations, whilst it serves till the present day as the basis of the constitutions of many later congregations, especially of numerous communities of sisters.\n\nThe two Italian congregations, the Lombardic and Sicilian, which had constituted themselves in the course of the fifteenth century, were united by Pope Paul III, and since Sixtus V enjoyed entire independence from the First Order. It had then already 11 provinces.\n\nThe dress is that of the Conventuals, from whom they can hardly be distinguished. The residence of the minister-general is at Rome, near the Church of Sts. Cosmas and Damian. After the time of Pope Leo X, the Spanish congregation often had troubles on the question of its submission to the First Order. After Pius V (1568) had put the whole Third Order again under the care of the Minister-General of the Friars Minor, the superiors of the three provinces constituted in Spain could, after 1625, partake at the General Chapters of the Friars Minor and since 1670 they have had even a definitor-general to represent them.\n\nWhilst Leo X in the reform of the rule had left it free to the congregations to adopt papal enclosure or not, Pius V (1568) prescribed it to all convents of tertiary sisters with solemn vows. Still this order was not carried out everywhere. In this regard the custom prevailed that the Friars Minor refused to take the direction of those convents which had only episcopal enclosure. Besides those already mentioned above, we may add the different offshoots of the Sisters of St. Elizabeth in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and France (there, under the name of Soeurs du Refuge, some of them still exist). The first Ursulines, also, founded by St. Angela Merici (1540), belonged to the Third Order.\n\nIn the nineteenth century many of the new congregations adopted the Rule of the Third Order, but most of them have no further connection with the First Order. Many of them have widely varying names; a good many are of mere local character, others again are of international importance. As to their activities, almost all dedicate themselves to works of charity, either in hospitals, homes, or ateliers; others work in schools, not a few are in foreign missions. We can give here scarcely more than a list of the names, with the dates of the foundation.\n\nThis was one of the earliest developments of Saint Dominic's \"Ordo de Poenitentia\". It was not indeed the primal organism from which the Friars Preachers evolved, but rather represents that portion of the Order of Penance which came under Dominican influence. At first vaguely constituted and living without system or form, its members gradually grew more and more dependent on their spiritual guides. Their two greatest saints are Catherine of Siena and Rose of Lima, who both lived ascetic lives in their family homes, and whose spiritual influence was great in their societies.\n\nThe Servite Order has had both a secular and regular Third Order. The secular Third Order was established in the United States in 1893.\n\nThe Sisters of the Third Order of Servites was founded by St. Juliana Falconieri of Florence, who received the habit ca. 1385 from Philip Benizi, then Prior General of the Servite friars. The Servite Sisters' traditional habit consisted of a black tunic, secured by a leather belt, and a white veil. The sisters devoted themselves especially to the care of the sick and other works of mercy; because the gown had short sleeves to facilitate work, people called the Sisters of the new order \"Mantellate.\" There were, in the early 20th century, two congregations, with a membership of 400.\n\nThese are the men and women who follow the spirit of the Rule of St. Augustine in their daily lives under the spiritual guidance of the Augustinian friars.\n\nThe Secular Augustinian Recollects () is the official Third Order of the Order of Augustinian Recollects. Today, the SAR is present in 19 countries in 111 Local Chapters with at least 3,500 members.\n\nThe Third Order, Society of St. Francis (TSSF), was founded in 1950. The TSSF consists of men and women, lay and ordained, married and single. It is divided into five provinces: Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the Americas. In addition the Franciscan Order of Divine Compassion, was founded in 1981. The FODC's Third Order, also known as the Brothers and Sisters of Penance, is composed of men and women, single and married, clerical and lay, who live in the world, working in their various life callings.\n\nThe Order of Saint Dominic within the Anglican Communion is known as the Anglican Order of Preachers (Dominican), and holds to a third order-style structure for all of its members. Its members, who follow the Dominican Rule, and are a designated 'Christian Community' (secular religious order), may be male or female, and it includes both single and married members. It is the primary manifestation of the Order of Saint Dominic within Anglicanism, which has no primary religious orders in the Dominican tradition.\n\nThe Order of Saint Andrew is an Anglican ecumenical religious order of both men and women, single and married, living and working in the world. Any member in good standing of any Christian Church in apostolic succession may make application to join.\n\nFranciscan Order of Divine Compassion, was founded in 1981. The FODC's Third Order, also known as the Brothers and Sisters of Penance, is composed of men and women, single and married, clerical and lay, who live in the world, working in their various life callings.\n\nThere are in the Lutheran Church, Lutheran Franciscan Third Orders in Germany, Sweden and North America.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is known for its faux-patina steel dome painted to imitate copper cladding. Nine nude muses, the \"nine maidens\" supporting the cornice line can be seen. The terracotta for this building, including the ladies, was made in Tamworth, Staffordshire, England by Gibbs and Canning Limited.\n\nThe Sun Tower was commissioned by L. D. Taylor to house his newspaper, \"The Vancouver World\". The intention was that the building would be visible throughout the \"World's\" circulation area as the tallest building in the city. \"John Coughland and Sons\" of Vancouver had 1,250 tons of steel fabricated for construction.\n\nWhen it was completed in 1912, it was called the World Building and was the tallest building in Vancouver at , surpassing the previous record-holder, the Dominion Building located just around the corner. For one year, it was the tallest building in the Canada, until Toronto's 85 metre Canadian Pacific Building opened in 1913. In 1918, droves of Vancouverites turned out to watch as Harry Gardiner, the \"Human Fly\", scaled the outside of the building. When \"The Vancouver Sun\" bought the building in 1937, it was renamed. Although \"The Sun\" newspaper has long since relocated, first to South Granville then to Granville Square, the building has retained the name.\n\nThe exterior of the Sun Tower is used as the Watchtower in \"Smallville\". The tower has been digitally enhanced to look taller. In certain shots, the tower is the highest building in Metropolis.\n\nFormerly 100 West Pender St, the City of Vancouver renumbered the street address of the Sun Tower to 128 West Pender in 2011 in accordance with its strict street numbering bylaw when a new building was constructed on the vacant lot at the south west corner of West Pender and Abbott Streets.\n\nThe Sun Tower was designed by architect William Tuff Whiteway, who also designed the original Woodward's building nearby. The building takes the form of an eight-storey, L-shaped block, surmounted by a nine-storey hexagonal-section tower. The tower is capped by a Beaux-Arts dome and cupola. The structure of the tower is steel, which is dominantly clad in a combination of terracotta tiles and rusticated brickwork. The dome itself, although painted to resemble patinated copper, is steel.\n\nThe exterior is adorned with nine terracotta caryatids supporting the cornice, sculpted by Charles Marega. These apparently caused a minor scandal among some of Vancouver's citizenry at the building's opening, as the female figures are depicted partially clothed, with naked breasts, and were considered to be adopting \"sensuous\" poses. Further decorative detailing is provided by carved stone sills under all windows, manufactured from local volcanic andesite from Haddington Island. Haddington Island andesite is also used for some of the decorative carvings near the top of the tower, that feature animal skulls surrounded by garlands of fruit and flowers.\n\n\nIt was announced on March 19, 2008 that the Sun Tower had been sold to new owners on March 17.

It is an association of lay people who choose to live the Gospel in the spirit of the Carmelite Order and under its guidance. The Carmelites known for devotion to Blessed Virgin Mary under her title as Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\n\nSoon after the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was established in Europe in the thirteenth century, lay persons, not bound by religious vows, seem to have attached themselves to it more or less closely. There is evidence of the existence of a \"Confrairie Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel\" at Toulouse in 1273, and of a \"Compagnia di Santa Maria del Carmino\" at Bologna in 1280, but the exact nature of these bodies is uncertain owing to a lack of documents. \n\nSomewhat later mention is frequently made of trade-guilds having their seat in churches of the order, members of which acted as their chaplains. Thus the master-bakers, innkeepers and pastry-cooks at Nîmes, the barbers and surgeons of the same town, who were also connected with the Dominicans, the goldsmiths at Avignon. Benefactors of the order received letters of fraternity with the right of participation in the privileges and good works of the friars. Others, under the name of \"bizzoche\" and \"mantellatoe\", wore the habit and observed the rule, at Florence in 1308. Still others became recluses in the anchorages attached to Carmelite churches. Among the tertiaries not living in community were Blessed Louis Morbioli of Bologna (d. 1495). \n\nThe canonical institution of the third order dates from the middle of the fifteenth century, when a community of Beguines at Guelders sought affiliation to the order, and Blessed John Soreth, General of the Carmelites, obtained a Bull (7 October 1452) granting the superiors of his order the faculties enjoyed by the Hermits of Saint Augustine and the Dominicans of canonically establishing convents of \"virgins, widows, beguines and mantellatae\". Also Saint Nuno of Saint Mary had participated in the developing work of the carmelite third order. Further legislation took place in 1476 by the Bull \"Mare magnum privilegiorum\", and under Pope Benedict XIII and his successors.\n\nThe rule observed by the tertiaries, whether living in the world or gathered into communities, was originally that of the friars with modifications as required by their status. Theodor Stratius, General of the Carmelites of the Ancient Observance, composed in 1635 a new rule, revised in 1678, which is still observed among tertiaries of the Calced and the Discalced Carmelites. \n\nThere are numerous corporations of tertiaries established in different countries, viz. two communities of tertiary brothers in Ireland (Drumcondra and Clondalkin near Dublin) in charge of an asylum for the blind and of a high-school for boys; eighteen communities of native priests in British India belonging partly to the Latin and partly to the Syro-Malabar Churches; four houses of Brothers of Christian Education in Spain. \n\nIn Britain, the Third Order experienced a particular growth following the return of the Carmelite friars to Britain in the 1920s. There are around 500 professed members of the Carmelite Third Order Secular in Britain.\n\nFar more numerous are the communities of nuns, namely twenty-three in India (Latin and Syro-Malabar rites) for the education of native girls, and four convents in Syria in connection with the missions of the Order; two congregations of tertiaries in Spain with nineteen and forty-eight establishments respectively, and one unattached, for educational work. In Spain there are also tertiary nuns called \"Carmelitas de la caridad\" engaged in works of charity with 150 establishments. The Austrian congregation of nuns numbers twenty-seven houses, while the most recent branch, the Carmelite Tertiaries of the Sacred Heart, founded at Berlin towards the end of the last century for the care and education of orphans and neglected children, have spread rapidly through Germany, Holland, England, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, and Hungary, and have twenty houses. In Italy there are three different congregations with thirty-two convents. There are smaller branches of the tertiaries in South America with two houses at Santiago, Chile, in Switzerland with four convents, and in England with one. \n\nThose who wish to be members of the Carmelite Third Order must be practicing Catholics. They must not be members of any other Third Order or Secular Institute, except in special cases, and they must be at least 18 years of age. After a period of initial formation, candidates are accepted for profession. The term 'Lay Carmel' is somewhat problematic when describing the Secular/Third Orders because there are a number of ordained ministers (deacons, priests and bishops) who, while not lay people, are professed members of the Secular/Third Orders.\n\nApart from attending a monthly community meeting, Lay Carmelites wear the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel as an external sign of dedication to Mary, and of trust in her protection. They are expected to participate in the daily celebration of the Eucharist when possible, and should spend about one half-hour in meditation each day, reflecting on the Scriptures, Lectio Divina, or some other appropriate type of personal reflective prayer. The Lay Carmelite also prays the Liturgy of the Hours – Morning and Evening Prayer.\n\nThe charism of Lay Carmelites is prayer, community, and ministry.\n\nTwenty-six countries were represented at the 2006 International Congress of Lay Carmelites.\n\nAs of 2012, the Ontario and Northwestern New York Region of the Carmelite Province of the Most Pure Heart of Mary (PCM) had eleven communities with 194 active members.\n\n\n"}

At the end of the 2004–2005 school year, approximately 370 students were enrolled. The school now has a steady enrollment of about 480 students. James Bushman, Ed.D., has been Head of School since 2006. University High School is chartered by Fresno Unified School District and has special autonomy over its administration.\n\nProspective students must apply to UHS with at least intermediate-level proficiency in instrumental or vocal music. The school accepts approximately 130 new freshmen per year by lottery from its pool of applicants. It is possible to transfer to the school as a junior, but this requires taking the first-year Latin and musicianship courses in summer school or acquiring some exemptions from the administration.\n\nThe UHS curriculum offers students a college-prep course of study. In addition to typical high school courses in math, science, English, social sciences, and PE, students are also required to study two years of Latin and four years of musicianship, which entails musicology, music theory, audiation, and musical analysis. Students are required to participate in music performance classes every semester, either playing an instrument or participating in choir. Because of its location on the CSUF campus, students are required to take selected university courses for dual credit beginning in the sophomore year. These include world history, science, and foreign language. Elective courses may include selected university classes, along with an array of short courses in subjects such as the arts, sciences, theater, literature, culture, competitive teams, athletics, and community service.\n\nAcademic teams include Academic Decathlon, Science Olympiad, Mock Trial, and Speech and Debate.

In October 2009, construction began on a brand new facility for University High School, designed to replace the complex of portables that had held students for the previous nine years. The new building, which opened in November 2010, contains 11 new classrooms, four science labs, three music rooms, and a Mac-based computer lab. The building is split into three wings: the leftmost administration wing, the center classroom wing, and the rightmost music wing. Every classroom is fitted with state-of-the-art tools to enhance the learning process such as interactive whiteboards and Steelcase desk chairs that offer reclination. All of the music rooms are acoustically engineered for the types of ensembles performing in them.

{"id": "2065098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065098", "title": "Severn Estuary", "text": "Severn Estuary\n\nThe Severn Estuary () is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is the confluence of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range, approximately , means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy.\n\nDefinitions of the limits of the Severn Estuary vary. A narrower definition adopted by some maps is that the river becomes the Severn Estuary after the Second Severn Crossing near Severn Beach, South Gloucestershire, and stretches to a line from Lavernock Point (south of Cardiff) to Sand Point near Weston-super-Mare. The definition used on Admiralty Chart SC1179 and the Bristol Channel and Severn Cruising Guide is that the estuary extends upstream to Aust, the site of the old Severn Bridge. The estuary is about wide at Aust, and about wide between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare.\n\nThe Estuary forms the boundary between Wales and England in this stretch. On the northern side of the estuary are the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels which are on either side of the city of Newport; and, to the west, the city of Cardiff together with the resort of Penarth. On the southern, English, side, are Avonmouth, Portishead, Clevedon, and Weston-super-Mare. Denny Island is a small rocky island of , with scrub vegetation, approximately three miles north of Portishead. Its rocky southern foreshore marks the boundary between England and Wales, but the island itself is reckoned administratively to Monmouthshire, Wales.\n\nThe estuary has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world — about .\nThe estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range and the underlying geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown coloration.\n\nWest of the line between Lavernock Point and Sand Point is the Bristol Channel, which in turn discharges into the Celtic Sea and the wider Atlantic Ocean. The islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm are located close to that line, in the middle of the estuary.\n\nSometimes the term \"Severn Estuary\" is used to include the tidal upstream stretch between Gloucester and Aust. During the highest tides on the upper reaches of this stretch, the rising water is funnelled up the estuary into the Severn bore, a self-reinforcing solitary wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current.\n\nThe tidal range results in the estuary having one of the most extensive intertidal wildlife habitats in the UK, comprising mudflats, sandflats, rocky platforms and islands. These form a basis for plant and animal communities typical of extreme physical conditions of liquid mud and tide-swept sand and rock. The estuary is recognised as a wetland area of international importance and is designated as a Ramsar site. The estuary is recognised as a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the EC Directive on the conservation of Wild Birds. The estuary is recognised as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the EU Habitats Directive.\n\nParts of the estuary have also been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The SSSI includes most of the foreshore upstream from Cardiff and Brean Down and most of the upper estuary as far as Sharpness. The Upper Severn Estuary SSSI covers the tidal river between Purton and Frampton on Severn.\n\nThe Severn Estuary SSSI original designation involves the then counties of Somerset, Avon and Gloucestershire in England, and Gwent and South Glamorgan in Wales. The Severn Estuary SSSI designation overlaps individual site designations for separate sites in Avon (Spring Cove Cliffs, Middle Hope, Portishead Pier to Black Nore, Aust Cliff), Gloucestershire (Purton Passage) and South Glamorgan (Penarth Coast). The 1976 designation includes two sites previously notified in 1952 (Brean Down and Uphill Cliff). The SSSI forms the major part of a larger area which includes the Taf/Ely Estuary and Bridgwater Bay (as well as the Upper Severn Estuary)\n\nThe Upper Severn Estuary SSSI designation involves the English county of Gloucestershire. The site (Severn Estuary and Upper Severn Estuary) is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).\n\nBoth SSSI citations provide detail of the geological and biological interest and of particular note is the international importance for wintering and wading birds of passage, and of estuarine habits of outstanding ornithological significance. It is stated that the estuary supports over 10% of the British wintering population and is the single most important wintering ground for dunlin, and for significant numbers of Bewick's swans, European white-fronted geese and wigeon. Nationally important wintering populations are supported such as gadwall, shoveller and pochard.\n\nThere are notably seven species of migratory fish which pass through the estuary in both directions. These include significant numbers of Atlantic salmon and common eel.\n\nA huge tidal range and high level of surrounding industry and population have long made the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel a focus for tidal energy schemes and ideas. Plans for a Severn Barrage — running across the Bristol Channel from Lavernock Point near to and south west of Cardiff to Brean Down near and just south west of Weston-super-Mare in Somerset — would generate a massive 8640 MW when the tide flows, and have been discussed for several decades now. The power generated would come from a lake of with a potential energy depth of . Tidal power only runs for around ten hours a day, but by using the enclosed lake as a reservoir of potential energy more hours of operation could be achieved. Other energy sources, such as wind and solar power, also create electricity at times that do not always match when it is needed. Excess power could be stored by pumping water uphill, as is already done at a variety of other installations in the UK.\n\nThe UK Government shelved the plans in the late 1980s due largely to cost issues and local environmental concerns. However, this was before recent huge rises in the price of energy, and before global warming had started to be taken seriously. In April 2006 the Welsh Assembly approved the idea of utilising the tidal power, but the RSPB has raised serious concerns about the effect on the mud flats, that have European Environmental protection status, and the UK government Energy Review published later in the year did not endorse the scheme.\n\nOpinion is still divided on the benefits of a proposed barrage. John Hutton, Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, announced a further feasibility study on 25 September 2007. The Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study was launched in January 2008 to assess all tidal range technologies (including barrages, lagoons and others). The study will look at the costs, benefits and impacts of a Severn tidal power scheme and will help Government decide whether it could or could not support such a scheme.\n\nThe Severn Estuary has the potential to generate more renewable electricity than all other UK estuaries. If harnessed, it could create up to 5% of the UK's electricity, contributing significantly to UK climate change goals as well as European Union renewable energy targets. The proposal for a hydro-electric barrier to generate 8.6 GW and meet five percent of Britain's power needs, is being opposed by some environmental groups.\n\nThe Severn Estuary Partnership (SEP) was set up in 1995 as an independent initiative to focus the activities of local government, statutory authorities and interested parties such as farmers and fisherman. Its stated aim is \"To bring together all those involved in the development, management and use of the Estuary within a framework which encourages the integration of their interests and responsibilities to achieve common objectives\".\nIn 2001 SEP published the \"Strategy for the Severn Estuary\", which sets out a plan for the management of the estuary.\n\nSEP uses a geographically extended definition of the Severn Estuary, beginning at the tidal limit of the River Severn in Gloucester and ending at a line drawn between Hurlestone Point near Minehead and Nash Point in the Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nThe archaeology of the Severn Estuary is richly varied and of considerable importance, reflecting both the varied nature of the topography and the importance of the river for both fishing and as a maritime waterway. The archaeological resource within the estuary is under threat from natural processes such as coastal erosion, exacerbated by the high tidal range and strong tidal currents, and from threats such as ongoing development pressure along the shoreline, marine aggregates extraction and new coastal defensive and realignment measures as well as proposed major infrastructure projects. An archaeological aerial survey report of the archaeology on the English side is available to view and download from the reference link.\n\n"}
{"id": "2065100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065100", "title": "Axon guidance", "text": "Axon guidance\n\nAxon guidance (also called axon pathfinding) is a subfield of neural development concerning the process by which neurons send out axons to reach their correct targets. Axons often follow very precise paths in the nervous system, and how they manage to find their way so accurately is an area of ongoing research. \n\nAxon growth takes place from a region called the growth cone and reaching the axon target is accomplished with relatively few guidance molecules. Growth cone receptors respond to the guidance cues.\n\nGrowing axons have a highly motile structure at the growing tip called the growth cone, which \"sniffs out\" the extracellular activities in the environment for signals that instruct the axon which direction to grow. These signals, called guidance cues, can be fixed in place or diffusible; they can attract or repel axons. Growth cones contain receptors that recognize these guidance cues and interpret the signal into a chemotropic response. The general theoretical framework is that when a growth cone \"senses\" a guidance cue, the receptors activate various signaling molecules in the growth cone that eventually affect the cytoskeleton. If the growth cone senses a gradient of guidance cue, the intracellular signaling in the growth cone happens asymmetrically, so that cytoskeletal changes happen asymmetrically and the growth cone turns toward or away from the guidance cue.\n\nA combination of genetic and biochemical methods (see below) has led to the discovery of several important classes of axon guidance molecules and their receptors:\n\nIn addition, many other classes of extracellular molecules are used by growth cones to navigate properly:\n\nGrowing axons rely on a variety of guidance cues in deciding upon a growth pathway. The growth cones of extending axons process these cues in an intricate system of signal interpretation and integration, in order to ensure appropriate guidance. These cues can be functionally subdivided into:\nGiven the abundance of these different guidance cues it was previously believed that growth cones integrate various information by simply summing the gradient of cues, in different valences, at a given point in time, to making a decision on the direction of growth. However, studies in vertebrate nervous systems of ventral midline crossing axons, has shown that modulatory cues play a crucial part in tuning axon responses to other cues, suggesting that the process of axon guidance is nonlinear. For example, commissural axons are attracted by Netrin and repelled by Slit. However, as axons approach the midline, the repellent action of Slit is suppressed by Robo-3/Rig-1 receptor. Once the axons cross the midline, activation of Robo by Slit silences Netrin-mediated attraction, and the axons are repelled by Slit.\n\nThe formation of a nerve tract follows several basic rules. In both invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems initial nerve tracts are formed by the pioneer axons of pioneer neurons. These axons follow a reproducible pathway, stop at intermediate targets, and branch axons at certain choice points, in the process of targeting their final destination. This principle is illustrated by CNS extending axons of sensory neurons in insects.\n\nDuring the process of limb development, proximal neurons are the first to form axonal bundles while growing towards the CNS. In later stages of limb growth, axons from more distal neurons fasciculate with these pioneer axons. Deletion of pioneer neurons disrupts the extension of later axons, destined to innervate the CNS. At the same time, it is worth noting that in most cases pioneer neurons do not contain unique characteristics and their role in axon guidance can be substituted by other neurons. For instance, in Xenopus retinotectal connection systems, the pioneer axons of retinal ganglion cells originate from the dorsal part of the eye. However, if the dorsal half of the eye is replaced by less mature dorsal part, ventral neurons can replace the pioneer pathway of the dorsal cells, after some delay. Studies in zebrafish retina showed that inhibiting neural differentiation of early retinal progenitors prevents axons from exiting the eye. The same study demonstrated aberrant growth trajectories in secondary neurons, following the growth of pioneer neurons missing a guidance receptor. Thus, while the extent of guidance provided by pioneer axons is under debate and may vary from system to system, the pioneer pathways clearly provide the follower projections with guidance cues and enhance their ability to navigate to target.\n\nThe first extending axons in a pathway interact closely with immature glia cells. In the forming corpus callosum of vertebrates, primitive glia cells first migrate to the ependymal zones of hemispheres and the dorsal septum wall to form a transient structure that the pioneer axons of the callosal fibers use to extend. The signaling between glia and neurons in the developing nervous system is reciprocal. For instance, in the fly visual system, axons of photoreceptors require glia to exit the eye stalk whereas glia cells rely on signals from neurons to migrate back along axons.\n\nThe growing axons also rely on transient neuronal structures such as guidepost cells, during pathfinding. In the mouse visual system, proper optic chiasm formation depends on a V-shaped structure of transient neurons that intersect with specialized radial glia at the midline of the chiasm. The chiasm axons grow along and around this structure but do not invade it. Another example is the subplate in the developing cerebral cortex that consists of transient neuronal layer under the subventricular zone and serves as a guidepost for axons entering permanent cortical layers. The subplate is similar to the chiasmatic neurons in that these cell groups disappear (or transit into other cell types) as the brain matures. These findings indicate that transitory cell populations can serve an important guidance role even though they have no function in the mature nervous system.\n\nThe earliest descriptions of the axonal growth cone were made by the Spanish neurobiologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century. However, understanding the molecular and cellular biology of axon guidance would not begin until decades later. In the last thirty years or so, scientists have used various methods to work out how axons find their way. Much of the early work in axon guidance was done in the grasshopper, where individual motor neurons were identified and their pathways characterized. In genetic model organisms like mice, zebrafish, nematodes, and fruit flies, scientists can generate mutations and see whether and how they cause axons to make errors in navigation. In vitro experiments can be useful for direct manipulation of growing axons. A popular method is to grow neurons in culture and expose growth cones to purified guidance cues to see whether these cause the growing axons to turn. These types of experiments have often been done using traditional embryological non-genetic model organisms, such as the chicken and African clawed frog. Embryos of these species are easy to obtain and, unlike mammals, develop externally and are easily accessible to experimental manipulation.\n\nSeveral types of axon pathways have been extensively studied in model systems to further understand the mechanisms of axon guidance. Perhaps the two most prominent of these are commissures and topographic maps. Commissures are sites where axons cross the midline from one side of the nervous system to the other. Topographic maps are systems in which groups of neurons in one tissue project their axons to another tissue in an organized arrangement such that spatial relationships are maintained; i.e. adjacent neurons will innervate adjacent regions of the target tissue.\n\nAs described above, axonal guidance cues are often categorized as \"attractive\" or \"repulsive.\" This is a simplification, as different axons will respond to a given cue differently. Furthermore, the same axonal growth cone can alter its responses to a given cue based on timing, previous experience with the same or other cues, and the context in which the cue is found. These issues are exemplified during the development of commissures. The bilateral symmetry of the nervous system means that axons will encounter the same cues on either side of the midline. Before crossing (ipsilaterally), the growth cone must navigate toward and be attracted to the midline. However, after crossing (contralaterally), the same growth cone must become repelled or lose attraction to the midline and reinterpret the environment to locate the correct target tissue.\n\nTwo experimental systems have had particularly strong impacts on understanding how midline axon guidance is regulated:\n\nThe use of powerful genetic tools in \"Drosophila\" led to the identification of a key class of axon guidance cues, the Slits, and their receptors, the Robos (short for Roundabout). The ventral nerve cord looks like a ladder, with three longitudinal axon bundles (fascicles) connected by the commissures, the \"rungs\" of the ladder. There are two commissures, anterior and posterior, within each segment of the embryo.\n\nThe currently accepted model is that Slit, produced by midline cells, repels axons from the midline via Robo receptors. Ipsilaterally projecting (non-crossing) axons always have Robo receptors on their surface, while commissural axons have very little or no Robo on their surface, allowing them to be attracted to the midline by Netrins and, probably, other as-yet unidentified cues. After crossing, however, Robo receptors are strongly upregulated on the axon, which allows Robo-mediated repulsion to overcome attraction to the midline. This dynamic regulation of Robo is at least in part accomplished by a molecule called Comm (short for Commissureless), which prevents Robo from reaching the cell surface and targeting it for destruction.\n\nIn the spinal cord of vertebrates, commissural neurons from the dorsal regions project downward toward the ventral floor plate. Ipsilateral axons turn before reaching the floor plate to grow longitudinally, while commissural axons cross the midline and make their longitudinal turn on the contralateral side. Strikingly, Netrins, Slits, and Robos all play similar functional roles in this system as well. One outstanding mystery was the apparent lack of any \"comm\" gene in vertebrates. It now seems that at least some of Comm's functions are performed by a modified form of Robo called Robo3 (or Rig1).\n\nThe spinal cord system was the first to demonstrate explicitly the altered responsiveness of growth cones to cues after exposure to the midline. Explanted neurons grown in culture would respond to exogenously supplied Slit according to whether or not they had contacted floor plate tissue.\n\nAs described above, topographic maps occur when spatial relationships are maintained between neuronal populations and their target fields in another tissue. This is a major feature of nervous system organization, particular in sensory systems. The neurobiologist Roger Sperry proposed a prescient model for topographic mapping mediated by what he called molecular \"tags.\" The relative amounts of these tags would vary in gradients across both tissues. We now think of these tags as ligands (cues) and their axonal receptors. Perhaps the best understood class of tags are the Ephrin ligands and their receptors, the Ephs.\n\nIn the simplest type of mapping model, we could imagine a gradient of Eph receptor expression level in a field of neurons, such as the retina, with the anterior cells expressing very low levels and cells in the posterior expressing the highest levels of the receptor. Meanwhile, in the target of the retinal cells (the optic tectum), Ephrin ligands are organized in a similar gradient: high posterior to low anterior. Retinal axons enter the anterior tectum and proceed posteriorly. Because, in general, Eph-bearing axons are repelled by Ephrins, axons will become more and more reluctant to proceed the further they advance toward the posterior tectum. However, the degree to which they are repelled is set by their own particular level of Eph expression, which is set by the position of the neuronal cell body in the retina. Thus, axons from the anterior retina, expressing the lowest level of Ephs, can project to the posterior tectum, even though this is where Ephrins are highly expressed. Posterior retinal cells express high Eph level, and their axons will stop more anteriorly in the tectum.\n\nThe large size and accessibility of the chicken embryo has made it a favorite model organism for embryologists. Researchers used the chick to biochemically purify components from the tectum that showed specific activity against retinal axons in culture. This led to the identification of Ephs and Ephrins as Sperry's hypothesized \"tags.\"\n\nThe retinotectal projection has also been studied in \"Xenopus\" and zebrafish. Zebrafish is a potentially powerful system because genetic screens like those performed in invertebrates can be done relatively simply and cheaply. In 1996, large scale screens were conducted in zebrafish, including screens for retinal axon guidance and mapping. Many of the mutants have yet to be characterized.\n\nGenetics and biochemistry have identified a large set of molecules that affect axon guidance. How all of these pieces fit together is less understood. Most axon guidance receptors activate signal transduction cascades that ultimately lead to reorganization of the cytoskeleton and adhesive properties of the growth cone, which together underlie the motility of all cells. This has been well documented in mammalian cortical neurons. However, this raises the question of how the same cues can result in a spectrum of response from different growth cones. It may be that different receptors activate attraction or repulsion in response to a single cue. Another possibility is the receptor complexes act as \"coincidence detectors\" to modify responses to one cue in the presence of another. Similar signaling \"cross-talk\" could occur intracellularly, downstream of receptors on the cell surface.\n\nIn fact, commissural axon growth responses have been shown to be attracted, repressed, or silenced in the presence of Netrin activated DCC receptor. This variable activity is dependent on Robo or UNC-5 receptor expression at growth cones. Such that Slit activated Robo receptor, causes a silencing of Netrin’s attractive potential through the DCC receptor. While growth cones expressing UNC-5 receptor, respond in a repulsive manner to Netrin-DCC activation. These events occur as consequence of cytoplasmic interactions between the Netrin activated DCC receptor and Robo or UNC-5 receptor, which ultimately alters DCC’s cytoplasmic signaling. Thus, the picture that emerges is that growth cone advancement is highly complex and subject to plasticity from guidance cues, receptor expression, receptor interactions, and the subsequent signaling mechanisms that influence cytoskeleton remodeling.\n\nThe ability for axons to navigate and adjust responses to various extracellular cues, at long distances from the cell body, has prompted investigators to look at the intrinsic properties of growth cones. Recent studies reveal that guidance cues can influence spatiotemporal changes in axons by modulating the local translation and degradation of proteins in growth cones. Furthermore, this activity seems to occur independent of distal nuclear gene expression. In fact, in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with soma severed axons, growth cones continue to track and innervate the tectum of Xenopus embryos.\n\nTo accommodate this activity, growth cones are believed to pool mRNAs that code for receptors and intracellular signaling proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling. In Xenopus retinotectal projection systems, the expression of these proteins has been shown to be influenced by guidance cues and the subsequent activation of local translation machinery. The attractive cue Netrin-1, stimulates mRNA transport and influence synthesis of β-Actin in filopodia of growth cones, to restructure and steer RGC growth cones in the direction of Netrin secretion. While the repulsive cue, Slit, is suggested to stimulate the translation of Cofilin (an actin depolymerizing factor) in growth cones, leading to axon repulsion. In addition, severed commissural axons in chicks, display the capability of translating and expressing Eph-A2 receptor during midline crossing. As a result, studies suggest that local protein expression is a convenient mechanism to explain the rapid, dynamic, and autonomous nature of growth cone advancement in response to guidance molecules.\n\nContemporary diffusion-weighted MRI techniques may also uncover the macroscopical process of axonal development. The connectome, or the braingraph, can be constructed from diffusion MRI data: the vertices of the graph correspond to anatomically labelled brain areas, and two such vertices, say \"u\" and \"v\", are connected by an edge if the tractography phase of the data processing finds an axonal fiber that connects the two areas, corresponding to \"u\" and \"v\". Numerous braingraphs, computed from the Human Connectome Project can be downloaded from the http://braingraph.org site. The Consensus Connectome Dynamics (CCD) is a remarkable phenomenon that was discovered by continuously decreasing the minimum confidence-parameter at the graphical interface of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server. The Budapest Reference Connectome Server depicts the cerebral connections of n=418 subjects with a frequency-parameter k: For any k=1,2...,n one can view the graph of the edges that are present in at least k connectomes. If parameter k is decreased one-by-one from k=n through k=1 then more and more edges appear in the graph, since the inclusion condition is relaxed. The surprising observation is that the appearance of the edges is far from random: it resembles a growing, complex structure, like a tree or a shrub (visualized on .\nIt is hypothesized in that the growing structure copies the axonal development of the human brain: the earliest developing connections (axonal fibers) are common in most of the subjects, and the subsequently developing connections have larger and larger variance, because their variances are accumulated in the process of axonal development.\n\nAxon guidance is genetically associated with other characteristics or features. For example, enrichment analyses of different signaling pathways led to the discovery of a genetic association with intracranial volume.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2065110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065110", "title": "Ice algae", "text": "Ice algae\n\nIce algae are any of the various types of algal communities found in annual and multi-year sea or terrestrial ice. On sea ice in the polar oceans, ice algae communities play an important role in primary production. The timing of blooms of the algae is especially important for supporting higher trophic levels at times of the year when light is low and ice cover still exists. Sea ice algal communities are mostly concentrated in the bottom layer of the ice, but can also occur in brine channels within the ice, in melt ponds, and on the surface.\n\nBecause terrestrial ice algae occur in freshwater systems, the species composition differs greatly from that of sea ice algae. These communities are significant in that they often change the color of glaciers and ice sheets, impacting the reflectivity of the ice itself.\n\nMicrobial life in sea ice is extremely diverse, and includes abundant algae, bacteria and protozoa. Algae in particular dominate the sympagic environment, with estimates of more than 1000 unicellular eukaryotes found to associate with sea ice in the Arctic. Species composition and diversity vary based on location, ice type, and irradiance. In general, pennate diatoms such as \"Nitschia frigida\" (in the Arctic) and \"Fragilariopsis\" cylindrus (in the Antarctic) are abundant. \"Melosira arctica\", which forms up to meter-long filaments attached to the bottom of the ice, are also widespread in the Arctic and are an important food source for marine species.\n\nWhile sea ice algae communities are found throughout the column of sea ice, abundance and community composition depends on the time of year. There are many microhabitats available to algae on and within sea ice, and different algal groups have different preferences. For example, in late winter/early spring, motile diatoms like \"N. frigida\" have been found to dominate the uppermost layers of the ice, as far as briny channels reach, and their abundance is greater in multi-year ice (MYI) than in first year ice (FYI). Additionally, dinoflagellates have also been found to dominant in the early austral spring in Antarctic sea ice.\n\nSea ice algal communities can also thrive at the surface of the ice, in surface melt ponds, and in layers where rafting has occurred. In melt ponds, dominant algal types can vary with pond salinity, with higher concentrations of diatoms being found in melt ponds with higher salinity. Because of their adaption to low light conditions, the presence of ice algae (in particular, vertical position in the ice pack) is primarily limited by nutrient availability. The highest concentrations are found at the base of the ice because the porosity of that ice enables nutrient infiltration from seawater.\n\nTo survive in the harsh sea ice environment, organisms must be able to endure extreme variations in salinity, temperature, and solar radiation. Algae living in brine channels can secrete osmolytes, such as dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which allows them to survive the high salinities in the channels after ice formation in the winter, as well as low salinities when the relatively fresh meltwater flushes the channels in the spring and summer. Some sea ice algae species secrete ice-binding proteins (IBP) as a gelatinous extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) to protect cell membranes from damage from ice crystal growth and freeze thaw cycles. EPS alters the microstructure of the ice and creates further habitat for future blooms. Surface-dwelling algae produce special pigments to prevent damage from harsh ultraviolet radiation. Higher concentrations of xanthophyll pigments act as a sunscreen that protects ice algae from photodamage when they are exposed to damaging levels of ultraviolet radiation upon transition from ice to the water column during the spring. Algae under thick ice have been reported to show some of the most extreme low light adaptations ever observed. Extreme efficiency in light utilization allows sea ice algae to build up biomass rapidly when light conditions improve at the onset of spring.\n\nIce algae play a critical role in primary production and serve as part of the base of the polar food web by converting carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients to oxygen and organic matter through photosynthesis in the upper ocean of both the Arctic and Antarctic. Within the Arctic, estimates of the contribution of sea ice algae to total primary production ranges from 3-25%, up to 50-57% in high Arctic regions. Sea ice algae accumulate biomass rapidly, often at the base of sea ice, and grow to form algal mats that are consumed by amphipods such as krill and copepods. Ultimately, these organisms are eaten by fish, whales, penguins, and dolphins. When sea ice algal communities detach from the sea ice they are consumed by pelagic grazers, such as zooplankton, as they sink through the water column and by benthic invertebrates as they settle on the seafloor. Sea ice algae as food are rich in polyunsaturated and other essential fatty acids, and are the exclusive producer of certain essential omega-3 fatty acids that are important for copepod egg production, egg hatching, and zooplankton growth and function. \n\nThe timing of sea ice algae blooms has a significant impact on the entire ecosystem. Initiation of the bloom is primarily controlled by the return of the sun in the spring (i.e. the solar angle). Because of this, ice algae blooms usually occurs before the blooms of pelagic phytoplankton, which require higher light levels and warmer water. Early in the season, prior to the ice melt, sea ice algae constitute an important food source for higher trophic levels. However, the total percentage that sea ice algae contribute to the primary production of a given ecosystem depends strongly on the extent of ice cover. The thickness of snow on the sea ice also affects the timing and size of the ice algae bloom by altering light transmission. This sensitivity to ice and snow cover has the potential to cause a mismatch between predators and their food-source, sea ice algae, within the ecosystem. This so called match/mismatch has been applied to a variety of systems. Examples have been seen in the relationship between zooplankton species, which rely on sea ice algae and phytoplankton for food, and juvenile walleye pollock in the Bering Sea.\n\nThere are several ways in which sea ice algal blooms are thought to start their annual cycle, and hypotheses about these vary depending on water column depth, sea ice age, and taxonomic group. Where sea ice overlays deep ocean, it is proposed that cells trapped in multiyear ice brine pockets are reconnected to the water column below and quickly colonize nearby ice of all ages. This is known as the \"multiyear sea ice repository hypothesis\". This seeding source has been demonstrated in diatoms, which dominate sympagic blooms. Other groups, such as the dinoflagellates, which also bloom in the spring/summer, have been shown to maintain low cell numbers in the water column itself, and do not primarily overwinter within the ice. Where sea ice covers ocean that is somewhat shallower, resuspension of cells from the sediment may occur.\n\nClimate change and warming of Arctic and Antarctic regions have the potential to greatly alter ecosystem functioning. Decreasing ice cover in polar regions is expected to lessen the relative proportion of sea ice algae production to measures of annual primary production. Thinning ice allows for greater production early in the season but early ice melting shortens the overall growing season of the sea ice algae. This melting also contributes to stratification of the water column that alters the availability of nutrients for algae growth by decreasing the depth of the surface mixed layer and inhibiting the upwelling of nutrients from deep waters. This is expected to cause an overall shift towards pelagic phytoplankton production. Changes in multiyear ice volume will also have an impact on ecosystem function in terms of bloom seeding source adjustment. Reduction in MYI, a temporal refugia for diatoms in particular, will likely alter sympagic community composition, resulting in bloom initialization that derives from species that overwinter in the water column or sediments instead.\n\nBecause sea ice algae are often the base of the food web, these alterations have implications for species of higher trophic levels. The reproduction and migration cycles of many polar primary consumers are timed with the bloom of sea ice algae, meaning that a change in the timing or location of primary production could shift the distribution of prey populations necessary for significant keystone species. Production timing may also be altered by the melting through of surface melt ponds to the seawater below, which can alter sea ice algal habitat late in the growing season in such a way as to impact grazing communities as they approach winter.\n\nThe production of DMSP by sea ice algae also plays an important role in the carbon cycle. DMSP is oxidized by other plankton to dimethylsulfide (DMS), a compound which is linked to cloud formation. Because clouds impact precipitation and the amount of solar radiation reflected back to space (albedo), this process could create a positive feedback loop. Cloud cover would increase the insolation reflected back to space by the atmosphere, potentially helping to cool the planet and support more polar habitats for sea ice algae. As of 1987, research has suggested that a doubling of cloud-condensation nuclei, of which DMS is one type, would be required to counteract warming due to increased atmospheric CO concentrations.\n\nSea ice plays a major role in the global climate. Satellite observations of sea ice extent date back only until the late 1970s, and longer term observational records are sporadic and of uncertain reliability. While terrestrial ice paleoclimatology can be measured directly through ice cores, historical models of sea ice must rely on proxies.\n\nOrganisms dwelling on the sea ice eventually detach from the ice and fall through the water column, particularly when the sea ice melts. A portion of the material that reaches the seafloor is buried before it is consumed and is thus preserved in the sedimentary record.\n\nThere are a number of organisms whose value as proxies for the presence of sea ice has been investigated, including particular species of diatoms, dinoflagellate cysts, ostracods, and foraminifers. Variation in carbon and oxygen isotopes in a sediment core can also be used to make inferences about sea ice extent. Each proxy has advantages and disadvantages; for example, some diatom species that are unique to sea ice are very abundant in the sediment record, however, preservation efficiency can vary.\n\nAlgae also occur on terrestrial ice sheets and glaciers. The species found in these habitats are distinct from those associated with sea ice because the system is freshwater. Even within these habitats, there is a wide diversity of habitat types and algal assemblages. For example, cryosestic communities are specifically found on the surface of glaciers where the snow periodically melts during the day. Research has been done on glaciers and ice sheets across the world and several species have been identified. However, although there seems to be a wide array of species they have not been found is equal amounts. The most abundant species identified on different glaciers are \"Ancyonema nordenskioldii\" and C\"hlamydomonas nivalis\".\n\nThe rate of glacier melt depends on the surface albedo. Recent research has shown the growth of algae darkens local surface conditions, decreasing the albedo and thus increases the melt rate on these surfaces. Melting glaciers and ice sheets have been directly linked to increase in sea level rise. The second largest ice sheet is the Greenland Ice Sheet which has been retreating at alarming rates. Sea level rise will lead to an increase in both frequency and intensity of storm events.\n\nOn enduring ice sheets and snow pack, terrestrial ice algae often color the ice due to accessory pigments, popularly known as \"watermelon snow\". The dark pigments within the structure of algae increases sunlight absorption, leading to an increase in the melting rate. Algae blooms have been shown to appear on glaciers and ice sheets once the snow had begun to melt, which occurs when the air temperature is above the freezing point for a few days. The abundance of algae changes with the seasons and also spatially on glaciers. Their abundance is highest during the melting season of glaciers which occurs in the summer months. Climate change is affecting both the start of the melting season and also the length of this period, which will lead to an increase in the amount of algae growth.\n\nAs the ice/snow begins to melt the area the ice covers decreases which means a higher portion of land is exposed. The land underneath the ice has a higher rate of solar absorption due to it being less reflective and darker. Melting snow also has lower albedo than dry snow or ice because of its optical properties, so as snow begins to melt the albedo decreases, which results in more snow melting, and the loop continues. This feedback loop is referred to as the Ice–albedo feedback loop. This can have drastic effects on the amount of snow melting each season. Algae plays a role in this feedback loop by decreasing the level of albedo of the snow/ice. This growth of algae has been studied but its exact effects on decreasing albedo is still unknown.\n\nThe Black and Bloom project is conducting research to determine the amount algae are contributing to the darkening of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as well as algae's impact on the melting rates of the ice sheets. It is important to understand the extent to which algae is changing the albedo on glaciers and ice sheets. Once this is known, it should be incorporated into global climate models and then used to predict sea level rise.\n\n"}

A former road bicycle racing competitor, he is the brother of Olympic medalist in speed skating Jan Bos.\n\nBos was born in Hierden, Netherlands. He has an older brother Jan Bos, who is a professional speed skater.\n\nHe went to high school in Harderwijk, where he got a havo diploma. Later he also got a vwo diploma.\n\nIn 2001, he was Junior World Champion track cycling at 1,000 m. The same year, at the age of 18, he started his professional cycling career as a senior.\n\nHe won the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in the sprint event.\n\nHe won an individual gold in the sprint at the 2004 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. The following year, he won the individual sprint and a silver medal in the team sprint at the 2005 UCI Track Cycling World Championships.\n\nAt the 2006 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, Bos won the keirin and completed a career triple, having been world champion in the sprint, kilo and keirin. He won the keirin after accelerating with two laps to go, winning by a wide margin and able to raise his hands and salute the crowd as he passed the finish line. His French rival, and bronze medal winner, Arnaud Tournant, said Bos' performance was \"the best I've seen in a very long time.\"\n\nOn 16 December 2006, Bos broke the world 200m track record during qualification rounds for the sprint at a World Cup meeting in Moscow. Bos clocked 9.772 seconds (after a computer initially had given him an unlikely 9.086 seconds) and beat the 11-year record held by Canadian Curt Harnett. Bos declared the 200m the \"ultimate record\" for track cyclists. Five days later Bos was elected Dutch Sportsman of the year. Bos's record was beaten by Frenchman Kévin Sireau at the Moscow Grand Prix on 29 May 2009 with 9.65 seconds.\n\nStarting August 2017, Bos started riding for . He is in a team with Matthijs Büchli and Roy van den Berg. In 2017 Bos won the Dutch Championships in Team sprint with Matthijs Büchli and Roy van den Berg. At the 2018 World Championships in Apeldoorn he won a bronze medal in the individual 1 km time trial.\n\nOn 19 April 2009, Bos was in a controversial crash in the final 800m of the final stage of the Tour of Turkey. Bos caused the crash of the eventual winner Daryl Impey by grabbing Impey's left shoulder with his right hand. Impey crashed to the left, into the barrier, next to Bos. Bos admitted pushing Impey. Bos claimed the reason for pushing Impey was because Impey was moving in on him while he was already close to the fence. Bos was disqualified and fined. On 1 May 2009 the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) said \"Bos’s behavior undermined the image, reputation and interests of cycling\". Bos was charged with an infringement and was brought before a UCI disciplinary hearing in which he was found guilty of violating UCI regulations. Bos was subsequently suspended from professional racing from 15 August through 14 September 2009.\n\nIn the off season before 2010 Bos signed with the , that included former Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre. He was touted as another addition to their sprint team. He raced in many smaller races, and some large ones including Paris–Roubaix and the Vuelta a España. When the Cervelo Test Team folded in late 2010, Bos returned to the team, where he raced as a Continental. His first triumph of 2011 came in the first stage of the Tour of Oman, beating Mark Cavendish in a sprint finish.\n\nIn 2012, he won the first and last stages of the Tour of Turkey. Both of these stages saw crashes in the finale, diminishing the number of sprinters Bos had to compete against. Bos took the first win of his career at the World Tour level on the 2012 Eneco Tour. On Stage 3 from Riemst to Genk, he edged John Degenkolb () on the finish line in a bunch sprint to take the victory.\n\nBos was originally selected as a member of the Belkin squad for the 2013 Vuelta a España, however he was withdrawn before the start of the race after tests revealed he had low cortisol levels. A team statement noted that this was \"an indication of sub-optimal health conditions\", and that whilst low cortisol levels were not a barrier to competing in UCI World Tour races the team's medical staff and Bos had agreed to send him home. Subsequently, Bos confirmed that his condition was due to an extreme reaction to asthma medication.\n\nBos rode for the Pro Continental team from 2015 until 2016. Bos said about Team MTN-Qhubeka \"The team has a great culture, I want to win and we will work together to win, our success is the success of Africa.\"\n\nFollowing the Abu Dhabi Tour, where he did not finish stage 2, he has no results of any major road events since.\n\n"}

It was also the first NBA draft of the \"lottery\" era. It was also around this time where the league decreased the amount of rounds the draft spent, with the previous few years lasting up to 10 rounds total. A total of 162 players were selected over seven rounds by the league's 23 teams. The New York Knicks were awarded the first overall pick by winning the first-ever NBA draft lottery, which was held in May of that year. The Knicks ultimately used it on Georgetown's Patrick Ewing.

The lottery system used in 1985 involved a random drawing of seven envelopes from a hopper, with each of the then-seven non-playoff teams having an equal chance of obtaining the first pick. Inside each of the envelopes was the logo of a non-playoff team. The team whose envelope was drawn first would get the first pick. The process was then repeated until the rest of the first seven lottery picks were determined. In the U.S., CBS had live coverage of Stern pulling the envelopes from the hopper (as opposed to NBA Draft lotteries today where the actual drawing is held behind closed doors \"before\" the results are revealed on TV). \n\nThere is speculation that the envelope containing the Knicks logo was refrigerated beforehand, enabling David Stern to recognize and select it.\n\nAccording to another theory, some claim that when an accountant from Ernst & Whinney (the same firm used by Gulf + Western, then-owners of the Knicks) inserted the seven envelopes into the glass drum, some have claimed that he banged the fourth one against the side of the drum to create a creased corner, thereby making it easier for Stern to determine which envelope to choose: the envelope containing the Knicks logo. As the drum was being spun by NBA security director Jack Joyce, Stern was watching the envelopes closely. He then opened the drum, took a deep breath, reached in and selected the envelope with the bent corner and the Knicks logo.\n\n"}

It was held at the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York, on June 19, 1984, before the 1984–85 season. The draft is generally considered to be one of the greatest in NBA history, with four Hall of Famers being drafted in the first sixteen picks and five overall. It included Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, John Stockton and Akeem Olajuwon who was picked first. The draft was broadcast in the United States on the USA Network. In this draft, 23 NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. The Houston Rockets won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the Portland Trail Blazers, who obtained the Indiana Pacers' first-round pick in a trade, were awarded the second pick. The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win–loss record in the previous season. The Cleveland Cavaliers were awarded an extra first-round draft pick as compensation for the draft picks traded away by their previous owner, Ted Stepien. A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was automatically eligible for selection. Before the draft, five college underclassmen announced that they would leave college early and would be eligible for selection. Prior to the draft, the San Diego Clippers relocated to Los Angeles and became the Los Angeles Clippers. The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 228 players. This draft was the last to be held before the creation of the draft lottery in 1985. It was also the first NBA draft to be overseen by David Stern, who would continue as the commissioner of the league for the following 30 years.\n\nThe following list includes other draft picks who have appeared in at least one NBA game.\n\nThe following trades involving drafted players were made on the day of the draft.\n\nPrior to the day of the draft, the following trades were made and resulted in exchanges of picks between the teams.\n\nThe Houston Rockets used their first pick to draft Akeem Olajuwon, a junior center from the University of Houston. The Nigerian-born Olajuwon became the second foreign-born player to be drafted first overall, after Mychal Thompson from the Bahamas in 1978. The Portland Trail Blazers used the second overall pick to draft Sam Bowie from the University of Kentucky. The Chicago Bulls used the third pick to draft Naismith and Wooden College Player of the Year Michael Jordan from the University of North Carolina. Jordan went on to win the Rookie of the Year Award and was also selected to the All-NBA Second Team in his rookie season. Jordan's teammate at North Carolina, Sam Perkins, was drafted fourth by the Dallas Mavericks. Charles Barkley, a junior forward from Auburn University, was drafted fifth by the Philadelphia 76ers. Olajuwon, Jordan and Barkley, along with the 16th pick John Stockton and the 131st pick Oscar Schmidt, have been inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The first four mentioned players were also named in the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History list announced at the league's 50th anniversary in 1996. \n\nOlajuwon's achievements include two NBA championships, two Finals Most Valuable Player Awards, one Most Valuable Player Award, two Defensive Player of the Year Awards, twelve All-NBA Team selections, twelve All-Star Game selections and nine All-Defensive Team selections. Olajuwon retired as the all–time league leader in total blocked shots with 3,830 blocks. \n\nThe third pick, Jordan, achieved even greater success than Olajuwon. He won six NBA championships, six Finals Most Valuable Player Awards, five Most Valuable Player Awards, one Defensive Player of the Year Award, eleven All-NBA Team selections, fourteen All-Star Game selections, three NBA All Star Game MVP Awards, and nine All-Defensive Team selections. \n\nBarkley and Stockton never won an NBA championship, but both players received numerous awards and honors. Barkley won the Most Valuable Player in 1993 and was selected to eleven All-NBA Teams, eleven All-Star Games, and was the MVP of the 1991 All Star Game. Stockton was selected to eleven All-NBA Teams, ten All-Star Games and five All-Defensive Teams before retiring as the all–time league leader in assists and steals and was co-MVP of the 1993 All Star Game along with his Utah Jazz teammate Karl Malone. Jordan, Barkley and Stockton would later play as teammates for the 1992 \"Dream Team\". \n\nAlvin Robertson, the seventh pick, is the only other player from this draft who has won annual NBA awards as a player; he won both the Defensive Player of the Year Award and the Most Improved Player Award in 1986. He was also selected to one All-NBA Team, four All-Star Games, six consecutive All-Defensive Teams. Both Robertson and Olajuwon are among only four players in NBA history who have ever achieved the extremely rare feat of recording a quadruple double.\n\nTwo other players from this draft, ninth pick Otis Thorpe and eleventh pick Kevin Willis, were also selected to one All-Star Game each. Willis also had one selection to the All-NBA Team. Rick Carlisle, the 70th pick, became a coach after ending his playing career and won the Coach of the Year Award in 2002 while coaching the Detroit Pistons. In 2011, he coached the Dallas Mavericks to an NBA Championship.\nThe 1984 draft class is considered to be one of the best in NBA history as it produced five Hall of Famers and seven All-Stars. However, it was also marked by the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie, considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. It is believed that the Blazers picked Bowie over Michael Jordan because they already had an All Star shooting guard in Jim Paxson and a young shooting guard in Clyde Drexler, whom they drafted in the 1983 draft. Although Drexler went on to have a successful career, Bowie's career was cut short by injuries; he had missed two of the past three seasons in his college career as well. Despite having a 10-year career in the NBA and averaging 10.9 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, Bowie's career was interrupted by five leg surgeries, which limited him to 139 games in five years with the Blazers.\n\nBrazilian Oscar Schmidt was drafted with the 131st pick in the sixth round by the New Jersey Nets. However, Schmidt turned down the offers to play in the NBA and stayed to play in Italy and later in Brazil. He played in five Olympics and was the top scorer in three of them. He finished his career with 49,703 points with various clubs and the Brazilian national team, more than the NBA's career scoring leader, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who scored 38,387 points in his NBA career. In 2010, International Basketball Federation (FIBA) honored Schmidt with an induction to the FIBA Hall of Fame, and Schmidt was inducted by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nUniversity of Houston track and field Olympic Champion Carl Lewis, who had never played college basketball, was drafted by the Chicago Bulls with the 208th pick in the 10th round. Lewis would dominate the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in the summer of 1984. Lewis, who had also been drafted in NFL draft of the same year by the Dallas Cowboys, stayed with his athletics career and went on to win nine Olympic gold medals and eight World Championships gold medals.\n\nIn the fifth round, the Portland Trail Blazers drafted Mike Whitmarsh, who starred for the University of San Diego in both basketball and volleyball, with the 111th pick. Whitmarsh played professional basketball in Germany for three years, but never played in the NBA. He then left basketball to play beach volleyball, where he achieved greater success, including a silver medal in the Olympics.\n\nThe final pick in the 1984 Draft, number 228 by the Boston Celtics, was Dan Trant of Clark University. Trant never played in a regular season game for the Celtics. Trant was working in his office at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and was killed in the terrorist attacks that day.\n\nThis draft would be the last of the NBA that would be without any undrafted players entering the NBA. Starting from 1985 onward, multiple undrafted players from each year would enter the NBA, with more of them coming after the league decreased the number of rounds from the draft from 10 to the current two.\n\n\n"}

Then-owner Ted Stepien was infamous for repeatedly trading first-round picks in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which, considering Cleveland's morose records in that time period, eventually culminated in the NBA creating a rule banning teams from dealing all of their first-round picks in consecutive years.\n\nFour players from the 1983 draft later served or now serve as coaches—Doc Rivers for the Los Angeles Clippers, Randy Wittman for the Washington Wizards, Byron Scott for the Los Angeles Lakers from 2014 to 2016, and point guard of the 1983 NCAA championship North Carolina State Wolfpack Sidney Lowe.\n\nWhile Scott won the Coach of the Year award in 2008, Rivers won an NBA Championship with the Celtics in that same year. \n\n7’7” Manute Bol was selected in the 5th round by the Clippers, but the NBA rejected the pick on technicalities.

This draft marked the first time that the first three selections were college underclassmen. Danny Ainge, the 1981 Wooden College Player of the Year, was selected in the second round with the 31st pick by the Boston Celtics. Ainge had been playing professional baseball since 1979 with the Toronto Blue Jays in the Major League Baseball (MLB) while also playing college basketball at Brigham Young University.

The San Diego Clippers used their last pick in the draft, the 210th pick, to draft Tony Gwynn, who starred at both baseball and basketball at San Diego State University. Gwynn was also selected in the 1981 MLB draft by the San Diego Padres. He opted to play baseball and ended up playing 20 seasons with the Padres.

In this draft, 23 NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. The first two picks in the draft belonged to the teams that finished last in each conference, with the order determined by a coin flip. The Boston Celtics, who obtained the Detroit Pistons' first-round pick in a trade, won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the Utah Jazz were awarded the second pick. The Celtics then traded the first pick to the Golden State Warriors before the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win–loss record in the previous season. An expansion franchise, the Dallas Mavericks, took part in the NBA Draft for the first time and were assigned the eleventh pick in each round. A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was automatically eligible for selection. Before the draft, five college underclassmen announced that they would leave college early and would be eligible for selection.

A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was eligible for selection.\n\nIf a player left college early, he would not be eligible for selection until his college class graduated. Larry Bird would have been eligible to join this draft class because his \"junior eligible\" draft status from being taken by Boston in 1978 would expire the minute the 1979 draft began, but Bird and the Celtics agreed on a five-year contract on June 8 to avoid that. Before the draft, five college underclassmen were declared eligible for selection under the \"hardship\" rule. These players had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league, which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier.

In Ravinia Park's first summer of 1905, it hosted the New York Philharmonic, and the prairie style Martin Theater dates from this time period. It has been the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) since 1936. Located in Highland Park, Illinois, the festival operates on the grounds of the Ravinia Park, with a variety of outdoor and indoor performing arts facilities.\n\nThe Ravinia neighborhood, once an incorporated village before annexation in 1899, is known as Ravinia, and retained its own post office until autumn 2010. The business district on Roger Williams Ave., within walking distance from the Ravinia Festival grounds, includes neighborhood service businesses and restaurants. Ravinia takes its name from the ravines found nearby along the shoreline of Lake Michigan.\n\n\nIn 1904, the A.C. Frost Company created Ravinia as an amusement park intended to lure riders to the fledgling Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railroad. The amusement park boasted a baseball diamond, electric fountain and refectory or casino building with dining rooms and a dance floor. The prairie-style Martin Theatre (then called Ravinia Theatre) is the only building on the grounds that dates back to that original construction. When the park's existence became jeopardized following the railroad's bankruptcy, local residents (for the most part Chicago businessmen) formed a corporation in 1911 to purchase and operate the park. Music was a confirmed summer activity from then on, except for a brief hiatus during the Depression and during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the festival announced that it had cancelled all concerts for the 2020 season.\nOver 100 years later, Ravinia Festival is the oldest outdoor music festival in North America and is lauded for presenting world-class music. The festival attracts about 600,000 listeners to some 120 to 150 events that span all genres from classical music to jazz to music theater over each three-month summer season. Over the years, the festival has hosted many famous artists. In addition to symphony concerts, often with guest soloists, the festival presents opera, jazz, blues, folk, rock, and popular music performances, plus ballet, drama, and educational programs which take place year-round.\n\nRecent artists who have performed at Ravinia include John Legend, Aretha Franklin, Bryan Ferry, Diana Ross, Maroon 5, Common, Carrie Underwood, Tony Bennett, Lady Gaga, Josh Groban, Dolly Parton, Sheryl Crow, Patti LaBelle, Andrew Bird, Darius Rucker, Mary J. Blige, Gladys Knight, Santana, Stevie Nicks, Patti LuPone, Smokey Robinson, and John Mellencamp.\n\nFor most attendees, Ravinia is experienced on the 36 acre (150,000 m²) parkland and lawn. Ravinia is one of the few concert venues in the country to allow full meals to be brought in and consumed at concerts, even allowing alcoholic beverages. Accordingly, most grocery stores and specialty restaurants in and around the Highland Park area offer ready-to-eat \"Ravinia picnics\" for purchase.\n\nThe park is served by the Metra commuter railroad station Ravinia Park outside the front gate with special stops before and after concerts. (The noted British conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, who guest-conducted the CSO there in 1940, referred to Ravinia as \"the only railway station with a resident orchestra.\") Visitors get dropped off and picked up right at the front gate. Attendance often tops 600,000 annually.\n\n\nJames Levine was named \"Conductor Laureate\" in April 2017, to begin performances in summer 2018. On December 4, 2017, the Ravinia Festival severed all ties with Levine, in the wake of sexual abuse allegations against him, dating back to decades earlier at the Ravinia Festival.\n\n\n"}

The webcomic, which was originally intended for a niche audience of naturists, follows the inhabitants of a fictional nudist resort. \"Loxie & Zoot\" became somewhat notorious for the \"pleasant\" and realistic manner it presents its subject matter.\n\n\"Loxie & Zoot\" is set in the fictional Koala Bay Bares Naturist Resort, a nudist resort where its varied cast of characters, including its title characters Loxie and Zoot, reside. During the several storylines of \"Loxie & Zoot\", the inhabitants of the resort have to deal with a jewel thief, supernatural elements, and the villain Tex Tyler, who desires to shut the resort down. The world of \"Loxie & Zoot\" is presented in a very \"pleasant\" manner, with no cynicism or malice involved.\n\nGrace Crowley has been drawing comics since she was a child, and shortly after completing university, she found herself working for a publisher that specializes in educational comics, presenting realistic stories about specific heavy issues. Crowley stated that \"Loxie & Zoot\" \"kind of flowed out of that to a degree,\" noting that she was also reading many alternative, indie, and underground comics at the time. Crowley had enjoyed several visits to nude beaches during university, and figured a story about nudism could tap into a niche market. Crowley got one half-page cartoon of \"Loxie & Zoot\" published in an Australian nudist magazine in 1997, and in 1998, she started experimenting with publishing her story as a webcomic. However, because she was making the story up as she was going and was more focused on her day job, Crowley only managed to post nine pages before \"Loxie & Zoot\" went on an extended hiatus. Crowley attempted again in 2000, and managed to post the webcomic's first storyarc of 120 pages. On advice from Reinder Dijkhuis, Crowley transferred her webcomic to Keenspace in 2003, which prompted her to think more broadly of \"Loxie & Zoot\"s target audience.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Webcomics Examiner\", Crowley stated that she \"wanted to do a comic that went totally against the convention of comics of nudists that presented them all as young hour-glass figured women and chesty men.\" Furthermore, Crowley wanted to subvert the practice of strategically drawing nude characters from the waist up or partially obscured in order to cover genitals, playing against the taboos and stereotypes of nudity and sexuality.\n\nCrowley went on to create the superhero webcomic \"Magellan\" for the platform Graphic Smash. Crowley also created some webcomics for Webcomics Nation. After the conclusion of \"Loxie & Zoot\", Crowley began the spin-off webcomic \"The Bare Pit\".\n\nIn 2006, Crowley won a Ledger Award in the category for \"Talent Deserving Wider Recognition\". Despite its benign nature, \"Loxie & Zoot\" gained some notoriety among the webcomic community of its time due to its ubiquitous nudity.\n\n"}

{"id": "2065187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065187", "title": "Novena", "text": "Novena\n\nA novena (from Latin: \"novem\", \"nine\") is an ancient tradition of devotional praying in Christianity, consisting of private or public prayers repeated for nine successive days or weeks. The nine days between the Feast of the Ascension and Pentecost, when the disciples gathered in the upper room and devote themselves to prayer, is often considered to be the first novena.\n\nIn some Christian communities, such as in Africa, Latin America and the Philippines, novena traditions are popular and include devotional rituals such as congregational prayers, statue decoration, hymn singing with music, as well as community fiesta events over beverages, refreshments or processions. Individuals may express love and honor by kneeling, burning candles or placing flowers before the person represented by a statue. \n\nNovenas are most often prayed by members of the Roman Catholic Church, but also by Anglicans, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and Lutherans. In addition, novenas have also been used in an ecumenical Christian context, such as those promulgated by Premier Christian Radio in an effort to pray for church renewal.\n\nThe prayers are often derived from devotional prayer books, or consist of the recitation of the rosary (a \"rosary novena\"), or of short prayers through the day. Novena prayers are customarily printed in small booklets, and the novena is often dedicated to a specific angel, saint, a specific Marian title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or one of the personages of the Holy Trinity. In the Catholic tradition, much-used novena prayers include doctrinal statements in addition to a personal petition. The doctrinal part of the prayers are studied by its ecclesiastical staff, like formal translations of Christian scripture, and officially declared to be free of doctrinal errors with \"nihil obstat\" and \"imprimatur\".\n\nThe word \"Novena\" is rooted in the Latin word for nine. The practice of the novena is based in early Christianity, where Masses were held for nine days with devotional prayers to someone who has died. The practice may trace its origins to an early Greek and Roman custom performed by families, consisting of nine days of mourning after the death of a loved one, followed by a feast, which originally prompted Catholic writers such as St. Augustine, Pseudo-Alcuin and John Beleth to warn Christians not to emulate the custom.\n\nOver time, members of Roman Catholic faith began to associate novena with Christian themes such as the nine months Jesus spent in the womb, the giving up of His spirit at the ninth hour, and the event which occurred in the \"Upper Room\" with Twelve Apostles and the Blessed Virgin Mary when they prayed for nine days until the Holy Spirit descended on the Feast of the Pentecost. In the New Testament, this biblical event is often quoted from Acts of the Apostles, 1:12 – 2:5. The Church Fathers also assigned special meaning to the number nine, seeing it as symbolic of imperfect man turning to God in prayer (due to its proximity with the number ten, symbolic of perfection and God).\n\nThe practice of novena grew by the Middle Ages to include pious prayers for nine days before a feast in honor of a saint identified on a liturgical calendar. By the 11th century, the novena practice had become a means in Christianity of praying to petition spiritual or personal favor through a saint, such as Virgin Mary. After the Reformation and Counter-reformation era, the Catholic Church formally approved novenas, in particular through the papal approvals of a large number of novenas by Pope Pius IX.\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, there are three recognized categories of novenas, though this distinction is not exclusive:\n\n\nBy standard liturgical norms, novenas are performed in church, at home, or anywhere where solemn prayers are appropriate, though some indulgenced novenas require church attendance. Sometimes, a special candle or incense is lit at the beginning of the novena which burns during the nine days of prayer. The first chapter of the \"General Principles\" of Sacrosanctum Concilium, #13 is often cited as a guideline regarding the implementations of public novenas.\n\nWithin the Roman Catholic tradition, novena prayers typically include a praise of the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ or saint, acknowledgment of the Christian doctrines, and a personal petition. Other than the petition, the rest of much used prayers used in a public setting is studied by the clergy and then approved to be free from doctrinal and moral errors. The approval is given in the form of an Imprimatur, Nihil Obstat, and Imprimi potest. These ecclesiastical approval are usually granted by a bishop or any ranking prelate for publication and approval.\n\nNovenas have been a widespread practice in Catholic history. Novena prayers are also practised by Lutheran, Orthodox and Anglican Christians, who hold close or similar beliefs regarding its pious practice. In addition, novenas have also been used in an ecumenical Christian context, such as those promulgated by Premier Christian Radio, in order to pray for Church renewal.\n\nA novena is a ritualistic devotional worship where one or more Christian devotees make petitions, implore favors, or obtain graces by honoring Jesus Christ, Virgin Mary or the saints of the faith who are believed to empower divine intervention. According to Fenella Cannell – a professor of Anthropology specializing in Christianity, a Novena is \"a supplicatory act of worship\".\n\nIn Christian communities of Philippines and Latin America, novena traditions include devotional rituals in front of an altar, with nine levels where the Holy Cross is placed at the top. These are lit up with candles, decorated with flowers and other ritual items. Additionally, the space may have many statues decorated, and these statues typically include those of Virgin Mary, Apostles and saints of regional significance. The first day, the votive candles are placed on level one, and with each day the candles are raised by one level towards the Holy Cross. Further, each day includes congregational prayers, hymn singing with music, private and public devotionals. Some novenas include, sometimes on the last day, community fiesta events over beverages, refreshments or processions.\n\nRosary Novena is linked to religious death rituals. Among the Filipino Catholic Christians, the Rosary Novena has been a prayer practice for nine days starting the day when someone dies, with formal funeral services timed to the ninth day. Elsewhere, the day of funeral service or when the body is interred is timed to local customary practices, while the nine day novena is held at the home of the deceased as elsewhere.\n\nNovena practices were introduced into communities by Christian missionaries in their colonial era and postmodern era proselytization efforts in Africa, as well as new world plantation colonies where African slaves were settled such as in Brazil. These initiatives brought a sense of socioreligious community.\n\nSome practices are unique to Africa. Various denominations of Christianity in Africa have introduced regional novena practices that include devotional prayers, singing, and clap, wave, or shout offerings. The novena devotionalism in Ghana includes on each of the nine nights, after the loud prayers, the blood-covering of Jesus, where the devotees stain themselves considering it to be symbolism for the blood of Christ.\n\nAmong the coastal West African Christian communities, novena is a means of petitioning God through worship and fasting, along with traditional rituals. Syncretic new age religious practices in Nigeria have adopted the nine day of novena prayer ritualism. In Zimbabwe, according to Lawrence Daka – a professor and a Zimbabwean Jesuit,\n\nDevotional and paraliturgical novenas have been common in Europe as well as European settlers in North America. These have included public worship such as Mass and private praying with religious items such as a rosary and images particularly related to the Virgin Mary. According to James M. O'Toole – a professor of History specializing in American Catholic history, the period between World War I and mid 1950s were the \"heyday of American Catholic devotionalism\". This period witnessed novena devotionalism along with popularity of sodalities, confraternities, devotion to saints, meatless Fridays, holy cards, rosary, cross and eucharistic practices. These provided a sense of communal identification, states O'Toole, particularly in a time of mass migration. The novena had strong roots in ethnic neighborhoods, and devotional worship had sociopolitical links, offering a sense of communal security through religious symbols in a period of uncertainty and fear. As economic prosperity and a sense of national solidarity grew in and after the 1960s, the novena ritualism waned and the participation in church worship services fell.\nIn Eastern and Central Europe, novena practices continue. For example, novenas among the faithful in the Czech Republic include nine hour prayers dedicated to the Infant Jesus of Prague, where the devotee can plead personal urgent needs before the statue of the Christ Child, and on May 27 every year, the statue is ceremoniously paraded through the streets of Prague with prayers and songs. During the communist era, the devout orthodox Christians in the former Yugoslavia organized the Great Novena under the statue of Virgin Mary, to resist the state enforced atheism, to maintain the freedom to practice religion, and to re-assert the Christian legacy of the region, particularly in Croatia.\n\nIn Catholic Ireland, states Gladys Ganiel – a professor of Religion, devotional practices such as novenas have been popular. The cultural acceptance of devotional worship has been historically high, and those Irish who themselves do not perform novenas, nevertheless respect those who do. Some of their Catholic ritual practices were repressed by the British state during the 18th and 19th centuries, but repression and criticism only increased the resolve of the Irish to persist in their ways of practicing their faith.\n\nIn North America, annual novenas are observed in some regions such as in Montreal, Canada, where between March 10 and 19 the annual novena ends in a feast of Saint Joseph. A religious survey published in the 1921 Bulletin of the University of Notre Dame, states that novena prayers were popular, and particularly common among students during examinations, or illness, or after the death of a fellow student. The Novena-Seance remain popular in many regions of the United States, such as among the Roman Catholics of Louisiana where novenas are dedicated to St. Jude and the Virgin Mary. These novenas are prayers believed to create a contact between the saint and the devotee, and thereby invoke divine intervention in whatever problem or anxiety is important to the devotee.\n\nLas Posadas is a novena celebrated chiefly in Latin America, Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, and by Hispanics in the United States. It is typically celebrated each year between December 16 and December 24. \n\nThe novena has been an important part of Christianity in the Caribbean and Latin America, both among the native Indian communities who converted to Christianity under the colonial Spanish or Portuguese rule, as well as the diverse communities that formed anew from millions of slaves and indentured laborers brought to the Americas from different parts of Africa and Asia. The devotional prayers are dedicated to statues of Jesus Christ, Madonna and various saints. They are also a part of \"velorio\" (wake) after the death of someone, which includes nine nights of novena (\"rezos de los nueve días\").\n\nAccording to Patrick Taylor and Frederick Case, the attendance to Christian religious services has been low, except after the death of a loved one or a significant socio-political individual, and during the times of difficulty such as epidemics or a drought. Many perform devotional worship with rosaries within their home before images of Christ and the Christian saints in a small dedicated altar within their living spaces. Like proselytism in Africa and Asia, missionaries of various denominations of Christianity, including Protestantism, have championed novenas in Hispanic-Latino communities as a part of their efforts to attract new converts to their ministries.\n\nNovenas are still a common sight in India, especially in the state of Kerala. They are practised by Roman Catholics and oriental Catholics (e.g. Syro-Malabar Christians and Syro-Malankara Christians), and by the Orthodox Christians (Malankara Orthodox Christians and Jacobite Orthodox Christians). Novenas are common to Mother Mary (recited every Saturday), Saint George (common by the Orthodox and recited every Wednesday), Saint Jude and others.\n\nNovenas remain a popular devotional practice in the Philippines. It is observed, for example, in the \"Simbang Gabi\" immediately preceding Christmas, and the novena preceding the Feast of the Santo Niño de Cebú (Holy Child) on the third Sunday of January. The first nine days are marked with prayers, petitions and singing. During the main procession, the Santo Niño image is taken through the streets of Cebu City, with many people carrying their own replicas, decorated according to their own tastes. In Loboc, Bohol, the most popular novena is dedicated to a Black Madonna statue, with each service called the \"Gozos\", which includes a chanting of praises to the Virgin in Spanish and Visayan, dancing, choir recitals, and a feast with fireworks on the last day.\n\nIn Manila, popular novenas to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Saint Jude Thaddeus, and the Black Nazarene are assigned to the last three days of the week. Each novena is associated with a particular shrine, and have all been approved by the Holy See. Some organizations have also begun offering the novena rituals online for devotees. \n\nThe Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help is observed on nine consecutive Wednesdays in Baclaran. The Saint Jude novena on Thursdays invokes the apostle's status as the Patron Saint of Lost Causes, and is popular with students taking examinations. The Black Nazarene novena held on Fridays marks the journey of Christ with the cross to his crucifixion. The image, novena, and associated devotional practices have a large following. In 2011, over six million Catholic devotees flocked to the Black Nazarene procession in Manila alone. \n\nIn 19th century Melanesia, the Christian clergy linked the end of epidemics such as the measles of 1860, and credited the survival of the communities after major disasters to the dedicated and great outburst of prayers to Christian icons, to \"fervent novena\". Similarly, the Black Madonna novenas in Luboc started after similar crediting by the Christian clergy that the island community survived after a severe epidemic of cholera because they made devotional prayers to the Virgin Mary (Madonna) during their time of suffering.\n\n\n\n"}

Two NBA rookies of the year were picked in the first round, as Jason Kidd and Grant Hill were co-winners of the award for the 1994–95 NBA season. Kidd and Hill would end up as perennial All-Stars (10 and 7-time selections, respectively), though Hill's career was marred by severe injuries.\n\nThe first overall pick Glenn Robinson was involved in a contract holdout shortly after being selected, reportedly seeking a 13-year, $100 million contract. Both Robinson and the Milwaukee Bucks eventually agreed on a 10-year, $68 million contract, which once stood as the richest NBA contract ever signed by a rookie. A fixed salary cap for rookies was implemented by the NBA the following season. Robinson himself had a productive NBA career, becoming a two-time NBA All-Star and winning an NBA Championship in 2005 in his final year with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nNotably, this is the final draft to date to see all of the first three picks make All-Star rosters with the teams that originally drafted them.\n\nThese players went undrafted in 1994 but played in the NBA.\n\n"}

It marked the first NBA draft to be held outside the United States and was the first draft for the two Canadian expansion teams, Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies. Kevin Garnett, who was taken fifth in this draft, is notable for being the first player in two decades to be selected straight out of high school. Garnett would go on to gather fifteen All Star selections, eight All-NBA selections (four of those being First-Teams), one NBA MVP award, and multiple other accolades. Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse also had\nsuccessful careers, being four-time and two-time All-Stars respectively. Wallace won an NBA championship in 2004 with the Detroit Pistons, while Stackhouse scored the most total points in the league in 2000, also with the Pistons.\n\nThe other remaining top selections had relatively productive careers, but were considered to have never reached their full potential. Joe Smith put up solid, but unspectacular numbers throughout his career and is generally considered a disappointment for a first overall selection. He was also involved in a salary cap scandal with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Antonio McDyess was a one-time All-Star, but serious and continuing knee injuries decreased much of his effectiveness in the prime of his career. Damon Stoudamire was the 1995–96 NBA Rookie of the Year and had a solid career although he was arrested, suspended and fined several times for marijuana possession. Bryant Reeves impressed early in his career but a season after being granted a six-year, $61.8 million contract extension, his numbers went down due to weight and back problems and he retired after only playing six NBA seasons, all with the Vancouver Grizzlies.\n\nThis draft was also notable for two of the biggest busts in NBA history, Ed O'Bannon and Shawn Respert. O'Bannon had received national accolades for leading the UCLA Bruins to the NCAA Championship, but only played two years in the NBA. Respert played only four seasons in the NBA, while secretly hiding that he was suffering from stomach cancer.\n\nThe following players went undrafted in the 1995 NBA Draft but later played in the NBA.\n\nThe following trades involving drafted players were made on the day of the draft.\n\n"}

It uses a MIDI-based system for storing events, and the most recent versions save music in MWK files, similar to Standard MIDI Files with additional text and symbol events. Currently, Voyetra offers three editions of Music Write: Starter Kit, Songwriter edition, and Maestro edition. All support printing, MIDI recording, and MIDI playback granted the user has the appropriate hardware.\n\nThe Starter Kit is targeted for students and beginners. It supports note values up to sixteenth notes. It also supports a maximum of two staves with two voices on each.\n\nThe Songwriter edition supports note values down to sixteenth notes. It supports a maximum of eight tracks, and each may have up to two staves (such as a piano grand staff on one track). In addition, the Songwriter edition allows the user to create drum notation, and customize chords and fonts. In an older version of Music Write, entitled Music Write 2000, this edition was called the \"Standard Edition\".\n\nThe Maestro edition is the top-of-the-line for Music Write. has the same features as the Songwriter edition, but in addition to a notation editor, has a piano roll note editor (similar to piano rolls in player pianos); a control editor; a song editor; a software mixer; an event list; and comments box. 47 tracks per file are supported, and each track may have up to two staves as well. Unlike the Starter Kit and Songwriter edition, the Maestro edition supports note values up to 64th-notes and can export notation to a BMP or TIFF picture file. Previously, the Maestro Edition was entitled the \"Professional Edition\".\n\nBefore rebranding into the three editions described above, Voyetra released the original \"Music Write\" and \"Music Write Plus\" software for Windows 95/98. These were similar to, and later released as, the Starter Kit edition. Unlike their modern counterparts which share a common \"MWK\" proprietary format for saving data, the original MW/MWP saved in a different and now obsolete PBL format (.pbl extension). MWP was able to save MIDI as well, but Music Write did not have this feature.\n\nAs these programs are not compatible with Windows 2000 or later, and the current editions do not support PBL, users may find they are unable to open legacy scores created with MW / MWP.

It was held on June 26, 1996 at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. In this draft, NBA teams took turns selecting college basketball players and other first-time eligible players, such as players from high schools and non-North American leagues. The Vancouver Grizzlies had the highest probability to win the NBA draft lottery, but since they were an expansion team along with the Toronto Raptors, they were not allowed to select first in this draft. The team with the second-highest probability, the Philadelphia 76ers, won the lottery and obtained the first selection. The Toronto Raptors and the Vancouver Grizzlies were second and third respectively.\n\nAllen Iverson, a sophomore from Georgetown was selected first overall by the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nIt is widely considered to be one of the deepest and most talented NBA drafts in history, with one-third of the first round picks later becoming NBA All-Stars. The draft class produced three players who won NBA MVP awards (Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Steve Nash), seven other drafted players who became All-Stars (Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Ray Allen, Žydrūnas Ilgauskas, Stephon Marbury, Jermaine O'Neal, Peja Stojaković, Antoine Walker), and one undrafted All-Star (Ben Wallace), for a grand total of 11 All-Stars. Moreover, eight players from this draft class have been named to at least one All-NBA Team, the most among any draft. The draft class also produced three players who have been named to the NBA's all-defensive first team: Bryant, Marcus Camby, and Wallace. Camby won the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2007, while Wallace earned the same award in 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006.

It's located in the historic Carriage Town district area of downtown Flint, Michigan. In 2019 it became the home field for the Flint City Bucks, a soccer club that competes in USL League Two, as well as Powers Catholic High School. The annual Vehicle City Gridiron Classic also opens the high school football season at Atwood Stadium, with six to eight teams competing each season. The Flint Institute of Music hosts an annual Independence Day concert in the stadium, which is coordinated with Flint's fireworks display, which is launched from the Chevy Commons park, located to the south immediately across the Flint River from the stadium.\n\nThe stadium was named after Edwin W. Atwood, who was elected as the Mayor of the City of Flint in 1920, and also donated a portion of the site for the stadium. It has hosted boxing matches, UAW strikes, high school football, minor-league baseball, election stump speeches, and concerts over the years. Originally Atwood Stadium had a natural grass field, but in 1968 began using artificial turf. Atwood's turf was ruled unsafe, leading to the stadium's closure in 1992. The stadium reopened in 1995 after $3.5 million in improvements, including a new artificial turf field, and resumed hosting football games for Flint Community Schools. \n\nKettering University received ownership after Flint Emergency Manager Mike Brown ordered the city to transfer ownership in 2013, with the university undertaking the cost of emergency repairs to permit the stadium to continue operation. In 2015 the stadium underwent over $2 million in renovations to the restrooms, press box, concourse, exterior and playing field, and hosted Powers Catholic, Flint Southwestern and Flint Northwestern high school football in the fall of 2015. The new FieldTurf surface has permanent lines for regulation high school football, soccer, and lacrosse. The field goal posts are permanently mounted whereas soccer and lacrosse goals are moved into position as needed. As the field goal uprights are not hinged and therefore cannot tipped back during soccer matches, the uprights are in bounds above the soccer goal.\n\nSince 2019, the Flint City Bucks soccer team and Powers Catholic High School's football, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls lacrosse, and marching band programs share Atwood Stadium as their home field. Kettering University's intramural and recreational sports programs also extensively use the field, however the university has no varsity intercollegiate athletic programs. Perhaps uniquely, Atwood Stadium is a university-owned public stadium which has permanent regulation markings for high school football but no such markings for college football.\n\nThe stadium seating surrounds the field on three sides and is open on the south side, allowing spectators to overlook the paved parking area, the Flint River, and Chevy Commons park beyond. A Genesee County park trail runs along the south edge of the Atwood Stadium paved parking lot along the riverside. Kettering University leaves a portion of the paved parking area publicly accessible to allow residents to fish the river.\n\nThe stadium received its nickname, \"The Beautiful Stadium of Ours,\" from the River Rats, the original Bucks supporters' group. The group's tradition is to sing about the stadium as they march to every home match.\n\nAtwood Stadium opened on June 8, 1929 and was named after Edwin W. Atwood who donated a portion of the site for the stadium. \n\nFrom 1930 through 1976 the Annual Football game between Flint Central High School with Lynn Chandnois and Tony Branoff and Flint Northern High School with Leroy Bolden and Ellis Duckett who played on Thanksgiving Day and drew attendance in the tens of thousands of people. The 1950 game with Branoff, Duckett, and Bolden drew a record crowd of 20,600, thanks to standing room and temporary seating. Due to the development of state playoffs after 1976, the game was no longer held on Thanksgiving Day. Prior to the closure of Flint Central in 2009, Central won the overall series 41-39-1. Only four of the 81 meetings were not held at Atwood. The inaugural meeting in 1928 was held at Dort Field behind Flint Central. The 1929 meeting was held at Viking Field behind the original Flint Northern. Due to the stadium's temporary closure in 1992, the 1993 and 1994 Central-Northern games were held at Guy V. Houston Stadium, located near Flint Northwestern.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered a speech at the stadium in 1936.\n\nThe minor league baseball Flint Arrows played at the stadium from 1948-1951. The Arrows were a Class A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.\n\nAtwood Stadium was renovated in 1966 with new ticket booths, a larger press box, improved lighting and new sod. The renovation also made Atwood an exclusive football stadium. After the sod failed the following year, Astroturf was installed in 1968.\n\nThe homecoming concert of American Idol Contestant LaKisha Jones was held here on June 9, 2007. More recently, it hosted a homecoming tribute to 2009 Heisman Trophy winner and Flint Southwestern Academy graduate Mark Ingram, Jr. \n\nCity of Flint Emergency Manager Mike Brown signed over ownership of Atwood Stadium in 2013 to Kettering University.\n\nIn the past Atwood Stadium hosted the Michigan Invitational Tournament, a high school marching band competition hosted by Flushing High School, which at the time was one of the longest-running marching band competitions in Michigan.\n\nAtwood was home to the annual season opening game between Flint Northwestern and Flint Beecher. Beecher is coached by former NFL player Courtney Hawkins, while Northwestern also has a famous alum as a coach, former NFL wide receiver Andre Rison. Beecher won the 2010 opener, 28-18, while Northwestern took the 2011 opener, 46-44, in double overtime. During odd-numbered years, it was also been the site of Powers Catholic's football game against Nouvel Catholic Central High School; when Powers is the home team, it was usually played at the beginning of the season.\n\nWith community gifts from Diplomat Pharmacy, Charles Stewart Mott Foundation and Kettering University in 2015, the university oversaw over $2 million in renovations and improvements to help reopen the stadium in time for the 2015 high school football season. Since then, the Flint high schools have consolidated and no longer use Atwood Stadium as a home stadium. This alleviated scheduling conflicts which occasionally displaced Flint Southwestern home openers to Guy Houston Stadium.\n\nSince 2017, Atwood Stadium has hosted the Vehicle City Gridiron Classic to mark the start of the Michigan high school football season. Six to eight teams participate. Although Powers Catholic had previously played games over several seasons at Atwood Stadium as the home team, the school formally adopted Atwood Stadium as its home field for football, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls lacrosse, and marching band in 2019, using it as the site of competition and practice. Powers Catholic shares the \"home of\" title with the Flint City Bucks USL League Two soccer team, who also moved to Atwood Stadium in 2019.\n\nIn April 2020, Kettering University partnered with Hurley Medical Center to allow the hospital to set up a drive through COVID-19 testing clinic at the stadium, which is located one block south of the hospital.\n\nThe Atwood Stadium Races, formerly the Tuuri, is set of road races, kid's dash, 5K and 10K, that begin and end at the stadium and hosted by the Crim Fitness Foundation in partnership with Kettering University. . The races are typically held on the fourth Saturday in July. It is an official Crim Training Program voucher race and is known as a training race for the Crim. Racers can choose to run the \"duo\", both races.\n\nThe Tuuri 10K road race, named after Flint pediatrician Arthur L. Tuuri, began in 1979. The first four years, the winners won with sub-30-minute times. In 1981, Greg Meyer, a Michigan native, set the record of 29:28. In 1991, the race had its peak number of finisher with 1,176. In 2010, the Hurley Foundation ran its last Tuuri road race despite it being one of top Flint area races with 856 runners in 2010.\n\nA committee of runners led by Brian and Dorie Barkey attempt to have the Turri race be continued by Hurley or picked up by the Crim Fitness Foundation. Instead the committee staged the races in 2011 as the Atwood Stadium Road Races, hoping the nearby Carriage Town Ministries' festival would help the race and vice versa. The 10K and 5K had only changes to it starting and ending at Atwood Stadium. In 2018 and 2019, Kettering University operated the road races with the route being changed taking the runners past Chevy Commons, the Flint River Trail, Mott Park, the Educare Center, Glenwood Cemetery and Kettering's new Mobility Research Center.\n\n"}

Leading up to the draft, there was no doubt that Tim Duncan would be selected at No. 1 by the Spurs, and the rest of the draft was regarded with some skepticism. The Celtics had the third and sixth picks, selecting Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer, both of whom were traded in the next two years.\n\nThe Washington Wizards forfeited their 1997 first-round pick in connection with the signing of Juwan Howard.

The song saw considerable success in the United States, where it reached the number-two position in October 1989 and became the band's only top-ten entry on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In the United Kingdom, the single charted at number 18, and it additionally peaked within the top 20 in Canada and Ireland.\n\nThe song has been covered by several artists, with notable cover versions by American rock band 311, recorded for the soundtrack for the film \"50 First Dates\" and also released as a single. This song was also performed by Adele on her 2011 album \"21\".\n\nThe song is performed in A minor and is built around a distinctive bass riff. The verses follow an Am/G/F/Em chord progression, which changes to F/G/Am/C in the choruses. The lyrics are simple, with each verse having the same structure (\"Whenever I'm alone with you / you make me feel like I am ... again\"). Speaking of its simplicity and unusually upbeat nature compared to the other tracks on \"Disintegration\", Smith stated, \"It's an open show of emotion. It's not trying to be clever. It's taken me ten years to reach the point where I feel comfortable singing a very straightforward love song\".\n\nThe single version of the song is almost exactly the same as the album version, but the mix is slightly different, with extra reverb and harmonies added to Smith's vocals. In addition, in the instrumental section between the first two verses, the guitar does not join the keyboards as it does on the album.\n\nUpon release as a single, the song received worldwide success, and first peaked at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making it the group's most successful single in the US to date. The song also charted at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart, number 30 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. Robert Smith originally wrote the song for his long-time girlfriend and then fiancée, Mary, as a wedding present.\n\nAn instrumental demo version recorded by the band was featured on the second disk of the 2010 re-release of \"Disintegration\".\n\nA music video featuring the band performing inside a cave was also released with the single.\n\nSimilar to the title variations of The Cure song \"In Between Days\", there doesn't seem to be a universally agreed-upon spacing method of the title of Lovesong, as it varies between \"\"Lovesong\"\" and \"\"Love Song\"\" on many official Cure releases. The original 1989 artwork for the album \"Disintegration\" uses \"\"Love Song\"\" on the track listing and \"\"Lovesong\"\" on the lyrics sheet: the revised art for the 2010 remaster of the album consistently uses \"\"Lovesong\"\". When released as a single in 1989, the cover artwork displayed the title as \"\"Lovesong\"\", while the printing on the disc itself read \"\"Love Song\"\" all three times. Subsequent releases of \"Paris\" and \"Galore\" both use \"\"Lovesong\"\" exclusively, while 2001's \"Greatest Hits\" compilation uses \"\"Lovesong\"\" on the track listing and \"\"Love Song\"\" within the liner notes. 2004's \"\" also uses \"\"Lovesong\"\" within the booklet presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Song was released as a single by the band 311 and is featured on the soundtrack of the 2004 film \"50 First Dates\". It is also featured on 311's greatest hits album, \"Greatest Hits '93–'03\".\n\nWhile The Cure's original version hit number 2 on the Alternative Songs chart, 311's cover was more successful on the chart, hitting number 1 on the chart. However, The Cure's original version was still more successful on the pop charts, peaking number 2 on the Hot 100 chart, while 311's cover peaked at number 59 on the chart. 311's cover was also very successful in the adult contemporary radio market, hitting the top 10 on the Adult Top 40 chart at number 7. While The Cure's original version uses gothic rock elements, 311's cover is a love song with many reggae rock roots similar to their 2002 hit \"Amber\".\n\nThe music video features 311 playing the song in a bar.\n\n\nThe track has been covered by Jes in various trance and acoustic styles, as well as The Brunettes for the 2008 American Laundromat Records tribute album \"Just Like Heaven – a tribute to The Cure\". The song has also been covered by the bands A Perfect Circle (as a mashup with \"Diary of a Madman\"), Good Charlotte, The Deluxtone Rockets, Jack Off Jill, Snake River Conspiracy, Azam Ali/Niyaz, Death Cab for Cutie, Anberlin, Seafood (who released their cover of the song as a single in June 2007) and Fordirelifesake. Canadian musical duo Dala recorded their cover of the song on the 2005 album \"Angels & Thieves\". Canadian psychobilly band The Brains recorded their version of the song in 2014 on their \"The Cover Up\" EP.\n\nSolo artists have performed covers as well, such as Tori Amos during several live performances, most famously on the radio station KROQ-FM. Naimee Coleman included an interpretation of the song on her 2001 album \"Bring Down The Moon\". Voltaire released an acoustic cover on his album \"Then and Again\". It was also covered by Maltese singer Ira Losco, found on her 2007 unplugged album \"Unmasked\". Japanese singer Immi included a cover of the song on her debut album \"Switch\". British singer Adele included a bossa nova cover of the song on her second album, \"21.\" which peaked at #18 on \"Billboard\"'s Smooth Jazz Songs chart. Nina Sky covered this song on their 2010 EP \"The Other Side\".\n\nThe song was covered by Captain during a BBC Radio 2 live session with Dermot O'Leary. The American Indie-pop band Koufax covered it in several live apparitions. \n\nThe Big Pink provided a cover of \"Lovesong\" for The Cure tribute album \"Pictures of You: A Tribute to Godlike Geniuses The Cure\", which was made available with the February 25, 2009 issue of \"NME\". \n\n"}

His early work concentrated on table-top and wall-mounted sculpture; but, in the mid-1980s, he shifted his focus to large free-standing works, often in bronze. In the 1990s, he added a variety of other materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum and stained glass. His interest in large outdoor works also led him to an interest in public art. He is the husband of actress Meryl Streep.\n\nCritic Irving Sandler (writing in \"Art in America\", January 2005) has noted that Gummer's work is recognizably rooted in constructivism, but also writes that \"in extending and deflecting Constructivist art in a new direction, Gummer has rendered it peculiarly contemporary.\" Sandler also writes that Gummer's works \"give postmodern life to classic principles of abstract composition.\" \n\nGummer was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on December 12, 1946, and grew up in Indiana. He studied at Ben Davis High School, Indianapolis, and then at the Herron School of Art from 1964 to 1966. From 1966 to 1970, he studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, and then completed his studies at the Yale School of Art where he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) and Master of Fine Arts (MFA), and studied with David von Schlegell.\n\nGummer's first solo show was in 1973. Since then, his works have been featured at two dozen solo shows at museums and galleries around the East Coast and Midwest. His work has also been exhibited in group shows.\n\nGummer's commissioned works have included \"Primary Compass\" (2000), a site-specific outdoor permanent sculpture at the Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio and a sculpture/fountain in Historic New Harmony, New Harmony, Indiana. One stainless steel and stained glass sculpture, \"Southern Circle\", standing tall and weighing approximately 20,000 pounds, was commissioned by the city of Indianapolis and dedicated in October, 2004. \"Primary Separation\", a permanent installation at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, was completed in 2006.\n\nGummer, the son of Dorothy Ann (née Jacobson) and William Adolph Gummer, has five brothers: William, Jack, Richard, Steven, and Mark. He married Peggy Lucas in the early seventies but divorced shortly after. Gummer married actress Meryl Streep on September 30, 1978. They have four children: musician Henry Wolfe, model Louisa, and actresses Mamie and Grace. Gummer and Streep are active philanthropists who donate to a range of arts organizations and educational institutions, including Vassar College, Opus School in Harlem, and the Silver Mountain Arts Foundation.\n\n\n\n"}

She was named for John Lorimer Worden.\n\n\"Worden\" was laid down on 30 June 1919 at Squantum, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 24 October 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Emilie Neilson Worden; and commissioned on 24 February 1920 at the Boston Navy Yard, Lieutenant Commander David H. Stuart in command.\n\nThe destroyer spent the first four years of her decade of active service in operations along the Atlantic coast of the United States. After fitting out, she departed Boston loaded torpedoes and spare parts at Newport, Rhode Island, and embarked upon her shakedown cruise to Key West and Cuban waters. She completed that voyage at New York on 1 May and joined Destroyer Division 42, 3d Squadron, Atlantic Fleet. From May to July, she conducted operations along the length of the Atlantic seaboard, from Key West to Newport. On 21 July, she arrived in Charleston and remained there until the following summer. On 25 June 1921, she departed Charleston, South Carolina for a 4 July visit to New York and gunnery practice off Block Island. In August, she made a voyage to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with Naval Academy midshipmen embarked, returning them to Annapolis, Maryland, on the 22nd.\n\n\"Worden\" stopped briefly at Hampton Roads, then headed via New York to Boston for repairs at the navy yard which she completed early in November. On the 16th, she loaded torpedoes at Newport and headed south to Charleston, where she arrived on the 18th. She remained there until the spring of 1922. On 29 May of that year, she got underway for a voyage which took her up the coast to Philadelphia; thence to Yorktown, Virginia, a temporary base for battle practice and gunnery drills. Late in July, \"Worden\" made a brief cruise to New York and then returned to the southern drill grounds located off the Virginia capes.\n\nDuring August, September, and October, she conducted battle practice off the capes, departing the area periodically for visits to New York; Beaufort, North Carolina; and Newport. On 21 November, the destroyer entered port at Boston for a repair period which lasted until the end of 1922. Shen then left Boston and loaded torpedoes at Newport on New Year's Day 1923. On 5 January, she arrived at Lynnhaven Roads, Virginia, but, soon thereafter, continued south to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where she resumed gun and torpedo drills through the end of the month. On 12 February, she transited the Panama Canal with the Scouting Fleet for Fleet Problem I, the first set of combined maneuvers with Battle Fleet, conducted in the Gulf of Panama. She retransited the canal on 27 March and resumed training in the Guantanamo Bay area until late April.\n\nAfter visits to several gulf coast ports (Galveston, Texas, New Orleans, Louisiana, Tampa, Florida and Key West) she returned to Newport on 15 May. Early in June, she visited Washington, D.C., and, by mid-month, had entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs. \"Worden\" left Philadelphia on 12 October and resumed gunnery drills and battle practice at the southern drill grounds off the Virginia capes. Those drills, punctuated by visits to Fall River, Massachusetts, and to Baltimore, Maryland, occupied her time until mid-November, at which time she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs to a ruptured boiler.\n\nOn 3 January 1924, \"Worden\" departed Philadelphia and, after a brief stop at Lynnhaven Roads, rendezvoused with Scouting Fleet as a unit of its screen. Conducting drills and exercises along the way, Scouting Fleet headed for Colón, Panama, where the warships refueled before continuing on to Culebra Island with the combined United States Fleet (Scouting Fleet and Battle Fleet). \"Worden\" participated in the annual spring exercises in the West Indies until late spring. On 4 May, she arrived back in Philadelphia to prepare for her first and only deployment outside the western hemisphere. After a brief repair period at Boston and a visit to Newport, under the command of Commander Allen B. Reed USN she headed across the Atlantic in mid-June. On the 27th, she passed through the Strait of Gibraltar to begin a year of duty with the United States Naval Forces Europe. During the early portion of that tour, \"Worden\" called at Palermo, Sicily, and then headed for the Adriatic Sea.\n\nHer tour in the Adriatic was probably influenced by the murder of two Americans in the newly established state of Albania and the internal strife which followed and which resulted in the ousting of prime minister Ahmed Zogu and his temporary replacement by a provisional government under Fan S. Noli. During her stay in the Adriatic, \"Worden\" visited Pula (now Croatia) and Venice in Italy and Split (now Croatia) in Kingdom of Yugoslavia as well as Durrës in troubled Albania.\n\nLater in the year, the destroyer left the Mediterranean for visits to Gravesend, England, Cherbourg, France, Leith, Scotland and Amsterdam in the Netherlands. At the conclusion of that circuit, she returned to the Mediterranean and continued her tour of duty with Naval Forces, Europe, until the summer of 1925.\n\nShe returned to New York on 16 July of that year and resumed her former schedule of operations with the Scouting Fleet. On 13 September, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs. The destroyer did not leave the yard until December. On the 7th, she headed south to join in the annual winter maneuvers held in the West Indies and in Panama Bay on the Pacific side of the isthmus. Scouting Fleet transited the canal on 4 and 5 February 1926 to join Battle Fleet for Fleet Problem VI in Panama Bay. In March, \"Worden\" returned to the Caribbean with Scouting Fleet and resumed battle practice, gunnery drills, and torpedo exercises in the West Indies. She completed that phase of her 1926 training schedule late in the spring and arrived back in Philadelphia on 5 May. During the early part of the summer, the warship continued her training schedule, this time off the New England coast near Narragansett Bay. On 2 July, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for a three-month repair period.\n\nOn 11 October, \"Worden\" stood out of Philadelphia on her way south once more. After a brief stop at Hampton Roads, the destroyer continued on her way and arrived in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the 16th. For the next month, she conducted engineering trials and battle practice near Haiti in the Gulf of Gonaives. Returning north in mid-November, she visited the Naval Academy for a time before heading back to Philadelphia where she arrived on 15 December. The warship bade farewell to Philadelphia once again on 5 January 1927 and pointed her bow southward for a stop at Yorktown followed by the 1927 edition of the annual winter maneuvers. She reached Guantanamo Bay on 12 January and commenced gunnery and battle practice with Scouting Fleet in preparation for the annual Fleet problem.\n\nIn contrast to the previous fleet problems in which she had participated, Fleet Problem VII brought Battle Fleet to the Caribbean instead of taking Scouting Fleet to the Pacific. The exercise was staged in March; and, by late April, \"Worden\" had returned north, this time to New York City. During the summer of 1927, she conducted normal training exercises off the Atlantic coast and participated in the Fleet Review conducted off Cape Henry, Virginia, in June for President Calvin Coolidge. On 11 September, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard and remained there for the rest of the year.\n\nOn 7 January 1928, she started south from Philadelphia. This time, however, she participated only in the preliminary drills and exercises for the annual fleet problem. She headed back to Philadelphia in April and arrived there on the 14th. Meanwhile, Scouting Fleet and Battle Fleet joined and executed Fleet Problem VIII in the broad expanse of the Pacific between San Francisco, and the Hawaiian Islands. A month later, \"Worden\" returned to sea for her usual round of operations along the Atlantic seaboard. That duty lasted until late in October at which time her base of operations changed to Charleston. Local operations out of that port occupied her time until early December when she returned north to Philadelphia for a month. In January 1929, she moved to Norfolk for repairs to her turbines; and, after post-repair trials in the Chesapeake Bay in February, she headed south for winter maneuvers. The destroyer arrived at Guantanamo Bay on 28 February. She concluded her part in those exercises later in the spring and returned north, arriving in New York on 2 May.\n\nDuring the summer, she conducted normal operations along the northeastern coast.\n\nOn 21 September, \"Worden\" arrived in Philadelphia. The warship remained there until she was decommissioned on 1 May 1930. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 22 October 1930, and she was sold for scrapping on 17 January 1931 according to the \"Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships\". Other sources state she was converted into an express fruit carrier MV \"Tabasco\"\n\nSee for other ships of this name.\n\n\n"}

Formed in 1995 under the name Hinge, they have released three albums.\n\nAfter being together as a band for four years, they recorded and released (under their previous band name, Hinge) their first EP in 1997 titled \"Cause Moshing is Good Fun\" under Psychodrama Records – the band's own label.\n\nThe band's second EP \"Elemental Evil\" (1999) was once again released through their own label. The nine-track disc led them to open for many well-recognized acts including Coal Chamber, Incubus, Anthrax and System of a Down.\n\nIn 2000, Hinge signed a record deal with Roadrunner Records. After signing with the label, they were forced to change their name due to a recording studio owning the copyright to the same name. They briefly changed their name from Hinge to Hinge A.D., but ultimately settled upon Dry Kill Logic after the studio threatened legal action if they used the word \"Hinge\" anywhere in their name.\n\nOn June 5, 2001, their debut album \"The Darker Side of Nonsense\" was released. The album features a guest spot from Primer 55 members J-Sin (vocals) and Bobby Burns (guitar) on the track \"Give Up, Give In, Lie Down\". The band spent the better part of 2001 and 2002 on tour, performing around the world with such bands as Fear Factory, Kittie, Ill Niño, Spineshank, Saliva, Slayer and many others. The album went on to sell approximately 100,000 copies worldwide. However, due to Roadrunner wanting \"a more commercial sound on the band's second effort\", the band decided to part ways with the label in October 2002. Around the same time, the band split with guitarist Scott Thompson, replacing him with former Gargantua Soul guitarist Jason Bozzi, who remains with the group to this day.\n\nOn October 5, 2004, the band released their second major album \"The Dead and Dreaming\", via Psychodrama Music Group with deals through two independent record labels – Repossession Records and German label SPV Records. This forward thinking arrangement was spearheaded by PMG and not only ensured a simultaneous worldwide release but also positioned the band to be the driving force behind every aspect of their career. Heading back in their van in 2004 the band toured for 15 months straight, beginning with Motörhead in Germany and working their way up to co-headlining tours with Hed PE and Drowning Pool, culminating with being hand picked by Dave Mustaine to become a crowd favorite on the 2005 Gigantour arena tour. The band also made waves overseas, and in 2006 headlined two tours of the UK and Europe as well as touring Australia with Fear Factory and Devildriver.\n\nOn June 27, 2006, the band produced, designed and directed their first DVD/EP, \"The Magellan Complex\", which was a lead up for the band's upcoming album. The disc includes three songs and a bonus DVD consisting of the music video for \"Paper Tiger\", a live performance/interview piece from the Otep/American Head Charge tour (February 2005, New Orleans) as well as behind the scenes footage of the band on tour. This project was put together by the band for the fans, and includes artwork by guitarist Jason Bozzi, audio production by Phil Arcuri and video direction by Cliff Rigano. The band also demanded a low retail price in order to make the product more affordable for their fans worldwide.\n\nOn September 19, 2006, Dry Kill Logic's third full-length album \"Of Vengeance and Violence\" was released worldwide via Psychodrama/Repossession Records. The band embarked on tours of Australia and Europe throughout 2006. The band has plans for performances in the United States, Canada and Japan, as well as return trips to Europe and Australia, through 2007. Repossession Records closed its doors in January 2007, and the band plans on releasing all their upcoming new material directly through Psychodrama Music Group.\n\nSince the late 2000s, the band has been dormant, as the members have gone on to explore new ventures.\n\nAs of December 7th 2018, They have announced via Facebook that \"New music will be heard. Spread the word\" Also posting photos of possible studio time.\n\nIn January 2019, the band began posting teaser clips on social media of new music. In July 2019, the band announced their signing to eOne Music with their new single \"Vices\" being released on September 6.\n\nAs a bonus feature in the video game MLB Slugfest 2003, the band did a special recording and music video for the game. The original song is loosely based on the baseball classic Take Me Out to the Ball Game and is entitled \"Riot at the Bat Rack.\" \n\nDry Kill Logic's music has been categorized as nu metal, metalcore and thrash metal.

The tale the Canon's Yeoman tells is in two parts. The first part is an exposé of the shady business of his master the Canon as an alchemist. The second part is about another canon who is also an alchemist who is even more devious than the first.\n\nIt is not known if the introduction of these characters was an afterthought by Chaucer or if they were part of the design of the Tales from the start. It is believed it was one of the last tales to be written and it seems to many scholars such a lively attack on alchemists that Chaucer must have had a real person in mind. In 1374 a chaplain called William de Brumley confessed to making counterfeit gold coins after being taught by William Shuchirch. Shuchirch was a canon at King's Chapel, Windsor and in 1390 Chaucer supervised repairs of the chapel so he may have known Shuchirch.\n\nThere is no source for the tale although it has similarities to one by Ramon Llull. Chaucer probably got much of the technical detail from \"Speculum Naturale\" (Mirror of Nature) by Vincent of Beauvais and Arnold of Villanova is mentioned within the tale itself although he may have read many other alchemical texts. Chaucer's grasp of alchemy seems very accurate and in the 17th century the tale was cited by Elias Ashmole as proof that Chaucer was master of the science. Chaucer did have a great interest in science and technology, writing a Treatise on the Astrolabe.\n\nThe Yeoman seems much the more talkative of the two arrivals. When Harry Bailly, the host, asks the Canon for a tale, his yeoman chips in to announce how clever his master is, saying:\n\nThe host then asks why the Canon is dressed so poorly if he is so clever and the Yeoman admits that he may have wit but he misuses it. He then explains his master is an alchemist:\n\nThe Canon tries unsuccessfully to silence his Yeoman but ends up fleeing in shame; after which the Yeoman feels free to tell the history of the Canon. He describes how the Canon works to discover the philosopher's stone and many of the processes he goes through but how in the end the pot breaks and they lose most of the metal they had. He then continues with a story of a second canon who sells to a priest an alchemical 'crap' for producing silver after tricking him into believing that he can produce the metal spontaneously.\n\nAfter each of the tales the Yeoman adds a moral such as:\n\nHe also explains that we should not try to discover things keeps secret as it will not succeed and be like picking a fight with God. \n\nThe Canon Yeoman tells how he was once a happy man who wore fine clothing, but has now degraded into poverty - he must wear his stocking for a cap; he is so deep in debt that he can never repay loans no matter how long he lives or how \"talented\" he is; his face is grey and the colour of lead, implying that his pursuit of alchemy has left him suffering from lead poisoning and mortally ill.\nBen Jonson's play \"The Alchemist\" bears many similarities to Chaucer's tale. Chaucer has also described him as wearing green at all times.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2065219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065219", "title": "Our Lady of Mount Carmel", "text": "Our Lady of Mount Carmel\n\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel is the title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary in her role as patroness of the Carmelite Order. The first Carmelites were Christian hermits living on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land during the late 12th and early to mid-13th century. They built in the midst of their hermitages a chapel which they dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, whom they conceived of in chivalric terms as the \"Lady of the place.\" Our Lady of Mount Carmel was adopted in the 19th century as the patron saint of Chile, in South America.\n\nSince the 15th century, popular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel has centered on the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, also known as the Brown Scapular. Traditionally, Mary is said to have given the Scapular to an early Carmelite named Saint Simon Stock (1165-1265). The liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated on 16 July.\n\nThe solemn liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was probably first celebrated in England in the later part of the 14th century. Its object was thanksgiving to Mary, the patroness of the Carmelite Order, for the benefits she had accorded to it through its difficult early years. The institution of the feast may have come in the wake of the vindication of their title \"Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary\" at Cambridge, England, in 1374. The date chosen was 17 July; on the European mainland this date conflicted with the feast of St. Alexis, requiring a shift to 16 July, which remains the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel throughout the Catholic Church. The Latin poem \"\"Flos Carmeli\"\" (meaning \"Flower of Carmel\") first appears as the sequence for this Mass.\n\nThe Carmelite Order was the only religious order to be started in the Crusader States. In the 13th century, some of its people migrated west to England, setting up a chapter and being documented there about 1241–1242. A tradition first attested to in the late 14th century says that Saint Simon Stock, believed to be an early English prior general of the Carmelite Order soon after its migration to England, had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary in which she gave him the Brown Scapular. This formed part of the Carmelite habit after 1287. In Stock's vision, Mary promised that those who died wearing the scapular would be saved. This is a devotional sacramental signifying the wearer's consecration to Mary and affiliation with the Carmelite order. It symbolizes her special protection and calls the wearers to consecrate themselves to her in a special way.\n\nIn 1642, a Carmelite named Fr. John Cheron published a document which he said was a 13th-century letter written by Saint Simon Stock's secretary, Peter Swanington. Since the early 20th century, historians have concluded that this letter was forged, likely by Cheron himself.\n\nBut Stock's vision was long embraced by many promoters of the scapular devotion. The forged Swanington letter claimed that 16 July 1251 was the date of the vision (16 July being the date of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel), which led for centuries to a strong association between this feast day and the scapular devotion. Based on available historical documentation, the liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel did not originally have a specific association with the Brown Scapular or the tradition of Stock's vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This tradition grew gradually, as did the liturgical cult of St. Simon. The latter has been documented in Bordeaux, where Stock died, from the year 1435; in Ireland and England, from 1458; and in the rest of the Order, from 1564. Historians have long questioned whether Stock had the vision of Mary and the scapular. Although Simon Stock was never officially canonized, his feast day was celebrated in the church. The Carmelite convent of Aylesford, England, was restored and a relic of Saint Simon Stock was placed there in 1951. The saint's feast is celebrated in the places dedicated to him.\n\nAlso associated with Our Lady of Carmel was a papal bull saying that there was a \"Sabbatine privilege\" associated with devotion to the saint; that is, until the late 1970s, the Catholic liturgy for that day mentioned the scapular devotion. Vatican II resulted in scrutiny of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, as well as that of Saint Simon Stock, because of the historical uncertainties about the origins. The liturgies were revised and, in the 21st century, neither, even in the Carmelite proper, makes reference to the scapular.\nIn Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries, there has been particular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, who has been adopted as a patron saint of several places, as she has been in other Catholic-majority countries. In addition, Carmen and María del Carmen have been popular given names for girls in Spanish-speaking countries. An annual festival, known as \"Mamacha Carmen,\" is held in the highland Paucartambo District, Peru, featuring a procession with the Virgin and traditional dancers. Veneration of the Virgen del Carmen (often also associated with the Stella Maris) is particularly strong in coastal towns of Spain.\n\nThe Carmelites consider the Blessed Virgin Mary to be a perfect model of the interior life of prayer and contemplation to which Carmelites aspire, as well as a model of virtue, in the person who was closest in life to Jesus Christ. She is seen as the one who points Christians most surely to Christ. As she says to the servants at the wedding at Cana, \"Do whatever he [Jesus] tells you.\" Carmelites look to the Virgin Mary as a Spiritual Mother. The Stella Maris Monastery (Star of the Sea) on Mount Carmel, named after a traditional title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is considered the spiritual headquarters of the order.\n\nFr. Gabriel of St. Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi, OCD, a revered authority on Carmelite spirituality, wrote that devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel means:\nDevotees the Blessed Mother of Mount Carmel might raise petitions to her through the prayer: \nA 1996 doctrinal statement approved by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments states that \nDevotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel is bound to the history and spiritual values of the Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and is expressed through the scapular. Thus, whoever receives the scapular becomes a member of the order and pledges him/herself to live according to its spirituality in accordance with the characteristics of his/her state in life.\n\nDiscalced Carmelite Fr. Kieran Kavanaugh summarizes this spirituality: \nThe scapular is a Marian habit or garment. It is both a sign and pledge. A sign of belonging to Mary; a pledge of her motherly protection, not only in this life but after death. As a sign, it is a conventional sign signifying three elements strictly joined: first, belonging to a religious family particularly devoted to Mary, especially dear to Mary, the Carmelite Order; second, consecration to Mary, devotion to and trust in her Immaculate Heart; third, an urge to become like Mary by imitating her virtues, above all her humility, chastity, and spirit of prayer.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, Our Lady of Mount Carmel has been related to purgatory and purgation from sins after death. In some images, she is portrayed as accompanied with angels and persons wearing Brown Scapulars, who plead for her mediation. In 1613, the Church forbade images to be made of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel descending into purgatory, due to errors being preached about certain privileges associated with the Brown Scapular (known as \"the Sabbatine Privilege\").\n\nThat privilege appears in the noted Decree of the Holy Office (1613). It was inserted in its entirety (except for the words forbidding the painting of the pictures) into the list of the indulgences and privileges of the Confraternity of the Scapular of Mount Carmel. In the 21st century, the Carmelites do not promote the Sabbatine Privilege. They encourage a belief in Mary's general aid and prayerful assistance for persons beyond death, especially her aid to those who devoutly wear the Brown Scapular, and commend devotion to Mary especially on Saturdays, which are dedicated to her.\n\nThere is today a small sanctuary at Acquafondata, Italy, where the Virgin of Mount Carmel reportedly appeared on July 16, 1841. The visionaries of Our Lady of Fátima in 1917 reported Our Lady of Mount Carmel as among the titles claimed by Mary. She is said to have appeared to Saint Simon Stock to whom she gave the Brown Scapular. The Garabandal apparitions in Spain (1961–65) were reported to be images of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel. \n\nIn Palmi, Italy, the anniversary of the earthquake of 1894 is observed annually on 16 November. The earthquake had its epicenter in the city. An associated event has been classified as the \"miracle of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\" For 17 days preceding this earthquake, many of the faithful had reported strange eye movements and changes in the coloring of the face in a statue of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The local and national press reported these occurrences.\n\nIn the evening of 16 November, the faithful improvised a procession carrying the statue of the Virgin of Carmel on their shoulders through the streets. When the procession reached the end of the city, a violent earthquake shook the whole district of Palmi, ruining most of the old houses along the way. But, only nine people died out of a population of about 15,000 inhabitants, as almost all of the population had been on the street to watch the procession and were not trapped inside the destroyed buildings. Therefore, the city commemorates the 1894 procession each year, accompanied by firecrackers, lights, and festive stalls.\n\nThe Catholic Church has officially recognized the miracle.

The Catholic anti-war movement has built on the coincidence between this date and the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. In 1990 the Rev. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a priest of the Eastern Rite (Byzantine-Melkite) of the Catholic Church, initiated the \"16 July Twenty-Four Hours Day of Prayer,\" for Forgiveness and Protection with Our Lady of Mount Carmel, at Trinity Site in the New Mexico desert. Each year on 16 July, a prayer vigil is conducted at the Trinity site to pray for peace and the elimination of nuclear weapons.\n\nStatues of Our Lady of Mount Carmel usually depict her with a Brown scapular.\n\n"}

It was produced and distributed under Aishwarya's own Target Films banner and Tips Industries Limited. The film stars Arjun Rampal and Aishwarya Rai in the lead roles with Isha Koppikar, Raakhee, Paresh Rawal and Priyanshu Chatterjee in supporting roles. The music is composed by Nadeem Shravan and the lyrics are penned by Sameer. \n\nJai (Arjun Rampal) is a wealthy young man who supports many charities. One day, he accompanies his friend, Anita (Isha Koppikar) to a school for the deaf, which he is sponsoring. There, he meets Tia (Aishwarya Rai), a teacher, and develops feelings for her. He helps her wherever he can and tries to be near her — believing that Tia feels something for him too. Tia, on the other hand, views him simply as a good friend. When he finally admits his feelings, Tia reveals the existence of her fiancé, Raj (Priyanshu Chatterjee). Despite knowing of her engagement, Jai continues to pursue Tia since he cannot forget about her. Tia marries Raj and they have a son named Anshu. The trio lived a poor but happy life together. Jai is devastated, since several attempts to win over Tia's heart, fail.\n\nAfter a night out with friends, Jai becomes extremely drunk and drives home with Anita. He gets into a serious car accident, and it is revealed that Tia and Raj were in the other car. Anita and Raj die immediately at the scene. Tia herself survives but loses her memory.\n\nThe doctors believe that Tia will not be able to handle the mental anguish caused by the return of her memories and advise Tia's mother (Raakhee) to move her daughter to a place where nothing reminds her of her past. Jai wants to look after Tia since he is responsible for her condition and offers to take Tia and her mother to South Africa to live with him so that she can recuperate. Tia's mother accepts for Tia's sake, though she loathes Jai for killing her son-in-law and causing her daughter's memory loss. Tia is told that Anita was her best friend, who died in a car accident, and Anshu is Jai and Anita's son. Tia is told that Anshu loves his \"aunt\" very much and that she should look after the boy so he will not miss his mother too much.\n\nIn South Africa, Tia's mother realizes that Tia is developing feelings for Jai and warns him not to encourage her or reciprocate her feelings. Jai looks after Tia, but whenever she tries to get close to him, he keeps his distance. Jai's father (Paresh Rawal) tries to set them up to be together but Jai refuses — even though he still loves her very much. Finally, Tia's mother accepts the fact that her daughter is in love with Jai. However, Jai is still reluctant to enter a relationship with Tia since he feels guilty for causing the accident.\n\nTia confronts Jai about his attitude towards her, which leads to an altercation. Tia flees and Jai follows her. When she threatens to commit suicide, Jai is forced to admit that Anshu is Tia's son, Anita was only his friend, and that her husband died in the accident as well.\n\nJai's father, who arrives with Tia's mother, explains that Jai is very much in love with Tia, but he hopes that she regains her memory and punishes him for what he did: killing her husband in the car accident. However, Tia forgives Jai, even though she does not regain her memory, telling him that the accident was her destiny, and if he had not crashed into her, someone else would have. She says that since Jai does not want to be with her, she will take her son and leave. Jai stops her, saying that he wants to be a father figure to Anshu, tells her that he loves her and asks her to marry him, which she accepts happily.\n\n\nThe music is composed by Nadeem-Shravan with lyrics by Sameer. The music of this movie went on to become highly successful. Manish Dhamija of Planet Bollywood in his review gave the album 7 stars out of 10. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 14,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's one of the highest selling.\n"}

Located in the Palatinate region of the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the route was established in 1935.\n\nThe German Wine Gate (\"Deutsches Weintor\") in Schweigen-Rechtenbach on the French border adjacent to Wissembourg (Weißenburg) in France marks the start of the route. Built in 1936, the gate is an imposing ceremonial gatehouse made of sandstone.\n, the route traverses the Palatinate wine region (\"Pfalz\", formerly \"Rheinpfalz\") which lies in the lee of the Haardt Mountains, an area known as Anterior Palatinate (\"Vorderpfalz\").\n\nThe route runs northward, beside the path of Bundesstraßen B 38 and B 271 for 85 km, passing through towns like Bad Bergzabern, Edenkoben, Neustadt an der Weinstraße, Deidesheim, Bad Dürkheim and Grünstadt. It ends at the House of the German Wine Route in Bockenheim an der Weinstraße.\n\nThe route is marked by a yellow sign with a stylized bunch of ten grapes and the name of the route.\n\nThe region around the route has come to be known as the \"Weinstraße\" (Wine Route) region, and the administrative district (\"Kreis\") of Südliche Weinstraße (literally, \"Southern Wine Route\") takes its name from the route.\n\nThe German Wine Route was established in 1935. There was a record harvest in 1934, and another one was foreseen for 1935, so Gauleiter Josef Bürckel had the idea of establishing a road that connects all vintners' villages to boost the wine sales.\n\nThe German Wine Route was officially opened on 19 October 1935. Existing local roads along the route were renamed to incorporate \"\"Weinstraße\"\" into their names and local municipalities were told to add \"\"an der Weinstraße\"\" to their names.\n\nAfter World War 2, Nazi symbols were removed from the heraldic eagle on the south side of the German Wine Gate. Below, a US-Graffito from March 1945 honours Mineral Wells, Texas. \n\nWith a sunshine duration of over 1800 hours a year, the area around the German Wine Route is one of the warmest regions in Germany, allowing the cultivation of crops such as figs, lemons, and kiwifruit, which in Germany are only common here or in other parts of the upper Rhine valley, where the climate is similar.\n\nThe German Wine Route is also famous for its almond blossoms, painting the whole region in pink and white colours around the beginning of March.\n\nThe characteristic plant for this region is the vine, almost exclusively covering the landscape. Imported in Roman times, vines have ideal growing conditions: warm climate, minimum condensation due to the protective Palatinate Forest in the west, and attenuation of frost in the autumn due to the hillside location that benefits the outflow of cold air masses.\n\nThe German Wine Route is marked by numerous open-air wine festivals, held annually from March to October, that make it a major tourist attraction. The largest wine festival worldwide with more than 600,000 visitors each year is the \"Wurstmarkt\" in front of the world's largest wine barrel, the Giant Cask or \"Riesenfass\", in Bad Dürkheim in September. \n\nOther important wine festivals are the German Wine Harvesting Festival (\"Deutsches Weinlesefest\") in Neustadt an der Weinstraße where the German Wine Queen is selected in October, the festival in Freinsheim (\"Stadtmauerfest\" in July), and in Deidesheim (\"Deidesheimer Weinkerwe\" in August).\n\nThe first wine fest on the wine route is the \"Mandelblütenfest\" (Almond Blossom Festival) in Gimmeldingen held in March depending on the start of the flowering.\n\nOn the last Sunday in August, the route is closed to motorized traffic for German Wine Route Day (\"Erlebnistag Deutsche Weinstraße\") with many wineries and \"Straußwirtschaften\" open air (seasonal wine bars) open to the hundreds of thousands of hikers, cyclers and inline skaters who visit this festival.\n\nUnlike with festivals in other German wine regions, wine is served in 50 cl glasses rather than the typical 25 cl ones. They are of a special shape specific to the Palatinate wine region and are known as the \"Dubbeglas\", widening from bottom to top and featuring indentations or large dimples (\"Dubbe\") that give the glass its name. The dimples are especially useful when socializing starts and one's dexterity is affected by the wine. The undimpled half-litre \"Schoppenglas\" is also frequently seen along the route.\n\n\n"}

She was named for Samuel Chester Reid.\n\n\"Reid\" was laid down by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts, 9 September 1919; launched 15 October 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph W. Powell; and commissioned 3 December 1919, Lieutenant Commander V. D. Chapline in command.\n\nAssigned to Squadron 3, Atlantic Fleet, \"Reid\" completed shakedown off Cuba in February 1920; participated in battle practice in March; and on 26 April put into New York. Underway again on 1 May, she steamed south again, touched at Key West, then cruised off the east coast of Mexico until mid-June. By 6 July she was at Newport, Rhode Island, whence she made several runs to New York prior to shifting to Charleston, South Carolina toward the end of September. For almost 3 years she remained on the east coast, operating out of Charleston, Newport, Rhode Island and Yorktown, Virginia. Such coastal operations were occasionally interrupted for brief periods of inactivity at Charleston, due to cuts in personnel.\n\nIn late January 1923 \"Reid\" returned to Guantanamo Bay for winter maneuvers, and in February she continued on to the Panama Canal Zone for battle practice. By the end of March she was back off Cuba, from where she returned to Newport and exercises off the east coast. In the winter of 1924, she repeated her Caribbean operations; but, in the spring, headed east for duty in European waters.\n\nOn 28 June she arrived at Cherbourg, France, and on 1 July joined the Light Cruiser Squadron. During that month she visited various Baltic and North Sea ports. In mid-August she conducted airplane patrols off Iceland, and in September she steamed into the Mediterranean. She remained in the western Mediterranean into November, and then proceeded, via Crete and Greece, to Turkey. During the next 2 months, she patrolled the eastern basin, calling at ports in the Levant and Egypt, and, in February 1925, resumed operations off France and Tunisia.\n\n\"Reid\" departed the Mediterranean in early May, and, after calls at French and British ports, crossed the Atlantic, arriving at New York 16 July. By the end of August she had resumed operations out of Newport and in September she again steamed south for exercises in the Caribbean. In December she underwent overhaul at Philadelphia, then returned to the Caribbean.\n\nAttached to the Scouting Fleet for the next 4 years, she continued to alternate east coast training cruises with Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico operations. From 24 April to 12 June 1927, she participated in the second Nicaraguan campaign - cruising off that coast, delivering supplies and mail to Marine detachments ashore, and assisting in the collecting of arms from allied forces.\n\nIn 1929 \"Reid\" was designated for inactivation. She completed her last cruise at Philadelphia 30 August 1929 and was decommissioned there 1 May 1930. Struck from the Navy list 22 October 1930, she was sold for scrapping to the Boston Iron & Metal Company, Baltimore, Maryland, 17 January 1931.\n\nSee for other ships of this name.\n\n"}

SPHE also releases and distributes products from Revolution Studios and The Criterion Collection. Since June 20, 2007, SPHE has handled distribution of children's content formerly handled by Sony BMG's Sony Wonder label.\n\nSPHE is also responsible for distribution of television shows from the Sony Pictures Television library, including those produced by , Columbia Pictures Television, TriStar Television, Tandem Productions, TOY Productions, ELP Communications (shows include from T.A.T.

It also has an Australian deal with Hoyts.\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment was established in June 1978 as Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment, and released 20 titles in November 1979.\n\nIn March 1981, Columbia Pictures established a joint venture with RCA, RCA/Columbia Pictures International Video, to distribute tapes in overseas markets. The partnership expanded to North America as RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video the following year. The venture distributed NBC titles, as it was a subsidiary of RCA at the time. When Tri-Star Pictures was formed in 1984, R/CPHV became one of the three primary distributors of Tri-Star product for home video (the other two being CBS/Fox Video and Thorn-EMI/HBO Video {later renamed to HBO/Cannon Video and then simply HBO Video}, as CBS and HBO originally held stakes in Tri-Star), and fully assumed distribution of TriStar titles in the early 1990s. They also distributed titles from various other film companies unrelated to Columbia, including most of New Line Cinema's theatrical releases (though not all, as Media Home Entertainment and Family Home Entertainment distributed several NLC films during the Columbia deal). New Line formed their own video label in 1990 (the result of acquiring Nelson Entertainment, which had previously been Embassy Home Entertainment, ironic considering EHE had been owned by Columbia for a brief period of time before being spun off), but continued to go through RCA/Columbia Pictures (as well as SVS-Triumph and then Columbia TriStar Home Video) for distribution until 1994, when Turner Broadcasting acquired NLC and Turner Home Entertainment assumed distribution functions.\n\nIn March 1990, NBC filed a lawsuit against Columbia and its then-new parent company Sony under the perception that the latter two parties were violating their joint pact. Columbia purchased the foreign video rights to Orion Pictures titles a month earlier. NBC alleged that they were unaware of this transaction and had become convinced that Columbia was forming their own video unit in strict defiance of the joint venture, which was set to expire in 1992. Sony/Columbia denied NBC's claims. As the lawsuit continued into 1991, General Electric, the parent of NBC and RCA, announced that it was divesting its interest in RCA/Columbia. In August 1991, General Electric sold its 50% share of the company to Sony Corporation, and the litigation officially ended with Sony renaming the company as Columbia TriStar Home Video.

{"id": "2065248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065248", "title": "Perdurantism", "text": "Perdurantism\n\nPerdurantism or perdurance theory is a philosophical theory of persistence and identity. The perdurantist view is that an individual has distinct temporal parts throughout its existence. Perdurantism is usually presented as the antipode to endurantism, the view that an individual is wholly present at every moment of its existence.\n\nThe use of \"endure\" and \"perdure\" to distinguish two ways in which an object can be thought to persist can be traced to David Kellogg Lewis (1986). However, contemporary debate has demonstrated the difficulties in defining perdurantism (and also endurantism). For instance, the work of Ted Sider (2001) has suggested that even enduring objects can have temporal parts, and it is more accurate to define perdurantism as being the claim that objects have a temporal part at every instant that they exist. Currently there is no universally acknowledged definition of perdurantism. Others argue that this problem is avoided by creating time as a continuous function, rather than a discrete one.\n\nPerdurantism is also referred to as \"four-dimensionalism\" (by Ted Sider, in particular) but perdurantism also applies if one believes there are temporal but non-spatial abstract entities (like immaterial souls or universals of the sort accepted by David Malet Armstrong).\n\nPerdurantists break into two distinct sub-groups: worm theorists and stage theorists.\n\nWorm theorists believe that a persisting object is composed of the various temporal parts that it has. It can be said that objects that persist are extended through the time dimension of the block universe much as physical objects are extended in space. Thus, they believe that all persisting objects are four-dimensional \"worms\" that stretch across space-time, and that you are mistaken in believing that chairs, mountains, and people are simply three-dimensional.\n\nStage theorists take discussion of persisting objects to be talk of a particular temporal part, or stage, of an object at any given time. So, in a manner of speaking, a subject only exists for an instantaneous period of time. However, there are other temporal parts at other times which that subject is related to in a certain way (Sider talks of \"modal counterpart relations\", whilst Hawley talks of \"non-Humean relations\") such that when someone says that they were a child, or that they will be an elderly person, these things are true, because they bear a special \"identity-like\" relation to a temporal part that is a child (that exists in the past) or a temporal part that is an elderly person (that exists in the future). Stage theorists are sometimes called \"exdurantists\".\n\nIt has been argued that stage theory, unlike the worm theory, should be favored as it accurately accounts for the contents of our experience. The latter requires that we currently experience more than a single moment of our lives while we actually find ourselves experiencing only one instant of time, in line with the stage view. However, on the other hand, as Stuchlik (2003) states, the stage theory will not work under the possibility of gunky time, which states that for every interval of time, there is a sub-interval, and according to Zimmerman (1996), there have been many self-professed perdurantists who believe that time is gunky or contains no instants. Some perdurantists think the idea of gunk means there are no instants, since they define these as intervals of time with no subintervals.\n\n\n\n"}

Daniels left the writing staff in 1990.\n\nDaniels joined the writing staff of \"The Simpsons\" in 1993. He was hired in the fifth season following the departures of many of the original team of writers. His first day also coincided with O'Brien's last day on the series.\n\nWhen he initially joined the series, he believed the series had gone past the \"glory years\" and that he had \"missed the boat.\" In the fifth season, Daniels penned \"Homer and Apu\", \"Secrets of a Successful Marriage\", and \"The Devil and Homer Simpson\" segment of \"Treehouse of Horror IV\".\n\nDaniels received an Emmy nomination in the \"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics\" category for the song \"Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart?\" from \"Homer and Apu\". For season six, he wrote \"Homer Badman\", \"Lisa's Wedding\", and the \"Time and Punishment\" segment from \"Treehouse of Horror V\". The latter episode became the third of the series to win a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. In the seventh season, Daniels wrote \"Bart Sells His Soul,\" which was based on a childhood experience. His final credit for the series was for \"22 Short Films About Springfield\", which he served as supervising writer alongside show runner Josh Weinstein. They were given the responsibility of linking all the stories together.\n\nDaniels left \"The Simpsons\" to work on \"King of the Hill\" alongside Mike Judge. Daniels rewrote the pilot script and created several important characters that did not appear in Judge's first draft (including Luanne and Cotton), as well as some characterization ideas (e.g., making Dale Gribble a conspiracy theorist).\n\nDaniels also took the writers to Texas to do some research with reporter notebooks, a process he would use for \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Recreation\". Judge was ultimately so pleased with Daniels' contributions that he chose to credit him as a co-creator, rather than give him the \"developer\" credit usually reserved for individuals brought on to a pilot written by someone else. During the fifth and sixth seasons, Judge and Daniels became less involved with the show. They eventually focused on the show again, although Daniels steadily became more involved with other projects.\n\nIn 2005, Daniels adapted the popular BBC mockumentary series \"The Office\" for American audiences. The series premiered to mixed reviews, so the writers worked to make it more \"optimistic\" and make the lead character, Michael Scott, more likable. The second season was better received and it was named the second best TV series of 2006 by James Poniewozik, writing that \"Producer Greg Daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly American work conventions [...] with a tone that's more satiric and less mordant. [...] The new boss is different from the old boss, and that's fine by me.\" He gave the acceptance speech at the 58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards when the American version of \"The Office\" won the award for Outstanding Comedy Series, and he received an award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series at the 59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nFollowing the success of \"The Office\", Ben Silverman asked Daniels to create a spin-off for the series. After considering several ideas, Daniels and co-creator Michael Schur eventually decided that the series would not get a spin-off because Daniels and Schur \"couldn't find the right fit.\" After Amy Poehler agreed to play the lead, they decided their new series would revolve around an optimistic female bureaucrat in small-town government. The premise of \"Parks and Recreation\" was partly inspired by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series \"The Wire\", as well as the renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The series initially received mixed reviews, much like \"The Office\" in the first season, but after a re-approach to its format and tone, the later seasons received critical acclaim. For four years, he split his time between \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Rec\", before eventually returning as full-time showrunner for \"The Office\" for its ninth and final season.\n\nIn 2011, Daniels made a deal with NBC to produce several series for Universal Television. He also developed the British series \"Friday Night Dinner\" for American audiences. The remake was picked up for a pilot, which was written by Daniels and directed by Ken Kwapis, and featured Allison Janney and Tony Shalhoub as the mother and father. The pilot was eventually not picked up for series. He also teamed with Mindy Kaling and Alan Yang to work on two different animated series for NBC and made a deal to executive produce a new pilot written by \"The Office\" writer Owen Ellickson and starring \"The Office\" cast member Craig Robinson. He served as director and executive producer on the TBS series \"People of Earth\". In January 2019, Netflix announced that he would write and produce a new series called \"Space Force\" starring Steve Carell, who was the lead in Daniels' previous sitcom \"The Office\". He created the Amazon original sci-fi series \"Upload\" which started streaming in May 2020.\n\nDaniels met Susanne Dari Lieberstein while she was answering phones at \"Saturday Night Live\" for Lorne Michaels. They eventually married and had four children: Maya, Charlotte, Haley, and Owen. She is the sister of Paul Lieberstein, writer for \"King of the Hill\" and the replacement showrunner of \"The Office\" for Daniels. He was also the brother-in-law to \"The Office\" cast member Angela Kinsey until her divorce from \"The Office\" writer Warren Lieberstein in 2010.\n\nDaniels' work has received mainly positive reception. Out of the six TV series that Daniels has worked on, four of them—\"Saturday Night Live\", \"The Simpsons\", \"King of the Hill\" and \"The Office\"—were named among \"Time\" reviewer James Poniewozik's All Time 100 TV Shows. His work on \"The Simpsons\" has received acclaim from critics and fans. Two of his episodes, \"Bart Sells His Soul\" and \"22 Short Films About Springfield,\" were listed among the show's creative team's top five favorite episodes in 2003. Series creator Matt Groening and executive producer James L. Brooks have named his episodes among their favorites. Other staff members and several critics have praised his work. His other animated series and his first credit as a creator, \"King of the Hill,\" has received positive reviews as well. IGN named it the 27th best animated television series, and the site mainly complimented the series for its subtle character humor. \nHis next television series, \"The Office,\" ranked as NBC's highest rated show for a majority of its run, according to the Nielsen ratings. The series has also been put on several top series lists by many publications including \"Time\", BuddyTV, Metacritic, \"The Washington Post\", and \"Paste\". His writing credits for the series are often considered the best of the series. Despite its early acclaim, later seasons have received criticism for a dip in quality, notably after Daniels was less involved. Daniels' next series, \"Parks and Recreation,\" has been called \"the smartest comedy on TV\" by \"Entertainment Weekly\".\n\nDaniels has received several awards and nominations. He has been nominated for twenty Emmys and has won four. Those wins are for: Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program for his work on \"Saturday Night Live\", Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program for the Simpsons episode, \"Lisa's Wedding,\" Outstanding Comedy Series for \"The Office\" and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for \"The Office: Gay Witch Hunt\". Daniels was also awarded Austin Film Festival's Outstanding Television Writer Award in 2008.\n"}

It has been operating since 1955. In 2017, the airport has served more than 15 million passengers in total, 13 million of which were domestic passengers. It ranked 4th in terms of total passenger traffic (after Ataturk Airport, Antalya Airport and Sabiha Gökçen Airport), 3rd in terms of domestic passenger traffic (after Ataturk Airport and Sabiha Gökçen Airport) among airports in Turkey.\n\nThe airport is located northeast of Ankara, from the city center. The airport is connected with Kızılay (the city center) and Ankara Intercity Bus Terminal (Turkish: Ankara Şehirlerarası Terminal İşletmesi, AŞTİ) by EGO city bus number 442 (from 6 am to 11pm). Transportation to the city center is also by taxi (around TRY 90 one way, metered) and through the Havaş bus line (approximately TRY 12,5 one way). The road between Esenboğa airport and the Ankara ring road was expanded during the summer of 2006, decreasing the driving time between the city center and the airport by several minutes.\n\nThe name of the airport comes from the village of Esenboğa (the ğ is silent), which literally means \"Windflowing Bull\" or \"Serene Bull\", the modernized form of Isen Buqa, the name of a Turkic warlord in the army of Timur who settled his troops here during the Battle of Ankara in 1402.\n\nEsenboğa International Airport was awarded as the best airport in Europe by ACI Europe (Airport Council International) and the award presented to airport officials on 17 June 2009 in Manchester. The award is given in 4 categories every year and Esenboğa was in 5–10 million per annum category. It is the first time an ACI award was granted to a Turkish Airport. According to ACI-Europe, \"As with number of the top candidates in this category, the airport excels in all the keys areas of operations, however the judges singled it out for its work in the area of environmental innovation, securing an incredible 25% energy savings stemming from its recycling of exhaust gases to power its air conditioning plants.\" In 2020, Esenboğa Airport was awarded as the best European airport with a capacity of 15 – 25 million passengers by Airports Council International.\n\nA new parallel runway is under construction to the east of the terminal building. Upon the completion, the current runway 03R/21L will be resigned as 03C/21C and the new runway will receive the latter's former designation.\n\nEsenboga Airport Domestic and International Terminal constructed under \"Build-Operate-Transfer\" model has been completed within a record time; a year earlier than the committed completion date. Esenboga Airport Domestic and International Terminal, which went into operation on October 16, 2006 with a capacity of 10 million passengers, are spread over a 182 thousand m2 area.

{"id": "2065316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065316", "title": "Lettres provinciales", "text": "Lettres provinciales\n\nThe Lettres provinciales (Provincial letters) are a series of eighteen letters written by French philosopher and theologian Blaise Pascal under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte. Written in the midst of the formulary controversy between the Jansenists and the Jesuits, they are a defense of the Jansenist Antoine Arnauld from Port-Royal-des-Champs, a friend of Pascal who in 1656 was condemned by the Faculté de Théologie at the Sorbonne in Paris for views that were claimed to be heretical. The First letter is dated January 23, 1656 and the Eighteenth March 24, 1657. A fragmentary Nineteenth letter is frequently included with the other eighteen.\n\nIn these letters, Pascal humorously attacked casuistry, a rhetorical method often used by Jesuit theologians, and accused Jesuits of moral laxity. Being quickly forced underground while writing the \"Provincial Letters\", Pascal pretended they were reports from a Parisian to a friend in the provinces, on the moral and theological issues then exciting the intellectual and religious circles in the capital. In the letters, Pascal's tone combines the fervor of a convert with the wit and polish of a man of the world. Their style meant that, quite apart from their religious influence, the \"Provincial Letters\" were popular as a literary work. Adding to that popularity was Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and satire in his arguments. The letters also influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Brilliantly written by Pascal, the \"Provincial Letters\" would not have been possible without the work of theologians from Port-Royal; indeed, most of the arguments Pascal deployed were already to be found in Arnauld's \"Théologie morale des Jésuites\", something which led the Jesuit Nicolas Caussin to reply to Pascal's perceived libel. Pascal's main source on Jesuit casuistry was Antonio Escobar's \"Summula casuum conscientiae\" (1627), several propositions of which would be later condemned by Pope Innocent XI.\n\nParadoxically, the \"Provincial Letters\" were both a success and a defeat: a defeat, on the political and theological level, and a success on the moral level. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied the Pope himself, provoking Alexander VII to condemn the letters. But that didn't stop most of educated France from reading them. Moreover, even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments. Just a few years later (1665–66, and then 1679), Alexander condemned \"laxity\" in the church and ordered a revision of casuistical texts.\n\nStructurally, the first three letters ridicule the dispute between the Thomists and the Jesuits on the nature of salvation, rather asserting a Jansenist understanding of salvation. Making allusion to the Congregatio de Auxiliis, the debate concerned the respective role of grace and free will, Molinists (i.e. Jesuits) claiming that an \"efficacious grace\" was not necessary to save man, but only a \"sufficient grace\" bestowed by God to all men, while Thomists claimed that the \"sufficient grace,\" given to all men, had to be assisted by an \"efficacious grace,\" bestowed only to the select few (in accordance also with Augustinism). Pascal thus highlighted, in the Second Letter, that neo-Thomists and Jesuits were using the same term, \"sufficient grace\", with two different senses, for political reasons.\n\nThe Fourth Letter deals with the question of \"actual grace,\" the Jesuits claiming that sin could only be committed if people had knowledge of the evil inherent to the planned action. The Jesuit priest with whom Pascal was speaking quoted Le Moyne, a professor to the Sorbonne from 1642 to 1654 — Le Moyne's definition had already been used by Arnauld in the \"Apologie pour les saints Pères\":\n“1. On the one hand, God sheds abroad on the soul some measure of love, which gives it a bias toward the thing commanded; and on the other, a rebellious concupiscence solicits it in the opposite direction. 2. God inspires the soul with a knowledge of its own weakness. 3. God reveals the knowledge of the physician who can heal it. 4. God inspires it with a desire to be healed. 5. God inspires a desire to pray and solicit his assistance.”\n\n“And unless all these things occur and pass through the soul,” added the (Jesuit) monk, “the action is not properly a sin, and cannot be imputed, as M. le Moine shows in the same place and in what follows.\n\nPascal replied, that this meant that all those whose \"vices have got the better of their reason\" and who indulge in \"perpetual round of all sorts of pleasures\", so long as they are ignorant of the immorality of their actions, were excused by this doctrine. While he argued, citing the Bible, that those who did believe in God but were deprived of knowledge of their evil actions (and thus deprived, for a moment, of the Jesuits' \"actual grace\") were still sinners.\n\nFurthermore, Pascal ridiculed the attempt of Etienne Bauny, author of a \"Somme des péchés qui se commettent en tous états\" (Paris, 1634), to use Aristotle to justify this doctrine of sin (which could, according to Bauny, only be effective if man possessed the knowledge of the action). Bauny thus quoted the \"Nicomachean Ethics\", III, 1, alleging that a voluntary action needed knowledge of what was good or evil in it. Pascal replied, also quoting Aristotle (he seemingly was the only one to use this argument in this debate), that Aristotle spoke only of knowledge of the actual circumstances of the act, but not at all of the capacity to discriminate between good and evil — since Aristotle stated that one who was devoided of that capacity was not excused at all, but rather considered a vicious man.\n\nThe rest of the letters are mainly an attack on Jesuit casuistry. The Fifth letter, published in a hurry after a police search in Jansenist-friendly publishing houses, is particularly dedicated to criticisms against the Jesuits' doctrine of moral probabilism, according to which one could adopt a \"probable opinion,\" that is, an opinion made plausible by the authority of a theologian, even if it was less probable than another opinion — especially concerning what conduct ought to be followed, the nature of sins, etc. Pascal relied heavily on this witty attack, composed of quotes from various books written by Jesuit casuists, in particular by Antonio Escobar y Mendoza's \"Summula casuum conscientiae\" (1627), which had enjoyed a great success, and also Thomas Sanchez, Vincenzo Filliucci (Jesuit and penitentiary at St Peter's), Antonino Diana, Paul Laymann, Etienne Bauny, Louis Cellot, Valerius Reginaldus, Bernard Lamy (censored on 8 October 1649 by the Faculty of Leuven for his defense of homicide), etc.\n\nIn this letter, he evoked in passing the Chinese Rites controversy which ended with the Jesuits' condemnation and the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide's decision to prohibit idolatry under any pretexts. He also alluded to the problem of the relations between Christian virtues and natural virtues, debated in particular during the first half of the 17th century. After Jean-Pierre Camus and Arnauld, Pascal attacked the Jesuit Antoine Sirmond, who had practically admitted the identity between natural virtues and Christian virtues.\n\nStarting at Letter VI, dated 10 April 1656, Pascal gives a number of examples of Jesuit casuistry and of its \"relaxed morality,\" citing abundant sources (many of which came from Escobar). He illustrated casuistry by citing mostly Jesuitic texts allowing excuses to abstain from fasting (citing Vincenzo Filliucci's \"Moralium quaestionum de christianis officiis et casibus conscientiae... tomus\", Lyon, 1622; often cited by Escobar); from giving to the poor (indirectly citing Gabriel Vasquez from Diana; for a monk temporarily defrocking himself to go to the brothel (citing an exact quote of Sanchez from Escobar, who was evading Pius IV's \"Contra sollicitantes\" and Pius V's \"Contra clericos\" papal bulls, the latter directed against sodomite clergy)); in the Seventh Letter, propositions allowing homicides (even to the clergy) and duels as long as the intention is not directed for revenge; others permitting corruption of judges as long as it is not intended as corruption; others allowing usury or Mohatra contracts; casuistic propositions allowing robbery and stealing from one's master; others allowing lying through the use of rhetorical \"mental reservation\" (\"restrictio mentalis\"; for instance: saying, loudly \"I swear that...\", silently \"I said that...\", and loudly again the object of the pledge) and equivocations. A number of these scandalous propositions were later condemned by Pope Innocent XI.\n\nIn the Ninth Letter, the Jesuit explains to the narrator easy ways to enter Heaven, citing a book called \"“Paradise opened to Philagio, in a Hundred Devotions to the Mother of God, easily practiced.”\" The Tenth Letter is dedicated to casuistic procedures to lighten the ritual of confession and to the debate between the respective roles of attrition and contrition; the Jesuit character claiming that sole attrition combined with the sacrament of penance is sufficient for man's salvation, while the narrator insists on the necessity of contrition and of the love of God, citing extracts of the Bible often quoted by the Jansenists, the abbé de Saint-Cyran and Jansenius.\n\nThe Thirteenth and Fourteenth Letter s criticize the Jesuits' legitimation of homicide. In the latter, Pascal abstains himself from discussing the most scandalous Jesuit propositions, legitimizing tyrannicides and abortions. He quotes, among others, the Church's policies of penance for sinners guilty of willful murder officialized during the Synod of Ancyra (341).\n\nIn the Seventeenth Letter, Pascal took again the problem of the efficacious grace and of the \"de facto vs de juris\" debate concerning the inclusion, or not, of the 5 Propositions condemned by the Pope in the \"Cum Occasione\" papal bull, in Jansenius's work (see Formulary controversy for details). Port-Royal and Pascal argued that although the Pope had condemned these 5 Propositions as heretical, they were not to be found in Jansenius. Furthermore, they claimed that the Pope held authority only on matters of faith, and not on technical \"de facto\" matters. Thus, drawing on the Jesuits' argumentation itself, Pascal argued here that one could not be held heretical to believe that Jansenius' work did not include these 5 Propositions, and that the Papal condemnation only restricted itself to the heresy itself, not to the question of their inclusion in Jansenius' work. Thus, he recalled the Jesuit Cardinal Bellarmin's sentences concerning the authority of religious councils concerning matters of dogma versus \"de facto\" issues; he also recalled the debate between St Athanasius and St Basil concerning the interpretation of Dionysus of Alexandria, who was accused by Basil of Arianism and therefore convoked before the Pope Dionysius in 262; or the various contradictory papal interpretations given to the Scythian monks; as well as another debate concerning Pope Honorius I, who had been later anathematized by the Third Council of Constantinople, although Cardinal Bellarmin defended Honorius' orthodoxy, claiming that the condemned propositions were not to be found in Honorius.\n\nThe reaction to the \"Lettres provinciales\" was substantial. Pascal's use of wit, humor, and mockery in attacking existing institutions made his work extremely popular. However, its publication was primarily via the underground press, and in 1660 Louis XIV banned the book and ordered it shredded and burned. Pascal himself had to enter clandestinity, living in cheap hostels. Nevertheless, the letters survived and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The extract of the Seventh Letter concerning the \"direction of intention\" influenced Molière's \"Tartuffe\" (Act IV, scene V, 1489–1493).\n\nThey were first translated into Latin by Antoine Arnauld, and then into many other languages, including English in 1657 (\"Les Provinciales, or the Mystery of Jesuitisme, discovered in certain letters written upon occasion of the present differences at Sorbonne between the jansenists and the molinists\", London, Royston, 1657) by the Anglican theologian Henry Hammond, while in 1684 a polyglot translation (in French, Latin, Spanish and Italian) was published by Balthasar Winfelt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jack stated in his \"Bakerganj Gazetier\" that the island started creating in 1235 and cultivation in this area started in 1300. In 1500, Portuguese and Mog pirates established their bases in this island. The Arakan and Mog pirates established their bases in the southern part of Shahbajpur also.\n\nShahbajpur was a part of Bakerganj district till 1822. At the beginning of 19th century, it became difficult to connect to the southern Shahjadpur from the district headquarter due to the expansion of Meghna River. Government then decided to include south Shahbajpur and Hatia in Noakhali District. Bhola was included in Noakhali till 1869. In 1869, it was included in Barisal District as a sub-division. In 1876, the administrative headquarter was moved from Daulatkhan to Bhola. In 1984, it was established as a district.\n\nThe canal situated in the Bhola Sadar was very wide in ancient times. The canal was known as Betua river. People used boat to cross the river. There was a very old boatman who used to cross the river daily. His name was Bhola Gazi Patni. The name of the district is derived from the name of this famous boatman, Bhola Gazi. The other sub-districts of this districts are also named according to the names of famous persons as well.\n\nBhola is a delta island.

He is currently a professor of biology, and professor of neurology and neurological sciences and, by courtesy, neurosurgery, at Stanford University. In addition, he is a research associate at the National Museums of Kenya.\n\nSapolsky was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrants from the Soviet Union. His father, Thomas Sapolsky, was an architect who renovated the restaurants Lüchow's and Lundy's. Robert was raised an Orthodox Jew and spent his time reading about and imagining living with silverback gorillas. By age 12, he was writing fan letters to primatologists. He attended John Dewey High School and, by that time, he was reading textbooks on the subject and teaching himself Swahili.\n\nSapolsky describes himself as an atheist. He stated in his acceptance speech for the Emperor Has No Clothes Award, \"I was raised in an Orthodox [Jewish] household, and I was raised devoutly religious up until around age 13 or so. In my adolescent years, one of the defining actions in my life was breaking away from all religious belief whatsoever.\"\n\nIn 1978, Sapolsky received his B.A. in biological anthropology \"summa cum laude\" from Harvard University. He then went to Kenya to study the social behaviors of baboons in the wild. When the Uganda–Tanzania War broke out in the neighboring countries, Sapolsky decided to travel into Uganda to witness the war up close, later commenting that \"I was twenty-one and wanted adventure. [...] I was behaving like a late-adolescent male primate.\" He went to Uganda's capital Kampala, and from there to the border with Zaire, and then back to Kampala, witnessing some fighting, including the Ugandan capital's conquest by the Tanzanian army and its Ugandan rebel allies on 10–11 April 1979. Sapolsky then returned to New York and studied at Rockefeller University, where he received his Ph.D. in neuroendocrinology working in the lab of endocrinologist Bruce McEwen.\n\nAfter the initial year-and-a-half field study in Africa, he would return every summer for another twenty-five years to observe the same group of baboons, from the late 70s to the early 90s. He spent 8 to 10 hours a day for approximately four months each year recording the behaviors of these primates.\n\nSapolsky is currently the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, holding joint appointments in several departments, including Biological Sciences, Neurology & Neurological Sciences, and Neurosurgery.\n\nAs a neuroendocrinologist, he has focused his research on issues of stress and neuronal degeneration, as well as on the possibilities of gene therapy strategies for protecting susceptible neurons from disease. Currently, he is working on gene transfer techniques to strengthen neurons against the disabling effects of glucocorticoids. Each year, Sapolsky spends time in Kenya studying a population of wild baboons in order to identify the sources of stress in their environment, and the relationship between personality and patterns of stress-related disease in these animals. More specifically, Sapolsky studies the cortisol levels between the alpha male and female and the subordinates to determine stress level. An early but still relevant example of his studies of olive baboons is to be found in his 1990 \"Scientific American\" article, \"Stress in the Wild\". He has also written about neurological impairment and the insanity defense within the American legal system.\n\nSapolsky's work has been featured widely in the press, most notably in the National Geographic documentary \"Stress: Portrait of a Killer\", articles in \"The New York Times\", \"Wired\" magazine and the Stanford magazine. His speaking style (e.g., on Radiolab, \"The Joe Rogan Experience\", and his Stanford human behavioural biology lectures) has garnered attention, and even adulation, for otherwise abstruse topics. Sapolsky's specialization in primatology and neuroscience has made him prominent in the public discussion of mental health—and, more broadly, human relationships—from an evolutionary context.\n\nSapolsky has received numerous honors and awards for his work, including the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship Genius Grant in 1987, an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and the Klingenstein Fellowship in Neuroscience. He was also awarded the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, the Young Investigator of the Year Awards from the Society for Neuroscience, the International Society for Psychoneuroendocrinology, and the Biological Psychiatry Society.\n\nIn 2007 he received the John P. McGovern Award for Behavioral Science, awarded by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nIn 2008 he received Wonderfest's Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization.\nIn February 2010 Sapolsky was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers, following the earlier Emperor Has No Clothes Award for year 2002.\n\nSapolsky is married to Lisa Sapolsky, a doctor in neuropsychology.

He left home when he was 15 and played with Milt Shaw's Detroiters and the Smith Ballew and Duncan-Marin bands. His first substantial professional engagement came in 1934 with the Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra. It was with the Smith Ballew band in 1929 that McKinley met Glenn Miller. The two formed a friendship that lasted from 1929 until Miller's death in 1944. McKinley and Miller joined the Dorsey Brothers in 1934. Miller left for Ray Noble in December 1934, while McKinley remained.\n\nThe Dorsey brothers split in 1935, with McKinley remaining with Jimmy Dorsey until 1939, when he joined Will Bradley, becoming co-leader. McKinley's biggest hit with Bradley, as a singer, was \"Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar\", which he recorded early in the year 1940 (and for which he got partial songwriting credit under his wife's maiden name Eleanore Sheehy). McKinley is referred to as \"Eight Beat Mack\" in the lyrics to the song \"Down the Road a Piece,\" which he recorded as a trio with Will Bradley and Freddie Slack in 1940. This was the earliest recording of the song, which was written specifically for Bradley's band by Don Raye.\n\nMcKinley and Bradley split in 1942 and McKinley formed his own band, which recorded for Capitol Records. The McKinley band was short-lived. When McKinley broke up the band, he joined Glenn Miller's , which he co-led with arranger Jerry Gray after Miller's disappearance in December 1944. Upon being discharged at the end of the following year, McKinley formed a modern big band that featured a book of original material by legendary arranger Eddie Sauter (along with a helping of novelty vocals by the leader). Sam Butera, later of the back-up band for Louis Prima was also a member. But with the business in decline, by 1950 that band was history and McKinley began evolving into a part-time leader and sometime radio and TV personality.\n\nIn 1956, capitalizing on the popularity of \"The Glenn Miller Story\" movie with James Stewart, McKinley was chosen to be the leader of the revived Glenn Miller Orchestra that still exists as of 2019, which he led until 1966. He co-hosted, with former Air Force band vocalist Johnny Desmond, a 13-week CBS-TV summer replacement series with the band called \"Glenn Miller Time\" in 1961.\n\nRay McKinley's last recording session was in 1977 for Chiaroscuro Records.\n\nRay McKinley wrote the lyrics to the 1945 wartime song \"My Guy's Come Back\" with music by Mel Powell. The song was recorded by Benny Goodman with vocals by Liza Morrow and was released as a Columbia Records 78 single in 1945 as a V-Disc in February, 1946 as No. 585A. He composed the songs \"Jiminy Crickets\", \"Bahama Mama\", and \"Hoodle Addle\" in 1947. He wrote \"Old Doc Yak\" with Freddie Slack.

Despite the deaths of her sister, Princess Margaret, and mother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in February and March 2002 respectively, and predictions in the media that the anniversary would be a non-event, the jubilee was marked with large-scale and popular events throughout London in June of the same year, bookended by events throughout the Commonwealth realms. Elizabeth attended all of the official celebrations as scheduled, along with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh; over twelve months, the royal couple journeyed more than to the Caribbean, Australia, New Zealand, then around the United Kingdom, and wrapped up the jubilee year in Canada. Numerous landmarks, parks, buildings, and the like, were also named in honour of the golden jubilee and commemorative medals, stamps, and other symbols were issued.\n\nAustralian celebrations were markedly on a smaller scale than the 1977 Silver Jubilee event. Unlike in 1977 when Silver Jubilee Medals were issued in Australia, no medal was issued for the Golden Jubilee, this contrasted with the United Kingdom and Canada, both issuing medals on a wide basis. Queen Elizabeth was on 27 February received in Adelaide by the Governor-General, Peter Hollingworth; the Australian viceroy, at the time, was in the midst of controversy involving allegations of child abuse cover-ups in the Anglican Church and demonstrators were present when the Queen and Prince Philip landed. The royal couple undertook a five-day tour through South Australia and Queensland, which also coincided with that year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Coolum Beach. On the Queen's Birthday holiday for 2002, services of thanksgiving were held in churches and a bonfire was lit during a party at the Governor-General's residence in Canberra.\n\nThroughout the year, events were held across Canada to mark the jubilee, such as the Jubilee Levée held by Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Lois Hole, which was attended by more than 4,000 Albertans and at which Hole stated: \"what we want to realize is how important the monarchy is to Canada and certainly to Alberta.\"\n\nFor 12 days in October 2002, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh toured Canada, making stops in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Hamilton, Hull, Fredericton, Sussex, Moncton, and Ottawa. The trip was also unique in that it was the first royal visit to the new territory of Nunavut, where the royal couple made their first Canadian stop in Iqaluit. There, on 4 October, the Queen opened and addressed the new legislative assembly, stating in her speech: \"I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian Royal Family to be greeted in Canada's newest territory.\" After a walk-about through Iqaluit, the Queen unveiled one of the street signs on the town's main thoroughfare, which had been renamed in her honour.\n\nFrom Nunavut, the royal party flew to Victoria, where the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were received by the province's lieutenant governor. Saturday was spent at a private retreat and, on the Sunday, the Queen attended religious services at Christ Church Cathedral, performed an unscheduled walk-about after the sermon, and travelled to the provincial parliament building to unveil a stained glass window commemorating the Golden Jubilee. Once Her Majesty was outside of the legislature, the Snowbirds performed an acrobatic fly-by for the sovereign and a gathered audience of some 16,000.\n\nIn Vancouver, on 6 October, the Queen, accompanied by Wayne Gretzky, and in front of a crowd of 18,000 at General Motors Place, dropped the ceremonial first puck for the National Hockey League exhibition game between the Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks; this was the first time any reigning monarch, Canadian or otherwise, had performed the task. The Queen and the Duke then watched the first period of the game from the royal box—the first time they had done so since their first hockey game at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1951. Premier Gordon Campbell said during the visit: \"Your Majesty, much as the world has changed in the last 50 years, one thing has always remained constant—the sincere affection between the people of British Columbia and their Queen.\"\n\nThe couple was next in Saskatchewan, unveiling on the grounds of the provincial parliament the product of the Golden Jubilee Statue Project: a bronze equestrian statue of the Queen riding Burmese, a horse gifted in 1969 to the Queen by the RCMP. In Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Queen performed a walk-about at The Forks, re-dedicated the newly restored Golden Boy statue atop the Manitoba Legislative Building, and attended an evening performance of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, accompanied by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and Loreena McKennitt.\n\nHer Majesty and His Royal Highness were on 9 October welcomed to Ontario by the lieutenant governor and thousands onlookers in Toronto, and, that evening, appeared at a festival, mounted at Exhibition Place, highlighting the advance of the province over the previous five decades. After a day of relaxation, the Queen then ventured to Sheridan College, to view students learning computer animation, and Hamilton, where at Copps Coliseum she, as their colonel-in-chief, presented the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada with their new Colours. Rejoined by her husband, Elizabeth attended at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Toronto headquarters an event marking the organisation's 50th anniversary; there, she viewed exhibits and was amused by a video display showing her earlier tours of Canada in the 1950s. Finally, the royal couple were in the audience at Roy Thomson Hall for a gala concert of Canadian talent, including Oscar Peterson, Evelyn Hart, Rex Harrington, Cirque du Soleil, The Tragically Hip, and others. At the same time, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council named a park near Gravenhurst as the Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park and created the Ontario Golden Jubilee Award for Civilian Bravery.\nAs the tour continued on to the maritime provinces, the royal party arrived at Government House in Fredericton, New Brunswick, where they were welcomed by thousands. The stop in this province was brief, however—only 25 hours in total—with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh flying by helicopter the following morning from Fredericton to Sussex and then on to Moncton, where they attended a luncheon in Dieppe to celebrate the town's 50th anniversary and officially opened a new terminal at Greater Moncton International Airport.\n\nFrom the east coast the royal couple flew westwards again to the national capital, Ottawa, to be greeted there by Deputy Prime Minister John Manley, who had earlier, on the day of the Queen's arrival in Canada, caused controversy by stating Canada should become a republic. The day following, 13 October, a multi-faith Thanksgiving celebration was held on Parliament Hill for about 3,500 people, and the Queen laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. A state dinner was held that evening at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau, Quebec, at which Her Majesty said: \"[I wish] to express my profound gratitude to all Canadians... for the loyalty, encouragement and support you have given to me over these past 50 years.\" As her motorcade passed across the Ottawa River into Quebec, about 100 protesters yelled obscenities at the Queen in French, waving Quebec flags and chanting \"We want a country, not a monarchy\"; it was the only protest during the jubilee tour of Canada.\n\nOn the last full day of the tour, the Queen, as Honorary Commissioner, watched a performance of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Musical Ride before moving to her final major event in Canada: a lunch at Rideau Hall for fifty distinguished Canadians—one from each year of Elizabeth's reign. The Queen also planted another tree on the grounds of her Canadian residence, and met with members of the Royal Commonwealth Society. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh then departed Canada on 15 October.\n\nElizabeth's first official engagements related to the Golden Jubilee took place in Jamaica. She had acceded in 1952 as queen of the United Kingdom and became distinctly queen of Jamaica 10 years later; her tour of the island therefore coincided with the country's 40th anniversary of independence. She arrived for the celebrations on 18 February 2002, nine days following the death of her sister, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon; the Queen established a short period of private, though not state, mourning. Elizabeth was first welcomed in Montego Bay, after which she travelled to Kingston and stayed at her Jamaican prime minister's residence, Jamaica House.\n\nDespite some anti-monarchical sentiment in the country at the time, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were \"enthusiastically welcomed\" by Jamaicans; 57% of those polled said the visit was important to the country and large crowds turned out to see Elizabeth, though there were small protests by Rastafarians seeking reparations for slavery and their repatriation to Africa. The Queen received an official welcome at King's House, the Governor-General's residence, met with Jamaican veterans of the First World War, addressed her Jamaican parliament, and visited an underprivileged area of Kingston, known as Trenchtown, viewing urban poverty projects while there. The tour ended on a unique note when, at the final banquet in Jamaica, a power outage plunged King's House into darkness during the meal; Elizabeth described the event as \"memorable\".\n\nFollowing her tour of Jamaica, the Queen next toured New Zealand, making stops in Auckland, Taupo, Christchurch, and Wellington. She and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived in the country on 22 February, just after Prime Minister Helen Clark said in a speech that she felt it \"inevitable that New Zealand will become a republic.\" The royal couple were greeted by the Governor-General and other officials when they disembarked from the Royal Flight; Clark was absent, as she was at a meeting of centre-left leaders in Stockholm, Sweden. A low turn out was reported to see the Queen when she arrived at the airport, while an estimated 4,000 people came to view the Queen in Auckland.\n\nCelebrations for Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee took place throughout the United Kingdom between May and July 2002. In the lead-up to those festive weeks, the British media—\"The Guardian\", in particular—predicted that the jubilee would be a failure, arguing that Britain was no longer interested in the monarchy; a pervading sense of apathy amongst the populace seemed to confirm this. However, the predictions were proven wrong, especially during the official jubilee weekend, when people numbering in the hundreds of thousands turned out to participate in the fêtes. These festivities culminated in the 4 June event on The Mall in London, when over one million attended the parade and flypast. The \"Daily Mail\" stated in its editorial: \"How the sour anti-Royalists in \"The Guardian\" newspaper and elsewhere have been confounded. They were convinced that the occasion would be a flop, that the House of Windsor was no longer capable of inspiring the loyalties it once did and that anyway the concept of royalty was passe in cool Britannia.\"\nIt was on 3 March that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh returned to London from Australia. Eight days later, on Commonwealth Day, the Commonwealth Secretariat unveiled at Buckingham Palace a portrait of Elizabeth, painted by Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy that had been commissioned to mark the Queen's 50 years as Head of the Commonwealth; the work now hangs at Marlborough House, with a study kept as part of the Queen's collection at St James's Palace. At the end of the month, however, the Queen was dealt another blow when her mother died on 30 March; the Commonwealth realms observed a period of mourning, and on 9 April, the day of her funeral, more than one million people filled the area outside Westminster Abbey and along the route from central London to the Queen Mother's final resting place beside her husband and younger daughter in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nPlans for the Golden Jubilee in the United Kingdom went ahead as planned, and, after a dinner hosted by Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street for her and all her living former British Prime Ministers (Sir John Major, The Baroness Thatcher, Sir Edward Heath, and The Lord Callaghan of Cardiff), the Queen officially launched the celebrations in the UK with a speech to both houses of the British parliament at Westminster Hall on 30 April, marking the fifth time in five decades that Elizabeth II addressed her British parliament on her own account. The Queen spoke of 50 unforgettable years and the changes to British life and society in that time, and elaborated that the monarchy must change also; Elizabeth said she had \"witnessed the transformation of the international landscape through which [the United Kingdom] must chart its course\" and declared her \"resolve to continue, with the support of [the Royal Family], to serve the people... to the best of [her] ability through the changing times ahead.\"\n\nFor the Queen's goodwill visits, which commenced on 1 May, two to three days were spent in each corner of England; the Queen and the Duke first stopped in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset before travelling to Tyne and Wear, then finally to Buckinghamshire and Berkshire. On 13 May, the couple were received in Northern Ireland, and visited such areas as County Fermanagh, Cookstown, and Omagh. Then, throughout much of mid-May, the royal couple were in London devoting much time to the promotion of the arts, attending the Chelsea Flower Show, dedicating the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace, and attending a reception at the Royal Academy of Arts. The jubilee trips recommenced on 23 May with a six-day trip to Scotland; the royals first stopped in Glasgow, and then travelled on to Edinburgh, Dundee, Stornoway and Aberdeen, and, following the jubilee weekend in London, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on 7 June toured West Sussex, spent three days in Wales, touring Anglesey, Llanelli, and Cardiff. The next month, the royal couple made two-day trips to the West Midlands, Yorkshire (where the Queen visited the set of the soap opera \"Emmerdale\"), and the counties of Suffolk and Norfolk, as well as undertaking a three-day goodwill trip to Liverpool and Manchester, where the Queen opened the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The Queen closed out July by touring the East Midlands, and ended her domestic tour by visiting Lancashire.\n\nAmongst several other events independently organised to celebrate the Jubilee in June 2002 were the British Army's staging at Portsmouth of a special parade of 6,000 personnel from all three branches of the British Armed Forces. This contrasted with the vastly larger events of past Royal Jubilee, in that there was no Royal Naval Fleet Review, or large scale Army Review. The Queen's bodyguards mounted a conjoined parade, wherein 300 members of the Gentlemen at Arms, Yeoman of the Guard, and Yeoman Warders all marched together for the first time in the centuries since their respective foundations. Elizabeth also hosted a banquet for all of Europe's reigning kings and queens, one for all her incumbent Governors-General, and garden parties at both Buckingham Palace and Holyrood Palace for people born on Accession Day 1952. Around the country, street parties were organised, for which some 40,000 toolkits were distributed.\n\nThe Golden Jubilee Weekend took place between 1 and 4 June 2002 in London, for which the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh left Scotland on 29 May to make final preparations. On the first evening, the Saturday, the \"Prom at the Palace\" took place in the gardens of Buckingham Palace and highlighted classical music; out of the two million who applied for tickets, 12,500 people were selected to attend, making the event the largest ever held on the royal property. The crowds were entertained by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and BBC Symphony Chorus, conducted by Sir Andrew Davis, and guest vocalists included Kiri Te Kanawa, Thomas Allen, Angela Gheorghiu, and Roberto Alagna.\n\nThe following day, the Queen and her husband attended a church service at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, while their family were present at thanksgiving services elsewhere in the United Kingdom; The Prince of Wales and his sons, Princes William and Harry, in Swansea; The Earl and Countess of Wessex in Salisbury; and The Princess Royal in Ayr.\n\nAfter time on 3 June touring Eton and Slough, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh returned to London and the former at 1:00 pm launched the nationwide BBC Music Live Festival, in which more than 200 towns and cities across the United Kingdom publicly played the Beatles song \"All You Need Is Love\". During the day, street parties were held around the country, and that evening, the Queen, the Duke, and other members of the immediate Royal Family, made themselves present at another concert on the grounds of Buckingham Palace; this fête, called \"Party at the Palace\", showcased achievements in pop music over the previous 50 years, with headlining acts including Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Cliff Richard, and Tony Bennett. \"Queen\" guitarist Brian May commenced the event by playing his arrangement of \"God Save the Queen\" from the roof of the palace, and Paul McCartney concluded the night with such numbers as \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Hey Jude\", which were each performed before and after the Queen lit the National Beacon at the Victoria Memorial, the last in a string of 2,006 beacons to be lit in a chain throughout the world, echoing Queen Victoria's own Golden Jubilee in 1887. 12,000 guests were allowed into the concert, while an additional one million people thronged The Mall to watch and listen to the festivities on giant television screens and join in with the palace audience's singing from outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, and a further 200 million watched the televised event around the world.\nOn 4 June, the entire royal family attended the National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral, to which the Queen rode in the Gold State Coach, followed by lunch at the Guildhall. There the Queen addressed the crowd and expressed pride at the Commonwealth's achievements, both during her reign as queen and throughout time; Elizabeth was quoted as saying: \"Gratitude, respect and pride, these words sum up how I feel about the people of this country and the Commonwealth—and what this Golden Jubilee means to me.\" The jubilee procession then started along The Mall in the early afternoon; in addition to entertainers performing for the Queen, numerous floats were decorated to illustrate British life through the years of Elizabeth's reign and driven through The Mall. The parade concluded with 5,000 adults and children from the 54 member-states of the Commonwealth of Nations marching in their various national costumes before the Queen and presenting to her a \"rainbow of wishes\", consisting of handwritten notes from school children across the Commonwealth. In front of more than one million people, the Royal Family assembled on the balcony of the Centre Room of Buckingham Palace and watched a flypast consisting of every type of Royal Air Force aircraft in service (27 in all), Concorde, and the Red Arrows. There was only one publicly noted negative event in relation to the jubilee when approximately 40 activists, mostly drawn from the anarchist Movement Against the Monarchy, were arrested during a protest in the run-up to the Jubilee Weekend.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British Overseas Territory, for the first four days of June, celebrations took place throughout the Islands, presided over by Governor Mervyn Jones. The Public Relations Department of the Tourist Board for the Jubilee Committee produced the Jubilee Souvenir Brochure, with text and images covering historical Royal Visits provided by the National Museum; only 5,000 were produced, issue number 1 being given to Queen Elizabeth II herself. The museum also provided photographs for the production of three sets of stamps, and, for the Jubilee Weekend, prepared a temporary exhibition on royal visits, with other items from the past, such as the coronation medals issued in to some local residents in 1953. Other items produced to commemorate the Jubilee were a straw crown made on Middle Caicos by Loathie Harvey and Judy Geddis, two 20-crown coins, and a badge given to all school children as a memento of the historic occasion.\n\nThe Golden Jubilee was also marked in New York City, where the pinnacle of the Empire State Building was lit in royal purple and gold. The city's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and officials at the British consulate said the tribute was a sign of thanks both to the Queen for having had the American national anthem played at Buckingham Palace during the Changing of the Guard on 13 September 2001 and to the British people for their support afterwards. It had been more than 10 years since the Empire State Building gave such an honour to an individual not from the United States; the most recent instance was when Nelson Mandela visited New York after his release from prison in 1990.\n\nBefore, during, and after the jubilee year, souvenirs were created, monuments unveiled, and public works named in commemoration of the royal event. In Australia, Australia Post released a special stamp combining old and new images of Queen Elizabeth II, along with a booklet outlining the Queen's reign.\n\nIn Canada, the Governor-in-Council earmarked $CAD 250,000 as a donation in the Queen's name to the Dominion Institute's Memory Project, aimed at educating Canadian youth on the experiences and contributions of the country's veterans from the First World War through to modern peacekeeping missions. The provinces also marked the milestone; the Ontario Governor-in-Council, on the advice of his premier, approved the renaming of Dalton Digby Wildlands Provincial Park as the Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park and, in Saskatchewan, an equestrian statue of Queen Elizabeth II was commissioned and erected alongside the Queen Elizabeth II Gardens on the grounds of the Legislative Building. In Alberta, the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Recognition Act established the Queen's Golden Jubilee Citizenship Medal, the Queen's Golden Jubilee Scholarship for the Visual and Performing Arts, and the Premier's Citizenship Award in Recognition of the Queen's Golden Jubilee.\n\nA special £5 coin was released in the United Kingdom to celebrate the event, and the annual Queen's Golden Jubilee Award for volunteer service groups was founded in 2002, while private enterprises produced various ornaments and trinkets as memorabilia of the jubilee; manufacturers such as Spode created various forms of commemorative china and crystalware. At Windsor Castle, the Jubilee Gardens were opened, the first new public area to be created since 1820, and a 167 feet (51-metre) inverted roller coaster, Jubilee Odyssey, was constructed at the Fantasy Island theme park in Lincolnshire.\n\nIt was argued in retrospective analysis that the jubilee had been of benefit both to nationalism and the monarchy; the \"Daily Mail\" stated: \"Below and in front of her an event as magical and magnificent as the Golden Jubilee itself was unfurling before her captivated eyes—Britain was rediscovering the land of hope and glory,\" and \"The Globe and Mail\" said: \"When she daintily bent over to drop a puck at an NHL game... she achieved perhaps the most brilliant melding of symbolism in Canadian history... The Jumbotron in Vancouver's GM Place said it all, flashing the Queen's golden EIIR cypher on the giant screen atop the beer advertisement: 'I am Canadian'. The crowd went hysterical.\"\n\n\n"}

It is one of the largest high schools in British Columbia. Enrollment of students is open to those within grades 9 through 12. The school is home to the International Baccalaureate program, facilities such as an Automotive shop, and a 1 year apprenticeship program. In 2007, the Fraser Institute ranked the school well within the top 50 secondary schools in British Columbia. This was out of the 279 public and private secondary schools operating in the province. \nThe School is located in Metro Vancouver in BC's Lower Mainland region while the campus is centrally located within the region on the north side of the city of New Westminster. It encompasses an area of three city blocks by two city blocks.\n\nPrior to the 1860s the site of the present school was a public cemetery where many of the prominent citizens of New Westminster were interred. Many of the citizens who were buried in this public cemetery were part of the Chinese community and as well as the Sikh's and Indigenous. After development in the 1870s the remains of those buried were transferred to the Fraser Cemetery, located elsewhere in the city. During the Second World War the corner of 10th Avenue and 8th, where the present school is located, was leased to the Federal Government. The site served as a soldiers' barracks, used for training and housing the Royal Westminster Regiment. After World War II, the barracks were moved to the University of British Columbia and the rest of the cemetery was demolished. Finally, in 1948 The public works yard was moved and the site was transferred to the New Westminster School Board for the construction of offices and a new high school.\n\nIn September 1949 Vincent Massey Junior High was unofficially opened by Premier Bryan I. Johnson. On December 16, 1949, the school was officially opened. The school was named after the Right Honourable Vincent Massey, the eighteenth Governor General of Canada. The adjoining Pearson wing, named after the Right Honourable Lester Pearson, former Canadian Prime Minister, was home to the Senior High School prior to the two becoming amalgamated into the present New Westminster Secondary School.\n\nThe NWSS International Baccalaureate (IB) program is a pre-university course of studies, offered at NWSS since 2000. The school offers the Diploma Program (DP), the Certificate Program (CP), and an unofficial Pre-IB Programme. All of the programs require an exam entry, although exam entry into the Diploma and Certificate programs is not required if moving on from the Pre-IB Program. At NWSS, the Pre-IB Program prepares students for the rigors of the global IB Program by increasing the difficulty and workloads of the students. The Pre-IB Programme contains a course called RIM, or Research in Motion. This course is meant to give students a basis in discussion of ethics and technology useful in the diploma programme. It includes a research paper known as the Long Term Project (LTP), imitable of the 3000 word Extended Essay completed by Diploma candidates.\n\nThe school has an ESL program for students whose second language is English. This program is offered to many International Students. A French Immersion program includes classes purely taught in French. This is the continuation of the Glenbrook Middle School late French immersion program. In this program, students are expected to speak French in most classes and upon finishing it, have almost native fluency.\n\nNew Westminster Secondary School has more than 16 sports teams including:\n\nThe New Westminster School District has announced the plans for the replacement of the New Westminster Secondary School (NWSS). NWSS will continue to be the biggest school in the Province of British Columbia with this largest and most complex construction project in the history of the province.\n\nMinister of Education Mike Bernier came to New Westminster on Tuesday, June 7, 2016, to announce the long-awaited funding approval for the New Westminster Secondary School replacement project. The $106.5 million replacement of New Westminster Secondary School will be completed near the end of the summer of 2020. This $106.5 million dollar budget for the new school is the largest budget in BC history to be allocated to a school. Upon its completion, the new school will be home for over 2100 grade 9 to 12 students. The new school will be designed to meet today's standards for safety, accessibility and modern learning.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2065394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065394", "title": "Box-and-one defense", "text": "Box-and-one defense\n\nBox-and-one defense is a type of defense used in basketball. The box-and-one defense is a hybrid between a man-to-man defense (in which each defensive player is responsible for marking a player on the other team) and a zone defense (in which each defensive player is responsible for guarding an area of the court).\n\nIn a box-and-one defense, four players play zone defense, and align themselves in a box protecting the basket, with typically the two larger (or frontcourt) players playing directly under the basket, and the two smaller (or backcourt) players playing towards the foul line. The fifth defensive player in a box-and-one defense plays man-to-man defense, typically marking the best offensive player on the other team.\n\nA box-and-one defense is usually used against teams with one dominant scoring threat. The idea is to try to shut that player down by forcing them to score against a dedicated man-to-man player, and a supporting zone. Players such as Allen Iverson and Ray Allen often faced box-and-one defensive schemes while competing for Georgetown University and the University of Connecticut, respectively.\n\nOne variation is the \"diamond-and-one defense\", where the four players in the box are arranged in a diamond pattern (one under the basket, two between the basket and foul line, and the fourth at the foul line). Another variation is the triangle-and-two defense, in which three defenders play zone defense while the remaining two play man-to-man defense.\n\nThe biggest weakness of a box-and-one defense is its vulnerability to a pass to the middle of the \"box\". As there is no defensive player responsible for this area of the court, offensive teams are able to exploit the gap. A pass to the middle of the box or to the top of the box will generally yield a short-range shot from inside the key. Or, it will “collapse” the box, causing the four zone defenders to fall inside the key and, upon a second pass, yielding a wide open and uncontested look from the perimeter. It is for this reason that the box-and-one defense is not often seen in professional leagues. \n\nThe defense was notably used in games 2, 4, and 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals between the Toronto Raptors and Golden State Warriors. The Raptors utilized a box-and-one defense late in game 2 in order to shut down Steph Curry as he was the lone offensive scoring threat once Klay Thompson left with an injury and Kevin Durant was ruled out. This tactic prevented the Golden State Warriors from scoring for over five minutes. The Raptors were narrowly defeated despite having given up an 18–0 run at the start of the third quarter. In game 4, the Raptors once again employed the same defense in a 105–92 win to take a 3–1 series lead. After Thompson was injured in game 6, the Raptors again employed the box-and-one against Curry and won the game to win the championship.\n\nIn addition to the notable to use of the box-and-one defense in the NBA Finals against Stephen Curry, the Brooklyn Nets used this defensive scheme against shooting guard Bradley Beal of the Washington Wizards, in a regular season game on February 26, 2020.\n\nThis strategy is also used in a man down situation in lacrosse. When a team has a penalty and is down a man, the team will send out a Long Stick Midfielder to add to the three Long Stick defensemen. As well there is one short stick midfielder. The Long Sticks make a tight box in front of the goal with the short stick on the crease. The four long sticks will play zone defense, with the closest man to the ball playing man to man, and the farthest splitting two offensemen. Every time the ball is passed the formation rotates to the next man. The short stick will play man to man if there is an attackman on the crease, otherwise he will join the rotation.\n\nThis strategy is also used in the sport of ultimate frisbee, which relies on defenses sometimes similar to basketball in its mixture of man and zone formats. In ultimate, the box-and-one defense is usually incorporated into a defensive strategy called the \"cup\", where 3 other players play a zone around the player in possession of the disc. If the boxed player is a handler (similar to a point guard in basketball) in possession of the disc, the cup will include the boxed player temporarily in their zone.\n\n\n"}

Ray Nagin (born June 11, 1956), is an American former politician and convicted felon who was the 60th Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, from 2002 to 2010. A Democrat, Nagin became internationally known in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nNagin was first elected as mayor in March 2002. He was re-elected in 2006 when the election was held with at least two-thirds of New Orleans citizens still displaced after Katrina struck. Term-limited by law, he left office on May 3, 2010.\n\nAfter leaving office, Nagin founded CRN Initiatives LLC, a firm that focuses on emergency preparedness, green energy product development, publishing, and public speaking. He wrote and self-published \"Katrina Secrets: Storms after the Storms\".\n\nIn 2014, Nagin was convicted on twenty of twenty-one charges of wire fraud, bribery, and money laundering related to bribes from city contractors before and after Katrina<ref name=\"New Orleans Times Picayune/nola.com\">Live coverage: Ray Nagin convicted, guilty on 20 charges | NOLA.com</ref> and was sentenced to ten years in federal prison.\n\nNagin was born on June 11, 1956, in New Orleans' Charity Hospital, to a family of modest means. His childhood was typical of that of urban youth, and his father held two jobs: a janitor at New Orleans City Hall by night and a fabric cutter at a clothing factory by day. After the factory shut down his father became a fleet mechanic at a local dairy, to earn sufficient pay to support his family. His mother was employed as manager of a Kmart in-store restaurant. The family lived on Allen Street in the 7th Ward, followed by a stay near St. Peter Claver Catholic Church in the Tremé, and then moved to the Cutoff section of Algiers. Nagin attended St. Augustine High School and O. Perry Walker High School, where he played basketball and baseball. He enrolled at historically black Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama, on a baseball scholarship, played on championship teams, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting in 1978. He became a Certified Public Accountant.\n\nAfter graduating from college, he went to work in the purchasing department at General Motors in Detroit, Michigan. He moved to Los Angeles, California, then to Dallas, Texas in 1981 to take Internal Audit Manager and Division Controller jobs with Associates Corporation.\n\nIn 1982, Nagin married Seletha Smith, a New Orleans native. Together, they have three children. In 1985, Nagin returned to New Orleans to become the controller of Cox New Orleans, the city's cable television franchise, run by the Cox media conglomerate. The franchise had a history of customer complaints, low profits, and stagnant growth, and was one of the poorest-performing components within Cox. Nagin was quickly promoted to general manager. In 1989, he was appointed to oversee all of Cox properties in south Louisiana as vice-president and general manager of Cox Louisiana, earning $400,000 annually, according to CNBC's \"American Greed\"\n\nIn 1993, Nagin enrolled in the executive MBA program at Tulane University. Nagin also lobbied at the local, State, and Federal government levels, as many of the businesses he managed were regulated and required formal franchise renewals. His public profile was high because he hosted a twice-weekly television call-in show for customers.\n\nIn 1995, Nagin received the Young Leadership Council Diversity and Role Model Award and later sat on the boards of the United Way and Covenant House. He also was one of the founders and president of 100 Black Men of metro New Orleans, an affiliate of the national organization of black businessmen.\n\nNagin was a partner in a group that brought the New Orleans Brass to the city. Nagin became the team's president and investors' spokesman as they secured the hockey franchise. The initial popularity of the team allowed the group to secure the 18,000-seat New Orleans Arena as its home venue. That year, the local alternative newspaper \"Gambit Weekly\" named Nagin as its New Orleanian of the Year.\n\nSeveral news sources, including BBC News, have stated that Nagin was a registered Republican for most of his adult life, and a George W. Bush supporter, but then switched to the Democratic Party shortly prior to seeking office in New Orleans. In 2004, he endorsed John Kerry for president. In a January 13, 2006 interview on the \"Tavis Smiley Show\", Nagin denied this, stating that he \"never was a Republican\" and that he has been a \"life-long Democrat\", and several news organizations that reported he was originally a Republican were forced to issue retractions. However, he periodically gave contributions to candidates of both parties, including Representative Billy Tauzin in 1999 and 2000, as well as Democrat Senators John Breaux and J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. earlier in the decade. Nagin endorsed conservative Republican Bobby Jindal over conservative Democrat Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Blanco in the 2003 runoff for governor.\n\nNagin entered the race for mayor on the final day of qualifying. \nShortly before the primary mayoral election, on January 17, 2002, the \"New Orleans Times Picayune\" and \"Gambit Weekly\" endorsed Nagin.\n\nIn the first round of the mayoral election in February 2002, Nagin won first place with 29 percent of the vote. Some of his opponents were the Police Chief Richard Pennington, State Senator Paulette Irons, and City Councilman Troy Carter. In the runoff on Saturday, March 2, 2002, Nagin defeated Richard Pennington with 59 percent of the votes to become the 60th mayor of New Orleans.\n\nThe 2004 \"Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the City of New Orleans\", as certified by CPA firm KPMG, highlighted many significant accomplishments of the Nagin administration. New Orleans gained 4,500 jobs that year. U.S. Census Bureau figures showed about 38,000 New Orleanians had risen out of poverty as the national average increased. According to \"The American City Business Journal\", per capita income in New Orleans was rising at the fastest rate in the nation.\n\n\"Southern Business and Development\" named New Orleans number eight on the list of \"comeback kids\" in the south. New Orleans had back-to-back record tourist years, 10.1 million in 2004. A Yahoo/\"National Geographic Traveler\" poll named the city its number one family destination. Since 2002, the area had seen over $400 million of film productions, including movies like the Oscar award-winning \"Ray\", starring Jamie Foxx, and \"All the King's Men\", featuring Sean Penn. According to \"MovieMaker Magazine\", New Orleans was the fourth-best place to film a movie and had earned the title \"Hollywood South\".\n\nIn November 2004, the Nagin administration passed the city's largest bond issue, $260 million. New Orleans also jumped from 69th to 38th on Intel's list of \"Most Wired Cities\". The city's website went from being unranked to the 4th best in the nation.\n\nAs Hurricane Ivan threatened the Gulf of Mexico in September 2004, Nagin urged New Orleanians to be ready for the storm. He advised evacuees to have some \"Benjamins\" ($100 bills) handy and urged those planning to stay not only to stock up on food and water but also to make sure they had \"an axe in the attic\". This was a reference to the many people trapped in their attics by rising floodwaters when Hurricane Betsy hit the city in 1965. Nagin issued a voluntary evacuation call at 6 p.m. on September 30th, and the interstates quickly filled as some 600,000 metro New Orleanians left. Traffic was so heavy that some trips took 12 hours or more. The hurricane missed the city.\n\nIn August 2005, Hurricane Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico. Early on Friday, August 26, Mayor Nagin advised New Orleanians to keep a close eye on the storm and prepare for evacuation. He then made several public statements encouraging people to leave and advising that if they did not evacuate, \"We will take care of you\". By 10 a.m. Saturday, a mandatory evacuation was called for low-lying areas in the surrounding parishes—St. Charles, St. Tammany, Plaquemines, and Jefferson—and a voluntary evacuation for St. Bernard Parish. Nagin had, however, ignored federal and state offers of help and a recommendation to evacuate the city.\n\nIn addition to the parishes' announcements, President George W. Bush declared a federal state of emergency for Louisiana.\n\nIn accordance with the regional evacuation plan, New Orleans, along with the surrounding areas of Jefferson and St. Charles parishes, were given formal voluntary evacuation orders around 50 hours from landfall. This phased approach along with \"contraflow\", wherein all incoming interstate highway lanes are reversed outward, ensured that additional vehicles moving onto already congested roads would not create massive gridlock. The local newspaper reported that Nagin stopped short of ordering a mandatory evacuation because of concerns about the city's liability for closing hotels and other businesses.\n\nAfter receiving a late night Saturday call from Max Mayfield, head of the National Hurricane Center, Nagin was advised that Katrina was headed to New Orleans. He ordered the city attorney to prepare legal documents for a mandatory evacuation of the city, the first in New Orleans' almost 300-year history. On Sunday, August 28 at 9:30 a.m., the mandatory evacuation order was signed and communicated to the public. The Superdome was opened as a shelter of last resort and police went throughout the city with loudspeakers alerting all remaining citizens to go to key pickup points for free bus rides. By Sunday evening 80% of New Orleanians and visitors were evacuated or relocated.\n\nAfter the hurricane hit, the federally built and maintained levees collapsed throughout the city. 80% of the city flooded, some areas as high as 20 feet, over rooftops. Food and water became scarce. Looting was common. After hearing reports on his wind up radio, Nagin criticized the federal and state response on WWL radio and his passionate outburst went viral.\n\nAt a town hall meeting in October 2005, Nagin said: \"I can see in your eyes, you want to know, 'How do I take advantage of this incredible opportunity? How do I make sure New Orleans is not overrun with Mexican workers\". This was in response to a question from the audience. Some Hispanic groups, including the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, criticized Nagin's statement, although those attending the town hall meeting reportedly applauded—many believing jobs should first go to locals displaced by the hurricane. Nagin went on to say this was the city's biggest economic opportunity and urged New Orleanians to get more comfortable working beside someone who did not look like them, as everyone's help was needed. During a subsequent interview on Telemundo with Jose Diaz-Balart, Nagin praised the great work Hispanic workers did in New Orleans and said the city would not have recovered without them.\n\nShortly after Katrina devastated New Orleans, there were calls for moratoriums on rebuilding certain neighborhoods. Two weeks after Katrina struck, Nagin took a weekend trip to Dallas to reunite with his family. While there, he was asked to meet with leading New Orleans businessmen to discuss the city's future. Nagin says he made it clear at the meeting that everyone had a right to return home, a claim contradicted by some businessmen in attendance.\n\nMany of the initial proposals to rebuild New Orleans focused on rebuilding areas with the highest likelihood of economic return. Many groups expressed concern that this might radically change the racial make-up of the city. The land deemed most economically viable was mostly city land above sea-level, in which the most economically-advantaged and white citizens resided; the majority of New Orleanians, especially black residents, lived in the outer edges of the city, where land was mostly below sea-level and deemed less economically viable. Nagin disavowed such proposals, and in response to residents' concerns, he used the phrase \"Chocolate City\" to signal that New Orleans would remain a majority black city. He first used the phrase during a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebration speech in New Orleans on January 16, 2006 and repeated the metaphor several times. This was seized upon and parodied by some commentators, cartoons, and merchandising. Various designs of T-shirts with satirical depictions of Nagin as Willy Wonka were sold in the city and on the Internet.\n\nNagin also said that New Orleans \"will be a majority African-American city because this was what God wants it to be.\" Some people found the implication of Nagin claiming to know God's will to be as troubling as the racial aspects of his speech. He then condemned Washington D.C., by saying God \"sent us hurricane after hurricane after hurricane, and it's destroyed and put stress on this country\", suggesting God's disapproval of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn an interview with Tavis Smiley broadcast on Public Radio International on January 13, 2006, Nagin said he used the phrase \"chocolate city\" in reference to a time in the 1970s when African Americans were just starting to exercise political power in places like Washington, D.C. The term had been used in many of Nagin's previous speeches and welcoming addresses to visitors of the city. The idea reportedly originated with the song \"Chocolate City\" by the popular 1970s funk group Parliament.\n\nAt the time of the 2006 election, at least two-thirds of its residents were still displaced. One candidate said in his \"Times Picayune\" interview he was running because the city's demographics had dramatically changed. There were three unsuccessful lawsuits filed to prevent delaying the original election date.\n\nIn the April 22 election, Nagin was the front runner with 38% of the vote. Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu came in second with 29%. Nagin and Landrieu faced each other in a run-off election on May 20, 2006. Nagin defeated Landrieu 52% to 48%.\n\nNagin's second term began on June 1, 2006. He was intensely criticized by the local media throughout this term. For example, his \"100-day plan\" to accelerate the rebuilding of New Orleans was bashed for what critics said was a tardy release, lack of details and activity in moving forward. Nagin administration spokesperson Rob Couhig backed away from a 100-day promise, stating that it was not meant as a \"time period,\" but as a short-range initiative to improve quality-of-life issues. Delays in FEMA reimbursements and federal recovery dollars reaching the city caused many significant delays.\n\nHe was also a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino.\n\nIn 2006, Nagin was also criticized for devoting time to extensive lobbying in Washington, DC and a national speaking tour. Nagin's administration said this was necessary in order to correct inaccurate perceptions of New Orleans and secure recovery support.\n\nIn addition during 2007, a drastic increase in the city's violent crime rate led to more criticism of Nagin. Nagin called for and got help from the Louisiana National Guard and U.S. Justice Department. However, Nagin continued to be heavily criticized by the local newspaper. He reignited complaints when he said news of two killings should keep focus on the city's needs for more help and, \"while sad, keeps the New Orleans brand out there.\"\n\nNagin hired recovery expert Dr. Ed Blakely in 2007 to head up a dedicated Office of Recovery Management. The Rockefeller, Ford and Bill & Melinda Gates foundations provided grants for critical staff enhancements. During the end of 2007 and into 2008 Nagin guided the city through an extensive planning process that documented a $14 billion need. However, the state only allocated 2% of the plan and it took almost three years to receive any of these federal recovery dollars.\n\nBy years 4 and 5, New Orleans made significant progress toward recovery. 85% of all city managed recovery projects were either recently completed, under construction, or in final design. By the end of 2009, there were over $20 billion in public & private sector construction related projects underway.\n\n\"Business Week\" said New Orleans was one of the best cities in America to ride out the great recession. \"Money\" Magazine ranked the city as the sixth-fastest-growing real estate market. \"Outside\" Magazine said New Orleans was the 20th best town in American to live in. The U.S. Department of Labor in its April 2010 report said New Orleans had the lowest unemployment in the nation.\n\nPrior to leaving office in 2010, Nagin was appointed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to head the United States delegation to a state and local governments conference on assistance to post-earthquake Haiti held in Martinique. A recovery plan was completed and presented to donor nations resulting in Haiti receiving billions in pledges.\n\nOn April 7, 2009, the \"Times-Picayune\" alleged a conflict of interest with regard to a trip Nagin took to Hawaii in 2004. The vacation Nagin, then-chief technology officer Greg Meffert, and their families took in 2004 was claimed to be partially paid for by Meffert, but years later it was revealed that Meffert used a contractor's credit card to pay for Nagin's plane ticket. David Hammer of the \"Times-Picayune\" reported on April 23, 2009, that Nagin had taken \"plenty of other trips\" at the expense of NetMethods, a company owned by city vendor Mark St. Pierre.\n\nIn April 2009, Nagin was obliged \"to sit for a deposition as part of a civil lawsuit over the city's controversial crime camera program.\" The \"Times-Picayune\" had obtained information that Mark St. Pierre, who allegedly paid for the holiday, had made substantial donations to Nagin's 2006 re-election campaign.\n\nMeffert was later charged with 63 felony counts in what authorities say \"was a lucrative kickback scheme.\" All but two of the counts were subsequently dropped, and Meffert eventually pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of filing a false income tax return.\n\nIn April 2010, as a result of a FOIA request from a New Orleans news station, Nagin was investigated for destroying his official city emails. After a forensic investigation by computer forensics firm SunBlock Systems, 5,400 emails were recovered. Many of these emails were subsequently used as evidence in his 2013 criminal trial.\n\nIn June 2012, Frank Fradella, who was facing major securities fraud charges, pleaded guilty in New Orleans federal court to one count of conspiracy to bribe a public official. According to \"The Times-Picayune\", Fradella claims to have paid $50,000 and delivered truckloads of free granite to Nagin's sons' business in exchange for favorable treatment for Fradella's companies with city contracts.\n\nOn January 18, 2013, Nagin was indicted on 21 corruption charges, including wire fraud, conspiracy, bribery, money laundering, and filing false tax returns related to bribes from city contractors. The 21-count federal corruption charges were issued by a grand jury. On February 20, 2013, Nagin pleaded not guilty in federal court to all charges. Despite New Orleans' long history of political corruption, Nagin was the first mayor to be criminally charged for corruption in office.\n\nNagin was convicted on 20 of the 21 counts by jury on February 12, 2014.<ref name=\"New Orleans Times Picayune/nola.com\">Live coverage: Ray Nagin convicted, guilty on 20 charges | NOLA.com</ref> These charges included that he had taken more than $500,000 in payouts from businessmen in exchange for millions of dollars' worth of city contracts.<ref name=\"New Orleans Times Picayune/nola.com\">Live coverage: Ray Nagin convicted, guilty on 20 charges | NOLA.com</ref>\n\nJudge Helen Ginger Berrigan, a Bill Clinton appointee to the federal bench, ordered a pre-sentencing investigation. On July 9, 2014, Nagin was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, and more than $585,000 in restitution and forfeiture. Berrigan recommended that Nagin be sent to the Federal Correctional Complex, Oakdale. On July 15, 2014, Nagin's attorney filed an appeal with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Nagin lost another appeal of his case in July 2019.\n\nOn September 3, 2014, a judge deemed Nagin indigent and ordered the Federal Public Defender's Office to take over his appeal. Nagin said he was near penniless and relying on food stamps. Nagin reported to the Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana, a prison camp, on September 8, 2014. Nagin, Bureau of Prisons (BOP) #32751-034, is presently incarcerated at this facility. His earliest possible release date is May 25, 2023. He was released into house arrest on April 27, 2020 due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2065420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065420", "title": "WMAR-TV", "text": "WMAR-TV\n\nWMAR-TV, virtual channel 2 (UHF digital channel 38), is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The station is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company. WMAR-TV's studios and offices are located on York Road (Maryland Route 45) in Towson (though with a Baltimore City mailing address), north of the Baltimore City–Baltimore County border. Its transmitter and antenna, which is on the landmark three-pronged candelabra broadcast tower, is located on Television Hill in the Woodberry neighborhood of Baltimore.\n\nOn cable, the station is carried on channel 12 on most Baltimore area cable systems, including Verizon Fios, and on channel 2 on most outlying areas of the market.\n\nWMAR first began broadcasting on October 27, 1947. It was the first television station in Maryland, and was the fourteenth television station in the United States to begin commercial operations. WMAR was founded by the A. S. Abell Company, publisher of the \"Sunpapers\" (\"The Baltimore Sun\" and its evening counterpart, \"The Evening Sun\") and was the first completed phase of the \"Sunpapers\" expansion into broadcasting; the newspapers also held construction permits for WMAR-FM, which signed-on at 97.9 MHz (frequency now occupied by WIYY) in January 1948 and a proposed WMAR (AM), which never made it to air. Channel 2's first broadcast was a pair of horse races emanating from Pimlico Race Course.\n\nWMAR-TV's studios, offices, transmitter and tower were initially located at the present-day Bank of America Building in downtown Baltimore; the studios were later shifted into a larger space adjacent to the building. WMAR-TV moved into its present facility, known originally as \"Television Park\" on York Road, in May 1963.\n\nChannel 2 was an independent station at its launch, largely because at the time it was not clear whether Baltimore would be part of the Washington, D.C. market (Baltimore is 45 minutes northeast of Washington, and most of the Washington stations decently cover the Baltimore area for major news stories and weather reports). In 1948, however, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made Baltimore a separate media market. On March 29, 1948, WMAR-TV was announced as CBS' third full-time television affiliate, after WCBS-TV in New York City and WCAU-TV in Philadelphia.\n\nOne of WMAR's early local personalities was Jim McKay, who was the first voice heard when the station began its test broadcasts, and called the horse race program that inaugurated the station's official launch. McKay later moved over to CBS briefly before achieving greater fame on ABC as host of \"Wide World of Sports\" and Olympic coverage. Another was Helen Delich Bentley, a maritime editor for the \"Baltimore Sun\" who hosted \"The Port That Built a City\", a weekly review presenting maritime, shipping and transportation-related news. (Bentley later ran several times and was finally elected as the U.S. Representative from Maryland, serving several terms. By the 2010s, the Port of Baltimore was renamed symbolically for her.)\n\nIn 1959, WMAR-TV teamed up with WBAL-TV (channel 11) and WJZ-TV (channel 13) to build the world's first three-antenna candelabra tower. The new tower was built on the newly named \"Television Hill\" (formerly known as \"Malden Hill\") in the Woodberry neighborhood of Baltimore, which significantly improved the station's signal coverage well beyond Central Maryland. During the 1970s, the FCC tightened its cross-ownership rules, eventually barring common ownership between a newspaper and a television or radio station in the same city without a waiver. However, the combination of the \"Sunpapers\" and WMAR-TV was one of several that were \"grandfathered\" under these rules.\n\nOn March 3, 1981, CBS announced that it would be moving its affiliation to WBAL-TV, Baltimore's NBC station. Among its reasons for making the switch, CBS cited WMAR-TV's poor newscast ratings and frequent preemptions of network shows for syndicated programs, local specials, and sports coverage. While the station briefly considered becoming independent once again, channel 2 quickly cut a deal with NBC that May and Baltimore's first affiliation switch took place on August 30, 1981. The final CBS program to air on channel 2 before the switch was an NFL preseason game between the Houston Oilers and the Dallas Cowboys, airing live at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the night before the affiliation switch.\n\nOn March 1, 1982, after negotiations between WMAR-TV management and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) failed, all of the station's on-air talent, except one, went on strike. AFTRA members, joined by the Teamsters, the Communication Workers of America and other local unions, picketed the station's offices on York Road and Abell's offices at North Calvert and East Centre Streets. When color announcer (and long-time popular Baltimore Orioles third baseman) Brooks Robinson refused to cross the picket line at the start of the baseball season, the strike ended. The following day, both news anchors, Tom Sweeney and Curt Anderson, were fired.\n\nOn May 28, 1986, the A. S. Abell Company was purchased by the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company, the then-publisher of the \"Los Angeles Times\". With the loss of the grandfathered protection between the former Abell media properties, Times-Mirror opted to keep \"The Sunpapers\" and sold WMAR-TV (and WRLH-TV in Richmond) to Gillett Communications in July 1986. After filing for bankruptcy sometime later, Gillett restructured its television holdings into SCI Television, and in the early 1990s, SCI put WMAR-TV back on the market.\n\nThe Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company announced its purchase of the station in the summer of 1990, but in February 1991 the transfer was canceled after Scripps accused Gillett of misreporting WMAR's financial statements. Gillett then took legal action against Scripps, but both sides settled and the sale went forward. Scripps took control of the station in the spring of 1991. As this scenario was playing out, the Sinclair Broadcast Group, parent company of UHF station WBFF (channel 45), applied with the FCC for a new station on WMAR-TV's channel 2 allocation under a subsidiary called \"Four Jacks Broadcasting.\" If it were granted, it would have resulted in the entire WBFF intellectual unit (including its Fox network affiliation) moving from channel 45 to channel 2, with WBFF's existing channel 45 allocation sold. In the end, however, Scripps' license to operate WMAR-TV on channel 2 was reaffirmed by the FCC, and WBFF permanently remained on channel 45.\n\nIn June 1994, Scripps and ABC announced a long-term affiliation deal, which resulted in three Scripps-owned stations switching to ABC. WMAR-TV was included in the deal, and Channel 2 would displace Baltimore's longtime ABC affiliate, Westinghouse Broadcasting-owned WJZ-TV. ABC agreed to the deal as a condition of keeping its affiliation on Scripps' two biggest stations, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and WEWS in Cleveland; both of those outlets had been heavily wooed by CBS, which was about to lose its longtime Detroit and Cleveland affiliates to Fox as part of that network's affiliation deal with New World Communications. Locally, it triggered Baltimore's second network affiliation swap, which saw WMAR-TV switch to ABC, CBS move to WJZ-TV after concluding a groupwide affiliation deal with Westinghouse, and NBC return to WBAL-TV. The second switch occurred on January 2, 1995, with the FedEx Orange Bowl between the Miami Hurricanes and the Nebraska Cornhuskers being the final NBC program to air on channel 2. As a result, channel 2 became one of the few stations in the country to have been a primary affiliate with each of the \"Big Three\" networks.\nABC had been reluctant to drop its affiliation with WJZ-TV, which had been the highest-rated station in Baltimore for over a quarter-century and was one of the strongest ABC affiliates in the nation. In contrast, WMAR-TV had been a ratings also-ran for three decades. Indeed, ABC's ratings in Baltimore went into a steep decline after the switch, with a number of programs falling from first to third in the Baltimore ratings in one stroke.\n\nIn 1996, a year after the affiliation change, station management opted not to renew channel 2's carriage of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", deciding instead to take a chance on the new \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\". The move proved costly in the long term, as market leader WBAL-TV picked up \"Oprah\" until its 2011 end, and \"Rosie\" (which moved to WJZ-TV in late 2000) lasted only seven years. The switch resulted in a change of fortune between the two stations, with WBAL's 5:00–6:30 p.m. news block sustaining strong ratings, with WMAR having a sustained decline in the same timeslot.\n\nOn May 13, 2014, after a station security guard denied him entry into WMAR-TV's studio/offices, 28-year-old Vladimir Baptiste crashed a pickup truck into the building lobby–which was stolen around 12:00 p.m. from a Maryland State Highway Administration subcontractor. All of the station's approximately 120 employees were evacuated and the building was placed on lockdown as Baltimore County Police officers searched for the suspect. Channel 2 ran an automated feed of ABC programming for four hours, before going dark for about 80 minutes; a satellite relay with Phoenix sister station KNXV-TV was then established late that afternoon until WMAR master control operators were able to resume broadcasting from the studio. Police captured the man just after 4:30 p.m. that afternoon, as he was watching news coverage of the incident in one of the facility's offices. Officers found weapons in the truck, but there were no reports of gunshots being fired. No staffers inside the building were injured. Baptiste was taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation, and was later charged with three counts of attempted second degree murder.\n\nOn April 16, 2018, WMAR returned to a modernized version of its previous 70s-90s era stylized \"2\" logo, and a network-agnostic branding of \"WMAR 2\" to trade on the station's heritage.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWMAR-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to UHF channel 38, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2.\n\nAs a part of the repacking process following the 2016-2017 FCC incentive auction, WMAR-TV will relocate to UHF channel 27 on July 3, 2020, using PSIP to display its virtual channel number as 2.\n\nSyndicated programs seen on WMAR-TV include \"Rachael Ray\", \"Right This Minute\" (which is co-produced by WMAR's owner, Scripps), and \"The Doctors\". As an ABC affiliate, WMAR-TV now usually runs the network's entire lineup. The station was Baltimore's home to \"The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\" for nearly three decades until it moved to WNUV-TV (channel 54); in 2013, the telethon moved back to WMAR-TV, airing on ABC as the \"MDA Show of Strength\", for its final two years of its run.\n\nAs a CBS affiliate, WMAR-TV preempted an hour of the network's weekday morning daytime schedule, as well as CBS' late night programming. However, this was not a problem for Baltimore area viewers, as most of the area got a decent signal from WTOP-TV in Washington (now WUSA). From 1961 until 1980, the station was also co-owned with fellow CBS affiliate WBOC-TV in Salisbury.\n\nChannel 2 continued to preempt network programming as an NBC affiliate. \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" was not carried by WMAR-TV for several years in the mid-1980s as the station chose to air \"Thicke of the Night\", and later syndicated sitcom reruns following the 11:00 p.m. newscast. Some of the network's daytime programming was preempted as well. Both \"Tonight\" and preempted daytime programs were aired on then-independent stations WBFF and WNUV, though Baltimore viewers could also watch the entire NBC lineup on network-owned WRC-TV in Washington, along with affiliate WGAL-TV from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, whose signal was viewable in areas north of Baltimore County.\n\nUntil September 17, 2012 (upon the institution by Scripps of a company-wide effort at lower-cost original programming), \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\" aired on channel 2 from the beginning of their runs in 1984 and 1983 respectively. The two shows immediately moved to Fox affiliate WBFF, where they remain.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1993, channel 2 was the over-the-air flagship station of the Baltimore Orioles—long after most \"Big Three\" stations dropped local regular season sports coverage. In addition to Orioles games broadcast in-house by channel 2, WMAR-TV also aired all Orioles games via NBC's MLB broadcast contract from 1982 to 1989. Channel 2 served as the then-Baltimore Colts' station of record (through NBC's AFC broadcast contract) for three seasons from 1981 to 1983, before the team's controversial move to Indianapolis. As a CBS station, WMAR-TV first aired Colts games in 1956, when CBS obtained the broadcast rights to the pre-merger NFL; all Colts games were broadcast exclusively on channel 2 until 1969. From 1970 to 1980, with the Colts' move to the American Football Conference upon the completion of the AFL/NFL merger, WMAR then broadcast all Colts games in which they played host to an NFC team (when CBS assumed the broadcast contract to the post-merger NFC).\n\nWMAR-TV presently broadcasts 23½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4½ hours each weekday and one hour on Sundays); with regards to the amount of news programming, it is the lowest output among Baltimore's television stations. Unlike most news-producing ABC affiliates that are located in the Eastern Time Zone, WMAR does not air a newscast in the weekday midday timeslot; it also holds the distinction of being the largest news-producing \"Big Three\" station by market size that does not air any local newscasts on Saturdays (although WMAR does produce local weather cut-ins that are shown during the weekend edition of \"Good Morning America\").\n\nWMAR is also one of ten television stations that airs the \"Don't Waste Your Money\" series of consumer reports from John Matarese, based at Cincinnati sister station WCPO-TV. WMAR formerly operated a 24-hour local weather channel known as \"ABC 2 WeatherNet Digital\", which was also available on Comcast Xfinity digital cable channel 204 and streamed on the station's website; until 2012, the channel was also broadcast on a third digital subchannel of WMAR's over-the-air signal.\n\nDespite its newspaper roots and its status as the oldest television station in Maryland, WMAR's newscasts have been in last place among Baltimore's \"Big Three\" network affiliates since the early 1960s, and the station has not been a significant factor in the news ratings in over 30 years. This was the case even during the 1980s, with NBC's powerhouse primetime lineup as a lead-in.\n\nCurrently, WMAR's newscasts lag behind both WBAL-TV and WJZ-TV in the ratings by a wide margin, and has even trailed WBFF in some timeslots. For the past decade, WMAR and WBFF have formed one tier of local newscast ratings—significantly lower than the tier that is occupied by WBAL and WJZ. As such, it is currently one of ABC's weakest affiliates, especially in a top-50 market. By contrast, WJZ-TV dominated the ratings in the Baltimore market when it was affiliated with ABC before it switched to CBS.\n\nHowever, WMAR formerly boasted one of the most respected sports departments in the region, thanks in large part to the presence of longtime anchor and former Baltimore Ravens radio play-by-play announcer Scott Garceau. Garceau has since left to host a show on WJZ-FM and sports director Rob Carlin left for MSG Network, meaning WMAR's newscasts no longer have a separate sports anchor. Despite this, the station lays claim to the market's most aggressive coverage of local college and high school lacrosse, arguably the most popular sport in the area among young athletes. WMAR works in partnership with ESPNU to produce the \"ABC 2 Lacrosse Game of the Week\" during the college season, featuring prime matchups involving one or more Maryland lacrosse powerhouses, including Johns Hopkins University, Loyola College in Maryland, Towson University, the University of Maryland, College Park, and the U.S. Naval Academy. Garceau continues to do play-by-play for the station's lacrosse telecasts. Quint Kessenich, four-time lacrosse All-American with Johns Hopkins, is a major contributor to lacrosse coverage and appears sporadically as a fill-in anchor, host of the station's Baltimore Blast show and field reporter for select Ravens games.\n\nOn October 4, 2010, WMAR-TV became the last station in the market and the last Scripps-owned television station at the time to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition (Scripps has since acquired the television station group of McGraw-Hill; of those stations, one of them still produces its newscasts in pillarboxed standard definition as of January 2012). On April 18, 2011, WMAR became the first television station in Baltimore to expand its weekday morning newscast to the 4:30 a.m. timeslot.\n\n\n"}

It was included on \"The Smiths\" in February 1984 and as a B-side to the May 1984 single \"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\".\n\nThe song is about the Moors murders that took place on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Manchester, between 1963 and 1965. At the time of their deaths, many of the victims were only a few years older than Morrissey (born 1959), who wrote the lyrics of the song after reading a book about the murders, \"\" by Emlyn Williams.\n\n\"Suffer Little Children\" was one of the first songs that Morrissey and Johnny Marr wrote together.\nThe title of the song is a phrase found in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 19, verse 14, in which Jesus rebukes his disciples for turning away a group of children and says:\n\nAlthough five children were murdered in the Moors murders case, only three are named in the song: John Kilbride (\"oh John you'll never be a man\"), Lesley Ann Downey (\"Lesley Ann with your pretty white beads\"), and Edward Evans (\"Edward, see those alluring lights\"). The murders of Keith Bennett and Pauline Reade were not attributed to Myra Hindley and Ian Brady until 1985, after \"Suffer Little Children\" had already been released.\n\nThe phrase \"Hindley wakes and Hindley says; Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says: 'Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone'\" is likely a pun on the title of Hindle Wakes, a silent film which made use of location filming in Blackpool and Manchester.\n\nFirst released on \"The Smiths\" in February 1984, it was re-released in May as a B-side of the single \"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\". The \"Manchester Evening News\" reported that relatives of the Moors murder victims had taken exception to the lyrics, in which three of the victims are mentioned by name. Some newspapers also claimed that the single's sleeve photo of Viv Nicholson was intended to resemble Myra Hindley.\n\nSubsequently, Boots and Woolworths withdrew both the album and single from sale. Morrissey later established a friendship with Ann West, the mother of Moors victim Lesley Ann Downey, after she accepted that the band's intentions were honourable.\n\nThe song has been covered by several artists, including Hole throughout their 2010 tour.\n"}

As a designer for the Ballets Russes under Sergei Diaghilev, Benois exerted what is considered a seminal influence on the modern ballet and stage design.\n\nAlexandre was born into the artistic and intellectual Benois family, prominent members of the 19th- and early 20th-century Russian intelligentsia. His mother Camilla (ru: Камилла Альбертовна Кавос, and then Бенуа) was the granddaughter of Catterino Cavos. His father was Nicholas Benois, a noted Russian architect. His brothers included Albert, a painter, and Leon, also a notable architect. His sister, Maria, married the composer and conductor Nikolai Tcherepnin (with whom Alexandre would work). Not planning a career in the arts, Alexandre graduated from the Faculty of Law, Saint Petersburg Imperial University, in 1894.\n\nThree years later while in Versailles, Benois painted a series of watercolors depicting \"Last Promenades of Louis XIV\". When exhibited by Pavel Tretyakov in 1897, they brought him to attention of Sergei Diaghilev and the artist Léon Bakst. Together the three men founded the art magazine and movement \"Mir iskusstva\" (World of Art), which promoted the Aesthetic Movement and \"Art Nouveau\" in Russia.\n\nDuring the first decade of the new century, Benois continued to edit \"Mir iskusstva\", but also pursued his scholarly and artistic interests. He wrote and published several monographs on 19th-century Russian art and Tsarskoye Selo. In 1903, Benois printed his illustrations to Pushkin's poem \"The Bronze Horseman\", a work since recognized as one of the landmarks in the genre. In 1904, he published his \"Alphabet in Pictures\", at once a children's primer and elaborate art book, copies of which fetch as much as $10,000US at auction. Illustrations from this volume were featured at a video presentation during the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014.\n\nIn 1901, Benois was appointed scenic director of the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, the performance space for the Imperial Russian Ballet. He moved to Paris in 1905 and thereafter devoted most of his time to stage design and decor.\n\nDuring these years, his work with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes was groundbreaking. His sets and costumes for the productions of \"Les Sylphides\" (1909), \"Giselle\" (1910), and \"Petrushka\" (1911), are counted among his greatest triumphs. Although Benois worked primarily with the Ballets Russes, he also collaborated with the Moscow Art Theatre and other notable theatres of Europe.\n\nSurviving the upheaval of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Benois achieved recognition for his scholarship; he was selected as curator of the gallery of Old Masters in the Hermitage Museum at Leningrad, where he served from 1918 to 1926. During this time he secured his brother's heirloom Leonardo da Vinci painting of the \"Madonna\" for the museum. It became known as the \"Madonna Benois\". Benois published his \"Memoirs\" in two volumes in 1955.\n\nIn 1927 he left Russia and settled in Paris. He worked primarily as a set designer after settling in France.\n\nIn 1894, Alexandre married from a renowned Russian music family. They first met in 1876 when Alexandre was learning music from the family patriarch, Karl Ivanovich Kind (who came to Russia in 1850s by the invitation of Nicholas I of Russia to be the royal court's first string violinist). Anna and Alexandre were married for 60 years and are buried together at Batignolles Cemetery in Paris. Alexandre played a central role in the Russian artistic community both before and after the Revolution. Anna was always by his side. Her presence was positively remembered in the artistic circles with several mentions by artist like Mstislav Dobuzhinsky. She was a model painted by Léon Bakst, Valentin Serov, Zinaida Serebriakova, and others. \n\nNotable family members include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Esound is a small sound daemon for both Linux and UNIX. ESD was created to provide a consistent and simple interface to the audio device, so applications do not need to have different driver support written per architecture. It was also designed to enhance capabilities of audio devices such as allowing more than one application to share an open device. ESD accomplishes these things while remaining transparent to the application, meaning that the application developer can simply provide ESD support and let it do the rest. On top of this, the API is designed to be very similar to the current audio device API, making it easy to port to ESD.\n\nESD will mix the simultaneous audio output of multiple running programs, and output the resulting stream to the sound card.\n\nESD can also manage network-transparent audio. As such, an application that supports ESD can output audio over the network, to any connected computer that is running an ESD server.\n\nESD support must be specifically written and added into applications, as ESD does not emulate normal audio hardware APIs. Since ESD has been around for over a decade, earlier than almost any other sound server, a very large number of Unix applications have support for ESD output built-in, or available as add-ons.\n\nESD was maintained as part of the GNOME project, but as of April 2009, all ESD modules in GNOME have been ported to libcanberra for event sounds or GStreamer/PulseAudio for everything else.\n\nPulseAudio 2.0 completely drops ESounD support.\n\nEsound (ESD) is a stand-alone sound daemon that abstracts the system sound device to multiple clients. Under Linux using the Open Sound System (OSS), as well as other UNIX systems, typically only one process may open the sound device. This is not acceptable in a desktop environment like GNOME, as it is expected that many applications will be making sounds (music decoders, event based sounds, video conferencing, etc.). The ESD daemon connects to the sound device and accepts connections from multiple clients, mixing the incoming audio streams and sending the result to the sound device. Connections are only allowed to clients that can authenticate successfully, alleviating the concern that unauthorized users can eavesdrop via the sound device. In addition to accepting client connections from the local machine, ESD can be configured to accept client connections from remote hosts that authenticate successfully.\n\nApplications wanting to contact the ESD daemon do so using the libesd library. Much like with file i/o, an ESD connection is first opened. The ESD daemon will be spawned automatically by libesd if a daemon is not already present. Data is then either read or written to the ESD daemon. For an ESD client local to the machine that the ESD daemon is running on, the data is transferred through a local socket, then written to the sound device by the ESD daemon. For a client on a remote machine, the data is sent by libesd on the remote machine over the network to the ESD daemon. The process is completely transparent to the application using ESD.\n\n"}

{"id": "2065505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065505", "title": "String Quintet (Schubert)", "text": "String Quintet (Schubert)\n\nFranz Schubert's final chamber work, the String Quintet in C major (D. 956, Op. posth. 163) is sometimes called the \"Cello Quintet\" because it is scored for a standard string quartet plus an extra cello instead of the extra viola which is more usual in conventional string quintets. It was composed in 1828 and completed just two months before the composer's death. The first public performance of the piece did not occur until 1850, and publication occurred three years later in 1853. Schubert's only full-fledged string quintet, it has been praised as \"sublime\" or \"extraordinary\" and as possessing \"bottomless pathos,\" and is generally regarded as Schubert's finest chamber work as well as one of the greatest compositions in all chamber music.\n\nThe string quintet was composed in the summer or early autumn of 1828, at the same time as Schubert composed his last three piano sonatas and several of the Schwanengesang songs. Schubert completed it in late September or early October, just two months before his death. Schubert submitted it to one of his publishers, Heinrich Albert Probst, for consideration, saying that \"finally I have written a quintet for 2 violins, 1 viola, and 2 violoncelli ... the quintet rehearsal will only begin in the next few days. Should any of these compositions by any chance commend themselves to you, please let me know.\" Probst replied, asking only to see some of Schubert's vocal works and requesting more popular piano music. Even at this very late stage in Schubert's career, he was regarded as a composer who mainly focused on songs and piano pieces, and was definitely not taken seriously as a chamber music composer. The work remained unpublished at the time of Schubert's death in November 1828; the manuscript was sold to the Viennese publisher Diabelli by Schubert's brother Ferdinand shortly thereafter, but was neglected and indeed waited twenty-five years for its first publication in 1853. The manuscript and all sketches are now lost. The first known public performance occurred only three years earlier, on 17 November 1850 at the Musikverein in Vienna.\n\nThe work is the only full-fledged string quintet in Schubert's oeuvre. When he began composing his string quintet, Schubert had already composed an impressive body of chamber music for strings, including at least fifteen string quartets, most of which were composed for domestic performance by his family's string quartet.\n\nSchubert selected the key of C major in a possible gesture to two composers he greatly admired, Mozart and Beethoven, both of whom wrote string quintets in that key, Mozart's String Quintet No. 3 in C major, K. 515 and Beethoven's String Quintet, Op. 29 in C major. According to Charles Rosen, the opening theme of Schubert's work emulates many characteristics of the Mozart quintet's opening theme, such as decorative turns, irregular phrase lengths, and rising staccato arpeggios (the latter appear only in Schubert's recapitulation).\n\nBut whereas the string quintets of Mozart and Beethoven are composed for a string quartet augmented by a second viola, Schubert adopts a somewhat unconventional instrumentation, employing two cellos instead of two violas, creating richness in the lower register. Before Schubert, Luigi Boccherini had replaced the second viola with a second cello; however, Schubert's use of the second cello is very different from Boccherini's, who uses the additional cello to create an additional viola line. Alfred Einstein has proposed that Schubert's use of a second cello to enhance the lower strings may have been suggested by George Onslow, who used a double bass in some of his quintets.\n\nThe string quintet consists of four movements in the usual quick-slow-scherzo-quick pattern:\n\nIn common with other late Schubert works (notably, the symphony in C major, D. 944, the piano sonata in B-flat major, D. 960, and the string quartet in G major, D. 887), the quintet opens with an extremely expansive movement: an \"Allegro ma non troppo\" that accounts for more than one third of the total length of the piece (typically, 50 minutes). The movement is notable for its unexpected harmonic turns. The exposition, lasting 154 bars, begins with an expansive C major chord: as in the G major quartet, D. 887, Schubert here \"presents his harmonies—rather than a memorable, well-contoured melody—without a regular rhythmic pulse.\" This is followed by music of gradually increasing motion and tension, leading to the contrasting second subject, in the unexpected key of E-flat, introduced as a duet between the two celli. The exposition concludes with a dominant (G major) chord that leads naturally back to the opening tonic chord on the repeat. However, after the repeat of the exposition, Schubert begins the development section with a daring modulation from the dominant to the submediant that \"lift[s] the music magically\" from G major to A major.\n\nThe \"sublime\" second movement, one of Schubert's rare adagios, is in three-part ABA (ternary) form. The outer sections, in E major, are of an otherworldly tranquility, while the central section is intensely turbulent: it breaks suddenly into the tranquility in the distant key of F minor. When the opening music returns, there is a running 32nd-note passage in the second cello which seems to have been motivated by the turbulence that came before it. In the last three measures of the movement, Schubert somehow contrives to tie the entire movement together harmonically with a modulation to the F minor of the middle section and an immediate return to E major.\n\nThe use of ternary structure to contrast tranquil outer sections with a turbulent central section resembles the second movement of Schubert's Piano Sonata in A major, D. 959, composed at the same time as the quintet.\n\nThe juxtaposition of E major and F minor, exceedingly distantly related keys, establishes the importance of the \"tonal relationship of lowered second degree\" (or flat supertonic) \"to the tonic\" which will be exploited in the third and fourth movements.\n\nThe Scherzo, beginning in C major, is symphonic and large-scaled, with the open strings of the lower instruments exploited in an innovative manner that creates a volume of sound seemingly beyond the capabilities of five stringed instruments. The first section moves to A major and then back to C major. The middle section of this movement moves to E major, then B major, which is VI of III. The C major theme returns at the end. The Trio is in D-flat major, creating another important flat-supertonic relationship.\n\nThe last movement is an exuberant sonata-rondo whose form resembles that of the finale of Mozart's C major quintet The main theme demonstrates clear Hungarian influences. The movement is in C major, but is built upon the interplay of the major and minor modes. It has unusual technical features, such as the final two notes: the flat supertonic (D-flat) and the tonic (C), played \"forte\" in all parts.\n\nAfter Schubert's string quintet was belatedly premiered and published in the 1850s, it gradually gained recognition as a masterpiece.\n\nAn early admirer was Brahms whose Piano Quintet (1865) was inspired in part by Schubert's (then) newly discovered work. Brahms, in fact, originally wrote that work as a string quintet with two cellos (the complement used by Schubert) and only later recast it as a piano quintet. The piano quintet is in F minor, the key of the turbulent central section of Schubert's \"Adagio\", while the third movement recalls the C minor/major of Schubert's Quintet, and that movement ends in the same manner as Schubert's finale, with strong emphasis on the flat supertonic D-flat, before the final tonic C.\n\nCurrent consensus holds that the Quintet represents a high point in the entire chamber repertoire.\n\nAlthough there is no reason to believe Schubert expected to die so soon after composing the work, the fact that the quintet was completed a mere two months before his death has inspired some listeners to hear in it a valedictory or death-haunted quality. For John Reed, the quintet prefigures Schubert's death, ending as it does with D-flat followed by C, both in unison and octaves: \"As Browning's Abt Vogler put it, 'Hark, I have dared and done, for my resting place is found, The C major of this life; so, and now I will try to sleep.'\" The violinist Joseph Saunders had the second theme of the first movement carved on his tombstone; Arthur Rubinstein's wish was to have the second movement played at his funeral.\n\nThe second movement's plaintive mood makes it popular as background music for pensive or nocturnal scenes in film. Examples include \"Nocturne Indien\", \"Conspiracy\", \"The Human Stain\", and Jim Jarmusch's \"The Limits of Control\". Also, Episode 21 from the Inspector Morse television series (\"Dead on Time\") draws extensively from this quintet, as does Episode 16 (\"Lazaretto\") of its prequel Endeavour, and certain episodes in Desmond Morris's BBC series \"The Human Animal\".\n\nSchubert's string quintet has often been recorded. The first recording was made by the Cobbett Quartet in 1925. Two recordings from the early 1950s are widely cited as legendary: a 1952 performance featuring Isaac Stern and Alexander Schneider, violins; Milton Katims, viola; and Pablo Casals and Paul Tortelier, cellos; and a 1951 performance by the Hollywood String Quartet with Kurt Reher on second cello (a 1994 CD reissue of this performance was awarded a Gramophone Award).\n\nAmong modern recordings, that featuring the Melos Quartet with Mstislav Rostropovich (1977) has been acclaimed, and is notable for the exceptionally slow tempo adopted for the Adagio. Rostropovich later recorded the quintet with the Emerson String Quartet (12/1990) on the occasion of the gala concert celebrating the 125th anniversary of the BASF AG, Ludwigshafen. A few recordings of the quintet performed on period instruments exist, including a 1990 recording on the Vivarte label with the following lineup: Vera Beths and Lisa Rautenberg, violins; Steven Dann, viola; and Anner Bylsma and Kenneth Slowik, cellos.\n\n"}

In Anne Frank's posthumously published diary, \"The Diary of a Young Girl\", he was referred to under the name Mr. Kraler.\n\nBorn in Hohenelbe (now Vrchlabí) in the German-speaking part of Königgrätz region (Královéhradecký kraj/Hradec Králové Region), north-eastern Bohemia, Austria-Hungary to Emma Kugler. (Now in the Czech Republic), he joined the Austro-Hungarian Navy during the First World War once his education was completed, but was discharged in 1918 after being wounded. He moved to Germany and worked as an electrician, then in 1920, Kugler moved to Utrecht, the Netherlands, to work for a company selling pectin. He joined the Amsterdam branch of Opekta as Otto Frank's deputy in 1924. He became a Dutch citizen in May 1938. In 1940, this allowed him to prevent the Nazi confiscation of Opekta and he accepted the directorship of the business, renamed Gies and Co, from Otto Frank. He and his wife, Laura Maria Buntenbach-Kugler (10 May 1895 – 6 December 1952), lived in Hilversum during the war, a distance of about from Amsterdam.\n\nFrom July 1942 to August 1944, he aided his colleagues Miep Gies, Johannes Kleiman and Bep Voskuijl in the concealment of eight people, including Anne Frank, in a sealed-off annex in their office premises on Amsterdam's Prinsengracht. He was arrested by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, by Karl Silberbauer.\n\nHe was interrogated at the Gestapo Headquarters on the Euterpestraat, then transferred the same day to a prison for Jews and 'political prisoners' awaiting deportation on the Amstelveenseweg. On 7 September, he was moved to the prison on Weteringschans, in a cell with people sentenced to death. This was followed, four days later on September 11, by a transport to a concentration camp in Amersfoort where he was selected for transport to Germany. On 17 September, the Amersfoort train station was destroyed in a bombing (Arnhem Air Raid) and on 26 September, he and around 1100 other men were taken to Zwolle for forced labour, digging anti-tank trenches.\nKugler was moved again on 30 December 1944, to Wageningen for forced labour digging under the German S.A. (Brownshirts or Storm Troopers) until 28 March 1945, when some 600 prisoners were marched from Wageningen through Renkum, Heelsum, Oosterbeek, Arnhem, and Westervoort, to Zevenaar with the intention of going on to Germany the following day. There was a bombing raid during the march and Kugler took advantage of the confusion to escape. He was hidden by a farmer for a few days, borrowed a bicycle and made his way back to Hilversum, where he lived, and which he reached in April 1945. He hid there in his own house until the liberation of the Netherlands on 5 May 1945.\n\nHis wife, Laura Kugler, died on 6 December 1952 and three years later he married Lucie (Loes) van Langen. The couple moved to Canada, where the brother, sister and mother of Lucie already resided. On 16 September 1958, Kugler appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show \"To Tell The Truth\".\n\nIn 1973, he received the Yad Vashem Medal of the Righteous among the Nations and in 1977 the Canadian Anti-Defamation League awarded him a 10,000 dollar prize in recognition of his assistance in the hiding of the Frank and Van Pels families.\n\n\n"}

Sarah Archer, daughter and eventual co-heiress of the 2nd Baron Archer. He was the sixth Earl of Plymouth of the 1682 creation.\n\nHe was born the only son, and had two sisters Lady Mary Windsor, who married the Marquess of Downshire and Lady Harriet Windsor, who married the Hon. Robert Clive, a son of the Earl of Powis and grandson of Clive of India.\n\nStyled Lord Windsor from birth, he inherited his titles from his father on 12 June 1799 at the age of ten, along with his father's land at Tardebigge, the country seat Hewell Grange, and land in Shropshire and Glamorgan. A year later (1800), his mother married Lord Amherst as his first wife, and bore him two sons. It is not clear if young Plymouth grew up with his stepfather (but highly likely); if so, he was exposed to the influences of Amherst's wide-ranging Court and political connections, culminating in his failed (1816) embassy to China. Plymouth was educated at Harrow.\n\nHe married Lady Mary Sackville (1792–1864), elder daughter of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, on 5 August 1811. There was no issue of the marriage, and Lady Plymouth later married his stepfather Lord Amherst (after his wife Plymouth's mother died in 1838). Since Plymouth was richer than his brother-in-law De La Warr (1791–1869), his mother-in-law Arabella, Duchess of Dorset and Countess Whitworth, left Knole in 1825 to her elder daughter Mary, on the grounds that her husband could better afford the annual upkeep of the house. By 1829–30, the Countesses of Plymouth and De La Warr (or rather, their husbands) had partitioned the Sackville family estates between them.\n\nLord Plymouth was admitted to the House of Lords probably at the usual age of 21, although he was not active in politics. He voted against the first Reform Bill on 8 October 1831 along with the majority of the House of Lords. He was involved in the creation of the Worcester Yeomanry Division which fought in Spain. At his death, he was Colonel of the Worcestershire Yeomanry Cavalry.\n\nAlso during his tenure, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was built through Tardebigge (Tardebeck, Worcestershire) and good taxes were collected from the nailmakers of Redditch. The canal passes very close to Hewell Grange (now a state prison) and was finished ten years after Windsor inherited his father's title. The canal was finished in 1799; however the reservoirs were built twenty years later, and finished in 1836. Windsor bought Barnt Green House from the tenant Yates family who had resided there for some years.\n\nPlymouth died on board his yacht, aged 44, at Deptford. During the night, he suffered an attack of apoplexy, and despite medical aid, died in the afternoon. He was buried in the family vault at St Bartholomew's Church in Tardebigge (then also called Tardebeck), Worcestershire. He is commemorated by an obelisk bearing his name, situated in the Lickey Hills Country Park and visible from Bromsgrove. His unusual forename 'Other' is traditional in the family and derives from a legendary Viking ancestor 'Otho' or 'Othere'.\n\nAt his death, Plymouth was succeeded in the earldom by his bachelor uncle the Hon. & Rev. Andrew Windsor (b. 1764) who died unmarried in 1837. The earldom passed to the 7th Earl's youngest brother (youngest surviving son of the 4th Earl) after which the earldom became extinct in 1843.\n\nThe 6th Earl's death without issue meant that the Windsor barony (1529) fell into abeyance between his two sisters, until it was called out of abeyance in 1855 in favour of the younger sister Lady Harriet Clive, who became Harriet Windsor-Clive and whose sons Robert and George also took the name Windsor-Clive. Harriet's grandson Robert Windsor-Clive, 14th Baron Windsor was created Earl of Plymouth in 1905 (third creation), and is the grandfather of the present Earl (b. 1923). Since the present Earl is the owner of the estates held by the 6th Earl, those might have descended by the 6th Earl's will to his younger sister Harriet and her heirs male.\n\n"}

Mary herself was active in the ULFTA's youth movement and worked as a YCL organiser. She was active in the Communist Party's predecessor, the Labor-Progressive Party, before becoming \"an important [Communist] Party worker in Manitoba\". Kardash became secretary of the Winnipeg branch of the Canadian-Soviet Friendly Society. She travelled to Moscow in 1949 as part of the Canadian delegation from the Congress of Canadian Women to the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF), a post-war international for Communist bloc country's women's organizations.\n\nAs one of a group of long-lived Winnipeg communist municipal politicians, after several attempts, Kardash was first elected to the Winnipeg school board in 1960, and she served as a member intermittently until 1986, being elected as a Communist Party of Canada candidate. She supported radical reform and particularly programs to support aboriginal children, notably during a period of Conservative rule in Manitoba from the late 1970s. It was her retirement from the Winnipeg school board in the late 1980s that ended several decades of Communist representation in the city.\n\nMary met her future husband, Bill Kardash, in 1939 and they married in March 1940, later having two children, Ted and Nancy. Bill was also a Communist leader and represented the party in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1941 to 1958. Mary ran in north Winnipeg as a Communist candidate for the Manitoba legislature in the 1973 provincial election, and for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1974 federal election, but won only a few hundred votes in both attempts.\n\nIn the 1980s, Mary Kardash courted controversy by questioning the generally accepted account of Ukrainian famine and opposing a proposal that the history of the famine be included in the educational curriculum. The Communist Party acknowledged that many Ukrainians died by famine in the early 1930s, but they and she denied that Joseph Stalin's government was responsible for an act of genocide.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mary and Bill Kardash resisted attempts to wind up the Communist Party of Canada. Kardash died in the mid-1990s. The St. Cross Child Care Centre of Winnipeg was renamed the Mary Kardash Child Care Centre in her honour in 1995.\n"}

The character has become one of the most recognizable horror icons, often mentioned alongside Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Ghostface, Leatherface, Pennywise, Pinhead, Jigsaw and Michael Myers, and has been referenced numerous times in popular culture. In 1999, the Chucky character was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for the film \"Bride of Chucky\". He was created by writer-director Don Mancini and is portrayed by Brad Dourif in both live action and voice over. For the 2019 remake of the same name, Mark Hamill voiced Chucky, having previously voiced the Charles Lee Ray version of the character in an episode of \"Robot Chicken\".\n\nChucky made his first appearance in the 1988 film \"Child's Play\".

Now living in the form of the animated doll, Chucky (voiced by Dourif) is given to young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) and begins terrorizing the family.\n\nChucky made his second appearance in the 1990 sequel, \"Child's Play 2\". In the film, a resurrected Chucky continues his pursuit of Andy, who has been placed in foster care after the events of the first film.\n\nIn \"Child's Play 3\" (1991), Chucky again returns from the grave eight years after the events of the previous film to terrorize a now teenage Andy (Justin Whalin) who is currently in a military academy\n\n\"Bride of Chucky\" (1998) continues the story, with Chucky being resurrected by former accomplice and girlfriend Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly).

The film takes place twenty-five years after the events of the first film, as Chucky torments Nica Pierce (Fiona Dourif).\n\nIn \"Cult of Chucky\" (2017), Chucky returns to torment a now institutionalized Nica, while a now adult Andy (Vincent) attempts to stop Chucky's plans once and for all.\n\nIn the 2019 remake of \"Child's Play\", Chucky (voiced by Mark Hamill) is presented as a high-tech artificially-intelligent Buddi doll created by the Kaslan Corporation. Primarily designed to be a life-long companion to its owner by learning from its surroundings and acting accordingly, Buddi dolls can also connect to and operate other Kaslan products. One such doll has its safety precautions disabled by a disgruntled Kaslan employee during the assembly process, and as a result, Chucky gradually develops murderous tendencies as he tries to eliminate anyone or anything who's stopping him and his \"best buddy\" Andy Barclay (Gabriel Bateman) from staying best friends forever.\n\n\"Child's Play\" creator and co-writer Don Mancini explained that Chucky draws heavily from the My Buddy dolls: \"In my original script, he was originally called Buddy, and we couldn't use it because of the 'My Buddy' doll. The director went out and got a 'My Buddy' doll, a Raggedy Ann, a Raggedy Andy and one of those life-size baby infants. What I told [designer] Kevin Yagher was, I wanted something similar to a My Buddy doll. I described \"Buddy\" in my original script, now \"Chucky\", as wearing red-buttoned overalls, red sneakers, striped sweater, with red hair, blue eyes, and freckles. Kevin went off and sketched many designs of Chucky, until the final was picked. Yagher then built the first doll from those sketches and my details\".\n\n"}

The parish was renamed from Rampton to Rampton and Woodbeck on the 1st of April 2018.\n\nThe 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 1,139.\n\nThe toponym \"Rampton\" is probably derived from Old English \"Ramm-tūn\", meaning \"farmstead where rams are kept\".\n\nThe village was an important manor from Norman times. The old manor house was pulled down around 1720, having been held by the Stanhope and Babington families.

{"id": "2065584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065584", "title": "PlayTape", "text": "PlayTape\n\nPlayTape is a audiotape format and mono or stereo playback system introduced in 1966 by Frank Stanton. It is a two-track system, and was launched to compete with existing 4-track cartridge technology. The cartridges play anywhere from eight to 24 minutes, and are continuous. Because of its portability, PlayTape was an almost instant success, and over 3,000 artists had published in this format by 1968. White cases usually meant about eight songs were on the tape.\n\nAt the time of PlayTape's launch, vinyl records reigned supreme, and Earl Muntz's Stereo-Pak (based on the broadcast \"Fidelipac\" cartridge system) was also a popular sound delivery system. His car players were offered with stereo sound. Bill Lear's 8-track tape system, though in production, had not yet achieved its market potential. Moreover, neither Lear or Muntz was offering a portable player, though Muntz eventually did sell one.\n\nWhile PlayTape found some success in reaching the youth audience, it was not as successful in targeting the business market. Stanton marketed his device as a dictation machine, but he was unable to persuade businesses to adopt his creation. Issues of player quality limited sales, and ultimately, the introduction of home and portable players by the 4-track and 8-track manufacturers led to the demise of PlayTape.\n\nOnly a handful of small compact players, and a few very rare car players were sold to the open market. In the United States, Volkswagen was the only manufacturer to offer a PlayTape player as optional equipment. They are collectors' items today.\n\nVolkswagen saw a market opportunity in the U.S. for automotive audio players in 1968. Frank Stanton, president of PlayTape, announced that Motorola would manufacture an automotive player in OEM and aftermarket models for Volkswagen. The \"Sapphire I\" OEM model was designed for in-dash installation, and included an AM radio. The \"Sapphire II\" aftermarket version omitted the radio, and was designed to hang from the dashboard. The price for either unit was said to be about US $40, (today US $).\n\nStanton also claimed that VW dealers would carry about 250 PlayTape titles for sale, and that some Volkswagen dealers would also sell the full line of PlayTape home and portable players. \"We feel that Volkswagen salesmen will be able to interest the purchaser of a Sapphire I player in a complementary model for his home,\" Stanton said.\n\nIn 1967 Smith Corona (SCM) used this cartridge format for the \"Mail Call\", a device which contained the PlayTape drive and its design looked a little like a telephone and used blank tape PlayTape cartridges, offered in capacities of 3, 6 and 10 minutes of recording time to be sent as voice letters with inexpensive shipping cost. The ends of the tape loop were fixed by an adhesive tape which also got a conductive top to prevent overwriting the same recording. \n\nIn 1967, an AT&T 10-minute long-distance call in the US was $5.50 without tax ($, adjusted for inflation). A three-minute international call was $12.

According to one obituary, he was best known for \"playing gentle, boyish young men from the country.\" Another said he \"had an ingenuous appeal that made him a favourite of family audiences, and was particularly at home in outdoor settings featuring dogs and horses. Ultimately his perennial boyishness and slight stature became a handicap for more mature roles.\"\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Lon McCallister was the son of a real estate broker. He attended Marken Professional School, which trained children for show-business careers and began appearing in movies at the age of 13. He had uncredited appearances in \"Let's Sing Again\" (1936) and \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1936), directed by George Cukor who, gave McAllister a large close up, and became a friend. \n\nHe was uncredited in \"Stella Dallas\" (1937), \"Souls at Sea\" (1937), \"Make a Wish\" (1937), \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" (1938), \"Judge Hardy's Children\" (1938), \"Lord Jeff\" (1938), \"That Certain Age\" (1938), \"Little Tough Guys in Society\" (1939), \"The Spirit of Culver\" (1939), \"Confessions of a Nazi Spy\" (1939), \"Babes in Arms\" (1939), \"First Love\" (1939), and \"Joe and Ethel Turp Call on the President\" (1939).\n\nMcCallister could also be glimpsed in \"Susan and God\" (1940), \"Henry Aldrich for President\" (1941), \"Dangerously They Live\" (1941), \"Always in My Heart\" (1942), \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942), \"Spy Ship\" (1942), \"Night in New Orleans\" (1942), \"That Other Woman\" (1942), \"Gentleman Jim\" (1942), \"Quiet Please: Murder\" (1942), \"Over My Dead Body\" (1942), \"The Hard Way\" (1943), and \"The Meanest Man in the World\" (1943).

His father was a lawyer who studied under Richard Stockton Field. He came from a historic New Jersey political family. His paternal grandparents were John Frederick Frelinghuysen (1776–1833), a lawyer and brigadier general in the War of 1812, and his second wife, Elizabeth Mercereau Van Vechten. His great-grandparents were Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen (1753-1804), lawyer, soldier, and Senator from New Jersey, and his first wife, Gertrude Schenck (1752/53-1794).\n\nAfter fighting in the Spanish–American War and starting an insurance business, Frelinghuysen was elected to the state Senate in 1905 and became president of that body in 1909. He held several statewide offices before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1916. He was New Jersey's first directly elected senator following ratification of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913. While in the Senate, he frequented the Chevy Chase Club and would often golf with his fellow Senators Warren G. Harding, Stephen B. Elkins, and Eugene Hale.\n\nIn 1921, President Warren G. Harding signed the Knox–Porter Resolution, officially ending America's involvement in World War I at Frelinghuysen's estate in Raritan, New Jersey. The President stayed on the estate until at least July 4. After a failed reelection bid in 1922, Frelinghuysen returned to the insurance business.\n\nIn 1938, after considering a run for one of the United State Senate seats in New Jersey, Frelinghuysen declined to run. Instead, he put his support behind fellow Republican, former Senator W. Warren Barbour, for the Republican nomination. Barbour eventually won the Senate seat and served until his death in 1943.\n\nFrelinghuysen married Emily Macy Brewster (1881-1967) who was born in Rochester, New York. Together they had three children:\nHis wife's portrait and that of Joseph Jr, were painted in 1916 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury; it is today in the Newark Museum, New Jersey. Frelinghuysen owned an 88-foot houseboat called \"Victoria\" that Harding used for 12 days after he won the 1920 election for President, but before he was inaugurated in March 1921.\n\nHe died on February 8, 1948 in Tucson, Arizona, and was interred at St. Bernard's Cemetery in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\n\nA memorial plaque was placed on the estate grounds commemorating the Knox–Porter Resolution officially ending America's involvement in World War I. Today the estate is long gone and suburban sprawl has replaced it with mini-malls. The marker remains in a patch of grass near a Burger King parking lot along Route 28, just north of the Somerville traffic circle.\n\n"}

He won the Vuelta a España in 2013, becoming the oldest winner of any of cycling's grand tours in the process.\n\nHorner turned professional in 1995 with the PAA–NutraFig team. He captured his first major victory in a stage win of the Tour DuPont in 1996.\n\nHe was then asked to ride in Europe with French team . From 1997 to 1999 he had three frustrating seasons with this team.\n\nIn 2000 Horner returned to America to resume a record-setting domestic career, riding with Mercury in 2000, Prime Alliance in 2002, Saturn in 2003 and Webcor Builders in 2004. Horner has won almost every important race in the US racing calendar, with the notable exception of the USPRO National Championships.\n\nHorner decided to move to after his top-ten finish in the 2004 UCI Road World Championships because he wanted to give the Tour de France a try. After being injured in the beginning of 2005, Horner showed strong performance in the USPRO Championships and won his first major European victory by taking the sixth stage of the 2005 Tour de Suisse. He then earned his place on the 2005 Tour de France team and nearly won the Miramas to Montpellier stage when he and Sylvain Chavanel refused to cooperate in the final kilometers and were caught by the peloton.\n\nHe made a move to the Belgian UCI ProTour squad for the 2006 season.\n\nFor 2007 Horner signed with Ed Krall Racing for the cyclo-cross season.\n\nIn 2008 Horner moved to .

He and his RadioShack teammates did well at the Tour of California, with Horner putting on a particularly strong performance in the last stage of the race as a member of a final breakaway at Thousand Oaks. Horner finished fourth overall, 64 seconds behind winner Michael Rogers, and just 39 seconds behind teammate Levi Leipheimer in overall time. His good form also resulted in a 9th place overall at the Tour de France, as the first-placed American rider, in spite of dedicating himself in the first stages to supporting his captain Lance Armstrong.\n\nIn 2011 Horner continued his success at the Tour of the Basque Country with a second-place finish, as well as 4th at the Volta a Catalunya. Horner then accomplished another high-profile result by winning May's Tour of California stage race. He scored a major solo victory on the 4th stage, after making significant time gains on the day's final mountain finish in San Jose. He maintained his hold on the yellow jersey until the tour's queen stage, where he completed a two-man breakaway finish with teammate Levi Leipheimer to finalize the overall lead, and at age 39 became the oldest rider in history to win that tour.

Horner's success at that race continued and he won the race overall on September 15, 2013, the oldest ever Grand Tour winner..\n\nHe left at the end of the season, as his contract expired. He felt he was worth more than the team were willing to offer for a rider of his resume and ability.\n\nHorner joined for the 2014 season. In April, while training in Italy for the Giro d'Italia, he was hit by a car driver who subsequently fled the scene. Horner suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs in the accident, jeopardizing his participation at the Giro d'Italia.

However, Horner withdrew from the Vuelta ahead of the first stage due to his cortisol levels dropping below the threshold considered healthy by the Mouvement pour un cyclisme crédible, of which Lampre–Merida is a member. The announcement followed Horner's usage of cortisone on prescription under a therapeutic use exemption to treat a case of bronchitis.\n\nLampre–Merida opted not to extend Horner's contract, and in December 2014 he announced he had signed a deal with UCI Continental team for 2015.\n\nIn June 2018, Horner returned to racing for the United States National Road Race Championships, riding for .

Baron Blood attacked her, and the original Human Torch rescued her. She was revealed to have been bitten by Baron Blood, who abducted her again; this time she was rescued by Captain America. She received a transfusion of artificial blood from the Human Torch, which endowed her with superhuman speed. She used these new powers to save the Torch from the Blue Bullet. She became an adventurer and took the name Spitfire and joined the Invaders, and went on her first mission with the Invaders. She operated as a special agent for the United Kingdom and Allied Forces during World War II, as well as the United Kingdom's Home Guard.\n\nWith the Invaders, she parachuted into Nazi Germany. She was captured by the Nazis, and was about to be executed when she was rescued by Union Jack. She battled Warrior Woman, and escaped from Germany with the Invaders. With the Invaders, she fought the Teutonic Knight, and helped prevent the assassination of Winston Churchill by Baron Von Strucker. Alongside the Invaders, she clashed with Master Man, and freed the Mighty Destroyer from captivity. After some time off, she returned to active duty with the Invaders. At the war's end, Jacqueline retired from costumed activity.\n\nAfter the war Lady Falsworth, her brother and her father assisted a secret organization called V-Battalion up until her brother's death in a car accident in 1953. Around this time she married a British nobleman, Lord Crichton, and together they had a son, Kenneth Crichton. She also became the Chief-Executive-Officer of Falsworth Industries. During this period, her super-speed faded as she grew older\n\nShe was present during Captain America's final battle with the original Baron Blood at Falsworth Manor, during this battle her son's friend Joey Chapman took over the role as Union Jack. Following the death of her father in the aftermath of the incident, she reluctantly agreed to allow Chapman to continue in the role of Union, formerly held by her father and brother. Although she had dismissed the idea of putting on her costume to assist Captain America defeat Baron Blood, she was able to summon her super-speed for the first time in a decade to save a nurse at the hospital where she was receiving treatment from a mutant ex-boyfriend.\n\nJacqueline later aided Namorita and Union Jack in a mission to rescue Namor from the original Master Man and Warrior Woman, during which she was shot. She received another life-saving blood transfusion from the Human Torch which not only restored her youth and powers, but also established a psychic link between her and the Torch. After going public to explain her rejuvenation in the media, her son Kenneth was kidnapped by Selene, who wished to vivisect her to learn the secret of eternal youth; but as Spitfire she was able to rescue Kenneth just as the bomb he had been strapped to was triggered.\n\nWhile planning a Christmas party at Falsworth Manor, Jacqueline called for a doctor to care for her ailing son, Kenneth, but ignored warnings from Union Jack, Joey Chapman, that he was being led down a dark path. The Christmas party was disrupted by a vampire cult led by Baroness Blood, and when the cult set off a bomb, Jacqueline used her powers to rescue Chapman from the explosion. Jacqueline spent the next eight months mourning the death of her son who had been seduced, turned into the new Baron Blood and ultimately left to die by the Baroness.\n\nShe later joined the New Invaders, but resigned with most of the other members after the Torch's death. She also had a brief relationship with Chapman, but they broke up due to the large age difference.\n\nShe joins MI-13 as part of Britain's response to the Secret Invasion by the Skrull Empire. She befriends, and later suffers the loss of 'John', a Skrull that had been on earth for decades and was fighting for England. In battle with two Super-Skrulls, Spitfire rips out their throats with her teeth, displaying vampire traits from her Baron Blood bite that have been previously unseen. \"Captain Britain and MI13\" writer Paul Cornell commented on her new traits, stating that:\n\nEven Spitfire herself shows some reservations about using her vampiric powers, as seen in the aforementioned attack on the Super-Skrulls:\n\nWhen new MI13 recruit and vampire hunter Blade first meets Spitfire, he stakes her. She survives only thanks to the powers of fellow MI13 member Faiza Hussain and later begins a romantic relationship with Blade. During Dracula's attack on Britain, Jacqueline's vampire son Kenneth visited her and led her into a trap, where Dracula magically forced her into servitude. While she initially resisted, it seemed that he was eventually able to convince her to become one of his minions; it was later revealed that Spitfire has been a double-agent the whole time, always helping Wisdom in gaining intelligence on Dracula's whereabouts.\n\nAs part of the \"Marvel NOW!\" event, Spitfire was seen assisting Captain Britain in running the Braddock Academy (the British answer to the Avengers Academy).\n\nJacqueline received superhuman powers as a result of a mutagenic reaction to a vampiric bite by the original Baron Blood, and a subsequent transfusion of artificial blood from the original Human Torch. As Spitfire, she possesses the ability to run at lightning-fast speeds, with reflexes, reactions, coordination, agility, and endurance to match. When she runs, a trail of non-damaging fire appears behind her. She can create cyclones by running in circles, and can run up walls and across water. Her skin is also hardened to withstand the rigors of such speed, providing a type of body armor, and her costume is synthetic stretch fabric chemically treated for protection from friction and other hazards of superhuman speed.\n\nIn the years after World War II, as Spitfire aged she ceased the use of her superhuman speed. Due to a second transfusion of artificial blood from the original Human Torch, Spitfire today has the body of a teenage girl, although she is chronologically many decades older. Her hair was originally still white from age, but it began turning blonde again.\n\nIt is said by the mutant sorceress, Selene, that Spitfire seems to possess a mutant regenerative power triggered by her transfusion of synthetic blood. With intensive study of her metabolism, blood stream, and glandular system, Selene hoped to one day duplicate the process.\n\nShe has some vampire abilities including fangs that appear when she is angry. However, she feels no blood lust and has no need to drink blood.

Historically, Claremont was part of Pickering Township, Ontario County, Ontario until 1974 when Ontario County was amalgamated into the Regional Municipality of Durham established at that time.\n\nIt is one of many rural villages with suburban type housing mixed with older, historic buildings in the Greater Toronto Area. Brock Road, the main north-south Regional road in the area was realigned to bypass the village to the east in 1970. Claremont is situated just below the Oak Ridges Moraine in the Greenbelt. Typical of the moraine countryside, around 50 to 70% of the land area around Claremont is forested. The remaining land around the village is wooded farmland and streams.\n\nUntil the establishment of regional government in 1974, the municipal offices of the former Township of Pickering were located in Claremont.\n\nAccess to and traffic through Claremont increased greatly with the completion of the eastern extension of the Highway 407 highway, terminating at the Brock Road exit which opened in 2001.\n\nThe Havelock Subdivision of the Canadian Pacific Railway runs through Claremont. This line is used for freight traffic, but there have been proposals for the return of passenger service as part of a GO Transit expansion to Peterborough.\n\nClaremont is located 20 km northwest of Oshawa and about 55 km northeast of Downtown Toronto.\n\n\nIn 1972, the Government of Canada expropriated 7,530 ha of land just west of Claremont for a possible future airport.\n\nIndeed, by the late-1990s, the Greater Toronto Airport Authority (GTAA) there were plans initiated to build an international Airport in Pickering which would be constructed to relieve congestion at Pearson International Airport, located some 70 km to the southwest. This new airport was also going to become the main cargo facility for the Greater Toronto Area.\n\nBut air traffic at Pearson declined in the years to follow and is only slowly returning (although it has not reached) to previous passenger volumes.\n\nAlso, terminal expansion at Pearson and the massive Cargo infield development by the GTAA have further delayed Pickering Airport from becoming a reality, at least in the near future. But in 2005, there has been renewed discussion about airport construction. The plan anticipates 11.9 million passengers per year (or 32,600 per day) by 2032. A confidential \"needs analysis study\" was completed by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority for the federal government in May 2010; in summer 2010 Transport Canada began a \"due diligence review.\"\n\nThe current landholders, mostly rural farmers are leasing the land from the federal government. Claremont is the closest community to the future airport/terminal building locations.\n\nThe Claremont General Store was destroyed by fire in July 2009. The building was built in 1847 and had been operated as a General Store since it was originally built - one of the longest operating General Stores in Canada.\n\nClaremont has a fire station and community hall, two churches, a Royal Canadian Legion hall (Branch 483), cafe (Old Brock Cafe), community co-op (which also serves as a Liquor Control Board of Ontario and Beer Store outlet) and an elementary school (Claremont Public School).\n\nClaremont was also the hometown of legendary Canadian painter Tom Thomson, who was born in Claremont on August 5, 1877.\n\nClaremont is well known in the local area for its annual \"Yard Sale Day\", an event where all residents are invited to host simultaneous garage/yard sales. The sale is typically held on the second or third Saturday of June and has been known to draw well over 1000 visitors and bargain hunters to the small hamlet. Due to its popularity, the annual event also spawns fundraisers, BBQs, and other community gatherings.\n\nClaremont remains a vibrant and active community even through the cold of winter with its annual Winter Carnival that marks a week's worth of events in January or February. The most popular of these events include a winter parade through town, a teen dance at the local community centre, karaoke at the Legion, and the highly anticipated Trapper's Ball, along with a host of traditional winter activities including snowshoeing, tobogganing, family skates at an outdoor community rink, and a neighbourhood snow sculpture contest.\n\nClaremont is part of the City of Pickering which is governed by an elected city Council consisting of six councillors and one Mayor. The City of Pickering is divided into three wards, each ward electing a City Councillor and a Regional Councillor. Claremont is part of Ward 3.\n\nThe current council was elected in November 2011. The members of the council are:\nMayor Dave Ryan\nWard 1 (South West Pickering) City Councillor Kevin Ashe\nWard 1 (South West Pickering) Regional Councillor Jennifer O'Connell\nWard 2 (South & Central Pickering) City Councillor Doug Dickerson\nWard 2 (South & Central Pickering) Regional Councillor Bill McLean\nWard 3 (South East & North Pickering) City Councillor Shaheen Butt\nWard 3 (South East & North Pickering) Regional Councillor David Pickles\n\n"}
{"id": "2065634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065634", "title": "Austin Aries", "text": "Austin Aries\n\nDaniel Healy Solwold Jr. (born April 15, 1978), better known by his ring name Austin Aries, is an American professional wrestler and voice actor, currently a free agent. He is best known for his time with Impact Wrestling, where he is a former three-time World Champion and a six time X Division Champion and Ring of Honor (ROH), where he was the first multi-time ROH World Champion. He is currently signed to Major League Wrestling (MLW) and also wrestles on the independent circuit. He is also known for his stint with WWE, where he competed primarily in the cruiserweight division as well as doing color commentary. Between Impact and ROH, Aries has held 14 total championships and has also held numerous international and U.S. independent championships.\n\nAries began to work with ROH in 2004, joining the Generation Next faction. He won the ROH World Tag Team Champion with his teammate Roderick Strong and at Final Battle 2004, ROH's biggest event, defeated Samoa Joe to win the ROH World Championship, ending his 654-day reign. He would regain the title on 2009, becoming the first multi-time champion. After moving on to Impact Wrestling, then known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Aries won the X Division Championship six times. His first reign is the longest of the title's history at 301 days and created the \"Option C\" clause, trading the title for a TNA World Heavyweight title opportunity at Destination X, winning the title. He also won the TNA World Tag Team Championship and the Impact Grand Championship, making Aries a Grand Slam Champion in Impact Wrestling.\n\nSolwold began training under Eddie Sharkey and Terry Fox in 2000 and debuted on November 11, 2000, facing \"Sheriff\" Johnny Emerald. He wrestled in the midwest for several years before his east coast wrestling career was jumpstarted after he progressed to the finals of the 2004 ECWA Super 8 Tournament, where he was defeated by Christopher Daniels.\n\nFrom there, he joined Ring of Honor. Aries made his ROH main show debut at \"ROH: Reborn Stage 2\" on April 24, 2004. Aries was unsuccessful, however, losing a four corner survival match also involving Jimmy Rave, Rocky Romero, and the winner, Nigel McGuinness. Aries was scheduled to return at the show of May 22, Generation Next, to compete in a one night series which would showcase young, upcoming ROH talent. Alex Shelley, however, hand-picked Aries, along with Roderick Strong and Jack Evans, as members of a new stable (also meant to promote young, upcoming ROH talent) who, instead of earning their spots, would simply take them. The group took the name Generation Next as their own.\n\nAries captured the ROH World Championship at \"Final Battle 2004\" on December 26, 2004, by defeating the longest reigning ROH World Champion Samoa Joe. On June 16, 2005, Ring of Honor named Aries the new head trainer at the ROH wrestling school, replacing the former head trainer, CM Punk, who had agreed to a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. After a six-month string of non-stop defenses, many of which were international, Aries lost the championship to CM Punk on June 18, 2005.\n\nOn December 17 at \"Final Battle 2005\", Aries teamed with Strong to defeat Sal Rinauro and Tony Mamaluke for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. The two then disbanded Generation Next on June 3, 2006. In a first time ever match, Aries took on Pro Wrestling Noah wrestler KENTA on June 24, but was defeated following KENTA's \"Go 2 Sleep\".\n\nOn September 16, he and his partner Strong lost the ROH World Tag Team Championship to The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli). Aries and Strong continued to team together for the rest of the year. At \"Battle of the Icons\" on January 27, 2007, Aries and Strong teamed up with Jack Evans to defeat Davey Richards, Delirious and SHINGO. This apparent Generation Next reunion was short lived when, at the following show on February 16, Strong attacked Aries after their tag team title match against Christopher Daniels and Matt Sydal. Strong then formed the \"No Remorse Corps\" with Davey Richards. Jack Evans ran down and pulled Strong off Aries, but refused to side with either of them. The following night, Aries called out Strong twice, but was unable to get his hands on him. When Evans refused to side with him, Aries said he was going to form a new faction with members of the next generation of wrestling. With that, he formed \"The Resilience\" with Erick Stevens and Matt Cross.\n\nOn April 27, Aries unsuccessfully challenged Takeshi Morishima for the Ring of Honor World Championship. On May 4, 2007, Ring of Honor announced on their website that they had signed a pay-per-view deal with G-Funk Sports and Entertainment. Following the announcement, TNA pulled Aries and Homicide, both under contracts with TNA, from all Ring of Honor shows.\n\nIn July 2005, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling held an Internet poll to select an opponent for the TNA X Division Champion Christopher Daniels at their August 14 pay-per-view, Sacrifice 2005. Billed as an \"Internet dream match\", the poll offered voters the choice of Aries, Roderick Strong, Jay Lethal and Matt Sydal, none of whom were contracted to TNA or had even appeared with the company on a regular basis in the past. Aries won the poll by a landslide, and thus faced Daniels in a non-title match at Sacrifice, which he lost. Following the event, it was rumored that TNA officials had been impressed by Aries and were considering offering him a contract, and these rumors were seemingly substantiated when Aries faced and defeated Roderick Strong at Unbreakable on September 11 in a \"showcase match\".\nOn September 22, 2005, Aries announced on his website that he had received a contract offer from TNA, and intended to sign it. He became a regular member of the TNA roster, and formed a stable with Roderick Strong and Alex Shelley. Many fans referred to this group as the second coming of Generation Next, which had contained Shelley, Strong, Aries, and Jack Evans in Ring of Honor.\n\nIn February 2006, he and Strong were both suspended for two months for arriving four hours late for the pay-per-view Against All Odds. This occurred because of Aries and Strong's decision to remain in Long Island for an ROH show, despite TNA's last minute request to travel to Florida because of the potential of a snowstorm.\n\nIn the build-up to Bound for Glory, promos began to air advertising the debut of a new wrestler, Austin Starr, at the event with the slogan \"A Starr is Born\". Starr appeared for TNA on October 22 as the first entrant and became the winner of the \"Kevin Nash Open Invitational X Division Gauntlet Battle Royal\" at Bound for Glory. After the match, Kevin Nash presented Starr with a bowling trophy and a hug.\n\nOn the following episode of \"Impact!\", it was announced that Starr would work closely with Nash's group Paparazzi Productions, much to the dismay of one of the group's founders, Alex Shelley. Starr replaced Johnny Devine as a member of Paparazzi Productions and participated in the Paparazzi Championship Series along with Shelley, eventually losing to Shelley in the finals at Final Resolution 2007. Starr then went on to feud with Senshi.\n\nOn April 18, 2007, Starr was suspended for ninety days. On May 7 it was reported by the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" that the suspension stemmed from TNA asking Austin to tape promo vignettes on a day he believed to be his day off. Starr did ultimately agree to do the vignettes but TNA saw this as a bad attitude and was reason for his suspension. During the suspension, Aries requested, and was granted, his release from TNA.\n\nOne month after being granted his release from TNA, Aries made his return to Ring of Honor. At \"United We Stand\" on June 22, 2007, Aries was in attendance, but as a \"fan\". During a match between the No Remorse Corps and The Resilience, he was verbally called out by Roderick Strong. Aries tried to climb over the guard rail, but was held back by security as he was no longer employed by the company. The following night, at Driven, Aries was again in attendance. Following a six-man tag team match between the No Remorse Corps and Delirious and The Resilience, Aries ran through the crowd and attacked the NRC. He then signed an ROH contract in the ring.\n\nAries' first match back came at \"Race to the Top Tournament: Night One\", when he faced Roderick Strong, Jimmy Rave and Gran Akuma in a Four Way Fray for the FIP World Heavyweight Championship. The feud between The Resilience and the No Remorse Corps continued at ROH's \"Death before Dishonor V\" weekend. The first night, Aries teamed with Erick Stevens to defeat Roderick Strong and Rocky Romero. However, they were not as lucky the following night, when they, along with Delirious, lost in a Street Fight to the No Remorse Corps and Matt Sydal.\nAt \"Manhattan Mayhem II\", Aries defeated former Generation Next stable mates Roderick Strong and Jack Evans in a triple threat match. At \"Glory by Honor VI: Night Two\", Aries disbanded The Resilience in order to focus on regaining the ROH World Championship. At \"Rising Above\", Aries faced current ROH champion Nigel McGuinness in a losing effort in an attempt to regain the ROH World Championship.\n\nAries began to act frustrated due to losing matches and began refusing to shake hands after matches. Jimmy Jacobs displayed interest in adding Aries to The Age of the Fall (AotF). Tammy Sytch also offered Aries her managerial services. Aries was defeated by McGuinness a second time at \"Supercard of Honor III\" in March 2008. Afterwards, Aries left with Lacey, seemingly joining the AotF. Aries returned in April and revealed that Lacey had decided to leave the AotF and that he and Lacey had become a couple. This outraged Jacobs, who attacked Aries and started a feud with him. Shortly afterwards, Lacey was apparently attacked by Jacobs outside a gym.\n\nOn April 23, Aries was chosen by Jay Briscoe as his replacement for brother Mark Briscoe as to defend the ROH World Tag Team Championship against The Age of the Fall after Mark was forced out of action due to an injury. The reasoning for this choice was Aries and the Briscoe Brothers' shared hatred for the Age of the Fall. Aries was not considered to have won the championship a second time, but rather to have been a substitute in a title defense. After their first and only title defense, the championship was vacated.\n\nOn June 6 Aries teamed with Bryan Danielson in Ring of Honor's one night tournament to crown new World Tag Team Champions. They defeated Roderick Strong and Davey Richards in the first round before being eliminated in the second by eventual winners Jimmy Jacobs and Tyler Black. On June 7 Aries and Danielson received a title shot against Jacobs and Black but were defeated when Black pinned Danielson with a Phoenix Splash.\n\nOn June 27, Aries was defeated by Necro Butcher in a \"Relaxed Rules\" match following a chair shot to the head. Aries had unsuccessfully attempted to get Butcher to leave the Age of The Fall and when Necro refused, he ceased fighting back against him. On June 28, Aries pinned ROH World Tag Team Champion Jimmy Jacobs in a \"Relaxed Rules\" match following a 450° splash despite interference from Necro Butcher, Tyler Black, Allison Wonderland, and MsChif. On July 25, Aries and Jay Briscoe teamed to defeat ROH World Tag Team Champions The Age of The Fall (Jimmy Jacobs and Tyler Black) in a No DQ Match when Briscoe pinned Black. On July 26, in Detroit, Aries spent much of the show brawling with Jimmy Jacobs culminating in both men brawling at the top of a 20-foot ladder. Jacobs' partner in the Age of The Fall, Necro Butcher, eventually tipped the ladder over sending them both crashing through a table below.\n\nAries continued his feud with Jimmy Jacobs throughout the fall. In the second Steel Cage Warfare Match at \"Glory by Honor VII\", Aries' team (Aries, Briscoe Brothers) defeated Jacobs' team (Jacobs, Black, Delirious) and Necro's team (himself only). The two had a best of three series to somewhat put an end to the feud. The first match took place at \"Ring of Homicide 2\", where Jacobs (with help from Delirious and Brodie Lee) defeated Aries in a Falls Count Anywhere Match. The second match took place at \"Bound By Hate\", and Aries defeated the bloody Jacobs in a Dog Collar Match. The deciding match was at \"Rising Above 2009\" in a \"I Quit\" Match. Lacey returned to ROH in Aries' corner, and Aries won the match. Aries continued his feud with the Age of the Fall this time against the heavily cheered Tyler Black. At \"Final Battle 2008\", Black was defeated by Aries in a Number One Contender's Match. After the match Jacobs attacked Black, and Aries ran in to make the save. Instead, however, Aries teamed up with Jacobs to attack Black. Aries later explained that the reason that he attacked Black was because the fans turned on him.\n\nIn addition to his work in ROH, Aries was announced as a member of Team Epic War for Chikara's King of Trios 2009 tournament. On the first night, Aries, along with Ryan Drago and Tony Kozina, lost to the F1rst Family (Arik Cannon, Darin Corbin and Ryan Cruz) in the first round. On the second night, Aries lost to Player Dos in the \"Rey de Voladores\" opening four corners match. On the final night, Aries lost to Eddie Kingston in a singles match.\n\nIn early 2009, Aries also underwent a complete character transformation, cutting his long hair, donning new pink and black trunks, and coming to the ring in a bright pink fur jacket. He dropped his darker persona and adapted to a new ladies man gimmick, often referring to himself as \"A Double\" and \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\", the latter after a song by Weezer, which also became his new entrance theme.\n\nOn June 13, 2009, at \"Manhattan Mayhem III\", Aries won a three-way elimination match against the ROH World Champion Jerry Lynn and Tyler Black, to become the first person to have held the ROH World Championship on more than one occasion. On December 19, 2009, at Final Battle 2009, ROH's first live pay-per-view, he defended the title by wrestling Tyler Black to a 60-minute time limit draw. On February 13, 2010, at the main event of ROH's 8th Anniversary Show, Aries lost the ROH World Championship to Tyler Black. During the following months he feuded with Delirious and Jerry Lynn, while also becoming the manager of Rhett Titus and Kenny King, the tag team known collectively as the All Night Express, dubbing himself the \"Greatest Manager That Ever Lived\". In October 2010 Aries' profile was removed from ROH's official website, after reports had surfaced that the promotion was going to be cutting down the size of their roster. On October 6, 2010, competing promotion Evolve announced that Aries would make his debut for the promotion on November 20.\n\nOn October 12, 2010, Dragon Gate USA announced that Aries had signed a contract with the promotion. Aries made his debut for the promotion on October 29 at the Bushido: Code of the Warrior pay-per-view, where he was defeated by Open the Dream Gate Champion Masato Yoshino in a non–title match. After the match, Rich Swann, whom Aries had offered to adopt as his protégé, turned his offer down. On January 28, 2011, at , Aries defeated Swann in a singles match. The following month Aries started a storyline, where he claimed to have lost the motivation to continue his professional wrestling career, after failing to make the cast of \"WWE Tough Enough\", before offering to put his Dragon Gate USA career on the line in order to get one last shot at Yamato and the Open the Freedom Gate Championship. On April 2 at Mercury Rising 2011, Aries was unsuccessful in his challenge, thus seemingly bringing his Dragon Gate USA career to an end. The following day at Open the Ultimate Gate, Aries was defeated by Jimmy Jacobs in what was billed as his Dragon Gate USA farewell match. However, after the match Aries feigned passing the torch to Chuck Taylor, Johnny Gargano and Rich Swann, the trio known collectively as Ronin, before turning on them and joining the promotion's top heel group, Blood Warriors, claiming to have found his purpose under the leadership of CIMA. Blood Warriors and Ronin faced each other in a six-man elimination tag team match on June 5 at Enter The Dragon 2011, which Ronin won after Johnny Gargano managed to submit the Gargano Escape on both CIMA and Aries.\n\nOn June 9, 2011, it was reported that Aries had left both Dragon Gate USA and Evolve to reportedly pursue a career outside of professional wrestling. Aries later revealed that he considered retiring from professional wrestling because he \"didn't want to be Randy the Ram in 10, 20 years.\" However, he decided to continue wrestling after receiving an offer from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, to be a part of the X-Division Showcase.\n\nOn June 13, 2011, at the tapings of the June 16 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Aries made a return to TNA, defeating Jimmy Rave and Kid Kash in a first round match of the X Division Showcase tournament for a contract with the promotion. On July 10 at Destination X, Aries defeated Jack Evans, Low Ki and Zema Ion to win the tournament and earn a contract with TNA. In his first match on \"Impact\" since being officially re-signed, Aries defeated Shannon Moore in a singles match, after hitting him with a steel chain and then pinning him for the victory, thus returning to his A Double character and establishing himself as a heel. On the July 21 episode of \"Impact\", Aries cost Alex Shelley, who had previously confronted him on his win over Shannon Moore, his shot at the X Division Championship. Two weeks later, Aries defeated Shelley in a singles match. On August 7 at Hardcore Justice, Aries and Shelley competed in a three-way match for the TNA X Division Championship, but were both unable to win the belt from the defending champion, Brian Kendrick.\n\nOn the August 18 episode of \"Impact\" Aries won an eight-man gauntlet match to earn another shot at the X Division Championship. On September 11 at No Surrender, Aries defeated Kendrick to win the X Division Championship for the first time. On October 16 at Bound for Glory, Aries defeated Kendrick in a rematch to retain the title. On November 13 at Turning Point, Aries defeated Jesse Sorensen and Kid Kash in a three-way match to retain the X Division Championship. On December 11 at Final Resolution, Aries defeated Kash in a singles match to retain the X Division Championship. On January 8, 2012, at Genesis, Aries successfully defended the X Division Championship in a four-way elimination match against Jesse Sorensen, Kid Kash and Zema Ion. On February 12 at Against All Odds, Aries defeated Alex Shelley with his \"Last Chancery\" submission hold to retain the X Division Championship. On the March 8 episode of \"Impact\", Aries was defeated by Ion via disqualification, after Aries was caught using Ion's hair spray on him; as a result, Aries retained his title. On March 12, Aries became the longest reigning X Division Champion in history by breaking the previous record of 182 days, set by Christopher Daniels in 2005. On March 18 at Victory Road, Aries successfully defended the title against Zema Ion. On the following episode of \"Impact\", Aries again retained the title after he wrestled Ion, Kid Kash and Anthony Neese to a no contest, following interference from Bully Ray. Aries finalized his face turn the following week, when he teamed with James Storm to defeat Ray and Bobby Roode in the main event. The rivalry between Aries and Ray continued on April 15 at Lockdown, where the two were on opposing teams in the annual Lethal Lockdown match. Aries' team, led by Garett Bischoff, ended up defeating Ray's team, led by Eric Bischoff. Aries continued his record-breaking title reign on the May 10 episode of \"Impact\" by successfully defending the X Division Championship against Zema Ion. Three days later at Sacrifice, Aries defeated Bully Ray in a singles match, submitting him with the \"Last Chancery\". On May 19, Aries announced that he had signed a contract extension with TNA. On the live May 31 episode of \"Impact\", Aries successfully defended the X Division Championship against Chris Sabin. Earlier in the episode, Aries had a run-in with Samoa Joe, which led to Joe costing Aries his match with Crimson the following week. On June 10 at Slammiversary, Aries defeated Joe to retain the X Division Championship. On the following episode of \"Impact\", Aries competed in his first Ultimate X match, where he successfully defended the X Division Championship against Chris Sabin and Zema Ion.\n\nFollowing his win, Aries announced that he was not satisfied with being just the X Division Champion, which led to General Manager Hulk Hogan promising him a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but only if he first vacated the X Division Championship. The following week, Aries agreed to Hogan's terms with the caveat that every year before the annual Destination X pay-per-view, future X Division Champions be given the same opportunity. Aries relinquished the X Division Championship two weeks later, ending his record-breaking reign at 301 days. On July 8, Aries defeated Bobby Roode in the main event of Destination X to become the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. On July 17, TNA president Dixie Carter announced that Aries had signed a new long-term deal with the promotion. Aries and Roode had a non-title rematch on the July 19 episode of \"Impact\", which ended in a no contest, when both competitors were attacked by a group of masked assailants, known only as the \"Aces & Eights\". On August 12 at Hardcore Justice, Aries successfully defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Roode, with a pre-match stipulation preventing Roode from getting another rematch for the title as long as Aries was champion. During the following weeks, Aries moved from Roode to defending TNA against the Aces & Eights. On the September 20 episode of \"Impact\", after Jeff Hardy had won the 2012 Bound for Glory Series to become Aries' next challenger for the World Heavyweight Championship, Aries began working as a tweener, claiming that he could match anything Hardy had ever done in his career. On October 11, during the final episode of \"Impact\" before Bound for Glory, Aries continued his turn into a villainous character, claiming that he worked best when people were against him, before crotching Hardy on the ring ropes and dropping him with a brainbuster. Three days later in the main event of Bound for Glory, TNA's largest annual event, Aries lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Hardy, ending his reign at 98 days.\n\nOn the October 25 episode of \"Impact\", Aries attacked Hardy, after he had successfully defended his title against Kurt Angle, stealing one of his two title belts and announcing that a rematch between the two would take place at Turning Point. On November 11 at the pay-per-view, Aries failed to regain the World Heavyweight Championship from Hardy in a ladder match. On the November 22 episode of \"Impact\", Aries moved from Hardy to becoming a disruption around the Impact Zone by revealing a secret relationship between Bully Ray and General Manager Hulk Hogan's daughter Brooke. The following week, Aries was chosen by Hogan as the number one contender to Rob Van Dam's X Division Championship. Aries defeated Van Dam in the main event via disqualification, following interference from Bully Ray, but as the title does not change hands on a disqualification, Van Dam retained. On December 9 at Final Resolution, Aries defeated Ray in a singles match, following a distraction from both Brooke and Hulk Hogan and a low blow from Aries. On the December 13 episode of \"Impact\", Aries was revealed as the man who paid the Aces & Eights to prevent Bobby Roode, who originally paid the group to help him win the World Heavyweight Championship, from winning at the pay-per-view, which led Jeff Hardy to issue him a title challenge. On the December 20 episode of \"Impact\", Aries was unsuccessful in his challenge for Hardy's World Heavyweight Championship, following interference from Bobby Roode. Aries and Roode faced off in a number one contenders match on the December 27 episode of \"Impact\". The match ended in a no contest after the two attacked referee Earl Hebner and then were, in turn attacked by Hardy. The rivalry culminated in a three-way elimination match on January 13, 2013, at Genesis, where Aries failed again to regain the World Heavyweight Championship from Hardy.\n\nOn January 25, at the tapings of the February 7 episode of \"Impact\" in Manchester, England, Roode and Aries defeated Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Hernandez to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship, thus giving Aries the TNA Triple Crown. Roode and Aries made their first successful title defense on March 10 at Lockdown, defeating Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian) and Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Hernandez in a three-way match.

Aries and Roode faced Daniels and Kazarian in number one contenders match on the May 9 episode of \"Impact\", however, the match ended in a no contest after special guest referee James Storm superkicked Aries and Daniels and walked out on the match. Aries and Roode received another shot at Guerrero and Hernandez's titles on June 2 at Slammiversary XI, in an fatal four-way elimination match, which was won by Gunner and James Storm.\n\nOn the June 13 episode of \"Impact\", Aries defeated Eric Young to qualify for the 2013 Bound for Glory Series. The following week, Aries defeated Jay Bradley in his first BFG series match via pinfall to earn seven points in the tournament. On the June 27 episode of \"Impact\", Aries disguised himself as Suicide and defeated Chris Sabin and Kenny King to win his second X Division Championship. Aries unmasked himself at the end of the show, after Hulk Hogan discovered the real Suicide and demanded the fake Suicide to unmask, and announced that he intended to trade in the X Division Championship for a World Heavyweight Championship match at Destination X. The following week, however, Aries lost the X Division Championship back to Sabin in a three-way match, which also included the real Suicide, now known as Manik. On the August 1 episode of \"Impact\", Aries turned face after praising AJ Styles, before being interrupted by his former tag team partner Bobby Rhode.

On the February 6 episode of \"Impact\", Aries successfully defended his X Division Championship against Zema Ion, who cashed in his Feast or Fired briefcase.\n\nThree weeks later, on the February 27 episode of \"Impact\", served as the special guest referee in a match between Bobby Roode and MVP. Aries attacked MVP, allowing Roode to win the match, turning heel once again. On March 2, Aries lost the X Division Championship to Seiya Sanada at Wrestle-1's event in Tokyo, Japan.

Later that night, Aries lost to Young.\n\nAt the June 20 \"Impact\" taping, Aries won back the X Division Championship from Sanada for his fifth reign. A mere five days after regaining the championship, Aries chose to invoke \"Option C\" to vacate the championship for a title shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Destination X on June 26, where he lost to the champion Lashley. Then, Aries entered in a short feud against James Storm and his new apprentice The Great Sanada, when Aries was defeated by him on the August 27 episode of \"Impact\". Aries suffered a loss once again against the duo in a tag-team match, teaming with Tajiri on the September 10 episode of \"Impact\". Three weeks later, Aries challenged Samoa Joe for his TNA X Division Championship, but was ultimately defeated. On January 7, 2015, Aries defeated Low Ki to regain the X Division Championship for the sixth time. Low Ki recaptured the title during the January 16 \"Impact\" episode after interference from The Beat Down Clan.\n\nDuring the January 23 \"Impact\" episode, Aries won the annual Feast or Fired, affording him an opportunity at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Throughout February and March, Aries continued to feud with the Beat Down Clan with Low Ki stealing Aries' briefcase after a match with Samoa Joe, with Aries eventually taking it back. At Lockdown, Aries took part in the annual Lethal Lockdown match with Team Kurt Angle, defeating The Beat Down Clan. Aries also reformed the Dirty Heels with Bobby Roode, with the two challenging The Wolves to a best of 5 series for the Tag Team Titles. The Wolves won the first two matches and Aries and Roode won the third. At Destination X, Aries cashed in his Feast or Fired briefcase for an opportunity at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship on Kurt Angle, however Angle retained the championship. After defeating the Wolves in the fourth match of the series, which was a Full Metal Mayhem match, Aries defeated Davey Richards at Slammiversary XIII to have the option to choose the stipulation for the final match in the series. Aries and Roode chose an Iron Man tag team match, which they ultimately lost on the \"Bell to Bell\" special edition of \"Impact\". On the August 5 episode of \"Impact\" (taped before his release), Aries asked for a title shot, General Manager Bully Ray scheduled Aries against Rockstar Spud after Aries turned heel and ripped on Spud and the whole X Division.

On June 28, 2015, Aries left TNA as his contract with the company expired.\n\nDuring a select number of episodes of \"Impact\" in October and November (taped in July), Aries was put into the TNA World Title Series for the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship, scoring 4 points in the tournament, but he finished in third for his block, thus failing to advance through the qualifying round of 16.\n\nOn July 6, 2015, Ring of Honor announced the return of Aries. Aries was then announced as the replacement for Roderick Strong in the Vegas Wild Card six-man tag match on July 17 alongside Moose and ROH World and Television Champion Jay Lethal against Jay Briscoe, Dalton Castle and Kyle O'Reilly.\n\nOn March 9, 2018, Aries returned to Ring of Honor (ROH) for the third time at ROH's 16th Anniversary pay-per-view, where he originally challenged Kenny King to a match for King's ROH World Television Championship at a later date, the only ROH singles title Aries has yet to win. On May 13 on the ROH/NJPW War of the Worlds Tour, Aries challenged Silas Young, who won the World Television Championship at Supercard of Honor XII, for the title in a match that Young won by disqualification when King hit him with the title. After the match, Aries attacked Todd Sinclar and King, turning heel.\n\nOn January 22, 2016, WWE announced that Aries would be joining NXT. On the March 2 episode of \"NXT\", Aries made his debut as a fan favorite, being introduced by NXT General Manager William Regal before being attacked by Baron Corbin on his way to the ring. A match was booked between the two at on April 1, where Aries defeated Corbin. On the May 18 episode of \"NXT\", Aries teamed up with Shinsuke Nakamura to defeat the team of Blake and Murphy. On the May 25 episode of \"NXT\", Aries declared his intention to become the next NXT Champion, which prompted a response from Nakamura, and NXT General Manager William Regal then scheduled a match between the two at on June 8, which Nakamura won. On the June 22 episode of \"NXT\", Aries came out to seemingly thank No Way José for reminding him that wrestling was about having fun, only to attack him after an impromptu dance party, turning heel in the process. Aries defeated No Way José by submission at on August 20. Aries entered the second Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament, teaming with Roderick Strong but the pair dropped out of the tournament after advancing through the first round after Aries suffered an injury.\n\nOn October 27, Aries suffered a large orbital socket injury during a live event at Fresno, California, in a match against Shinsuke Nakamura and was expected to be out of action until early 2017. It was revealed in November 2016 that permanent titanium plates were inserted to repair the injury.\n\nOn December 18, at , Aries made his WWE pay-per-view debut alongside Michael Cole and Corey Graves, calling the triple threat match between Rich Swann, TJ Perkins and The Brian Kendrick. The following night on \"Raw\", Aries provided commentary during the cruiserweight match.

On March 7, he made his \"205 Live\" in-ring debut, defeating Tony Nese. On March 13, Aries defeated Ariya Daivari on his \"Raw\" in-ring debut. On the March 14 episode of \"205 Live\", Aries defeated TJ Perkins, Akira Tozawa, The Brian Kendrick and Tony Nese in a Fatal 5-Way elimination match to become the number one contender for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship at WrestleMania 33, last eliminating Kendrick to win. However, Aries lost to Neville during the pre-show in the opening match. On the April 4 episode of \"205 Live\", Aries defeated Jack Gallagher, TJ Perkins and Mustafa Ali in a fatal four-way match to earn a rematch against Neville at Payback, which he won by disqualification. Aries again failed to win the Cruiserweight Championship after he was defeated by Neville at Extreme Rules in a submission match.\n\nOn July 7, 2017, Aries was released from his WWE contract. Initial reports stated that Aries was frustrated with his role in the company and asked to be let out of his contract, but Dave Meltzer stated that Aries apparently did not ask for his release and was said to be incredibly unpopular with WWE's writing staff and others backstage.\n\nIn early 2018, Aries made his official return to TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling, calling himself the \"Belt Collector\", displaying all of the championships he was holding in various other promotions. He then defeated Eli Drake to win the Impact World Championship. Aries also won the Impact Grand Championship, defeating Matt Sydal, a few days later in a Winner Take All match, which at that point made him an Impact Wrestling Grand Slam winner, a double champion within Impact Wrestling, and at one point being a sextuple champion overall with six titles between five companies based in three different continents (North America, Europe, and Australia). After feuding with Eli Drake and Matt Sydal, Austin Aries began a feud with Alberto El Patron for the Impact World Championship. Set to fight for the World Title at Impact's newest event, Redemption, Alberto El Patron was released from his contract by Impact Wrestling after no showing an event at Wrestlecon. The main event of Redemption was now a triple threat match, pitting Austin Aries against Lucha Underground's Fénix and Pentagón Jr. Pentagón Jr. walked out as the new Impact World Champion.\n\nOn the May 31 \"Under Pressure\" themed Impact, which was taped on April 24, Aries turned heel for the first time since 2016 when he used a low blow to defeat Pentagon Jr. to win the Impact World Title for a third time. Aries subsequently formally unified the Grand and World championships at a press conference on June 4, 2018. At Slammiversary XVI, Aries successfully retained his title against Moose. Aries's next championship defense came on Impact's August 9 edition, defeating Eddie Edwards with the help of Killer Kross, whom the champion would announce as his \"insurance policy\" the following week. The heel duo were joined by Moose after the latter betrayed Edwards during a tag team match on the August 30 airing of Impact.\n\nAries' next title defense would come against Johnny Impact, at Bound for Glory on October 14. As the PPV moved closer, the feud started to blur the lines between a work (something scripted) and shoot (something real), beginning with the two wrestlers trading insults on Twitter that they appeared to take personal, with Aries later deleting many of his tweets. Specifically, Impact mocked Aries' short stature and the champion responded by making fun of Impact's wife, Taya Valkyrie weight. Aries and Impact both alleged in the media that they authentically took issue with comments. TMZ Live also pushed the angle \"like [it] was a shoot\". The two wrestlers got in a brawl the night before Bound for Glory during Abyss's Impact Hall of Fame induction.\n\nAries would drop the title to Impact the following night, but the former champion seemingly no-sold the finish, as he got up quickly after getting pinned, yelled at commentator/owner Don Callis and left the ring while flipping off the crowd, Impact, and Callis. Kross and Moose, who were both at ringside during the match, and Impact all looked to be confused with Aries' actions, and the new champion also appeared to mouth \"are you kidding me?\". Reports later attributed Aries getting up so fast following the finish of the match to a concussion Aries suffered during the match. Impact Wrestling producer Petey Williams stated that Bound For Glory was the last date on Aries contract. Aries was present at the first day of television tapings for \"Impact\" on October 8, but was \"sent home\" and scripts had to be rewritten for the show. Dave Meltzer later reported that both Impact and Aries started an online feud without management's permission.\n\nAfter his release from the WWE and his 90-day non-compete clause expired, Aries made a surprise return to Impact Pro Wrestling providing commentary during their event and promoting his book on November 4, 2017. Then on November 18, Aries returned to House of Hardcore 35 where he was promoting his book and calling himself The Truth. On December 2, House of Hardcore 36: Blizzard Brawl Homecoming, Aries defeated Joey Mercury in his House Of Hardcore in ring return. On April 13, 2018, Aries wrestled on a card for the Seattle based independent promotion DEFY Wrestling, and won that company's championship. On August 17, 2018, Aries appeared on House of Glory's \"High Intensity 7\" show and successfully defended the Impact World Championship in an open challenge against Ken Broadway.\n\nIn August 2018 Aries appeared on Ring Warriors television tapings for WGN America. It was reported that he signed on to wrestle for Ring Warriors and be involved behind the scenes in a creative aspect. Their television program debuted on September 15, 2018. He went on to wrestle on five episodes of their first season. The first two appearances he successfully defended the Impact World Heavyweight Championship on the program. Aries first match of 2019 occurred at Warrior Wrestling 3, where Aries lost a street fight to Eddie Edwards. On March 15, 2019, Aries returned to Warrior Wrestling at Warrior Wrestling 4 to face Eddie Edwards in a rematch. Following that match ending in a disqualification, a steel cage match was booked for Warrior Wrestling 5 between the two competitors.\n\nAries debuted at World Series Wrestling (WSW) Australia's tour in 2017. Aries wrestled against Ricochet and Brian Cage for the WSW championship at Adelaide's show, however he fell short on capturing the title. He won the title at Sydney's show where he defeated Ricochet after an interference from Brian Cage. On December 4, 2017, Aries appeared on a show for the UK-based Defiant Wrestling promotion. The following day, Aries defeated Marty Scurll to win the Defiant Championship. Months later, at No Regrets 2018, Aries lost the title to Rampage, in his final match for Defiant. On December 17, 2017, Austin Aries defeated Mark Haskins at The Big Bang: Undisputed to win the IPW:UK World Championship. In June 2018 Aries returned to WSW for another tour. On the June 24 show, Aries defeated Johnny Impact to win their WSW Heavyweight Championship. He then returned to WSW in November 2018, where he lost the WSW Heavyweight Championship to Robbie Eagles on November 26. In March 2019, he completed another tour with WSW, wrestling Abyss in a Monster's Ball match and unsuccessfully challenging Robbie Eagles for the WSW Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn February 8, 2018, Aries debuted for Major League Wrestling (MLW) at their Road to the World Championship event, after being backstage at their two previous events. At the show he defeated ACH, taking a microphone after the bout announcing his intention of becoming the MLW World Middleweight Champion. The match would later be aired as the opening match of MLW's debut episode of MLW Fusion on BeIN Sports. However, he would not again appear for the promotion in over a year. On the May 11, 2019 episode of MLW Fusion, a vignette aired announcing that Aries had signed to MLW and he would be returning soon. He debuted at MLW Fury Road, defeating Adam Brooks.\n\nPrior to working for WWE, Aries provided the voice for the main character Jacob Cass in the Road to WrestleMania mode of the \"WWE '12\" video game. Aries later appeared as himself only on \"WWE 2K17\" as a downloadable character as part of the \"Future Stars\" pack. He was intended to be included in \"WWE 2K18\", going as far as to have had commentary recorded for him, but was ultimately cut due to leaving WWE.\n\nAries has been a vegan since 2011 and has appeared in PETA videos encouraging the lifestyle. Aries dated fellow professional wrestler Zelina Vega in the past, from 2012-2018. Aries is also a fan of the Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Brewers, and Milwaukee Bucks and played both football and baseball growing up.

The cover art is painted by Leo Hao.\n\nThe band intended to record a DVD since early 1998, however, due to the band's high requirements, no existing metal festival had been considered suitable. Instead, Blind Guardian decided to create their own festival, back in their homeland. The First Blind Guardian Festival was held in Coburg, Germany, on June 16–17, 2003.\nIt lasted 2 days, with the band playing during both nights. The entire show has been professionally recorded and subsequently released on a DVD entitled Imaginations through the Looking Glass on June 14, 2004.\n\nThe show had been very well prepared for the recording, with complex lighting and pyrotechnic effects set up to assist the musicians in creating the atmosphere. Blind Guardian's performance is generally considered excellent, and the degree of the audience's involvement was surprising even to the band members themselves. This is especially visible when the crowd continued to sing the chorus of \"Valhalla\" after the song was well over, stopping to cheer, and then starting to sing again, joined by an impromptu drum beat.\n\nThe setlist was partly based on a poll conducted on the band's website, which (combined with the amount of time the band had) led to a varied set with classics like \"The Bard's Song (in the Forest)\" but also some rarely played songs such as \"Somewhere Far Beyond\".\n\nThere are two (two-layer) DVDs in the release; the first one contains the show itself, with 20 tracks and approximately 125 minutes of running time. Disc 2 contains extra material, including an interview with the band and 4 bonus songs, recorded in previous tours. The set has a typical Blind Guardian fantasy-style artwork painted by Leo Hao, mixed with photos from the show, with several humorous elements included such as a picture of Legolas, Gimli and Gollum buying tickets for the concert.\n\n\n\n"}

In the published version of Frank's diary, \"The Diary of a Young Girl\", he is given the pseudonym Mr. Koophuis. In some later publications of the diary, the pseudonym was removed, and Kleiman was referred to by his real name.\n\nKleiman was born in Koog aan de Zaan, Netherlands and met Otto Frank in 1923, when he was trying to establish a branch of the Michael Frank Bank in Amsterdam. Kleiman was registered as a proxy for the bank in May 1924 and given full powers in December of that year when the bank went into liquidation. He was hired by Frank as a bookkeeper for Opekta and Pectacon in 1938, but had become a close friend from about 1933, when the Frank family fled to the Netherlands to escape Nazi persecution in Germany.\n\nJohannes Kleiman became a member of the board of Opekta and the company was established at his home address for the next five months until it moved to Prinsengracht 263 at the end of 1940. He officially joined as bookkeeper for both Opekta and Pectacon, with Victor Kugler and secretary Bep Voskuijl for Pectacon, and Otto Frank and his secretary Miep Gies for Opekta.\n\nIn August 1944, Kleiman was arrested with Victor Kugler during the Gestapo raid that arrested the Frank family and four other concealed Jews in the premises on the Prinsengracht. After interrogation at Gestapo headquarters, he and Kugler were transferred to a prison on the Amstelveenseweg for Jews and political prisoners awaiting deportation. Kleiman was imprisoned in the Amersfoort labour camp before he was released by special dispensation of the Red Cross because of his ill health. In all, he was a prisoner of the Nazis for about six weeks.\n\nAfter the publication of Anne Frank's diary, which detailed her two years in hiding, Kleiman regularly took journalists and visitors around the former hiding place, which had been vacated in the early 1950s. He became very involved in the establishment of the Anne Frank Foundation on 3 May 1957 but did not live to see the building open as a museum in 1960. He died, behind his desk, on 28 January 1959. Otto Frank was devastated about this loss. On 8 March 1972, Yad Vashem recognized Kleiman as one of the Righteous Among the Nations.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1970 by Roger Corman as New World Pictures, Ltd.: a producer and distributor of motion pictures, eventually expanding into television production in 1984. New World eventually expanded into broadcasting with the acquisition of seven television stations in 1993, with the broadcasting unit expanding through additional purchases made during 1994.\n\n20th Century Fox (then owned by News Corporation), controlled by Rupert Murdoch, became a major investor in 1994 and purchased the company outright in 1997; the alliance with Murdoch, particularly through a group affiliation agreement with New World reached between the two companies in May 1994, helped to cement the Fox network as the fourth major U.S. television network.\n\nAlthough effectively defunct, it continues to exist as holding companies within the Fox Corporation corporate structure along with various regional subsidiaries (e.g. \"New World Communications of Tampa\"). The content library, however, is owned by The Walt Disney Company through its acquisition of 21st Century Fox.\n\nThe company was founded on July 8, 1970, as New World Pictures, Ltd.; it was co-founded by B-movie director Roger Corman and his brother Gene, following their departure from American International Pictures (AIP). At the time, New World was the last remaining national low-budget film distributor, and was also one of the most successful independent companies in the nation. Corman hoped to continue AIP's formula at New World, making low-budget films by new talent and distributing them internationally. However, it started out with only ten domestic offices, and one each in Canada and the United Kingdom; its films were distributed regionally by other companies.\n\nNew World initially made exploitation films such as \"The Student Nurses\" and other small-scale productions. Corman helped launch the filmmaking careers of Jonathan Demme (\"Caged Heat\", \"Crazy Mama\"), Jonathan Kaplan (\"White Line Fever\"), Ron Howard (\"Grand Theft Auto\"), Paul Bartel (\"Death Race 2000\") and Joe Dante (\"Piranha\"), all of whom made some of their early films as interns for the company. New World also released foreign films from acclaimed directors such as Ingmar Bergman (\"Cries and Whispers\", \"Autumn Sonata\"), Federico Fellini (\"Amarcord\") and Akira Kurosawa (\"Dersu Uzala\"). The distribution of such films was conceived by Corman in an effort to disassociate New World as an exhibitor of exploitation films.\n\nIn 1983, Corman sold New World to Larry Kupin, Harry E. Sloan and Larry A. Thompson for $16.5 million; the three new owners decided to take the company public. Corman retained the film library, while New World acquired home video rights to the releases. In 1984, Robert Rehme – who formerly served as chief executive officer of Avco Embassy Pictures and Universal Pictures and had previously worked for New World as its vice president of sales in the 1970s – returned to the company as its new CEO. Later that year Thompson left the company to form his own firm.\n\nIn 1984, the company created three new divisions: New World International, which would handle distribution of New World's productions outside the United States; New World Television, a production unit focusing on television programs (the first television programs produced by the unit were the soap opera \"Santa Barbara\" and the made-for-TV movie \"Playing With Fire\"); and New World Video, which would handle home video distribution of films produced mainly by New World Pictures. In May 1986, New World acquired post-production facility Lions Gate Studios for $4.4 million. That November the company acquired the Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG), the corporate parent of Marvel Comics from the liquidated Cadence Industries. By early 1987, the company sold its shares in Taft Broadcasting for $17.8 million.\n\nIn 1987, New World acquired independent film studio Highgate Pictures and educational film company Learning Corporation of America. By this time New World Pictures changed its name to New World Entertainment to better reflect its range of subsidiaries besides the film studio, including its purchase of Marvel Comics. Also that year New World almost purchased two toy companies, Kenner Parker Toys and Mattel, but both planned acquisitions never materialized (although Tonka would acquire Kenner in 1987). In the fall of 1987, New World became the third in the list of prime time television series producers to the network after Lorimar-Telepictures and MCA. In 1988, Michael Mann, executive producer of the hour-long television program \"Crime Story\", filed a lawsuit against New World.\n\nAround this time, New World faced a major financial slump and the company began restructuring itself. Facing insolvency, management appealed to New World's principal lender, GE Capital, for a comprehensive debt restructuring, which would have wiped out the company's equity and left GE holding a 90% ownership stake. GE demurred, preferring an insolvency workout, and tried to force the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Another equity firm, Sloan And Kupin, instead pursued an aggressive program of divestitures and sales, which ultimately yielded a substantial profit to management while leaving the debt holders struggling. This began with the sale of Marvel Entertainment Group to Andrews Group (run by financier Ronald Perelman) on January 6, 1989; Marvel Productions was excluded from the sale. In an ironic twist, Perelman acquired New World Entertainment, with Four Star Television becoming a unit of the company, later that year. The bulk of its film and home video holdings were sold in January 1990 to Trans-Atlantic Pictures, a newly formed production company founded by a consortium of former New World executives (Trans-Atlantic was sold to Lakeshore Entertainment in 1996). Highgate Pictures and Learning Corporation of America were shut down in 1990. On October 7, 1991, New World sold much of its \"network\" television assets to Sony Pictures Entertainment. Some television programs produced by New World such as \"Santa Barbara\" and \"The Wonder Years\" would remain in production by the company until their cancellations in 1993; New World would not return to producing programs for the major broadcast television networks until early 1995.\n\nIn December 1992, New World formed two new divisions, New World Family Filmworks and New World Action Animation, to increase production for the growing family market by $20 million; Marvel Productions President Rick Ungar was appointed to head the two divisions. Following Marvel Entertainment Group's acquisition of Toy Biz in 1993, that company's CEO Avi Arad was named President and CEO of both New World Family Filmworks and Marvel Films, a new unit formed as a joint venture between Marvel and New World (which included an animation studio, Marvel Films Animation); Marvel Productions was renamed New World Animation in 1993.\n\nOn February 17, 1993, Perelman purchased SCI Television from George Gillett, acquiring the company's seven television stations: CBS affiliates WAGA-TV (channel 5) in Atlanta, WJBK-TV (channel 2) in Detroit, WJW-TV (channel 8) in Cleveland, WITI-TV (channel 6) in Milwaukee and WTVT (channel 13) in Tampa; NBC affiliate KNSD (channel 39) in San Diego; and independent station WSBK-TV (channel 38) in Boston. Also included in the purchase was the library of Storer-owned syndication firm Blair Entertainment, which it had bought in 1985. SCI had undergone several corporate restructurings following its 1987 purchase by Gillett Communications from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (which, in turn, had acquired the stations' former parent Storer Communications in 1985). Earlier in the decade, the group – then known as GCI Broadcast Services, Inc. – had restructured after defaulting on some of its financing agreements. Eventually, the renamed, SCI ran into severe financial problems and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 1992. SCI was folded into New World, following the completion of its purchase of the group by Perelman in the summer of 1993.\n\nIn 1993, New World Entertainment purchased ownership stakes in syndication distributor Genesis Entertainment through Four Star Television and made a direct purchase of infomercial production company, Guthy-Renker. With the asset expansion, the company changed its name to New World Communications.\n\nThe company expanded its broadcasting holdings in May 1994 with its purchase of Argyle Television – a company partially related to Argyle Television Holdings II, which merged with Hearst Broadcasting to form Hearst-Argyle Television in 1997 – acquiring its four stations: CBS affiliates KTBC-TV (channel 7) in Austin, Texas, and KDFW-TV (channel 4) in Dallas; NBC affiliate WVTM-TV (channel 13) in Birmingham, Alabama; and ABC affiliate KTVI (channel 2) in St. Louis. Then, New World acquired four of the six television stations owned by Citicasters: ABC affiliates WBRC-TV (channel 6) in Birmingham and WGHP-TV (channel 8) in High Point, North Carolina; NBC affiliate WDAF-TV (channel 4) in Kansas City, Missouri; and CBS affiliate KSAZ-TV (channel 10) in Phoenix. Citicasters retained ownership of ABC affiliates WKRC-TV (channel 12) in Cincinnati, Ohio, and WTSP (channel 10) in St. Petersburg, Florida; in the latter case, New World decided against buying WTSP, as WTVT had the higher viewership of the two stations and market-wide signal coverage (WTSP's analog signal did not adequately cover southern sections of the Tampa–St. Petersburg market, as its transmitter was short-spaced to avoid interfering with the signal of Miami ABC affiliate WPLG, as both stations broadcast on VHF channel 10; because of this reason, ABC has long maintained a secondary Tampa affiliate in Sarasota-based WWSB).\n\nThe concurrent purchases of WBRC and WGHP posed issues as, at the time, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) only allowed a single company to own a maximum of 12 television stations nationwide (the Argyle and Citicasters purchases, combined with the seven stations it earlier acquired from SCI Television, would have given New World a total of 15 stations) and in the case of Birmingham, New World could not keep WBRC and WVTM in any event, as the FCC forbade common ownership of two television stations in the same market. As a result, following the completion of the Citicasters station purchases in late March 1995, New World placed WBRC and WGHP in a blind trust and sought buyers for both stations.\n\nThe biggest deal involving New World Communications would aid in changing the face of American broadcasting. In the wake of Fox's landmark $1.58-billion deal with the National Football League (NFL) on December 17, 1993, which awarded it the television rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) beginning with the league's 1994 season, the network began seeking agreements with various station groups such as SF Broadcasting to affiliate with VHF stations that had established histories as affiliates of the Big Three broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) and therefore had higher value with advertisers (compared to its predominately UHF affiliate body, the vast majority of which were independent stations before joining the network), in an effort to bolster the network's newly acquired package of NFL game telecasts.\n\nShortly after the Citicasters acquisition announcement, on May 23, 1994, New World Communications and Fox reached a multi-year affiliation agreement in which New World would switch most of its television stations to the network beginning that fall. The deal would include most of the stations that New World was in the midst of acquiring from Argyle and Citicasters, with all of the affected stations joining Fox after existing affiliation contracts with their then-current network partners concluded (WDAF-TV and KSAZ-TV were the first to switch on September 12, 1994, when Fox televised its inaugural regular-season NFL games; KDFW, KTBC and KTVI switched on July 1, 1995, while all but three of the other stations that remained under New World ownership switched on either December 11 or 12, 1994). In exchange, Fox parent News Corporation agreed to purchase a 20% interest in New World for $500 million. New World was approached by Fox in part due to the group's expanding presence in several primary and secondary markets of NFC teams (including those of the Dallas Cowboys, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Green Bay Packers, Detroit Lions, Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals; St. Louis and Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point would respectively become NFL markets in 1995 with the relocation of the Rams from Los Angeles and the foundation of the Charlotte-based Carolina Panthers). New World, meanwhile, was concerned about the effect that the network's loss of NFC rights to Fox would have on both CBS, which was near the bottom of the network ratings at the time, and on the group's CBS-affiliated stations.\n\nThe stations that became Fox affiliates had to acquire or produce additional programming to fill their broadcast days, as Fox programmed significantly fewer hours of network content (prime time programming for two hours on Monday through Saturdays and three hours on Sundays, the Monday through Saturday children's block Fox Kids, and an hour of late night programming on Saturdays) than its three established major network competitors; on top of that, most of the New World stations (with KTVI later becoming the lone exception) declined to carry the Fox Kids block, a peculiarity even at a time when some ABC, NBC and CBS affiliates were still pre-empting portions of their network's children's program lineups. The time vacated by news programs, daytime shows and children's programs from each station's former network was filled by additional syndicated programming and, in particular, local newscasts. In the latter regard, local morning newscasts on the stations were expanded by one to two hours and early-evening newscasts by a half-hour; the majority of the stations – except, initially, for KTBC (which did not launch an hour-long 9:00 p.m. newscast until August 2000) and KTVI (which did not launch a 9:00 p.m. newscast until September 1996 as a half-hour program), both of which aired syndicated programs as lead-ins to their 10:00 p.m. newscasts – also carried a newscast in the final hour of prime time. The deal as a whole (as well as a second affiliation agreement that was struck one month after the New World deal through the purchase of four Burnham Broadcasting stations by SF Broadcasting, a joint venture with Savoy Pictures) caused a domino effect that resulted in various individual and group affiliation deals involving all four networks (primarily CBS, Fox, and ABC) affecting television stations in more than 70 media markets; in most of those areas, New World did not own a station.\n\nThree New World stations were excluded from the Fox affiliation deal. In Boston, where New World owned WSBK-TV, Fox was already affiliated with WFXT (channel 25), which the network would later re-acquire from the Boston Celtics in July 1995 (besides that, WSBK – like WFXT – was a UHF station with no prior history as a major network station and no existing news department, unlike the vast majority of its sister stations). WVTM was exempted in Birmingham, as, in the summer of 1995, New World sold WBRC as well as WGHP to Fox Television Stations, with WBRC switching to Fox after its affiliation contract with ABC expired on August 31, 1996 (Fox's purchases of WBRC and WGHP – the latter of which switched to the network when its contract with ABC expired on September 1, 1995 – were finalized on January 17, 1996). KNSD (also a UHF station) also did not switch as Fox was already affiliated with a VHF station in the San Diego market, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico-based XETV-TV (channel 6, later a CW affiliate and now a Canal 5 station targeting Tijuana). Both KNSD and WVTM retained their NBC affiliations. New World planned to sell all three stations as well, in order to comply with the FCC's twelve-station ownership limit. In November 1994, New World sold WSBK-TV to the Paramount Stations Group subsidiary of Viacom (which turned it into a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN), a new network launched on January 16, 1995, in partnership with Viacom subsidiary Paramount Television).\n\nMeanwhile, the transfer/assignment applications of the Argyle stations were not filed with the FCC until some time after New World had already completed its purchases of the four Citicasters stations on September 9 and October 12, 1994 (the former being the consummation date for the WDAF and KSAZ purchases, and the latter for the WGHP and WBRC purchases). New World began operating the Argyle stations through time brokerage agreements on January 19, 1995; the acquisition of the Argyle stations was completed on April 14, following the trust transfers of WBRC and WGHP.\n\nLater that year Brandon Tartikoff, who helped NBC out of its ratings doldrums in the 1980s in his former role as President of Entertainment at NBC, joined New World Communications in an executive position; concurrently, New World acquired Tartikoff's production company Moving Target Productions. New World also acquired the remaining interest in Genesis Entertainment, which expanded upon New World's production assets into television distribution (Genesis has subsequently renamed New World-Genesis Distribution following the closure of the purchase).\n\nLater in 1995, the company signed a distribution deal with NBC (\"Access Hollywood\" was the only program that came out of the agreement) in exchange for renewing the NBC affiliations for WVTM and KNSD in ten-year deals. That year also saw the acquisitions of Cannell Entertainment and entertainment magazine \"Premiere\" (the latter of which was purchased in a joint venture between New World and Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., which assumed New World's interest following its merger with News Corporation). In May 1996, New World sold WVTM and KNSD to NBC Television Stations for $425 million; the two stations became owned-and-operated stations of NBC when the deal became final on August 14.\n\nOn July 17, 1996, Fox parent News Corporation announced that it would acquire the remainder of New World Communications for $2.48 billion in stock. When the merger with News Corporation was finalized on January 22, 1997, New World's television production and distribution arms folded into 20th Century Fox Television and 20th Television, respectively and the former New World television stations were transferred into its Fox Television Stations subsidiary, turning the former group's twelve Fox affiliates into owned-and-operated stations of the network, joining WGHP and WBRC. The \"New World Communications\" name has lived on since then by the stations involved in the purchase that remain under Fox Television Stations ownership, under the names \"New World Communications of (city or state)\" or \"NW Communications of (city or state)\", originally used solely in copyright tags seen during the closing of each station's newscasts (except from 2007 to June 2009 as a result of Fox's December 2007 sale of eight owned-and-operated stations – including former New World stations WJW, KTVI, WDAF-TV, WITI-TV, WBRC and WGHP – to Local TV, which itself would merge with Tribune Broadcasting in December 2013) and since late June 2009, in FCC license filings as the legal licensee names for these stations.\nThe New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation libraries were acquired by Saban Entertainment and Fox Kids Worldwide (in turn acquired by Disney through its 2001 purchase of Fox Family Worldwide) following News Corporation's acquisition of New World.\n\nNew World still exists as a legal holdings entity under Fox Corporation for the former New World television stations that are now operating as Fox owned-and-operated affiliates; New World Pictures, however, was folded to 20th Century Fox, which is now owned by The Walt Disney Company.\n\nStations are arranged alphabetically by state and by city of license.\n\nNotes:\n\nThese films are currently owned by Shout! Factory and Ace Film HK Company.\nMost of these films are currently owned by Vine Alternative Investments.\nThe rights to New World Television's programs are owned by Vine Alternative Investments (pre-1990 programs), Sony Pictures Television (1990–1991 programs), and The Walt Disney Company (post-1991 programs), with some exceptions.\n"}

Cynllo was known for \"...the sanctity of his life and the austerity of his manners.\" \n\nCynllo is variously described in the genealogical \"Bonedd y Saint\" as the son of Usyllt and brother of Teilo. Later genealogies have him a grandson of Coel Hen. Wade-Evans thought he should be identified with \"Kentinlau\" who accompanied Saint Cadfan from Brittany to Ceredigion. References to him as \"Cynllo Vrenin\" (Cynllo the King) suggest that he was in possession of his ancestral dominions before devoting himself to religious life.\n\nCynllo's knee imprints, made as he said his devotions, are said to exist in a rock, near the farm Felin Gynllo, which lies just outside Llangoedmor in Ceredigion. A Middle Welsh poem, \"The Consolations of Elffin\", attributed to the infant Taliesin includes the line, \"Ni bydd coeg gweddi Cynllo\", \"The prayer of Cynllo will not be in vain.\"\n\nSeveral churches are dedicated in his honour, but there is no reliable account of him. Churches and chapels were dedicated to him over almost the whole of Gwerthrynion and Maelienydd. \n\nThere are churches in Ceredigion commemorating Saint Cynllo at Llangynllo (said to stand on the site of his monastic cell) and Nantcwnlle, and also the church of St Cynllo in the community of Nantmel in the historic county of Radnorshire, now part of Powys. The latter was almost totally rebuilt in the late 18th century. Cynllo was so popular that even when the Normans changed the dedication of the church in Rhayader to Saint Clements, locals still held Cynllo’s feastday there.\n\nNear St Cynllo's Church, Llanbister was a spring called \"Pistyll Cynllo\".\n\nBy the fifteenth century St. Cynllo's feast day had been set as 17 July, although Baring-Gould, quoting the sixteenth century \"Haford\" MS, shows August 8. \n\nCynllo does not appear on the Roman Catholic National Calendar for Wales, although every parish is encouraged to celebrate its patronal feast. The calendar indicates that \"Where no other indication is given the celebration is an optional memorial.\" \n\nA new calendar for the Church in Wales was produced in 2003; Cynllo does not appear in that either although both the Catholic and Anglican calendars have a general commemoration in November for Welsh saints. Those parishes which continue to commemorate Cynllo appear to conform to the 17 July.\n\n\n"}

It dates roughly to the same time as his monumental \"Death and the Maiden Quartet\", emerging around three years after his previous attempt to write for the string quartet genre, the Quartettsatz, D 703, that he never finished.\n\nStarting in 1824, Schubert largely turned away from the composition of songs to concentrate on instrumental chamber music. In addition to the A-minor String Quartet, the Quartet in D minor, the Octet, the Grand Duo and \"Divertissement a la Hongroise\" (both for piano duet), and the Sonata for Arpeggione and Piano all date from that year. With the exception of the Grand Duo, all of these works display cyclic elements—that is, two or more movements in each work are deliberately related in some way to enhance the sense of unity. In the case of the A-minor Quartet, a motive from the third-movement Minuet becomes the most important melodic figure for the following finale .\n\nSchubert dedicated the work to Schuppanzigh, who served as the first violinist of the string quartet appointed by Beethoven. Schuppanzigh himself played in the premiere performance which took place on 14 March 1824.\n\nThe quartet consists of four movements which last around 30 minutes in total.\n\n\nThe first movement opens with a texture reminiscent of the melancholic theme from one of Schubert's earliest songs, \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" and also quotes \"Schöne Welt, wo bist du?\" The reference to \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" is not a direct quotation, but rather is a similarity in the second violin’s restless accompanimental figuration, hovering around the mediant and underpinned by a repeated figure in cello and viola, which precedes the first thematic entrance. This also recalls the accompaniment to the first subject of the \"Unfinished\" Symphony (; ).\n\nIt is the second movement, however, which has lent the Quartet its nickname, being based on a theme from the incidental music for \"Rosamunde\" (a similar theme appears in the Impromptu in B-flat written three years later). The dactyl-spondee rhythm pervading this movement unmistakably shows the influence of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony . The form of this slow movement uses the same modified exposition-recapitulation form found in the slow movement of Schubert's \"Great\" C-major Symphony, where an ambiguity of formal definition is created by the introduction of a developmental passage shortly after the return of the primary theme in the recapitulation .\n\nThe minuet quotes the melody of another song by Schubert, \"Die Götter Griechenlandes\", D. 677, from November 1819, a connection only first noticed more than a century after the work's composition by Willi . The opening of this melody recurs in\ninversion at the beginning of the trio, and is later echoed in the opening of the finale .\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1826 (39th out of 41).\n\nHe fought in the Second Seminole War under William J. Worth from 1837 to 1842. During the Mexican–American War he fought at the Battle of Contreras and Battle of Churubusco, and was appointed brevet major on August 20, 1847 for gallant conduct. He then fought in the Battle of Molino del Rey and was severely wounded during the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13, 1847. In 1880 Casey became a veteran member of the Aztec Club of 1847—a military society originally composed of officers who had served in the occupation of Mexico City and later extended its membership to all United States officers who had served during the Mexican War and their descendants.\n\nAfter the Mexican-American War, he performed frontier duties and escorted topographical parties, including a trip to California around Cape Horn in 1849. He commanded at Camp Picket during the Pig War on San Juan Island from August 10 to October 18, 1859.\n\nCasey was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on August 31, 1861, shortly after arriving on the East Coast. He was promoted to colonel in the regular army on October 9. Casey eventually became a division commander in the IV Corps under Brig. Gen Erasmus Keyes. During the Battle of Seven Pines, Casey's division was attacked by D.H. Hill's Confederates and driven from the field in panic. Gen. George McClellan blamed them for the disaster, in spite of the fact that it was the smallest, least experienced, and least well-equipped division in the army and clearly should not have been placed in such a vulnerable location as the Seven Pines crossroads. Casey was removed from division command and replaced by Brig. Gen John J. Peck. For the remainder of the Peninsula Campaign, Casey and his former division were relegated to a post around army headquarters at Harrison's Landing and kept away from the front lines. After the Seven Days battles, when McClellan conducted a review of the army, the soldiers in Casey's division turned their backs and refused to cheer him. He was promoted to major general of volunteers on July 27 (to rank from July 4) in general promotion of all the army's corps and division commanders.\n\nHe wrote the three-volume \"System of Infantry Tactics\", including \"Infantry Tactics\" volumes I and II, published by the army on August 11, 1862, and \"Infantry Tactics for Colored Troops\", published on March 9, 1863. The manuals were used by both sides during the Civil War.\n\nIn December 1862 he was appointed to the board that ultimately convicted Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter of disobedience and cowardice for his actions at the Second Battle of Bull Run.\n\nAt the end of the war, Casey received a brevet (honorary promotion) to the rank of major general date March 15, 1865. He was mustered out of volunteer service and reverted to his regular army rank of colonel on August 24, 1865.\n\nCasey retired from the army on July 8, 1868, at the age of 61, having served over 40 years on active duty.\n\nIn 1870, he became a hereditary member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati in succession to his uncle Dr. Lincoln Goodale.

The character appears in stories set in the Marvel Universe, commonly in association with the X-Men. She is the older sister of Emma Frost, Christian Frost and Cordelia Frost.\n\nAdrienne Frost first appeared in \"Generation X\" #48 (February, 1999). The issue was scripted by Jay Faerber and drawn by Terry Dodson.\n\nAdrienne was the first child born to Hazel and Winston Frost. Siblings Christian, Emma and Cordelia followed. The Frost home was not one of love and kindness but one of mind games and control. Adrienne established herself as the \"perfect child\" and was the favorite of their cold and emotionless father, hoping to gain his favor and inherit the Frost family fortune.\n\nAdrienne was a power monger and showed little remorse or emotion when hurting her siblings both emotionally and physically. At an early age Adrienne discovered her mutant ability of psychometry: the ability to touch an object and instantly know the object's history in terms of events surrounding its past, present, and future owners. Her power revealed to her what she had always known: Winston, her father had little intention of dividing his fortune between all of his children. Instead, he planned to pick the child who he perceived as being able to guide his company into a state of growth and prosperity.\n\nThis simply reinforced her original beliefs and she became cold and distant to the world, the only people who were worth anything were those she could manipulate in her chess game of power. Her power allowed her to become an 'A' student and excel in all her endeavors, continuing to earn her father's favor. However, Emma's rebellion against their father lead to Winston developing a profound new interest in her. To demoralize her, Adrienne outed Christian, to whom Emma was closest, and set in motion the events that led to his attempted suicide. She also exposed Emma's kiss with her teacher Ian Kendall, which resulted in him being fired. In retaliation, Emma shocked her sister by exposing Adrienne's secret modeling career, of which their father disapproved.\n\nDespite her plans Adrienne had no control over the fact that her father saw Emma as akin to him when he was young. Confident, Adrienne gathered with her siblings for her father to reveal who would guide his finances into the next millennium. Believing herself to be the prime candidate, Adrienne was shocked when their father chose Emma as his heir. However, sick of her father's manipulations, Emma chose to leave and make it on her own, leaving Adrienne as the second choice.\n\nAdrienne continued living under her father, at times even suffering his physical abuse. She continued to resent Emma and their father, going so far as to release to the media a ransom video of Emma that had been sent to their father. Winston, having disowned Emma, wished to ignore the video, but was placed in the public eye by Adrienne's actions.\n\nAfter this, it is unknown what happened to her parents. Adrienne assumed control of Frost Enterprises, using her powers to increase her wealth and power. She married and later murdered her husband, Steven, with whom she frequently clashed.\n\nEmma approached Adrienne seeking to borrow money after her Massachusetts Academy had fallen into debt. Initially turning Emma down because of their history, Adrienne accepted her offer after using her powers to learn that the academy was secretly the home for Generation X. She became co-headmistress of the Massachusetts Academy and convinced her sister to re-open the school to the public to raise the funds necessary to keep the school open. As a result of the new human student body, Generation-X was forced to wear uniforms that hid their identities. She also gave Generation X new and sometimes questionable assignments, intentionally putting them in harm's way. The first of these assignments was to retrieve a sword from Madripoor that she had used to kill her husband. Her real intentions for accepting Emma's offer then surfaced. Using a combination of her powers and the Danger Room, she trapped Generation X in a simulation recreating Emma's earlier students The Hellions' demise at the hands of Trevor Fitzroy. She had hoped to drive Emma insane by watching another group of her students die. While Emma and Generation X were able to escape this illusion, Adrienne, now calling herself the new White Queen, escaped by using a teleportation device concealed as a necklace around her neck.\n\nAdrienne went to London where she successfully embezzled millions from the London branch of the Hellfire Club. She then began to plot her revenge on Emma by returning to the school, demanding that she be reinstated as headmistress or she would expose the school as a mutant sanctuary. She revealed the school's mutant students regardless, starting riots among human students, and later planted bombs at the school aimed at killing a maximum number of students - a plot that was only foiled by the sacrifice of Synch, who died containing the blasts.\n\nEmma later confronted Adrienne, who made it clear that she intended to escalate the violence and endanger more students. Recognizing that her powers did not work on Adrienne, Emma shot her in the chest. Emma then hid Adrienne's death from her students, going so far as to psychically mindwipe an investigating policeman. Emma then inherited Adrienne's fortune and Frost Enterprises. Their discovery of Adrienne's murder at Emma's hands caused Generation X to no longer trust Emma.\n\nAdrienne appeared once more—as that of a mental illusion to her sister Emma, who was having conflicting emotions about having killed her. In the end, however, Emma realized she was not sorry that she had killed Adrienne, only that she didn't kill her before she endangered her students.\n\nAdrienne had the mutant ability of psychometry. She was able to touch an object and instantly know a history of many events concerning the object, such as all of its previous owners, events that took place around the object, and the possible future of the object and its future owners. It allowed Adrienne to gather otherwise private information which she turned towards investigation, extortion, and espionage.\n\nAdrienne was also completely immune to her sister Emma's telepathy. \nShe was also an exceptionally skilled and intelligent business woman and expert manipulator.\n\n"}
{"id": "2065697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065697", "title": "Jack Birkenshaw", "text": "Jack Birkenshaw\n\nJack Birkenshaw, (born 13 November 1940) was an English cricketer, who later stood as an umpire and worked as a coach. Cricket commentator, Colin Bateman, stated \"Jack Birkenshaw was the epitome of a good all-round county cricketer: a probing off-spinner who used flight and guile, a handy batsman who could grind it out or go for the slog, a dependable fielder and great competitor\".\n\nBorn on 13 November 1940, in Rothwell, near Leeds, Yorkshire, Birkenshaw attended John Lawrence cricket school at Rothwell from the age of seven, and when aged 14 he appeared for Rothwell Grammar School and Yorkshire Schools. He was also a stand-off in the school rugby team. He played cricket for Lofthouse, Farsley and Leeds.\n\nBirkenshaw played a single County Championship match for Yorkshire at the age of 17 in 1958, taking the wicket of Jim Parks in both innings, but did not make another first-class appearance until 1959. That year he took 40 wickets at an average of 27.39, and also played for Minor Counties against the touring Indians; he made a second and final Minor Counties appearance against the South Africans the following year. In all, he played thirty games for Yorkshire, but failed to win his county cap, and in 1961 he moved on to Leicestershire.\n\nFor a long while Birkenshaw's performances for Leicestershire were rather disappointing. In his first six years at the club he never took more than 27 wickets in a season, and he had to rely on some useful lower-order contributions with the bat to keep his place in the side. He earned a place in the history books by playing (exclusively as a batsman) in the pioneering Midlands Knock-Out Cup limited-overs tournament in 1962. However, he was capped by the county in 1965, and greater success was lying ahead.\n\nIn 1967, Birkenshaw took 111 wickets – in the previous six seasons combined he had managed 102 in total – at an average of only 21.41. He took five in an innings on five occasions, including 7–86 against Sussex, and gained selection for the International XI that toured Pakistan in the winter. 1968 proved another good season for Birkenshaw, as he again took 100 wickets, and punished Sussex again: this time with the bat as he made 101 not out. He made two more centuries the following year, but surprisingly for a man who passed fifty on 57 occasions in first-class cricket, he was to reach three figures just once more in his career. The years between 1969 and 1972 saw Birkenshaw record solid statistics, taking 69, 63, 89 and 90 wickets in successive seasons, and in 1972 he achieved his career-best bowling of 8–94 against Somerset.\n\nSuch performances attracted the interest of the England selectors, who had previously stuck by Ray Illingworth as their first-choice off-spinner, and Birkenshaw was picked to go to India and Pakistan in 1972/73. He made 64 on his debut in the fourth Test against India at Kanpur, and also claimed three wickets; his first victim in Test cricket was Sunil Gavaskar. Birkenshaw retained his place for the fifth Test at Bombay, and opened the batting in the second innings, but lost his place for the Pakistan series and played only in the third Test, taking 5–55 and sharing the second-innings wickets equally with Norman Gifford.\n\nDespite another decent domestic season in 1973, Birkenshaw was omitted from the England side for both series that summer (against New Zealand and West Indies), the 41-year-old Illingworth again being the barrier to his selection. However, there was no Illingworth on the winter tour to the Caribbean, and Birkenshaw played in the last two Tests. A total return of 2–96 and 15 runs in three innings was not enough to keep his place for the summer of 1974, and that was as far as his England career lasted.\n\nHe played on for Leicestershire for a number of years, helping them win the County Championship in 1975, making his fourth and final first-class hundred, and recording his best bowling figures in one-day cricket, taking 5–20 against Essex in the Sunday League. Oddly, these were the only wickets he took in the 11 one-day games he played that year. In 1976, Birkenshaw made his only one-day hundred, but his unbeaten 101 against Hampshire in the second round of the Gillette Cup failed to win the game, Leicestershire falling short of their target by three runs.\n\nBirkenshaw finished with Leicestershire in 1980, but had one final season in the game with Worcestershire. In his penultimate match he made 32 and 54 against the Australian tourists, and his final first-class match came in late July 1981 against Northamptonshire. The first wicket of his first-class career had been that of a famous Test player, and with a pleasing symmetry the last was to be too: Kapil Dev, caught behind for 79. This match was also notable for being the first first-class game to be held at Stourbridge for 19 years.\n\nAfter retirement, Birkenshaw became an umpire, standing in over 250 matches from 1982 to 1988 including two Tests and six One Day Internationals, four of the latter being at the 1983 World Cup. His last game as an umpire was the Refuge Assurance Cup final in September 1988. He later returned to his old county of Leicestershire in the capacity of coach, after a similar spell at Somerset. As coach, he led the county to the County Championship title in 1996 and 1998.\n\nBirkenshaw was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2065730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065730", "title": "Martyrs of Córdoba", "text": "Martyrs of Córdoba\n\nThe Martyrs of Córdoba were forty-eight Christian martyrs who were executed under the rule of Muslim conquerors in what is now southern Spain. At the time the area was known as Al-Andalus. The hagiography describes in detail the executions of the martyrs for capital violations of Islamic law, including apostasy and blasphemy. The martyrdoms related by Eulogius (the only contemporary source) took place between 851 and 859.\n\nWith few exceptions, the Christians knowingly risked execution by making public statements proclaiming their Christianity in the presence of Muslims. Some of the martyrs were executed for blasphemy after they appeared before the Muslim authorities and denounced Muhammad, while others who were Christian children of Muslim–Christian marriages publicly proclaimed their Christianity and thus were executed as apostates. (Coope 1995). Still others who had previously converted to Islam denounced their new faith and returned to Christianity, and thus were also executed as apostates.\n\nThe lack of another source after Eulogius's own martyrdom has given way to the misimpression that there were fewer episodes later in the 9th century.\n\nIn 711 AD, a Muslim army from North Africa had conquered Visigoth Christian Iberia. Under their leader Tariq ibn-Ziyad, they landed at Gibraltar and brought most of the Iberian Peninsula under Islamic rule in an eight-year campaign. The Iberian Peninsula was called al-Andalus by its Muslim rulers. When the Umayyad Caliphs were deposed in Damascus in 750, the dynasty relocated to Córdoba, ruling an emirate there; consequently the city gained in luxury and importance, as a center of Iberian Muslim culture.\n\nOnce the Muslims conquered Iberia, they governed it in accordance with Islamic law. Blasphemy and apostasy from Islam were both capital offenses. In Islam, blasphemy includes insulting Muhammad and the Muslim faith. Apostasy is the crime of converting away from Islam. Under Islamic law, anyone whose father is Muslim is automatically a Muslim at birth and will be automatically be guilty of apostasy if they proclaim any faith other than Islam. Anyone found guilty of either blasphemy or apostasy was swiftly executed.\n\nDuring this time, Christians could retain their churches and property on condition of paying a tribute (\"jizya\") for every parish, cathedral, and monastery; frequently such tribute was increased at the will of the conqueror. Christians also had to abstain from any public displays of their faith in the presence of Muslims, as such an act was considered blasphemy under Islamic law and punishable by death.\n\nMany Christians fled to Northern Spain; others took refuge in the monasteries of Sierras. Still others converted in order to gain favor or avoid the \"jizya\", and thus the number of Christians shrank eventually to small proportions.\n\nIn 786 the Muslim caliph, Abd-er Rahman I, began the construction of the great mosque of Córdoba, now a cathedral, and compelled many Christians to take part in the preparation of the site and foundations. The executions of the martyrs caused tension not only between Muslims and Christians, but within the Christian community. Abd er-Rahman II at first ordered the arrest and detention of the clerical leadership of the local Christian community. As the civil disobedience seemed to subside, the clergy were released in November 851. When several months later there was a new wave of protests, the emir turned again to the Christian leaders as the ones most capable of controlling the Christian community. Instead of imprisoning them, he ordered them to convene a council in Córdoba to review the matter and develop some strategy for dealing with the dissidents internally. He gave the bishops a choice: Christians could stop the public dissent or face harassment, loss of jobs, and economic hardship. Upon the death of Abd-er Rahman II in 852, his son and successor, Muhammad I removed all Christian officials from their palace appointments.\nReccafred, Bishop of Córdoba, urged compromise with the Muslim authorities. Eulogius, who has been venerated as a saint from the 9th century, viewed the bishop as siding with Muslim authorities against the Christians. The closures of monasteries where some of the martyrs had lived occurred towards the middle of the 9th century.\n\nThe monk Eulogius encouraged the public declarations of the faith as a way to reinforce the faith of the Christian community and protest the Islamic laws that Christians saw as unjust. He composed tractates and martyrologies, of which a single manuscript, containing his \"Documentum martyriale\", the three books of his \"Memoriale sanctorum\" and his \"Liber apologeticus martyrum\", was preserved in Oviedo, in the Christian kingdom of Asturias in the far northwestern coast of Hispania. The relics of Eulogius were moved there in 884.\n\nWolf points out that it is important to distinguish between the motivations of the individual martyrs, and those of Eulogius and Alvarus in writing the \"Memoriale\". Jessica A. Coope says that while it would be wrong to ascribe a single motive to all forty-eight, she suggests that it reflects a protest against the process of assimilation. They demonstrated a determination to assert Christian identity. Wolf maintains that it is necessary to view the actions of the martyrs in the context of the penitential aspect of 9th century Iberian Christianity. \"Martyrdom was in fact a perfect solution... Not only did it epitomize self-abnegation and separation from the world, but it guaranteed that there would be no opportunity to sin again.\"\n\nThe forty-eight Christians (mostly monks) were martyred in Córdoba, between the years 850 AD and 859 AD, being decapitated for publicly proclaiming their Christian beliefs. Dhimmis (non-Muslims living under Muslim rule) were not allowed to speak of their faith to Muslims under penalty of death.\n\nThe detailed \"Acta\" of these martyrs were ascribed to the aptly named \"Eulogius\" (\"blessing\"), who was one of the last two to die. Although most of the martyrs of Córdoba were Hispanic, either Baeto-Roman or Visigothic, one name is from Septimania, another Arab or Berber, and another of indeterminate nationality. There were also connections with the Orthodox East: one of the martyrs was Syrian, another an Arab or Greek monk from Palestine, and two others had distinctive Greek names. The Greek element recalls the Byzantine interlude of power in southernmost Hispania Baetica, until they were finally expelled in 554: representatives of the Byzantine Empire had been invited to help settle a Visigothic dynastic struggle, but had stayed on, as a hoped-for spearhead to a \"Reconquest\" of the far west envisaged by emperor Justinian I.\n\nThe following list is from Kenneth Wolf's \"Christian Martyrs in Muslim Spain\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2065753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065753", "title": "Botch (band)", "text": "Botch (band)\n\nBotch was an American metalcore band formed in 1993 in Tacoma, Washington. The band, featuring Brian Cook, Dave Knudson, Tim Latona and Dave Verellen, spent four years as a garage band and released several demos and EPs before signing to Hydra Head Records. Through the label, Botch released two studio albums: \"American Nervoso\" (1998) and \"We Are the Romans\" (1999). The group toured extensively and internationally in support of their albums with liked-minded bands such as The Blood Brothers, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Ink & Dagger and Jesuit. Botch struggled to write a third studio album, and in 2002 the group broke up due to tensions among the band members and creative differences. Hydra Head posthumously released an EP of songs the group had been working on before they split titled \"An Anthology of Dead Ends\" and a live album documenting their final show titled \"061502\" in 2006.\n\nAfter Botch broke up, most of the members went on to form or join new bands in the Seattle/Tacoma area including: Minus the Bear, Narrows, Roy, Russian Circles and These Arms Are Snakes. \n\nWhile Botch was well-received by music critics and cited as an influence on numerous hardcore bands in the years following their breakup, the group was generally overlooked by the local Washington underground hardcore scene. The group spent their active years \"poking fun\" at the local music scene by avoiding common clichés. Rejecting contemporaneous trends in hardcore, Botch eschewed the usual \"skull and crossbones\" aesthetic and ubiquitous \"chugga-chugga\" riffs for a stripped-down, confessional presentation and complex arrangements.\nBassist Brian Cook, guitarist Dave Knudson, drummer Tim Latona and vocalist Dave Verellen formed Botch in 1993 while they were all still in high school. Tim Latona, who at the time was a jazz drummer considering attending the performing arts school Juilliard, was approached by Dave Knudson in the high school cafeteria and asked if he would like to start a rock band. According to Knudson, \"We were probably 16 or 17. I brought my amp over to Tim's house, and we ended up on his back deck playing Helmet covers for a couple of hours.\" Dave Knudson enticed Brian Cook to join the band by promising that the group would record a Dead Kennedys cover, but this recording never took place. Dave Verellen was the last to join the band, and only became the vocalist because he couldn't play an instrument. The group selected the name Botch simply by \"opening a dictionary.\"\n\nEarly songs written by Botch were described by Knudson as, \"some of the worst music you've probably heard in your life,\" which he attributed to each of the members' differing tastes in music and the lack of experience in composing songs. Some of their early song titles included: \"Barney the Purple Dinosaur,\" \"Vegetarianism Is Anarchy,\" \"Barbed Rectal Thermometer\" and \"Pudenda.\"\n\nBotch released \"Faction\", a 7\" EP in 1995; that same year, Botch went on their first tour outside of the Seattle-area. Dave Verellen's dad drove the group on a mini-tour through Canada in an old van he owned. John Pettibone, then of Undertow and Nineironspitfire, praised Botch's ability to tour outside of their hometown, commenting: \"Botch was the first band from the next generation that went out and pushed it—and pushed it \"their\" way. It was remarkable.\" In 1996, the band released another EP, titled \"The John Birch Conspiracy Theory\".\n\nIn early 1997, Botch went on a seven-week tour throughout the United States and Canada with Ink & Dagger and Nineironspitfire, which gained them a significant amount of exposure. According to Brian Cook, \"Ink & Dagger were kind of a big deal at that point, so we were playing a lot of club shows. I think we did a show at some theater in Buffalo, New York, with Snapcase and there were, like, a thousand people or something like that.\" Also in 1997, Excursion Records released \"The Unifying Themes of Sex, Death and Religion\"—a nine-track compilation album composed of the EPs \"The John Birch Conspiracy Theory\" and \"Faction\" in their entirety, and \"Closure\" from the various artists compilation \"I Can't Live Without It\".\n\nAaron Turner, former vocalist for the post-metal band Isis and founder of the record label Hydra Head Records, was following Botch's early career. He praised the group's interpretation of Carl Orff's classical piece \"O Fortuna\" off of \"The John Birch Conspiracy Theory\" EP, describing it as \"amazing\" and also saying that, \"anytime I made a mix tape for someone else, I'd put ['O Fortuna'] on there.\" Turner contacted Botch and asked them to contribute a song to Hydra Head's \"In These Black Days\"—a compilation album of Black Sabbath cover songs released as a series of split singles. Botch recorded a cover of \"The Wizard\" from Black Sabbath's 1970 album \"Black Sabbath\", and also sent Turner a demo album they had been working on at the time. About the demo, Aaron Turner said, \"I can't remember if I had solicited it or if they just sent it to me. In any event, it was more than I was expecting from them even though I already thought they were good. I think I gave them about six or seven grand to do the record, which was probably more than I had given any other band that we had worked with at that point.\"\n\nThe demos were re-recorded with Matt Bayles at Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard's own Studio Litho. After three days of recording and two days of mixing, the completed songs became Botch's debut studio album \"American Nervoso\", released in 1998 through Hydra Head Records. In support of \"American Nervoso\", Botch headlined a North American tour with The Dillinger Escape Plan and Jesuit. Beginning with this tour, John Pettibone was hired as the group's manager, and it also was Botch's first time bringing their own lighting equipment with them. Their stage setup included several halogen work lamps plugged into a power strip with a switch. Commenting on the lights, Dave Verellen said, \"I hated the lights at clubs, which were always on the band, so we figured we'd turn them on the audience. [...] I liked it because I could see people's reaction in the crowd because their faces were totally illuminated.\" Also during this tour, Botch played music from the girl group Destiny's Child before they went on stage, which was intentionally drastically different from the more traditional \"metal music [being played] in between the metal bands.\" Botch were also rumored to be recording a Destiny's Child covers EP—however, this release never materialized.\n\nIn 1999, Botch recorded some live demos with Matt Bayles for their second studio album and follow up to \"American Nervoso\". Two months later, Botch returned to Litho Studios with Bayles to record what would become \"We Are the Romans\". The group only had approximately one week to track the album, and according to Knudson, the group \"[rushed] to get everything done and do it as well as we wanted to.\" As a last minute addition to the album, Botch rewrote and rerecorded the song \"Frequenting Mass Transit\"—originally released on a split release with Murder City Devils—and changed the title to \"Frequency Ass Bandit\". \"We Are the Romans\" was released in November 1999 through Hydra Head Records on both CD and double LP vinyl formats. The title of the album was derived from the lyrics to the album's closing track \"Man the Ramparts\". According to Verellen: \"Brian [Cook] thought it'd make a great title, but I thought it was a totally silly gladiator song. The riff is kinda huge, so I was thinking about chariots and fire and stuff like that. It sounds like I pulled the words out of \"Conan the Barbarian\". But then we started talking about the social decline of Western civilization, and how Americans are the new Romans—it's all slaves and Caesars. So we made it work.\"\n\nBotch's first show in support of \"We Are the Romans\" was the final show for the Seattle venue Rkcndy with The Blood Brothers, Playing Enemy and Kill Sadie in October 1999. The club was an all-ages venue that was being demolished to make way for a hotel. Verellen expressed his admiration for playing all-ages shows stating that, \"People go to all-ages shows to see the bands, but people will go to bars... and while they're at the show, they're just hanging out with their friends. That doesn't mean all bar shows are like that, but that's what makes me not want to play bars, basically.\" In 2000, Botch toured Europe with The Dillinger Escape Plan, and also went on a smaller North American tour later that year. In 2001, Botch performed at Louisville, Kentucky's hardcore festival Krazy Fest 4 which also featured Coalesce, Converge, Poison the Well and Harkonen among others.\n\nBotch officially decided to break up the band in February 2002. Tensions between Tim Latona and Dave Knudson that originated from the \"We Are the Romans\" sessions and supporting tours built up to the point where members weren't communicating anymore. According to Dave Verellen, \"it was the best idea for us just to break up while we were on top of things, rather than torture ourselves and keep chipping away till we hated each other.\" Botch also struggled to write a third studio album citing pressures to write a follow up to their critically acclaimed \"We Are the Romans\" and suffering from \"crazy writer's block.\" Knudson had also begun writing softer-sounding songs that didn't fit Botch's style, and formed the side-project Minus the Bear in 2001. Botch performed their final show on June 15, 2002 at The Showbox in downtown Seattle, Washington with The Blood Brothers, Harkonen and Playing Enemy.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of a reunion in a 2002 interview with the band, Dave Verellen said, \"I'd be first in line to keep this goddamn band together.\" However, in the same interview, Knudson said, \"I could totally see doing anything with any of those people that's not Botch but something else that's creative and fun... and maybe more aggressive.\" In a 2009 interview with Brian Cook, he revealed that Botch get asked to play reunion shows \"on a regular basis.\" After Botch disbanded, Cook maintained that he would never reunite the band, but in a 2014 interview, he revealed that the other members of Botch felt like the band ended too early and that they had been urging him to stop saying the word \"never\" regarding a possible reunion.\n\nBefore disbanding, Botch recorded a six-song EP titled \"An Anthology of Dead Ends\"—a small collection of songs Botch had written before breaking up. The EP was recorded in March 2002, an event which was described by producer Matt Bayles as being \"incredibly tense.\" On the album's content, Verellen said: \"Two of the tracks are things we did live that we just wanted to record\" and one of the songs was \"just a riff we never got a song written for, but it was just such a good riff.\" Hydra Head Records released \"An Anthology of Dead Ends\" on October 15, 2002; about four months after Botch played their final show. Also in 2002, Excursion Records reissued \"The Unifying Themes Of Sex, Death, And Religion\" under the name \"Unifying Themes Redux\" with seven additional tracks from Botch's split albums and compilation contributions.\n\nIn July 2006, Hydra Head announced they would release four Botch albums over the next year. The label first reissued the compilation album \"Unifying Themes Redux\" on September 26, 2006. A live two-disc set titled \"061502\" was released on December 5, 2006. The CD/DVD package features a live recording of Botch's final performance from June 15, 2002 at The Showbox. A remastered version of \"American Nervoso\" was released on July 7, 2007. This updated version was also packaged with various bonus features, including demos and extended versions of some tracks. For example, parts of the song \"Hives\" that were accidentally removed on the original recording were added back. And finally, Hydra Head Records released a two-disc remastered version of \"We Are the Romans\" on September 11, 2007. The second disc featured demo versions of \"We Are the Romans\" tracks and four live songs.\n\nIn September 2011, Hydra Head announced that they discovered approximately 450 vinyl record jackets for \"We Are the Romans\" in their storage space, and would repress the record using the album's original plates. After the records sold out in less than 20 minutes, the label stated they would make Botch reissues a \"priority for 2012.\" For Record Store Day in 2012, Hydra Head reissued \"An Anthology of Dead Ends\" on vinyl. To commemorate the 10-year anniversary of Botch's final show, Hydra Head released a limited edition windbreaker that was only available for 24 hours on June 15, 2012. In March 2016, Hydra Head released a limited-edition vinyl set featuring all previously released LP editions of Botch's albums spread across nine discs compiled in a silver-foil stamped box featuring a 36-page extended liner note booklet.\n\nAfter Botch broke up, three of the four members continued to compose and perform music with new bands—drummer Tim Latona instead chose to continue his education. The complex tree of interchanging band members among these newly formed groups has been described as \"incestuous.\"\n\nKnudson continued performing with the math rock/indie rock band Minus the Bear with vocalist Jake Snider formerly of Sharks Keep Moving, drummer Erin Tate formerly of Kill Sadie, former Botch producer Matt Bayles on keys, and bassist Cory Murchy. Minus the Bear quickly signed to Suicide Squeeze Records and released two EPs, \"This Is What I Know About Being Gigantic\" and \"Bands Like It When You Yell \"Yar!\" at Them\", before releasing their debut full-length \"Highly Refined Pirates\" in November 2002. The group released two more albums through Suicide Squeeze, \"Menos el Oso\" (2005) and \"Planet of Ice\" (2007), before signing to Dangerbird Records and releasing \"Omni\" (2010) and \"Infinity Overhead\" (2012).\n\nThe post-hardcore group These Arms Are Snakes was formed in 2002 by Brian Cook, Steve Snere formerly of Kill Sadie, Ryan Frederiksen of formerly of Nineironspitfire, Joe Preston and Jesse Robertson. The group signed to Jade Tree Records and released the EP \"This Is Meant to Hurt You\" (2003) and their debut full-length \"Oxeneers or the Lion Sleeps When Its Antelope Go Home\" (2004). These Arms Are Snakes went through a few lineup changes, one of which included Erin Tate of Minus the Bear and Kill Sadie, before solidifying their lineup with Chris Common on drums. With this formation, they released two more albums, \"Easter\" (2006) and \"Tail Swallower and Dove\" (2008)—the later of which was released on Suicide Squeeze Records—before disbanding in 2009.\n\nAside from working as a firefighter, Dave Verellen also formed the folk rock band Roy in 2002 with Brian Cook, Ben Verellen of Harkonen and Mike Cooper. The group released the EP \"Tacomatose\" (2003) and the full-length \"Big City Sin and Small Town Redemption\" (2004) before going on hiatus. During the break, Cook and Ben Verellen worked on These Arms Are Snakes' debut album \"Oxeneers or the Lion Sleeps When Its Antelope Go Home\". Roy briefly reformed and released \"Killed John Train\" in 2006.\n\nBrian Cook also joined the instrumental post-rock group Russian Circles in 2007, replacing former member Colin DeKuiper. Cook contributed to Russian Circles' second and third studio albums \"Station\" (2008) and \"Geneva\" (2009); both of which were released through Suicide Squeeze Records. The group then signed to Sargent House and released \"Empros\" (2011) and \"Memorial\" (2013). As of 2014, Brian is a part of Sumac (band), as a touring bassist with Aaron Turner and Nick Yacyshyn. They have released their debut album The Deal in February 2015.\n\nIn 2008, vocalist Dave Verellen formed the mathcore band Narrows with Rob Moran of Unbroken and Some Girls, Sam Stothers of Makeout Boys, Jodie Cox of Bullet Union, and Ryan Frederiksen of These Arms Are Snakes and Nineironspitfire. Narrows signed to Deathwish Inc. and subsequently released a self-titled EP (2008) and two full-lengths: \"New Distances\" (2009) and \"Painted\" (2012).\n\nBotch's music was a major early influence on the mathcore and metalcore styles, and their final album \"We Are the Romans\" is specifically cited as a highly influential album. \"Decibel\" and \"Rock Sound\" both inducted the album into their publication's \"Hall of Fame\" features in November 2005 and August 2011 respectively. \"Rock Sound\" also declared \"We Are the Romans\" as one of the \"big four\" math metal albums in May 2008, and featured Botch in the publication's \"Revolutionaries\" column, which pays tribute to \"the bands we just couldn't live without\" in November 2006. In August 2005, \"Alternative Press\" listed \"We Are the Romans\" as a classic \"other punk album\"—or an album that was influential, but not commercially successful. In October 2009, Botch was featured in AbsolutePunk's \"Weekly Nostalgia\" piece, which pays tribute to disbanded musical groups. In November 2009, Jason Heller listed \"We Are the Romans\" as one of the albums that didn't make \"The A.V. Club\"'s top 50 albums of previous decade list, but was still an important album of this period. In 2012, \"Rock Sound\" added Botch's \"We Are the Romans\" into its \"101 Modern Classics,\" ranking at number 35.\n\nMany artists have cited Botch's music as an influence or have expressed their admiration for it, including: American Standards, Architects, Jordan Blilie of The Blood Brothers, Dan Briggs of Between the Buried and Me, Breather Resist, Cancer Bats, Curl Up and Die, The Fall of Troy, Johnny Truant, Frank Turner of Million Dead, Norma Jean, The Ocean, Owl City, and Underoath. In January 2009, members of the Washington bands Kane Hodder and Schoolyard Heroes formed a tribute band and performed Botch songs at a local venue in a one-off performance. \n\nDespite Botch's level of acclaim after their demise, the group was initially poorly received by the local Washington hardcore scene. For the majority of their existence, \"the band found themselves shunned by cliques and crews.\" Latona described the negative reaction as \"disheartening,\" and that Botch thought the group, \"had something cool to share with people, and they were total assholes to us.\" In the late 1990s, the group's complex music wasn't seen as very accessible, and their constant \"poking fun at the scene\" wasn't warmly received by their peers. In addition to playing complex music, Botch actively avoided common hardcore stereotypes. Before walking on stage, Botch warmed up the crowd with pop music instead of heavier music. Botch sold a t-shirt that featured two shirtless homosexual males sitting close on a couch with the words \"Botch: The Best Boy Band Ever\" written directly below. Cook designed the shirt by tracing an image out of a homosexual pornographic magazine and \"drew a beer bottle over the cock,\" which was meant to be a \"rebellion against all the typical skull and switchblade imagary\" that is prevalent in the hardcore scene. Botch wrote songs such as \"C. Thomas Howell as the 'Soul Man'\" which openly mocked straight-edge bands like Racetraitor and other bands with \"lofty political ideals.\" Botch also cited living in Tacoma, Washington and being isolated from Seattle as another reason for not being accepted into any regional music scenes. In a 2011 interview with \"Rock Sound\", Dave Verellen said \"A lot of Seattle didn't like us, so we just did what we did,\" and that when \"We Are the Romans\" was released, \"people were like, 'Yeah, it's good...' but like anything in that genre at the time it was a slow-starter because it wasn't exactly palatable. Hydra Head was stoked on it and, slowly, we started to get more press and play bigger shows. But even this week I've talked to more people about that record than I have since it came out.\"\n\nThe members of Botch have mixed feelings about their posthumous acclaim. In regards to what fans are willing to pay for out-of-print merchandise on eBay, Latona said \"I don't mean to sound like a dick, but it's like, 'Where were you in 2001?'\" but also continued by saying \"On the other hand, it's flattering to hear that people even give a shit about what we did, because I fucking loved what we did.\" Knudson also said the continued interest in Botch was \"flattering,\" but that \"It would have been great if there were a ton of people at our shows in 98, but that's now how it goes.\" The members of Botch aren't impressed with many of the bands who they inspired, often describing these new acts as ripping them off. Knudson admitted to ripping off Soundgarden and Sepultura while writing for Botch, but said that playing the songs that you love is part of progressing as a musician, and that \"Sometimes you can make [copying another band] into your own thing and then own it—which is how I feel we did it.\" Cook said being ripped off really bummed him out, and that:\n\nBotch's musical genre is typically described as noisecore or metallic hardcore. The group's technically and complexly composed music, along with their use of odd time signatures, often garners them the label of mathcore or math rock. \n\nInspired by bands like Helmet and Alice in Chains, when Botch formed they started playing in drop D tuning. According to Brian Cook, in this tuning, \"you could play a power chord with one finger. Right away I was like, 'Fuck.' I was 16 and barely knew how to play the instrument, and all of a sudden it was tuned differently than what I was used to.\" Early demos were described as sounding like \"chuggachugga straight-edge hardcore-style stuff.\" While Botch was still searching for its own identity, the members contemplated becoming a straight edge band for a period of time. All of the members admired the Seattle straight edge group Undertow—one of the biggest names in the Seattle hardcore scene at the time. Cook also expressed appreciation for the first albums of the vegan straight edge band Earth Crisis. On the group's feelings toward straight edge, Cook said:\n\nKnudson's guitar playing was influenced by the \"crazy and angular\" bands Angel Hair and Drive Like Jehu—the latter of which was seen as an early influence on mathcore—and the heavier bands Sepultura, Soundgarden and Meshuggah.\n\nFinal line-up\n\nRelated figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2065768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065768", "title": "Antimicrobial peptides", "text": "Antimicrobial peptides\n\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also called host defense peptides (HDPs) are part of the innate immune response found among all classes of life. Fundamental differences exist between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may represent targets for antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are potent, broad spectrum antibiotics which demonstrate potential as novel therapeutic agents. Antimicrobial peptides have been demonstrated to kill Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria , enveloped viruses, fungi and even transformed or cancerous cells. Unlike the majority of conventional antibiotics it appears that antimicrobial peptides frequently destabilize biological membranes, can form transmembrane channels, and may also have the ability to enhance immunity by functioning as immunomodulators.\n\nAntimicrobial peptides are a unique and diverse group of molecules, which are divided into subgroups on the basis of their amino acid composition and structure. Antimicrobial peptides are generally between 12 and 50 amino acids. These peptides include two or more positively charged residues provided by arginine, lysine or, in acidic environments, histidine, and a large proportion (generally >50%) of hydrophobic residues. The secondary structures of these molecules follow 4 themes, including i) α-helical, ii) β-stranded due to the presence of 2 or more disulfide bonds, iii) β-hairpin or loop due to the presence of a single disulfide bond and/or cyclization of the peptide chain, and iv) extended. Many of these peptides are unstructured in free solution, and fold into their final configuration upon partitioning into biological membranes. It contains hydrophilic amino acid residues aligned along one side and hydrophobic amino acid residues aligned along the opposite side of a helical molecule. This amphipathicity of the antimicrobial peptides allows them to partition into the membrane lipid bilayer. The ability to associate with membranes is a definitive feature of antimicrobial peptides although membrane permeabilization is not necessary. These peptides have a variety of antimicrobial activities ranging from membrane permeabilization to action on a range of cytoplasmic targets.\n\nThe modes of action by which antimicrobial peptides kill microbes are varied, and may differ for different bacterial species. Some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills \"E. coli\" and several filamentous fungi. The cytoplasmic membrane is a frequent target, but peptides may also interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. The initial contact between the peptide and the target organism is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, such as in the antimicrobial peptide Piscidin. Their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by ‘barrel-stave’, ‘carpet’ or ‘toroidal-pore’ mechanisms. Alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. Intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. However, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. One emerging technique for the study of such mechanisms is dual polarisation interferometry. In contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic. In general the antimicrobial activity of these peptides is determined by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits bacterial growth.\n\nAMPs can possess multiple activities including anti-gram-positive bacterial, anti-gram-negative bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, and anti cancer activities. A big AMP functional analysis indicates that among all AMP activities, amphipathicity and charge, two major properties of AMPs, best distinguish between AMPs with and without anti-gram-negative bacterial activities. This implies that being AMPs with anti-gram-negative bacterial activities may prefer or even require strong amphipathicity and net positive charge.\n\nIn addition to killing bacteria directly they have been demonstrated to have a number of immunomodulatory functions that may be involved in the clearance of infection, including the ability to alter host gene expression, act as chemokines and/or induce chemokine production, inhibiting lipopolysaccharide induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting wound healing, and modulating the responses of dendritic cells and cells of the adaptive immune response. Animal models indicate that host defense peptides are crucial for both prevention and clearance of infection. It appears as though many peptides initially isolated as and termed \"antimicrobial peptides\" have been shown to have more significant alternative functions in vivo (e.g. hepcidin). Dusquetide for example is an immunomodulator that acts through p62, a protein involved in toll like receptor based signalling of infection. The peptide is being examined in a Phase III clinical trial by Soligenix (SGNX) to ascertain if it can assist in repair of radiation-induced damage to oral mucosa arising during cancer radiotherapy of the head and neck.\n\nAntimicrobial peptides possessing a net positive charge are attracted and incorporated into negatively charged bacterial membranes. Once inside the membrane, they are believed to cause disruption through three possible mechanisms:\n\n\nAlthough the specifics of each mechanism differ, all propose peptide-induced membrane rupture, allowing cytoplasmic leakage that ultimately leads to death.\n\nRecent work has painted a more complex picture of antimicrobial peptide activity. Antimicrobial peptides may also function as metabolic inhibitors, inhibitors of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibitors of cell wall synthesis or septum formation. They are also known to cause ribosomal aggregation and delocalize membrane proteins.\n\nAdding a further layer of complexity, many natural antimicrobial peptides possess weak bactericidal activity. Rather than directly inhibit bacterial growth, they are now known to act in concert with the host immune system through mechanisms including chemokine induction, histamine release, and angiogenesis modulation. These immunomodulatory effects have only recently begun to receive attention.\n\nSeveral methods have been used to determine the mechanisms of antimicrobial peptide activity. In particular, solid-state NMR studies have provided an atomic-level resolution explanation of membrane disruption by antimicrobial peptides. In more recent years, X-ray crystallography has been used to delineate in atomic detail how the family of plant defensins rupture membranes by identifying key phospholipids in the cell membranes of the pathogen. Human defensins have been thought to act through a similar mechanism, targeting cell membrane lipids as part of their function. In fact human beta-defensin 2 have now been shown to kill the pathogenic fungi \"Candida albicans\" through interactions with specific phospholipids. From the computational point of view, the molecular dynamics simulations can shed light in the molecular mechanism and the specific peptide interactions with lipids, ions and solvent.\nAntimicrobial peptides have been used as therapeutic agents; their use is generally limited to intravenous administration or topical applications due to their short half-lives. As of January 2018 the following antimicrobial peptides were in clinical use: \n\nAMPs have been observed having functions other than bacterial and fungal killing. These activities include antiviral effects, but also roles in host defence such as anticancer functions and roles in neurology. This has led to a movement for re-branding AMPs as \"Host-defence peptides\" to encompass the broad scope of activities AMPs can have.\n\nSome cecropins (e.g. cecropin A, and cecropin B) have anticancer properties and are called anticancer peptides (ACPs). Hybrid ACPs based on Cecropin A have been studied for anticancer properties. The fruit fly Defensin prevents tumour growth, suspected to bind to tumour cells owing to cell membrane modifications common to most cancer cells, such as phosphatidylserine exposure.\n\nRecently there has been some research to identify potential antimicrobial peptides from prokaryotes, aquatic organisms such as fish and shellfish, and monotremes such as echidnas.\n\nIn the competition of bacterial cells and host cells with the antimicrobial peptides, antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with the bacterial cell to the mammalian cells, which enables them to kill microorganisms without being significantly toxic to mammalian cells. Selectivity is a very important feature of the antimicrobial peptides and it can guarantee their function as antibiotics in host defense systems.\n\nWith regard to cancer cells, they themselves also secrete human antimicrobial peptides including defensin, and in some cases, they are reported to be more resistant than the surrounding normal cells.\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that selectivity is always high against cancer cells.\n\nThere are some factors that are closely related to the selectivity property of antimicrobial peptides, among which the cationic property contributes most. Since the surface of the bacterial membranes is more negatively charged than mammalian cells, antimicrobial peptides will show different affinities towards the bacterial membranes and mammalian cell membranes.\n\nIn addition, there are also other factors that will affect the selectivity. It's well known that cholesterol is normally widely distributed in the mammalian cell membranes as a membrane stabilizing agents but absent in bacterial cell membranes; and the presence of these cholesterols will also generally reduce the activities of the antimicrobial peptides, due either to stabilization of the lipid bilayer or to interactions between cholesterol and the peptide. So the cholesterol in mammalian cells will protect the cells from attack by the antimicrobial peptides.\n\nBesides, the transmembrane potential is well known to affect peptide-lipid interactions. There's an inside-negative transmembrane potential existing from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of the cell membranes and this inside-negative transmembrane potential will facilitate membrane permeabilization probably by facilitating the insertion of positively charged peptides into membranes. By comparison, the transmembrane potential of bacterial cells is more negative than that of normal mammalian cells, so bacterial membrane will be prone to be attacked by the positively charged antimicrobial peptides.\n\nSimilarly, it is also believed that increasing ionic strength, which in general reduces the activity of most antimicrobial peptides, contributes partially to the selectivity of the antimicrobial peptides by weakening the electrostatic interactions required for the initial interaction.\n\nThe cell membranes of bacteria are rich in acidic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. These phospholipid headgroups are heavily negatively charged. Therefore, the outmost leaflets of the bilayer which is exposed to the outside of the bacterial membranes are more attractive to the attack of the positively charged antimicrobial peptides. So the interaction between the positive charges of antimicrobial peptides and the negatively charged bacterial membranes is mainly the electrostatic interactions, which is the major driving force for cellular association. In addition, since antimicrobial peptides form structures with a positively charged face as well as a hydrophobic face, there are also some hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids (electrically neutral) surface of the bacterial membranes, which act only as a minor effect in this case.\n\nIn contrast, the outer part of the membranes of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges since most of the lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes. Thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, even though a small portion of the membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged gangliosides. Therefore, the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic face of amphipathic antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids on the cell surface of mammalian cell membranes plays a major role in the formation of peptide-cell binding. However, the hydrophobic interaction is relatively weak when compared to the electrostatic interaction, thus, the antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with bacterial membranes.\n\nDual polarisation interferometry has been used \"in vitro\" to study and quantify the association to headgroup, insertion into the bilayer, pore formation and eventual disruption of the membrane.\n\nA lot of effort has been put into controlling cell selectivity. For example, attempts have been made to modify and optimize the physicochemical parameters of the peptides to control the selectivities, including net charge, helicity, hydrophobicity per residue (H), hydrophobic moment (μ) and the angle subtended by the positively charged polar helix face (Φ). Other mechanisms like the introduction of D-amino acids and fluorinated amino acids in the hydrophobic phase are believed to break the secondary structure and thus reduce hydrophobic interaction with mammalian cells. It has also been found that Pro→Nlys substitution in Pro-containing β-turn antimicrobial peptides was a promising strategy for the design of new small bacterial cell-selective antimicrobial peptides with intracellular mechanisms of action. It has been suggested that direct attachment of magainin to the substrate surface decreased nonspecific cell binding and led to improved detection limit for bacterial cells such as \"Salmonella\" and \"E. coli\".\n\nBacteria use various resistance strategies to avoid antimicrobial peptide killing. Some microorganisms alter net surface charges. \"Staphylococcus aureus\" transports D-alanine from the cytoplasm to the surface teichoic acid which reduces the net negative charge by introducing basic amino groups. \"S. aureus\" also modifies its anionic membranes via MprF with L-lysine, increasing the positive net charge. The interaction of antimicrobial peptides with membrane targets can be limited by capsule polysaccharide of \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\". \nAlterations occur in Lipid A. \"Salmonella\" species reduce the fluidity of their outer membrane by increasing hydrophobic interactions between an increased number of Lipid A acyl tails by adding myristate to Lipid A with 2-hydroxymyristate and forming hepta-acylated Lipid A by adding palmitate. The increased hydrophobic moment is thought to retard or abolish antimicrobial peptide insertion and pore formation. The residues undergo alteration in membrane proteins. In some Gram-negative bacteria, alteration in the production of outer membrane proteins correlates with resistance to killing by antimicrobial peptides. Non-typeable \"Hemophilus influenzae\" transports AMPs into the interior of the cell, where they are degraded. Furthermore, \"H. influenzae\" remodels its membranes to make it appear as if the bacterium has already been successfully attacked by AMPs, protecting it from being attacked by more AMPs. ATP-binding cassette transporters import antimicrobial peptides and the resistance-nodulation cell-division efflux pump exports antimicrobial peptides. Both transporters have been associated with antimicrobial peptide resistance. Bacteria produce proteolytic enzymes, which may degrade antimicrobial peptides leading to their resistance. Outer membrane vesicles produced by Gram-negative bacteria bind the antimicrobial peptides and sequester them away from the cells, thereby protecting the cells. The outer membrane vesicles are also known to contain various proteases, peptidases and other lytic enzymes, which may have a role in degrading the extracellular peptide and nucleic acid molecules, which if allowed to reach to the bacterial cells may be dangerous for the cells. Cyclic-di-GMP signaling had also been involved in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide resistance in \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\"\n\nWhile these examples show that resistance can evolve naturally, there is increasing concern that using pharmaceutical copies of antimicrobial peptides can make resistance happen more often and faster. In some cases, resistance to these peptides used as a pharmaceutical to treat medical problems can lead to resistance, not only to the medical application of the peptides, but to the physiological function of those peptides.\n\nThe ‘Trojan Horse’ approach to solving this problem capitalizes on the innate need for iron by pathogens. “Smuggling” antimicrobials into the pathogen is accomplished by linking them to siderophores for transport. While simple in concept, it has taken many decades of work to accomplish the difficult hurdle of transporting antimicrobials across the cell membranes of pathogens. Lessons learned from the successes and failures of siderophore-conjugate drugs evaluated during the development of novel agents using the ‘Trojan horse’ approach have been reviewed.\n\nAntimicrobial peptides are produced by species across the tree of life, including: \n\n\nResearch has increased in recent years to develop artificially-engineered mimics of antimicrobial peptides such as SNAPPs, in part due to the prohibitive cost of producing naturally-derived AMPs. An example of this is the facially cationic peptide C18G, which was designed from the C-terminal domain of human platelet factor IV. Currently, the most widely used antimicrobial peptide is nisin; being the only FDA approved antimicrobial peptide, it is commonly used as an artificial preservative.\n\nSeveral bioinformatic databases exist to catalogue antimicrobial peptides such as ADAM (A Database of Anti-Microbial peptides), APD (Antimicrobial Peptide Database), BioPD (Biologically active Peptide Database), CAMP (Collection of sequences and structures of antimicrobial peptides), DBAASP (Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides) and LAMP (Linking AMPs).\n\nThe Antimicrobial peptide databases may be divided into two categories on the basis of the source of peptides it contains, as specific databases and general databases. These databases have various tools for antimicrobial peptides analysis and prediction. For example, CAMP contains AMP prediction, feature calculator, BLAST search, ClustalW, VAST, PRATT, Helical wheel etc. In addition, ADAM allows users to search or browse through AMP sequence-structure relationships. Antimicrobial peptides often encompass a wide range of categories such as antifungal, antibacterial, and antituberculosis peptides.\n\ndbAMP : Provides an online platform for exploring antimicrobial peptides with functional activities and physicochemical properties on transcriptome and proteome data. dbAMP is an online resource that addresses various topics such as annotations of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) including sequence information, antimicrobial activities, post-translational modifications (PTMs), structural visualization, antimicrobial potency, target species with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), physicochemical properties, or AMP–protein interactions.\n\nTools such as PeptideRanker, PeptideLocator, and AntiMPmod allow for the prediction of antimicrobial peptides while others have been developed to predict antifungal and anti-Tuberculosis activities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2065788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065788", "title": "Bedford Park, Bronx", "text": "Bedford Park, Bronx\n\nBedford Park is a residential neighborhood in the northwest Bronx, New York City, between the New York Botanical Garden and Lehman College. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are: Mosholu Parkway to the north, Webster Avenue to the east, East 196th Street to the south, and the Jerome Reservoir (south of Sedgwick Avenue) and Goulden Avenue (Sedgwick Avenue and north) to the west.\n\nThe neighborhood is part of Bronx Community District 7, and its ZIP Codes include 10458 and 10468. The area is patrolled by the 52nd Precinct of the New York City Police Department.\n\nThe area now known as Bedford Park was mostly farmland outside the town of Kingsbridge, then an unincorporated suburb of New York City. The area began to be developed with the construction of the Jerome Park Racetrack, for thoroughbred horse racing, by Leonard Jerome and August Belmont, Sr. in 1866. Jerome Park Racecourse became the first home of the famous Belmont Stakes horse race, until 1890. To attract the wealthy to the racecourse, Leonard Jerome built what is today Jerome Avenue. In 1874 the town of Kingsbridge was officially incorporated into New York City.\n\nIn 1890, Jerome Park Racecourse was sold. Construction was started to convert it into the Jerome Park Reservoir, to store fresh water from the New Croton Aqueduct. At the same time, the neighborhood of Bedford Park was beginning to take shape. Forty \"villas\" (suburban houses) were built on a stretch, in a planned community, named Villa Avenue.\n\nThe area became a part of the newly created Borough of the Bronx in 1898. The Italian and Irish immigrants who worked on the Jerome Park Reservoir project soon anchored the community there. In 1906, 200th Street was renamed Bedford Park Boulevard, likely named after Edward Thomas Bedford, a director of Standard Oil, president of the Bank of the State of New York, who was an associate of Leonard Jerome.\n\nDevelopment continued with the completion of the Grand Concourse, a multilane thoroughfare, in 1914; and the extension of subway to the area with the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (present-day ) in 1917. The Grand Concourse saw a boom in housing construction in the post-World War I era. Much of this was from middle-class (primarily Jews, Italians, and Irish) moving from Manhattan.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, when widespread poverty, crime, arson, and drug use were prevalent across the Bronx, Bedford Park was not hit as hard as many other neighborhoods in the more southern parts of the borough. This was largely due to community activists and organizers taking an aggressive stance on drugs and demanding increased law enforcement in the area.\n\nBased on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Bedford Park was 54,415, a change of -914 (-1.7%) from the 55,329 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 6.7% (3,637) White, 18% (9,805) African American, 0.3% (145) Native American, 5% (2,727) Asian, 0.1% (29) Pacific Islander, 0.9% (490) from other races, and 1.1% (623) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 67.9% (36,959) of the population.\n\nThe entirety of Community District 7, which includes Bedford Park, Jerome Park, Fordham, Kingsbridge Heights and Norwood, had 148,163 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.4 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 26% are between the ages of between 0–17, 31% between 25–44, and 23% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 11% and 9% respectively.\n\nAs of 2017, the median household income in Community District 7 was $35,355. In 2018, an estimated 26% of Bedford Park and Norwood residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in seven residents (14%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 61% in Bedford Park and Norwood, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Bedford Park and Norwood are considered low-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.\n\nBedford Park is home to people of many ethnicities including Korean, Indians, and Bangladeshis. Reflecting a population greatly composed of foreign-born immigrants, there are distinct ethnic enclaves in Bedford Park. On 204th Street, between the Grand Concourse and Mosholu Parkway lies a small cluster of Korean restaurants, groceries, social clubs, and other businesses.\n\nBedford Park's ethnic diversity manifests itself in an assortment of ways besides the formation of enclaves. Among the national symbols one may see strolling the neighborhood include the double-headed eagle (the emblem of Albania), the icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe (sacred to Catholic Mexicans), the shamrock of Ireland, the Arabic calligraphy of the shahadah (the Muslim profession of faith), or the coquí of Puerto Rico. A vast assortment of newspapers are sold in local convenience stores, including \"The Irish Echo\", Albanian-language \"Bota Sot\" of Kosovo, and the Spanish-language local newspapers \"El Diario/La Prensa\", and \"El Hoy\".\n\nBedford Park is dominated by 5- or 6-story apartment buildings and three-story Victorian houses. The apartments on the Grand Concourse are often taller. Tracey Towers are two 41-story subsidized apartment buildings built close to the Jerome Park Reservoir. Designed by noted architect Paul Rudolph, they were completed in 1972 as a part of New York City's Mitchell Lama housing development initiative. The total land area is a little less than half a square mile.\n\nIn the 2016 Presidential election, most precincts in Bedford Park voted for the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton, over her Republican Party opponent Donald Trump.\n\nBedford Park is in New York's 16th congressional district. Before redistricting in 2012, it included the West Bronx and South Bronx; after redistricting, it includes parts of the northern Bronx and southern Westchester County. The district is represented by Eliot Engel .\n\nBedford Park is patrolled by the 52nd Precinct of the NYPD, located at 3016 Webster Avenue. The 52nd Precinct ranked 49th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. With a non-fatal assault rate of 97 per 100,000 people, Bedford Park's rate of violent crimes per capita is greater than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 583 per 100,000 people is higher than that of the city as a whole.\n\nThe 52nd Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 78.4% between 1990 and 2019. The precinct reported 8 murders, 34 rapes, 363 robberies, 564 felony assaults, 184 burglaries, 726 grand larcenies, and 78 grand larcenies auto in 2019.\n\nBedford Park contains a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire station, Engine Co. 79/Ladder Co. 37/Battalion 27, at 2928 Briggs Avenue.\n\nPreterm births are less common in Bedford Park and Norwood than in other places citywide, though teenage births are more common. In Bedford Park and Norwood, there were 85 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 30.3 teenage births per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide). Bedford Park and Norwood has a relatively average population of residents who are uninsured. In 2018, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 16%, higher than the citywide rate of 12%.\n\nThe concentration of fine particulate matter, the deadliest type of air pollutant, in Bedford Park and Norwood is , more than the city average. Twelve percent of Bedford Park and Norwood residents are smokers, which is lower than the city average of 14% of residents being smokers. In Bedford Park and Norwood, 33% of residents are obese, 19% are diabetic, and 35% have high blood pressure—compared to the citywide averages of 24%, 11%, and 28% respectively. In addition, 25% of children are obese, compared to the citywide average of 20%.\n\nEighty-four percent of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is less than the city's average of 87%.

Peters VA Medical Center in Kingsbridge Heights, North Central Bronx Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center in Norwood.\n\nBedford Park is divided into two ZIP Codes. The area west of Grand Concourse is located within 10468, while the area east of Grand Concourse is in 10458. The United States Postal Service operates two post offices near Bedford Park: the Botanical Station at 2963 Webster Avenue and the Van Cott Station at 3102 Decatur Avenue.\n\nBedford Park and Norwood generally have a lower rate of college-educated residents than the rest of the city. While 23% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, 32% have less than a high school education and 45% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 26% of Bronx residents and 43% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Bedford Park and Norwood students excelling in math rose from 21% in 2000 to 48% in 2011, and reading achievement increased from 28% to 33% during the same time period.\n\nBedford Park and Norwood's rate of elementary school student absenteeism is more than the rest of New York City. In Bedford Park and Norwood, 28% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, higher than the citywide average of 20%. Additionally, 70% of high school students in Bedford Park and Norwood graduate on time, lower than the citywide average of 75%.\n\nBedford Park sports an \"Educational MIle,\" a group of schools and a college located along the Jerome Park Reservoir. There are three high schools there (Walton, DeWitt Clinton, and Bronx Science), along with two elementary schools and the Bronx campus of Hunter College (now Lehman College). After end of World War II, in 1946 Hunter College's Bronx Campus served briefly as host of the United Nations. Currently, two of the nine specialized high schools in New York City are in the area, which includes Bronx High School of Science and the High School of American Studies at Lehman College. There was also a small private high school, Bedford Park Academy (founded in 1932, sold to Grace Lutheran Church in 1981), and a private Lutheran elementary school, Grace Lutheran School, which closed in 2006.\n\nThe Convent of Mount St. Ursula is located on Bedford Park Boulevard and Bainbridge Avenue. It was established by a group of Roman Catholic nuns from the Ursuline order in 1892. The Academy of Mount St. Ursula High School, an all-girls prep-school, is located there today; the order is also associated with the St Philip Neri Elementary School. It recently celebrated its 150th anniversary with the class of 2005. The academy is now the oldest, all female Catholic school in New York state. In the 1930s, unclaimed land near the Jerome Park Reservoir offered opportunities for New Deal-related construction to alleviate unemployment from the Great Depression.\n\nOne of the most notable places in the neighborhood is Lehman College, which was originally Hunter College's uptown campus. The Works Progress Administration built the original four buildings of the campus in grey stone in the Collegiate Gothic style, with finials, turrets, and other decorative features. Additional buildings, including the Lehman Library and Center for the Performing Arts, were added in the style of modern architecture. The newest building, the APEX, has facilities for athletics and dance. The scenic campus, which spans into Kingsbridge, has been used as a shooting location for episodes of the television series Law & Order and its spin-offs.\n\nBedford Park also has two specialized high schools, The Bronx High School of Science (\"Bronx Science\") and the High School of American Studies at Lehman, as well as Clinton High School, a non-specialized high school. These schools use Harris Field, a public ballpark, for athletic activities.\n\nThe New York Public Library (NYPL) operates the Mosholu branch at 285 East 205th Street. The branch opened in 1955 and contains two floors: a ground floor and a basement.\n\nAmong Bedford Park's oldest buildings are its churches and other religious institutions. The oldest church in the area, Bedford Park Congregational Church at the corner of Bainbridge Avenue and East 201st Street, dates to 1882. Its American Queen Anne-style design hints at Bedford Park's origin as a small rural community. It was designated a City Landmark in 2000. (New York City Landmarks Commission 2005)\n\nOn the Grand Concourse lies the Roman Catholic Church of St. Philip Neri (Bronx, New York). The church was dedicated to the Italian saint due to its origin as a church for immigrant Italian laborers, who also worked on the construction of the Jerome Park Reservoir. The cornerstone of the church (dated 1899) was in fact quarried from what became Jerome Park Reservoir, and brought there by a horse-drawn carriage. (Greene 2002) When built and for many years thereafter, this parish served an Italian and Irish congregation. On June 13, 1997, the church suffered a massive fire, and was given major renovation into the mid-2000s.\n\nThe following New York City Subway stations serve Bedford Park:\n\nThe Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line also serves Bedford Park via the Botanical Garden station at Mosholu Parkway.\n\nThe most notable roads in the area include Jerome Avenue, Grand Concourse, Bedford Park Boulevard, Sedgwick Avenue, and Mosholu Parkway.\n\n\nOther smaller but still noteworthy streets in Bedford Park include Goulden Avenue, which runs north-south along the Jerome Reservoir; Gun Hill Road, a major street that clips the corner of the neighborhood; Webster Avenue, which is just over the border in Bronx Park; and 198th Street, which is just across the border in Kingsbridge.\n\nThe following MTA Regional Bus Operations bus routes serve Bedford Park:\n\nBedford Park is also served by the following Bee-Line Bus System routes to Westchester County, New York:\n\n\n"}

The term has been associated historically with [biological control] – and by implication – the manipulation of living organisms. Regulatory positions can be influenced by public perceptions, thus:\nThey are obtained from organisms including plants, bacteria and other microbes, fungi, nematodes, \"etc\". They are often important components of integrated pest management (IPM) programmes, and have received much practical attention as substitutes to synthetic chemical plant protection products (PPPs).\n\nBiopesticides can be classified into these classes-\n\nBiopesticides have usually no known function in photosynthesis, growth or other basic aspects of plant physiology. Instead, they are active against biological pests. Many chemical compounds have been identified that are produced by plants to protect them from pests so they are called antifeedants. These materials are biodegradable and renewable alternatives, which can be economical for practical use. Organic farming systems embraces this approach to pest control.\n\nRNA interference is under study for possible use as a spray-on insecticide by multiple companies, including Monsanto, Syngenta, and Bayer. Such sprays do not modify the genome of the target plant. The RNA could be modified to maintain its effectiveness as target species evolve tolerance to the original. RNA is a relatively fragile molecule that generally degrades within days or weeks of application. Monsanto estimated costs to be on the order of $5/acre.\n\nRNAi has been used to target weeds that tolerate Monsanto's Roundup herbicide. RNAi mixed with a silicone surfactant that let the RNA molecules enter air-exchange holes in the plant's surface that disrupted the gene for tolerance, affecting it long enough to let the herbicide work. This strategy would allow the continued use of glyphosate-based herbicides, but would not per se assist a herbicide rotation strategy that relied on alternating Roundup with others.\n\nThey can be made with enough precision to kill some insect species, while not harming others. Monsanto is also developing an RNA spray to kill potato beetles One challenge is to make it linger on the plant for a week, even if it's raining. The Potato beetle has become resistant to more than 60 conventional insecticides.\n\nMonsanto lobbied the U.S. EPA to exempt RNAi pesticide products from any specific regulations (beyond those that apply to all pesticides) and be exempted from rodent toxicity, allergenicity and residual environmental testing. In 2014 an EPA advisory group found little evidence of a risk to people from eating RNA.\n\nHowever, in 2012, the Australian Safe Food Foundation posited that the RNA trigger designed to change the starch content of wheat might interfere with the gene for a human liver enzyme. Supporters countered that RNA does not appear to make it past human saliva or stomach acids. The US National Honey Bee Advisory Board told EPA that using RNAi would put natural systems at \"the epitome of risk\". The beekeepers cautioned that pollinators could be hurt by unintended effects and that the genomes of many insects are still unknown. Other unassessed risks include ecological (given the need for sustained presence for herbicide and other applications) and the possible for RNA drift across species boundaries.\n\nMonsanto has invested in multiple companies for their RNA expertise, including Beeologics (for RNA that kills a parasitic mite that infests hives and for manufacturing technology) and Preceres (nanoparticle lipidoid coatings) and licensed technology from Alnylam and Tekmira. In 2012 Syngenta acquired Devgen, a European RNA partner. Startup Forrest Innovations is investigating RNAi as a solution to citrus greening disease that in 2014 caused 22 percent of oranges in Florida to fall off the trees.\n\n\"Bacillus thuringiensis\", a bacteria capable of causing disease of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera, is a well-known insecticide example. The toxin from \"B. thuringiensis\" (Bt toxin) has been incorporated directly into plants through the use of genetic engineering. The use of Bt Toxin is particularly controversial. Its manufacturers claim it has little effect on other organisms, and is more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides.\n\nOther microbial control agents include products based on:\n\nVarious naturally occurring materials, including fungal and plant extracts, have been described as biopesticides. Products in this category include:\n\nBiopesticides are biological or biologically-derived agents, that are usually applied in a manner similar to chemical pesticides, but achieve pest management in an environmentally friendly way. With all pest management products, but especially microbial agents, effective control requires appropriate formulation and application.\n\nBiopesticides for use against crop diseases have already established themselves on a variety of crops. For example, biopesticides already play an important role in controlling downy mildew diseases. Their benefits include: a 0-Day Pre-Harvest Interval (see: maximum residue limit), the ability to use under moderate to severe disease pressure, and the ability to use as a tank mix or in a rotational program with other registered fungicides. Because some market studies estimate that as much as 20% of global fungicide sales are directed at downy mildew diseases, the integration of biofungicides into grape production has substantial benefits in terms of extending the useful life of other fungicides, especially those in the reduced-risk category.\n\nA major growth area for biopesticides is in the area of seed treatments and soil amendments. Fungicidal and biofungicidal seed treatments are used to control soil borne fungal pathogens that cause seed rots, damping-off, root rot and seedling blights. They can also be used to control internal seed–borne fungal pathogens as well as fungal pathogens that are on the surface of the seed. Many biofungicidal products also show capacities to stimulate plant host defence and other physiological processes that can make treated crops more resistant to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses.\n\n\n\n● Bioinsecticides Market (Acquire Market Research)\n\n"}

In the early versions of \"The Diary of Anne Frank\", she was given the pseudonym \"Elli Vossen\".\n\nBep was born in Amsterdam. She was one of the eight children of Johan Voskuijl and Christina Sodenkamp. When still a teenager, Bep worked as a chambermaid, waitress and shop assistant in order to earn money to support the large Voskuijl family. In 1937, Bep enrolled in the Amsterdam Institute Schoevers, the evening school for girls and women who wanted to learn secretarial work. Bep excelled at her courses in German, stenography and accounting. Soon after, she was hired by Otto Frank as a secretary for his company, Opekta, based at 263 Prinsengracht, the address which would become the Frank family's hiding place. She was eighteen when she started working and was the youngest employee in the office. Later, her unemployed father, who had health problems, became the Opekta warehouse supervisor. \n\nBep became close with Otto Frank's wife Edith Holländer and their daughters Margot and Anne. She also made friends with Miep Gies and got acquainted with Victor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman, all employees at Opekta who would later become helpers in the Secret Annex.\n\nOn Sunday 5 July 1942, Bep celebrated her 23rd birthday. The next day, when she went to work, the Frank family had already moved into the Secret Annex. For the next two years, her life was governed almost completely by her care for the people in hiding. Bep was responsible for milk and bread, and Bep's sister sewed garments such as pants and blouses for the people in hiding. She also ordered correspondence courses for those in hiding, such as shorthand and Latin.\n\nBep was lucky to have the support of her father, who was soon informed of the Secret Annex. Johan Voskuijl kept an eye on the situation in the warehouse, as the other employees were not let in on the secret. Johan would also make sure that the waste from the hiding place disappeared unnoticed in the morning. Furthermore, in August 1942, Voskuijl built the famous bookcase that concealed the entrance to the Secret Annex. Voskuijl and his daughter discussed the Annex a lot with each other, as they kept silent to the rest of the Voskuijl family for safety reasons. Bep also managed to keep her fiancé Bertus Hulsman ignorant for twenty-five months. She had taken him to Prinsengracht one Sunday, pretending to have to feed the cat. While she was visiting the hiders, Bertus had to wait in one of the offices, \"otherwise he would chase away the cat\".\n\nBep got on well with Anne and the feeling was mutual. In his memoirs, Otto Frank remembered about the friendship between his youngest daughter and Bep that \"the two (...) were frequently whispering to each other in a corner\". Anne considered Bep, who was ten years older, to be one of the \"young people\" and was very curious about Bep's experiences: the films she was seeing, but also how things were going between Bep and her fiancé. For lunch, Bep joined the people in the Secret Annex, because at home there was not always enough to eat for ten people. In her diary Anne characterized her as follows: \"Bep has a healthy appetite. Leaves nothing on her plate and is not picky and choosy. She is easy to please and that is just what pleases us. Cheerful and good-tempered, willing and good-natured, these are her characteristics.\"\n\nIn October 1942, Anne convinced Bep to spend a night in the Secret Annex, but Bep did not sleep a wink. \"To tell you the truth, I was terrified. Every time I heard a tree creaking in the October wind or a car driving along the canal, I grew afraid. I was grateful when morning came, and I was able to get back to work.\" During the evening of her stay, Bep had become acquainted with Anne's talent for writing, when she was given a few stories to read that Anne had come up with. In a letter to Otto Frank, she later remembered: \"I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I could not believe that Anne had written those words. I can still see Margot's face: 'Yes, Anne wrote these all by herself.' Then I thought, you've got to be older to be able to write such a thing, or perhaps it was her inner self that came out.\" Later, Anne would occasionally show Bep diary passages, although she carefully screened her notes from the eyes of the other hiders. Bep provided Anne with carbon paper she brought from the office.\n\nIn addition to her care for the people in hiding, Bep also had to take care of her father. In the spring of 1943, he became seriously ill and was no longer able to work for the company. On 15 June 1943, Anne Frank wrote: \"It is a disaster for us that good old Voskuyl won't be able to keep us in touch with all that goes on, and all he hears in the warehouse. He was our best helper and security adviser; we miss him very much indeed.\"\n\nDuring the Gestapo raid, Bep managed to escape with a few documents which would have incriminated their black market contacts. She went into hiding for a week and then got back to the office, after which she entered the Secret Annex and saved parts of Anne's diaries, that were scattered over the floor. A few days earlier, Miep had already saved Anne's red-checkered diary and a few other notebooks.\n\nBep was honored in later years for her activities during the Second World War, but disliked publicity and gave few interviews about her association with Anne Frank. However, she followed the news about Anne's diary closely and composed scrap books with newspaper articles and photo reports. In 1959, she also testified in Otto Frank's lawsuit against two Holocaust deniers in the German city of Lübeck. Together with Miep Gies, she gave statement to confirm that Anne had written her diary during the hiding.\n\nThat same year, Bep met with queen Juliana at the Dutch premiere of the film \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" by George Stevens. In a letter to Otto Frank, Bep admitted she would much prefer to \"distance herself from everything (...). Also, the pleasant things, such as invitations here and there, are never-racking before and after. You know, a loss for words plays the main role here. I know that you all mean well and certainly appreciate it and don't want to break with anyone in our Opekta circle. (...) I would do everything in my power to uphold the symbol of the idealized Anne, which for me (...) is combined with always thinking about what has happened, what I witnessed. This great pain never leaves my heart.\"\n\nBep kept in contact with Otto Frank even after his move to Switzerland and new marriage. Otto knew that Bep had troubles making ends meet and did his best to help her, too. He occasionally lent money to her. Bep also corresponded with Victor Kugler, who moved to Canada after the war. In 1978, she would visit him and his wife Lucy in Toronto.\n\nBep Voskuijl died in Amsterdam on 6 May 1983, due to a traumatic aortic rupture. She was 63 years old. In an article in Dutch national newspaper \"De Telegraaf\", Miep Gies was quoted, stating that \"the special thing about Bep was that she was so humble. She was heroic without bravura, simply assumed that the hiders in the Annex must be helped. For her, that wasn't a difficult choice to make.\"\n\nIn 2015, Belgian journalist Jeroen De Bruyn of the Flemish newspaper \"Gazet van Antwerpen\" and Joop van Wijk, Bep Voskuijl's youngest son, released their biography \"Bep Voskuijl, het zwijgen voorbij. Een biografie van de jongste helpster van het Achterhuis\". They were the first ones to provide in-depth information on Bep Voskuijl's life, such as her aid to the people in the Secret Annex, her special relationship with Anne Frank and her postwar life, which was highly influenced by her war past. In Belgium and the Netherlands, the biography received much media attention, mainly because the authors claimed that Bep's sister Nelly (1923–2001) could be seen as a suspect of the betrayal of the Secret Annex. According to De Bruyn and Van Wijk, Nelly worked for the Germans during the war and had several German soldiers among her friends. She also had a relationship with an Austrian non-commissioned officer. \n\nAccording to Bertus Hulsman, Bep's former fiancé, who was interviewed by the authors, Nelly knew that her father and sister hid Jews. The authors underline that Karl Silberbauer, the SS man who arrested the people of the Secret Annex, later claimed that the infamous call to the Germans was made by a female. They find it curious that Bep was strongly convinced of stockroom manager Willem van Maaren's guilt, but changed her mind when Simon Wiesenthal tracked down Silberbauer in 1963. After this period, Bep started avoiding the media.\n\nIn 2018, the English version of the biography was published under the title \"Anne Frank: The Untold Story. The hidden truth about Elli Vossen, the youngest helper of the Secret Annex\".\n\n\n\n"}

Animation from the early 1990s to mid-2000s; beginning with \"\" in 1992, and ending with \"Justice League Unlimited\" in 2006. Some parts of the associated media franchise including direct-to-video feature films and shorts, comic books, video games and other multimedia adaptations are also included in the continuity.\n\nWhile there have been several animated projects based upon DC Comics characters over the decades, what is commonly accepted as the DC animated universe consists of the stable of TV series and films that spin off from \"Batman: The Animated Series\" (1992–95), the first TV show in this continuity. Two characters outside of the normal Batman canon, Zatanna and Jonah Hex, appeared on the show, but the first series to indicate a shared continuity with other well-known characters was the subsequent show, \"\", in which the title character has encounters with heroes such as the Wally West Flash and Green Lantern Kyle Rayner.\n\nOlder shows such as \"Super Friends\" and newer shows such as \"The Batman\", \"Legion of Super Heroes\", \"\", \"Young Justice\" and \"Justice League Action\" are not part of this continuity. The direct-to-video DC Universe Animated Original Movies, such as \"\", \"\", and \"\" are also not considered part of the DCAU, despite utilizing similar character designs and several of them featuring much of the same voice cast as previous DCAU series.\nThe DC animated universe consists of these animated series (and their related films; see below):\n\nThe following animated feature films also are part of the DCAU continuity:\n\n\n\n\nAn animated series based on the \"Teen Titans\" comic books was planned for the DC animated universe during the mid-1990s, but was finally scrapped. Instead a \"Teen Titans\" series not related to the DC animated universe was released. Also, after the success of \"Batman: The Animated Series\" in the early 1990s, Fox approached producer Bruce Timm to create a spin-off series focusing on Catwoman, but the project never materialized.\n\nIn 1998, writer John P. McCann had been tasked with coming up with a Lobo animated series in the DC animated universe, with Brad Garret set to reprise his role as the character, but the show had been cancelled right before production. A few elements of the show would find it's way in the 2000 Lobo Webseries, an online Flash animated series starring Lobo, the galactic bounty hunter, however whether the webseries is part of the official DCAU is unclear. A wax statue with the same character design as Lobo in this series appeared in an episode of \"Gotham Girls\" which somewhat support that the webseries is part of the official DCAU, although this is still disputed. Unlike the other shows set in the DCAU, it has graphic violence, sexual content, strong profanity, and a lack of tie-ins with the greater DCAU.\nBefore the release of \"\", a third animated feature based on \"\" was planned, entitled \"Batman: Arkham\". The film was supposed to be a follow-up for \"\", and Boyd Kirkland was attached to write and direct; but the project was soon scrapped. A second \"Batman Beyond\" movie was planned for release but was finally scrapped due to the dark tones and controversies of \"\" in 2001. Around 2003, during the production of \"\", Warner Bros. approached Kirkland to write a Catwoman direct-to-video feature film as a tie-in with the 2004 live-action film. Although the script was written, the project was soon scrapped after the poor reception of the live-action film.\n\nAlso, a direct-to-video feature-length animated film entitled \"Justice League: Worlds Collide\" was planned to connect \"Justice League\" with its follow-up \"Justice League Unlimited\", but the production was finally cancelled in 2004, and the script was later rewritten for the animated film \"\", that was not part of the DC animated universe.\n\nMany of the DCAU productions have also had comic books created based on the characters of the various series, though their canonicity is disputable. The comics are:\n\nThere have also been a number of DCAU tie-in video games released to correspond with the various animated television series and films. Some of these games have original plots, while others follow previous stories; their status in DCAU canon is unknown. The games are:\nSix of these games feature voice acting from the casts of the original shows. These are: \"The Adventures of Batman and Robin\" (SEGA CD/Mega CD version), \"Superman\", \"Batman Vengeance\", \"Superman: Shadow of Apokolips\", \"Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu\", and \"View-Master Batman Animated VR\". The SEGA CD/Mega CD game, \"The Adventures of Batman and Robin\", also features animation from one of the studios that worked on \"Batman: The Animated Series\".\n\nThough the DCAU is an offshoot of the mainstream DC comics universe, it has also affected the DC universe in return. The following characters were originally created for their respective series in the DCAU, but were eventually adapted via retroactive continuity into the mainstream DC comic continuity:\n\n\nIn addition, the backstory of Mr. Freeze was adapted from his portrayal in \"Batman: The Animated Series\", and the visuals and/or characterization of Green Lantern, Supergirl, Toyman, Two-Face, Parasite, Metallo, Clayface, and many others have been applied to their comic counterparts. On a different note, issue #22 of DC Comics' \"Superman/Batman\" series, which explores alternate realities, had Bizarro transported to an alternate version of Gotham City that was patrolled by a Batman using the \"Batman Beyond\" version of the costume. A version of the future of \"Batman Beyond\" made an appearance in \"Countdown to Final Crisis\" #21, as part of the new Multiverse in the wake of the \"Infinite Crisis\" and \"52\" series, and a \"Batman Beyond\" series had been planned. In January 2015, DC published \"The Multiversity Guidebook\" which revealed a universe inspired by the DCAU is Earth-12 in the DC Multiverse, and currently in the \"Batman Beyond\" era, while the Justice Lords Earth from those Batman Beyond comics has also been added to the canon as Earth-50.\n\nWith the conclusion of the \"Justice League Unlimited\" animated series, Warner Bros has moved on to adapting new versions of the various DC comics properties rather than reviving the DCAU counterparts.\n\nThe last script written for DCAU continuity was titled \"Justice League: Worlds Collide\". This screenplay was created to bridge the several month gap between \"Justice League\" and \"Justice League Unlimited\".

The success of this miniseries inspired a similar crossover story, with Batman's DCAU incarnation meeting the \"Amazing Adventures\" comic version of the 2012 CGI series' Turtles. The concept was first announced in late July 2016, and scheduled for a six-issue release starting November 9, 2016.\n\n\n"}

Like most S-100 machines of the era, it was built around the Zilog Z80A microprocessor, and typically ran the CP/M operating system. It was produced by North Star Computers, and it could be purchased either in kit form or pre-assembled. The North Star Horizon was one of the first computers to have built in floppy drives as well as being one of the first computers to have a hard disk drive.\n\nThe computer consists of a thick aluminium chassis separated into left and right compartments with a plywood cover which sat on the top and draped over the left and right sides. (It is one of only a handful of computers to be sold in a wooden cabinet. Later versions featured an all-metal case which met safety standards.) The rear section of the compartment on the right held a linear power supply, including a large transformer and power capacitors, comprising much of the bulk and weight of the system. The empty section in front of the power supply normally housed one or two floppy disk drives, placed on their side so the slots were vertical. The compartment on the left held the S-100 motherboard, rotated so the slots ran left-right. Although a few logic circuits were on the motherboard, primarily for I/O functions, both the processor and the memory resided in separate daughterboards.\n\nCapable of running CP/M and NSDOS (North Star's proprietary Disk Operating System), a standard North Star system sported one or two hard-sectored 5.25 inch floppy disk drives and a serial interface to which one could connect a terminal to interact with it. NSDOS included North Star BASIC, a slightly non-standard dialect of BASIC, where some standard BASIC commands of the day had been changed, probably to avoid potential legal issues. Two examples of this were the EXAM and FILL commands, which took the place of the more common PEEK and POKE.\n\nThe Horizon was superseded by the all-in-one North Star Advantage in 1982. The Horizon found a niche in University environments where its inbuilt S-100 bus could be used to interface it to a variety of control systems.\n\nNorth Star released a Hard disk version, with an internal full height 5MB MFM drive. They also released a S100 card with integrated memory and two serial ports which allowed up to eight users on one Horizon, each with their own CPU sharing the disk and other resources. This operated under TurboDOS, a multi user CP/M variant with some unix like features\n\n"}

It was renamed the \"Longmoor Military Railway\" in 1935. The Liss extension was opened in 1933. The stations and junctions included:\n\nAn additional loop ran eastwards from Longmoor camp via a station at Hopkins Bridge to Whitehill Junction, completed in 1942. This provided circular running to the line, allowing for improved training without the need to turn trains at the terminals.\n\nAs a training railway, it was often being constructed/deconstructed. The layout would often change, and at one time housed a machine which could lay of track a day. At its peak, the railway ran to over of operational laid track and sidings.\n\nThe vehicles and stock on the LMR were very much an assortment to give the maximum learning opportunity. Well over a thousand locomotives had associations with the railway, although many only through the need for storage. The same was true of the signalling at the various locations on the line, including an Army version of flag signalling. After the end of World War II, the collection also included captured enemy equipment, including a \"\"Schienenwolf\"\" or railroad plough: a German wagon which dragged behind it a huge hook, used to destroy sleepers and so render railway lines unusable to advancing enemy troops.\n\nIn addition to the various military items, there were old versions of standard passenger carriages. A passenger service was operated over the line at various times, nominally for personnel required on the railway, and others from the War Department/Ministry of Defence and their families.\n\nThere was only one fatal accident recorded on the line, which occurred in October 1956.\n\nWith a declining military role for railways both in Britain and the rest of the world, it was inevitable that the significance of the facilities offered by the LMR would be reduced in later years. Even so, the LMR was still important enough for the tracks of the Bentley to Bordon branch to be left in place when passenger services were withdrawn on 16 September 1957. This line remained in place as, although there was a British Railways connection at Liss, the Bordon branch made it easier to accommodate the movements of military traffic at short notice. In 1966, the movement of goods over the Bordon branch was suspended, and the line was taken up in 1967.\n\nAmong those who learned the workings of railways on the LMR, there were a select band who continued in railway-related work after leaving the services. These were the members of the Railway Inspectorate, whose remit is to enquire into the circumstances surrounding British railway accidents. The first Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways not to have been trained in the army was R. J. Seymour, appointed in 1988.\n\nThe following standard gauge locomotives were in use in 1914:\n\nThe following standard gauge locomotives were present in 1947:\n\nThe following standard gauge locomotives were present in August 1963:\n\nA notable locomotive based on the LMR was 'Kingsley', an 1886-built 4-4-0 tank locomotive. This had formerly been locomotive No.10 of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway and was the last surviving locomotive from this company when scrapped in 1953.\n\nOn 13 October 1956 a passenger train hauled by Class 8F 2-8-0 WD512 was involved in a head-on collision with a permanent way train hauled by 0-6-0 diesel shunter WD877 \"Bari\" between Weaversdown Halt and Liss Forest Road stations. Six soldiers who were in a brake van behind the diesel locomotive were killed and eight were injured. The cause of the accident was driver error on the part of the driver of the passenger train, who had entered the section without authority. This was compounded by the signalling arrangements at Liss Forest Road, where there was no trap point to prevent the train entering the section after passing a danger signal.\n\nThe signalling system at Liss Forest was single line telephone and ticket. The block man wrote out the ticket even though the work train was still in section. The ticket was exchanged for the one engine in steam key which controlled the section from Liss Forest to Liss. This saved the block man the trip of walking up the platform with the ticket after the work train had cleared. It was a misty day and the passenger train armed with the ticket passed the signal at red which then led to the fatal crash.\n\nIn the light of the reducing role of the military and the severely reduced British Empire, it was decided by the Ministry of Defence to close the railway. On hearing of its impending closure, local locomotive preservation groups became interested in acquiring the small but complete rail system, and a bid was placed to purchase LMR along with the airstrip at Gypsy Hollow which would have enabled the production of a unique transport museum. The MOD rejected this proposal, which had been backed by the Association of Railway Preservation Societies and The Transport Trust. However, the Army did offer the last 1½ miles of line from Liss Forest Road to Liss. The offer was accepted, a provisional lease was drawn up and planning permission was sought for developments at Liss.\n\nUnfortunately, the people of Liss did not share this enthusiasm and opposed the planning permission. Several residents raised £9,100 in a successful bid to buy this last piece of line. Longmoor Military Railway closed down with a ceremonial last day of operation on 31 October 1969, though for another two years some locomotives and stock remained on site, and there were occasional movements. Three items of rolling stock (a van, a brake van, and a bogie flat) still remain on the Longmoor site, as part of the FIBUA training village.\n\nSome of the stock of the LMR did pass into the hands of preservationists, for example Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST No.118 \"Brussels\" to the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, and many relics went to the Museum of Army Transport at Beverley, Yorkshire, itself since closed, with the exhibits transferred to care of the National Army Museum, although mostly held in storage. WD Austerity 2-10-0 locomotive LMR 600 Gordon, resident on the Severn Valley Railway for many years, was donated to the SVR by the National Army Museum in 2008.\n\nSome of the Hunslet Austerity tanks were only ever at Longmoor for storage, and were not used operationally there.\n\nThe railway was used as the location for a number of films, including \"The Lady Vanishes\" (1938), \"Bhowani Junction\" (1956), \"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness\" (1958), \"Runaway Railway\" (1965), \"The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery\" (1966), \"The Magnificent Two\" (1967) and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (1968).\n\nIn February 1956, the railway was used to stage a train derailment for the BBC programme \"Saturday Night Out\", when ex-SR King Arthur class locomotive 30740 \"Merlin\" and three coaches were pushed down an incline onto a specially canted section of track.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2065830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065830", "title": "Inverse photoemission spectroscopy", "text": "Inverse photoemission spectroscopy\n\nInverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES) is a surface science technique used to study the unoccupied electronic structure of surfaces, thin films, and adsorbates. A well-collimated beam of electrons of a well defined energy (< 20 eV) is directed at the sample. These electrons couple to high-lying unoccupied electronic states and decay to low-lying unoccupied states, with a subset of these transitions being radiative. The photons emitted in the decay process are detected and an energy spectrum, photon counts vs. incident electron energy, is generated. Due to the low energy of the incident electrons, their penetration depth is only a few atomic layers, making inverse photoemission a particularly surface sensitive technique. As inverse photoemission probes the electronic states above the Fermi level of the system, it is a complementary technique to photoemission spectroscopy.\n\nThe energy of photons (formula_1, which includes Planck's constant) emitted when electrons incident on a substance using an electron beam with a constant energy (formula_2) relax to a lower energy unoccupied state (formula_3) is given by the conservation of energy as:\n\nBy measuring formula_2 and formula_1, the unoccupied state (formula_3) of the surface can be found.\n\nTwo modes can be used for this measurement. One is the isochromat mode, which scans the incident electron energy and keeps the detected photon energy constant. The other is the tunable photon energy mode, or spectrograph mode, which keeps the incident electron energy constant and measures the distribution of the detected photon energy. The latter can also measure the resonant inverse photoemission spectroscopy.\n\nIn isochromat mode, the incident electron energy is ramped and the emitted photons are detected at a fixed energy that is determined by the photon detector. Typically, an I gas filled Geiger-Müller tube with an entrance window of either SrF or CaF is used as the photon detector. The combination of window and filling gas determines the detected photon energy, and for I gas and either a SrF or CaF window, the photons energies are ~ 9.5 eV and ~ 9.7 eV, respectively.\n\nIn spectrograph mode, the energy of the incident electron remains fixed and a grating spectrometer is used to the detect the emitted photons over a range of photon energies. A diffraction grating is used to disperse the emitted photons that are in turn detected with a two-dimensional position sensitive detector.\n\nOne advantage of spectrograph mode is the ability to acquire IPES spectra over a wide range of photon energies simultaneously. Additionally, the incident electron energy remains fixed which allows better focusing of the electron beam on the sample. Furthermore, by changing the incident electron energy the electronic structure can be studied in great detail. Although the grating spectrometer is very stable over time, the set-up can be very complex and its maintenance can be very expensive. The advantages of isochromat mode are its low cost, simple design and higher count rates.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2065834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065834", "title": "Cootes Paradise", "text": "Cootes Paradise\n\nCootes Paradise Marsh is a wetland at the western end of Lake Ontario, on the west side of Hamilton Harbour. It is located in the city of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It is owned and managed by Royal Botanical Gardens (RBG), a charitable organization established in 1941 by the Government of Ontario. The marsh is part of the Cootes Paradise Nature Reserve, with these lands representing 99% of the unaltered lands along the local Lake Ontario shoreline. The site is a National Historic Site, a Nationally Important Bird Area (IBA), and an Important Amphibian and Reptile Area (IMPARA). Cootes Paradise is sometimes also called the Dundas Marsh.\n\nThe marsh was named for Thomas Coote, a British Army officer stationed in the Niagara area during the American Revolutionary War. The association of the marsh with Thomas Coote as a place he would visit to hunt and fish was recorded in the diary of Elizabeth Simcoe, wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada in 1796.\nOriginally a seasonally flooded river mouth marsh feed by Spencer Creek, it provided habitat to a wide variety of lifeforms. The habitat went into decline beginning in the late 19th century as a result of water pollution, human overuse, and the introduction of carp into Lake Ontario. A developer settled with the city of Hamilton for owed taxes and the Cootes Paradise wetlands became public property in 1927. It was placed under the control of the Royal Botanical Gardens for management.\n\nBy 1985, 85% of its plant cover was lost, 90% of the remainder was non-native species, and the carp population numbered over 70,000 fish. As part of ongoing efforts to reverse this ecological decline, RBG introduced Project Paradise in 1993, part of the Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan. The plan focuses on removing sources of stress to the marsh by focusing attention on inflowing water pollution, minimizing the number of spawning carp, and re-establishing native plants. There are a number of identified anthropogenic stresses that have led to the unbalanced populations of carp and Canada geese. These are water quality and quantity based. Poor water clarity is a result of extremely high nutrient and sediment levels derived from sewage and urban runoff. Rapid sediment accumulation is the result of unmanaged land use patterns in the watersheds, while the regulated water level in Lake Ontario has dramatically altered the flooding pattern. Project Paradise is one of the largest wetland rehabilitation projects in North America.\n\nControlled burns have also been conducted in an effort to restore some of the old field areas to their original Oak savanna ecosystem, a rare grouping of Carolinian plants and animals. Cootes Paradise Marsh is connected to Hamilton Harbour via the Desjardins Canal, which was dug through the wetland between 1826 and 1837 to connect Dundas, Ontario with shipping on the Great Lakes. It was later straightened by an excavation through the Burlington Heights in 1851.\n\nIn 2000, the City of Hamilton constructed a 3 km recreational trail connecting Royal Botanical Gardens to Pier 4 Park; this trail is also part of the Waterfront Trail system. Royal Botanical Gardens' trails are open to passive recreation only as the area is a National Historic site, Nationally Important Bird Area (IBA), Important Amphibian and Reptile Area (IMPARA), containing numerous endangered species. As such, activities such as biking, jogging and orienteering are against the by-laws other than on the Desjardins Trail.\n\nCootes Paradise is designated a nationally Important Bird Area (IBA) due to its strategic location at the tip of Lake Ontario and with the Central and Mississippi Flyways. As a result, hundreds of species of birds use Cootes Paradise at some point during the year, most notably during the spring and autumn migratory periods. Notable species include the least bittern, hooded warbler, white pelican, Caspian tern, black-crowned night-heron, osprey, pileated woodpecker, and the prothonotary warbler. Recently, a nesting pair of bald eagles have recolonized the marsh on the north shore of Cootes Paradise. This is the first such nest on Lake Ontario in more than 40 years.\n\nThe wetlands function as a seasonal fish nursery for Lake Ontario, and despite the historical degradation, most historical species of fish can still be found using the marsh in increasing numbers. As with birds and plants the location is a biodiversity hotspot for Canada with over 60 species present. Each spring thousands of spawning fish migrate in through the fishway from the harbor and lake, laying eggs and leaving shortly after, allowing the marsh to function as a giant fish hatchery. Annually between 5 and 20 million fish are produced for the lake depending on water levels and water pollution events. The species present reflect the degraded marsh habitat with the most common the gizzard shad (formerly carp). Also common are night time predators species channel catfish and brown bullhead, along with invasive species such as alewife and white perch. Popular angling species present in limited numbers include pike, largemouth bass, and yellow perch, but the large adults are only present in the marsh during the spawning season which is closed to fishing. The spring and fall season also brings several migrating salmon and trout to the marshes main inflowing river.\n\nIn 2007, when there was low water level in Lake Ontario and a favorable wind, all the water was pushed out of Cootes Paradise and the remaining carp swam out into Hamilton Harbour. RBG staff removed the fish gates and herded out the last of the carp, and then replaced the gates. Since then the wetland has been relatively carp free. In the absence of these large destructive bottom feeders there is a gradual return natural native plant species populations.\n\nLarge populations of turtles inhabit Cootes Paradise, including Painted Turtles, Common Snapping Turtles, and Northern Map Turtles. Several species of snakes are also found in the area, including Northern Water Snakes.\n\nOver 30 mammal species inhabit Cootes Paradise, including white-tailed deer, red fox, raccoon, beaver, cottontail rabbit, muskrat, mink, opossum, red squirrel, coyote, southern flying squirrel, northern flying squirrel, star-nosed mole, and peculiar species such as the water vole.\n\nCootes Paradise is home to the highest concentration of plant species in Canada at over 750 native species; however, an additional 300 have also been introduced following European settlement of the area, putting strain on the local ecosystem's ability to function. Among the trees found in Cootes Paradise are various species of oak, maple, and pine, as well as less common species such as sassafras tree, Kentucky coffee tree, and tulip tree. Examples can be found along the native trees walk across from the nature centre. In recent years there has been a noticeable loss of trees due to ongoing anthropogenic stresses on the RBG property surrounding Cootes Paradise, and in 2005, following the death of a child participating on a nature hike, the RBG was forced to cut down numerous dead and dying trees that posed a public-safety concern, and alter the trail system to ensure some of the sensitive habitat could remain undisturbed by these activities.\n\nA recent analysis of the checklist of all plants growing within the various nature sanctuaries of RBG reveals that these properties are among the richest spots in Canada for plant diversity, with 24% of the flora of Canada and 38% of the flora of Ontario present. Among this diversity are multiple nationally and provincially endangered species.\n\nWest of Bull's Point is an island called Hickory Island. The island was dominated by Hickory tree, but was killed by Double-crested cormorant, due to their feces being very toxic. The RBG tried to scare away them a few times with Fireworks, but they still remain on the island.\n\nSouthern wild rice, Zizania Aquatica, has been successfully reintroduced by the Royal Botanical Gardens\n\n"}

The island is about long, wide and in size.\n\nThe main northbound shipping channel of the Detroit River currently lies between Bois Blanc Island and the Amherstburg mainland. A stone lighthouse was built in 1836 on the southern tip of Boblo Island which marks the historical beginning of the Detroit River navigation channel for ships traveling upriver from Lake Erie in more modern times. It is now part of the Bois Blanc Island Lighthouse and Blockhouse.\n\nBois Blanc means \"White Woods,\" a name derived from the many birch and beech trees in the area. \"Boblo\" is an English corruption of the French pronunciation of the name. Several islands with the same name dot the Great Lakes, and nearly all are known as \"Boblo\" or \"Bob-lo\" by the local populations.\n\nThe island had strategic importance when Fort Amherstburg (now Fort Malden) was built in 1796 to guard passage along the Detroit River after Detroit, Michigan was turned over to the Americans. Guns from the fort could reach the island across the navigable waters and hence secured the river.\n\nBoblo Island has a very rich history. Its association with the ancient Sauk Trail, the earliest European reference made about the island in 1718, which describes 70 First Nation families peacefully farming the fertile land, later it became the place where French Catholic had a mission for the Wyandot (Wendat) First Nation (also known as \"the Huron Indians\") in the 18th century, the location of the site of the headquarters for the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh (\"Shooting Star\") the leader of a large tribal confederacy (known as Tecumseh's Confederacy), during the War of 1812, and it was the location of the invasion point for 60 Canadian \"Patriots\" on January 8, 1838 during the Upper Canada Rebellion and also served as the stepping stone for numerous individuals on the Underground Railroad to Canada. One estimate puts 30,000 people as having had crossed over between 1834 and 1860.\n\nBois Blanc is known regionally as the former home of the Boblo Island Amusement Park, which began operation in 1898 and closed on September 30, 1993. The Nightmare (ride), Falling Star, Wild Mouse, Sky Streak and Screamer were the signature rides. \n\nFor more than 85 years, the park was serviced by SS \"Ste. Clair\" and .\n\nThe Boblo Island Amusement Park was famous for those two steamers, which went between Detroit and the island. A lawsuit concerning the power of the state of Michigan to prohibit racial discrimination on the ferries, \"Bob-Lo Excursion Co. v. Michigan\", 333 U.S. 28 (1948), reached the U.S. Supreme Court and resulted in a notable decision construing the Commerce Clause.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, when Canada had become a safe haven for those who refused to be drafted into the U.S. Army, Boblo Island became an efficient transit point for Americans who sought refuge from prosecution. Those seeking to pass into Canada would take the boat from Detroit to Boblo and, upon arrival, would trade their return tickets with persons who had arrived on the island from Amherstburg. Those who had come from Canada took the return trip to Detroit, and those who had come from Detroit took the return trip to Amherstburg, thus arriving in Canada without having to pass through customs at the border.\n\nThe island is currently being developed as Boblo Island and Marina Resort Community by Amico Properties Limited.

It is a benzylidene camphor derivative, many of which are known for their excellent photostability.\n\nAlthough there are a few different UV absorbers with the trade name Mexoryl, only two of them are widely used where approved. Mexoryl SX (water-soluble) and Mexoryl XL (INCI Drometrizole trisiloxane, oil-soluble). Together they show a synergistic effect in protection. The patents are held by L'Oréal. Sunscreens containing ecamsule are exclusive to L'Oréal and its brands.\n\nExposed to UV, ecamsule undergoes reversible photoisomerization, followed by photoexcitation. The absorbed UV is then released as thermal energy, without penetrating the skin.\n\nUVB rays cause short-term sunburn and skin cancer; UVA rays cause wrinkling and may have some role in development of skin cancer. There is no official rating for UVA protection in the US. In Europe, there are several different rating systems that are used to measure effectiveness in blocking UVA rays, including the IPD (immediate pigment darkening assay) and the PPD (persistent pigment darkening assay). The UVB range is 280 to 320 nanometers, and the UVA range is 320 to 400. Ecamsule protects against UV wavelengths in the 290–400 nanometer range, with peak protection at 345 nm. Since ecamsule doesn't cover the entire UV spectrum, it should be combined with other active sunscreen agents to ensure broad-spectrum UV protection. Ecamsule is a photostable organic UVA absorber, meaning it doesn't degrade significantly when exposed to light. This is in contrast to the widely used UVA absorber avobenzone that is not intrinsically photostable and requires photostabilizers to prevent significant degradation in light.\n\nA 5% ecamsule containing sunscreen can prevent early changes leading to photoaging in humans. A broad spectrum sunscreen with ecamsule, avobenzone and octocrylene significantly reduces the skin damage associated with UV exposure in human subjects.\n\nIn studies done in mice it reduces the formation of UV induced pyrimidine dimers and delays the onset of skin cancer. In vitro ecamsule effectively protects against the harmful effects of UV.\n\nEcamsule has little percutaneous absorption and little systemic effects, therefore it is considered relatively safe. \nA mouse study shows that it does not increase the probability of promoting skin cancer. Studies done in vitro show that it is not photomutagenic.\n\nBecause ecamsule is an acid it needs to be neutralized in order to be used without offsetting the final pH of the sunscreen too much. Usually this is done with triethanolamine.\n\nL'Oréal patented ecamsule first in 1982. It was approved in the EU in 1991. Sunscreens based on ecamsule have been available in Europe, Canada and other parts of the world since 1993. Ecamsule was given approval by the FDA in 2006 to be used in the U.S. However this approval only extends to ecamsule containing sunscreens registered under a New Drug Application, not ecamsule itself.\n\n"}

Prior to that, he served as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Israel (1978–95), as the Attorney General of Israel (1975–78), and as the Dean of the Law Faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1974–75).\n\nAharon Barak was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, the only son of Zvi Brick, an attorney, and his wife Leah, a teacher. After the Nazi occupation of the city in 1941, the family spent three years in the Kovno ghetto. At the end of the war, after wandering through Hungary, Austria, and Italy, Barak and his parents reached Rome, where they spent the next two years. In 1947, they received travel papers and immigrated to Palestine. After a brief period on a \"moshav\", the family settled in Jerusalem.\n\nHe studied law, international relations and economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and obtained his Bachelor of Laws in 1958. Between 1958 and 1960, having been drafted into the Israeli Defense Forces, he served in the office of the Financial Advisor to the Chief of Staff. Upon discharging his service he returned to the Hebrew University, where he completed his doctoral dissertation with distinction in 1963. Simultaneously he began work as an intern at the Attorney General's office. When the Attorney General began dealing with the trial of Adolf Eichmann, Barak, being a Holocaust survivor, preferred not to be involved in the work. He was transferred to the State Attorney's office to complete his internship at his request. Upon completing his internship he was recognised as a certified attorney.\n\nBarak is married to Elisheva Barak-Ussoskin, former vice president of the National Labor Court, with whom he has three daughters and a son, all trained in the law.\n\nBetween 1966 and 1967 Barak studied at Harvard University. In 1968 he was appointed as a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and in 1974 was named the Dean of its Law Faculty. In 1975, at age 38, he was awarded the Israel Prize for legal research. In the same year he became a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. In 1978 he became a foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1978, Barak served as the Attorney General of Israel. Among his well-known decisions in this capacity were:\n\nBarak was appointed by Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1978 as the legal advisor to the Israeli delegation for negotiating the Camp David Accords. In his book \"\", Jimmy Carter praises Barak as a negotiator despite the political disagreements between them.\n\nOn 22 September 1978, Barak began his service as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Israel – the youngest of all of the judges.\n\nIn 1982–83 he served as a member of the Kahan Commission, a state investigation committee formed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Sabra and Shatila massacre. As part of the committee's conclusions, then Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon was removed from his position. The committee further recommended that he never be appointed to that position again in the future. In 1993, with the retirement of the Deputy President of the Supreme Court Menachem Elon, Barak was appointed the Deputy President. Subsequently, with the retirement of the President Meir Shamgar on 13 August 1995, Barak was appointed the President of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the course of his service on the Supreme Court Barak greatly expanded the range of issues with which the court dealt. He canceled the standing test which Israel's Supreme Court had used frequently, and greatly expanded the scope of justiciability by allowing petitions on a range of matters. Professor Daphna Barak-Erez commented that:\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of Judge Barak on Israeli law is found in the change which he led with regard to all matters of justiciability. Judge Barak was the instigator and leader of the outlook which regards the traditional doctrine of justiciability as inappropriately and unnecessarily limiting the matters which the court deals with. Under the leadership of Judge Barak, the Supreme Court significantly increased the [range of] fields in which it is [willing to intervene].\n\nSimultaneously, he advanced a number of standards, both for public administration (mainly, the standard of the reasonableness of the administrative decision) and in the private sector (the standard of good faith), while blurring the distinction between the two. Barak's critics have argued that, in doing so, the Supreme Court under his leadership harmed judicial consistency and stability, particularly in the private sector.\n\nSince 1992, much of his judicial work was focused on advancing and shaping Israel's Constitutional Revolution (a phrase which he coined), which he believed was brought about by the adoption of Basic Laws in the Israeli Knesset dealing with human rights. According to Barak's approach, which was adopted by the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Revolution brought values such as the Right to Equality, Freedom of Employment and Freedom of Speech to a position of normative supremacy, and thereby granted the courts (not just the Supreme Court) the ability to strike down legislation which is inconsistent with the rights embodied in the Basic Laws. Consequently, Barak held that the State of Israel has been transformed from a parliamentary democracy to a constitutional parliamentary democracy, in that its Basic Laws were to be interpreted as its constitution.\n\nDuring his time as President of the Supreme Court, Barak advanced a judicial activist approach, whereby the court was not required to limit itself to judicial interpretation, but rather was permitted to fill the gaps in the law through judicial legislation at common law. This approach was highly controversial and was met with much opposition, including by some politicians. The Israeli legal commentator Ze'ev Segal wrote in a 2004 article, \"Barak sees the Supreme Court as a [force for societal change], far beyond the primary role as a decisor in disputes. The Supreme Court under his leadership is fulfilling a central role in the shaping of Israeli law, not much less than [the role of] the Knesset. Barak is the leading power in the court, as a key judge in it for a quarter of a century, and as the number 1 judge for some 10 years now.\"\n\nOn 14 September 2006, upon reaching the mandatory age, Barak retired from the Supreme Court. Three months later he published his final judgments, among them a number of precedents regarding damages in tort for residents of the Palestinian territories, Israel's policy of targeted killing, and preferential treatment for IDF veterans.\n\nParallel to his service in the Supreme Court, Barak also served as the head of a committee which, for some twenty years, drafted the Israeli Civil Codex, which worked to unite the 24 main civil law statutes in Israeli law under a single comprehensive law.\n\nAfter his retirement from the Supreme Court, Barak joined the staff of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, and he teaches in the master's degree program for Commercial Law. He also lectures in the Bachelor of Laws program. In addition, he continues to lecture at both the Yale Law School and the University of Alabama in the United States, as well as lecturing as a Distinguished Visitor at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law.\n\n\nBarak's decisions as President of the Supreme Court impacted many aspects of life in Israel, and were the subject of both praise and criticism. Barak championed a proactive judiciary that has interpreted Israel's Basic Law as its constitution, and challenged Israeli parliament (Knesset) laws on that basis. Two of his books on legal commentary have been translated to English.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the Supreme Court, the new President of the Court, Judge Dorit Beinisch, said at his farewell ceremony:\n\nAt the heart of the development of the law of Israel stands Aharon Barak. He opened new horizons. The law as it stands after his [Presidency] differs in its purpose from the era which preceded him. Since his first year in the Supreme Court his rulings were groundbreaking, since '78 and until today he set the central legal norms that this court granted Israeli society.\n\nOn the issue of the substantial expansion of the right of standing and the test of reasonableness of an administrative decision (which grants the courts the power to overrule an administrative decision if the judge is convinced that it does not \"stand [within the] bounds of reasonableness\"), Amnon Rubinstein wrote:\n\nThus a situation has arisen whereby the Supreme Court may convene and decide on every conceivable issue. In addition to that the unreasonableness of an administrative decision will be grounds for judicial intervention. This was a total revolution in the judicial thinking which characterized the Supreme Court of previous generations, and this has given it the reputation of the most activist court in the world, causing both admiration and criticism. In practice, in many respects the Supreme Court under Barak has become an alternate government.\n\nAmong critics of Barak's judicial activism are former President of the Supreme Court of Israel Moshe Landau, Ruth Gavison, and Richard Posner. Posner, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and authority on jurisprudence, criticised Barak's decision to interpret the Basic Laws as Israel's constitution, stating that \"only in Israel ... do judges confer the power of abstract review on themselves, without benefit of a constitutional or legislative provision.\" He also argues that Barak's idea of the courts enforcing a set of rights which they find in \"substantive\" democracy, rather than merely democratic political rights, actually involves a curtailing of democracy and results in a \"hyperactive judiciary.\" Furthermore, he claims that Barak's approach to the interpretation of statutes involves, in practice, interpretation in the context of the judge's own personal ideal system, and \"opens up a vast realm for discretionary judgment\", rather than providing for an objective interpretation of the statute. He is also critical of Barak's view of the separation of powers, arguing that, in effect, it is that \"judicial power is unlimited and the legislature cannot remove judges.\" He also asserts that Barak fails to apply his own judicial philosophy in practice at times. Nevertheless, Posner said that \"Barak himself is by all accounts brilliant, as well as austere and high-minded – Israel's Cato\", and that while he would not regard Barak's judicial approach as a desirable universal model, it may be suited to Israel's specific circumstances. He also suggested that if there were a Nobel prize for law, Barak would likely be among its early recipients.\n\nBeyond the legal community, on both the left and right of the political spectrum, there are those who were highly critical of Barak. His judgments on matters of security, in particular, have been subject to criticism by some on both the left and the right.\n\nBarak is a secular Jew but believes in compromise with the religious sector, and state support for religion. His judgments on the interaction between religion and state have led to hostility towards him by some in the religious public. Religious Jews from all sectors of society (including both Haredim and Religious Zionists) held a mass protest against the Supreme Court under his Presidency, after the Supreme Court ruled that in cases of divorce the Israeli religious courts of law are required to decide property disputes according to the law of the Knesset rather than according to the Halakha.\n\n\nBarak's legal philosophy starts with the belief that \"the world is filled with law\". This idea portrays law as an all-encompassing framework of human affairs from which no action can ever be immune: Whatever the law does not prohibit, it permits; either way, the law always has its say, on everything.\n\n\nBarak's son-in-law Ram Landes made a one-hour documentary film about Barak in 2009 called \"The Judge\" (), based on an in-depth interview with Barak.\n\n\n\n"}

He batted and threw right-handed and was listed as tall and .\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh and of Lithuanian descent, as a teenager he attended a seminary in Niagara Falls, Ontario, and studied for the Roman Catholic priesthood for 4 years before entering pro baseball. \n\nThomas signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent in 1947. He debuted with the Pirates in 1951. With the Pirates, he made three All-Star Games, and finished fourth in the voting for Most Valuable Player in 1958, when he batted .281, finished second in the National League to Ernie Banks with 35 home runs, and had 109 RBIs.

The island covers about and is about 12 miles (19 km) long, 6 miles (9.6 km) wide and has 6 lakes. It lies southeast of Mackinac Island and almost due north of the city of Cheboygan.\n\n\"Bois Blanc\" is French for \"white wood\". The name is commonly thought to be a reference to either: (a) the paper birch, or more likely (b) the basswood, called \"bois blanc\" in other contexts. The basswood's white underbark was extensively used by Native Americans and French-speaking fur traders for cordage, including the sewing up of canoes and the manufacture of webbing for snowshoes. The French Canadian colloquial term for \"inner bark\" was bois blanc. The Native Americans themselves had a name for Bois Blanc Island and the meaning is the same as the Canadian name. It was called Wigobiminiss. Wigobi or wicopy signifies \"tying bark\" or \"inner bark\". Miniss means \"island\".\n\n\"Boblo\" is an English corruption of the French pronunciation of the name. Several islands with the same name dot the Great Lakes, and nearly all are known as \"Boblo\" or \"Bob-lo\" by the local populations.\n\nBois Blanc was ceded by the local Anishinaabe (Chippewa) as \"an extra and voluntary gift\" to the U.S. federal government with the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. The cession for the area, Article 3, item 13 of the treaty states: \"The post of Michilimackinac, and all the land on the island on which that post stands, and the main land adjacent, of which the Indian title has been extinguished by gifts or grants to the French or English governments; and a piece of land on the main to the north of the island, to measure six miles, on lake Huron, or the strait between lakes Huron and Michigan, and to extend three miles back from the water of the lake or strait; and also, the Island De Bois Blane, being an extra and voluntary gift of the Chippewa nation.\" The treaty ceded most of Ohio and a slice of Indiana to the government, as well as sixteen strategic sites well within Indian territory, on waterways in the future states of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, U.S. Navy Captain Arthur Sinclair's fleet took shelter at the island while waiting to attack the British at Fort Mackinac. In 1880 the island provided a haven to alleged murderer Henry English who escaped from Pennsylvania authorities before his trial. He was apprehended on Bois Blanc by Pinkerton agents, returned to Pennsylvania and acquitted.\n\nIn 1827, the United States mapped the island. The United States Life Saving Service established a life-saving station at Walker's Point in 1890. A few years earlier the Pointe Aux Pins Association was formed. After extensive use as a source of kilned lime and firewood for Mackinac Island and other local frontier settlements, Bois Blanc was settled in the late 19th century as a summer resort community. In 1908, on behalf of the association, President Walter B. Webb hired the Mason L. Brown Company, a Detroit surveying firm, to map and record the Pointe Aux Pins subdivision. Pointe Aux Pins was the first resort community on the island. Much of Bois Blanc Island is state-owned forest land containing White and Norway pines that tower tall. As recently as the 1950s, Bois Blanc provided lumber to Mackinac Island where woodcutting is prohibited.\n\nBois Blanc Island was without electric service until 1964, when the Presque Isle Electric & Gas Co-Op completed a project to install a continuous 3.7-mile underwater cable from Point Nipigon to Bois Blanc. At that time, there were approximately 200 structures on the island. An electric service upgrade in 1999 replaced the original cable with two submarine cables spanning the Straits of Mackinac.\n\nPrivate and commercial motor vehicles are brought to and from Bois Blanc Island by ferry. There are no paved roads; however, a maintained county road extends from the island's northeast corner to the far western tip. Fire Tower Road bisects the island and is also the route used for public access to Twin Lakes and Lake Thompson, Bois Blanc's largest inland lakes. There are numerous un-maintained roads and trails.\n\nPlaunt Transportation is the sole provider of ferry services for the island. Ferries are sailed daily when the straits are not frozen over from Cheboygan to Pointe Aux Pins. \"Kristen D\" is a ferry which operates between Cheboygan and Bois Blanc Island. The ferry can accommodate up to 16 vehicles.\n\nThe island is served by Bois Blanc Island Airport, a paved landing strip located on the island (Airport Code 6Y1, elev. 664').\n\nDuring some winters, an ice road is marked by cut evergreen trees, allowing travel over the ice between the island and the mainland. The route generally runs from Pries Landing on the mainland, to Sand Bay on Bois Blanc.\n\nBois Blanc Island has been the setting for several fictional novels, and is also the subject of two full-length music albums, \"This Ain't the Mainland\" (2010) and \"Bob-Lo Style\" (2013), both by Northern Michigan singer/songwriter Dan Reynolds.\n\n"}

McDonald\n\nJames Edward McDonald (May 7, 1920 – June 13, 1971) was an American physicist. He is best known for his research regarding UFOs. McDonald was senior physicist at the Institute for Atmospheric Physics and professor in the Department of Meteorology, University of Arizona, Tucson.\n\nMcDonald campaigned in support of expanding UFO studies during the mid and late 1960s, arguing that UFOs represented an important unsolved mystery which had not been adequately studied by science. He was one of the more prominent figures of his time who argued in favor of the extraterrestrial hypothesis as a plausible, but not completely proved, model of UFO phenomena.\n\nMcDonald interviewed over 500 UFO witnesses, uncovered many important government UFO documents, and gave presentations of UFO evidence. He testified before Congress during the UFO hearings of 1968. McDonald also gave a famous talk called \"Science in Default\" to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). It was a summary of the current UFO evidence and a critique of the 1969 Condon Report UFO study.\n\nMcDonald was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota. He served as a cryptographer in the United States Navy during World War II, and afterwards, married Betsy Hunt; they had six children.\n\nMcDonald studied at the University of Omaha, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and earned his Ph.D. at Iowa State University. He taught at the University of Chicago for a year, then in 1953, he was invited to help establish a meteorology and atmospherics program at the University of Arizona as a professor of meteorology. McDonald eventually became the head of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, but resigned as its administrator after about a year because he preferred to teach and research rather than oversee the department. He taught courses from introductory to graduate levels, received good evaluations, and was fondly regarded by his students.\n\nHis specialty was cloud formation and physics, but his natural curiosity led him to read widely in many other scientific fields. McDonald was a widely recognized authority of atmospheric phenomena: he published many articles in peer reviewed journals, and contributed to several standard meteorology textbooks. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Meteorological Society.\n\nMcDonald was one of many experts who testified before congress in the 1960s against the development of supersonic transport airplanes, for fear that they would damage the ozone layer.\n\nMost of McDonald's life is known through the authorized biography \"Firestorm: Dr. James E. McDonald's Fight For UFO Science\" (2003) by Ann Druffel.\n\nIn 1954, while driving through the Arizona desert with two meteorologists, McDonald spotted an unidentified flying object none of the men could readily identify. Though a rather unspectacular sighting of a distant point of light, this sighting would spur McDonald's interest in UFOs. By the late 1950s he was quietly investigating UFO reports in Arizona, and he had also joined NICAP, then the largest and most prominent civilian UFO research group in the nation. Given his training in atmospheric physics, McDonald was able to examine UFO reports in greater detail than most other scientists, and was able to offer explanations for some previously unexplained reports. Using his security clearance with the US government, he also uncovered a number of well-documented UFO reports from the US Air Force's Project Blue Book, which he judged deeply puzzling even after stringent analysis.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, McDonald began speaking about UFOs more openly. McDonald's first detailed, public discussion of UFOs was in a lecture given before an American Meteorological Society assembly in Washington D.C. on October 5, 1966. Entitled \"The Problem of UFOs\", McDonald's speech was the first of many given to an overflow audience. McDonald declared that scientific scrutiny should be directed towards the small number of \"unknowns\", which he defined as a UFO reported by a \"credible and trained observer as machine-like 'craft' which remained unidentified in spite of careful investigation.\" He noted that the vast majority of UFOs could become Identified flying objects, and, in his estimation, only about 1% of UFOs were true \"unknowns\". McDonald also lambasted the U.S. Air Force for what he saw as their inept handling of UFO studies.\n\nIn 1967 the Office of Naval Research granted McDonald a small budget in order to conduct his own UFO research, ostensibly to study the idea that some UFOs were misidentified clouds. He was able to peruse the files of Project Blue Book at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, and eventually concluded that the Air Force was mishandling UFO evidence. Following the Robertson Panel's recommendations in 1953, the Air Force was following a debunking directive towards UFO reports, and only discussing UFO cases which were considered solved by a mundane explanation. All unexplained UFO cases were classified \"secret\" and not released to the public (see Robertson Panel for further information).\n\nMcDonald was particularly disturbed that astronomer J. Allen Hynek, had not alerted the scientific community to the fact that Project Blue Book was withholding some of the most anomalous and compelling UFO reports. Hynek argued that if he had exposed this, the Air Force would have dumped him as Blue Book's consultant; Hynek was the only scientist formally studying UFOs for the government. This was the beginning of a rift between the two men that would never be entirely reconciled.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s, McDonald devoted much of his time to trying to persuade journalists, politicians and his colleagues that UFOs were the most pressing issue facing American science. He gave dozens of lectures, and wrote volumes of letters to newspapers, to his peers (especially at scientific journals) and to politicians. McDonald wrote to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, arguing that they needed to radically shift what he saw as their superficial perspective towards UFOs. In response, the Air Force determined that they needed to \"fireproof\" themselves against McDonald's statements because of his unquestionable qualifications and credibility.\n\nHe managed to secure limited support from a few prominent figures, such as United Nations Secretary General U Thant, who arranged for McDonald to speak to the UN's Outer Space Affairs Group on June 7, 1967. Additionally in 1967, McDonald noted, \"There is no sensible alternative to the utterly shocking hypothesis that UFOs are extraterrestrial probes\".\n\nIn his Statement on Unidentified Objects to the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, McDonald made the following remarks regarding types of UFO accounts.\n\nIn the same statement, he said he had \"become convinced that the scientific community ... has been casually ignoring as nonsense a matter of extraordinary scientific importance.\"\n\nMcDonald often used guarded wording in his discussions of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, such as once describing the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the \"least unsatisfactory\" explanation for UFOs. He seemed to regard the extraterrestrial hypothesis not as unimpeachable fact, but as a working model. McDonald's acquaintance George Early, a prominent engineer with the United Aircraft Association and also a NICAP member, said, \"I don't think Jim was 100% sold on the UFOs being extraterrestrial spacecraft with beings in them ... His essential thrust was that here is a topic worthy of scientific study which has not been studied scientifically, and we should find out what the answer is. He had a definite commitment to the truth, and if the truth turned out to be something else [other than the extraterrestrial hypothesis], he wouldn't have backed away from it\".\n\nFollowing a widely publicized series of mass UFO sightings in southern Michigan in 1966, McDonald became one of several scientists to urge various authorities in the federal government and scientific community to undertake a formal study of UFOs. This public pressure, combined with pressure from some members of Congress (such as then-Congressman Gerald Ford), led the federal government to create the Condon Committee in late 1966. Based at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and named after Committee Chairman Dr. Edward Condon, a prominent physicist, the committee was advertised as an unbiased, objective, and thorough investigation into the UFO phenomenon.\n\nInitially, McDonald shared the early general enthusiasm towards the Condon Committee, and given his scientific credentials and interest in UFOs he offered to serve on the committee. When he was denied a position on the committee, McDonald still agreed to assist in other ways with the committee's work. However, McDonald and other UFO researchers soon became disillusioned with the committee, and in particular with its chairman, Dr. Condon, and his chief assistant, Dr. Robert Low. Condon's public comments to reporters ridiculing UFO eyewitnesses and his generally dismissive attitude towards the subject led many UFO researchers to doubt whether the investigation would be as neutral and unbiased as it proclaimed. McDonald formed alliances with those on the Condon Committee who disagreed with Condon's leadership and who wanted to undertake long-term UFO studies.\n\nMcDonald played a major role in the controversy regarding the Condon Committee when one of the committee's investigators - who disagreed with Condon's attitudes - privately gave him a copy of the so-called \"Trick Memo\". The memorandum, which was written by Condon's chief assistant Dr. Robert Low, outlined how the Committee could reach a predetermined conclusion that all UFO cases were explainable in mundane terms, while simultaneously appearing neutral during the actual investigation process. The \"Trick Memo\" seemed to confirm his worst fears about the Condon Committee's bias regarding the UFO phenomenon. Following McDonald's release to the public of the now-infamous \"Trick Memo\", Project Chair Edward Condon tried unsuccessfully to get McDonald fired from his tenured faculty position at the University of Arizona.\n\nWhen the Condon Committee issued its final report in 1969, Dr. Condon wrote in the foreword to the report that, based on the committee's investigations, his conclusion was that there was nothing unusual about UFO reports; thus further scientific research into the UFO phenomenon was not worthwhile and should be discouraged. Condon's conclusions about UFOs were generally accepted by most scientists and the \"mainstream\" news media. McDonald, however, became one of a small number of scientists and researchers who wrote detailed critiques and rebuttals of Condon's conclusions regarding UFOs. McDonald was particularly disturbed by the fact that, while Condon in his foreword had claimed that all UFO reports could be explained as hoaxes or misidentifications of manmade or natural objects or phenomena, the Report itself actually listed over 30% of the cases it investigated as \"unexplained\".\n\nMcDonald engaged in an often adversarial relationship with aviation journalist and skeptic Philip J. Klass, who argued in his first book that nearly all UFOs can be explained by ball lightning. At first, the duo exchanged cordial letters on the subject. Klass was rather guarded in his application of the plasma theory at the time, and McDonald agreed that it might explain a small portion of UFO reports. However, Klass quickly expanded his hypothesis arguing that most if not all UFOs, and even cases of alleged alien abduction, could be explained as plasmas. McDonald thought this was absurd, and offered a detailed rebuttal against Klass's thesis.\n\nIn late 1967, McDonald secured a modest grant from the Office of Naval Research in order to study cloud formations in Australia. While in Australia, McDonald conducted some UFO research on his own time. Klass mounted an extended, concerted campaign against McDonald, arguing that he had squandered government funds. The ONR responded by announcing that they knew of McDonald's UFO interests and had no objections to his personal hobbies. The University of Arizona came to McDonald's defense, announcing that McDonald's UFO research was done on his own time, and had no adverse impact on his regular teaching and research duties at the university.\n\nKlass then demonstrated that McDonald was spending at least small sums of government research funds on UFO research, and the ONR, apparently fearing controversy, decided to no longer fund McDonald's cloud research.\n\nMcDonald spoke before the United States Congress for a UFO hearing in 1968. In part, he stated his opinion that \"UFOs are entirely real and we do not know what they are, because we have laughed them out of court. The possibility that these are extraterrestrial devices, that we are dealing with surveillance from some advanced technology, is a possibility I take very seriously\". McDonald emphasized that he accepted the extraterrestrial hypothesis as a possibility not due to any specific evidence in its favor, but because he judged competing hypotheses as inadequate.\n\nJames McDonald did not accept the conclusions of the Condon Report because 30% of the cases studied in the report remained unexplained. The evidence provided in the final report could have substantiated the opposite conclusion (that UFOs warranted much more scientific study) rather than the official conclusion, which was to recommend no further study. \"Firestorm\", a biography of McDonald by UFO researcher Ann Druffel, gives a detailed account of McDonald's tireless efforts promoting scientific UFO research.\n\nIn 1969, McDonald was a speaker at an American Association for the Advancement of Science UFO symposium. There he delivered a lecture, \"Science in Default\", which Jerome Clark calls \"one of the most powerful scientific defenses of UFO reality ever mounted\". McDonald discussed in detail a handful of well documented UFO cases which seemed, he thought, to defy interpretation by conventional science.\n\nMcDonald's UFO efforts were exacting a toll: he was becoming professionally isolated, and his marriage was faltering. Beyond Klass and Condon, McDonald butted heads with many other prominent figures, including Donald H. Menzel of Harvard University. McDonald's personality may have been a factor in these confrontations; even his friends described him as sometimes forceful and impatient, while others, less charitably, called him blunt and abrasive. Additionally, McDonald suffered a public humiliation when in 1970, he agreed to appear before a committee of the United States Congress to provide evidence against the development of the supersonic transport (SST) plane. Like many other atmospheric physicists who testified with him, McDonald was convinced that the plane could potentially harm the Earth's vital but fragile ozone layer. During his testimony Congressman Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts — whose district contained factories that would help build the SST — tried to discredit McDonald's SST testimony by switching the hearing to a discussion of McDonald's UFO research. Although McDonald defended his UFO work and noted that his evidence regarding the SST had nothing to do with UFOs, Conte bluntly stated that anyone who \"believes in little green men\" was, in his opinion, not a credible witness. McDonald was deeply humiliated by Conte's mocking attitude, and by the open laughter of some committee members.\n\nIn March, 1971, McDonald's wife Betsy told him she wanted a divorce. McDonald seems to have started planning his suicide not long afterwards. He finished a few articles he was writing (UFO-related and otherwise), and made plans for the storage of his notes, papers, and research. In April 1971 he attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived, but was blinded and was recovering in the hospital. The next day he was nowhere to be found. However, on June 13, 1971, a family, walking along a creek close to the bridge spanning the Canada Del Oro Wash near Tucson, found a body that was later identified as McDonald's. A .38 caliber revolver was found close to him, as well as a suicide note.\n\nFour of McDonald's peers from the University of Arizona wrote a reminiscence of their colleague, calling him \"a man of great integrity and great courage. He was loved and admired by a great many people ... he made a lasting impact on many facets of atmospheric sciences ... and he will be missed much more than we now realize\".\n\n"}

In 1938, Stephen Brunauer, Paul Hugh Emmett, and Edward Teller published the first article about the BET theory in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. The BET theory applies to systems of multilayer adsorption and usually utilizes probing gases that do not chemically react with material surfaces as adsorbates to quantify specific surface area. Nitrogen is the most commonly employed gaseous adsorbate used for surface probing by BET methods. For this reason, standard BET analysis is most often conducted at the boiling temperature of N (77 K). Further probing adsorbates are also utilized, albeit with lower frequency, allowing the measurement of surface area at different temperatures and measurement scales. These have included argon, carbon dioxide, and water. Specific surface area is a scale-dependent property, with no single true value of specific surface area definable, and thus quantities of specific surface area determined through BET theory may depend on the adsorbate molecule utilized and its adsorption cross section.\n\nThe concept of the theory is an extension of the Langmuir theory, which is a theory for monolayer molecular adsorption, to multilayer adsorption with the following hypotheses:\nThe resulting BET equation is\n\nwhere formula_2 and formula_3 are the equilibrium and the saturation pressure of adsorbates at the temperature of adsorption, formula_4 is the adsorbed gas quantity (for example, in volume units), and formula_5 is the monolayer adsorbed gas quantity. formula_6 is the \"BET constant\",\n\nwhere formula_8 is the heat of adsorption for the first layer, and formula_9 is that for the second and higher layers and is equal to the heat of liquefaction or heat of vaporisation.\n\nEquation (1) is an adsorption isotherm and can be plotted as a straight line with formula_10 on the y-axis and formula_11 on the x-axis according to experimental results. This plot is called a \"BET plot\". The linear relationship of this equation is maintained only in the range of formula_12. The value of the slope formula_13 and the y-intercept formula_14 of the line are used to calculate the monolayer adsorbed gas quantity formula_5 and the BET constant formula_6. The following equations can be used:\n\nThe BET method is widely used in materials science for the calculation of surface areas of solids by physical adsorption of gas molecules. The total surface area formula_19 and the specific surface area formula_20 are given by\nwhere formula_5 is in units of volume which are also the units of the monolayer volume of the adsorbate gas,\nformula_24 is the Avogadro number, formula_25 the adsorption cross section of the adsorbing species, formula_26 the molar volume of the adsorbate gas, and formula_27 the mass of the solid sample or adsorbent.\n\nThe BET theory can be derived similarly to the Langmuir theory, but by considering multilayered gas molecule adsorption, where it is not required for a layer to be completed before an upper layer formation starts. Furthermore, the authors made five assumptions:\n\nConsider a given amount of solid sample in a controlled atmosphere. Let \"θ\" be the fractional coverage of the sample surface covered by a number \"i\" of successive molecule layers. Let us assume that the adsorption rate \"R\" for molecules on a layer (\"i\"-1) (i.e. formation of a layer \"i\") is proportional to both its fractional surface \"θ\" and to the pressure \"P\", and that the desorption rate \"R\" on a layer \"i\" is also proportional to its fractional surface \"θ\":\nwhere \"k\" and \"k\" are the kinetic constants (depending on the temperature) for the adsorption on the layer (\"i\"−1) and desorption on layer \"i\", respectively. For the adsorptions, these constant are assumed similar whatever the surface.\nAssuming an Arrhenius law for desorption, the related constants can be expressed as\nwhere \"E\" is the heat of adsorption, equal to \"E\" at the sample surface and to \"E\" otherwise.\n\nIt is still not clear on how to find the linear range of the BET plot for microporous materials in a way that reduces any subjectivity in the assessment of the monolayer capacity. Rouquerol et al. suggested a procedure that is based on two criteria:\n\nThe rate of curing of concrete depends on the fineness of the cement and of the components used in its manufacture, which may include fly ash, silica fume and other materials, in addition to the calcinated limestone which causes it to harden. Although the Blaine air permeability method is often preferred, due to its simplicity and low cost, the Nitrogen BET method is also used.\n\nWhen hydrated cement hardens, the calcium silicate hydrate (or C-S-H), which is responsible for the hardening reaction, has a large specific surface area because of its high porosity. This porosity is related to a number of important properties of the material, including the strength and permeability, which in turn affect the properties of the resulting concrete. Measurement of the specific surface area using the BET method is useful for comparing different cements. This may be performed using adsorption isotherms measured in different ways, including the adsorption of water vapour at temperatures near ambient, and adsorption of Nitrogen at 77 K (the boiling point of liquid nitrogen). Different methods of measuring cement paste surface areas often give very different values, but for a single method the results are still useful for comparing different cements.\n\nFor example, activated carbon strongly adsorbs many gases and has an adsorption cross section formula_25 of 0.162 nm for nitrogen adsorption at liquid-nitrogen temperature (77 K). BET theory can be applied to estimate the specific surface area of activated carbon from experimental data, demonstrating a large specific surface area, even around 3000 m/g. However, this surface area is largely overestimated due to enhanced adsorption in micropores, and more realistic methods should be used for its estimation, such as the subtracting pore effect (SPE) method.\n\nIn the field of solid catalysis, the surface area of catalysts is an important factor in catalytic activity. inorganic materials such as mesoporous silica and layered clay minerals have high surface areas of several hundred m/g calculated by the BET method, indicating the possibility of application for efficient catalytic materials.\n\nThe ISO 9277 standard for calculating the specific surface area of solids is based on the BET method.\n\n"}

Upon publication it was nonetheless listed as his “String Quartet No. 12.” (Schubert did also compose the first 40 bars of the next movement, \"Andante\".) The nine-minute work is regarded as an early product of the composer’s mature phase of output.\n\nSchubert began work on his twelfth string quartet in early December 1820, shortly after a \"Schubertiade\" held at the home of Ignaz von Sonnleithner on the first of the month. It was his first attempt at writing a string quartet since completing the String Quartet No. 11 in E major, D 353 in 1816.\n\nAfter completing the \"allegro assai\" first movement, Schubert wrote out the 41 bar exposition of the following \"andante\" movement before abandoning the work.\n\nAs with the later \"Unfinished\" Symphony, there has been much speculation on why Schubert left the composition incomplete. One view presented by Bernard Shore is that Schubert put it aside to follow up another musical idea and never got back to it. Javier Arrebola speculates that the work (like several others written during the same period) was put aside because it \"...did not yet represent the great leap forward he was striving for.\" It has also been speculated that the work was abandoned because Schubert, having written a powerful first movement, was unable to come up with an effective following movement.\n\nFollowing Schubert's death the manuscript score eventually found its way into the ownership of Johannes Brahms. The \"Quartettsatz\" received its posthumous premiere on 1 March 1867 in Vienna, with publication of the score, edited by Brahms, following in 1870.\n\nFor a number of years it was believed that the \"Quartettsatz\" was an early work dating to around 1814 (perhaps a confusion with the \"Quartettsatz\" in C minor D 103). In 1905, Edmondstoune Duncan wrote of the composition that it was \"...fairly workman-like and effective, but is of little further consequence, and is only mentioned by way of completeness.\" Later opinion, such as Maurice Brown's comment that the quartet was \"...the only movement in Schubert's instrumental work, prior to the 'Unfinished' Symphony, which prepares us for the greatness which bursts forth in that symphony,\" established the work's true importance as a forerunner of the late string quartets which are among Schubert's greatest works. Four years after the \"Quartettsatz,\" Schubert returned to the genre to write the \"Rosamunde\" Quartet, D 804, which was followed by the \"Death and the Maiden\" Quartet D 810 and the Fifteenth Quartet, D 887.\n\nThe composition consists of a single sonata form movement marked \"Allegro assai\" and typical performances last nine minutes.\n\nIn 2004 the Oregon String Quartet premiered the \"Quartettsatz\" coupled with a completed version of the Andante composed by Livingston Gearhart in 1990.\n\nDuring 2012 the Brentano String Quartet performed the \"Quartettsatz\" as part of their \"Fragments Project\", for this concert series the composition was paired with a work entitled \"Fra(nz)g-mentation\" by composer Bruce Adolphe that was based on Schubert's Andante sketches.\n\n\n"}

Fawcett created two black-and-white ashcan #1 issues to solicit advertisers and to secure the copyrights to the material.

Foulger attended the University of Utah and started acting through his participation in community theatre. Foulger was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints..\n\nHe made his Broadway debut in March 1920 in a production of \"Medea\" featuring Moroni Olsen, and performed in four more productions with Olsen on the 'Great White Way', back-to-back, ending in April 1922. He then toured with Olsen's stock company, and ended up at the Pasadena Playhouse, where he both acted and directed.\n\nFoulger made his first three films in 1932 and 1936 with small roles in \"Night World\" (1932), \"The Little Minister\", and \"The President's Mystery\", the latter based on a story by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. However, his film career did not start in earnest until 1937 after he performed opposite Mae West in a racy 'Adam and Eve' sketch on the Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy network radio program which resulted in West being banned from the airwaves almost immediately. (Foulger played the voice of the serpent.) From this point on, Foulger worked steadily in motion pictures.\n\nHe played many parts: storekeepers, hotel desk clerks, morticians, professors, bank tellers, ministers, confidence men, and a host of other characterizations, usually timid, whining, weak-willed, shifty, sanctimonious or sycophantic. His earliest films show him clean-shaven, but in the 1940s he adopted a wispy mustache that emphasized his characters' worried manner. When the mustache went gray in the 1950s, he reverted to a clean-shaven look. Foulger was a resourceful actor and often embellished his scripted lines with memorable bits of business: in \"The Falcon Strikes Back\", for example, hotel clerk Foulger announces a homicide by bellowing across the lobby: \"Mur-\"der!\" Mur-\"der!\"'\n\nIn real life, Foulger was not as much of a pushover as the characters he played. In one memorable incident at a party he threatened to punch Errol Flynn for flirting with his wife, the actress Dorothy Adams, with whom he was married from 1921 until his death in 1970.\n\nIn the 1940s, Foulger was part of Preston Sturges' unofficial \"stock company\" of character actors, appearing in five films written by Sturges, \"The Great McGinty\", \"Sullivan's Travels\", \"The Palm Beach Story\", \"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek\" (recreating the role of McGinty's secretary he played in \"The Great McGinty\") and \"The Great Moment\". In \"A\" pictures, such as those of Sturges', Foulger often received no screen credit: In B movies such as 1939's \"The Man They Could Not Hang\", he got more substantial, billed parts.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Foulger was so well established as a mild-mannered worrywart that just the showing of his face would receive a welcoming audience laugh (this happens in the cameo-laden Frank Capra comedy \"Pocketful of Miracles\"). In a humorous coup, the actor was cast against type for the most prominent role of his career: he played the Devil opposite The Bowery Boys in \"Up in Smoke\", and was billed in ads and posters as one of the film's three stars.\n\nBeginning in 1950, Foulger made over 90 appearances on television, in programs such as \"Death Valley Days\", \"I Love Lucy\", \"The Cisco Kid\", \"My Little Margie\", \"The Man Behind the Badge\", \"The Lone Ranger\", \"Maverick\", \"Lawman\", \"The Red Skelton Show\", \"Rawhide\", \"Wagon Train\", \"Bonanza\", \"Burke's Law\", \"Daniel Boone\", \"Hazel\", \"The Patty Duke Show\", \"The Monkees\", \"Perry Mason\", \"Laredo\", \"Gunsmoke\", and, in 1965, \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". He played multiple-episode characters on \"Dennis the Menace\" (\"Mr. Timberlake\"), \"Lassie\" (\"Dan Porter\") and \"The Andy Griffith Show\" (\"Fred, the hotel clerk\"). On \"Petticoat Junction\" he played two recurring roles: \"Mr. Guerney\" and engineer \"Wendell Gibbs\".\n\nNotable later television credits included the 1959 \"Twilight Zone\" episode \"Walking Distance\" – in which Gig Young tells Foulger, who is playing a drugstore counterman, that he thinks he's seen him before, to which Foulger replies: \"I've got that kind of face\" – the short-lived comedies \"My Mother the Car\" (as one of the villain's browbeaten advisors) and \"Captain Nice\" (as the hero's often silent father), and \"The Mod Squad\", his last appearance in episodic television.\n\nByron Foulger's last film appearances were in \"The Love War\", a TV movie, and \"There Was a Crooked Man...\", both in 1970. \n\nHe died of heart problems in Hollywood on 4 April 1970, at the age of 70, and is buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. Foulger died on the same day the final episode of \"Petticoat Junction\" was broadcast, in which he played train engineer Wendell Gibbs. He was survived by his wife Dorothy Adams and daughter, Rachel Ames, both actresses.\n\n"}

On January 4, 1969, the Bridge Line subway was extended as the PATCO Speedline to a park-and-ride terminus at Lindenwold. Kirkwood station was simultaneously replaced by Lindenwold. PRSL service was cut back from Philadelphia to Lindenwold; passengers had to transfer to reach Philadelphia. This forced transfer hurt already dwindling ridership, and the service (by then operated by Conrail and funded by the state) ended on June 30, 1982.\n\nOn May 21, 1989, Amtrak began operating the \"Atlantic City Express\" service from New York and Washington to Atlantic City, with Lindenwold as an intermediate stop. NJ Transit began operating local service between Atlantic City and Lindenwold on September 17, 1989. Some NJ Transit trains were extended from Lindenwold to Philadelphia on May 2, 1993. NJ Transit opened Cherry Hill station on July 2, 1994; Amtrak began stopping there instead of Lindenwold. Amtrak service to Atlantic City ended entirely on April 2, 1995; all NJ Transit service was extended to Philadelphia at that time. However, Lindenwold is still commonly used to transfer between NJ Transit and PATCO service.\n\nIn 2011, NJ Transit began construction of a new PATCO waiting room, Atlantic City Line shelter, a new platform entrance, and other work. The modifications were originally intended to be completed in 2012, but took until 2014.\n\n"}

Released on the VHS, Betamax, Laserdisc and VHD formats, the first part was a major commercial success upon release in 1985, selling over 216,000 copies in Japan, mostly to video rental stores. At a price of , the first part grossed approximately from video sales in Japan. The film's concept of a simulated reality has drawn comparisons to later films including \"Dark City\" (1998), \"The Matrix\" (1999) and \"Existenz\" (1999).\n\nMegazone 23's story is set in the far future of the human race, after, in the early 24th century, various environmental issues rendered Earth uninhabitable, forcing humanity to leave in several massive colony ships, the titular Megazones. The story itself follows the population of Megazone Two Three, based on an unnamed part of Japan.\n\nThe first two parts occur roughly 500 years after humanity left Earth, as the government attempt to hack into the civic computer, Bahamut, for their city, in order to use the city's benevolent artificial intelligence, known as EVE, to influence the people to help them in a near-endless war against the Dezalg.\n\nThrown into this is Shogo Yahagi, after he is given ownership of a strange experimental bike by an old friend of his. Over the course of the story, he discovers how false his world is, and eventually makes contact with the EVE Program, who enlists him to assist humanity in any way he can.\nHowever, unfortunately, before he can do anything meaningful, the city's government have become focused on the destruction of the Dezalg, and have decided to terminate Shogo and EVE, who has fled into cyberspace.\nIn the end, Eve manages to save Shogo and his friends, sending them in Bahamut's system core to Earth as the battling ships are destroyed, ending the conflict, at the price of an unknown number of people on both ships.\n\nThe third part occurs several centuries after this, with a hacker named Eiji Takanaka, who is scouted by a rebel group working against the teachings of a mysterious spiritual leader known as Bishop Won Dai. Sion, a high-ranking member of the rebel group, who work under the aegis of Orange Amusements, begins scouting Eiji, while also investigating a strange program, Project Heaven, the E=X Bureau, Won Dai's elite staff, are preparing.\nSion manages to confront Eiji as Orange attempt to stop whatever Project Heaven is, and, badly wounded, instructs Eiji to go to the lowest point in the city, finding the real, centuries-old, Eve Tokimatsuri, who was meant to be awoken by Shogo Yahagi.\nShe takes him to Bahamut, meeting the independent version of Eve from the previous two parts, while Sion manages to stop Orange from making the same mistake as several centuries before, using it to broadcast the E=X's master plan.\nIn the end, Eiji and Eve confront Won Dai, and he is slain, Eve heading to the ADAM moonbase to shut down and destroy it, while also taking out the city's computer, finally beginning the final part of the plan enacted around a millennia before, while Eiji heads off to meet with Ryo to begin his life anew.\n\n\"Megazone 23\" was conceived as a 12-episode television series set to air on Fuji TV, but it was changed to a direct-to-video project after the sponsors withdrew their support mid-production. According to Noboru Ishiguro, the end result was a \"compilation movie\" of already produced episodes. \"Megazone\" was not conceived as a multi-part story. As such, the original release of \"Part I\" lacks the subtitle that has been added to subsequent re-releases.\n\nOriginal mecha designs for the OVA series were created by Shinji Aramaki, while character designs were made by Toshihiro Hirano and Haruhiko Mikimoto, who would provide Eve Tokimatsuri's character designer for all three parts. For \"Part II\", Yasuomi Umetsu was the character designer, and for \"Part III\", Hiroyuki Kitazume took over.\n\nThe original planned title was \"Omega City 23,\" then \"Vanity City\" and \"Omega Zone 23,\" but trademark issues compelled the producers to a title change. The number \"23\" was originally a reference to the 23 municipal wards of Tokyo. In the retroactive continuity established by Part III, the number refers to the 23rd man made city-ship, with Megazone 1 named \"Big Apple.\" However, the title is pronounced \"Megazone Two Three\" as referenced by several reference books and anime magazines published during the release of the series, the Japanese Wikipedia entry, and even within the series itself in \"Day of Liberation.\"\n\nAn ad on the Japanese crowdfunding platform Campfire listed that AIC are working on a remake and a new project in the series.Soon after, AIC announced that the project would be a remake of the series titled \"Megazone 23 SIN\", and a sequel titled \"Megazone XI\" would also be in production with character designer Masahiko Komino. At AnimeJapan 2019, AIC announced that only Parts I and II of the original \"Megazone\" series would be remade in the reboot series.\n\n\"Part I\" was spliced with \"Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross\" by Carl Macek to create \"\" in 1986.\nThe new cut reestablished Shogo's character as Mark Landry\n\nThe Japanese \"International Edition\" of Part 2 has an English-language voice cast that Carl Macek had orchestrated. The consequent adaptation rewrote Shogo as \"Johnny Winters\" and Yui as \"Sue.\" This creates a continuity error, as the name that appears on her bike helmet remains unchanged. The International Edition also added a narration to the exclusive alternate footage from \"Robotech: The Movie\"; the retooled scene became an introduction to Part 2.\n\n\"Megazone Part II International\" was released on laserdisc in Japan. It was not included in the out-of-print DVD Box Set, but was available as a bonus item to those who purchased all three installments individually. It is currently available as a Region 2 DVD bundled with the Limited Edition of the PS3 game \"\". Streamline Pictures later released a straight-dubbed version of Part 1 in 1994. Streamline Pictures released an unedited dubbed version of Part 1 to VHS in 1995, which was released to DVD in 1998 by Image Entertainment. Streamline also planned on releasing the other two parts, but were unable due to a dispute with their distributor Orion Pictures. Manga Entertainment also released a dubbed version of Part 3 in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2004, ADV Films released each installment of the series with a newly produced English dub and the original Japanese language track. The 2004 editions also contained extensive liner notes on the development of \"Megazone 23\". ADV released a complete collection in 2007. With the closure of ADV in 2009, the series is now out-of-print in the US. \"Megazone 23\" was remastered onto Blu-ray in Japan, and released on November 27, 2015. AnimEigo announced on their website that they launched a Kickstarter campaign of this series, similar to Bubblegum Crisis before.\n\nPublisher ADV has compared and found many similarities between the \"Megazone 23\" series and \"The Matrix\" (1999), but The Wachowskis have denied it was an influence during the development of the film series. \"Megazone 23\" has also drawn comparisons to the films \"Dark City\" (1998) and \"Existenz\" (1999).\n\nCharacter and vehicles from Megazone 23 appear in \"Super Robot Wars D\" for the Game Boy Advance.\n\nIn 2007, a video game based on the series, entitled \"\", was released in Japan for the PlayStation 3.\n\n"}

The ThD, like the ecclesiastical Doctor of Sacred Theology (STD), is an advanced research degree equivalent to the Doctor of Philosophy.\n\nIn the academic study of theology, which is deeply rooted in the Christian religion, doctoral students are often conferred a Doctor of Theology, a Doctor of Philosophy, a Doctor of Ministry, a Doctor of Practical Theology or Doctor of Sacred Theology. However, the Doctor of Ministry is generally understood as a professional doctorate.\n\nIn the United States, some of the older theological seminaries began offering the Doctor of Theology (ThD) as an equivalent to the research Doctor of Philosophy. In Princeton Theological Seminary, for example, this practice was inherited from the German system of education since the professors involved in establishing the doctoral program were trained in German universities. Princeton Theological Seminary has since switched to using Doctor of Philosophy as its main designation. A similar shift happened at Harvard Divinity School in 2015. The only Association of Theological Schools accredited schools currently accepting students to ThD programs are Duke Divinity School and Evangelical Seminary.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Doctor of Theology is a fairly new doctoral program. Certain universities have begun offering it as a form of practical doctorate, focused on practices and assessed at the same level as the PhD. To offer a doctorate that helping distinguishes the more practical nature of the degree, some British universities have adopted the term Doctor of Practical Theology.\n"}
{"id": "2065994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2065994", "title": "Cover (law)", "text": "Cover (law)\n\nCover is a term used in the law of contracts to describe a remedy available to a buyer who has received an anticipatory repudiation of a contract for the receipt of goods. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the buyer is permitted (but not required) to find another source of the same type of goods. The buyer may then file a lawsuit against the breaching seller to recover the difference, if any, between the cost of the goods offered and the cost of the goods actually purchased.\n\nThe possibility of cover will prevent a party from being able to sue for specific performance, which is an equitable remedy that requires the buyer have no adequate remedy at law. If the buyer is able to buy elsewhere and sue for the difference, that provides an adequate remedy. This prohibition does not apply, however, to the sale of unique goods such as original works of art, collectibles, real estate, and exclusive rights.\n\nJudge Richard Posner has suggested that the availability of cover allows for efficient breach - that is, that it encourages the most efficient allocation of resources by allowing a seller to breach a contract to sell goods to one buyer when another, more lucrative opportunity comes along. The seller may thus be able to realize a sufficiently increased profit to make more money even after repaying the difference to the original buyer. Therefore, no value is lost in the transaction because the original buyer is in the same position he would have been in but for the breach, and the seller is in a better position.\n"}

After his studies, he worked in his father's company. In 1972, when his father died, he inherited the major part of the family business.\n\nAs the sole owner of the Friedrich Flick Industrial Holding (Industrieverwaltung), he had interests in major companies including Daimler-Benz, WR Grace, Gerling Insurance, Buderus, Dynamit Nobel, Feldmühle and others.\n\nIn 1975 he sold his part of Daimler-Benz to the Deutsche Bank for more than $ 1 billion. Major tax liabilities were avoided through \"cultivation of the political landscape\",—a process that turned into the Flick Affair in 1983 when it became apparent that about $25 million had been paid to German political parties in return for tax cuts and favorable rulings. Although Chancellor Helmut Kohl benefited from the dealings, he claimed he had \"no recollections\", while others resigned from their posts. In 1985 Flick sold off the remainder of his companies. When Deutsche Bank announced that it had bought his holdings for about $3 billion German marks, Flick retired in Austria, where he became a naturalised citizen.\n\nIn March 2006, his estimated net worth was $6.1 billion.\n\nHe married three times and had two children from his second and third marriages. At the time of his death, he was the wealthiest person living in Austria.\n\nHe died on 5 October 2006 at his villa in Auen on the Wörthersee, Austria.\n\nIn November 2008, it was reported that an oak coffin containing his remains was taken from his family's mausoleum at a cemetery at Velden am Wörther See, in what Austrian Federal Police believe may be an attempt to extort money from his widow. His widow Ingrid Flick, his third wife, inherited an estimated £4bn. She and his children are now under police guard. The body was returned in 2009.\n\n"}

He also used the pseudonym \"Arnošt Bellis\".\n\nHe attended secondary school (gymnasium) in Hradec Králové and later started to study Czech, history and French at university in Prague but didn't finish.\n\nStarting in 1908, he was a contributor to the Brno newspaper \"Lidové noviny\". His serialized novel \"Liška Bystrouška\" (\"Vixen Sharp Ears\"), written to accompany a series of drawings by Stanislav Lolek, appeared in the \"Lidové noviny\" between 7 April and 23 June 1920, was published as a book in 1921, won a state prize and achieved lasting popularity. This optimistic tale, somewhere between a children's fairy tale and adult satire, was used as the basis for Leoš Janáček's opera \"The Cunning Little Vixen\" (\"Příhody Lišky Bystroušky\", 1923).\n\nSome of Těsnohlídek's other work reflects more pessimism and alienation than the lighthearted Vixen's tale.\n\nHis life, as interpreted by his journalistic colleague Bedřich Golombek, was a melodramatic tragedy imbued with pessimism, darkness, melancholy and decadence, a life plagued from childhood by feelings of sadness and social exclusion. In his teens, he watched helplessly as a friend drowned. When he was 21, he married Jindra Kopecká, a woman with tuberculosis. Two months after their wedding, on a holiday in Norway, she shot herself in the heart in front of him, possibly accidentally. Těsnohlídek was accused of murdering her, and had to endure two trials before being acquitted. In 1907 he moved to Brno, where he became a reporter of \"soudničky\" (cases from the local magistrate's court) for \"Lidové noviny\". After he had met Janáček and discussed plans for the opera based on \"Liška Bystrouška\", he married again, but this wife left him. He married a third time. He became interested in exploring the Moravian caves, wrote extensively about them, and submitted his drafts for publication but found they had been heavily edited without his knowledge. On 12 January 1928, he shot himself, as his first wife had done. His third wife gassed herself to death on hearing the news.\n\n\"Vixen Sharp Ears\" was first published in English in 1985, as \"The Cunning Little Vixen\", with pictures by Maurice Sendak.\n\nShortly before Christmas 1919, Těsnohlídek and some friends were walking in the woods outside the town of Bílovice nad Svitavou a few kilometres to the north of Brno when they discovered an abandoned and in danger of freezing girl aged seventeen months.

It was commissioned by the renowned clarinetist Ferdinand Troyer and came from the same period as two of Schubert's other major chamber works, the 'Rosamunde' and 'Death and the Maiden' string quartets.\n\nConsisting of six movements, the Octet takes almost an hour to perform.\nThe Octet boasts the largest scale for any chamber work by Schubert. It is scored for a clarinet, a bassoon, a horn, two violins, a viola, a cello, and a double bass. This instrumentation is similar to that of the Beethoven Septet, differing only by the addition of a second violin.\n\nIn response to a reported request by Troyer for a work similar to Beethoven's Septet, Op. 20, Schubert composed the Octet in early 1824. The work was first performed at the home of Troyer's employer, the Archduke Rudolf (to whom Beethoven's Archduke Trio is dedicated) and included many of the musicians who premiered the Septet.\n\nThe basic structure of the movements is similar to those of the Septet, as are many of the key relationships between the movements and principal key (E-flat for the Septet, F major of the Octet).\nThe theme of the first movement is derived from Schubert's song \"Der Wanderer\". The fourth movement variations are based on a theme from Schubert's Singspiel \"Die Freunde von Salamanka\".\n\nThe Melos Ensemble was founded to perform works such as the Octet for wind instruments and strings. The Octet was recorded in 1967 with Gervase de Peyer (clarinet), William Waterhouse (bassoon), Neill Sanders (horn), Emanuel Hurwitz and Ivor McMahon (violin), Cecil Aronowitz (viola), Terence Weil (cello) and Adrian Beers (double bass).\n\nA recording of the chamber ensemble of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields with Iona Brown (violin I) and Timothy Brown (horn) won a Grand Prix du Disque.\n\nThe Camerata Freden recorded it in 2003 with Adrian Adlam (violin I), Cristiano Gualco (violin II), Michael Hesselink (clarinet), Marjolein Dispa (viola), Michel Dispa (cello), Ilka Emmert (double-bass), Letizia Viola (bassoon) and Ron Schaaper (horn).\n\nJanine Jansen (violin I) along with Gregory Ahss (violin II), Nimrod Guez (viola), Nicolas Alstaedt (cello), Rick Stotijn (double bass), Andreas Ottensamer (clarinet), Fredrik Ekdahl (bassoon) and Radek Baborák (horn) performed, and (video) recorded, the piece at the International Chamber Music Festival 2015 in Utrecht. \n\n"}

He is the Mayor of Invercargill and was previously Mayor of Waitemata City.\n\nShadbolt was born in the Auckland suburb of Remuera in 1947. His father died in a flying accident in 1952. He was on the school council and appointed prefect.\n\nShadbolt became a founding student of Rutherford College, Auckland, and attended the University of Auckland from 1966 to 1970, taking a year off in 1967 to work on the Manapouri Power Project in Southland. He was a member of the Auckland University Students Association executive, and editor of \"Craccum\" in 1972. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he became prominent in the \"Progressive Youth Movement\", a radical left-wing organisation, and was arrested 33 times during political protests, most famously for using the word \"bullshit\"; this incident influenced the title of his 1971 autobiography \"Bullshit & Jellybeans\".\n\nAfter 1970, he founded a commune and concrete cooperative at Huia.\n\nShadbolt claims he stood for Mayor of Waitemata City in 1983 because he did not want to see the incumbent Tony Covic re-elected unopposed. He won the election. He famously celebrated, much to some people's disgust, by towing his concrete mixer (named \"Karl Marx\")\nbehind the mayoral Daimler in the 1983 Henderson Christmas parade. He won again in 1986 heading a political ticket called \"Tim's Team\", but in 1989 lost the following mayoral election in the newly formed Waitakere city (an enlarged Waitemata city) to Assid Corban.\nDuring his term as mayor he became infamous by twice losing the mayoral chains.\n\nHe stood in the electorate of West Auckland (which incorporated Waitemata) at the 1990 New Zealand general election as an independent. He placed fifth with 3.06 per cent of the vote. Later that year, he unsuccessfully stood in a by-election for Mayor of Auckland City, polling a distant eighth place. Two years later he stood again for Mayor of Auckland City, where he finished third place with a slightly increased share of the vote. Later that year, he stood in the Wellington Central by-election as an independent candidate, polling less than half a percentage point.\n\nIn 1993, Shadbolt ran successfully for the position of Mayor of Invercargill.\nIn 1994, he contested the Selwyn by-election as a candidate for New Zealand First, but was placed fourth, and remained Mayor of Invercargill. He was defeated in 1995. In the 1996 general election he stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party.\n\nIn 1998, Shadbolt was re-elected to the mayoralty and has remained the mayor ever since. In 2001 he was re-elected unopposed.\n\nIn October 2002, Shadbolt told a conference of New Zealand's Disabled Persons Assembly that Invercargill had \"an innovative approach to public transport, currently centred on 'Freebie the Bus' travelling the 'Purple Circle'\". He said he hoped that in future all buses in Invercargill would be free and accessible. (\"The Freebie\" and \"Purple Circle\" are zero-fare bus routes in Invercargill.)\n\nIn 2004 and 2007, he won his fourth and fifth mayoral terms by huge margins. In 2010, he won his sixth Invercargill mayoral election. Shadbolt received 16,466 votes over mayoral candidates Suzanne Prentice (5,361 votes) and Carl Heenan (682 votes). The 2010 election win made Shadbolt the longest-serving mayor in New Zealand, with this being his 8th mayoral term (his 6th term in Invercargill).\nOn 8 October 2016 he again won re-election as Invercargill's mayor. He said this was his toughest campaign yet. \"I’ve had two candidates both going flat-out and it was a tough election\", he said.\n\"In the past I’ve had either no contenders, but this time I had a television producer and a sitting councillor who had also been an investigative journalist, so it was pretty tough opposition.\" He was returned for another term in 2019.\n\nShadbolt has one son from an early marriage. He met his second wife, Miriam Cameron, in 1970. They have two sons. Cameron left Shadbolt in 1989 after alleged repeated domestic violence. They divorced three years later.\n\nShadbolt's current partner is lawyer Asha Dutt and they have one son.\n\nHe has presented several television documentaries, and the series \"That's Fairly Interesting\".\n\nIn the 1990s he appeared in an advertisement promoting New Zealand cheese, where he humorously repeated the phrase \"I don't care where as long as I'm mayor\", referencing his dual mayoralties. He admitted later that the phrase was developed by an advertising agency.\n\nIn 2001, he appeared as a contestant on a celebrity special of The Weakest Link.\n\nIn 2005, New Zealand Toastmasters awarded him the \"Communicator of the Year\" award. He also played in the movie \"The World's Fastest Indian\", portraying a good friend of Burt Munro who organised social events for Invercargill's motorcycling community.\n\nHe also participated in the \"New Zealand version\" of \"Dancing with the Stars\" where he placed 3rd. In 2006 Shadbolt played the part of the Narrator in The Rocky Horror Show by the Invercargill Musical Theatre. He continued his theatre experiences by appearing in 2007 in the Invercargill Musical Theatres production of Sea Cruise.\n\nIn 2010, Shadbolt appeared on the comedy gameshow 7 Days as the guest participant in the round \"Yes, Minister\".\n\nIn 2012, Shadbolt set the Guinness World Record for the longest television interview. He was interviewed for 26 consecutive hours by interviewer Tom Conroy. In doing so the pair also set the record for the longest single event in New Zealand television history. Shadbolt later said he would have liked to keep going. The record was broken in 2013 by Norwegian novelist Hans Olav Lahlum.\n\nHe was knighted in the 2019 New Year Honours List as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM).\n\n\n"}

The company was established in 1980 and began vehicle manufacturing in that year, having taken over the facilities of Chrysler Australia. Australian production ceased in 2008 and since that time the company has been exclusively a vehicle importer. MMAL spare parts facilities are located in Adelaide and Sydney.\n\nConstruction of the vehicle assembly plant at Tonsley Park was commenced by the then owners, Chrysler Australia, in 1963, and the assembly plant was opened in October 1964. Chrysler's previous plant at Keswick then shut down and was sold to the former Adelaide retailer, Le Cornu Furniture, who renovated the building for its grand reopening in 1973. In 1968, Chrysler opened an engine manufacturing plant south of Adelaide at Lonsdale, to provide engines for the popular Chrysler Valiant models that were being produced at their Tonsley Park facility.\n\nAfter the acquisition by parent company Chrysler of a 15 percent interest in Mitsubishi Motors Corporation in 1971, Chrysler Australia began building Mitsubishi-designed Chrysler-branded vehicles, namely the Chrysler Valiant Galant (later Chrysler Galant), based on the 1972–1977 Mitsubishi Galant and the Chrysler Sigma, a variant of the 1977–1985 Mitsubishi Galant. In 1979, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation each acquired a one sixth equity in Chrysler Australia. The collective price paid for the two-sixths equity was . On 30 April 1980, the two Japanese companies assumed 98.9 percent control by paying a further $52 million to acquire Chrysler's remaining 65 percent share. The remaining 1.1 percent was held by 690 local investors. The company name was changed to Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited on 1 October 1980. Production of the popular Sigma range of vehicles continued under the Mitsubishi name until 1987 with its eventual replacement, the Magna, having been released in 1985. Colt production, which had commenced in 1982, ended in 1990, with no locally manufactured replacement.\n\nThe Magna, like its forebear the Sigma, was based on the Japanese Galant. Input from MMAL resulted in a wider car than the Japanese donor model to suit the Australian market and to compete with the popular Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore. A station wagon variant was added to the model lineup in 1987. The Magna received several model refreshes during the 1990s including a luxury variant named Verada. However, by the early 2000s, it was clear that the Magna / Verada line, now in its third iteration had aged considerably. A facelift to the Magna / Verada line in 2003 failed to lift sales. After lobbying from Mitusubishi Motors Australia Limited (MMAL) approval for construction of a new vehicle was granted by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. Funding was provided to reengineer the Tonsley Park plant with the result that a new vehicle, the Mitsubishi 380, was delivered to the market in late 2005.\n\nIn 2003 MMAL gained approval from MMC to create Mitsubishi Research and Development Australia (MRDAus) with a budget of $30 million. MRDAus was to be the fourth global Mitsubishi Research and Development Centre. MMAL's proving ground at Tailem Bend was to be upgraded including the addition of a high speed oval and numerous other proving ground facilities and the Testing and Proving group's laboratories at MMAL headquarters in Tonsley Park was also to be upgraded. MRDAus was originally tasked with completing Mitsubishi 380 Testing and Proving prior to the start of volume production. MRDAus also negotiated substantial job share for the testing and proving of the PS41L, the codename for a stretched 380 for the US market. Unfortunately with the financial woes facing MMC globally and the cancelling of the PS41L program MRDAus was unable to reach its full potential. In late 2004 after expanding to 90 personnel the MRDAus expansion was halted before the 380 was even launched. A security fence around most of the expanded Tailem Bend site was almost completed and the earthworks for the high speed oval had begun when work was halted in 2004.\n\nMitsubishi Motors Corporation's financial and legal issues weighed hard on MMAL, with public perception of the viability of the company reaching an all-time low in 2004. Company research conducted in mid-2004 revealed that roughly four out of every five believed that Mitsubishi would cease production in Australia.\n\nThe withdrawal of DaimlerChrysler from its involvement with Mitsubishi Motors Corporation in 2004, along with the revitalisation plan that called for the closure of the Lonsdale engine plant, did not help the public's perception of MMAL as a viable company.\n\nMMAL ended 2004 with a stockpile of approximately 4,000 unsold Magnas and Veradas. To restore consumer confidence in the brand and to clear the model backlog, a series of television advertisements began airing in December 2004. Centred on Mitsubishi Australia's then Chief executive officer, Tom Phillips, the advertisements promoted the introduction of an industry-first five-year/130,000 kilometre warranty. Mitsubishi reworked a slogan from former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, concluding their commercials with the tagline, \"If you can find a better-built, better-backed car anywhere, then buy it\". The campaign successfully boosted sales and allowed the backlog to be cleared.\n\nThe Mitsubishi 380, the successor vehicle to the Magna, raised hopes for the future of MMAL when launched. Hopes stemmed from the sales success that the Magna experienced when it was launched and the fact that the Australian automobile market was growing at the time. However, the 380 sold poorly from its introduction and failed to meet expected sales targets. This resulted in a reduction in daily production volume from 180 to 50 vehicles per day, along with further reductions in the workforce.\n\nSales of other Mitsubishi Motors Corporation vehicles began to show improvement in Asian and European markets as new vehicles were introduced during 2006. These vehicles were also introduced into the Australian market, boosting MMAL's Australian sales into the segments that these vehicles occupied, though this did nothing to help their sales of locally manufactured product.\n\nOn 5 February 2008, it was announced that MMAL would cease production of the 380 at the Tonsley Park plant, effective at the end of March 2008. The two-page statement released announced they would pursue a \"full import strategy\" for the Australian market due to unviable 380 sales. The last Mitsubishi 380 sedan left the production line on 27 March 2008. Coinciding with the last vehicles to leave the line was the redundancy of about 500 workers, with another 430 staying for another 12 months. Those remaining decommissioned the plant and produced a stockpile of spare parts destined to last ten years.\n\nBy late 2009, MMAL had removed the last piece of manufacturing equipment from the Tonsley Park assembly plant. Ownership of the plant was handed over to the Government of South Australia on 16 December 2009.\n\nAt the same time, MMAL began a restructure of the remaining divisions of the company. This restructure concluded in mid-2009 and saw staff numbers reduced to around 300 through redundancy and outsourcing.\n\nThe majority of the remaining staff are involved with sales and marketing activities, though MMAL retains some capability to perform any design changes that may be required to fit Mitsubishi Motors Corporation's global products into the Australian market.\n\nThe 61-hectare Tonsley site is being redeveloped for retail, TAFE facilities, hi-tech manufacturing, with future residential plans.\n\nThe Lonsdale engine manufacturing plant was transformed into the Onkaparinga Recycling plant in 2010.\n\nSince the end of local 380 production, the entire vehicle range that MMAL sells is imported from Japan with the ASX, Outlander and Pajero, and from Thailand with the Mirage, Pajero Sport and Triton.\n\nCurrent passenger cars\n\nCurrent commercial vehicles\n\nFormer passenger cars\n\n\"(Sources: Fact & Figures 2000, Fact & Figures 2005, Fact & Figures 2008, Mitsubishi Motors website)\"\n"}

In 1933 he was arrested and sentenced to nine years in prison. When Northern Transylvania was transferred to Hungary as part of the Second Vienna Award in 1940, he was released and he moved to Budapest. During World War II, he worked within the anti-fascist movement acting as a liaison between groups. When the war ended, Dudás was a member of an unofficial ceasefire delegation that visited Moscow, and he was a founding member of the Liberation Committee of the Hungarian National Uprising.\n\nIn late 1945 he joined the Independent Smallholders' Party and was elected to the Budapest government. As the communists mounted their campaign to take over Hungary, Dudás was arrested and detained until he was handed over to Romanian state security in 1951. Released in 1954, he returned to Hungary.\n\nWorking as an engineer when the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 broke out, he took to addressing crowds and on 29 October, established the Second District National Committee, with a 25-point program demanding, a coalition government, a multi-party system and neutrality. He also started a newspaper (Magyar Függetlenség—Hungarian Independence), which headlined, ‘We do not recognize the present government!’ At this same time the so-called \"Dudás Group\" consisting of about 400 armed men was formed. Dudás soon acquired a bad reputation among the revolutionary forces, as he started negotiations with Colonel Malashenko, acting chief of staff of the Soviet Special Forces, with the aim of being recognized by the Soviets as the main seat of political and military power in Hungary, instead of Imre Nagy. The Dudás group also became known for the campaign of terror it unleashed against members of Hungary's AVH Secret Police, lynching or otherwise executing offenders on sight. The activities of the group went to such an extreme that other revolutionaries began arresting AVH officers for their own protection.\n\nHe continued publishing his newspaper criticizing the Nagy government until his own armed men dismissed him on 3 November, and he was arrested by government forces for acts attributed to him, or rumors of such acts (an attack on the Foreign Ministry; looting of the National Bank). On 4 November he was wounded and taken to a hospital.\n\nOn 21 November he was tricked into entering the Parliament building and was arrested by the Soviets. He was charged with leadership of a conspiracy and on 14 January 1957 he was sentenced to death. He was executed on 19 January 1957.\n"}

Nicknamed \"Big Daddy\", he played college football for the Ohio State University, was recognized as an All-American and received several national awards recognizing him as an outstanding college lineman. He was drafted first overall in the 1994 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Cincinnati Bengals, Washington Redskins, Detroit Lions, and Miami Dolphins of the NFL.\n\nWilkinson was born in Dayton, Ohio. He attended Dunbar High School in Dayton, and played for the Dunbar Wolverines high school football team.\n\nHis football coach at Stivers Intermediate School, Albert Powell, gave Wilkinson the nickname \"Big Daddy\", after convincing him to play defensive line instead of fullback. \"Carl Hairston was in Cleveland at the time, so I told Dan, 'You're our Big Daddy.'\"\n\nWilkinson received an athletic scholarship to attend Ohio State University, where he played for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 1991 to 1993. During his freshman season in 1991, the Buckeyes coaches redshirted and placed him on the scout team. At the time, Wilkinson weighed 348 pounds and played offensive tackle. During the season, he lost 48 pounds and began to play defense.\n\nLining up next to Alonzo Spellman during his sophomore year, Wilkinson earned All-Big Ten honors after he had 46 tackles, 10.5 tackles-for-loss, and 6.5 sacks. Playing under tackle next to nose guard Luke Fickell as a junior in 1993, Wilkinson finished with 44 tackles and 13 tackles-for-loss. He earned first-team All-Big Ten honors and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. He decided to forgo his final season of college eligibility and subsequently declared for the 1994 NFL Draft.\n\nAlong with running back Marshall Faulk and quarterbacks Heath Shuler and Trent Dilfer, Wilkinson was regarded as \"one of the four players who rank well above the others in this draft\". In workouts prior to the draft, Wilkinson weighed in at 315 pounds, bench-pressed 225 pounds 34 times and ran a remarkably fast 40 yards in 4.72 seconds. \"Wilkinson could be a once-in-10-years player,\" said Billy Devaney, then San Diego Chargers' director of player personnel. Also described as \"maybe the best defensive-line prospect since Reggie White [in 1985],\" Wilkinson drew a lot of interest from around the league. Several teams were willing to trade with the Cincinnati Bengals for the No. 1 draft pick, including the New England Patriots, who reportedly offered their first-round pick (4th overall), plus several players including offensive guard Eugene Chung (their first-round choice in 1992), and the Arizona Cardinals, who offered their pick plus running back Garrison Hearst (their 1993 first-rounder). Eventually, the Bengals decided to keep the pick, and decided not to select a quarterback, since they already picked David Klingler in 1992.\n\nBecoming the third defensive lineman in four years—after Russell Maryland and Steve Emtman—to be selected first overall, Wilkinson was chosen by the Bengals. He was only the second Ohio State defensive player to go No. 1, after Tom Cousineau in 1979.\n\nAfter an 11-day holdout, Wilkinson signed a six-year, $14.4 million ($ million in current value) contract with the Cincinnati Bengals on May 5, 1994, becoming the highest-paid player in their franchise history. While in training camp, Bengals coaches compared Wilkinson to All-Pro offensive tackle Anthony Muñoz in terms of talent. Wilkinson remained with the team from to . During his rookie season, Wilkinson led the team with 19 quarterback hurries. He set a season-high and led the team with seven tackles against the Indianapolis Colts on November 20. During the season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles on December 20, Wilkinson volunteered to give up his starting spot so Bengals great Tim Krumrie could start his final home game. Wilkinson still made two sacks in a reserve role.\n\nWilkinson set a career-high with eight quarterback sacks in 1995—a total which led all AFC interior linemen that season and was the most by a Bengals interior lineman since Mike Reid in 1972. Wilkinson's 18 quarterback hurries were second on the team and he played in 829 snaps, second-most on the defensive line. He spent time at both defensive tackle positions and right defensive end. He played the first two games of the regular season with a cast on his hand after breaking his ring finger in the final preseason game. He registered two sacks and led defensive line with five tackles (all solo) in win against the Jacksonville Jaguars on September 10 and sacked quarterback Mark Brunell on fourth down in the final minute of the game to preserve the Bengals win. Wilkinson suffered a neck injury against the Chicago Bears on December 10 and was inactive for the final two games of the season.\n\nWilkinson led the Bengals in sacks for the first time in 1996 with 6.5, including one in each of the first five games, and also led the defensive line with 37 solo tackles. He led a rushing defense which allowed fewest yards per game (102.7) since the 1983 Bengals allowed 93.7. He opened the year with a season-high eight tackles, a sack and five quarterback hurries against the St. Louis Rams on September 1. He made his first career interception against the Baltimore Ravens on November 3, picking off a Vinny Testaverde pass.\n\nIn 1997, Wilkinson played much of the season at right defensive end after the Bengals converted to a 3-4 defense, totaling a team-high five sacks. He was awarded the team's defensive game ball for his play in Cincinnati’s victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on November 23. He missed his only game of the season against the Dallas Cowboys on December 14 with a stinger in his neck.\n\nIn December 1997, Wilkinson clashed with ownership and the city he played in. He was disappointed when the Bengals placed the franchise tag on him during the offseason. He also called Cincinnati a \"racist\" city, saying its residents were \"prejudiced and uptight and stiff.\" The remarks caused owner Mike Brown to act, and on February 26, 1998, Wilkinson was traded to the Washington Redskins. That same week, the Redskins had also acquired the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year, Dana Stubblefield, from the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nWilkinson was very productive during his first season in Washington, leading the team in sacks (7.5), quarterback pressures (50) and tackles-for-loss (six). His 50 quarterback pressures were 30 more than the team's No. 2 man in that category (defensive end Kenard Lang). Wilkinson set career highs in total tackles (60) and solo stops (45), playing in more snaps (1,037) than any other defensive tackle in the NFL that season. He intercepted his second career pass against Philadelphia on November 15 when he picked off the deflected pass deep in Eagles territory and ran four yards before being tackled, setting up the Redskins' first touchdown. He also performed well against the New York Giants on November 1 with 14 QB pressures, seven tackles and a pass deflection. He tied a career-high with eight tackles against the Arizona Cardinals on November 22.\n\nWilkinson led the Redskins with eight sacks to match his career-high from 1995 and finished second in quarterback pressures (43) in 1999. In a Week 7 game against the Chicago Bears, Redskins defensive end Marco Coleman hit Bears quarterback Shane Matthews, forcing the ball into Wilkinson's hands. He returned it (at a comfortable pace) 88 yards for a touchdown, with speedster Darrell Green escorting him most of the way. The play gave the Redskins a 14–0 lead in their 48–22 win over Chicago and was the fourth-longest interception return for a score in Redskins history, the longest such return ever by a Redskins player at home and the longest return ever by a Redskins defensive lineman.\n\nWilkinson also racked up five tackles (three solo), two sacks, five pressures and a pass defensed at the New York Giants on September 19, when he was awarded a game ball along with the rest of the starting defensive line. He recorded a team-high nine pressures, a sack, two solos and one tackle-for-loss against the Arizona Cardinals on December 12.\n\nIn 2000, Wilkinson experienced the lowest sack total of his career at just 3.5 for the year. He made a season-high four tackles on two occasions, at the Dallas Cowboys and at Pittsburgh Steelers in consecutive weeks in mid-December. He had a season-long, nine-yard sack at the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 22.\n\nWhile Wilkinson did not post entirely impressive statistics in 2001, he made key blocks allowing other defensive players to make big plays while also contributing in other ways. His pass deflection on second-and-goal led to an interception by Otis Leverette on the one-yard line and ended a critical scoring threat by the Carolina Panthers on October 21. The Redskins went on to beat the Panthers 17–14 in overtime. Although he posted no stats in the game, Wilkinson's pressure helped hold Philadelphia's offense to only 186 total yards. On the year, Wilkinson finished with 25 tackles (19 solo), four sacks and two interceptions. His two interceptions came off Donovan McNabb and Aaron Brooks.\n\nWilkinson experienced his worst season as a pro in 2002, which would prove to be his last with the Redskins. He recorded one tackle against the Dallas Cowboys on November 28 before leaving the game in the third quarter with a strained right calf. He was placed on injured reserve on December 5, ending his season. In the 12 games he played, he recorded 16 tackles (12 solo) and five pass deflections. It was the first season of his career in which he did not record a sack.\n\nDuring the 2003 offseason, Wilkinson voiced his preference to stay in Washington and it appeared it would happen. The team wanted him to take a pay cut, since they considered Wilkinson's team-high $3.5 million salary \"too much\" for a player who had a career-low 17 tackles and no sacks in 2002. But negotiations with Wilkinson's agent fell through, and he was cut by the team on July 29. Wilkinson received interest from the Dallas Cowboys, Green Bay Packers, and New England Patriots and approximately four other organizations. On August 17, he agreed to sign with the Detroit Lions.\n\nIn Wilkinson's first regular season game with the Lions against the Arizona Cardinals on September 7, he recorded three solo tackles, five quarterback hurries, two passes defensed and a nine-yard sack of quarterback Jeff Blake—the first Lions' sack of the season. His best game of the season came against the Green Bay Packers on November 27 with a sack of Brett Favre, his first fumble recovery of 2003, two quarterback pressures and a season-high six tackles (four solos). He notched a pass defense, two quarterback knockdowns and a pressure against the St. Louis Rams on December 28, helping hold the Rams’ rushing attack to just 41 yards.\n\nDespite modest statistics (24 tackles and two sacks), Wilkinson made a significant impact on the Lions' run defense. He was named to Peter King of Sports Illustrated’s all-pro team.\n\nIn 2004, Wilkinson appeared in all 16 games for the Lions. He was a member of a defensive line unit that registered 30.5 sacks, the seventh-highest total among any front four in the NFL. The unit also started every game together during the season.\n\nWilkinson forced a fumble and sacked Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb for a seven-yard loss against Philadelphia on September 26. He also set a career-high with two forced fumbles during the season. He was also instrumental in the development of younger players, including Pro Bowl defensive tackle Shaun Rogers and defensive end James Hall.\n\nIn the 2005 season, Wilkinson's last with the Lions, he played in all 16 games for the third straight year. He finished the season with 26 tackles (20 solo) and three sacks—his highest total in four seasons.\n\nHe recorded two Trent Dilfer sacks at the Cleveland Browns on October 23, for a loss of 10 yards. His sack in the first quarter for nine yards prevented the Browns from reaching the end zone, and forced a field goal attempt. He recorded his first career safety after punter Nick Harris downed a punt on the 2-yard line against the Arizona Cardinals on November 13. On the ensuing possession, he tackled Cardinals fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo in the end zone in the first quarter. Wilkinson had a sack on December 4 against Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brad Johnson for a loss of seven yards to stop a potential scoring drive and force the Vikings to punt.\n\nDuring the 2006 offseason, the Lions unsuccessfully attempted to trade Wilkinson and subsequently released him on May 22. He received interest from multiple teams, and visited with the Miami Dolphins in early June. The two parties negotiated on a contract, but Wilkinson preferred to not sign until later so as not to go through the rigors of an entire training camp at his age. He officially signed a three-year deal with the team on August 14. It was officially a three-year, $6.31 million contract, although it was structured in a way that would essentially make it a one-year deal. Wilkinson received a $500,000 signing bonus and had a $810,000 in base salary in 2006. His base salary would jump to $2 million in 2007 and $2.5 million in 2008. He is due a $500,000 roster bonus in the 2008 offseason.\n\nWilkinson played in a reserve role most of the season behind Keith Traylor and Jeff Zgonina, battling nagging injuries and dealing with a lawsuit which caused him to miss time. In 10 games played, he recorded 13 tackles (nine solo) and three pass deflections. On December 21, Wilkinson was placed on season-ending injured reserve with knee and hamstring injuries.\n\nIn the 2007 offseason, the Dolphins attempted to trade Wilkinson to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. Wilkinson failed to contact either team, and while deadlines for him to report were extended during the offseason, the trade fell through and was voided on March 31. On June 18, the Dolphins released Wilkinson.\n\n\nThe second-youngest of eleven children, Wilkinson was born in Dayton, Ohio, to Oliver and Veronda Wilkinson.\n\nWilkinson had four children with his ex-wife Shawnda: Brooklyn, Daniel Ramon Jr., Taylor, and Sydné. He is now remarried and has had two more children, Kennedy and Klarke. They reside in Potomac, Maryland.\n\nWilkinson has been involved in a few lawsuits since the start of his professional career. In 1996, Wilkinson pleaded no contest to the charge of domestic violence. He was subsequently found guilty of striking his pregnant girlfriend. Wilkinson's girlfriend, however, stated that she did not wish to pursue prosecution.\n\nIn March 2006, Capital Centre LLC, a joint project headed by the Cordish Company and Washington Sports & Entertainment, sued Wilkinson. The suit alleged that Wilkinson was personally liable for a breach of contract related to a lease the two parties had agreed to. On April 3, 2006, The Maryland federal district court issued an opinion on the validity of the case.\n\n"}

{"id": "2066066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066066", "title": "Elphin, County Roscommon", "text": "Elphin, County Roscommon\n\nElphin (; ) is a small town in north County Roscommon, Ireland. It forms the southern tip of a triangle with Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon to the north west and north east respectively. It is at the junction of the R368 and R369 regional roads. Ireland West Airport Knock is west of Elphin - approximately 40 minutes by road.\n\nElphin has historically been an important market town and the diocesan centre for the Diocese of Elphin. St Patrick is believed to have visited Elphin, consecrated its first church and ordained its first bishop, Asicus (subsequently the patron saint of Elphin). Information supporting the visitation of St Patrick is to be found in two important memorials of early Irish hagiography, the Vita Tripartita of St Patrick, and the \"Patrician Documents\" in the Book of Armagh. On his missionary tour through Connacht in 434 or 435, St Patrick came to the territory of Corcoghlan, present day Elphin. The chief of that territory, a noble Druid named Ono, gave land and afterwards his castle or fort to St Patrick to found a church and monastery. The place, which had hitherto been called Emlagh-Ono (a derivation of its owners name) received the designation of Ail Finn, which means \"rock of the clear spring\". It derives from a story of St Patrick raising a large stone from a well opened by him in the land of Ono and placed on its margin. A copious stream of crystal water flowed from the well and continues to flow through Elphin to this day. St Patrick built a church called Tempull Phadruig (Patrick's church) and established an Episcopal See in Elphin. St Asicus remained as bishop of Elphin. St Patrick also founded an episcopal monastery or college at Elphin, believed to be one of the first monasteries founded by him. In pre-Reformation times, Elphin was host to a large number of religious orders and was a religious centre of international significance. This is supported by the appearance of Elphin in a number of pan-European maps in the Middle Ages. \nAfter the Reformation Elphin continued as the centre of a bishopric. A new bishop's residence was built in the 1720s to the central block and flanking pavilions plan that is very common in Irish country houses of this period. The main block of the bishop's house was destroyed by fire early in the 20th Century and was subsequently demolished, but the ruins of the pavilions survive together with the curtain walls that linked them to the main house.\n\nThe Church of Ireland cathedral was also rebuilt in the eighteenth century. It was a modest building, no bigger than a small parish church, with a tall square clock tower at its west end. An apse was added in the 19th century. The cathedral was used for worship up to 1961. It was badly damaged in a storm on 4 February 1957 and was demolished a few years later, but its partially restored ruins can still be seen.\n\nAssociated with the cathedral was Elphin Diocesan School, popularly known as 'The Latin School'. Its most famous students were Oliver Goldsmith and the eye surgeon Sir William Wilde, father of Oscar Wilde. The school was closed in the 1860s when the seat of the bishopric was moved to Kilmore, County Cavan.\n\nAccording to legend, it was close to Elphin that the mythological figure of Oisin fell from his horse upon his return from Tir na nOg (The Land of Eternal Youth). Within 6 km of Elphin is Cruachan (otherwise Rathcroghan), the famous palace of Queen Meave (she of the Táin Bó Cúailnge and a prominent figure in Irish mythology, notably the Ulster Cycle) and the Connacht kings. The well of Ogulla (otherwise the Virgin Monument), scene of the famous conversion and baptism of Aithnea (Eithne) and Fidelm, the daughters of Leoghari, monarch of Ireland in the time of St Patrick, is also situate near Elphin. It is reputed that the gold and riches of Ned Kelly are buried in foothills just outside Elphin.\n\nAn early 18th century windmill has been restored in the village. The windmill was built between 1720 - 1740. Some accounts state that the windmill was no longer in use and had fallen into disrepair by 1830. This timeline is corroborated by the \"School's Collection\" from the National Folklore Collection, a national survey of local folklore conducted by the schoolchildren of Ireland (including Elphin) dating from May 1938. One entry related to the windmill in Elphin states \"There is a windmill about a quarter of a mile on the north-side of the town. It is in the village of Chanterland and it is on the left-hand side of the road as a person goes from Elphin to Boyle. It is a circular structure and it was well built because although it is very old it is as good as when it was built. There are two doors on it one facing the other but one is filled with stones. There is a stream going by the mill and where the Boyle road crosses it is called The Mill Dam. The stream rises in the Deanery and it flows in an eastern direction. There are none of the mill stones to be seen around the Mill. A man named Culligan who died fifteen years ago said that the Windmill was not worked for eighty years before that\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066076", "title": "Arigna", "text": "Arigna\n\nArigna (, formerly \"Cairn An Ailt\"), is a village in County Roscommon, Ireland. It is near Lough Allen (on the Shannon-Erne Waterway), on a designated \"scenic route\" between Keadue and Sliabh an Iarainn. Arigna is situated in Kilronan Parish alongside the villages of Keadue and Ballyfarnon. The village lies close to the shores of Lough Allen. There is a long association with the mining industry, carried out for over 400 years until the mines closed in 1990.\n\nArigna is an english corruption of , meaning \"the plundering\", an adjective for the Arigna river - , the \"plundering river\". The gaelic name for Arigna was (\"Carn Analt\"). \n\ncodice_1\n\nCairn means \"pile of rocks\", and Ailt (also: ailt, alt) means \"the steep-sided glen, height, cliff\".\n\nThe Arigna Coal Mine is famous for its very shallow deposits. Seams of culm were worked by miners lying on their sides to shovel the coal out. Mining lasted until 1990, and the coal was used for iron works and later for a power plant. With the demolition of the ESB Generating Station chimney, the era of collieries in the area ended.\n\nThe mining history at Arigna started in the Middle Ages with the mining of iron here, and at Sliabh an Iarainn. At the beginning of the 17th century, the iron was smelted at Arigna in new built iron works, using charcoal, which was burnt from the wood of the forests around. But as no organised tree planting took place and the timber eventually ran out, the iron works had to be closed at the end of the 17th century. More than half a century later, in 1765, the mining of the coal deposits started, and again 30 years later the smelting was revived using the local coal instead of charcoal. This iron works closed finally in 1838, as they were not very successful.\n\nDemand for fuel in Dublin drove the industrial and economic development in the region. In 1790s Dublin, years of rising fuel inflation had driven the price of coal to 36-40 shillings per ton, causing \"very great distress\" to the inhabitants of Dublin. The completion of the Royal Canal allowed for the supply and sale of Arigna coal at 10 shillings per ton. New towns and villages emerged. Drumshanbo has its origin in these industries.\n\nCoal mining continued and provided work for the people in the area. The coal was used to heat homes and hospitals, and to power steam engines. In 1958 the Arigna Power Station was opened to produce electricity. It was the first major power generating station in Connacht. The station was built specifically to burn the semi bituminous coal with its high ash content. At its height, the power station burned 55,000 tonnes of coal per year and employed 60 people. Like in other coal mining areas of Europe, the main goal of this power station was to secure the jobs in the local mining industry. During the internationalization process of the mid-20th century, foreign coal from much bigger and easier to mine deposits became much cheaper than local coal. At the end of the 1980s, the power station was shut down, and without its main buyer the mine closed in 1990.\n\nBecause of the thin coal seams, a special type of mining was practised at Arigna. A main tunnel was driven from which branched a series of secondary tunnels every 5–6 meters, where the coal was mined. The secondary tunnels followed the seams and were rather low. The miners typically worked lying on their back to cut the coal. These 'Cutters' or 'Brushers' also prepared the mine for the next day's work, and extended the roads using explosives. 'Drawers' filled hutches (tubs) and pushed them out to the main underground mine road. Here the hutches were linked up to an endless-rope haulage system and were pulled to the outside. Sometimes small diesel locomotives were used to pull hutches out of the pit. 'Proppers' used timber pillars to prop up the mine roof.\n\nIn his memoir, \"The Home Place\", author Brian Leyden gives a description of life in the mines and describes the conditions in which the miners worked: \"The coal mines were often tiny by the standard of most industrialised countries. The men often had to lie on their backs in water, using a handpick or short-handled shovel to get at a thin seam of coal under a ledge of rock.\"\n\nLeyden describes how a religious picture was placed at the pit entrance and that the \"coal-miners blessed themselves at this spot before they went underground. Strangers who visited the mines out of curiosity often found the experience of the mineshaft so frightening they never got past the picture\".\n\nThe Arigna Mining Experience consists of an exhibition and an optional underground tour. The underground tour is guided by former miners, who are able to answer many questions on the coal mining process. This tour is a little difficult for some, as the mine is often somewhat low. There is no need to fear going \"down\" into the mine as the entrance and the whole mine tour is on a single flat level and wheelchair accessible. Visitor get hard hats to protect their heads. Lighting and sound effects throughout the mine are intended to add to the authenticity of the experience.\n\nIn April 2009, a musical celebration of Arigna's mining heritage, \"Scars On the Mountain\" was launched by RTÉ, Ireland's state broadcaster.\n\nArigna railway station opened on 2 May 1888, but finally closed on 1 April 1959. It was part of the narrow gauge Cavan and Leitrim Railway.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2066085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066085", "title": "Captain Nazi", "text": "Captain Nazi\n\nCaptain Nazi is a Fawcett Comics and DC Comics supervillain, a rival of Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr.. As Baron Krieger, Captain Nazi made his first live-action appearance in a 2016 second season episode of The CW TV series \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow\", played by André Eriksen.\n\nCaptain Nazi first appeared in \"Master Comics\" #21 (Dec 1941) and was created by William Woolfolk and Mac Raboy.\n\nThe super-strong Captain Nazi was genetically altered by his scientist father, and developed into the \"perfect specimen\" in order to fight for Adolf Hitler and the Axis Powers during World War II. He is given superhuman strength and stamina, and a special flying gas allows him to fly. He is sent to battle American superheroes by the Nazis after his power is demonstrated to them by Adolf Hitler, and some of the heroes are shown. Nazi first appeared in \"Master Comics\" #21 (December 1941), in opposition to both Captain Marvel and Bulletman. During the second half of his battle with Marvel in \"Whiz Comics\" #25 (published the same month), Nazi attacks two innocent bystanders who happened to be fishing near the scene of the battle, after they pull him out of the lake, and he escapes in their boat. One of them, an old man named Jacob Freeman, is killed, but the old man's teenage grandson, Freddy Freeman, is saved by Captain Marvel although he is crippled and his back broken with a hit from an oar while Nazi escapes in the boat, but due to Captain Marvel bestowing part of his power to him, Freddy becomes Captain Marvel Jr. He is then sent to defeat Captain Nazi by Captain Marvel.\n\nJunior, crippled in his Freddy Freeman form by the attack, continues to hold a vendetta against Nazi, and the two frequently battle one another. Nazi also serves as a member of Mister Mind's Monster Society of Evil, one of the most powerful organisations of villains in the world which included Adolf Hitler, and assists their first plan to steal magic fortune-telling pearls from a princess, leading Captain Marvel to their hideout, and revealing their existence, during the World War II years, before making his final Fawcett Comics appearance in \"Captain Marvel, Jr.\" #14 in 1944.\n\nCaptain Nazi appeared only sporadically in DC Comics' 1970s/1980s revival of the Marvel Family characters under the title \"Shazam!\", save for reprints of the original Fawcett stories. Nazi's first appearance in a new DC Comics story was in \"Shazam!\" #34 (March- April 1978).\n\nFollowing writer Roy Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake's new interpretation of the Captain Marvel mythos in the 1987 four-issue miniseries \"\", Captain Nazi was re-introduced in a 1988 four-part story in \"Action Comics Weekly\" issues #623-626. Captain Nazi himself, however, only appeared in #624-626. The story was written by Thomas and his wife Dann Thomas, with art by Rick Stasi and Rick Magyar. The new Captain Nazi is a young Neo-Nazi named Lester Abernathy. Abernathy is given his \"Captain Nazi\" powers, costume and codename by a Neo-Nazi organization called the Sons of Valhalla and battles Captain Marvel. This version of the character made no further appearances and was subsequently retconned out of existence by the 1994 \"The Power of Shazam!\" graphic novel, which again altered Captain Marvel's background and continuity.\n\nCaptain Nazi was introduced into the modern DC Universe in Jerry Ordway's \"The Power of Shazam!\" series in 1995. In the modern series, Nazi had been active during the 1940s, battling World War II-era heroes such as Bulletman, Minute-Man, and Spy Smasher, but placed himself in suspended animation in a chamber so that he could emerge in modern society and revive the Third Reich. He believed Hitler's body to be held in a similar chamber. Nazi's brother, scientist Wolf Krieger, and his granddaughter, a super-powered villainess named Madame Libertine who possesses mind-controlling powers, carry on Nazi's legacy in the 1990s and resurrect their hero from his suspended animation chamber in \"Power of Shazam!\" #5.\n\nIssues #6–8 of the \"Power of Shazam\" series retell the story of Nazi's murder of Freddy's grandfather by throwing him a great distance with his superhuman strength, his crippling of Freddy, and Freddy's emergence as Marvel, Jr. and attempted revenge on Nazi. His life was actually saved by Freddy who believed the figure who fell into the lake was Captain Marvel, who had just knocked him into the lake. After the Marvel Family captures and defeats Nazi, he is sent to Europe to be tried for war crimes committed during World War II.\n\nCaptain Nazi eventually joins Lex Luthor's new Secret Society of Super Villains as seen in the miniseries \"Villains United,\" where he works with them to torture the Secret Six. He is blinded during the escape of the Secret Six when Catman plunges syringes into his eyes.\n\nCaptain Nazi meets his apparent end in \"Batman\" #647 while fighting Batman and the Red Hood. The Captain, now sporting cybernetic eyes following his injury in \"Villains United\", has been lent out to the villain Black Mask to assassinate the Red Hood alongside fellow Society members Deathstroke, Count Vertigo, and the Hyena. During the fight, the Red Hood apparently kills Captain Nazi by jamming a taser-like weapon into his cybernetic eyes (the only vulnerable part of his body). In \"Villains United Special\" #1 however, it is revealed that Nazi has survived. At the behest of the Society, Nazi appeared in Kahndaq to release all of the captives in its prisons and fights Khandaq's ruler and former Secret Society member, Black Adam. During the battle, Black Adam confronts Nazi about how he seemingly survived being killed, at which time Captain Nazi cryptically proclaims that previous origins about him were wrong and that the villain is not even human; that he is the living avatar of National Socialism given physical form and that so long as there are Nazis in existence, he will exist. Captain Nazi was able to stalemate Black Adam in the battle afterwards.\n\nHe has since appeared as leader of a Nazi-themed team in \"Justice Society of America\" named \"The Fourth Reich\" after the \"One Year Later\" jump, and is an opponent of Wonder Woman in 'The Circle', sporting a generic black costume.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Captain Nazi first appears in the \"Superman\" storyline \"Savage Dawn\" in \"Superman vol. 3 Annual #3\". In 1941, Captain Nazi is a genetically engineered to serve in Hitler's Aerospace program. Vandal Savage successfully convinces the Third Reich to build a rocket that Captain Nazi will use to pilot himself and Vandal Savage into outer space to collect a larger sample of the meteor that gave Savage his powers. When the ship faces turbulence, Captain Nazi opts to land instead of going forward with the mission. After a crash landing, an enraged Vandal Savage beats him until he stops moving.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Captain Nazi is a member of the H.I.V.E. council and represents Germany. He voted for using nuclear weapons to end the war in Western Europe between Aquaman and Wonder Woman. He appears much older here, possibly because he was not placed in suspended animation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066089", "title": "Marlin Firearms", "text": "Marlin Firearms\n\nMarlin Firearms Co. is a manufacturer of semi-automatic, lever-action and bolt-action rifles. In the past, the company made shotguns, derringers and revolvers based in Madison, North Carolina (formerly based in North Haven, Connecticut). Marlin owned the firearm manufacturer H&R Firearms. In 2007, Remington Arms, part of the Remington Outdoor Company, acquired Marlin Firearms. Remington currently produces Marlin-brand firearms at its Kentucky and New York manufacturing facilities.\n\nMarlin Firearms was founded in the 1870s by John Marlin. Marlin produced a large assortment of firearms such as lever-action rifles, pump-action shotguns and single shot rifles. Marlin was considered the main competitor to Winchester.\nIn World War I Marlin became one of the largest machine gun producers in the world for the US and its Allies, building the M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun and a later variant called the \"Marlin gun\" optimized for aircraft use. In 1917 Marlin Rockwell bought out the Hopkins & Allen Arms Company to promote an expanded line of firearms and restore the image of the Marlin company as makers of \"sporting arms\".\n\nMarlin Firearms labored for a century as an underdog levergun maker to Winchester (formerly of New Haven). However, in the 1980s and 1990s, Marlin finally began to outpace its old rival. It is currently the dominant seller of lever-action rifles in North America. Its use of side ejection allows for flat-topped firearms, thereby making the mounting of scopes easier than for traditional Winchesters. This helped Marlin capture more market share as American shooters came to rely more and more on optics. Marlins are larger, stronger and heavier than most of the comparable Winchester line, allowing Marlin to use higher powered cartridges such as the .45-70. Marlin's model 1894 lever-action rifles and carbines are available in handgun calibers, including .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum and .41 Magnum, making them suitable companion long guns for revolvers in those calibers.\n\nMajor models of Marlin rifles include:\n\nSignificant variations of many of these rifles have usually also been manufactured. For example, there are 6 distinctly different variations manufactured for the Marlin Model 60.\nMarlin has been making lever-action rifles since 1881, and in 2008, they produced their 30 millionth lever-action rifle, which was donated to the National Rifle Association.\n\nDouble Barrel Shotguns:\n\nExposed Hammer, Pump-Action Shotguns:\n\nHammerless Pump-Action Shotguns:\n\nSubmachine guns include:\n\nRevolvers include:\n\nIn 1953 Marlin Firearms was issued for what was named MicroGroove Rifling, which was a departure from the standard \"Ballard,\" or cut rifling. One purpose of Microgroove rifling was to increase the speed of producing rifle barrels. Microgroove rifling is described in the patent as having 5 grooves for every 1/10 of an inch bore diameter, and that the driving side of each land would be \"tangentially disposed\" to prevent accumulating fouling in use.\n\nMarlin introduced Microgroove rifling in their .22 rimfire barrels in July 1953, with 16 grooves that were .014\" wide, and nominally .0015\" deep. Ballard rifled barrels have grooves generally in the range of .069–.090\" wide, and .0015–.003\" deep. This change was marketed in the 1954 Marlin catalog, as having numerous advantages that this new form of rifling had, including better accuracy, ease of cleaning, elimination of gas leakage, higher velocities and lower chamber pressures. The catalog also claimed that Microgroove rifling did not distort the bullet jacket as deeply as Ballard rifling hence improving accuracy with jacketed bullets at standard velocity.\n\nDesigned for factory loaded ammunition, Microgroove barrels have a reputation for accuracy problems with centerfire ammunition handloaded with cast lead bullets due to the increased bore diameter generated by the shallow grooves. The use of oversized cast bullets greatly solves this problem, restoring accuracy with cast bullet handloads to levels seen from Ballard rifled barrels. Early Marlin .30-30 microgroove barrels had a twist rate of 1 turn in 10 inches optimized for factory ammunition with jacketed bullets; later Marlin .30-30 microgroove barrels show a twist rate of 1 turn in 10.5 inches which improves accuracy with cartridges loaded to lower velocity than standard.\n\nIn November 2000, Marlin purchased the assets of H&R 1871, Inc., a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of shotguns and rifles (New England Firearms branded), founded in 1871, and now located in Gardner, Massachusetts. Marketing its products under the brand names of Harrington & Richardson and New England Firearms, H&R 1871 claimed to be the largest manufacturer of Single-shot shotguns and rifles in the world.\nIn December 2007 Remington Arms Company purchased Marlin. Remington announced in April 2008 that it would close the Gardner manufacturing plant by the end of 2008 affecting 200 workers. In March 2010, Marlin announced that it would close its North Haven plant, and move the work to Remington plants in Ilion, New York, and Mayfield, Kentucky.\n"}

This accounts\nfor the original name of the village, 'An Creagán', meaning 'the stoney hill'.\n\nDuring Oliver Cromwell's conquest of Connacht in 1650-1652, Sir Charles Coote laid siege to Galey Castle, the seat of the Ó Ceallaigh clan. The Ó Ceallaighs resisted, and for their defiance, they were taken to An Creagán and hanged on the stepped hill just north of the village, now commonly known as Hangman's Hill. The village thereafter came to be known as ‘Cnoc an Chrochaire,’ 'the Hill of the Hanging', now Anglicised as ‘Knockcroghery’.\n\nIn the early hours of 19 June 1921, the Black and Tans set Knockcroghery village alight. It was an act of vengeance for the killing of a British general in Glassan two days previously by the Westmeath Volunteers. British intelligence agents mistakenly believed that the killers had come across Lough Ree from the Galey Bay/Knockcroghery area.\nThe Black and Tans arrived in four lorries and parked at St. Patrick's Church. Reportedly drunk and dressed in civilian clothing, they put masks on their faces, fired shots into the air and ordered the people out of their homes. They easily set fire to the thatched roofs of the cottages, using petrol. They were less successful in setting Murray's, Flanagan's and the presbytery alight, due to their slated roofs.\nHaving no time to take their possessions with them, the people rushed from their houses onto the street, still in their nightshirts.\nCanon Bartholomew Kelly refused to leave his house, until the Black and Tans began dousing his furniture with petrol. He jumped out of his bedroom window onto a shed twelve feet below, and hid himself until they had left. His slate roof saved his house from being totally destroyed.\nUnable to set Murray's roof alight, the Black and Tans set fire to the back door. John Murray reacted quickly to put the fire out, saving the house. The occupants of the thatched houses did not have this opportunity, and their houses burned to the ground very quickly.\nMichael O' Callaghan described the scene: \"the raiding forces drove up and down the village, firing shots at random, cursing loudly, and laughing at the plight of the people of Knockcroghery. The people were terrified, particularly the children, whose cries of fear added to the terrible scene.\"\nThe flames above Knockcroghery alerted the people for miles around to what had happened, and by daylight, the street was full of people. On the evening of the burning, there had been fifteen houses on the main street of Knockcroghery, most of them single-storey thatched cottages. By the following morning, all but four had been burned to the ground.\nJamesie Murray remembered the assistance given to the now homeless people of Knockcroghery: \"They came from all over to help. People brought clothes, and a fund was soon set up. The families who were now homeless were accommodated in the vicinity, many staying with relatives who lived nearby. Farm sheds were converted into temporary dwellings. Canon Kelly and others found temporary accommodation with Knockcroghery's Church of Ireland rector, Canon Humphries. Later, three or four new cottages were built on the Shrah road and given to bachelors, who then took people in.\"\nThe village was rebuilt over the next few years, with help from government grants. The rebuilding provided employment locally, at a time when it was needed.\n\nIn November 1920, an RIC constable named Potter, who was stationed in Kiltoom, was cycling with another constable from Roscommon to Kiltoom. Constable Potter was shot dead on the Athlone side of Knockcroghery railway station. A few days later, while a fair was going on in Knockcroghery, a party of Black and Tans arrived in the village, and in an act of retaliation, rounded up all the men into the handball alley and beat them with bull whips. The Black and Tans seized some tins of paint from a local shop and forced the men to paint over a tricolour that had been painted onto the wall of the handball alley some time previously. They then forced the men to place their hands onto the wet paint and then put their hands into their pockets and wipe them on their clothes.\n\nPrior to the 1870s, what is now the parish of Knockcroghery was two separate parishes: Kilinvoy and Kilmaine. The church in Killinvoy was built around the 1810s, when the Penal Laws were being relaxed. It ceased to be used as a church in 1883 but continues to be used as a community centre to this day, and is known as Culleen Hall. The church in Kilmaine was a very old, small thatched building. After it ceased to be used as a church, it was demolished and is now the site of Ballymurray National School.\n\nIn the early 1870s, the parishes of Killinvoy and Kilmaine were merged into the parish of St Patrick, Knockcroghery. In the mid-1870s, a decision was made to build a new, more centrally-located church. Lord Crofton of Mote Park gave a site on the Southern edge of Knockcroghery for a nominal rent of a shilling per year. Construction work commenced in 1879 and St Patrick's Church was consecrated on 18 October 1885. The cost of construction was £3,000, of which, £1,313 remained outstanding at the time of consecration. Donations were received following an appeal in the sermon at the consecration, which assisted in paying down the debt of the construction. The churches in Culleen and Ballymurray closed down, but many of the parishioners of Ballymurray refused to transfer to Knockcroghery, and continued attending the old Ballymurray church at mass time every Sunday to say the Rosary until it was demolished in 1886.\n\nFor over 250 years the village was famous for the production of the tobacco clay pipe, or \"\"Dúidín\"\". By the late 1800s there were up to 100 people involved in the manufacture and distribution of the village’s clay pipes. Production ceased abruptly on 19 June 1921 when the village was burned down by the Black and Tans during the Irish War of Independence. Today, a visitor centre and workshop are located on the original site of Andrew and P.J. Curley’s pipe factory, where pipes are handcrafted using the original methods of production. The clay-pipe visitors centre is located in the middle of the village and sells clay-pipes and other hand-crafted souvenirs.\n\nUntil the late 20th century, the village contained a number of shops, a butcher's, a chemist, a florist, a petrol station, a post office, four public houses, a railway station and a garda station. With the rise of the private motor car and the associated convenient access to larger towns, many of these businesses and services have closed. Today, there remain three public houses, a post office and a hairdresser's.\n\n\nMuch of the architecture of the village centre dates from the 1920s, when the village was rebuilt after the burning by the Black and Tans. Some buildings, such as the church, the community centre, the parochial house, Murray's and the Widow Pat's, predate this however.\n\nThe village's Anglican church was dismantled in the 1970s, the stone being reused to build a church elsewhere. The site formerly occupied by the Anglican church was subsequently occupied by a petrol station. The former rectory associated with the Anglican church remains standing, opposite the post office.\n\nSt. Patrick's Catholic Church is an example of late nineteenth-century ecclesiastical design. It features a two-stage bell tower with pinnacles and a more recently added copper spire. It was built commencing in 1879, with the church being consecrated on 18 October 1885. In the early 1950s, the tower and spire were completed, the bell was installed and the choir gallery was built. At the same time, repair works were carried out, the church was replastered internally and wiring for electric lighting and heating was installed in anticipation of the arrival of rural electrification. In the meantime, lighting was provided by a petrol-powered generator.\n\nThe carved limestone baptismal font in St Patrick's Church came from the old church in Ballymurray (now the site of Ballymurray National School). It was initially used as a holy water font inside the front door before being moved to its current location beside the altar to be used as a baptismal font. The smaller carved limestone holy water font, which is built into the wall inside the tower door, is believed to have come from the old church in Culleen (now Cullen Hall).\n\nThe stained glass windows on the Eastern side of the church depict the history of the church in Ireland, including the old thatched church in Ballymurray.\n\nKnockcroghery is known by many as the home of Roscommon's famous All-Ireland winning captain Jimmy Murray (5 May 1917 – 23 January 2007). He captained Roscommon to their only two All-Ireland Senior Football title wins in 1943 and 1944. He was also captain in their 1946 final and replay against Kerry. As the 1943 final also went to a replay, he is the only man to have captained a team in five All-Ireland senior football finals. His public house is a well-known landmark and revered by lovers of Gaelic football from all parts of Ireland.\n\nKnockcroghery Fair was a festival held annually, generally on the third weekend of September, until 2013. \n\nThe Galey Bay Regatta, an annual yachting regatta, was held from 1872 until 1913 by the Lords Crofton, who owned a boathouse on Galey Bay of Lough Ree adjoining Galey castle. Many visiting house boats were anchored in the bay during the regatta. The yachts varied from 25-ton cutters to 18-foot spritsail lake boats. The regattas were the idea of Edward Crofton and his brother Alfred. After most of the lands had been sold to the adjoining farmers, the Croftons left the area and the regattas were no more. The Croftons were supported in organising the regattas by enthusiasts who came both from Lough Ree Yacht Club and Lough Derg. Lord Crofton was always the chairman of the organising committee.\n\nPeadar Kearney, writer of The Soldier's Song (Amhrán na bhFiann), also penned the song \"Knockcroghery\", when he was challenged to find a word to rhyme with the village's name. His success in rhyming \"Molly Doherty\" with \"Knockcroghery\" is open to debate. \n\nThe traditional Irish phrase, \"fáilte Uí Cheallaigh\" (an O'Kelly welcome) dates from December 1351 when Uilliam Buí Ó Ceallaigh (the Taoiseach of Uí Mháine, a kingdom that roughly covered what is now East County Galway and South County Roscommon) invited the poets, writers and artists of Ireland to a great feast at his home, Gailey Castle. The feast reportedly lasted for a month. It was during this feast that the famous poet, Gofraidh Fionn Ó Dálaigh, wrote the poem, Filidh Éireann go hAointeach, which remembers the great feast.\n\nKnockcroghery railway station opened on 13 February 1860 and finally closed on 17 June 1963. Roscommon railway station is now the nearest station and is located 10 km from Knockcroghery village. It is on the Westport-Dublin line, also serving indirect routes to Ballina, Galway and Ennis.\n\nKnockcroghery is served by Bus Éireann's Route 21 (Westport-Athlone), with indirect routes to Galway, Dublin and other towns. The village is situated on the main N61 road between Athlone and Roscommon towns, and near the M6 Galway-Dublin motorway.\n\n\n"}

His father fought in the War of 1812 and his grandfather was a captain in New Jersey militia in the American Revolution. His older brother Henry served in the Kansas cavalry during the Civil War. Opdycke was educated in the Hubbard schools. He engaged in various business pursuits in Ohio and California.\n\nOpdycke enlisted immediately following the First Battle of Bull Run and was commissioned a first lieutenant in the 41st Ohio Infantry on August 26, 1861. As a captain, he fought in the Battle of Shiloh. He resigned in September 1862 to help recruit the 125th Ohio Infantry, in which he became the lieutenant colonel on October 1, 1862, and the colonel on January 14, 1863. His regiment earned fame in the defense of Horseshoe Ridge at the Battle of Chickamauga. In command of a demi-brigade, Opdycke's men were some of the first to reach the summit of Missionary Ridge during the Battles for Chattanooga. He fought throughout the Atlanta Campaign with the Army of the Cumberland and was badly wounded at the Battle of Resaca, but he recovered sufficiently to lead an assault in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain.\n\nDuring the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, Opdycke distinguished himself at the Battle of Franklin. As the Confederate troops under Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood approached, his division commander, Brig. Gen. George D. Wagner, ordered Opdycke and the other two brigade commanders to take up hasty defensive positions in front of the Union fortified line. Opdycke challenged this order, argued with Wagner, and marched his men into a reserve position behind the fortifications. When the Confederate assault broke the Union line near the Columbia Pike, Opdycke quickly redeployed his men into line of battle, straddling the road, and they were confronted by masses of fleeing Union soldiers, pursued by Confederates. Opdycke ordered his brigade forward to the works. At the same time, his corps commander, Maj. Gen. David S. Stanley, arrived on the scene. He later wrote, \"I saw Opdycke near the center of his line urging his men forward. I gave the Colonel no orders as I saw him engaged in doing the very thing to save us, to get possession of our line again.\" The counterattack turned the tide and the Union Army achieved an important victory.\n\nOpdycke was honored for his service at Franklin with a brevet appointment to major general of volunteers. He was promoted to a full brigadier general on July 26, 1865.\n\nOpdycke resigned from the army in 1866 and moved to New York City, where he engaged in the dry goods business. He wrote several articles on the war, and was active in veterans affairs. He died in New York at the age of 54 of an accidental gunshot to the abdomen, apparently while he was cleaning the weapon.\n\nHe is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Warren, Ohio.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the home of Douglas Hyde, the first President of Ireland. \nThe nearby French Park Estate was until 1952 the ancestral seat of the French family, Barons de Freyne. The estate was sold to the Irish Land Commission in the 1950s and was dismantled by the mid 1970s. A historic smokehouse is one of the few remaining legacies of this period.\n\nFrenchpark - The Ciarrage groups here were the early lords of Airteach. Mac Donagh is cited as later lords of Airtech. The O'Flanagan here were hereditary stewards to the Kings of Connacht.\n\nDominican Priory of the Holy Cross, Cloonshanville. This was sacked during the Cromwellian campaign of the 1650s. Part of the tower still stands (in a ruined state). The site is still used as the local cemetery.\n\nThe French family, originally from Galway, became the dominant landowners in this part of Roscommon in the late seventeenth century. Dominick French was granted 5000 acres of land in County Roscommon and his son John a further 2000 acres. John's wealth and influence were such that he was nicknamed \"An Tiarna Mor\" (the Great Lord).\n\nIn the 1749 Census of Elphin it was the residence of Arthur French, MP in the Parliament of Ireland who was the eldest son of John \"(An Tiarna Mor)\" and his wife Anne Gore. His son Arthur French (1764-1820) was also an MP who was said to have died \"from excessive fox hunting\". His son, also named Arthur French (1786–1856), became the first Baron de Freyne.\n\nMembers of the French family were buried in the graveyard surrounding the ruins of Frenchpark Priory. At the time of Griffith's Valuation Frenchpark was owned by Rev. John Ffrench, Lord de Freyne and was valued at £60. Later in the 1800s the family converted to Roman Catholicism.\n\nThe ancestral seat of the Barons de Freyne was the French Park Estate, County Roscommon. The manor house, originally built in the mid-17th century before being rebuilt in the Georgian style in the 18th century was demolished after the sale of the estate by the 7th Baron de Freyne to the Irish Land Commission in 1952. The Land Commission removed the roof of the buildings in 1953 and eventually demolished the remaining structures in ca 1975. The present Lord de Freyne lives with his wife and family at Putney in the London Borough of Wandsworth.\n\nA distant cousin of the de Freynes was Charlotte Despard (\"née\" French) (1844–1939), a scion of the French family of High Lake, a British-born, later Irish-based suffragist, novelist and Sinn Féin activist. Despard spent a lot of time at French Park where her father was born. In 1908 she joined with Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and Margaret Cousins to form the Irish Women’s Franchise League. She urged members to boycott the 1911 Census and withhold taxes and provided financial support to workers during the Dublin labour disputes.\n\nIn 1909 Despard met Mahatma Gandhi and was influenced for a time by his theory of passive resistance. She moved to Dublin after World War I and was bitterly critical of her brother, Field Marshal The Viscount French, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1919-21, who, unsurprisingly, tended to ignore her.\n\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, together with Maud Gonne, she formed the Women's Prisoners' Defence League to support Republican prisoners. As a member of Cumann na mBan she opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and was imprisoned by the new Government of the Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War. She is buried in the Republican Plot at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.\n\nThe market house is in the center of Frenchpark, on the main street and is very old. The market house was a place where people went to sell their cattle and farm produce (vegetables, potatoes and oats). On market day, which was always on a Thursday, they would trade, buy and sell. There was a large weighing scales outside the building. Unsold goods were stored in the building. The first electricity was generated for Frenchpark from this building. A film was made in the market house about 'The Hanging of Robert Emmett'. The building is now empty and is surrounded by high railings.\n\n"}

A free, limited version is available for online play at many sites or the full version with no time restrictions can be purchased online.\nThe goal of Lemonade Tycoon is to sell lemonade for profit. The last update (1.1.9) was renamed \"Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe\". In 2009, Electronic Arts published an iPhone version of \"Lemonade Tycoon\". \"Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition\" is also available on Mac OS X, published by MacPlay.\n\nWhile selling lemonade, players must look over many aspects of their business. Players decide on a recipe, set prices, and sell lemonade in a variety of locations. The game includes changing weather and news, which the player must compensate for. To overcome some factors, such as long lines and stock, players can buy upgrades. The packaged version included versions for PC, Mobile Phones, Windows Mobile Professional devices, and Palm devices. The game allows players to transfer game saves from a Windows PC to a Palm handheld or Windows Mobile Professional device and back again to continue.\n\n\"Lemonade Tycoon\" has similarities to \"Lemonade Stand\", a computer game originally created for the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium in 1973 and later ported by Apple Computer for use with its then-new Apple II platform in 1979. The game also required players to make businesses decisions based upon weather, customers, and cost/availability of stock.\n\n\"Lemonade Tycoon\" includes three game modes; Career, Challenge and Champion. Career mode lets the player have a stand for as long as they want. Challenge mode had a 30-day limit to see how fast your stand can grow within the period of time.\n\nIn order to be able to sell lemonade, players have to buy supplies, which include ice, lemons, sugar, and cups.\n\nThe player has the option to advertise in \"Lemonade Tycoon\". Every day, the player can pay an advertising fee with different choices in advertising being available. Advertising increases the number of potential customers.\n\nLemonade Tycoon features many upgrades that are available at different prices. Some reduce wait times, some improve visibility, some make ice, etc. Stand upgrades allow more storage and customer capacity. There are also employees, a cashier, and a clown, which charge daily for reducing wait times and increasing patience, respectively.\n\nThere are five different locations where one can move your stand. Some places are more popular than others. Each location has a different rent. Each location has satisfaction and popularity. Popularity changes as the player's stand gets more popular. Good satisfaction and advertising bring more customers. Satisfaction ensures that customers will come back to the stand. If there are short lines, there are good prices, the player serves all customers rather than them leaving, and the player has a good recipe, the player's customer satisfaction will go up. With the increase of satisfaction, customers will come back to a player's stand. Satisfaction and popularity are location based. They do not travel with you as you move from location to location.\n\nThere are many News Headlines that affect the success of lemonade sales. Some headlines improve the player's business and some hurt it. Headlines change every game day and sometimes only affect a single location. Weather also affects sales - warm and hot days bring more customers than cold, rainy days. The weather changes each day and does not seem to follow predictable patterns.\n\nThe Lemonade Stock Exchange was an online feature that let one see how one's stand compared to others.\n\n\nLearning Planet, an educational website, created the original version of the game for teaching economics and resource management for its students. The LearningPlanet.com version of Lemonade Tycoon is visually different but functionally identical to the other iterations of the game.\n"}
{"id": "2066119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066119", "title": "Equitable servitude", "text": "Equitable servitude\n\nAn equitable servitude is a term used in the law of real property to describe a nonpossessory interest in land that operates much like a covenant running with the land. In England and Wales the term is defunct and in Scotland it has very long been a sub-type of the Scottish legal version of servitudes, which are what English law calls easements. However covenants and equitable servitudes in most of the jurisdictions across North America, are slightly different. The usual distinction is based on the remedy plaintiff seeks and precedent will allow for the scenario in question. Where the terms are unmerged, holders of a \"covenant\" seek \"money\" damages; holders of \"equitable servitudes\" seek \"injunctions\". The term used to exist in England widely before \"Tulk v Moxhay\" and as byproduct of the Judicature Acts became one of the fullest mergers of equity and common law in England and Wales so as to agree initially on the term \"equitable covenant\", then coming to be united in the term \"covenant\" save that \"equitable\" bears a particular meaning in English property rights since at least 1925: it means not fully compliant with registration/written formalities. If lacks legally routine formalities it is not a full legal covenant and therefore more tenuous, often only enforceable personally and against the original covenantor (\"in personam\").\n\nEquitable servitude remains conceptually unaltered from its original core meaning however in many derived jurisdictions today. It describes wherever a party is in a non-criminal way forbidden from certain use (of land) in such a way as for breach to justify prohibitory or mandatory action to be ordered by the court. The term usually applies only to permanent restrictions, others may more commonly branded rules, terms of use, private byelaws or restrictions.\n\nThe first example was wherever there was an enclave, the land owner would forever, while it is necessary, enjoy an implied positive servitude over the intervening land. In England and Wales that scenario is almost exclusively expressed in terms of implied easements in modern parlance.\n\nIn the United States, negative and affirmative equitable servitudes remain a live legal concept in their own right. It is a covenant that equity will enforce in equity, rather than in the common law, against the successors of the burdened land who have notice of the covenant. If such notice is by constructive knowledge, such as the enquiries an ordinary purchaser ought to have made, then the covenant is known as \"implied\".\n\nAn equitable servitude must be created by a writing, unless it is a negative equitable servitude that may be implied from a common scheme for the development of a residential subdivision, so long as landowners have notice of the agreement. Implied negative servitudes, however, are not recognized in some states, such as Massachusetts and California.\n\nA successor of the promisor is bound if the original promise is in writing, the covenanting parties intended the servitude to be enforceable by and against assignees, the successor of the promisor has actual, inquiry (record), or constructive notice of the servitude, and the covenant touches and concerns the land.\n\nThe benefit of an equitable servitude runs with the land and thus is enforceable by the promisee's successors if the original parties so intended, and the servitude touches and concerns the benefited property.\n\nA court will not enforce an equitable servitude under the following circumstances:\n\n"}
{"id": "2066122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066122", "title": "Lieutenant Marvels", "text": "Lieutenant Marvels\n\nThe Lieutenant Marvels are fictional characters, a team of superheroes in the Fawcett Comics and DC Comics universes. They first appeared in \"Whiz Comics\" #21 in 1941. The physical appearance of the three characters was based on three real-life members of the Fawcett Comics staff: Paul Peck (Tall Billy), Ed Hamilton (Hill Billy), and Frank Taggart (Fat Billy).\n\nThe Lieutenants appeared periodically in the adventures of Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family through the early 1950s, and also when the characters were revived by DC Comics in the 1970s under the title \"Shazam!\", although rarely. They were retconned out of existence during the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" in 1985. Some people, such as Jonathan Woodward in his \"Annotated Crisis on Infinite Earths\" website, suggest that the Lieutenant Marvels died in the last battle of the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", although \"Who's Who in the DC Universe\" claims they survived but lost their powers.\n\nThe characters were reintroduced in \"Trials of Shazam!\" #2 (2006), only to lose their powers in the same issue. They also appeared as inhabitants of Earth-5 in Grant Morrison's \"The Multiversity\" miniseries in 2015.\n\nBrooklyn, New York City, has its own Billy Batson, and he travels to the W.H.I.Z. radio station with two other Billy Batsons, one from the Western United States and one from the Southern United States, to visit the \"real\" Billy. To prevent confusion, the western Billy suggests he be called \"Tall\" Billy, the southern Billy is renamed \"Hill\" Billy and Brooklyn's Billy is given the title \"Fat\" Billy. At the \"real\" Billy's suggestion, all four Billys form the Billy Batson Club. Billy reveals he is Captain Marvel to them, and says they should only say \"Shazam!\" when he gives them a wink.\n\nThe nefarious Dr. Sivana hatches a plan to kill the \"real\" Billy Batson and sends his three henchmen to find out where Billy lives. Sivana's goons mistakenly find the other Billy Batsons instead and capture them. The mysterious Captain Death captures Tall Billy, Nazi Agent Herr Geyer captures Fat Billy, and bandit \"Biggy\" Brix captures Hill Billy. Sivana uses them as bait to trap the real Billy after hearing he is their friend, having Brix deliver a note, and demanding he comes to the Mill as Billy. When this happens he is knocked out and captured.\n\nSivana and his henchmen gag Billy and tie him and the other Billys to a log heading towards a buzzsaw, then leave. Billy is able to remove his gag on the buzzsaw, but his shout of \"Shazam\" can not be heard over the roar of the buzzsaw. With seconds to spare, Billy enlists the aid of his club members and they all shout \"Shazam!\" together.\n\nWhen the smoke clears, Captain Marvel sees that the other Billys have transformed as well, into Tall Marvel, Hill Marvel, and Fat Marvel. Hill Marvel remarks that they have each changed into Captain Marvel but Fat Marvel counters that by saying that there is only one Captain Marvel. Tall Marvel suggests that they are really Lieutenant Marvels, hence the trio's name.\n\nThe Captain and his three Lieutenants easily defeat Sivana and his henchmen, knocking their plane down and apparently killing all the villains except Sivana. After shouting \"Shazam!\" and transforming back into their civilian identities, the three Billys head back home. The Lieutenants returned from time to time during the Fawcett Comics era to aid their hero. In \"Captain Marvel Adventures\" #4 they are again kidnapped by Sivana's henchmen. Captain Marvel follows the kidnappers to Sivana's base. The three Billys are tied up under three sharp pendulums. However Billy transforms with them and they defeat the henchmen. They hear a noise in a shed, and find Sivana's daughter Beautia bound and gagged inside. They release her and she reveals Sivana did this. They fly away before Sivana detonates tons of dynamite under the house, then defeat him. They were probably put in suspended animation until 1973, along with many Marvel characters, by the Sivanas. They make their first DC appearance in \"Shazam!\" #30, when the whole Marvel Family is called upon to destroy Sivana's steel menagerie, which is threatening to wreck Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Lieutenant Marvels exist, without powers though still helping the Marvel Family to fight crime, on Earth-5, as seen in \"The Multiversity\" miniseries by writer Grant Morrison.\n\nBy shouting \"Shazam!\", the three Billy Batsons are transformed into the Lieutenant Marvels. In this form, they each have the powers of Captain Marvel: the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury. Since they have to share the power, they are each only one-third as powerful as Captain Marvel.\n\nIn the direct-to-video animated film \"\", three superpowered henchmen with powers similar to the Marvels are employed by Superwoman, a criminal, parallel universe incarnation of Wonder Woman, and referred to as her Lieutenants. However, instead of the \"classic\" Lieutenant Marvels, the trio appear as criminal counterparts of Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Uncle Marvel (listed in the film's credits as, respectively, \"Captain Super\", \"Captain Super Jr.\", and \"Uncle Super\").\n\nIn the TV series \"Young Justice\", Mary Batson and Freddy Freeman as Lieutenant Marvel and Sergeant Marvel joined the team during the five year jump but did not appear in the second season leaving the characters' fate unknown.\n\n"}
