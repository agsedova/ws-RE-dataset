{"id": "2205512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205512", "title": "Majorat", "text": "Majorat\n\nMajorat () is a French term for an arrangement giving the right of succession to a specific parcel of property associated with a title of nobility to a single heir, based on male primogeniture. A majorat (fideicommis) would be inherited by the oldest son, or if there was no son, the nearest relative. This law existed in some European countries and was designed to prevent the distribution of wealthy estates between many members of the family, thus weakening their position. Majorats were one of the factors easing the evolution of aristocracy. The term is not used of English inheritances, where the concept was actually the norm, in the form of entails or fee tails. Majorats were specifically regulated by French law. In France, it was a title of property, landed or funded, attached to a title instituted by Napoleon I and abolished 1848. \n\nOften the title could not be inherited if the property did not pass to the same person. Like English entails, the implications of majorats were often used in fiction to furnish complexity in plots; Honoré de Balzac was especially interested in them.\n\nIn the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, majorat was known as \"ordynacja\" and was introduced in late 16th century by king Stephen Báthory. A couple of Polish magnates' fortunes were based on \"ordynacja\", namely those of the Radziwiłłs, Zamoyskis, Wielopolskis. was abolished by the agricultural reform in the People's Republic of Poland.\n\nIn Portugal a similar construct was called a , the holder of which was denominated the \"morgado\" ou \"morgada\" if female\".\" Each \"morgadio\" was established by specific deed on the basis of an indivisible estate and included rules of succession. In many cases, one of the requirements for inheritance was to pass down the family name of the founder of the \"morgadio\" and, occasionally, his or her coat of arms. Both men and women could institute and inherit, although in most cases succession was preferentially by male primogeniture. In some families many \"morgadios\" were accumulated as a result of marriage alliances, leading to a tradition of very long family names among the Portuguese nobility. \"Morgadios\" were abolished in 1863.\n\nIn Spain it was known as , and become a part of the Castilian law since 1505 () until 1820. Basque majorats could be inherited by the oldest male or female child.\n\n"}

It is found from near the surface to depths of at reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific region, with the exception of the Persian Gulf. It also enters estuaries, such as the lowermost part of the Brisbane River. It reaches up to in length and in weight. Giant groupers feed on a variety of marine life, including small sharks and juvenile sea turtles. Due to overfishing, this species has declined drastically in many regions, and as of the mid-1990s, it is considered Data Deficient by the IUCN.\nThis giant fish is similar to the Malabar grouper, and its colour changes with age. The giant grouper has a large mouth and a rounded tail. Juveniles have irregular black and yellow markings, while adults are green-grey to grey-brown with faint mottling, with numerous small black spots on the fins.\n\nThe first fish to undergo chemotherapy was Bubba, a giant grouper at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.\n\nLike most groupers, giant groupers are protogynous hermaphrodites (all are born female, but some become male when few males are present). They spawn on a lunar cycle, with spawns lasting about 7 days. They are aggregative broadcast spawners, usually with several females per male. Studies in captive populations suggest that the dominant male and female begin the spawning event as nearly the only spawners for the first day or two, but other members of the aggregation fertilize more eggs as the event progresses, with even the most recently turned males fathering offspring. Unlike males, where one male is dominant across spawns, the dominant female of an aggregation seems to change from month to month.\n\n"}

{"id": "2205564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205564", "title": "Lewis Wolpert", "text": "Lewis Wolpert\n\nLewis Wolpert (born 19 October 1929) is a South African-born British developmental biologist, author, and broadcaster. Wolpert is recognized for his work on the intracellular positional information that guides cellular development. In addition, he has published several popular science books.\n\nWolpert was born into a South African Jewish family of Lithuanian Jewish origin. He was educated at the University of Witwatersrand (BSc), at Imperial College London, and at King's College London (PhD). he holds the position of Emeritus Professor of Biology as applied to Medicine in the Department of Anatomy and developmental biology at University College London.\n\nBiologists recognise Wolpert for elaborating and championing the ideas of positional information and positional value: molecular signals and internal cellular responses to them that enable cells to do the right thing in the right place during embryonic development. The essence of these concepts is that there is a dedicated set of molecules for spatial co-ordination of cells, identical across many species and across different developmental stages and tissues. The discovery of Hox gene codes in flies and vertebrates has largely vindicated Wolpert's positional-value concept, while identification of growth-factor morphogens in many species has supported the concept of positional information.\n\nIn addition to his scientific and research publications, he has written about his own experience of clinical depression in \"Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression\" (1999). He presented three television programmes based on the book and entitled \"A Living Hell\" on BBC2. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1980 and awarded the CBE in 1990. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999 and one of the first Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 1998. He serves as a Vice-President of Humanists UK. In 1986 Wolpert was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on \"Frankenstein's Quest: Development of Life\". In 2018 he received the Royal Medal. \n\nIn a 2005 article entitled \"Spiked\", \"The Guardian\" asked a series of scientists \"What is the one thing everyone should learn about science?\" Wolpert responded:\nI would teach the world that science is the best way to understand the world, and that for any set of observations, there is only one correct explanation. Also, science is value-free, as it explains the world as it is. Ethical issues arise only when science is applied to technology – from medicine to industry.\nOf his book \"How We Live & Why We Die: The Secret Lives of Cells\", Wolpert said the intended audience of his book was the general public. He said he thought the general public needed to understand that people are a society of cells, particularly if they wanted to understand humans.\n\nWolpert also believes that one very important and so far unsolved question in cellular research is the origins and evolution of the first cell, as well as the question of cell behavior, which in his opinion would be useful for the study of illnesses such as cancer or Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWolpert has debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig about the existence of God, Christian astrophysicist Hugh Ross on whether there is a case for a creator, and William Dembski on the topic of intelligent design. In a lecture entitled \"Is Science Dangerous?\", he expanded on this: \"I regard it as ethically unacceptable and impractical to censor any aspect of trying to understand the nature of our world.\"\n\nOn 25 May 1994, Wolpert conducted an hour-long interview with Francis Crick called \"How the Brain 'sees'\" for \"The Times\" Dillon Science Forum; Just Results Video Productions produced a video of the interview for \"The Times\". On 15 January 2004, Wolpert and biologist/parapsychologist Rupert Sheldrake engaged in a live debate regarding the evidence for telepathy. It took place at the Royal Society of Arts in London. Wolpert also disagreed with Sheldrake regarding the possibility of putting a cell or an embryo onto a computer, which Wolpert believed would be attainable within the following 20 years. He believes doing so would predict in detail how the cell will behave, although he also admits to the difficulty of this task due to the complex networks of proteins, protein-to-protein interactions, and the vast amount of molecules in the cell.\n\nIn the late 1960s Wolpert proposed the illustrative French flag model, which explains how signalling between cells early in morphogenesis could be used to inform cells with the same genetic regulatory network of their position and role.\n\nHe is credited with the famous quote: \"It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation which is truly the most important time in your life.\"\n\nWolpert has said he is against human cloning because \"the child would almost certainly be ill or be abnormal\".\n\nHe is an atheist and a lifelong friend of the fellow South African and author Jillian Becker, editor of the \"Atheist Conservative\".\n\nWolpert has published a number of popular science books, including \"The Unnatural Nature of Science\", \"Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast: The Evolutionary Origins of Belief\", and \"How We Live And Why We Die: The Secret Lives of Cells\".\n\nIn 2011, Wolpert published \"You're Looking Very Well\", a book on the social and scientific aspects of aging. The book was withdrawn from sale by its publisher in 2014 after being found to contain numerous passages copied without attribution from the scientific literature and from various websites, including Wikipedia. Publication of Wolpert's upcoming book, \"Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man?\", was also delayed after passages of that book were found to be copied without attribution. Wolpert apologized and took responsibility for the errors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2205573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205573", "title": "Firefox Down", "text": "Firefox Down\n\nFirefox Down is a 1983 novel by author Craig Thomas. It is a sequel to his novel \"Firefox\". Craig Thomas dedicated the first edition of the novel to actor/director/producer Clint Eastwood, who starred as Mitchell Gant in the film adaptation of the first novel, stating, \"For Clint Eastwood — pilot of the Firefox\".\n\nAs with the first novel, the book focuses on the efforts of Mitchell Gant to steal the fictional prototype MiG-31 Firefox Soviet aircraft. At the climax of \"Firefox\", Gant engaged in combat with a second MiG-31; the second novel begins mere moments later, with Gant discovering that his aircraft sustained damage in the dogfight and is losing fuel rapidly. After a brief engagement with two Soviet MiG-25s, Gant lands the Firefox on a frozen Finnish lake, whereupon the weight of the aircraft causes it to break through the ice and become submerged.\n\nUpon fleeing the lake, Gant is captured by the KGB and taken back to the Soviet Union. The West must then mount a desperate attempt to recover the Firefox from the lake, repair it, and return it to flyable condition before Soviet forces can recapture or destroy it. At the same time, Gant attempts to escape the Soviet Union. Dmitri Priabin (a KGB officer with a minor role in \"Firefox\") has an expanded role in its sequel; his lover has been working for the Americans under the codename \"Burgoyne\", forcing Priabin to choose between recapturing Gant and saving the woman.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, \"Firefox Down\" did not become a feature film. The book, however, depicts the MiG-31 from the movie on the cover and the text of the novel describes it as black, as it was in the movie, rather than the original silver.\n\nAside from being an immediate sequel to \"Firefox\", \"Firefox Down\" fits within the larger fictional universe of the Craig Thomas novels.\n\nMitchell Gant continues his appearances in the novels \"Winter Hawk\" (1987) \"Firefox Orbital\" (1989) and \"A Different War\" (1997). The characters Colonel Kontarsky, Vasilly, General Vladimirov, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) First Secretary, and Kenneth Aubrey return from \"Firefox\". Yuri Andropov, who was the Chairman of the KGB in \"Firefox\" (first published in 1975) retains this role, even though by the time the sequel was published, he had already become the General Secretary of the CPSU, as explained in a prefatory note inserted by the author. Dmitri Priabin reappears in later books as well, though mostly by reference. As with Gant, Priabin has a major role as an antagonist/protagonist in \"Winter Hawk\", largely based on a personal vendetta against Gant due to the events of \"Firefox Down\". Alan Waterford features as well in \"Snow Falcon\", and CIA Deputy Director Charles Buckholz appears in several other novels.\n"}

He consolidated his fame with appearances on discussion programmes such as \"Any Questions?\" and panel games such as \"Ask Me Another\", and was a household name by the mid-1960s.

{"id": "2205596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205596", "title": "Cranhill", "text": "Cranhill\n\nCranhill is an inner city district and housing scheme in the north east of Glasgow, Scotland. Cranhill was developed from public funding in the early 1950s and was originally, chiefly composed of four-storey tenement blocks surrounding a patch of grassland, which became Cranhill Park. Later development saw the building of three tower blocks (locally, \"high-flats\"), surrounded by rows of terraced maisonettes. In more recent years, a number of semi-detached and detached homes have been built. The area also hosts some shops, two primary schools and nurseries, a community centre and the Cranhill water tower.\n\nCranhill was built in the early 1950s on the eastern outskirts of the city to alleviate the post-war housing shortage, like other similar publicly funded housing estates. Unlike the much larger housing schemes of Castlemilk, Drumchapel, Easterhouse and Pollok, Cranhill was relatively compact, yet still dense, due to the large number of tenements, maisonettes and tower blocks. These maisonettes were demolished in the late 1990s.\n\nCranhill is compactly located in the north east of the city with High Carntyne to the west (separated by Ruchazie Road), Springboig and Carntyne to the south (separated by the A8 Edinburgh Road), Queenslie to the east (separated by Stepps Road) and Ruchazie to the north (separated by the Monkland Canal, now the M8 motorway). Most of the streets are named after Scottish lighthouses and include Crowlin Crescent, Gantock Crescent, Lamlash Crescent, Monach Road, Skerryvore Road, Startpoint Street, Strone Road and Toward Road. Longstone Road is an exception, Longstone being located in the Farne Islands off the coast of England. The main street, running east–west through the entire estate, is Bellrock Street.\n\nThe housing stock consisted mostly of four-storey tenement blocks divided into common 'closes', each with eight flats with the end close in each street called a \"T\" close with 4 flats. The gap between two adjacent \"T-closes\" was known as a 'gable-end', which in essence was simply a gap between two buildings and normally led to a communal area to the back of the buildings and was the common location for storing rubbish bins. Other types included three tower blocks, locally known as 'the multis' or the 'high flats', a number of terraced maisonettes and a variety of pseudo sandstone (concrete blocks) four-in-a-block cottage flats.\n\nMost of the flats were typical family accommodation of the time, containing a kitchen, bathroom/toilet, two or three bedrooms and a living room. Many of them had balconies or verandas overlooking the street and all were a vast improvement on living conditions in the old Glasgow slum tenements. For many of the families who moved in, this was their first access to green fields and nearby farms, and the playing areas were paradise compared to the rat-infested back-courts which the children had formerly suffered. Nevertheless, a favourite play area was the 'Sugarolly Mountains', substantial hills made from chemical tailings dumped by the side of the canal on the site now occupied by the high flats (and featured in the lyrics of Jim Diamond). No-one knew what they were made of, but the rainwater puddles were green! Even the canal itself was an attraction, given that the next-nearest 'recreational' water was either at Alexandra Park or Hogganfield Loch.\n\nAs the scheme became established and the community grew, amenities were put in place. Bus routes were extended through the scheme to make it easier for people to travel for work or pleasure, to the City Centre or the nearby shopping areas of Shettleston and Dennistoun. Other basic needs were served with the establishment of three local shopping parades.\n\nAs well as the shops, local people were served by mobile street traders with vans and lorries selling foodstuffs, coal and paraffin oil, sweets and soft drinks, ice cream and even fish and chips. In the evenings one could hear the cry of Dalzeil's Bakeries van man shouting \"roells!\" (bread rolls). Candy apples and 'whelks' (actually periwinkles) could be obtained while rag-merchants would shout 'any old rags' or 'Delft (crockery) for rags' from horsedrawn or hand carts. Today, the only surviving mobile service is the 'ice cream van'.\n\nThe first primary schools to be erected were small metal constructions but, at its peak, Cranhill had five primary schools: Lamlash, St Giles RC (the tin part of which was originally used as an annexe of Cranhill Sec), St Elizabeth Seton RC (originally St Modans RC Annex), the larger brick-built Milncroft (including the Toward Rd annex) and St Modans RC. Milncroft was demolished in 2006 and St Modans RC in March 2007. All five original primary schools are now closed and demolished. The two original nursery schools, Bellrock Nursery and Lamlash Nursery, are now also closed. Two new primary schools, Cranhill Primary and St Maria Goretti's RC Primary, were built in 2005/2006, the former on the site of the demolished Milncroft. Lamlash nursery school is now located within St Maria Goretti's Primary school and Bellrock nursery school is located within Cranhill Primary School.\n\nAs the children grew older, local secondary schools were needed, the first being Lightburn Secondary across the Edinburgh Rd in Torphin Crescent, Greenfield. With the construction of Cranhill Secondary in Startpoint St, the Torphin Crescent building became St Gregory's RC Secondary to meet the needs of the Roman Catholic population. Some time later, a new St Gregory's was built on waste land at Crowlin Cres in Cranhill and the Torphin Crescent was renamed again, as St Andrews RC Secondary. At its peak, Cranhill Secondary had a roll of some 1300, but both secondaries in Cranhill were razed in the early 1990s and replaced by private housing estates.\n\nTwo churches were built: Cranhill (Church of Scotland) Parish Church and St Maria Goretti's RC Chapel. There were two Boy Scout troops, the 68th Glasgow and the 158th Glasgow, a Boys' Brigade troop, the 150th, and a Girls' Brigade company, the 63rd. The Tenants' Association hall provided an early focus for social events and a Community Centre was opened around 1980.\n\nCranhill Park was built in the centre of the scheme and became the heart (and lungs) of the community. It featured an 18-hole pitch-and-putt course (famous for its sloping terrain), tennis courts and a bowling green. An annual carnival was held, with a visiting fairground and food outlets. A favourite amongst local children was free miniature loaves of bread distributed by a local bakery. The carnival, however, was stopped in the mid-1980s due to ignored safety regulations which led to some serious accidents, including a near fatal head injury of a 3-year-old child.\n\nThe Cranhill Credit Union was set up by John Kerr, Ellen Kerr, Helen Kane MBE and other committed members of the community in the late 1970s. This was modelled on Scotland's first credit union, the Western Credit Union (now Drumchapel Credit Union) established by Bert Mullen in 1970.\n\nThe Cranhill Arts Project, possibly better known to more non-residents than to locals, goes from strength to strength, but the most famous local landmark is the Cranhill Water Tower, at the corner of Stepps Rd and Bellrock St. One of several huge elevated storage tanks built to provide high-volume, high-pressure storage, Cranhill Water Tower is unique in having a square concrete tank, in contrast to its cylindrical neighbours in Garthamlock and elsewhere. At night, the structure was illuminated a vibrant green with white spotlights shining from the base of the tank down to the ground. Several wire sculptures of sirens by Andy Scott have been placed around the base of the tower.\n\nCranhill has produced its share of celebrities including actor Billy Boyd of The Lord of the Rings, footballers Jim and Joe Smith of Newcastle, Aberdeen and Scotland, Kenny Aird of St Johnstone and comedy actor Gerard Kelly. Possibly the most famous former residents are Angus Young and brother Malcolm who found stardom after they moved to Australia and formed AC/DC. George Young, Angus and Malcolm's older brother, also found fame with the 60s group Easybeats. Pat Nevin, soccer pundit and former Scotland player, attended Saint Gregory's Secondary School which later became Saint Andrew's Secondary school. Politician Adam Ingram lived in Skerryvore Road at the bottom of the lane and Glasgow Boy artist Adrian Wiszniewski was also a Cranhill resident.\nJunior Campbell from the sixties band The Marmalade and who also wrote the music for Thomas the Tank Engine lived in nearby Springboig, but ran his schoolboy \"paper round\" from the Glasgow Evening Times/Citizen van drop at the infamous Cranhill Water Tower. Archy Kirkwood (Sir Archibald Johnstone Kirkwood, Baron Kirkwood of Kirkhope) long-standing Liberal Democrat MP, then knighted, then elevated to the House of Lords lived and was educated in Cranhill. He played in a pop group (The Aztecs) in the same locations and at the same time as The Gaylords (early Marmalade) at two nearby Springboig venues; both groups could hear each other playing next door, alternating Saturdays at the YMCA and the \"Shack\". Kirkwood lived in Crowlin Crescent.\n\nMost of the original housing stock has been demolished to make way for 'back-and-front-door' houses and a private housing scheme and supermarket now occupy the site of the former Cranhill Secondary School.

He was one of the China Hands, whose careers in the Foreign Service were ended by McCarthyism and the reaction to the loss of China.\n\nDavies was born in Sichuan, China, the son of Baptist missionaries John Paton and Helen Elizabeth (MacNeil) Davies Sr. His grandfather was Welsh immigrant and Cleveland drygoods merchant Caleb Davies. He spent two years at the Experimental College at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, one year at Yenching University, then graduated from Columbia University in 1931. He joined the Foreign Service upon graduation, and was posted to China in 1933.\n\nDuring World War II, Davies was assigned as political attaché to General Joseph Stilwell. He began the assignment in February 1942, arriving in the China Burma India Theater (CBI) in March, based mainly in Assam, India and Kunming, China. Upon a short return to Washington, D.C., he married Patricia Louise Grady on August 24, 1942, before returning to India. He served under Stilwell until the general's recall from China in the fall of 1944. Davies was instrumental in the creation of the U.S. Army Observation Group to Yan'an, China, in 1944.\n\nThe group, commonly known as the Dixie Mission, established the first official diplomatic and military contact between the United States and the Chinese Communists. Many of its members later became victims of McCarthyism. Davies saw the mission as means to prevent, or at least decrease, Soviet influence over the Chinese Communists. As time progressed, Davies also saw the Communists as a realistic alternative to the Kuomintang.\n\nAfter General Stilwell's recall, Davies served briefly under General Albert Coady Wedemeyer, and also General Patrick J. Hurley. The last three months of 1944 were to prove his last in China, as Davies found himself increasingly at odds with Hurley, who was appointed acting ambassador to China in mid-November. The main point of contention between the two men was their views on the future of China. Hurley advocated for a unified government of Communists and Nationalists with the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at its head. Davies, meanwhile, believed that not only was a coalition impossible to form, but that Chiang's regime was ultimately a dead end for American policy in China. Further, Davies believed that the Communists were the future of China.\n\nDavies visited Yan'an, China, twice. The second trip, in mid-December, resulted in an intense argument with Hurley over Davies' motives. Hurley accused Davies of actively working to undermine Hurley's unification talks between the CCP and the KMT. At this time, Hurley undertook work to finalize Davies' transfer out of China to Moscow. A second argument in the first week of January, resulted in Hurley threatening to destroy Davies' career and accusing the Foreign Service Officer of being a Communist. Davies departed China for good on January 9, 1945.\n\nDavies and several others, including Eric Sevareid and a Chinese general, were flying from Assam in India to Chongqing in 1943 when the plane developed engine trouble and the occupants were forced to bail out over the Burmese jungle, in an area inhabited by the Naga headhunters. Davies led all the passengers to safety and, in 1948, was awarded the Medal of Freedom.\n\nAfter the war, he served as first secretary in charge of the political section at the United States embassy in Moscow; on the State Department's policy staff; with the High Commission for Germany; as director of political affairs at the German Embassy; and finally, as counselor and chargé d'affaires at the Peruvian Embassy, until his dismissal in 1954.\n\nDavies was one of the China Hands who specialized in China and the Far East in the State Department. He predicted that Mao Zedong's Communists would win the Chinese Civil War, and, after they did so in 1949, he advocated US relations with Communist China to forestall a Soviet takeover. These views ran counter to prevailing government policy and provoked the \"China lobby\". Supporters of Chiang Kai-shek were looking for those who had helped \"lose\" China and Senator Joseph McCarthy was looking for any Communists in government. Davies was attacked as both.\n\nNine investigations of Davies' loyalty between 1948 and 1954 did not produce evidence of disloyalty or Communist sympathies. His opposition to Communism was a matter of record; indeed, in 1950 he had advocated a preventive nuclear showdown with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, in 1954, under political pressure from McCarthy and Senator Patrick McCarran, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles asked Davies to resign. He refused, and on November 5, 1954, Dulles fired him, claiming he had \"demonstrated a lack of judgment, discretion and reliability.\"\n\nAfter the end of his diplomatic career, Davies returned to Peru and, with his wife, operated a furniture business. Their company, Estilo, won the International Design Award twice. The Davies family returned to the United States in 1964. After a protracted battle, Davies was finally exonerated and regained his government clearance in 1969. The family moved to Málaga, Spain in 1972, to France and England, and finally back to the US.\n\nDavies died December 23, 1999, in Asheville, North Carolina, at the age of 91.\n\n\n"}

It is the naval arm of the State of Ohio's Adjutant General's Department, and is part of Ohio's State Defense Forces.\n\nTheir operational headquarters are on the Camp Perry Joint Training Center, in Port Clinton, Ohio, on the shores of Lake Erie.\n\nMembers, who range from 17–67 years old, typically drill one weekend a month and one week in the summer. From the months of April, through November, the drills consist primarily of patrolling the impact area of Lake Erie immediately adjacent to Camp Perry's firing range.\n\nOn March 1, 1896, an act was passed by the Ohio General Assembly providing for the organization of two battalions to be known as the Naval Brigade of the National Guard of Ohio. Without funds for outfitting or maintenance, they mustered in Toledo in July and through further organization, one battalion was located in Cleveland and one in Toledo.\n\nIn 1898, the United States Congress declared war against Spain. In an effort to get Spain out of Cuba, President William McKinley was authorized to use all land and naval forces, as well as militia to enforce Congressional demands. At this time, the naval forces in the State of Ohio became the Ohio Naval Militia (ONM). The Ohio Naval Militia participated in the war, fighting as part of the 10th Ohio Volunteer Infantry.\n\nThe ONM later purchased the old revenue cutter \"Andrew Johnson\", which was refitted accordingly. The U.S. Navy also assigned the to train naval militias on the Great Lakes. The first training was at Johnson's Island in Sandusky Bay in July 1897.\n\nOn 20 April 1917 the ship's company of at Cleveland, part of the ONM, was the first Ohio National Guard unit activated for service in the First World War \n\nIn 1936, a new Naval Militia Armory, located in Bayview Park in Toledo and built by the WPA was dedicated. It served the needs of the ONM until 1947 when it was taken over by the newly formed U.S. Naval Reserve.\n\nThe ONM was deactivated following World War II, and remained so for nearly 30 years. In 1974, the former lieutenant governor, John W. Brown began the process of reactivating the Ohio Naval Militia; and on November 1, 1977 the ONM was reactivated with John W. Brown as the first commandant.\n\nThe ONM assists in natural disasters or other emergencies, as called upon by the governor or the Adjutant General.\n\nTheir active mission is to patrol the government impact area off Camp Perry, in the waters of Lake Erie. It is a live-fire area that requires keeping pleasure boaters and fishermen from entering. By patrolling the impact area, the ONM provides support for the Ohio National Guard and other state and federal military units as they perform weapons qualifications prior to deploying.\n\nBy conducting continuous training on their boats and in the classroom, members have the opportunity to become coxswains (boat operators) and boat crew. ONM members also receive basic boating education training to prepare for certification by the Ohio Division of Watercraft. They teach basic navigation, radio communications, boat handling, maintenance, boating safety, and boating support functions. All ONM training hours are documented and can be applied toward obtaining a captain's license from the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nThe Ohio Naval Militia is an organized all volunteer State Defense Force, which serves under the direction of the Governor of the State of Ohio as Commander in Chief through the office of the Adjutant General. They are governed by Ohio Revised Code chapters 5921, 5923, and 5924. \n\nCommand:\n\nUnder Ohio law, members of the Ohio Naval Militia are guaranteed the same employment rights and protections as federal reservists enjoy under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Among other legal rights guaranteed under this provision, Ohio Naval Militia members are protected from discrimination based on their membership in the Ohio Naval Militia both during the hiring process and after becoming employed; they are also guaranteed a leave of absence from their places of employment whenever they are activated for training or to take part in an emergency, and their employers are required to reinstate these employees to their previous positions when they return from deployment.\n\n\n"}

The name came from Horner's nickname, \"White Lightning\", and the remarkable speed of both wrestlers.\n\nA babyface team, they won the NWA National Tag Team Championship from The Hollywood Blonds. The Lightning Express split up soon after, and each went his separate way, until they reformed in Jim Crockett Promotions in 1986. Here they feuded with The Midnight Express and the team of Ivan Koloff and Krusher Khruschev, over the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. \n\nThey left Crockett for the Universal Wrestling Federation in 1987, where they won the UWF Tag Team Championship from Sting and Rick Steiner and feuded with The Sheepherders. When Jim Crockett, Jr. bought the UWF in 1987, the team returned to his promotion. On the October 24th, 1987 episode of Power Pro Wrestling they were defeated for the UWF titles by The Sheepherders. The Express continued to wrestle together until 1988, when they split up. \n\nIn July 1990 Tim Horner returned to WCW and almost immediately began teaming again with Armstrong. The Lightning Express had their first match back on July 16th, 1990 in Gainesville, GA during a WCW Saturday Night taping, defeating Arn Anderson & Barry Windham by disqualification. On August 20th at a WCW Power Hour taping the duo defeated NWA United States Tag Team Champions The Midnight Express via disqualification. Their win streak was snapped at two, as they fell to The Master Blasters in the debut at Clash of the Champions XII on September 5th. This would be their last teaming for several months, as Horner formed a tandem with Mike Rotundo while Armstrong received a singles push as \"The Candyman\". \n\nThe Express returned to action on January 8th, 1991 at a WCW Saturday Night taping, wrestling The Fabulous Freebirds to a double-disqualification. They would team again later in the month to face The Horsemen on another episode of Saturday Night. On the March 2nd episode of WCW Saturday Night the Express was defeated by The Freebirds in what would be their final WCW match for four years. \n\nThe duo was briefly reunited after Tim Horner rejoined WCW in 1995, the team name was rarely mentioned on-air. Armstrong & Horner made their first appearance on a February 3rd, 1995 taping of WCW Worldwide in Orlando, FL. In a match that later aired on April 9th, they were defeated by The Blue Bloods. A week earlier (in a match taped on March 22nd at Center Stage for WCW Saturday Night), the pairing received a non-title match against WCW World Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat, but were unsuccessful. They received a rematch against The Blue Bloods at an April 5th taping for The Main Event, but were again unsuccessful. In a dark match at an April 12th taping of WCW Saturday Night they were defeated by Arn Anderson & Ric Flair, but later in the night earned their first victory in their comeback when they defeated Len Denton & Jim Rogers in a match that aired April 22nd. A day later they also beat Tony Vincent & Jim Rogers by pinfall, in what would be their final WCW match. \n\n"}

It is a sequel to the hit 1998 television miniseries \"Merlin\" with Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson reprising their roles as Merlin and the Lady of the Lake, albeit slightly different versions of their characters.\n\nWhile being vaguely based on Arthurian legend, its plot is set after the death of King Arthur and completely different from the traditional legends.\n\nSatisfied at Camelot's conditions, Merlin (Sam Neill) decides to go on vacation in order to rejuvenate. This vacation nap is supposed to last a few months, but when Merlin awakes, he finds he has slept for fifty years. Upon his return to Camelot, he discovers a downtrodden place. Almost all of those he knew have died; Lord Weston (Garwin Sanford) runs the kingdom; and the Holy Grail has departed from the castle. However, Merlin's protective enchantments have held invaders in check.\n\nA young thief named Jack (John Reardon) and his tagalong pig Sir Snout stowaway in a cart entering Camelot, angering its driver Squire Brian. Jack is no ordinary vagrant, as he possesses some rudimentary magical skills. Jack enters the chamber of Yvonne (Tegan Moss), granddaughter of Sir Gawain and steals a pendant. Yvonne enters and while Jack hides, Master Graham (Christopher Jacot), a local blacksmith whom she loves, visits her. Jack then attempts to steal Merlin's wand while Merlin concentrates on the whereabouts of the Grail. Merlin senses the visitor, and at first evicts him, but later apprentices Jack after a vision of the Holy Grail appears to both of them.\n\nThe only training the film shows is Merlin tempting Jack with food while telling Jack to resist his hunger and seek a ring that was lost in the castle (which turns out to be the former Round Table). It is around this time that Jack learns the truth of Brian, who is actually Brianna (Meghan Ory). She disguises herself in order to avenge a wrong done to her family.\n\nIn his search for the grail, Merlin suspects something is afoul in Camelot that caused the Grail to depart. Merlin confronts Yvonne (who is to be married to Lord Weston when the Grail returns) and her guardian Master Burton (Andrew Jackson). Later while touching the Grail's stand, Merlin sees a vision in which he learns the truth of his absence. The Lady of the Lake (Miranda Richardson) enchanted him and created Jack. Thus, Jack's father is Merlin and his mother is the Lady. (This differs from the first film in that the Lady was an almost uninterested party while Merlin battled with her sister Queen Mab.)\n\nBarbarians threaten Camelot's door, and knights including Brian want to use an enchanted cave in order to surprise the invaders, who they think are building a dam to drown the kingdom. Jack agrees to lift Merlin's enchantment on the passage, but the knights find no construction. In the meantime, the Barbarians directed by the Lady of the Lake enter the passage and breach Camelot's walls, which are vulnerable from the inside.\n\nRealizing the impending doom, Merlin tells Jack the truth of his origins. Merlin & Jack coordinate to magic a bridge over the barbarian army to safety, but when Brianna is put in danger, Merlin tells Jack to go to her and completes the bridge alone (an effort that fatally drains him) commanding the townspeople, including Jack, to escape. As Jack steps off the bridge he breaks the spell to foil the pursuers. Meanwhile, Merlin was left in the walls of Camelot and is decapitated by Rauskaug (Alexander Kalugin), the leader of the barbarians.\n\nThe remaining people of Camelot have traveled the countryside for several months, seeking the Grail while fleeing their enemy. Jack is frustrated that his concentration does not give him insight, so the Lady of the Lake sends him a vision of the Grail's whereabouts. The group goes there, to discover that the water is cursed and several knights are murdered by a beast as they attempt to swim to the Grail's cave. Meanwhile, the Lady has told Rauskaug of their location and the barbarians begin their pursuit.\n\nThe film centers on the crimes of the Camelot's guardians, which they believe prevent their reaching of the Grail. Yvonne's parents presented her as Gawain's kin but this ruse is discovered when she begs Jack to explore her past through visions. Through these it is discovered that Master Burton and Lord Weston had oppressed the surrounding peoples with taxes, unfair trade, and devious agreements. This is the source of Brianna's anger, as her family was robbed of its property through such a contract.\n\nBefore Jack goes through Yvonne's past, Yvonne and Graham (Yvonne's true love) go behind a tree and kiss. In that time Jack and Brianna decide to give in to love and start to kiss. They are caught kissing by the other two. Jack tries to put it off as a joke, but though Yvonne and Graham now know Brian is a girl, they don't tell anyone.\n\nIn the meantime, Burton hopes to betroth Yvonne to a Scottish king and indenture the remaining citizens of Camelot to that lord for personal gain. Yvonne and Jack reveal Burton and his wife's past treachery, and instead of a quick execution Jack hopes a trial will cleanse Camelot of its sins. Instead Brianna takes justice into her own hands and kills the pair as the barbarians approach.\n\nWhile the two sides battle, Lord Weston accompanies Jack to the cave. Jack parts the waterfall, and they enter the cave. Jack warns Weston that he is the true stain on Camelot and advises him not to take the grail. When Weston touches it, his impurity turns him to dust. The Lady of the Lake appears and offers Jack a chance to become powerful. Instead he rejects his mother (apparently killing her) and makes a wish of the Grail: Jack says that the Grail may do what it wishes with him, if it will only end the destruction outside. The Grail accepts this unselfish act, and reanimates the dead warriors on both sides. Graham holds it aloft and promises a new Camelot will be built.\n\nGraham and Yvonne marry. During the reconstruction, Sir Snout tells Jack to speak the name of the land of the dead (Tartarus) in order to see his father. Jack goes to Merlin, and the two are allowed to spend the time they didn't have as father and son. The film concludes by hinting that Jack and Brianna are now married and probably going to have children. The film ends when Jack picks up Brianna as she blows out a candle, ending the movie.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2205691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205691", "title": "Telicity", "text": "Telicity\n\nIn linguistics, telicity (from the Greek , meaning \"end\" or \"goal\") is the property of a verb or verb phrase that presents an action or event as being complete in some sense. A verb or verb phrase with this property is said to be \"telic\", while a verb or verb phrase that presents an action or event as being \"incomplete\" is said to be \"atelic\".\n\nOne common way to gauge whether an English verb phrase is telic is to see whether such a phrase as \"in an hour\", in the sense of \"within an hour\", (known as a \"time-frame adverbial\") can be applied to it. Conversely, a common way to gauge whether the phrase is atelic is to see whether such a phrase as \"for an hour\" (a \"time-span adverbial\") can be applied to it. This can be called the \"time-span/time-frame test\". According to this test, the verb phrase \"built a house\" is telic, whereas the minimally different \"built houses\" is atelic:\n\nOther phrases can be tested similarly; for example, \"walked home\" is telic, because \"John walked home in an hour\" is fine, while \"John walked home for an hour\" is bad, and \"walked around\" is atelic, because \"John walked around in an hour\" is bad, while \"John walked around for an hour\" is fine.\n\nIn applying this test, one must be careful about a number of things.\n\nOne often encounters the notion that telic verbs and verb phrases \"refer\" to events that \"have endpoints\", and that atelic ones \"refer\" to events or states that \"don't have endpoints\". The notion of \"having endpoints\" applies to \"events in the world\" rather than the \"expressions\" that refer to them. This is the most criticized property of this definition. In fact, \"every\" event or state \"in the world\" begins and ends at some point, except, perhaps, for states that can be described as \"the existence of the universe.\" Certainly, John's \"being angry\" has a beginning, and, unless John is somehow \"eternally angry\", it also has an endpoint. Thus, it is doubtful that one can define telic expressions by means of properties of the events or states that they \"refer\" to (a very similar problem arises with the notion that mass nouns refer to \"things that can't be counted\"). Thus, recent attempts at making the notion explicit focus on the \"way\" that telic expressions \"refer\" to, or \"present\" events or states.\n\nPut differently, one can simply define telic verbs and verb phrases as referring to events conceptualized or presented as having endpoints, and atelic verbs and verb phrases as those conceptualized or presented as lacking endpoints.\n\nThis type of exercise can serve as a reminder of the futility of trying to link linguistic semantics to the real world without considering the intermediary agent of human cognition.\n\nAccording to Garey (1957), who introduced the term \"telic\",\ntelic verbs are \"verbs expressing an action tending towards a goal envisaged as realized in a perfective tense, but as contingent in an imperfective tense\"; atelic verbs, on the other hand, are \"verbs which do not involve any goal nor endpoint in their semantic structure, but denote actions that are realized as soon as they begin\".\n\nPerhaps the most commonly assumed definition of telicity nowadays is the algebraic definition proposed by Manfred Krifka. Krifka defines telic expressions as ones that are quantized. Atelic ones can be defined in terms of cumulative reference. An expression 'P' can be said to be quantized if and only if it satisfies the following implication, for any choice of x and y:\nSuppose, for example, that John built two houses. Then each of the two building events can be described as \"built a house\". But the building of the one house isn't, and indeed \"cannot\" be thought of a proper part of the building of the second. This contrasts with states describable as, say, \"walk around aimlessly\". If John walked around aimlessly for two hours, then there will be many proper parts of that, that last, say 10 minutes, or 1 hour, etc. which also can be described as \"walk around aimlessly\". Thus, for \"walk around aimlessly\", there will be many choices of x and y, such that both can be described as \"walk around aimlessly\", where x is a proper part of y. Hence, \"build a house\" is correctly characterized as telic and \"walk around aimlessly\" as atelic by this definition. Quantization can also be used in the definition of count nouns.\n\nAn expression 'P' is said to have cumulative reference if and only if, for any choice of x and y, the following implication holds:\nFor example, if there is an event of John walking around from 1pm to 2pm, and another event of his walking around from 2pm to 3pm, then there is, by necessity, a third event which is the sum of the other two, which is also an event of walking around. This doesn't hold for expressions like \"built a house.\" If John built a house from time 1 to time 2, and then he built another house from time 2 to time 3, then the sum of these two events (from time 1 to time 3) is \"not\" an event that can be described by \"built a house.\" Cumulativity can also be used in the characterization of mass nouns, and in the characterization of the contrast between prepositions like \"to\" and \"towards,\" i.e. \"towards\" has cumulative reference to (sets of) paths, while \"to\" does not.\n\nTelicity or \"telic aspect\" has been read as a grammatical aspect lately, indicating a reached goal or action completed as intended. Languages that contrast telic and atelic actions are Pirahã and Finnic languages such as Finnish and Estonian; Czech and Hungarian also have perfective prefixes \"pre-\" and \"meg-\", respectively, which are additionally telic.\n\nIn Finnish, the telicity is mandatorily marked on the object: the accusative is telic, and the partitive is used to express atelicity. More accurately, the accusative case is used of objects that are completely affected by the situation as presented by the speaker, whereas using partitive implies that the object is only partially affected in the situation or that the situation is framed so that the object continues to be affected outside it. The terms \"telic\" and \"atelic\" are not traditionally used in Finnish grammatical description; instead, it is customary to speak of \"resultative\" and \"irresultative\" sentences.\n\nAn example of the contrast between resultative and irresultative in Finnish:\n\nThe telic sentence \"necessarily\" requires finishing the article. In the atelic sentence, it is not expressed whether or not the article is finished. The atelic form expresses ignorance, i.e. atelic is not anti-telic: \"Kirjoitin artikkelia ja sain sen valmiiksi\" \"I was writing the article-PART and then got it-ACC finished\" is correct. What is interpreted as the goal or result is determined by the context, e.g.\n\nThere are many verbs that correspond to only one telicity due to their inherent meaning. The partitive verbs roughly correspond with atelic verbs in Garey's definition, that is, the action normally does not have a result or goal, and it would be logically and grammatically incorrect to place them in the telic aspect. However, even inherently atelic verbs such as \"rakastaa\" \"to love\" can in semantically unusual constructions, where a kind of result is involved, become telic:\n\n\nAlso, many other stative verbs that are in terms of their meaning inherently atelic, mark their objects in the accusative case, which is the normal case for telic situations:\n\n\nFurthermore, the telicity contrast can act as case government, so that changing the case can change the meaning entirely. For example, \"näin hänet\" (I saw him-ACC) means \"I saw him\", but \"näin häntä\" (I saw him-PART) means \"I met him (occasionally, sometimes, every now and then)\". This is often highly irregular.\n\nThe use of a telic object may implicitly communicate that the action takes place in the future. For example,\n\nOften telicity is superficially similar to the perfective aspect, and one can find descriptions such as \"roughly perfective–imperfective\". However, lexical pairs of perfective and imperfective verbs are found in Finnish, and this contrast can be superimposed with the telicity contrast.\n\nKrifka, Manfred, \"Origins of Telicity\".

Lane was known for her sexy outfits for the times and a sultry style of performing which garnered some minor controversy. In addition, Lane was the fourth wife of famous Latin bandleader and musician Xavier Cugat.\n\nBorn to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, Lane began her career at the age of four as a child actress on Vitaphone and radio. She began singing and dancing on Broadway. On Broadway she portrayed Bobo in \"Oh Captain!\" (1958).\n\nEarly in her career, Lane was billed as \"Abbe Marshall\". Using that name, she appeared in the Broadway shows \"Barefoot Boy with Cheek\" (1947) and \"As the Girls Go\" (1948).\n\nBecause of her work in Europe, Lane was known as an actress before she became recognized for her singing and dancing. She had a television program in Europe and made 21 films there early in her career.\n\nIn 1952 Lane married bandleader Xavier Cugat, who was 30 years her senior. During the 1950s and early 60s she worked as a nightclub singer and was described in a 1963 magazine article as \"the swingingest sexpot in show business.\" Cugat's influence was seen in her music, which favored Latin and rumba styles. In 1958 she starred opposite Tony Randall in the Broadway musical \"Oh, Captain!\" but her recording contract prevented her from appearing on the original cast album of the show. Eileen Rodgers performed her songs for the cast LP; Lane later recorded her songs on a solo album. Lane made several recordings for RCA Victor and Mercury. She worked with Tito Puente on the album \"Be Mine Tonight\" released in 1958. She appeared on talk shows with Cugat until 1963. In 1964, Lane and Cugat divorced. They had no children together during their marriage. That same year Lane married Perry Leff.\n\nLane attracted attention for her suggestive comments, such as \"'Jayne Mansfield may turn boys into men, but I take them from there.\" She said she was considered \"too sexy in Italy\". Her costume for an appearance on the \"Jackie Gleason Show\" was considered too revealing and she was instructed to wear something else. She was a guest on the television shows of Red Skelton, Dean Martin and Jack Benny.\n\nIn the later 1960s Lane starred in several Italian films. She performed on television variety programs such as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"The Steve Allen Show\", \"The Jack Paar Program\", \"The Mike Douglas Show\", \"The Hollywood Palace\", \"The Joey Bishop Show\", \"The Merv Griffin Show\" and \"The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson\" from the 1950s into the 1970s. She played guest roles in \"Naked City\", \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\", \"The Flying Nun\", \"F Troop\", \"The Brady Bunch\", \"Hart to Hart\", and \"Vega$\". Her last movie appearance was in \"\" (1983) in the minor role of an airline stewardess.\n\nIn 1992, Lane wrote the semi-autobiographical novel \"But Where Is Love?\" which described the painful memories of a teenage girl married to an older man.\nShe received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6381 Hollywood Boulevard for her contribution to television.\n\n\nWith Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra\n\n"}

He was trained as a doctor at the School of Medicine and Pharmacy in the Senegalese city of Dakar to become a medic. He first worked as an assistant medical officer in Guéckédou and then as a medical officer in Kissidougou. His political career began in 1953 as a town councillor. He was elected as Mayor of Kissidougou when he was 31 years old in 1954, and elected to the National Assembly of France in January 1956 as one of three deputies representing French Guinea. Under President Ahmed Sékou Touré, Beavogui was appointed to the government as Minister of Economic Affairs and Planning when Guinea gained its independence in 1958, and he was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1961. After the Guinean government allowed Kwame Nkrumah, the ousted President of Ghana, to live in exile in Guinea, the authorities in Ghana detained Beavogui at the airport in Accra while he was on his way to Ethiopia for a conference of the Organization of African Unity in October 1966. He remained Foreign Minister until May 1969, when he was moved back to his position as Minister of Economic Affairs.\n\nAt the end of the Ninth Congress of the ruling Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG) on 25 April 1972, President Touré said that Beavogui would become Prime Minister; that position had not previously existed.

The coup took place just hours before the PDG's political bureau was to select a new leader. Beavogui, a close friend of Touré, was widely expected to succeed him. The newly-minded PDG leader would have automatically elected to a seven-year term as president and confirmed in office in a referendum that spring. \n\nFollowing the coup, Beavogui was imprisoned in Kindia until being taken to Conakry for medical treatment.

{"id": "2205704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205704", "title": "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote", "text": "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\n\nThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote is a 2018 adventure-comedy film directed by Terry Gilliam and written by Gilliam and Tony Grisoni, loosely based on the 1605/1615 novel \"Don Quixote\" by Miguel de Cervantes. Gilliam unsuccessfully attempted to make the film many times over the span of 29 years, which made it an infamous example of development hell.\n\nGilliam started working on the film in 1989, but was unable to secure funding until 1998 when it entered full pre-production with a budget of $32.1 million without American financing, with Jean Rochefort as Quixote, Johnny Depp as Toby Grummett, a 21st-century marketing executive thrown back through time, and Vanessa Paradis as the female lead. Shooting began in 2000 in Navarre, but a significant number of difficulties such as sets and equipment destroyed by flooding, the departure of Rochefort due to illness, problems obtaining insurance for the production, and other financial difficulties led to a sudden suspension of the production and its subsequent cancellation. The original production was the subject of the documentary film \"Lost in La Mancha\", which was intended to be a making-of but was released on its own in 2002.\n\nGilliam made repeated attempts to relaunch production between 2003 and 2016, which included Depp, Ewan McGregor and Jack O'Connell as Toby and Robert Duvall, Michael Palin, and John Hurt as Quixote. However, all ended up being cancelled for various reasons, such as failing to secure funds, Depp's busy schedule and eventual loss of interest in the project, and Hurt being diagnosed with the cancer that would eventually result in his death. After yet another failed attempt, it was unexpectedly reported in March 2017 that filming had finally started, with Adam Driver, who was confirmed as Toby in 2016 and helped secure funding, and Jonathan Pryce as Quixote. On 4 June 2017, Gilliam announced that the shooting of the film was complete, 17 years after it originally started.\n\n\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" premiered on 19 May 2018, simultaneously acting as the closing film at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival and being released in French theaters. Gilliam faced difficulties in the process of releasing the film worldwide, partially due to a lengthy legal dispute with former producer Paulo Branco. Subsequently, the film was only released in a few other countries, including Belgium, Spain and Portugal; it was released in the United States and Canada on 10 April 2019, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 31 January 2020.\n\nToby Grummett, a director, is in rural Spain, struggling with the production of a commercial featuring Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. After an unsuccessful day of shooting, Toby's superior, the Boss, introduces him to a Romani street merchant who sells him an old DVD of \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\". By coincidence, Toby wrote and directed the film ten years earlier as a student. Toby watches the film while in bed with the Boss's wife, Jacqui. When the Boss returns to the hotel room, Toby barely escapes undetected.\n\nA flashback shows student Toby casting elderly cobbler Javier as Don Quixote. Javier initially falters in his characterization, but upon rushing to defend Angelica when a member of Toby's crew plays a prank on the teenage waitress, succeeds in embodying that \"I am Don Quixote\".\n\nToby realizes that his current shoot is near the shooting location of \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\". Taking a motorbike to Los Sueños, he learns that Angelica has moved away from her father Raul. Toby meets Javier, now working as a tourist attraction. He discovers that Javier has become convinced that he is the real Don Quixote, and that Toby is his squire, Sancho Panza. Quixote accidentally causes a fire that spreads through the town, as Toby escapes on the motorbike.\n\nOn the set, police are investigating the \"break in\" of Jacqui's room. The police notice that Toby's bike was the one spotted in Los Sueños and take him in for questioning. En route, they encounter Don Quixote on his horse Rocinante, who demands that the officers release Toby. When they dismiss him, Quixote attacks, culminating in one of the officers being shot and the Romani man stealing the police car. Quixote supplies Toby with a donkey and clothes from the set, and they set off for adventures.\n\nQuixote notices a windmill and believes it is a giant attacking a woman. Receiving a head wound after being knocked by one of the windmill's blades, Quixote and Toby are led by the woman to a decrepit ruin occupied by impoverished people. The leader, Barbero, welcomes them warmly but locks them in an attic. That night, Toby comes to suspect that they are secretly terrorists, but soon finds that the ruin has transformed into a 17th-century village. Toby manages to evade some guards, then awakens the next morning, the night's events having seemingly been a dream, and learns that the residents are not terrorists but fearful undocumented immigrants to whom Quixote, having experienced Toby's \"dream\", is regaling with a tale of it.\n\nMoving on with Quixote, Toby finds a bag of old Spanish gold and attempts to hide it, but accidentally falls down a ravine into a cave. There he re-encounters Angelica, who tells him that she works as an escort, and is the \"property\" of Alexei Miiskin, a Russian vodka company owner entering a business deal with the Boss.\n\nQuixote leads Toby on a quest to find Angelica but soon enters a jousting match with the \"Knight of Mirrors\", revealed to be Raul. He and several Los Sueños townspeople had been disguising themselves in an attempt to get Javier to come home. After Quixote rides off, Raul punches Toby for indirectly causing his daughter to become an escort.\n\nWaking up, Toby finds Quixote whipping himself with thorns to prove his love to Dulcinea del Toboso. Healing his wounds by a river, Toby is found by Jacqui on horseback, dressed for a costume party at Miiskin's. Arriving at Miiskin's castle, Toby sees him behave cruelly towards Angelica and Javier. Toby tries to convince both of them to leave but Quixote refuses and Angelica is captured. Toby rescues Angelica, but finds it is Jacqui wearing a mask, who reveals that Angelica is being burned alive by Miiskin as part of his entertainment. Toby accidentally knocks Quixote out of a window; dying on the ground, Quixote gives Toby his sword, telling him that he never truly saw him as lowly. Angelica's burning is shown to be a special effect and Quixote dies while Toby recalls Quixote's claim of immortality.\n\nThe next morning, Toby, now Quixote, attacks three windmills, believing them to be giants, with Angelica at his side. The two agree to call her Sancho Panza and they ride into the sunset.\n\n\nTerry Gilliam first read the novel in 1989, and started conceptualizing an adaptation right away. He saw a personal project in adapting \"Don Quixote\", as it embodies many of the themes that run through his own work—such as the individual versus society, and the concept of sanity. Instead of a literal adaptation, Gilliam's film was about \"an old, retired, and slightly kooky nobleman named Alonso Quixano [who] reads too many chivalric romances. Taking leave of his senses, he sets out to fix the world and revive chivalry, clad in makeshift armor and accompanied by a donkey-owning farmer named Sancho Panza, who serves as his squire\".\n\nGilliam signed a deal with Phoenix Pictures as the studio to make the film in 1990 under the name \"Don Quixote\". Sean Connery was in talks to star as Quixote, but Gilliam disliked the idea because \"Quixote is air and Sean is earth\". Nigel Hawthorne and Danny DeVito were also in talks to star as Quixote and Panza respectively. However, Gilliam ultimately decided that the budget the studio offered him was too low and dropped from the project to focus on \"The Defective Detective\", another film he ultimately failed to make. Phoenix Pictures chose Fred Schepisi to replace Gilliam, with John Cleese as Quixote and Robin Williams as Panza, and Steven Haft, Quincy Jones and David Salzman as producers. This version would have been based on an old screenplay by Waldo Salt. However, it was officially cancelled in 1997.\n\nIn 1997, Gilliam stated, \"The years I wasted on this one! I was so frustrated with Hollywood, I went after European money, needing $20 million. And they said, 'You're on.' But I found out I needed more money. [...] That really hurts, that I let a project I'm convinced I'm the best director on the planet to do, slip by.\"\n\nAfter Schepisi's project collapsed, Gilliam resumed working on the film with co-writer Tony Grisoni, giving it the new name \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\". Instead of featuring a man named Alonso Quixano and Sancho Panza, this new version would instead feature Toby (in early versions \"Toby Grisoni\", as a joke between Gilliam and co-writer Tony Grisoni), a 21st-century marketing executive thrown back through time and who meets Don Quixote. Their version would also have borrowed elements from Mark Twain's 1889 novel \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\", including its time travel elements; after having failed \"Don Quixote\"s original attempt, Gilliam had unsuccessfully tried to adapt \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" into a film.\n\nGilliam announced \"Don Quixote\" to be his next project at the UK premiere of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" in 1998, with pre-production starting the same year. Gilliam, tired with Hollywood wanting creative control on his films, had decided to make the film in Europe instead, which according to him was \"one big monstrous problem\". It was set to have been one of the biggest continental European films ever made, with a budget of $32.1 million that had been scaled back from an original $40 million, and would have been filmed in Spain and throughout Europe. It was to have been one of Gilliam's most ambitious films, produced without any American financing; according to Gilliam, this budget was \"half the money we need\". René Cleitman was one of the film's producers. At the time, Gilliam stated, \"I hope it's going to be fun. It's been such a long slog to get to this point today.\" Working Title Films was offered the project, but turned it down because of the needed budget.\n\nJean Rochefort was picked to play Don Quixote, in preparation for which he spent seven months learning English. Toby was to be played by Johnny Depp, who had starred in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", and Vanessa Paradis would have been his love interest. Other actors who were to appear in the film included Miranda Richardson, Christopher Eccleston, Rossy de Palma, Jonathan Pryce, and Sally Phillips.\n\nFilming started in September 2000, with Nicola Pecorini as cinematographer. The first location shoot was at Bardenas Reales, a scenic, barren area in Navarre, Spain, near a NATO military base. Shortly before filming, the crew unexpectedly found out that several actors had conflicting schedules that would not match each other, making it unsure how and when to film scenes that would feature those same actors at the same time. On the very first day of shooting, F-16 fighter aircraft flew overhead repeatedly, ruining the audio recording and mandating a later re-dubbing in post-production. A flash flood then followed on the second day of filming, washing away and destroying significant portions of equipment and changing the color of the barren cliffs, making previously filmed material unusable due to continuity issues. The crew spent the next days trying to recover the equipment or obtain new supplies, but it eventually turned out that the film's insurance did not cover the damage caused by the flood. Several actors also did not show up on set for filming.\n\nOn the fifth day, filming resumed, but when Rochefort, an able horseman, attempted to ride and act, he was obviously wincing in pain, and required assistance dismounting and walking; he notably suffered from prostate issues, which proved very problematic when riding a horse. This made the newly filmed footage unusable, as Rochefort's pain was obvious on camera, and production was suspended while Rochefort flew hurriedly to his doctor in Paris, where he was additionally diagnosed with a double herniated disc. For several days the crew attempted to shoot scenes that did not involve Rochefort – including a scene with Depp at Monasterio de Piedra – but as time passed, it became unclear whether Rochefort would be able to return or not. Pecorini stated at the time \"Never in 22 years of being in this business have I seen such a sum of bad luck.\" Gilliam was very disappointed by this, as he had spent two years trying to cast the perfect actor for Quixote. Despite his continued efforts, production was finally cancelled in November 2000.\n\nAfter the production had been cancelled, an insurance claim was filed on behalf of the film's investors. US$15 million were reportedly paid, and the rights to the screenplay passed on to the insurance companies. Since 2003, Gilliam kept on trying to make the film, but to no avail. His first new attempt, six months after the release of \"Lost in La Mancha\", was quickly turned down. In 2005, Gilliam voiced his interest in re-casting the role of Don Quixote with Gérard Depardieu. The film quickly gained the reputation of being cursed, notably after the release of \"Lost in La Mancha\", making it even harder for Gilliam to find financial support.\nIn the meantime, Gilliam made other films, stating, \"Every film I've done since then has been because I couldn't get \"Quixote\" made.\" Those other productions mostly collapsed, like the Nicolas Cage-led \"The Defective Detective\" or an adaptation of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's novel \"Good Omens\" (which was cancelled after the September 11 attacks due to the content being judged too dark), or were also met with significant issues: he notably clashed with producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein on the making of \"The Brothers Grimm\", leading to them firing his cinematographer Nicola Pecorini, and had to replace \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\"s lead actor Heath Ledger after his death halfway through filming.\n\nIn July 2006, after nearly six years of legalities between the French producers and German insurers, the issue over the rights was settled. Terry Gilliam announced this at the Munich International Documentary Film Festival, saying that the production company was willing to give Gilliam the rights, and that Jeremy Thomas was still interested in producing. In August 2006, Gilliam indicated at a post-screening Q&A for \"Tideland\" that the complex legal case concerning the film's collapse was finally being wrapped up, and that the rights to the script would hopefully be given back to Gilliam and co-writer Grisoni in the near future. He stated his intention to completely reshoot the film.\n\nJohnny Depp was at times still connected to the project, but it remained unclear if Depp's filming schedule would have allowed for his participation and if he wanted to join the production at all. During a press junket in 2009 for his film \"Public Enemies\", Depp stated: [Gilliam and I] have talked about it. But to be honest, the thing about Terry... I love Terry, and I'd do anything the guy wants to do. But with \"Quixote\"... my dance card is pretty nutty for the next couple of years. So I'd hate to put him in a position—or ask to be in a position—where he'd have to wait for me. That would be wrong. But also, I feel like we went there and tried something, and whatever it was—the elements and all the things that got up underneath us—were there and happened and were documented well in that film \"Lost in La Mancha\". So I don't know if it's right for me to go back there. I don't know if it's right for Terry too, but if he wants to...\n\nIn 2008, Gilliam restarted preliminary work on a new version of the film. The film would be reshot completely, and Rochefort's role had been recast. In 2008, Michael Palin reportedly entered talks with Gilliam to step in for Rochefort and play Don Quixote. In November 2009, Gilliam said he had finished re-casting the role, but he refused to disclose the actor's identity. In a December 2009 interview with Collider, Robert Duvall claimed on-camera to be Gilliam's new choice for Don Quixote; this was later confirmed by Gilliam, with Depp still attached to co-star as Toby. Since Depp was signed for two Disney films, further production delays were suspected, but commencement of shooting was scheduled for early 2010. Whether the production timetable would have been maintained is unknown, because Depp stated that he would not make room in his tight schedule for Gilliam's film. Depp even noted that he was not sure if he wanted to revisit the revived film project at all. The film was to be produced by Jeremy Thomas for Recorded Picture Company. International sales would have been handled by HanWay Films. On 17 May 2010, it was announced Ewan McGregor had been cast in the film.\n\nGilliam entered main pre-production once again in 2009. After finally retrieving the rights to the screenplay, Gilliam and Grisoni started to rewrite the plot in January 2009 and hoped to be finished within a month. In 2010, Gilliam stated that primary casting was finalised, with Duvall and McGregor still attached; however on 5 September of the same year, he revealed that funding had collapsed a month and half earlier and as a result shooting was delayed. By 2012, Duvall was still potentially attached to the film, but not McGregor, with Tony Grisoni commenting the same year \"Us survivors of \"Don Q\" are a strange kind of dysfunctional family. Every year since we have rewritten the screenplay. And we've got quite good at it. You will be pleased to hear the Don is back up and in the saddle and ready to ride under new colours.\" In November 2013 during the promotion of \"The Zero Theorem\" at the Venice Film Festival, Gilliam told \"Variety\" \"I'm going to try to do it again, [...] We'll see if it happens. I just want to make it and get rid of it. Get it out of my life.\"\n\nIn January 2014, Gilliam published on his Facebook page that \"Dreams of Don Quixote have begun again. [...] Will we get the old bastard back on his horse this year?\" In an interview with \"Empire\"s website, Gilliam stated that production would start up again 29 September 2014 in the Canary Islands. Spanish producer Adrián Guerra was on board to fund the project. Gilliam said of Guerra, \"He's really smart, loves movies. He's young enough to still love movies, but we've still got to cast it and get the money but other than that, that's the deal.\" New concept art by Gilliam collaborator Dave Warren was also released. In August 2014, in an interview with TheWrap, Gilliam revealed that he had received funding, and that the plot of the film has changed: \"Our main character actually made a Don Quixote movie a lot earlier in his history, and the effect it had on many people wasn't very nice. Some people go mad, some people turn to drink, some people become whores.\" In September 2014, actor John Hurt confirmed he'd become attached to the film as the titular role of Quixote, replacing Robert Duvall.\n\nIn a September 2014 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Gilliam said that making \"Don Quixote\" next \"[...] is my plan, but plans have nothing to do with reality. We shall see what happens. I really can't say anything at the moment, because there's been a little hiccup — once again. The Sisyphean rock that keeps rolling back. Just as we almost get to the top of the mountain... We'll see what happens. I'm not a happy camper at the moment.\" When asked why he continues to attempt making the film, Gilliam said, \"Oh, I don't know, pigheadedness, stupid – I really don't know anymore. I'm beginning to actually think, 'If it doesn't work this time, I'm gonna dump it.' I've wasted far too much of my life doing it. If you're going to do Quixote, you have to become as mad as Quixote. [...] I've wasted how many years? Fifteen? Yeah, there's a certain point. It's kind of the determination to be crazy and unreasonable. Every intelligent person around me says, 'Walk away from it.' But those are reasonable people.\" In November 2014, Jack O'Connell was cast as Toby. Commenting on the changes on the script compared to the original version, Gilliam stated, \"It all takes place now, it's contemporary. It's more about how movies can damage people.\"\n\nOn 9 June 2015, Gilliam obtained a deal with Amazon Studios to release the film theatrically, followed by a streaming Amazon début. Gilliam said of the deal: \"I'm intrigued by their way of doing it. They go into the cinemas first and then a month or two afterwards they go into streaming. And I think that's good because you get a chance to see it on the big screen, and yet I know that more people have seen my films on DVD than they have in the cinemas and that's the reality of life now.\" In September 2015, the film's production was suspended once again, due to Hurt being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer shortly before filming. He eventually died from his cancer on 25 January 2017. Gilliam paid homage to him on Facebook, stating, \"Sadly, the earthly marvel that was John Hurt has departed us. Two years ago, he and I were off to make \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" when he was diagnosed with a particularly evil brand of cancer. Despite the terrible prognosis he was determined to carry on working. And he did. Right to the final curtain. In the end, cancer was the windmill that he couldn't defeat. John was not just a phenomenal actor, but a wickedly wonderful human being. I felt honoured to be a friend.\" That same year, original Quixote portrayer Jean Rochefort also died. Gilliam also paid homage to him: \"When I saw him a couple of years ago he seemed to be growing younger, not older. I imagined that, like Quixote, he was capable of living forever. That he should be gone is unbelievably sad. Farewell, Jean.\"\n\nAt the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016, Gilliam, in need of a minimum 16 million euros for the budget in order to make the film, was introduced to Portuguese producer Paulo Branco, who promised that he would obtain the needed budget by September, a few weeks before they would start the eleven weeks-long shoot.\n\nWith the film having entered pre-production once again, Gilliam cast Palin as Quixote, Adam Driver as Toby, and Olga Kurylenko as the female lead. Reportedly, Driver would have been paid 610,000 euros for the film, with Palin being paid 285,000 euros. Both of them took equitation lessons for the film shortly after being hired. Gilliam hired his daughter Amy Gilliam as unit production manager. The new version would be set in modern day, with Toby as a director shooting a commercial and coming across a copy of his old student film, a re-telling of the famous Don Quixote story, which leads him back to the little Spanish village where he shot it back in the days, only to get embroiled in a series of adventures and catastrophes.\n\nTensions soon arose, with Branco wanting creative control over the project; however, and despite having been warned against working with Branco, Gilliam believed that he had no other choice than to collaborate with him if he wanted \"Don Quixote\" to be filmed in the year, encouraged by Branco's successful financing of David Cronenberg's 2012 film \"Cosmopolis\". Similarly, Branco felt that Gilliam had \"a deep hate towards producers\". Shortly before the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, Amazon withdrew from the project because of Branco's reputation as producer, with Amazon representative Matthew Heintz sending a mail stating that \"in regard of the interactions we had with [Branco], we do not wish to pursue further negotiations with him\". Nevertheless, Gilliam stated during the Cannes Film Festival that the film would start shooting in October 2016.\n\nConflict escalated further when Branco tried to reduce the budget down from the promised 16 million. He also cut Palin's pay from 285,000 euros to 100,000 euros, which deeply angered Palin; when Gilliam wrote to Branco to complain that Palin's unexpected salary cut felt like a \"slap on the face\", Branco answered that the film needed \"a true producer\", referring to himself as the \"captain\" of the project. On 29 April 2016, Gilliam signed a deal where in exchange for producing the film, Branco would earn, in addition to his own salary, the salary of 750,000 euros Gilliam would have been paid for writing and directing the film. In addition to severing ties with several other production companies interested in the project, Branco soon tried to reduce the salaries of other crew members, including the hair stylist, the assistant director, and Amy Gilliam. He also tried to push Palin away from the project, considering him too old, to have his own sister hired as costume designer, to have filming moved forward by several months, and to have the film shot in digital instead of the 35 mm Gilliam wanted. Some of the film's other producers and its distributor stated that Branco told Gilliam \"Either you make this film my way, or you irremediably compromise the feasibility of the project and your film is condemned. It will never see the light of day.\"\n\nUltimately, Branco did not provide the promised funds for the film. When Gilliam complained, Branco answered that he \"would not accept this kind of spoiled kid behavior.\" On 6 August, Branco sent a mail to Gilliam urging him to accept his conditions, including a reduced budget, and to give Branco full creative control over the project, threatening to cancel the project altogether and fire the entire crew and cast otherwise. Terry Gilliam answered that those demands were unacceptable, and \"incompatible with the contract I have signed\", while Amy Gilliam called Branco's actions \"the behavior of a tyrant and a bully\". In response, Branco officially suspended production on 2 October. Gilliam kept on working, however, with new producers, stating, \"We should be here [at the Cannes Film Festival] next year with the finished film, and then you can ask me why I made such a mess of it or why I made such a wonderful film.\"\n\nOver the years, Gilliam and Grisoni kept on re-writing \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" as they kept on trying to make the film. The most notable change was the removal of the time travelling element central to the original 2000 production; instead of the character of Toby being thrown back through time, the film would instead take place in modern times, with the \"period elements\" being characters having a party dressed like in the ancient times. Toby would be revisiting a Spanish village he had once filmed a student film in, and discover that the shoemaker he had cast in the title role all those years ago has been living as Quixote ever since.\n\nGilliam stated, \"I'm incorporating the idea of the damage that films do to people, so it's become a bit more autobiographical.\" Jonathan Pryce, who was a part of both the original and final productions, stated, \"from what I can remember of the original script, this is an altogether better version. It's a clearer story. Terry's done a lot of rewrites – and he's had a lot of time to do rewrites.\"\n\nAfter Gilliam found new producers, he started production once again. Driver and Kurylenko were still attached as Toby and the female lead, with Pryce cast as Don Quixote. Pryce had previously starred in Gilliam's films \"Brazil\" (1985), \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" (1988), and \"The Brothers Grimm\" (2005), and was also cast in the original 2000 production of \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" in a different role. Gilliam stated, \"Jonathan has been wanting to [play Quixote] for 15 years – he's been making my life a misery. And now he's here and he's just extraordinary. The editor, who is Spanish, says that she can never imagine another Quixote. So it's as if the time was right: everything seemed to be ready to make this thing.\"\n\nGilliam stated that Driver was the perfect cast choice for Toby, calling him \"the guy I've been looking for all these years.\" Cast members later announced included Joana Ribeiro, Óscar Jaenada, Jason Watkins, Rossy de Palma, and Jordi Mollà.\n\nHaving found new producers who obtained the needed budget, Gilliam unexpectedly announced in March 2017 that filming had started for the first time since the original 2000 attempt; the announcements of Pryce's role, and Driver and Kurylenko still being attached to their roles, soon followed.\n\nDuring filming in May, Gilliam stated, \"In the end, we're doing this for much less money than we honestly need. But everyone involved, from the cast to the crew, are all working their asses off for a fraction of what they would normally be paid, because they just want to see this thing done. It's odd how being obsessive and not giving up can inspire other people to get involved. Fools that they are!\" He also stated, \"It was terrifying starting shooting this film finally after, well it originally started in 1989. That's a long time ago! To be thinking, dreaming it, writing and rewriting it, it was a horrible feeling... Yet what's interesting about a film – at a certain point it starts making itself. So it's not actually the film I set out to make. This is a slightly different film. It's doing its own work, and I'm just holding on for dear life!\" Driver stated that \"Terry couldn't control his enthusiasm, nor how deeply ingrained this movie was within his body. It seemed like an exorcism, every day we were making it.\" During filming, Gilliam commented on how well they were doing: \"I still worry. We've had too much luck, so it could go wrong at any moment. Today, the clouds are building. They'll probably block out the light and we'll have to go home.\"\n\nOn 4 June 2017, Gilliam announced that filming had finally been completed, 17 years after it originally started.\n\nOnly a few crew members constantly worked on the film between 2000 and the final product, including Gilliam, his daughter Amy (who co-produced the film), co-writer Tony Grisoni, cinematographer Nicola Pecorini, and production designer Benjamin Fernandez.\n\nIn November 2017, Gilliam stated that editing was nearly complete: \"We're just fiddling now, figuring out a few things here and there so it's pretty much what it is. We've got still months of work to do on visual effects, sound, music. But as far as the tale, it's pretty tight now and it's surprisingly wonderful\". On 23 December he stated \"The year is almost finished.. and so is \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\".\"\n\nIn May 2018, at the same time Amazon Studios dropped from the project, Gilliam suffered a minor medical complication that was erroneously reported as a stroke.\n\nDuring filming in Portugal, Gilliam's team was accused of damaging public properties, as well as the Convent of Christ, a notable convent in Tomar and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The accusation came from a report by Portuguese news channel RTP1, who stated that the crew had \"left behind chipped masonry, broken roof tiles and uprooted trees at the 12th-century Convent of Christ in Tomar, central Portugal.\" Gilliam denied the accusations, stating, \"I think the Convent of Christ is one of the most glorious buildings I have ever seen. Everything we did there was to protect the building from harm... and we succeeded. Trees were not cut down, stones were not broken. [...] There was not an iota of disrespect involved. People should begin by getting the facts before howling hysterically.\" An investigation by the Portuguese government took place during the following weeks to determine if the news report was accurate, with the presence of \"some damage\" being acknowledged, which was catalogued by the convent officials who monitored the filming. The destruction of the trees was determined to have occurred during the production of an earlier, unrelated film. On 4 July 2017, Portuguese authorities ruled that Gilliam's crew was only responsible for \"insignificant damage\", adding that the accusations \"lacked rigor and revealed a lack of scientific knowledge\".\n\nPaulo Branco, a former producer of the film, stated in June 2017 that this new version was \"illegal\" and that he, not Gilliam, owned the rights to the film, and that as such, any content shot for the film was the property of Alfama Films, one of the film's former production companies. Branco was a producer on the film during Gilliam's previous attempt at making it in 2016, and was supposed to find funds for the film; in exchange, Gilliam would give his salary as writer-director to Branco. Eventually, Branco did not provide the funds promised and suspended production only a few weeks before filming, leading Gilliam to find other producers with whom he was able to make the film. However, Branco claimed that he still owned the rights and was still owed Gilliam's salary despite not providing financial backing for the film as planned: according to Gilliam and the film's producers, he asked to be paid a total of 3.5 million euros, with 2 million before the release and 1.5 million afterwards.\n\nConsidering that Branco's failure to secure funds nullified their deal, Gilliam tried to have the legal contract invalidated in court twice in early 2017, once in Paris and once in London, so he could use the money from his salary to make the film; however, the court ruled in Branco's favor both times. In spring 2017, Gilliam attempted once again to nullify the contract, but the court of first instance ruled against it. Branco also accused Gilliam of having obtained the new funds for the film illegally, which Gilliam denied, claiming that HM Revenue and Customs was well-aware of the nature of said funds.\n\nThe film's current producers answered that Branco's claims were \"preposterous\" and that he had \"no rights whatsoever to \"Don Quixote\"\". Recorded Picture Company CEO Peter Watson stated, \"Senhor Branco's interpretation of the law borders on the picaresque. If he really wants to kill the venerable don, I suggest he takes up jousting.\" Gilliam himself stated that Branco \"wallows in his dark twisted madness dreaming megalomanic triumphs while spreading lies and threats\", while Branco stated that Gilliam was \"mad and mythomaniac\".\n\nAs of April 2018, Branco still claimed that the film could not be released without his permission, leading to the issue being debated in court; as the result, the premiere of the film at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival was cancelled. Both Gilliam's lawyer and Océan Films, the French distributor of the film, stated that Branco was actively trying to prevent the film from being included in festivals to pressure the producers into paying him so the issue could be settled in time for festivals, with Océan Films stating that Branco \"was never, is not and never will be the producer of Terry Gilliam's \"Don Quixote\"\" and adding that the producers and distributors \"would not yield to this attempt at intimidation\". They also stated that Branco had previously attempted to have filming cancelled, but that his claim had been rejected by the court on 19 May 2017.\n\nThe verdict was originally expected to be delivered on 15 May 2018, but was later delayed to 18 May, one day only before the possible release, where it was ultimately ruled that the film would be authorized to premiere in French cinemas. Branco immediately stated that he would keep on pursuing legal action against Gilliam and the film's release.\n\nAdditionally, Branco was also trying to prevent the film from premiering at the Cannes Film Festival, with a hearing taking place on 7 May to decide whether or not the film would be authorized to air at the festival. On 9 May, it was announced that the film would be allowed to premiere at Cannes.\n\nThe festival's organizers answered Branco's claims by stating, \"The Festival de Cannes' mission is to choose works purely on artistic grounds and the selection must, above all, be with the agreement of the film's director. This is the case here. Past experience had made us aware of possible legal action and of the risks we were running, but as it happens, when we took our decision, there was no opposition to the screening of the film at the festival.\" They added, \"Our entire profession knows that 'forcing matters' has always been Mr. Branco's favorite method, and we should recall that he organized a press conference a few years ago where he denounced the Festival de Cannes because it had not kept a 'promise to select' one of his films. This was an accusation which didn't go anywhere, because the festival does not make promises to select films.\"\n\nIn June 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Branco owning all rights to the film; Branco explained that he will seek damages from not only Gilliam (who the Court demanded pay €10,000 ($11,600) to Branco's production company), but to all parties involved in the making, completion, promotion, and screenings of the film: \"The ruling means that the rights to the film belong to Alfama. Any exploitation of the film up until now has been completely illegal and without the authorisation of Alfama,\" said Branco. \"We will be seeking damages with interest from all the people involved in this illegal production and above all, all those who were complicit in its illegal exploitation. We're holding everyone responsible. [...] the film's producers, [Paris-based sales company and producer] Kinology, all the others who supported the film, including those who distributed the film in France [Ocean Films] and the Cannes Film Festival, everyone.\" Branco said he found it \"astounding\" that all these parties had continued with the production and exploitation of the film without holding the rights. \"The film belongs in its entirety to Alfama. The film was made illegally. It's the first time, I've ever seen so many people embark on a mission to produce and exploit a film, without holding the rights. It's a unique case.\"\n\nLater that month, it was reported that although the Court ruled in favor of Branco, producer Mariela Busuievsky clarified that Gilliam in fact still retains the rights to the film, saying that Branco overstated his victory in the ruling. Gilliam never shot a frame of the film under the deal with Branco, and as such, the former producer does not own any rights. However, since Gilliam did a poor job of terminating his contract with Branco, there will be a financial settlement that will have to be made between the two parties and the ex-producer has been using this to claim a right to the finished film. Busuievsky went on to say that the latest ruling does say that Gilliam owes €10,000 and there will probably be more money required to settle. However, these financial issues don't affect the film's release. According to the producer, they chose to remain quiet about the actual major details because it didn't feel necessary, but when Branco went public with his victory and claimed rights to the film, they felt they had to step forward and air all the \"dirty laundry.\" The producer says they are making plans for European territories now, and the US distribution will be coming shortly. She says that \"there are many options\" in regards to US distributors.\n\nThe first image of the film, showing Don Quixote and Toby riding horses, was released on 21 February 2018. The first trailer was released for the French market on 5 April, featuring French text and subtitles, followed by an English-language trailer the following day.\n\nThe film premiered on 19 May 2018 as the closing film of the 2018 Cannes Film Festival (where it received a standing ovation), and was released in French theaters the same day.\n\nPaulo Branco, whose legal dispute with Gilliam prevented the film from competing for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, attempted to prevent the film from both being released in France and from being shown at Cannes. A hearing took place on 7 May to debate if the film could be shown at the festival, with the decision expected two days later. On 9 May, the court ruled in favor of the film being shown at Cannes. On May 18, court ruled in Gilliam's favor once again and authorized the film to be released in French theaters the following day; it would have a limited release, and would be shown in 255 theaters across the country. Critics at the Cannes Film Festival received an early screening the day before the release.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, despite contributing significant funding to the production, Amazon Studios confirmed that they would no longer distribute the film in the United States. It was released in Spain on 1 June.\n\nThe film premiered in Belgium on 20 June at the Brussels international Film Festival, before being released nationwide on 25 June. It will be released in China via the Turbo Film production company. On 17 September, Gilliam announced that the film would premiere in the United States on 20 September at Fantastic Fest. On 17 December, Screen Media Films acquired the North American rights to the film and set a March 2019 release. The film was released in the US and Canada on April 10, 2019 as a one night only showing in select theaters through Fathom Events.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63%, based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 5.93/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" may not live up to long-gestating expectations, but it bears enough of director Terry Gilliam's signature creative stamp to satisfy fans.\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average rating of 58 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nPeter Debruge with \"Variety\" magazine called the film \"a loud, belligerent, barely coherent mess\", stating \"the result feels like evidence of someone [Gilliam] who spent too long obsessing over Don Quixote, losing sight somewhere along the way of whatever attracted him in the first place.\" Gregory Ellwood at \"Collider\" felt that the film \"simply doesn't live up to its storied legacy in the annals of Hollywood film development\", giving it a C rating.\n\nBen Croll writing for \"TheWrap\" called \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" \"an awful lot of fun. Of course, the fun can be far from perfect. The film is also messy and hysterical in places, and by running an exhausting 132 minutes, it rather insistently overstays its welcome [...] We're so thrilled by the film's improbable existence that we're willing to go wherever Gilliam wants to take us, but respond with an extra degree of disappointment whenever he stumbles along the way.\" He summarized by saying, \"It's too much, it's out of step with today and it's oddly endearing.\"\n\nRobbie Collin for \"The Telegraph\" felt that \"even when the film feels like a circuitous, effortful mess, it's often an intentional one – and for everything in the film that doesn't quite connect, that element of self-portraiture, with the artist as sap, strikes a wistful chord. [...] Driver and Pryce fling themselves at everything with beady resolve, just as Gilliam gives it everything he has. Around 50 percent of it sticks – and to pretend the film was any more successful than that would do a disservice to this director's truly great films, not least \"Brazil\". But after everything \"Quixote\" has been through, 50 percent feels like enough.\" Peter Bradshaw at \"The Guardian\" stated: \"It may not be Gilliam's masterpiece, but it is a movie with sprightliness, innocence and charm and it is a morale boost to anyone who cares about creativity that Gilliam has got the film made at all. His own intelligence and joy in his work shine out of every frame, and his individuality is a delight when so much of mainstream cinema seems to have been created by algorithm.\"\n\nIn the years that followed its original cancellation, \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" became widely recognized as one of the most infamous examples of development hell in film history, and as one of the most famous films never made, even gaining the reputation of being cursed. IndieWire called the film \"one of the most troubled productions in the history of cinema\", while /Film believed they \"could write a book about the movie's problems\", stating, \"Heaven and hell seemed to unite in defiance of Terry Gilliam's \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\"\".\n\nCommenting on the making of the film, \"The Guardian\" commented on \"Mr Gilliam's visionary project disintegrating like a slow-motion car crash. The double hernia and slipped disc that zonked his lead actor, Jean Rochefort, the flash floods that swept away his camera equipment, the overhead Nato jets which wrecked his soundtrack, the actors who didn't show up, and finally, the implacable money-men who declared that the star's indisposition was not covered by insurance as it was an Act of God. The Act of a furious Old Testament God with a serious grudge against Terry Gilliam\". \"Geeks of Doom\" called the film's failure a \"legendary collapse\", while BBC stated that the film is \"synonymous with sustained and calamitous misfortune\".\n\nWhen the final film encountered legal issues due to the dispute with Paulo Branco in 2018, several journalists commented on the issue by stating that regarding the infamously complicated history of the film, its current legal issues were relatively inconsequential, with \"The Guardian\" stating, \"It's another bump in the long road for this most troubled of productions, though given the director has waited nearly two decades to see his magnum opus on screen, he can stand to hold on for a few more months.\" BBC stated before the film's release \"It is almost unbelievable that \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" is still being wounded by the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\" while \"Vox\" stated \"It remains to be seen whether the film is any good. But at this point, it almost doesn't matter. It will be a long time before \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" can be seen just as a movie, separate from its long saga of dreams and woes and catastrophes—which may actually be beneficial in the case of a movie about a knight with a foolish dream. The behind-the-scenes saga is part of the film's mystique and history, and whether it's great, terrible, or somewhere in between, that story is what historians, critics, and crowds will remember, long after the movie leaves theaters.\"\n\nGilliam himself admitted in May 2017 than the film's legendary reputation added more pressure on him: \"The problem is that people have very high expectations. And a lot of people say I'm a fool to make the film, and that it would have been better to let people imagine how great it would have been, rather than making it a reality and disappointing them. People love Roman ruins because they're not complete and you can imagine them. So I may be making a great mistake. Maybe the film would be better as a fantasy.\"\n\nAfter his 1988 film \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" was almost abandoned, Gilliam decided to document the making of all his films in case one of them was canceled. For \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\", he asked Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, who had been in charge of the making-of of his film \"12 Monkeys\", to film what should have ultimately been its making-of; however, after \"Don Quixote\" was cancelled, \"Lost in La Mancha\" was released in 2002 as a stand-alone documentary film about Gilliam's failed attempt at making the film.\n\nThe documentary received critical praise for its relevance on the difficulties inherent to filmmaking, and for its depiction of Gilliam as an artist. BBC called the film \"painful to watch: an astonishing 'un-making of' documentary which defines the phrase 'catalogue of disasters'\". Olga Kurylenko, who starred in the eventual 2018 film, stated about \"Lost in La Mancha\", \"You watch and you think, poor Terry. Why does this have to happen to this wonderful man? He doesn't deserve this. It's just crazy. But it wasn't meant to be, I guess. It wasn't the moment.\"\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, the writers and directors of \"Lost in La Mancha\", would release a follow-up film, titled \"He Dreamed of Giants\", which would cover the entire history of the film's making, with particular focus on what happened after the events depicted in \"Lost in La Mancha\". Pepe said that the film would be \"more introspective\" than \"Lost in La Mancha\", stating, \"This is more a film about an internal struggle in an artist's mind. What is it like for an artist to be standing on the brink of actually finishing this project finally? [...] Even on the set we would say the conflicts raging around Terry right now of making the movie are not nearly as interesting as what's going on inside his head.\"\n\n"}

His family was Jewish.\n\nJacobi began acting as a boy, making his stage debut in 1924 at a Toronto theater, playing a violin prodigy in \"The Rabbi and the Priest.\" After working as the drama director of the Toronto Y.M.H.A., the social director at a summer resort, a stand-up comic in Canada’s equivalent of the Borscht Belt, and the entertainment at various weddings and bachelor parties, Jacobi moved to London to work on the stage, appearing in \"Guys and Dolls\" and \"Pal Joey\". Jacobi made his Broadway debut in 1955 in \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" playing Hans van Daan, the less-than-noble occupant of the Amsterdam attic where the Franks were hiding, and reprised the role in the 1959 film version. Other Broadway performances included Paddy Chayefsky’s \"The Tenth Man\" (1959), Woody Allen’s \"Don’t Drink the Water\" (1966), and Neil Simon’s debut play \"Come Blow Your Horn\" (1961), in which he portrayed the playboy protagonist’s disappointed father. His reading of the film line \"Aha!\" stuck with the \"Times\" columnist William Safire so vividly that he cited it when writing about the meaning of the word 40 years later.\n\nJacobi also made two dozen feature films. His film debut was in the 1953 British comedy, \"Is Your Honeymoon Really Necessary?\" with the country’s blond sex symbol of the day, Diana Dors. Other notable films in which he appeared include, \"Irma la Douce\", \"Penelope\", \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)\" (1972) as Sam Musgrave, a middle-aged married man experimenting with women's clothes, \"Arthur\" (1981) as the lucky florist, \"My Favorite Year\" (1982) as Benjy's unsophisticated Uncle Morty, and in \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" (1987), as a man named Murray, zapped into the television, wandering throughout sketches looking for his wife.

His final film role was \"I.Q.\" (1994), playing philosopher/mathematician Kurt Gödel.\nHe guest-starred on such television shows as \"Playhouse 90\",\"Too Close for Comfort\",\"Tales from the Darkside\", \"Love, American Style\", \"That Girl\", \"Sanford and Son\" and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", and was a regular on \"The Dean Martin Show\". In the summer of 1976, Jacobi was the star of a CBS comedy series \"Ivan the Terrible\", in which he played a Russian headwaiter living with nine other people in a small Moscow apartment. Comics Christopher Hewett, Phil Leeds, Alan Cauldwell and, in her TV series debut, Nana Visitor (here billed under her birth name, Nana Tucker). Harvey Korman appeared as a Soviet bureaucrat in an uncredited cameo at the close of each episode. The executive producer of the short-lived series was noted comic Alan King. The comedy series only lasted 5 episodes.\n\nJacobi made successful comedy LP recordings with titles like \"Al Tijuana and His Jewish Brass\" and \"The Yiddish Are Coming! The Yiddish Are Coming!\"\n\nIn 1999, Jacobi, who was 85 at the time, was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.

The production was produced and directed by puppeteer and filmmaker Jim Henson, and was one of several experiments with the live-action film medium which he conducted in the 1960s, before focusing entirely on \"The Muppets\" and other puppet works. The screenplay was co-written by long-time Muppet writer Jerry Juhl.\nIn the previous year, Henson had produced a documentary for NBC Experiment in Television, \"Youth '68\".\n\nThe teleplay only aired twice: first on February 23 of 1969, with a rerun on February 21 of 1971.\n\nAn unnamed man, simply called \"The Man in the Cube\" (Richard Schaal), is trapped in a cube-like white room as he asks if anyone can hear him. A stool is brought in by a maintenance man named Arnie (Hugh Webster) who discovers it covered in strawberry jam as he wipes it down. After Arnie leaves, the Man tries to find the door. He encounters a variety of people come through various hidden doors in which each one claim that he can get out through his own door.\n\nHis first visitor is a woman named Margaret (Lolo Farell) who claims that the man is her husband Ted as she appears with parents (Alice Hill and Moe Margolese) are also present. Her door closes on the Man before she can get him out.\n\nThe Man then meets Mr. Thomas (Rex Sevenoaks), the manager of this entire establishment. When asked about the Cube, Mr. Thomas states that he has asked himself that question many times where it is too good to be true. Mr. Thomas shows the Man the Call Button that he should push if he ever needs anything. Mr. Thomas then works to deny the fact that there are other Cubes like this while stating that while some people are quite content and stay in the Cube, others would wish to leave. As Mr. Thomas leaves, he tells the Man that he must find his own door.\n\nArnie returns again where he gives the Man a telephone and states that he can get him anything he wants. Arnie exclaims that the only trouble with this establishment is that there is no organization and The Man wouldn't believe the weirdos that run it. He also talks about the four tons of chocolate rabbits while mentioning that he's been working here for 14 years where there hasn't been a request for chocolate rabbits. As Arnie goes outside to call the Man to see if the telephone is working, the Man sees a brief opening until the telephone rings and Mr. Thomas briefly appears to give the receiver to him before leaving. The Man answers it and Arnie tells him that the telephone is in business. The Man discovers that his telephone only calls up Arnie. When the Man throws it towards the wall, Arnie opens it as it flies through as Arnie rewards his accuracy by giving him a chocolate rabbit.\n\nTwo police officers consisting of a police sergeant (Jon Granik) and Officer Fritz (Guy Sanvido) from the MPD enter with a search warrant. They find different things in the panels of the Cube like smuggled diamonds in the chocolate rabbit, a stack of gold bullion from the Bank of Munich, vital plans of the X-74 (which was classified top secret), microfilm documenting the entire National Security System, an arsenal (consisting of machine guns, sten guns, dynamite), and a bound and gagged Dr. Kingsley (who was missing for two weeks as part of a ransom). The Man is then handcuffed by the police sergeant in an uncomfortable way as the police officers leave with everything while telling the Man to wait until they return.\n\nA house painter and decorator named Miss Bix (Sandra Scott) comes in while the Man tries to get out of his handcuffs as Arnie comes in with the mustard paint in order to decorate the Cube. She then changes her mind and wants tangerine paint as the Man struggles to get his leg out from the position the handcuffs have him in. Upon trying to hold back the info on how long the Man will be in the Cube, Miss Bix changes her mind about the paint and has shellac sprayed onto the already white Cube as she leaves. Arnie states to the Man that he is actually spraying deodorant and that Miss Bix can't tell the difference. Before leaving, Arnie stops the Man from following him since this is Arnie's door.\n\nA guitarist (Ralph Endersby) comes in and gives the Man the keys to the handcuffs which frees the Man. Upon finding a bed that manifested, the Man rests on it while the guitarist practices his music. The guitarist is then joined by the rest of his band as they sing a song to the Man about never getting out of the Cube. After the band leaves, Mr. Thomas briefly enters telling the Man that the \"Rest Period\" is over.\n\nA prisoner named Watson (Jack Van Evera) enters the Cube having escaped from his Cube. He notices that the Man hasn't been here for long while mentioning how his Cube had squares while the Man's Cube has rectangles. Watson tells the Man that he had to tell how many times has passed by making marks in his thumbnail which didn't work when he lost his thumbnails. Watson decides to return to his Cube to see if he left anything behind. When the Man states that if he re-enters his Cube where he won't get out again, Watson ranted about having to depend on the squares. Watson decides to go back to his Cube. When Mr. Thomas enters asking if someone else was in his Cube, the Man states that there was a visitor. Mr. Thomas states that other visitor was acting and introduces him to Jack Van Evera who asks Mr. Thomas if they can take out the part about the thumbnails. As they leave, Jack asks Mr. Thomas what the rest of these Cubes are for anyway. Before leaving, Mr. Thomas states \"He was only kidding. You know that.\"\n\nA seductress named Cora (Eliza Creighton) enters as a couch and a liquor cabinet suddenly appear. Cora states that she always comes to the Cube. The Man sits down on the couch. As they make out, a physician named Dr. Bradowski (Eric Clavering) enters with Dr. Bingham (Moe Margolese) and a nurse (Jean Christopher) run some medical tests on the Man while Cora leaves. The doctors tell the Man his results before leaving to tend to a platypus.\n\nA professor (Don McGill) enters stating that him being here is either part of a teleplay or he's hallucinating. He even shows him the ending with him in the Cube with a girl before leaving.\n\nA black militant (Don Crawford) enters where he finds the Man's Cube is all white thinking that it's a mausoleum for whiteness while claiming that the Man will die in the Cube. The Man claims that this isn't his place and had nothing to do with the Cube's construction. When the black militant wants the Man to go out the door, the Man states that he can't since it's the black militant's door. The black militant then leaves quoting \"You make me sick.\"\n\nA classy party manifests in the Man's cube. When Mr. Thomas arrives offering tonic to the guests, the Man tries to get some only to be blocked by a barrier. A female partygoer named Mrs. Stratton (Alice Hill) exclaims that Mr. Thomas is projected and states that nobody having a party in the Man's Cube is real. The image of the party then disappears as it shows the Man on his stool.\n\nAfter a panel briefly opens where an old man (Eric Clavering) asks if he has considered that he is dead and this is what his afterlife is like, the Man is visited by a scientist (William Osler) who asks the Man to define reality for him. When the Man claims that the hammer doesn't exist, the scientist proves him wrong by throwing the hammer at one of the cube's walls causing a hole in it. Arnie reprimands the scientist for breaking the wall and gives him his hammer back while he gets the wall fixed. Upon being unable to convince the Man, the scientist leaves hoping that the Man rots in the Cube. Arnie fixes the hole and leaves stating that the scientist is a real pain in the neck.\n\nA woman named Liza (Trudy Young) enters where she gives the Man a hint on how to get out which is \"it's going to get worse before it gets better.\" Her other hint is \"don't trust anybody\" as she turns into an elderly-like appearance (Ruth Springford). After she leaves, Mr. Thomas enters stating that the Man's time is up and that he must leave. As the Man tries to leave through the door that Mr. Thomas claims to be the Man's door, the Man has his suspicions in which if he steps out the door, two gorillas in ballerina dresses would grab him, drag him back into the cube, throw him to the ground, and dance around him singing \"Home! Sweet Home!\" The Man attempts to step out and is assaulted by the ballerina-dressed gorillas (depicted as two men in gorilla suits) in the manner that he described where they substitute \"home\" with \"the Cube.\" Mr. Thomas leaves stating that the Man is getting pretty good at predicting these things.\n\nTwo comics (Jon Granik and Guy Sanvido) enter and tell jokes to the audience. They then turn their attention to the Man when they find that he wasn't joining in on the laughter. The Man stated that he just didn't feel like laughing. The comics then laugh at the Man before leaving.\n\nA kid on a tricycle rides around the Cube mocking the Man stating that he's never going to get out of the Cube and then leaves.\n\nA monk (Jerry Nelson) enters and disperses his wisdom onto the Man while stating that he is part of the \"All.\" Before leaving, the monk gives the Man an orb called the Ramadar which is supposed to hold the meaning of life. After the monk leaves, the Ramadar only makes a grinding noise. The Man smashes it with the stool to find that inexplicably it is made of strawberry jam inside. Arnie comes in and cleans up the broken Ramadar stating that most people break their Ramadar. Arnie then leaves with the broken Ramadar and the broken stool. After six people bring in a coffin, the Man finds a gun is left in the room. Grabbing the gun, the man attempts to shoot himself and ink squirts onto his face.\n\nAll the people he had encountered enter and laugh at him as Arnie states that this is all a joke. Enraged, he tells them he's had enough with their tricks and that no matter what happens he knows he is real. The Man then leaves the Cube as the people applaud him. The Man is then escorted into an office so that the head of the organization can sign his release. Once there, the Man reflects on the revelation of his own realness. He accidentally cuts himself with a knife while demonstrating and is asked to taste his blood. He does so and discovers his blood is strawberry jam. The head of the organization and his office fade away to reveal the Man is still trapped in the cube.\n\nAs the credits roll, the Man wanders around the room one last time and then sits down on the floor apparently resigned to his fate of never getting out while the band's song is reprised in the background.\n\n\nSome elements of the plot bear a similarity to that of \"The Squirrel Cage\", a short story by Thomas M. Disch first published in 1966 in \"New Worlds\" magazine. Both stories are about a man who is imprisoned in a white cube, has no memory of a time before, and never discovers the purpose of his entrapment. The similarities end there as the man in \"The Squirrel Cage\" is never visited by others as is the man in \"The Cube\". He instead makes up stories, and regularly reads a newspaper that is provided for him daily.\n\nAt one point Henson comments on his own teleplay through a Professor who wanders in from yet another door:\n\nIn 2007, the German Fringe Theater troupe \"Glassbooth\" presented a live stage adaptation of \"The Cube\" titled \"KUBUS\", directed by Roger Hoffmann and starring Jens Dornheim.\n\nIn 2012, \"Tale of Sand\", a graphic novel co-written by Henson and Juhl, was released utilizing similar set pieces and sight gags. Although released long after \"The Cube\", the script for \"Tale of Sand\" actually predates it by several years.\n\n\n"}

A fishing town of the same name, Sok Kwu Wan, in the bay has a cluster of famous and well-reputed seafood restaurants near the ferry pier.\n\nThere is a Tin Hau Temple in Sok Kwu Wan with some old and interesting artifacts from the pre-Qing period. The Lamma Island Family Trail, a well-maintained path running from Sok Kwu Wan to Yung Shue Wan, connects the larger village on the North side of the island. There are several pagodas along the trail, as well as small information panels detailing aspects of the island's ecosystems and history. The trail is well-marked, with signs directing hikers to Luk Chau, Lamma Winds, Lo So Shing, and Tung O, as well as the villages on the North side of the island.\n\nPaths from the village's ferry pier leads to several beaches, some of which are overseen by Hong Kong Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the Agricultural, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD). Sham Wan, one of these beaches, is well known as a breeding location for endangered green sea turtles, and an AFCD facility on the beach is staffed from June to October in order to prevent access to the beach during breeding season. The Hong Kong YMCA maintains a small camp facility on the shore of the bay opposite from the village of Sok Kwu Wan, which sits on several acres of forested land that has been under consideration for status as protected land. The camp is used for outdoor youth education. The entirety of South Lamma has been suggested several times for conservation status under the auspices of AFCD. \nThe village, itself, has been the subject of some interesting debate concerning environmental protection and urban expansion. A planned community is under discussion to be developed at the site of Sok Kwu Wan's abandoned quarry. The development could house an anticipated additional 6,000 residents on the island, including an additional 1900 units with 700 reserved for subsidized housing, a 260 suite hotel, and facilities for water sports. Development plans were last reported to have been shelved until 2025. The site plans to preserve a green belt consisting of natural mudflats, a lake, and many acres of pristine woodlands. Locals voiced interest in a potential eco-tourism resort rather than large-scale residential development. Recent developments regarding the real estate development talks show that the development plans may be changed to environmentally protected areas on a large scale, which may provide some interesting opportunities for local small business. \n\nThe town is serviced by ferries from the Outlying Ferry Pier No. 4 in Central, taking 35 to 45 minutes, and from Aberdeen via Mo Tat by Chuen Kee Ferry, taking about 30 minutes. \n\n"}

Pollock tried, in April 1876, the unprecedented case of the Queen \"v\". Keyn, arising out of the sinking of the British vessel \"Strathclyde\" by the German steamship \"Franconia\". The collision occurred within three miles of the English coast, and Keyn, the master of the \"Franconia\", to whose culpable negligence-it was imputed, was indicted for manslaughter and found guilty. \nPollock deferred judgment pending the decision of the question of jurisdiction by the court for the consideration of crown cases reserved, and concurred with the majority of that court in quashing the conviction. \nHe took part in several other important decisions of the same tribunal. \nIn the \"St. Paul's reredos\" case in 1889 he differed from Lord Coleridge, and his judgment was sustained by both the court of appeal and the House of Lords. \nPollock was vice-president of the Rochester Diocesan Association, a member of the Commons' Preservation Society, and of the Board of Conservators of Wimbledon Common. \n\nHe died at his residence, The Croft, Putney, on 21 November 1897.\n\nHe married thrice : first, on 1 September 1848, Nicola Sophia, second daughter of the Rev.

Lovania Leuven is a Catholic academic fraternity, founded in 1896 at the Catholic University of Louvain in Leuven, Belgium. It is a German Studentenverbindung and is an affiliated member of the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen. Her motto is \"Semper Excelsius!\" (\"Der Geist lebt in uns allen!\"). Its official coulours (Couleur) are green, white and red.\n\nThe Old University of Leuvain, founded in 1425, was closed down during the occupation of the Low Countries in 1797 after the French revolutionaries occupied the country. After the defeat of the revolutionaries and Belgian independence from the Netherlands, the Catholic University of Louvain was founded in 1834 and was able to attract quite a number of Catholic students from Germany, Austria and Switzerland who were fleeing the Kulturkampf. \n\nAt first a Swiss Catholic student fraternity was founded, Helvetia Lovaniensis. It existed from 1872 to 1875. It was succeeded by an all German Catholic student fraternity, Tungria Lovaniensis, that existed from 1877 until 1879. In 1888 a regional student fraternity was founded by students from Luxemburg. Only the last fraternity survived. Out of the ashes of the demise of the Swiss and German fraternities, a new fraternity was founded. \n\nThis event was triggered by a public allocution of , a professor in thomistic philosophy at the university, on student life at Germanic universities on January 21, 1896. During his student years in Bonn, Thiéry had become a member of the prestigious student fraternity K.D.St. V. Bavaria Bonn, the oldest Catholic student fraternity in the world. This speech motivated a number of Germanic students to such an extent that they decided to establish a fraternity that same evening. It was called Lovania, which is Latin for Leuven (Louvain). The fraternity quickly expanded and Prof. Thiéry became honorary president. Lovania continued to blossom until the outbreak of the First World War. In 1914 the fraternity was suspended due to the commencement of fighting. At that moment the fraternity already had more than 160 active and inactive members. Numerous members died on both sides of the war.\n\nIn post war Belgium it was impossible to re-establish a German student fraternity in 1918. Promising efforts were made during 1927 and 1928 but failed after a short period of time. The Second World War made a quick re-establishment even more impossible. It took until 1996 until the political situation was stable enough to reconstitute the fraternity, within the Dutch-speaking Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven. At that moment many students who belonged to fraternities were members of the Cartellverband and studied in Louvain. The idea then arose to re-establish the fraternity. The last surviving member gave his blessing to this undertaking and on April 19, 1996 the reactivation became a reality. In 1999 the friendly affiliation to the Cartellverband was formally re-established. Today the fraternity flourishes and has 137 members to date, originating from Flanders, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.\n\nLovania is founded upon three guiding principles:\n\nThe members of Lovania do not practice academic fencing (Mensur) because it is forbidden by the Roman Catholic Church. Academic fencing is common with the more secular student fraternities that already existed in Germanic countries. Due to this restriction, Catholic students had to organize themselves in separate fraternities. Lovania only accepts men into the organization.\n\nThe fraternity has a legislative (the power to make laws), executive (the power to implement laws) and judiciary (the power to judge and apply punishment when laws are broken) body. All full members make up the legislative body, which elects the executive body. The legislative body also functions as a judiciary body. In this case it assumes the function of an honorary senate.\n\nThe official dress symbols, that are worn by each member, consist of a vertical green-white-red triband bordered with a golden thread and a green kepi, the historical military cap as worn during the American Civil War.\n\nDuring official ceremonies and special occasions, the praesidium wears a dress uniform, a traditional Polish military uniform called a Vollwichs which consists mainly of a bekiesza.\n\n\n\n"}

The earliest printed version of \"I Saw Three Ships\" is from the 17th century, possibly Derbyshire, and was also published by William Sandys in 1833.\n\nThe lyrics mention the ships sailing into Bethlehem, but the nearest body of water is the Dead Sea about away. The reference to three ships is thought to originate in the three ships that bore the purported relics of the Biblical magi to Cologne Cathedral in the 12th century. Another possible reference is to Wenceslaus II, King of Bohemia, who bore a coat of arms \"Azure three galleys argent\". Another suggestion is that the ships are actually the camels used by the Magi, as camels are frequently referred to as \"ships of the desert\".\n\nAn arrangement by Martin Shaw appears in the \"Oxford Book of Carols\". The \"Carols for Choirs\" series of carol books features arrangements of the carol by both Sir David Willcocks and John Rutter. Organist Simon Preston and former conductor of the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, Sir Philip Ledger, have also written arrangements that the choir have performed at the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols in recent years. This carol is also featured in the musical \"Caroline, or Change\", but as a counterpoint. Adapted by Jon Schmidt on \"Jon Schmidt Christmas\" album. John Renbourn has arranged it (in a rather free adaptation) for guitar. The song appears on Nat King Cole's 1960 album \"The Magic of Christmas\" (l/k/a \"The Christmas Song\"), arranged by Ralph Carmichael.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"Living King Yama\", he ranks 31st among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.\n\nThe novel depicts Ruan Xiaoqi as having bulging eyes, pale yellow whiskers and dark patches on his skin, which make him look like a fearsome bronze statue. As this image is similar to that of the ruler of Hell in Chinese mythology, he is nicknamed \"Living King Yama\".\n\nRuan Xiaoqi is the youngest of the three Ruan brothers (his seniors being Ruan Xiaoer and Ruan Xiaowu). They live in Shijie Village (石碣村; in present-day Liangshan County, Shandong), where they make a living by fishing in waters near the Liangshan Marsh. Like his brothers, Ruan Xiaoqi is a good swimmer and fights well under water.\n\nWu Yong recommends involving the three Ruan brothers when Chao Gai, headman of Dongxi village in Yuncheng County, seeks his advice on whether to hijack valuables in transportation to the Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing. Visiting the Ruans in Shijie Village, Wu claims that he has come to buy some fish before proceeding to find out whether they are receptive to the bold proposal. Ruan Xiaoer, the oldest of the three, senses Wu is up to something else while the other two brothers, being less astute, are not suspicious. Nevertheless all three are unhappy with their poverty and resent being bullied by officials. So when Wu Yong comes to his point, they unanimously accept the invitation. The robbers, numbering seven including Liu Tang and Gongsun Sheng and with the help of Bai Sheng, who poses as a wine seller, succeed in seizing the valuables at the Yellow Mud Ridge by drugging the escorts of the gifts led by Yang Zhi. \n\nBut the authorities soon track down essential clues and an arrest party is sent to seize Chao Gai at his house. Chao, Wu Yong, Gongsun Sheng and Liu Tang flee to Shijie village. The Ruan brothers, familiar with the surrounding waters, lure the soldiers who have come for them into the waterways and wipe them out. The seven men then seek refuge in the bandit stronghold of Liangshan Marsh. \n\nWang Lun, the leader of Liangshan, tries to send them away with gifts fearing that they might usurp his position. Wu Yong, sensing Lin Chong's unhappiness with Wang, instigates him to kill the leader. Chao Gai is then elected the new chief of Liangshan, with Ruan Xiaoqi taking the eighth position. The Ruan brothers are appointed commanders of the Liangshan flotilla.\n\nWhen Guan Sheng leads an imperial force to attack Liangshan, Zhang Heng launches a raid on his camp with a small band without informing any of the chieftains except Ruan Xiaoqi. He is ambushed and captured. Ruan takes some men to rescue him but is also seized. Both are freed after Guan Sheng defects to Liangshan.\n\nRuan Xiaoqi is appointed as one of the commanders of Liangshan's flotilla after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan.\n\nRuan Xiaoqi's two elder brothers are killed in the campaign against Fang La. When Fang's palace falls, Ruan Xiaoqi finds the crown and the dragon robe of the rebel leader, which are symbols of an emperor, and puts them on out of mischief. He is reprimanded by Song Jiang for the lese majeste offence.\n\nBack in Dongjing the remaining Liangshan heroes are each conferred a position. When it comes Ruan Xiaoqi's turn, Grand Marshal Gao Qiu and Grand Tutor Cai Jing raise objection citing his offence of putting on Fang La‘s \"illegal\" articles. Although Ruan Xiaoqi is let off on account of his service, he receives no reward. He goes back to Shijie Village where he lives happily to the age of 70.\nIn Peking Opera \"A Fisherman Kills A Family\", part of \"The Qing Ding Pearl\" routine, Ruan Xiaoqi moved to the region of Lake Tai upon retirement from his military career, adopting the name Xiao En to avoid detection by his former enemies. Xiao En and his daughter became involved in a conflict against a local mafia boss; the father-daughter duo killed the mafia boss and went once again into pseudonymous exile.\n\n"}

The road tunnel, which forms an important part of the HK$15 billion Route 8, linking Tsing Yi and Sha Tin in the city, began construction since 2003 and was completed in 2007.\n\nThe twin-tube tunnel, built by the Highways Department of the Government of Hong Kong, is long and has three lanes in either direction in the southern part of Tsing Yi from Sai Tso Wan to Nam Wan Kok. It provides linkage between the eastern part of the New Territories and Hong Kong International Airport. The tunnel is toll-free.\n\nThe twin tunnels are wide with 12 cross-passages and emergency walkways, and a portal building at each end. They were formed by blasting through granite and volcanic rocks.\n\nThe tunnel cross section is in the form of an arch. The approximate height and width of the arch is 11.2m and 15.3m respectively. The geology comprises coarse volcanic ash tuff on the west side and medium grained granite on the eastern side. Both of these lithologies are intruded by Rhyolite dykes together with some porphyrytic granite and occasional basalt dykes.\n\nThe two tubes were constructed using the drill/blast method. Temporary support for the tunnels have been provided by rock-bolts. Permanent supports have been provided by a concrete lining of varying thickness depending upon the stability of the ground.\n\nThree main types of support have been used: 400mm un-reinforced, 500mm un-reinforced, and 600mm reinforced.\n\nNearly all of the of tunnel spoil will be reused in the Penny's Bay reclamation project or processed into aggregates at a local quarry. Spoil was taken away by a fleet of trucks, one leaving the site every 100 seconds during the working day from 8am to 7pm.\n\nEnvironmental measures taken to minimise noise and nuisance to road users and the public included: a 7.5m-tall noise barrier, and continuous monitoring to ensure noise and vibration limits are not exceeded during tunnel blasting; blast doors for any blasting conducted near roads; and 40 water sprinklers and washing facilities at all exits for vehicles to use before leaving the construction site.\n\nArup Group were the designers of the tunnel and a joint venture of Gammon Construction and Skanska were the main construction contractors (contract was awarded in January 2003).\n\nThe contract also covered construction of tunnel control buildings and the dual three-lane West Tsing Yi Viaduct.\n\nThe cost for the tunnel has been estimated at HK$470m (civil works) and HK$83 million (electrical and mechanical systems). Fläkt Woods provided the ventilation system for the tunnel.\n\nCOWI has provided specialist assistance to Ove Arup and Partners with the design of electrical and mechanical systems for the Nam Wan Tunnel and two adjoining viaducts.\n\nFläkt Woods provided the ventilation solutions by supplying three immense fans for the tunnel. The axial flow fans measured 2.65 m in diameter, were powered by 900 kW motors and ran at pressures of 3,800 Pa.\n\nFläkt Woods ran one of the fans continuously to self-destruct, to prove their capability of withstanding temperatures of up to 400 °C for one hour. The fans incorporated guide vanes for flow straightening to achieve maximum performance and ran at 995 RPM.\n\nIn the preliminary design phase of the tunnel COWI established an overall concept for the electrical and mechanical systems with emphasis on safety-related functions such as electric power supply, tunnel lighting, fire fighting, tunnel ventilation and smoke extraction. This overall concept was used as a basis for the detailed design.\n\nLater in the project COWI reviewed the client's detailed design of electrical and mechanical systems.\n\nThe electrical and mechanical systems included the following: medium- and low-voltage distribution (11 kV/0.4 kV); reliable power supply based on UPS and diesel generators; tunnel lighting and road lighting; lighting in portal buildings, technical rooms and cross passages between tunnels; Central Monitoring and Control System (CMCS); fire detection system; public mobile communication system; fire fighting equipment, including fire water booster pumps, hydrants and portable extinguishers; tunnel ventilation for normal operation, congested operation and emergency situations (smoke control); smoke extraction system; pressurised air supply; HVAC and plumbing in portal buildings.\n\nPrior to its formal commissioning, a Community Chest Walk for Millions was held on 15 November 2009 to allow the public to walk across Stonecutters Bridge and East Tsing Yi Viaduct and through Nam Wan Tunnel. Over 30,000 participants took part, raising more than HK$10 million for the charity's Children and Youth Services.\n"}

Homeowners may employ the services of marketing or online listing companies or market their own property. Typically, they represent themselves with the help of a lawyer or solicitor throughout the sale, as in most areas, there are detailed legal requirements pertaining to sellers and disclosures they must make.\n\nSome options available to the FSBO seller include: \n\nIn the USA, the popularity of FSBO seems to be increasing, with real estate website Zillow reporting a doubling of listings between 2012 and 2014 (up to 4%). ForSaleByOwner.com saw 24% growth in 2013, and StreetEasy reports that New York City FSBO listings increased by nearly 30% in that same period. The record percentage of 20% of US real estate transactions (since tracking started in 1981) took place in 1987. According to a 2016 report by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) regarding home buyer and seller trends, \"Home Buyer and Seller Generational Trends Report 2016\", 8% of surveyed real estate transactions between July 2014 and June 2015 were FSBO. The NAR's 2015 report found that the median age for FSBO sellers in the United States is 54 years. 77% of FSBO sales were by married couples that have a median income of $104,100. FSBO homes typically sold more quickly than agent-assisted homes; 67% of them being completed in less than two weeks. Of sellers who personally knew the buyer, 71% were satisfied with the process of selling their home.\n\nSome critics of the National Association of Realtors' report believe those statistics may be misleading and suggest that the true size of the U.S. They claim that the FSBO market is higher than these numbers suggest, because flat-fee MLS now makes up 10% of transactions. They argue that flat-fee MLS sellers are in effect FSBO sellers.\n\nSeparate reports from the Canadian Real Estate Association and CTV Consumer Reports state that between 20% and 25% of homes in Canada are not sold through brokers each year (as of 2004). MSN Money suggested in 2009 that 30% of homes are sold without using a real estate agent. In that same year, more than half of the homes sold in Quebec were sold without an agent.\n\nIn the UK, the average commission rate is significantly lower than in Canada or the US, meaning that FSBO is less common. By law, all sales of property must be supervised and handled by an independent solicitor, who acts as a mediator and holds the buyer's money until the purchase is complete.\n\nIn Australia, FSBO is still relatively niche market. As of 2014, privately sold houses in Canberra spent about 34 days on the market, according to RP Data – the second shortest period in the country. Canberra houses sold by private treaty spent the same time on the market as those in Melbourne; a week longer than Sydney, where houses are on the market for an average of 27 days. Privately sold units in Canberra spend an average of 54 days on the market, third only to Sydney (23 days) and Melbourne (37 days) when compared with other capital cities.\n\n\n15.

It is a regional council affiliated with the mainstream ecumenical movement which also gave birth to the World Council of Churches, of which the MECC is also a member.\n\nThe MECC is headed by a Secretary General and supported by three Associate Secretaries General. Its four co-presidents each represent the four church families.\n\nThe MECC is composed of two program categories: Core Programs and Service Programs.\n\nThe MECC has offices in Cairo and Amman, with liaison offices in Damascus, Jerusalem and Tehran. Through the membership of its four Church families, the MECC works in over 14 countries from Northern Africa, the Levant, Iraq, Iran and the Persian Gulf, representing 14 million Christians.\n\nThe MECC was founded in May 1974 at its first General Assembly in Nicosia, Cyprus with the stated purpose to \"deepen the spiritual fellowship among the churches of the Middle East, and to unite them in word and deed.\" From the outset, the MECC adopted the model of \"families of churches\". The Eastern Orthodox, the Oriental Orthodox and the Protestants were the three founding families. In 1990 the Catholic Churches (Latin and Oriental rite) joined the council, constituting the Catholic family within the MECC. Each family is equally represented in the governing bodies and the general assembly, and decides on its own representation. The MECC initially had three co-presidents, representing each of the Christian \"families\", becoming four after the Catholic Churches joined in 1990.\n\nThe first Secretary General of the MECC from 1974 to 1977 was the Reverend Albert Istero. He was succeeded by Gabriel Habib, from 1977 to 1994. In November 1994, the Reverend Dr. Riad Jarjour was elected Secretary General. He was replaced after two terms by Guirgis Saleh, a Coptic Orthodox theologian and professor, at the Eighth General Assembly in 2003 and served until 2011, at which point Father Boulos Rouhana, of the Maronite Church, was appointed. The term of Father Boulos Rouhana was cut short when he was appointed to the position of Bishop in the Maronite Church. Following a transitional period, Father Dr. Michel Jalakh, also of the Maronite Church, was elected by the Executive committee in 2013 to serve as the sixth Secretary General of the Middle East Council of Churches.\n\nThe MECC is composed of four ecclesiastical families, together representing 14 million Christians in the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core programs of the MECC are those which directly contribute to its well-being and vision.\n\n\nThe MECC serves as a bridge among Eastern Christians in the region. Its ecumenical relations program is deals with issues of Christian unity.\n\n\nMECC works with other religions in the region in its inter-religious relations program. It has historically been actively involved in Christian Muslim dialogue.\n\n\nThe Communications Program is responsible for MECC publications. In the past it has published reports in three different languages: Arabic, French, and English.\n\n\nThe documentation and archive program makes historical and academic resources regarding the ecumenical movement in the Middle East available as a reference for ecumenical studies and research in order to preserve the historical memory of the ecumenical movement in the Middle East.\n\nThrough its affiliated departments, the MECC is involved in humanitarian response and development work.\n\n\nThe MECC Diakonia and Social Justice (DSJ) unit focuses on the protection and rights of migrants and refugees, specifically women and children, and their rights, life and dignity.\n\n\nThe Inter-church Network for Development and Relief was founded in 1975 to respond to the needs across Lebanon. It is financially and administratively autonomous from the MECC. It provides psychosocial support, rights education and protection for children in Lebanon; psychosocial support for Syrian refugee women and children in Lebanon; and a food security program in Lebanon.\n\n\nThe Syrian IDPs program is a direct response to the war in Syria. The program, which is administered by the MECC Syria Office, distributes humanitarian assistance and rehabilitates water systems in schools to restore access to water and sanitation.\n\n\nThe Iraqi & Syrian Refugees Program is a program of the MECC Jordan office. It offers humanitarian aid as well as community development projects to Iraqi and Syrian refugees living in Jordan.\n\n\nThe Department of Services for Palestinian refugees was formed in 1951 to respond to the humanitarian crisis caused by the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It has evolved into an organization which works in the West Bank, Gaza, Nazareth, Lebanon, Jordan.\n\nChristian Zionists, who have long represented a fragment of historic and contemporary Protestants, are characterised as those \"distort the interpretation of the Word of God\" and \"damage intra-Christian relations\".\n\n"}

Taylor \"for their pioneering investigations concerning deep inelastic scattering of electrons on protons and bound neutrons, which have been of essential importance for the development of the quark model in particle physics.\"\n\nKendall was born in Boston to Evelyn Way and Henry P. Kendall, an industrialist. Kendall grew up in Sharon, Massachusetts and attended Deerfield Academy. He enrolled in the U. S. Merchant Marine Academy in 1945, and served on a troop transport on the North Atlantic in the winter of 1945 - 1946.\n\nIn 1946, he enrolled at Amherst College where he majored in mathematics, graduating in 1950. While at Amherst, he operated a diving and marine salvage company during two summers. He co-authored two books, one on shallow water diving and the other on underwater photography.\n\nHe did graduate research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, involving an experimental study of positronium, and he obtained his PhD in 1955. He then spent the next two years as a postdoctoral fellow at Brookhaven National Laboratory. He then spent five years in Robert Hofstadter's research group at Stanford University in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where he worked with Jerome Friedman and Richard Taylor, studying the structure of protons and neutrons, using the university's 300 feet long linear electron accelerator. He developed a close working relationship with Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky at Stanford.\n\nHe then returned to the MIT Physics Department, where he remained for the rest of his life.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kendall worked in collaboration with researchers at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) including Friedman and Taylor. These experiments involved scattering high-energy beams of electrons from protons and deuterons and heavier nuclei. At lower energies, it had already been found that the electrons would only be scattered through low angles, consistent with the idea that the nucleons had no internal structure. However, the SLAC-MIT experiments showed that higher energy electrons could be scattered through much higher angles, with the loss of some energy. These deep inelastic scattering results provided the first experimental evidence that the protons and neutrons were made up of point-like particles, later identified to be the up and down quarks that had previously been proposed on theoretical grounds. The experiments also provided the first evidence for the existence of gluons.\n\nKendall was not only a very accomplished physicist, but also a very skilled mountaineer and photographer. He did extensive rock climbing in Yosemite Valley, followed by expeditions to the Andes, Himalaya and Antarctica, photographing his experiences with large format cameras. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982. On April 7, 2012, the American Alpine Club inducted Kendall into its Hall of Mountaineering Excellence at an award ceremony in Golden, Colorado.\n\nKendall was one of the founding members of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in 1969. He served as Chairman of the UCS from 1974 until his death in 1999. His public policy interests included avoiding nuclear war, the Strategic Defense Initiative, the B2 bomber, nuclear reactor safety and global warming.\n\nHe was also a member of the JASON Defense Advisory Group.\n\nKendall died while diving the cave at the Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park, Florida as a part of the Wakulla 2 Project. He by-passed two pre-dive checklists for his Cis-Lunar MK-5P Mixed Gas rebreather and entered the spring basin without his dive buddy from the National Geographic Society. Kendall missed turning on the oxygen supply to his rebreather and lost consciousness and drowned. The autopsy revealed a physiological issue that led to his disregarding the protocols.\n\n \n"}

Established in 1882, the club played in the Lancashire League, Lancashire Combination and Central League before becoming founder members of the Third Division North of the Football League in 1921. They were Division Three North champions in 1922–23 and were promoted to Division Two. However, they were relegated back to the Third Division North after a single season.\n\nIn 1931 the club lost their Football League status and dropped back into the Lancashire Combination, where they played until folding in 1936. They were reformed after World War II and rejoined the Lancashire Combination, playing in the league until it merged to form the North West Counties League in 1982. They dropped out of the league between 1988 and 1992, playing in the West Lancashire League. Although the club left the league again in 2010, they returned the following year, and are currently members of the , playing home matches at Victoria Park.\n\nOn 21 October 1882, members of Nelson Cricket Club travelled to Burnley to watch a football match between the recently formed Burnley Football Club and Blackburn Rovers' second team. The match, played at Burnley's Calder Vale ground, ended with Blackburn winning 10–0 and inspired the cricketers to form a football club of their own. A meeting was held on the following Monday 23 October at the Victoria Hall on Scotland Road; John Greenwood presided over the meeting and enrolled around 25 members to the newly formed Nelson Football Club.\n\nNelson were founder members of the Lancashire League in the 1889–90 season, finishing in 4th place. They were Lancashire League champions in 1895–96, winning 22 out of 30 games, scoring 105 goals, and runners-up two seasons later in 1897–98. However, the club folded during the 1898–99 season and their record for that season expunged when they were expelled by the Lancashire FA. They rejoined the Lancashire League in the 1900–01 season, finishing 6th. In 1901–02 they joined the Lancashire Combination. In 1903–04 the league expanded with two divisions, and Nelson played in Division One. However, after finishing 18th in 1906–07 they were relegated to Division Two, where they stayed for just one season before being promoted back to Division One. The club closed down in 1916, when bailiffs were called in they remained closed during World War I until they reformed in 1918 joining the Central League in 1919–20 where they stayed for just two seasons.\n\nIn 1921, the club joined the Football League as a founder member of the Third Division North. Their first league game, a 2–1 defeat to the now-defunct Wigan Borough attracted a record attendance of 9,000 on 27 August 1921. And their first season in the Football League, 1921–22, ended with a 16th-place finish, although they struggled with comparatively low attendances.\n\nThe following season, 1922–23, proved to be the most successful in the club's history, when they finished as champions of the Third Division North, earning promotion on 24 April 1923 with a 2–0 home win over Wrexham and were promoted to the Second Division, the first and only time the club played in a national league. In preparation for the new season in the Second Division the club went on a pre-season tour to Spain in the summer of 1923, winning two of their games, beating Real Oviedo 2–1 and Real Madrid 4–2 making them the first English team to beat Real Madrid in Spain. Their stay in the Second Division was short-lived as they finished 21st (out of 22) in 1923–24 and were relegated back to the Third Division North. They were though the first team to score at high-flying Blackpool and also beat eventual champions Leeds United at home. They struggled though all season with their first away win not coming until March when they beat Manchester United. The following season they finished as runners-up to Darlington on their return to the Third Division North, but it was to be the last time the club seriously threatened to gain promotion back to a nationwide league.\n\nJimmy Hampson played for Nelson between 1926 and 1927. On 10 April 1926 a record attendance of 14,143 at Seedhill, saw a 2–2 draw with Bradford Park Avenue. For a town with a population of under 40,000 the attendance were considered impressive. They reached the second round of the FA Cup in 1926–27, beating Stockport County at home 4–1 in the first round, before losing 2–1 away to Ashington in the second round. That season they finished 5th, however the club then started to struggle in the league and finished in last place in 1927–28, conceding 135 goals, and they were also struggling financially and found themselves £6,500 in debt. They were though re-elected to the league. In 1930–31 they reached the second round of the FA Cup for a second time. In the first round they beat Workington 4–0 then lost 2–1 to York City in a replay after a 1–1 draw. However, they again struggled in the league, dropping to last place on Boxing Day 1930, where they stayed for the rest of the season. After finishing bottom of the league for a second time, they failed to win re-election and were voted out of the Football League after a second vote, following a tie. They were replaced by Chester City. The club's last game in the Football League was a 4–0 defeat to Hull City on 2 May 1931. The club then dropped back into the Lancashire Combination where on 7 August 1936 they folded again after incurring a big loss. Hastily reformed as Nelson Town, the \"new\" club entered the local Nelson & Colne League in time for the 1936–7 season and duly lost their first fixture at Seedhill against James Nelson SC 3–2. After completing two seasons in local football the club announced after their final game at Gargrave in 1939 that the following season would see them return to senior football in the West Lancashire League. Sadly only two games were played before events in Europe dictated a seven-year absence of League football in Nelson.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the club was reformed in 1946, and immediately rejoined the Lancashire Combination finishing 11th in 1946–47. The following season they were runners-up and for the next few seasons the club continued to do well both in the Lancashire Combination and cup competitions. A 4th-placed finish in 1947–48 was followed by the club being crowned champions in 1949–50, scoring 125 league goals, when they also won the Lancashire Combination Cup. They were runners-up in 1950–51, when they lost out on the title on goal-average, while scoring 120 goals. Also in 1950–51, Nelson won the Lancashire Combination Cup again and reached the second round of the FA Cup. Although the first time the club did so a non-league club, meaning they started the competition in the first qualifying round where they beat Lancaster City 5–2. They then beat Leyland Motors 4–1 in the second qualifying round, followed by victories over Bacup Borough (2–0 in the third qualifying round) and Hyde United (3–0 in a replay in the fourth qualifying round). In the first round they beat Witton Albion 1–0 before losing 3–2 to Port Vale in the second round. In 1951–52 they were champions for a second time, this time scoring 139 goals with Joe Fagan, who went on to manage Liverpool, as manager. A 5th-place finish in 1952–53, Fagan's second and final season in charge, was followed by a 3rd place in 1953–54. However, despite finishing as champions twice, each time they applied to re-join the Football League they narrowly failed. In 1954–55 they won the Lancashire FA Challenge Trophy. They won the Lancashire Combination Cup for a third time in 1959–60. In 1960–61 they were runners-up in the Combination, the closest the club came to winning the title again. However, in 1965–66 they finished 21st (out of 22) and were relegated to Division Two. The Lancashire Combination lost many of its clubs to the newly formed Northern Premier League in 1968. However, Nelson remained in the Combination. In their final season in the Combination, 1981–82, they finished 3rd.\n\nNelson became founder members of the new North West Counties Football League, joining the Third Division. They finished 10th (out of 18) in their first season, 1982–83. The 1986–87 season saw a 4th-placed finish. The following season the Third Division was scrapped, and Nelson were moved up to the Second Division, finishing in 16th. However, due to the poor state of their Victoria Park stadium, and problems with getting it up to the standard required by the league, the club were forced to drop down to the West Lancashire League, where they played in the Second Division and remained for four seasons from 1988–89 to 1991–92. They struggled though with a highest place finish of 15th. They were re-admitted to the North West Counties Second Division for the 1992–93 season after Victoria Park was upgraded, although they finished 17th (out of 18) in their first season. In 1996–97 they won the Division Two Trophy. In 1999–2000 they finished 3rd. In 2000–01 they finished in the third and final promotion place on the final day of the season above Atherton Laburnum Rovers. However, Atherton were granted a replay of their final game as their opponents had fielded an ineligible player. Atherton won the replayed game to snatch away third spot from Nelson. In 2005–06 they again finished 3rd and were promoted to the First Division, the club's first promotion in 83 years.\n\nThey finished 20th (out of 22) in 2006–07 and 20th (out of 20) in 2007–08 although they were not relegated. In 2008–09 the First Division was renamed the Premier Division; Nelson finished in 17th position out of 22 despite winning just three home games, The Blues fared much better on the road to finish 16 points clear of bottom club Atherton Collieries. On 15 July 2010, the North West Counties League announced that Nelson had resigned from the league with immediate effect. Nelson F.C. continued to operate junior teams, however, and made an application to rejoin the North West Counties League for the 2011–12 season, which was later approved by the FA.\nMark Fell was appointed 1st team manager in November 2012 after Michael Morrison and Robert Grimes were sacked. Fell led the side to 10th in the NWCFL. In Fell's first full season in charge, Nelson were crowned champions of the NWCFL Division One, being promoted to the Premier Division in the process.\n\nNelson originally played its home matches on a pitch behind the Golden Ball pub moving to the Park Ground by the 1890s. They moved to Seedhill around 1905 where the club had a small wooden stand and a small covered enclosure behind one goal, with grass banking around the rest of the ground. In 1922 a large 2,000 capacity wooden stand was built. The club's highest attendance at the stadium was 14,143 for a Third Division North match at home Bradford Park Avenue on 10 April 1926.\n\nNelson played their final home game at Seedhill on Sunday 28 March 1971 when a crowd of over a thousand gathered to witness the first Sunday fixture at the stadium. They were duly rewarded with an eight-goal thriller as Clitheroe were beaten 5–3. Seedhill, having hosted the Nelson Admirals speedway team between 1967 and 1969, latterly became a well known stock car venue before its eventual demolition around 1980 when the M65 motorway cut through the area. The site of Seedhill remains clearly visible today.\n\nNelson moved to Victoria Park (known locally as \"Little Wembley\") in time for their opening home fixture of the following 1971–72 Lancashire Combination season, when the Nelson Leader reported a \"good crowd\" attended to see them lose 1–0 to the recently reformed Accrington Stanley on 28 August 1971. Victoria Park now has a capacity of 2,000, with 1,700 standing. It is bordered by trees on two sides in surrounding parkland. Along one side there is a low-roofed wooden stand with seating in the centre section. The side opposite has the dugouts with a grass area.

He has played with Damon Albarn on tour with his bands Blur and Gorillaz, and as a member of the Good, the Bad & the Queen. He ranks in BBC's \"The Axe Factor\" as the 40th greatest guitarist of the last 30 years.\n\nTong grew up in English town Skelmersdale, the subject of his most recent release, \"Prospect of Skelmersdale\" with his project The Magnetic North.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1999, Simon was a guitarist and keyboardist for The Verve. He was brought in to replace lead guitarist Nick McCabe after the band's first short-lived split, but remained with them when McCabe returned. Their third album was 1997's highly acclaimed \"Urban Hymns\". He played on many of their hits from that time such as \"The Drugs Don't Work\", \"Bittersweet Symphony\" and \"Sonnet\". The Verve disbanded in 1999 and later reformed in 2007, this time without Tong. By 2009 they had disbanded again.\n\nAfter The Verve disbanded, Tong and Simon Jones (The Verve) were members of short lived band The Shining from 2002 to 2003.\n\nFollowing Graham Coxon's departure from Blur in 2002, Tong was recruited as the guitarist for the band's live performances in support of the album \"Think Tank\" (2003). He continued the relationship formed with frontman Damon Albarn by contributing guitar to Gorillaz' 2005 album \"Demon Days\" and playing guitar in the Gorillaz live band for the Demon Days Live performances. Tong also contributed guitar to Gorillaz' 2010 album \"Plastic Beach\" and substituted for lead guitarist Jeff Wooton on certain dates of the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour.\n\nIn July 2006, it was reported that Tong would again be working with Damon Albarn. NME reported that Albarn had foregone plans to record a solo album and instead formed a new group The Good, the Bad & the Queen, which featured Tong with Albarn, former Clash bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Tony Allen. The band released their self titled debut studio album on 23 January 2007, with the single \"Herculean\" in October 2006. The album enjoyed very good reviews and a second single, \"Kingdom of Doom\", was also released in January 2007 as part of their pan European tour.\n\nThe band was active again after a decade, releasing their second album, \"Merrie Land\" on 16 November 2018, which was supported by a 2019 tour, and a short tour in the December of 2018.\n\nSimon Tong co-created The Magnetic North with Erland Cooper of Erland and the Carnival, and Hannah Peel of John Foxx and the Maths. They originally planned on only releasing one album in 2012, \"Orkney: Symphony of the Magnetic North\", but due to its popularity reconvened to release follow-up \"Prospect of Skelmersdale\" in 2016, a concept album about Tong's Transcendentalist hometown, Skelmersdale.\n\nTong also set up a record label with Youth (of Killing Joke) called Butterfly Recordings. The first acts to be released are Indigo Moss and Duke Garwood along with a compilation entitled \"What the Folk\".\n\nIn 2012 Simon contributed to the recording of the Dr Dee soundtrack, written by Damon Albarn, which was released on 7 May 2012.\n\nHe is a member of the band Transmission with Youth, Paul Ferguson (of Killing Joke) and Tim Bran (of Dreadzone) which has released a single called \"Noctolucent\" and an album \"Beyond Light\" in 2006. He has also played guitar on several tracks on the 2007 Client album \"Heartland\". He is also recording and performing as a member of heavy-weight folk rock band Erland and the Carnival.\n\n"}

In 1975, a Neolithic stilt house village located on the northern shore of the Lake Greifen area called \"Böschen\" was discovered by recreational divers. Initially, they found ceramics, lavishly decorated pots and bowls, and simple, large food tanks. In scientific dives, the remains of a village with 24 huts have been revealed. The excellent condition of the timber relicts allows dendrochronological dating to the year 1051 B.C. Weaving spindles made of clay, tools, needles and fishing hooks from bronze, charred wild apples and cereals have been conserved. Ten years after its construction, the settlement was destroyed by a fire and not rebuilt. For the subsequent years, in the canton of Zürich various archaeological relicts have been found, such as heavy bronze bracelets, glass, mainly bronze fibulas and flint blades probably from the Mediterranean and France. Relicts dating to the Roman period have been found in neighbouring municipalities, in Riedikon (Uster), and about nine kilometers away near Pfäffikon ZH located at Lake Pfäffikon (Irgenhausen Castrum).\n\nProbably in the late 12th century, a tower house (later Castle of Greifensee) was built at the location of a small village, estimated to be a settlement by the Counts of Rapperswil. On April 29, 1260, «\"R. et H. minstri de Grifense\"» are mentioned. \nGreifensee was a bailiwick (\"Landvogtei, Amt\"), of Rapperswil, of Toggenburg and of Zürich, during 1300–1798.\nOn January 7, 1300, Greifensee was given by Elisabeth von Rapperswil-Habsburg-Laufenburg, the sister of Rudolf V, Count of Rapperswil, to the nobleman Hermann II of Landenberg. \nHis son, Hermann IV (the younger Marshal), fortified the small town, Greifensee castle and the city walls. He donated, for his salvation and on his wife's favour, the Gallus Chapel around 1330–1340, Greifensee's former Parish church, too.\n\nIn 1369, the \"Amt\" of Greifensee was sold to Count Friedrich Donat Diethelm of Toggenburg; in early 1402, Friedrich VII sold it to the city of Zürich, and beginning in 1419, Greifensee is the first country bailiwick of the city of Zürich.\n\nIn May 1444, during the Old Zürich War, the Old Swiss Confederacy laid siege to Greifensee which was held by about 70 defenders, most of them inhabitants of the \"Amt\" Greifensee with a few Habsburg and Zürich soldiers. The town was captured after four weeks, on May 27, and all but two of the surviving 64 defenders were beheaded on the next day, including the leader, Wildhans von \"Breitenlandenberg\". Breitenlandenberg's body was brought to his family, the bodies of the other surrenders were buried at the Uster church. Even in times of war, mass execution was widely considered a cruel and unjust deed. On May 29, the Castle of Greifensee and the city walls were broken.\n\nIn the year 1520, Zürich decided to reconstruct the ruins as residence of Zürich's \"Landvögte\" among them Heinrich Biberli (1403), Gerold Edlibach (1504) and Salomon Landolt (1776). \n\nThe canting coat of arms (or, a griffin rampant gules) dates to the 15th century, replacing \nthe older Landenberg arms of party per cross or and sable. It was adopted as municipal coat of arms in 1930.\n\nGreifensee has an area of . Of this area, 37.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while 11.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 44.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (6.4%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). housing and buildings made up 37.8% of the total area, while transportation infrastructure made up the rest (6.5%). Of the total unproductive area, water (streams and lakes) made up 0% of the area. 37.5% of the total municipal area was undergoing some type of construction.\n\nIt is located on the lake Greifensee, approximately to the east of Zürich in Switzerland. The town has a historic part complete with a castle and a unique church (Gallus Chapel) which was shaped as a triangle so it could fit into the city walls.\n\nGreifensee has a population (as of ) of . , 15.2% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. the gender distribution of the population was 49.2% male and 50.8% female. Over the last 10 years the population has decreased at a rate of -0.2%. Most of the population () speaks German (88.3%), with French being second most common ( 1.7%) and Italian being third ( 1.5%).\n\nIn the 2007 election the most popular party was the SVP which received 25.6% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SPS (21%), the FDP (15%) and the CSP (13%).\n\nThe age distribution of the population () is children and teenagers (0–19 years old) make up 25.3% of the population, while adults (20–64 years old) make up 65% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 9.7%. The entire Swiss population is generally well educated. In Greifensee about 85.5% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a \"Fachhochschule\"). There are 2198 households in Greifensee.\n\nThe historical population is given in the following table:\nLocated on \"Greifensee\" lakeshore, Greifensee–Storen–Wildsberg is part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps\", and the settlement is also listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a \"Class object\".

It may be used by itself or with other antiseizure medications such as valproic acid. Ethosuximide is taken by mouth.\nSide effects are generally minimal. Common side effects include loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and feeling tired. Serious side effects include suicidal thoughts, low blood cell levels, and lupus erythematosus. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or under the age of three is safe for the baby. Ethosuximide is in the succinimide family of medications. How exactly it works is unclear.\nEthosuximide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ethosuximide is available as a generic medication. As of 2008 it was generally affordable in most areas of the world. As of 2019 its availability was limited in many countries with concerns of price fixing in the United States.\nIt is approved for absence seizures. Ethosuximide is considered the first choice drug for treating absence seizures in part because it lacks the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of the alternative anti-absence drug, valproic acid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The following can occur with or without bone marrow loss:\"\n\n\n\nValproates can either decrease or increase the levels of ethosuximide; however, combinations of valproates and ethosuximide had a greater protective index than either drug alone.\n\nIt may elevate serum phenytoin levels.\n\nThe mechanism by which ethosuximide affects neuronal excitability includes block of T-type calcium channels, and may include effects of the drug on other classes of ion channel. The primary finding that ethosuximide is a T-type calcium channel blocker gained widespread support, but initial attempts to replicate the finding were inconsistent. Subsequent experiments on recombinant T-type channels in cell lines demonstrated conclusively that ethosuximide blocks all T-type calcium channel isoforms. Significant T-type calcium channel density occurs in dendrites of neurons, and recordings from reduced preparations that strip away this dendritic source of T-type calcium channels may have contributed to reports of ethosuximide ineffectiveness.\n\nIn March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince showed that ethosuximide and dimethadione, both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons. In June of that same year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be voltage-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that valproic acid, which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that. The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not. The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in dorsal root ganglia at concentrations ranging from 7 \"µ\"mol/L to 1 mmol/L.\n\nThat same year, however, Herrington and Lingle found no such effect at concentrations of up to 2.5 mmol/L. The year after, a study conducted on human neocortical cells removed during surgery for intractable epilepsy, the first to use human tissue, found that ethosuximide had no effect on Ca currents at the concentrations typically needed for a therapeutic effect.\n\nIn 1998, Slobodan M. Todorovic and Christopher J. Lingle of Washington University reported a 100% block of T-type current in dorsal root ganglia at 23.7 ± 0.5 mmol/L, far higher than Kostyuk reported. That same year, Leresche et al. reported that ethosuximide had no effect on T-type currents, but did decrease noninactivating Na current by 60% and the Ca-activated K currents by 39.1 ± 6.4% in rat and cat thalamocortical cells. It was concluded that the decrease in Na current is responsible for the anti-absence properties.\n\nIn the introduction of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons that had lost most of their T-type channels. Using cloned αG, αH, and αI T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that ethosuximide blocked the channels with an IC of 12 ± 2 mmol/L and that of \"N\"-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of mesuximide) is 1.95 ± 0.19 mmol/L for αG, 1.82 ± 0.16 mmol/L for αI, and 3.0 ± 0.3 mmol/L for αH. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward.\n\nEthosuximide is a chiral drug with a stereocenter. Therapeutically, the racemate, the 1: 1 mixture of (\" S \") and (\" R \") - isomers used.\n\nEthosuximide, along with phenobarbital and phenytoin, is one of the few antiepileptic medications that people can generally afford in most areas of the world as of 2008. The wholesale cost from an NGO in the Democratic Republic of Congo is about US$28 per month for the defined daily dose of 1,250 mg as of 2014.\n\nIn the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$96 per month as of 2019. With discounts this amount may be purchased for around US$57 in the United States. As of 2019 there were concerns in the United States that the price of ethosuximide was inflated by manufacturers.\n\nIn Italy the retail price of 750 mg per day for a year was about 133 Euro in 2011. In the United Kingdom the syrup formulation in 2011 was less expensive than the tables on a per mg basis (£0.68 per 250 mg tablet versus £0.11 per 250 mg of liquid).\n\nAvailability of ethosuximide is limited in many countries. It was marketed under the trade names Emeside and Zarontin. However, both capsule preparations were discontinued from production, leaving only generic preparations available. Emeside capsules were discontinued by their manufacturer, Laboratories for Applied Biology, in 2005. Similarly, Zarontin capsules were discontinued by Pfizer in 2007. Syrup preparations of both brands remained available.\n\n"}

{"id": "2205943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205943", "title": "Cleveland Amory", "text": "Cleveland Amory\n\nCleveland Amory (September 2, 1917 – October 14, 1998) was an American author, reporter and commentator and animal rights activist. He originally was known for writing a series of popular books poking fun at the pretensions and customs of society, starting with \"The Proper Bostonians\" in 1947. From the 1950s through the 1990s, he had a long career as a reporter and writer for national magazines, and as a television and radio commentator. In the late 1980s and 1990s, he was best known for his bestselling books about his adopted cat, Polar Bear, starting with \"The Cat Who Came for Christmas\" (1987). Amory devoted much of his life to promoting animal rights, particularly protection of animals from hunting and vivisection; the executive director of the Humane Society of the United States described Amory as \"the founding father of the modern animal protection movement.\"\n\nAmory was born September 2, 1917, into a privileged and established Boston family; his parents were Robert Amory and Leonore Cobb Amory, daughter of Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb. During his childhood, he had a great affection for his aunt Lucy \"Lu\" Creshore, who took in many stray animals and was instrumental in helping Amory get his first puppy as a child, an event that Amory remembered seventy years later as the most memorable moment of his childhood.\n\nIn 1936, when he was 18, Amory held a summer job as tutor and companion to 13-year-old William Zinsser, who grew up to be a notable writer and editor. Zinsser later recalled that they had many discussions about their shared interest in journalism, which at that time was not considered a suitable profession for upper-class young men. Amory attended Harvard where he was president of \"The Harvard Crimson\".\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard in 1939, Amory became the youngest editor ever hired by \"The Saturday Evening Post\", a position he held until 1941 when he left to serve in the Second World War. Amory served in military intelligence in the United States Army from 1941 to 1943. Upon returning, he worked as a writer and reporter for various publications. Around 1945, Amory witnessed a bullfight in Nogales, Mexico which strongly influenced him to become an activist for animal rights.\n\nStarting in the late 1940s, Amory gained fame for writing a series of bestselling social history books, starting with \"The Proper Bostonians\" (1947), and continuing through \"The Last Resorts\" (1952) and \"Who Killed Society?\" (1960), that satirized the pretensions of the upper class society, particularly in Boston, where he had grown up. In 1952, he became a regular columnist for the weekly magazine \"Saturday Review\". He continued to write the column for 20 years, until 1972. He also wrote articles for many other publications. In the spring of 1955, he traveled to France with his then-wife Martha for an assignment with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Amory agreed to ghostwrite the Duchess' autobiography, but after realizing that she wanted him to sugar-coat her life, he quickly left the project.\n\nIn 1952, Amory was hired as a commentator on the NBC morning news and talk television program, \"Today\", which at that time was new and the first of its genre in the world. He provided a televised commentary every few weeks, usually containing light humor or satire. Because his subject matter tended to be light, the network did not review his planned commentaries in advance. Amory continued as a popular regular commentator for eleven years until 1963, when he was fired in one of his first controversial moments relating to his views on animal rights.\n\nIn 1963, Amory learned that the American Legion in Harmony, North Carolina planned to sponsor a \"bunny bop\" rabbit killing contest. At that time, wild rabbits in the United States were widely regarded as both agricultural pests and game animals for hunting and eating. After learning of the \"bunny bop,\" Amory and his assistant traveled to Harmony to engage in a debate with its planners. When he returned, instead of the usual lighthearted commentary expected by the \"Today\" show management, Amory proposed, on air and during viewers' breakfast hour, the formation of a hunt club where human hunters would be tracked down and killed for sport, arguing that killing hunters in cold blood would be humane and kind due to their overpopulation. Viewer response was overwhelmingly negative and Amory was quickly reprimanded by NBC President Julian Goodman. Just a few months later, Amory again voiced controversial animal rights opinions during his \"Today\" show segment by speaking at length about the evils of vivisection — the abuse of animals in laboratory experiments. Although Amory did not entirely oppose the scientific use of animals, he strongly believed that many of them were being inhumanely and needlessly mistreated. His commentary drew opposition from a number of scientists, and he was abruptly fired from the \"Today\" show with no warning or reprimand.\n\nAs time went by, the subject matter of Amory's published work increasingly focused on animal rights. From 1963 to 1976, Amory was a television critic for \"TV Guide\" magazine, where he drew the ire of hunters for his biting criticisms of sports hunting. His book \"Man Kind? Our Incredible War on Wildlife\" (1974) detailed inhumane hunting practices, sparking an editorial in \"The New York Times\" and a CBS documentary on hunting, \"The Guns of Autumn\". Amory also presented a daily radio essay called \"Curmudgeon at Large\". Later he wrote a syndicated column called \"Animail\", and served as a senior contributing editor of \"Parade\" magazine from 1980 to 1998.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Amory wrote another series of bestselling nonfiction books about Polar Bear, a stray, starving white cat whom he had rescued from a Manhattan street on Christmas Eve 1977. \"The Cat Who Came for Christmas\" (1987) spent twelve weeks at #1 on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. Its sequels, \"The Cat and the Curmudgeon\" (1990) and \"The Best Cat Ever\" (1993, published after Polar Bear's death), also were bestsellers.\n\nIn 1988, Amory made his only feature film appearance in the role of \"Mr. Danforth\" in the comedy-drama \"Mr. North\", starring Anthony Edwards.\n\nBeginning in the early 1960s, Amory, while maintaining his career as an outspoken reporter and commentator, began to devote an increasing amount of his time to animal rights organizations. In 1962, he joined the board of directors of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), remaining there until 1970. Amory also served as president of the New England Anti-Vivisection Society (NEAVS) from 1987 until his death in 1998.\n\nIn 1967, Amory founded the Fund for Animals, with a planned focus on protecting animals from hunters and creating animal sanctuaries. The Fund struggled during the first years of its existence, but became known in 1979 for sponsoring a removal by air and land of 580 Grand Canyon burros slated for destruction by the National Park Service. Amory later fought a similar battle to prevent the killing of San Clemente Island's goats by the Department of Defense. By the time Amory died in 1998, the Fund had a \"$2 million budget, more than 200,000 members, and three animal sanctuaries, and had initiated several high profile animal rescues, including the organic 'painting' of baby harp seals off the Magdalen Islands in Canada to ensure that their fur was worthless to hunters.\"\n\nIn 2005, a few years after Amory's death, HSUS formed a corporate combination with the Fund for Animals.\n\nInspired by Anna Sewell's novel \"Black Beauty\", Amory established the Black Beauty Ranch, a 1,460-acre sanctuary that sheltered various abused animals including chimpanzees, burros and elephants. Located in Murchison, Texas, this ranch accommodated over 600 resident animals. Amory's goal when creating the animal refuge was to \"create a sanctuary where its inhabitants would roam unfettered and unbothered by human taskmasters.\" The words on the ranch's gate are taken from the final lines of Sewell's novel, \"I have nothing to fear, / and my story ends. / My troubles are all over, / and I am at home.\"\n\nThe original impetus for creating the ranch was to have a sanctuary for the many burros rescued in 1979 and the early 1980s by the Fund for Animals. The Ranch became the largest sanctuary sponsored by the Fund. One of Black Beauty's most famous residents was a 25-year-old chimp named Nim Chimpsky who had been used in language experiments when young, then sold as a laboratory animal.\n\nThe ranch was the fulfillment of a longtime dream for Amory. He explained in his 1997 book \"Ranch of Dreams\", \"It was not long after reading Black Beauty for the first time that I had a dream that one day I would have a place which would embody everything Black Beauty loved about his final home. I dreamed that I would go even a step further—at my place none of the horses would ever wear a bit or blinkers or check reins, or in fact have reins at all, because they would never pull a cart, a carriage, a cab, or anything else. Indeed, they would never even be ridden- they would just run free.\"\n\nBlack Beauty Ranch is currently operated by HSUS.\n\nIn 1978, Amory purchased the first oceangoing vessel for Captain Paul Watson, the founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Watson used this boat in his first actions against the Japanese whaling fleet.

Staal specialized in the study of Vedic ritual and mantras, and the scientific exploration of ritual and mysticism. He was also a scholar of Greek and Indian logic and philosophy and Sanskrit grammar.\n\nStaal was born in Amsterdam, the son of the architect Jan Frederik Staal, and studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. He continued with Indian philosophy and Sanskrit at Madras and Banaras. Staal was Professor of General and Comparative Philosophy in Amsterdam, 1962–67. He became Professor of Philosophy and South Asian Languages at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1968, and he retired in 1991. \n\nStaal became a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979.\n\nStaal argued that the ancient Indian grammarians, especially Pāṇini, had completely mastered methods of linguistic theory not rediscovered again until the 1950s and the applications of modern mathematical logic to linguistics by Noam Chomsky. (Chomsky himself has said that the first generative grammar in the modern sense was Panini's grammar). \nThe early methods allowed the construction of discrete, potentially infinite generative systems. Remarkably, these early linguistic systems were codified orally, though writing was then used to develop them in some way. The formal basis for Panini's methods involved the use of \"auxiliary\" markers, rediscovered in the 1930s by the logician Emil Post. Post's rewrite systems are now a standard approach for the description of computer languages. The ancient discoveries were motivated by the need to preserve exact Sanskrit pronunciation and expression given the primacy of language in ancient Indian thought. \n\nIn 1975, a consortium of scholars, led by Staal, documented the twelve-day performance, in Panjal village, Kerala, of the Vedic Agnicayana ritual. It is available as a documentary titled Altar of Fire. It was thought possible that this would be the last performance of the ritual, but it has since been revived.\nIn \"Rules without Meaning\" Staal controversially suggested that mantras \"predate language in the development of man in a chronological sense\". He pointed out that there is evidence that ritual existed before language, and argued that syntax was influenced by ritual.\n\nHis more recent study was concerned with Greek and Vedic geometry.\nHe drew a parallel between geometry and linguistics, writing that, \"Panini is the Indian Euclid.\" Staal's point is that Panini showed how to extend spoken Sanskrit to a formal metalanguage for the language itself. \n\nFrits Staal retired to Thailand, and died at his home in Chiangmai, aged 81.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It impounds the River Guadiana, on the border of Beja and Évora Districts in south of Portugal. The dam takes its name from the town of Alqueva to its right bank. It creates a large reservoir with an inter-annual regulation capacity from which water may be distributed throughout the region. The dam was completed in 2002 and its reservoir reached the full level, for the first time, in 2010. The power station was commissioned in two stages, stage I in 2004 and stage II in 2013. The Alqueva Dam constitutes one of the largest dams and artificial lakes () in Western Europe.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Portuguese Prime Minister, António de Oliveira Salazar, ordered a study of the feasibility of the dam project. The potential benefits of the Alqueva dam were discussed for decades. An initial effort was undertaken after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, but it was abandoned in 1978. The Portuguese government eventually made a firm decision to build the dam in the 1990s, during the Cavaco Silva and António Guterres governments.\n\nAldeia da Luz, a small village that lay in the projected flood zone of the dam, was completely rebuilt on a new site.\n\nThe construction of the new dam was carried out by a joint venture of Bento Pedroso Construções, Cubiertas y MZOV, Dragados and Somague – Sociedade de Construções. \nOn February 8, 2002, the high floodgates of the Alqueva dam were closed. In January 2010 the lake was filled to the planned level, with a surface area of 250 km. When filled to capacity, the shoreline of Alqueva Lake, also known as Grande Lago, is nearly 1200 kilometers and the maximum depth is about 100 meters. A well-developed commercial marina has grown-up to the southeast of the town of Amieira, which provides all types of boating services.\n\nIn 2004, the first stage of the hydroelectric power station was commissioned, with a capacity of . The second stage, with an additional 259 MW, was commissioned in 2013. The power station contains four reversible Francis turbines. With these turbines, the power station is afforded a pumped-storage capability. Power is generated during high demand periods and at times of low demand, the turbines reverse and pump water from a much smaller reservoir below the dam back into the main reservoir. Pedrogao Dam forms the lower reservoir.\n\nComplementing the Alqueva dam, which is equipped with a pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, is the Pedrógão Dam, located downstream from Alqueva beside the settlement of the same name and also equipped with a mini hydroelectric plant. The purpose of the Pedrógão dam is the creation of a lower reservoir for the Alqueva, for the recovery of flows, also serving as a source of water for the Ardila and Pedrógão water supply subsystems. The Álamos pumping station takes water from Alqueva and distributes it throughout the entire Alqueva water supply subsystem. Another two pumping stations, Pedrógão/Left Bank and Pedrógão/Right Bank, distribute water to the Ardila and Pedrógão subsystems respectively. The main infrastructure also includes the primary and secondary networks, pumping stations, intermediate dams, reservoirs and drainage and road networks.\n\nThe goals of the Alqueva Multi-Purpose Project have been based on the principal shortfalls of the Alentejo region. The answers to these needs make up the project's main goals:\n\nThe dam caused the loss of prehistoric engravings and habitat of rare and endangered species including eagles, kites, wild boars, and the Iberian lynx. A Roman fort was also submerged.\n\nThe Alqueva Multi Purpose Project has a strong financial investment in impact mitigation plans. The archaeological intervention of about 1,200 cultural heritage sites is one result.\n\nAn environmental leader, José Paulo Martins, said the dam is a waste of money, as \"the government's own secret reports say only 48% of the irrigated land can be worked profitably\".\n\n"}

Coleman du Pont\n\nThomas Coleman du Pont (December 11, 1863 – November 11, 1930) was an American engineer and politician, from Greenville, Delaware. He was President of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, and a member of the Republican Party who served parts of two terms as United States Senator from Delaware.\n\nDu Pont was born at Louisville, Kentucky. He was a cousin of U.S. Senator Henry A. du Pont and great grandson of Eleuthère Irénée du Pont, the founder of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. Du Pont attended preparatory school at Urbana University and earned an engineering degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While at MIT, he was initiated into the Sigma Chi fraternity.\n\nHe married a cousin, Alice Elsie du Pont (granddaughter of Charles I. du Pont), and in 1891 they had a daughter, Alice Hounsfield du Pont. In 1921, Alice married Clayton Douglass Buck, future U.S. Senator and two-term governor of Delaware. She inherited her father's family home, Buena Vista, and in 1965 the Bucks sold it to the State of Delaware for $1. The state now operates it as the Buena Vista Conference Center. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\n\nDu Pont started his career in the family's coal mines, the Central Coal and Iron Company, and soon pursued opportunities in street railways. In 1894, he began working as the general manager of the Johnson Street Rail Company in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.\n\nWith his cousins, Alfred I. du Pont and Pierre S. du Pont, T. Coleman du Pont bought out the family's explosives business in Delaware. He was president from 1902 until 1915, during which time he oversaw the acquisitions of more than one hundred competitors. He was a key player in the formation of the holding company, E. I du Pont de Nemours Company of New Jersey. In 1907, the DuPont Company was sued for antitrust violations; he later sold off his stake of the business in 1914.\n\nDu Pont had control of the Hotel McAlpin, Claridge Atlantic City, Wallick's, and other American hotels. Together with Lucius M. Boomer, president of Boomer-du Pont Properties Corporation and husband of Jørgine Boomer, du Pont owned a number of other hotels. In 1918, they purchased the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, then in 1920 the Willard Hotel in Washington, D. C. and in 1925 the company purchased The Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia from the heirs of the founder, George C. Boldt.\n\nIn 1915, du Pont acquired control of The Equitable Life Assurance Society from J. P. Morgan and was responsible for the building of the Equitable Life Building in New York City, once the largest building in the city.\n\nIn 1908, du Pont proposed a modern road that was to run the length of Delaware from Selbyville north to Wilmington as part of a philanthropic measure. This roadway was planned to improve travel and bring economic development to Kent and Sussex counties. The DuPont Highway was to be modeled after the great boulevards of Europe and was to have a wide right-of-way consisting of a wide roadway for automobiles flanked by dual trolley lines, wide roadways for heavy vehicles, wide unpaved roadways for horses, and sidewalks. Utilities were to be buried underground below the horse roadways. The highway was also to include agricultural experimental stations and monuments for future surveying. Trolley revenues would help pay for the construction of the roadway.\n\nAfter portions of the DuPont Highway were built, these portions were planned to be turned over to the state at no charge. The Coleman DuPont Road, Inc. was established in 1911 and construction of the DuPont Highway began. The DuPont Highway would end up being built as a two-lane concrete road on a alignment with a wide roadway.\n\nThe Delaware State Highway Department took over construction and the DuPont Highway was completed in 1923 when the final section near Odessa was finished. The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction with the rise of the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis. Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north.\n\nThe DuPont Highway became US 113 between Selbyville and Dover and US 13 between Dover and Wilmington.\n\nDu Pont retired from business activities in 1915 and became involved in Republican Party politics, as a member of the Republican National Committee from 1908 until 1930. It was largely under his leadership that the Union Republicans and Regular Republicans came back together and built the modern Delaware Republican Party.\n\nDu Pont was appointed to the U.S. Senate on July 7, 1921, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of U.S. Senator Josiah O. Wolcott. During this term, he served with the Republican majority in the 67th Congress. However, he lost his bid to complete the term in a special election on November 7, 1922. On the same day he also lost his bid for the full term to follow, in both instances losing to Democrat Thomas F. Bayard, Jr., a Wilmington lawyer who was married to one of du Pont's cousins.\n\nDu Pont was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1924, defeating the incumbent Republican U.S. Senator L. Heisler Ball for the nomination, and going on to defeat Democrat James M. Tunnell, a Georgetown, Delaware lawyer. During this term, he served with the Republican majority in the 69th and 70th Congress, until health problems caused him to resign.\n\nIn all, du Pont served two separate terms, one from July 7, 1921 until November 21, 1922, during the administration of U.S. President Warren G. Harding, and the other from March 4, 1925 until December 9, 1928, during the administration of U.S. President Calvin Coolidge. The later years of his life were marked by his implication in the Teapot Dome scandal, and by lawsuits over various Florida real estate deals.\n\nDu Pont suffered from cancer of the larynx and died at Buena Vista. He was buried in the Du Pont de Nemours Cemetery in Greenville, Delaware.\n\nElections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. U.S. Senators are popularly elected and took office March 4 for a six-year term.\n\n\n"}

At almost long, it initially flows south to Dullatur Bog where it falls into a man made trench and takes a ninety degree turn flowing west through Strathkelvin and along the northern boundary of the bog parallel with the Forth and Clyde Canal.\n\nThe famous physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin was named Baron Kelvin in honour of his achievements, named after the river that flowed past his university.\n\nThe river's first important (and considerably larger) confluence is with the Chantyclear Burn which originates from the ridge of Dullatur. It then continues its westward flow being joined by the often depleted (due to water being diverted to the canal) Shawend Burn to the west of Craigmarloch bridge. The next important tributary is the Garrel at a point south-east of Kilsyth south of Dumbreck Marsh. The Kelvin then passes through the large flood plain north of Twechar where it is fed by the Dock Water, Queenzie Burn, the Cast Burn and the Board Burn before reaching Kirkintilloch at its confluence with the more substantial waters of the Glazert and Luggie. It then flows past Torrance, meanders through Balmore Haughs, to the south of Bardowie where it joins the Allander Water, after which it takes a south-westerly direction towards Maryhill, Hillhead, through Kelvingrove Park before falling into the River Clyde at Yorkhill Basin in the city of Glasgow.\n\nWildlife along Strathkelvin include the grey squirrel, magpie, grey heron, cormorant, blue tit, great tit, chaffinch, snipe, great spotted woodpecker, blackbird, redwing, carrion crow, kingfisher, mallard, goosander, roe deer, red fox, otter, water vole, mink and brown rat.\n\nSuccessive attempts at improving the quality of the water have been rewarded by the return of salmon. The river has always been home to brown trout and both species can be fished by obtaining the relevant permits.\n\nThe Kelvin is bridged at several points throughout Glasgow. Most notable is the Great Western Bridge on Great Western Road in the city's West End. Below this bridge is an underground station that bears the name Kelvinbridge, a name commonly attached to the area. Other bridges include the one near the Antonine Wall at Balmuildy, Partick Bridge on Dumbarton Road, the bridge at Queen Margaret Drive, Ha'penny Bridge and several in the grounds of Kelvingrove Park.\n\nThe Kelvin Aqueduct carries the Forth and Clyde Canal over the river.

{"id": "2206019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206019", "title": "Jagged Alliance", "text": "Jagged Alliance\n\nJagged Alliance is a tactical role-playing game released in 1995 for MS-DOS. It was developed by Madlab Software and published by Sir-Tech. It is the first game in the \"Jagged Alliance\" series. It was re-released in 2008 on GOG.com and in 2010 on GamersGate, both with Windows support. A version for Nintendo DS was released in 2009\n\n\"Jagged Alliance\" takes place on the fictional South Atlantic island of Metavira, a former nuclear testing site. The nuclear tests altered some trees on the island and several years later it was discovered by a scientist, Brenda Richards, that those trees, known as Fallow trees, produce unique sap that proves to be a medical marvel. However, Brenda also discovered that the trees could not reproduce.\n\nHer assistant, Lucas Santino, realised how profitable this sap would be. He managed to convince Jack Richards, the leader of the scientific mission, that it would be beneficial to have two independent science teams. Santino consequently established a new base on the other side of the island. He immediately began to recruit new people and gradually took over the island by force.\n\nWhen the game begins, the player is contacted by Jack Richards and is invited to the island. There, Brenda and her father request that the player hires mercenaries through the Association of International Mercenaries (A.I.M.) to reclaim the island from Santino's forces sector by sector.\n\nThe player starts the game and every following day in a room. Here the player can load and save the game, change settings, hire new mercenaries or sleep until the next day.\n\nWhen the player starts a new day, the game is transferred to a screen displaying Metavira on a square grid. The map includes information such as the number of Fallow trees in each sector, whether the sector is enemy or player controlled, how many guards and tappers are in a sector and the terrain information. The player can also decide what mercenaries and equipment to take and what player-owned sector to start from.\n\nMercenaries, guards and tappers need to be paid; if needed, the player can raise the guards' and tappers' salaries to make them happier. Mercenaries can be left at the base to either heal, train skills or repair items. Occasionally, Jack or Brenda Richards contact the player with an important objective, such as securing a clean water source. These requests can be ignored but usually cause some kind of hindrance to the player at a later date.\n\nWhen the player has chosen the mercenaries and equipment to take to the mission, he is taken to the sector he chose earlier overseeing his mercenaries from a top-down viewpoint. The player can now directly command his chosen mercenaries and issue movement orders. The player may move the mercenaries to one adjacent sector. The player is limited to a single save slot during the day.\n\nWhen player characters and enemies are in the same sector, the game switches to turn-based play. Both sides take turns to move and perform actions, which uses their action points. The number of action points is determined by the character's attributes. Tougher terrain surfaces on the ground use up greater numbers of action points. Interrupts are possible. Mercenaries can also crouch to make themselves a smaller target or take cover behind objects. It is possible to walk backwards and move stealthily so the mercenary can avoid being noticed by the enemy, though both of these actions uses more action points than normal moving.\n\nWhen attacking, there is a certain chance that the mercenary will hit. The chance to hit is also affected by the number of action points the player uses to aim. Attacks can be done in a wide variety of ways, using firearms, close combat weapons like knives, throwing weapons such as hand grenades and explosive devices like land mines. When the day ends mercenaries return to the base for sleep. The day can also end during a battle and mercenaries might suffer additional injuries as they retreat from the enemy sector. The sector is conquered when all the enemies are killed or is lost when all the player's mercenaries, guards and tappers are killed or otherwise neglected from posting guards.\n\nThe main characters in the game are the hireable mercenaries along with other non-player characters (NPCs), such as the player's employers Jack and Brenda Richards, and the main antagonist, Lucas Santino. There are also four native characters that might be offered to the player as guides. The player can only control the mercenaries. Guards, tappers and enemies are controlled by the artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThere are 60 hireable mercenaries and the player can recruit up to eight mercenaries at a time. Some mercenaries will refuse to join at start, as they want to see if the player can be trusted to lead them, either through acceptable performance or enough days on the island.\n\nEvery mercenary has four attributes - health, agility, dexterity, wisdom, and four skills - medical, explosives, mechanical and marksmanship. Health determines the amount of damage a mercenary can take, agility determines how many action points they have, dexterity helps in using weapons and other items in their various conditions, wisdom enables mercenaries to get experience quicker, medical helps to heal wounded characters, explosives helps to disarm bombs and activate the mercenary's own explosives, mechanical helps to pick locks and combine items together and marksmanship helps to get a better aim and shot on enemies. The mercenaries employed by the player gain experience from the actions they perform. For example, a mercenary that bandages a wound might improve his medical skill. Mercenaries may also permanently lose attribute points from an injury. For example, a hit in the head might reduce mercenary's wisdom or a hit in the leg might reduce his agility.\n\nAdditionally, every mercenary has an experience level that determines how much he gets paid; and when a new level is obtained they demand a raise that the player either has to agree to, or lose the mercenary.\n\nEach character has a number of health points. When a mercenary is injured he slowly bleeds losing health points; bandaging the wound stops the bleeding. This gives the mercenary temporary 'bandage points' that change back to health points over time, but may be quickly lost if the mercenary is injured again. Of course, mercenaries who die are permanently dead and cannot be revived or replaced.\n\nEach mercenary has a unique personality. There are several characters that are not fond of certain other mercenaries, and can decline joining the player's team for this reason. Some characters can still be hired but will later complain about the other mercenary. Either mercenary may leave the player's group during the night and is shown to be missing on the A.I.M. site. There are also stubborn characters that might refuse to move until an enemy they were targeting has been killed or the enemy moves out of the mercenary's line of sight.\n\nThere is a large variety of items in the game - some of them play a significant role in the plot while others are there for use.\n\nWhen the player hires a mercenary he arrives with weapons and equipment. The player can equip the mercenary with various body armour, helmets, goggles and radios. There are standard vests that have pockets along with vests with no pockets that act as body armor. The vests with pockets may have two to five pockets and each one can hold either one particular item or a number of identical items like magazines or hand grenades. Mercenaries can also carry things in their hands.\n\nThe player can store an unlimited number of items in the base, but has to transport them with the mercenaries from the sectors to the base.\n\nOn 26 August 2008, Empire Interactive announced that a Nintendo DS version was in development by Strategy First Inc. and Cypron Studios. The game was originally announced for release on 17 February 2009, but was later pushed back to 5 May 2009 in America and 26 June 2009 in Europe.\n\nThe game differs in many ways from the DOS version. Graphics have a smaller scale and a very different texture on the sector maps. There are completely new music tracks and improved cinematic cutscenes. Features removed include item repairs, item conditions, bandage points, moving backwards, door manipulation closeups and deadly eels in the water.\n\n\"Jagged Alliance\" was a commercial success. According to William R. Trotter of \"PC Gamer US\", \"\"JA\" won plaudits from the critics and became the best-selling non-\"Wizardry\" title in Sirtech's history.\" That magazine's Marc Saltzman similarly noted that \"Jagged Alliance\" \"sold reasonably well\" and received critical acclaim.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PC version of the game, and stated that \"don't expect a deep roleplaying experience from this one – but if you're looking for an entertaining mix of RPG and strategy, grab it.\"\n\nThe editors of \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" named \"Jagged Alliance\" the best turn-based strategy game of 1995, tied with \"\".\n\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"Jagged Alliance\" the 114th best computer game ever released.\n"}

(), is a Spanish football team based in Elx, Province of Alacant, in the Valencian Community. Founded in 1923, the club plays in the Segunda División, holding home matches at \"Estadio Manuel Martínez Valero\", with a capacity of 33,732 seats. \n\nFounded in 1923 as the result of a merger between all of the town's clubs, Elche entered the league system in 1929, reaching Segunda División in 1934 and La Liga in 1959, finishing fifth in the latter tournament in 1963–64. It was runner-up in the Copa del Rey in 1969. They were relegated at the end of the 2014–15 season due to unpaid tax debts.\n\nElche Club de Fútbol was founded in the summer of 1923, after the merger of all of the town's football teams. The club's first-ever game was against Monóvar, where they beat the home team 4–0, and its first official match was a 2–0 win over Crevillente. In its first years Elche, like many teams of the time, played in all white uniform. The team played its first league season in 1929–30, in Tercera División, achieving promotion to Segunda División in 1934; it suffered relegation for the first time six years later, but promoted back the following season.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Elche achieved two consecutive promotions from the third level to La Liga, securing its first promotion to the latter competition with a 3–0 success against Tenerife in 1959.\n\nElche opened its first season in the top level with a 1–1 draw against Real Oviedo, the first goal being scored by Vicente Pahuet. The club finished tenth out of 16 sides, nine points ahead of relegated Osasuna – the campaign included a 2–1 comeback home victory over Barcelona, but also a 2–11 loss at Real Madrid. The following season saw the team having to compete in the relegation/promotion play-off, where it overcame a 0–1 loss in the away leg against Atlético Ceuta with a 4–0 home victory.\n\nElche achieved their best-ever league finish in 1963–64, ranking in fifth position. The season also saw the club's reserve team, Elche Ilicitano, promote to Segunda División.\n\nIn 1969 the club reached their first and only Copa del Rey final, following victories over Pontevedra, Valencia and Real Sociedad. The semi-final against the latter was won 2–0 in a replay in neutral Madrid, as the tie had finished 4–4 on aggregate; the final, played on June 15 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in the same city, brought a 0–1 loss to Athletic Bilbao.\n\nAfter twelve seasons Elche was relegated to division two in 1971, having finished second from bottom. Two years later the team returned to the main category, as champions. Its second spell in the top flight lasted five seasons, often immerse in relegation fights as the best campaign (1974–75) ended with the club in eighth position; at the end of 1977–78 the side returned to the second division after finishing 17th out of 18 clubs, the last game being a 4–4 draw with Atlético Madrid, which was led 2–4 with five minutes remaining.\n\nAfter the relegation in 1978 Elche suffered. Although on paper they had a good team they never managed to gain promotion to the top flight – in fact, in the first five years since their return to the second level, they were fourth on three occasions and fifth on two (and on a further two, even on points with the third-placed team but with a worse goal difference), often losing the chance of promotion on the last matchday. Especially traumatic was the finish of the 1980–81 season: with one game remaining, they were second two points ahead of Rayo Vallecano and Racing de Santander, only needing a draw against Cádiz at the \"Martínez Valero\"; the game ended however in a loss, and Elche finished with 45 points alongside Castellón, Cádiz, Racing and Rayo.\n\nA promotion finally occurred at the end of 1983–84, even though Elche only finished fifth in the regular season – the first two positions were occupied by Real Madrid Castilla and Athletic Bilbao B, who could not promote as reserve sides. The whole of the top division campaign was spent in the relegation zone, and relegation consequently befell as 17th. In 1988 they were promoted again for another cameo appearance, as the side went on to finish dead last with eighteen points, dropping down a category alongside Real Murcia, who they trailed by nine points; the last match for years in the category was a 1–3 away loss against Real Zaragoza, the goal coming courtesy of Alfonso Fernández.\n\nAfter the relegation in 1989, Elche started to suffer heavily in the financial department, and relegated to Segunda División B – the new third level created in 1977 – at the end of 1990–91. During the better part of the 1990s the club reached the second division promotion playoffs, only to consecutively fall short.\n\nIn 1997 Elche finally managed to return to division two, being immediately relegated back but gaining another promotion subsequently.\n\nIn 2010–11, again in the \"silver category\", the team finished fourth and thus qualified for the play-offs: after disposing of Real Valladolid in the first round (3–2 on aggregate) the dream of top flight promotion ended at the hands of Granada, on the away goals rule.\n\nOn May 18, 2013, following Barcelona B and Alcorcón's 1–1 draw, Elche was automatically promoted to the top level, returning to the competition after 24 years. In the meantime the team coached by Fran Escribá had broken a number of Segunda División records, being the only team to date able to lead the competition from the very first until the last match of the season, setting in the process a new record of both matches won and points scored to date as well as the best first round in the history of Segunda's championship.\n\nDuring the 2013–14 season, the team managed to keep in the top competition, with an average attendance to home matches estimated at 25,104 people.\n\nIn the 2014–15 season, despite managing once again to keep in the top flight (the team was already safe from relegation four dates before the end of the competition) Elche became the first team ever in the history of the Spanish \"Primera División\" being relegated to \"Segunda\" following new regulations by the Spanish football league limiting excess debt and economic mismanagement.\n\nIn the 2016–17 season, Elche were relegated to third level after defeated by Cádiz and played on between first and second division every 18 years. \n\nOne year later, Elche promoted back to second level after defeated Villarreal B in the last play off promotion to second level. \n\nIn the 2018-19 season Elche finished right in the middle, on 11th place among 22 teams.\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nElche's reserve team, Elche Ilicitano, was founded in 1932.

{"id": "2206044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206044", "title": "Polyandry in Tibet", "text": "Polyandry in Tibet\n\nPolyandry is a rare marital arrangement in which a woman has several husbands. In Tibet, those husbands are often brothers; \"fraternal polyandry\". Concern over which children are fathered by which brother falls on the wife alone. She may or may not say who the father is because she does not wish to create conflict in the family or is unsure who the biological father is. Historically the social system compelled marriage within a social class.\n\nWhen the People's Republic of China annexed Tibet, political systems in many regions of Tibet remained unchanged until, between 1959 and 1960, political reforms changed the land ownership and taxation systems.\n\nSince 1981, the Tibet Autonomous Region government no longer permits new polyandric marriages under family law. Even though it is currently illegal, after collective farming was phased out and the farmed land reverted in the form of long-term leases to individual families, polyandry in Tibet is \"de facto\" the norm in rural areas.\n\nStudies have attempted to explain the existence of polyandry in Tibet. One reason put forward in traditional literature is that by not allowing land to be split between brothers, Tibetan families retained farms sufficiently large to continue supporting their family. Another reason for polyandry is that the mountainous terrain makes some of the farm land difficult to farm, requiring more physical strength. Women take multiple husbands because they are strong and able to help tend their land.\n\nThe Tibetan social organization under Lhasa control from the 17th century on was quasi-feudal, in that arable land was divided and owned by aristocratic families, religious organizations, and the central government and the population was subject to those district divisions. The population was further divided into social classes: \n\nThese wealthier family units hereditarily owned estates leased from their district authority, complete with land titles. In Goldstein's research about the Gyantse district specifically, he found them owning typically from to of land each. Their primary civil responsibility was to pay taxes (\"tre-ba\" and \"khral-pa\" means \"taxpayer\"), and to supply corvée services that included both human and animal labor to their district authority. According to Goldstein, the entire family structure and marriage system were subordinated to serve the land and corporate family unit.\n\nThe family structure and marriage system of \"tre-ba\" were characterized by two fundamental principles: \n\nA \"stem family\" is one in which a married child is inextricably linked to his natal family in \"a common household\". The \"mono-marital principle\" dictates that for each and every generation, one and only one marriage is permitted collectively among all the male siblings, and the children born out of this marriage are members of the family unit who have full legal rights.\n\nThe family organization was based on these two patterns to avoid the partitioning of their estates. A generation with two or more conjugal families was seen as unstable because it could produce serious conflicts that could divide their corporate family land. As a matter of fact, Tibetan inheritance rules of family land, mainly based on agnatic links, did provide for each generation to partition the land between brothers, but this was ignored to prevent the estate unit from being threatened. Polygamous marriage, therefore arose as a solution to this potential threat.\n\nTo elucidate, consider a family with two or more sons. Tibetan inheritance rules gave all males of the family, the right to claim a part of the family estate, so if each son took a different bride, there would be different conjugal families, and this would lead to the partitioning of the land among the different sons' families. To avoid this situation, the solution was a fraternal polyandrous marriage, where the brothers would share a bride. Bi-fraternal polyandrous marriages were more common than tri-fraternal or quadri-fraternal polyandry, because the latter forms of marriage were often characterized by severe familial tensions (reference missing). Different mechanisms were employed to reduce the number of sons within a household, such as making one son a celibate monk, or sending away a son to become an adoptive bridegroom to a family without male children.\n\nAnother kind of marriage, although uncommon, is the \"polygynous marriage\". In a family where all the children were female, sisterly polygynous marriage represented the most common choice. In traditional inheritance rules, only males had rights over the land, but where there were no males to inherit them, the daughters had the right over the corporation’s land. To maintain the familial estate unit, the daughters would share a bridegroom who will move matrilocally (as opposed to the patrilocal principle where the brides move into the husband's family) and become a member of his wife's family.\n\nBigenerational polygamy was present as an application of the mono-marital principle. Consider a family in which the mother died before the son was married. If the widower remarried another woman, two conjugal families would have been created, leading to the eventual partition of the estate. Bigenerational polyandry, whereby the father shared a wife with his son, was therefore the solution to avoid this problem. Conversely, when a woman with no male offspring was widowed, she would share a husband with her daughter (\"bigenerational polygyny\"), thus avoiding land partitioning (reference missing).\n\nIn these mono-marital stem families, the family head, who had a dominant role in the family, was called \"trong bey abo\" (or simply \"abo\"). The \"abo\" who managed the property and resources of the family unit, was always a male, and almost invariably the oldest male of the elder generation in power. Sometimes, a younger brother would assume the \"abo\" role when the eldest male retired.\n\nIn taxpayer families, polyandrous and monogamist marriage were the more common forms of marriage, while much less widespread was the polygynous marriage. Bigenerational forms of polyandry were, however, very rare.\n\nThe householder class (\"du-jung\" or \"dud-chung-ba\") comprised peasants who held only small plots of land that were legally and literally \"individual\" possessions. Land inheritance rules were different from taxpayer families, determined by the district authority and not strictly hereditary to the family unit.\n\nThe householder family structure — unlike the taxpayer families — lacked the single marriage per generation requirement to avoid land parceling. When a son married he often established a new household and split off from the original family unit. If taxpayer sons married that created succession for the family corporation and bound them to the estate for patrimonial and land reasons. Householder marriages did not incur that responsibility, and they generally married for love and were more often monogamist. The small number of polyandry cases within the householder class were limited to only the wealthier families.\n\nThe landless peasants (\"mi-bo\") were not obligated to and did not have any heritable rights to land. Like the householders, they tended to have less polyandry than the taxpayer families.\n\nAs has been seen, fraternal polyandry was a form of marriage that was prevalent among the \"tre-ba\" class. Traditionally, marriages were arranged by the parents, often when the children were still very young. As \"tre-ba\" marriages were decided for patrimonial reasons, the brides' and bridegrooms' personal preferences were of no consequence. In polyandrous conjugal family, the eldest brother was, more often than not, the dominant person in the household. All the other brothers, however, shared the work equally, and had the right to sexual relations with their common wife, who had to treat them equally.\n\nAll children were treated equally, and a \"father\" was not allowed to show any favoritism, even if he knew who his biological children really were, as biological paternity was not regarded as important. Similarly, the children considered all their uncles as their fathers, and a child avoided treating members of the elder generation differently, even if they knew who their biological father was. The children would usually only address the eldest surviving husband as \"father\".\n\nDivorce was quite simple. If one of the brothers in a polyandrous marriage felt displeased, he only had to leave the household. Polyandrous marriages were often characterized by tensions and clashes for a variety of different reasons. For example, conflicts might arise because a younger brother wanted to contest the authority of his eldest brother; sometimes, sexual favoritism might occur, generating tension among the male partners in the marriage, especially so when there were significant age differences among the brothers.\n\nPolyandry declined rapidly in the first decade after the establishment of Tibet Autonomous Region, and was banned during the Cultural Revolution as part of the \"Four Olds\". However, it regained popularity in the 1980s as the policies relaxed and the people's commune system broke down. A 1988 survey by the Tibet University throughout Tibet found that 13.3% of families were polyandric, and 1.7% were polygynous. Currently, polyandry is present in all Tibetan areas, but particularly common in some rural regions of Tsang and Kham that are faced with extreme living conditions. A 2008 study of several villages in Xigaze and Qamdo prefectures found that 20-50% of the families were polyandric, with the majority having two husbands. For some remote settlements, the number was as high as 90%.

She is best remembered for her performances in Powell and Pressburger's \"The Red Shoes\" (1948) and Michael Powell's \"Peeping Tom\" (1960).\n\nShe was born Moira Shearer King at Morton Lodge in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, the only child of civil engineer Harold Charles King and Margaret Crawford Reid, née Shearer. In 1931 her family moved to Ndola, Northern Rhodesia, where her father worked as a civil engineer and where she received her first dancing training under a former pupil of Enrico Cecchetti. She returned to Britain in 1936 and trained with Flora Fairbairn in London for a few months before she was accepted as a pupil by the Russian teacher Nicholas Legat. At his studio she met Mona Inglesby who gave Shearer a part in her new ballet \"Endymion\", presented at an all star matinee at the Cambridge Theatre in 1938. After three years with Legat, she joined the Sadler's Wells Ballet School. After the outbreak of World War II, her parents took her to live in Scotland. She joined Mona Inglesby's International Ballet for its 1941 provincial tour and West End season before moving on to Sadler's Wells in 1942.\n\nShearer first came to the public’s attention as Posy Fossil in the advertisements for the Noel Streatfeild book \"Ballet Shoes\" while she was training under Flora Fairbairn, a good friend of Streatfeild's.\n\nShe achieved international success with her first film role as Victoria Page in the Powell & Pressburger ballet-themed film \"The Red Shoes\", (1948). Even her hair matched the titular footwear, and the role and film were so powerful that although she went on to star in other films and worked as a dancer for many decades, she is primarily known for playing \"Vicky\".\nShearer retired from ballet in 1953, but she continued to act, appearing as Titania in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" at the 1954 Edinburgh Festival. She worked again for Powell on \"The Tales of Hoffmann\" and on the controversial film \"Peeping Tom\" (1960), which damaged Powell's own career.\n\nIn 1972, she was chosen by the BBC to present the Eurovision Song Contest when it was staged at the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. She also wrote for \"The Daily Telegraph\" newspaper and gave talks on ballet worldwide.\n\nThe choreographer Gillian Lynne persuaded her to return to ballet in 1987 to play L. S. Lowry's mother in \"A Simple Man\" for the BBC.\n\nIn 1950, Moira Shearer married journalist and broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy. They were married in the Chapel Royal in London's Hampton Court Palace. She and Kennedy had a son, Alastair, and three daughters, Ailsa, Rachel, and Fiona. Shearer died at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, England at the age of 80.\n\n\n"}

In general, dendrites of basket cells are free branching, contain smooth spines, and extend from 3 to 9 mm. Axons are highly branched, ranging in total from 20 to 50mm in total length. The branched axonal arborizations give rise to the name as they appear as baskets surrounding the soma of the target cell. Basket cells form axo-somatic synapses, meaning their synapses target somas of other cells. By controlling the somas of other neurons, basket cells can directly control the action potential discharge rate of target cells.\n\nBasket cells can be found throughout the brain, in among other the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and the cerebellum.\n\nIn the cortex, basket cells have sparsely branched axons giving off small pericellular, basket-shaped elaborations at several intervals along their length. Basket cells make up 5-10% of total neurons in the cortex. There are three types of basket cells in the cortex, the small, large and nest type: The axon of a small basket cell arborizes in the vicinity of that same cell's dendritic range, this axon is short. In contrast, large basket cells innervate somata in different cortical columns due to a long axon. The nest basket cells are an intermediate form of the small and large cells, their axons are confined mainly to the same cortical layer as their somata. Nest basket cells have \"radiating axonal collaterals\" between that of large and small basket cells. They are included as basket cells because they are interneurons that perform axo-somatic synapses.\n\nHippocampal basket cells target somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Similar to their counterparts in the cortex, hippocampal basket cells are also parvalbumin-expressing and fast-spiking. In the CA3 region of the hippocampus, basket cells can often form recurrent inhibition loops with pyramidal cells. Projections from a pyramidal cell will innervate the basket cell, which in turn has a projection back onto the original pyramidal cells. Since basket cells are inhibitory, this generates a closed loop that can help dampen excitatory responses.\n\nIn the cerebellum, the multipolar basket cells have branching dendrites, which are dilated and knotty. Basket cells synapse on the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and make inhibitory synapses with Purkinje cells. Cerebellar basket cell axons fire inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA to Purkinje cell axons, and inhibits the Purkinje cell. Purkinje cells send inhibitory messages to the deep cerebellar nuclei and are responsible for the sole output of motor coordination from the cerebellar cortex. With the work of the basket cell, Purkinje cells do not send the inhibitory response for motor coordination and motor movement occurs.\n\n"}

These flourished under the British Empire in the 19th century, growing to be English-speaking and British oriented.\n\nThese grew into a tight trading and kinship network across Asia with smaller Baghdadi communities being established beyond India in the mid-nineteenth century in Burma, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai. Baghdadi trading outposts were established across colonial Asia with families settling in Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia and Australia. Until the Second World War, these communities attracted a modest flow of Jewish emigrants from Iraq, with smaller numbers hailing from Syria, Egypt, Yemen, Iran, and Turkey.\n\nThe Second World War, brought strife to India, the Japanese occupation of Burma, Hong Kong and Shanghai, then swiftly the end of the British Empire in Asia. Dislocated by war, the violence of the Indian Partition, rising nationalism and the uncertainty of independence in both India and Burma, an exodus began to the newly founded state of Israel, Britain and Australia. Their old trade routes severed by first Communist victory in China, the ocean trade stifled in India and Burma by postcolonial nationalizations and trade restrictions, the Baghdadi Jewish had emigrated almost in their entirety by the 1970s. Families of Baghdadi Jewish descent continue to play a major role in Jewish life, especially in Great Britain where families such as the Sassoons and Reubens have enjoyed great prominence in business and politics.\n\nThough Jewish traders from the Middle East had crossed the Indian Ocean since ancient Rome, sources from the Mughal Empire first mention Jewish merchants from Baghdad trading with India in the 17th century.\n\nIndia was far from unknown to the Jewish merchants of the Middle East. Since ancient Rome the caravan route from India had ended in Aleppo and the spice trade had tied Basra, Yemen and Cairo to the Malabar Coast. However, it was Persian-speaking Jewish merchants, close trading allies of the Jews of Baghdad, Basra and Aleppo Jews who first struck into the Indian heartland.\n\nAs adventurers, mystics and merchants, they had been venturing to India since the Middle Ages on the back of invasions of the subcontinent launched by Persian speaking rulers from what is now Iran and Afghanistan. Both Persian and Mughal sources record Jewish traders following the 16th century Mughal invasion of India launched by Emperor Babur.\n\nThey rose to be traders and courtiers of the Mughals. Jewish advisors at the Court of Akbar the Great in Agra played a significant role in Akbar's liberal religious policies. In Delhi, the syncretic Jewish mystic Sarmad Khasani was tutor to the Crown Prince Dara Shikoh before both were executed by Aurangzeb. There were sufficient Jews in Mughal lands for British travelers to report that synagogues had been established there, but of which no trace or Jewish record remains. These handful of Jews never established a permanent community but left legends and pathways for future settlers from\nArabic speaking lands.\n\nRecords of Jewish tradesmen traveling from Baghdad can be found from the early 17th century. These trading outposts and emerging migrant communities also saw Jews become courtiers to Mughal rulers. These merchants wandered widely across the subcontinent. Shalom Cohen, who would found the Calcutta community, was the court jeweller to the Nawab of Awadh and travelled to Punjab where he held the same title as the court of Ranjit Singh the leader of the Sikh Empire. Cohen, the Calcutta community would later recall, was even given the honour of riding with the Nawab of Awadh in his personal elephant.\n\nThe first permanent Baghdadi merchant colony in India was established in 1730 in Surat, after the British East India Company had begun trading with Basra in 1723. In the early 18th century, trade between Basra and Surat grew whilst the Indian port was the main base of the British East India Company until it decamped to Bombay. Joseph Seemah from Baghdad opened the Surat synagogue and cemetery in 1730. The Baghdadi community in Surat grew and by the end of the 18th century, as many as 100 Jews from Baghdad, Aleppo and Basra made up the Judeo-Arabic speaking merchant colony of Surat. This was to become the first of a string of Baghdadi communities stretching from Bombay to Kobe be established in Asia.\n\nBut it was around the early 19th century, in response to the tyrannical rule of Dawud Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Baghdad, who persecuted, extorted and imprisoned the leading Jewish families of the city, that whole clans started crossing the Indian Ocean to seek safety and fortune in Asia. Dawud Pasha's misrule was when Baghdadi immigration towards Bombay and Calcutta became strong with the leading Sassoon, Ezra and Judah families departing for India. This episode of persecution was the beginning of the Baghdadi Jewish diaspora with records of whole clans departing the city for Bombay, Calcutta, Aleppo, Alexandria and Sydney.\n\nJewish life in the ancient communities of the Middle East, had taken a turn for the worse in the mid 19th century. The pogrom and forced conversion of the Jews of Mashhad in 1839, the fear sown by three blood libels in Aleppo between 1841 and 1860, and the outbreak of plague, first striking Baghdad in 1831, then returning with vengeance to Basra and Baghdad in 1841, encouraged Jewish clans in the declining Ottoman Empire to seek their fortunes elsewhere.\n\nAs Jews, primarily from Baghdad, Basra and Aleppo came to India as traders in the wake of the Portuguese, Dutch and British what became known as the Baghdadi communities grew fast. By the middle of the 19th century trade between Baghdad and India was said to be entirely in Jewish hands. Within a generation Baghdadi Jews had established manufacturing and commercial houses of fabulous wealth, most notably the Sassoon, Ezra, Elias, Belilios, Judah and Meyer families.\n\nWith the rise of British power in India, Surat declined in importance as British-controlled Calcutta and Bombay became more important in trade. Baghdadi settlement shifted first to Bombay and then principally to Calcutta, then the capital of British India and the centre of the jute, muslin, and opium trades. Jewish merchants from Aleppo, traditionally the end of the historic caravan route from India, played an important role in founding the Calcutta Jewish cemetery, which was opened in 1812.\n\nSpurred by the immigration of some the leading Jewish families of Baghdad fleeing the persecution of Dawud Pasha, the first synagogue, replacing a small prayer room, was opened in 1823, and with the community expanding quickly a second followed in 1856. By the end of the 19th century, more than 1,800 Baghdadi Jews were living in Calcutta. In 1884, a third synagogue, which was to be the largest in Asia, was dedicated in Calcutta. Baghdadi Jews were also living and trading in Chinsura and Chandernagore outside Calcutta.\n\nThe rise of colonial Calcutta saw the rise of opium trade with China. British rule turned opium into a global commodity, establishing a monopoly over the sale of Indian opium in 1773, actively promoting its export, defying Chinese drug laws and fighting two wars to open the Chinese market. Baghdadi Jewish merchants dominated the opium trade with a majority of opium chests auctioned from British authorities being exported to China by Baghdadi Jewish merchants, who competed with Marwari and Parsee merchants for the trade. The Sassoon family eventually controlled 70 percent of the opium trade from India. Great fortunes were also made in the indigo, silk and muslin trade with Dhaka where Baghdadi Jews partnered with Bengali Muslim merchants.\n\nAround these booming concerns, the Baghdadi Jewish communities of India began to take shape, both seeking and attracting Jewish immigrants from across the Middle East to work for them. Following the shift in the centre of British rule from Bombay to Bengal the Baghdadi community of Bombay initially lagged that emerging in Calcutta. This fortunes of the community were reversed when David Sassoon and his family arrived in 1833.\n\nSponsored by the Sassoon family, the first synagogue opened in 1861 and the second in 1888. Distinct from Calcutta, whose settlement was principally Iraqi Jews and Syrian Jews, the Baghdadi Jewish community in Bombay drew significant Jewish immigration from Persian-speaking communities in Afghanistan, Bukhara and Iran as well Jewish families from Yemen. Jewish migrant were attracted from across the Middle East to work in the factories and business concerns of the Sassoon family. Outside Bombay a Baghdadi community was established in Poonawhere a synagogue, a school and hospital was established by David Sassoon by and for a Hebrew printing press was in operation. A Baghdadi presence is also recorded in Madras.\n\nFrom India, the community expanded to Burma, and the ports of Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai. These were established along the opium route that ran between India and China. In Singapore the elders of the community were initially the sons of Ezekiel Judah of Calcutta. Meanwhile, the earliest Baghdadi Jew to settle in Burma was Azariah Samuel who arrived in the port of Sittwe on the Bay of Bengal in 1841. Around the same time two brothers Judah and Abraham Raphael Ezekiel settled in Mandalay and worked as bookkeepers for the Burmese royal court. From 1880 the community was permanently established, the trading success of other Baghdadi Jews in opium, teak, jute, and trading shops, attracted other Baghdadi Jews to Mandalay and communities sprang up in Rangoon and Pathein.\n\nFollowing the ban on the opium trade in the early twentieth century Baghdadi Jewish merchants invested in cotton and jute products as staple exports. The sudden spike in demand for jute sandbags, building blocks for the trenches on the Western Front (World War I), made great fortunes amongst the Jewish merchants of Calcutta.\n\nAt their heights, the communities of Bombay and Calcutta were at the heart of a communal kinship network linked by the ports of the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. One observer described the Baghdadi Jews communities as being \"almost as familiar with each other as the Jews of Manchester are with Liverpool.\" The engines of the Baghdadi Jewish trading network were tightly knit family firms such as David Sassoon and Co or the Meyer Brothers, founded by Sir Manasseh Meyer, with offices and agents established by family members in the each port of the network.\n\nBefore World War II there were upwards of 11,000 Baghdadi Jews in Asia. On the eve of war the Baghdadi population in Calcutta had reached 3500 and in Bombay 3000. Across the Bay of Bengal in Burma, both Rangoon and Pathein elected Baghdadi Jewish mayors and the Baghdadi Jewish population peaked at 2500 Jews in the 1930s. However, not all the Baghadi Jewish communities of this era were permanently established with the Judeo-Arabic speaking community in Sydney established by families fleeing Dawud Pasha disbanding its congregation in the 1890s.\n\nThose communities established beyond British India by Baghdadi Jews flourished during the British Empire and peaked in population shortly before the Second World War at 1500 in Singapore, 1000 in Shanghai, and 150 Hong Kong prior to the Second World War. The Singapore community flourished under the leadership of Sir Menasseh Meyer and the Hong Kong community under the influence of E. R. Belilios. Both were opium dealers who engaged in significant philanthropic efforts establishing schools and synagogues. Baghdadi outposts are also recorded as having been established in Canton and Tientsin.\n\nWhilst Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai were the only Baghdadi settlements to genuinely grow into large communities, beyond a small trading outpost, tiny portside settlements existed in Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan, as satellites of the stronger communities in India, Burma, Singapore and China.\n\nOn the route between India and Singapore, a tiny Baghdadi community was in Penang, with a synagogue and Jewish cemetery, was established in the 1870s, but for most of its history never exceeded 50 families. Further south from Singapore, in Indonesia, then the Dutch East Indies, a tiny Baghdadi community of spice merchants was established in Surabaya in Java in the 1880s.\n\nThe most far flung Baghdadi outposts, never numbering more than fifty families, were established in Japan at the furthest reaches of the opium route. Baghdadi Jews from Iraq, Syria and Egypt, initially drawn to man the concessions of David Sassoon established tiny footholds in Nagasaki, Yokohama and Kobe. The only Baghdadi synagogue in Japan, uniting small prayer groups, was Ohel Shelomoh opened by Jews from Aleppo in 1912. Initially established in Nagasaki and Yokohama, the Baghdadi traders relocated to Kobe, which became its focal point, after an earthquake in 1923.\n\nAs imperial jurisdictions consolidated, the Baghdadi Jews found themselves in a liminal situation in colonial Asia. They were considered neither Indian nor Western, brown nor white and partnered with both Western and Indian interests. Legally they lived in limbo, their citizenship often unclear, having inherited what was an early modern political order.\n\nPrior to the First World War the Baghdadi Jews were for the most part notionally subjects of the Ottoman Empire. Starting from 1870 the communal leaders began aggressive lobbying with British colonial authorities to registered as white, British and European. This was never granted to them. Nor was admittance, with few exceptions, to the European only clubs that were the centre of life in the British Empire. Baghdadi Jews were denied access to European electoral rolls in India. Outsiders, and insiders, they clung fiercely to their Jewish identity.\n\nBeyond India, Baghdadi Jews sought the legal status of French or British Protected Person in China. With few exceptions for the wealthiest individuals, this was routinely denied by British officials. Angst over their legal status grew in the run up to World War II.\n\nAs a result, the Baghdadi Jews were determined to prove themselves a loyalist community to British authorities throughout the colonial period. Baghdadi Jewish merchants operated as confidential agents of the East India Company, offered aid to British civilians during the 1756 incident known as the Black Hole of Calcutta, and like many foreign and Indian merchants and maharajas made substantial donations to the British army during the so-called 1857 Indian Mutiny. God Save The Queen, was sung in the honour of the far off imperial sovereign in the schools founded by David Sassoon, who himself never spoke English.\n\nThe Baghdadi Jews, whilst spread across continents, operated a network of kinship and trust throughout the trading posts of the Indian Ocean. They were closely united by religious, language and family ties. Marriage, in particular, tied the Baghdadi communities together. Brides, and occasionally grooms, would be sent from one community to another. Business would often overlap with family ties, creating strong alliances. Synagogues, schools, and special funds, fastened a support networks sponsored by wealthy merchants. This kinship network meant Judeo-Arabic communities, typically established by fellow Jewish migrants from the same families and clans the Middle East, which sprang up in Burma, Singapore, Malaysia and China, were tightly woven into the Baghdadi community.\n\nThe life of the Baghdadi kinship network on the opium route is best seen in the case of Sir Manasseh Meyer. He was born in Baghdad in 1846 and received his primary education of Calcutta, his secondary education in Singapore, before returning to Calcutta to learn bookkeeping and then moving to Rangoon, Burma, to established a small business. From there he returned to Singapore, established an import-export business, based on an opium monopoly with India. He was knighted in 1906 for his services to Singapore having sponsored the building of two synagogues and large scale real estate construction. However, throughout all is movement, he remained firmly within a Judeo-Arabic speaking Baghdadi network.\n\nWithin these Baghdadi communities, the majority were of Iraqi Jewish origin, but families from Syria, Yemen, Egypt, Afghanistan, Iran and a handful of Sephardic Jews from Italy and Turkey joined and assimilated into the Baghdadi community. For most, it was simply as eastern expansion to closely bound patterns of transnational Jewish kinship, trade and exchange that had existed for centuries, moved out of the Middle East and the Mediterranean into colonial Asia. Within the Middle Eastern Jewish world, the Baghdadi Jews were considered adventurers and entrepreneurs.\n\nQuite unlike Ashkenazi Jews departing for America, who were typically poor and scored by their religious elders for doing so, the Middle Eastern Jews who departed for India included some the leading Jewish families of Baghdad, and were looked up as admired figures, patrons, and sponsors of religious life back in Iraq. Both the Sassoon family, which settled in Bombay no later than 1832, and the Judah family, which left for Calcutta in 1825, were seen as the leading Jewish families of Baghdad. Ezekiel Judah, who founded two synagogues in Calcutta, was a descendant of Solomon Ma'tuk.\n\nThese great Baghdadi Jewish fortunes are deceptive, however, when it comes to what life was like for the overwhelming majority of the community. Far from wealthy, they lived on the edge of poverty, as peddlers, stall holders, mill workers, rickshaw men and other such jobs. The middle class Jews speculated in opium and acted as brokers. Great distance existed between the leading Baghdadi Jewish families, such as the Ezra family and the Sassoon family, who grew ever richer and more British-oriented during this period, and the rest of the community. Politically, the Baghdadi Jewish resembled an oligarchy, with all power and authority to represent the community towards colonial authorities being vested in the leading families, as it had been traditionally in the Middle East.\n\nInitially the Baghdadi Jewish communities that developed in India retained close cultural and religious links to Baghdad. Intellectual life was strong enough in the mid to late-19th century to sustain a printed press in India of the Baghdad Jewish dialect of Judeo-Arabic. Centered on Calcutta small Baghdadi Jewish publishing houses translated literary, historical, religious and anti-missionary tracts into Judeo-Arabic whilst religious texts were also printed in Hebrew. Baghdadi newspapers and periodicals in Judeo-Arabic, with some Hebrew portions, were also published in India. This Baghdadi printed press began in 1855: with the support of David Sassoon a periodical started in Bombay catering to the merchant elite of the community. This was joined by four other Baghdadi Judeo-Arabic newspapers and periodicals in Calcutta. Novels and literature from the European Zionist and Haskala movements were translated into Judeo-Arabic in Calcutta. At the turn of the 20th century, Jewish intellectual life in Calcutta appears to have waned.\n\nIn the 20th century Baghdad declined, and the British Empire became more important to the Baghdadi Jews. The wealthier Baghdadis adopted European clothes and sought British education for their children whilst the poorer Baghdadis, especially women, continued to wear Arabic dress. The rise in British education and working in the British Empire resulted in Baghdadi Jews turning to English as their first language, both for international trade and cultural prestige in India. In the 20th century the Baghdadi Jews wanted to assimilate into colonial European society and be considered culturally and ethnically European. Aside for religious observances, the Baghdadi Jews began to adopt elements of Western European lifestyles. But the Baghdadis remained marginal to colonial European society and were excluded for the duration of the Raj from many social clubs that limited admission to Europeans.\n\nSuch Westernization resulted in the closing of all Judeo-Arabic publications in India by the start of the 20th century. These were succeeded in Calcutta in the 1920s and 1940s by three English-language communal newspapers sympathetic to Zionism. Whilst many of the wealthiest Baghdadi families remained aloof from Zionism in the late 19th and early 20th century, the community's middle class established Zionist associations in Bombay and Calcutta.\n\nReligiously the Baghdadi Jews did not train their own rabbis but sought guidance and resolutions on matters of Jewish law from the rabbis of Baghdad, preserving the traditions and rituals of Iraqi Jews. Sermons up until the First World War were given in Judeo-Arabic, after which the use of English became predominant. After the First World War, the Baghdadi Jews began to refer their religious questions to the Sephardic Chief Rabbi in Britain. Rites concerning circumcision, betrothal, and protections of the newborn preserved Iraqi Jewish customs. Baghdadi Jewish wedding celebrations gradually grew less Middle Eastern and more European in style in the 20th century.\n\nThroughout this period, the leading Baghdadi Jewish families set themselves up as sponsors of Mizrahi Jewish religious life in the Middle East. Across Syria and Iraq, schools, synagogues, yeshiva and charitable foundations were supported by Baghdadi Jewish merchants of Bombay and Calcutta. Struggling communities across the Middle East sought the support of patrons in Asia such as when Moise Sassoon of Calcutta was called upon to by Lebanese Jews to sponsor the construction of the Magen Avraham Synagogue of Beirut. Almost all these works were destroyed after the starts or the Israeli-Arab conflict brought about the flight and expulsion of these ancient Jewish communities in Arab lands. Today only the Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem, founded by donations from the Baghdadi Jews of Calcutta, survives.\n\nAs the Second World War saw most of the Baghdadi Jews of Burma, as well as individual families from across Asia, flee from the Japanese Occupation of Burma the Jewish population of Calcutta, the heart of the Baghdadi network, swelled with refugees to over 5,000 strong. A small number of Jews fled the 1941 Farhud pogrom in Baghdad for Bombay. Even some of the leading Baghdadi Jewish families who had settled in Britain, chose to return to India as the Nazi Holocaust began the slaughter of European Jews. Despite India offering this place of refuge, the Second World War was the beginning of the end for old Baghdadi world.\n\nThe Japanese occupation of Burma, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia saw much of the Baghdadi community interned by the Japanese army. As the war ended, it was miraculously revealed to the rest of the Baghdadi world that in Japan itself, Rahmo Sassoon, leader of the tiny Baghdadi Jewish community of Kobe, had skillfully negotiated with Japanese authorities to ensure no Jews were harmed during World War II. Despite this, the one Baghdadi synagogue of Japan, in Kobe was burnt down during an American air raid.\n\nAt the heart of the Baghdadi world, in India, the end of the war ushered in the implosion of the old order. At this point, ethnic strife, political violence and fear of civil war were widespread in India on the eve of Indian Independence. The violent explosion of killings and refugees following the Partition of India exacerbated the Baghdadi fears for the future. Dislocated by war, with many fearing India and Burma would become communist or hostile to business not in Indian hands or Burmese hands once the British left, the Baghdadi community began to leave Asia. Meanwhile, in the Middle East the establishment of the state of Israel and the outbreak of the Arab–Israeli conflict saw the start of the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands. In Iraq, pushed by official intimidation persecution, almost the entirety of the ancient Iraqi Jewish community had left for Israel by 1950.\n\nFirst the leading families, then the rest of the community began to emigrate on mass. This began a continuous exodus from Bombay and Calcutta. The wealthier followed the path of the Sassoon family to Britain, whilst the poorer were drawn to the new state of Israel or the easing of immigration restrictions in Australia. Bombay and Calcutta were the heart of the Baghdadi world, the centers of trade, culture and communal life. Once these had fallen into decline, the outlying communities followed.\n\nPostwar the imperial system and open borders that had made the transnational Baghdadi world possible disappeared. In Shanghai, communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949 closed the trading links community depended upon. Those that has fled the Japanese occupation chose not to return. By 1950, the community had all but vanished. Meanwhile, In Hong Kong, despite the benign conditions of British rule, emigration saw Baghdadi Jewish numbers fall to less than 70 by the 1960s.\n\nIn Burma, independence in 1947 similarly imposed trade barrier and a nationalistic regime in which the Baghdadi Jews felt they had little place. In Singapore, with trade to China, India and Burma blocked, and the Jewish community had shrunk to as low as 180 by the 1960s.\n\nA final wave of emigration, pushing the much reduced communities in India and Burma to virtual extinction, was triggered by a wave of hard left nationalizations and trade restrictions in India and Burma in the 1960s. Elections in West Bengal saw a government dominated by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) take power in Calcutta in 1967. Nationalizations of legacy firms from British rule and currency restrictions saw a choking of economic life and the Baghdadi community shrink from 500 to under 100 by the 1970s. Meanwhile, nationalizations in Burma the 1960s saw the closing of synagogues and the last Rabbi leaving the country in 1969.\n\nDespite this precipitous decline and dispersal of the Baghdadi Jewish communities, a handful of individual Baghdadi Jews would play pivotal roles in Asia's newly independent states. The first First Minister of Singapore David Marshall was a Baghdadi Jew. In India, Lieutenant General J. F. R. Jacob, a Baghdadi Jew from Calcutta, won national fame as Major General and chief of staff of the Indian army that defeated the Pakistan Army in East Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, later serving as governor of the Indian states of Goa and Punjab.\n\nThe Baghdadi community, however, never saw their exodus as a tragedy. Memoirs written by Baghdadi Jewish authors spoke fondly Burma, Singapore, Shanghai and Hong Kong and of the fact in India they had never experienced antisemitism, which was viewed as a unique treasure. The network of Baghdadi Jewish schools, both English, Jewish and aspirational in orientation had primed them for life in Britain or Israel, not in postcolonial Asia. Rather that focus on what pushed, these memoirs focus on what pulled the Baghdadi Jews to leave Asia, chiefly a sense that the opportunities that had drawn their ancestors there had dried up, and new glittering prizes lay in the West.\n\nIn the early twenty first century the Baghdadi communities of India and Burma are at the point of disappearing completely. However small Baghdadi communities of Hong Kong and Singapore have endured and Baghdadi synagogues still operate in both cities, though now greatly outnumbered in both by Jews from especially the United States, Israel, France and the United Kingdom draw to business in contemporary Asia.\n\nToday synagogues and associations upholding Baghdadi Jewish traditions exist in Britain, Israel, Australia and the United States. But in the historic Baghdadi communities in Asia only the synagogues originally founded by Baghdadi Jews in both Hong Kong and Singapore continue to operate regular services.\n\nFamilies of Baghdadi Jewish descent continue to play a major role in Jewish life particularly in Great Britain, to which the leading families were draw after the Second World War. Established in London, the Sassoon family enjoyed the friendship of Edward VII, established a baronetcy and saw Philip Sasson became a minister. Meanwhile, other Baghdadi families such as the Reubens have played major role in British business whilst others have gained notable prominence in arts and journalism, such as Gerry Judah and Tim Judah.\n\nTraditional Baghdadi Jewish cuisine is a hybrid cuisine, with many Arab, Turkish, Persian and Indian influences. Famous Baghdadi dishes include beef curry, Baghdadi biryani and Baghdadi Jewish parathas. A Baghdadi version of tandoori chicken is also popular (using lemon juice to cook the chicken instead of the cream used in the usual Indian recipe). Other Baghdadi Jewish communities in Southeast Asia mixed their original Iraqi Jewish dishes with influences from the local cuisine.\n\nPre-World War Two Baghdadi Communities in Asia\n\nPost-World War Two wider Baghdadi and Iraqi Jewish Diaspora.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2206127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206127", "title": "Morgan's Raid", "text": "Morgan's Raid\n\nMorgan's Raid was a diversionary incursion by Confederate cavalry into the northern (Union) states of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and, briefly, West Virginia, during the American Civil War. The raid took place from June 11–July 26, 1863, and is named for the commander of the Confederates, Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan. Although it caused temporary alarm in the North, the raid was ultimately classed as a failure.\n\nThe raid covered more than , beginning in Tennessee and ending in northern Ohio. It coincided with the Vicksburg Campaign and the Gettysburg Campaign, and it was meant to draw U.S. troops away from these fronts by frightening the North into demanding their troops return home. Despite his initial successes, Morgan was thwarted in his attempts to recross the Ohio River and eventually was forced to surrender what remained of his command in northeastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania border. Morgan and other senior officers were kept in the Ohio state penitentiary, but they tunneled their way out and took a train to Cincinnati, where they crossed the Ohio River to safety.\n\nGeneral Morgan and his 2,460 handpicked Confederate cavalrymen, along with 4 artillery pieces, departed from Sparta, Tennessee, on June 11, 1863, intending to divert the attention of the Union Army of the Ohio from Southern forces in the state and possibly stir up pro-southern sentiments in the North. Gen. Braxton Bragg, the regional Confederate commander, had intended for Morgan's cavalrymen to provide a distraction by entering Kentucky. Morgan, however, confided to some of his officers that he had long desired to invade Indiana and Ohio to bring the terror of war to the North. Bragg had given him \"carte blanche\" to ride throughout Tennessee and Kentucky, but ordered him to under no circumstances cross the Ohio River. On June 23, the Federal Army of the Cumberland began its operations against General Bragg's Confederate Army of Tennessee in what became known as the Tullahoma Campaign, and Morgan decided it was time to move northward into Kentucky.\n\nOn July 2, hoping to disrupt Union communication lines, Morgan rode into Kentucky, where admiring citizens openly welcomed his cavalrymen. Crossing the rain-swollen Cumberland River at Burkesville, Morgan's division advanced to the Green River, where it was deflected by half of a Union regiment (the 25th Michigan Infantry) at the Battle of Tebbs Bend on July 4. Morgan soon surprised and captured the garrison at Lebanon. He trapped 400 men from the 20th Kentucky in the town's railroad depot, but the well-fortified building provided considerable protection. In a sharp six-hour fight, Federal troops killed Morgan's youngest brother Thomas during the final charge. Morgan finally captured and paroled the Federal troops.\nA grieving Morgan continued northward towards Louisville, riding through Springfield, Bardstown, and Garnettsville. Along the way, the Confederates endured several more small skirmishes with Federals and Kentucky home guard units. Just south of the city, however, he turned his remaining men to the northwest and headed for the Ohio River.\n\nAt Springfield, Morgan sent a detachment north and east of Louisville, with the intention of confusing Union forces as to where Morgan was really heading. This detachment crossed the Ohio River at Twelve Mile Island, but they were captured near New Pekin, Indiana, before they could rejoin Morgan. To further mislead the Federals on his objectives, Morgan had his telegrapher, \"Lightning\" Ellsworth, tap telegraph lines and, pretending to be a Union telegrapher, send several messages giving different headings for the raiders and false reports of the size of Morgan's force—sometimes reporting it as high as 7,000 men. Ellsworth did this throughout the journey, especially in Indiana.\n\nMorgan had sent spy Thomas Hines and a party of 25 Confederates (posing as a Union patrol) on a secret mission into Indiana in June to determine if the local Copperheads would support or join Morgan's impending raid. After visiting the local Copperhead leader, Dr. William A. Bowles, Hines learned that no desired support would be forthcoming. He and his scouts were soon identified as actually being Confederates, and, in a small skirmish near Leavenworth, Indiana, Hines had to abandon his men as he swam across the Ohio River under gunfire. He wandered around Kentucky for a week seeking information on Morgan's whereabouts.\n\nBy now reduced to 1,800 men, Morgan's main column had arrived on the morning of July 8 at Brandenburg, Kentucky, a small town along the Ohio River, where Hines rejoined them. Here, the raiders seized two steamboats, the \"John B. McCombs\" and the \"Alice Dean\". Morgan, against Bragg's strict orders, transported his command across the river to Indiana, landing just east of Mauckport. A small company of Indiana home guards contested the crossing with an artillery piece, as did a riverboat carrying a six-pounder. Morgan chased off the local defenders, capturing a sizeable portion as well as their guns. After burning the \"Alice Dean\" and sending the \"John B. McCombs\" downriver with instructions not to pursue him, Morgan headed away from the river.\n\nGovernor Oliver P. Morton worked feverishly to organize Indiana's defense, calling for able-bodied men to take up arms and form militia companies. Thousands responded and organized themselves into companies and regiments. Col. Lewis Jordan took command of the 450 members of the Harrison County Home Guard (Sixth Regiment, Indiana Legion), consisting of poorly trained civilians with a motley collection of arms. His goal was to delay Morgan long enough for Union reinforcements to arrive.\n\nMaj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, commander of the Department of the Ohio with headquarters in Cincinnati, quickly organized local Federal troops and home militia to cut off Morgan's routes back to the South. Morgan headed northward on Mauckport Road, with another brother, Col. Richard Morgan, leading the forward elements. On July 9, one mile south of Corydon, Indiana, the county seat of Harrison County, his advance guard encountered Jordan's small force, drawn in a battle line behind a hastily thrown up barricade of logs. The colonel attacked, and in a short but spirited battle of less than an hour, he simultaneously outflanked both Union wings, completely routing the hapless militia. Accounts vary as to the number of casualties of the Battle of Corydon, but the most reliable evidence suggests that 4 of Jordan's men were killed, 10-12 were wounded, and 355 were captured. Morgan counted 11 dead and 40 wounded raiders. Among the dead Federals was the civilian toll keeper who perished near his tollgate. Raiders killed a Lutheran minister, Reverend Peter Glenn, on his farm, from the battlefield, and stole horses from several other farmers.\n\nGeneral Morgan led his division into Corydon, where he paroled his demoralized prisoners and ransomed the town for cash and supplies. Morgan's soldiers then traveled east and reached Vienna on July 10, where they burned a railroad bridge and depot, and tapped a telegraph line. After spending the night in Lexington, they headed to the northeast, terrorizing the small towns along the way, including Vernon, Dupont, New Pekin, Salem, and Versailles.\n\nIn Versailles a group of freebooters invaded the local Masonic Lodge, Versailles No. 7, and lifted the Lodge's badges of office which had originally been made from French silver coins. Morgan, himself a Freemason, ordered the officers' jewels returned, punishing the thievery of his own men.\n\nOn July 11, while crossing Blue River near New Pekin, Confederate Capt. William J. Davis and some of his men were captured by 73rd Indiana Infantry and a detachment of the 5th U.S. Regulars. Davis and several other soldiers were taken to New Albany and secured in the county jail.\n\nOn July 12, Morgan arrived in the town of Dupont, Indiana, where his men burned the town's storehouse and stole 2,000 smoked hams before riding out of town the next day. The hams were eventually discarded as they began to attract flies, leaving a trail of hams along the side of the road for the pursuing Union Army to follow.\n\nMorgan then headed for Salem where he immediately took possession of the town and placed guards over the stores and streets. His cavalrymen burned the large brick depot, along with all the railcars on the track and the railroad bridges on each side of town. They demanded taxes from area flour and grist mills. After looting stores and taking about $500, they departed in the afternoon. Morgan finally left Indiana at Harrison, closely pursued by Federal cavalry.\n\nThe Confederates entered Ohio on July 13, destroying bridges, railroads, and government stores. Morgan's Raid spread alarm across southern and central Ohio, and wild speculation as to his destination. \"Harper's Weekly\", a leading Northern newspaper, reported:\nSidestepping Burnside's forces that protected Cincinnati to the south he traveled through such northern communities as Harrison, New Baltimore, Colerain, Springdale, Glendale and Sharonville. Morgan and his men ran into great resistance when trying to capture Camp Dennison. He would eventually retreat and regroup with the other column of his men in Montgomery and bypass Camp Dennison through Wards Corner. Morgan continued east to the Ohio River where, just north of modern Ravenswood, West Virginia, there was a ford at Buffington Island that would allow him to cross over into that state. Burnside correctly guessed Morgan's intentions. Federal columns under Edward H. Hobson and Henry M. Judah and river gunboats swiftly converged to contest any river crossing. Burnside also sent a militia regiment from Marietta, Ohio, to hold the ford until the Federal forces could arrive. Morgan arrived on the evening of July 18, but decided not to attack the militia in the gathering darkness. It proved to be a mistake.\n\nBy morning, the cavalry and gunboats had arrived, blocking Morgan's escape route. At the subsequent Battle of Buffington Island in Ohio, Union troops won a decisive victory and captured 750 of Morgan's men, including his brother Richard and noted cavalryman Col. Basil W. Duke. Cut off from safety by the Union gunboats, Morgan and his remaining cavaliers headed northeast back into Ohio. A second attempt at crossing upriver (opposite Belleville, West Virginia) also failed, with several of Morgan's men drowning in the swirling river as the gunboats and Union cavalry again drove off the raiders. Col. Adam \"Stovepipe\" Johnson and over 300 raiders did escape into West Virginia and safety, but General Morgan chose to remain on the Ohio side with the rest of his dwindling force. He was turned away at skirmishes in Gallia County at Coal Hill and Hockingport, losing more of his force.\n\nAs Morgan with 400 remaining men headed away from the river into the interior of southern Ohio, he paused at Nelsonville, a small town on the Hocking Canal. His men burned ten wooden canal boats and set a covered bridge ablaze to slow their pursuers. However, as soon as Morgan's raiders rode off, citizens rushed to save the burning span. Two hours later, Union cavalry arrived, delighted to find that the townspeople had prepared a feast for them.\n\nWith his men somewhat rested on Weaver's homestead near Triadelphia on the 22nd of July, and guided down Island Run by John Weaver who was held hostage, Morgan forded the broad Muskingum River at Eaglesport, just south of Zanesville, before turning northward in Guernsey County. He still hoped to cross the Ohio River at some point and head through West Virginia to safety. At the village of Old Washington, Morgan's weary men fought a skirmish in the streets before hastily departing, pursued by Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. James M. Shackelford. On July 26, Union forces defeated Morgan at the Battle of Salineville and finally caught him that afternoon near West Point in Columbiana County. They were held in Wellsville, Ohio, then taken to the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus rather than to a prisoner-of-war camp, because of reports that captured Union officers had received similar treatment. Many of his enlisted men ended up in the Camp Douglas stockade in Chicago.\n\nThe general and six officers made a daring escape on November 27 by tunneling from an air shaft beneath their cells into the prison yard and scaling the walls. Only two of Morgan's men were recaptured, and he and the rest soon returned to the South. Morgan was killed less than a year later in Greeneville, Tennessee, by a Union cavalryman after refusing to halt while attempting to escape.\n\nDuring his daring raid, Morgan and his men captured and paroled about 6,000 Union soldiers and militia, destroyed 34 bridges, disrupted the railroads at more than 60 places, and diverted tens of thousands of troops from other duties. He spread terror throughout the region, and seized thousands of dollars worth of supplies, food, and other items from local stores, houses, and farms. Since the timing somewhat coincided with the Gettysburg Campaign and raids towards Pittsburgh by John D. Imboden's cavalry, many assumed at the time that Morgan's Raid was part of a coordinated effort to threaten the Ohio River commerce and spread the war to the North. Few in the North realized that Morgan's adventure was a violation of his orders and had nothing to do with Robert E. Lee's simultaneous movement into Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Ohio alone, approximately 2,500 horses were stolen and nearly 4,375 homes and businesses were raided. Morgan's Raid cost Ohio taxpayers nearly $600,000 in damages and over $200,000 in wages paid to the 49,357 Ohioans called up to man 587 companies of local militia.\n\nTo Morgan's men, the long raid had accomplished much, despite their military defeat and high casualties. Col. Basil Duke later wrote, \"The objects of the raid were accomplished. General Bragg's retreat was unmolested by any flanking forces of the enemy, and I think that military men, who will review all the facts, will pronounce that this expedition delayed for weeks the fall of East Tennessee, and prevented the timely reinforcement of Rosecrans by troops that would otherwise have participated in the Battle of Chickamauga.\"\n\nTo many Confederates, the daring expedition behind enemy lines became known as The Great Raid of 1863, and was initially hailed in the newspapers. However, along with Gettysburg and Vicksburg, it was another in a string of defeats for the Confederate army that summer. Some Northern newspapers derisively labeled Morgan's expedition as The Calico Raid, in reference to the raiders' propensity for procuring personal goods from local stores and houses.\n\nKentucky and Indiana have well-marked John Hunt Morgan Heritage Trails that allow tourists to follow the route of Morgan's Raid through their states, along with websites and written tour guides. In November 2001, the State of Ohio placed a John Hunt Morgan historical marker on the site of the Ohio State Penitentiary, remembering his imprisonment and daring escape. An equestrian statue of General Morgan was erected and dedicated in 1910 in downtown Lexington, Kentucky. Ohio's plans for a similar formal trail finally came to fruition in 2013, when the state erected over 600 directional markers and 56 interpretive signs commemorating the route and the important incidents of the raid. Signage was installed during the spring and summer of 2013, in the months leading up to the 150th anniversary of the \"Great Raid.\"\n\nOn the weekend of July 27–28, 2013, communities in Carroll, Jefferson, and Columbiana County, Ohio, held a driving tour to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the raid, with a Civil War era church service, the dedication of a Morgan's Raid Heritage Trail tablet to mark the location of the fighting at Sharp's farm, and events in towns on and near the raid route.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2206140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206140", "title": "Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde", "text": "Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde\n\nDr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde is the seventh album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released in March 1969 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1969 in music). The album was produced by Bob Johnston and saw the band juxtaposing country rock material with psychedelic rock, giving the album a stylistic split-personality that was alluded to in its title. It was the first album to feature the new band line-up of Clarence White (guitar), Gene Parsons (drums), John York (bass), and founding member Roger McGuinn (guitar). \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" is unique within the band's discography for being the only album on which McGuinn sings the lead vocal on every track.\n\nThe album peaked at number 153 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs album chart and reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. A preceding single, \"Bad Night at the Whiskey\" (b/w \"Drug Store Truck Drivin' Man\"), was released on January 7, 1969, but it failed to chart in the United States or in the United Kingdom. In addition, a non-album single featuring a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Lay Lady Lay\", which was recorded shortly after the release of \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" and also produced by Johnston, peaked at number 132 on the \"Billboard\" chart. \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" is the lowest charting album of the band's career in the United States, edging out the later \"Farther Along\" by one place.\n\nFollowing the departure of Gram Parsons from the band, lead guitarist Roger McGuinn and bass player Chris Hillman decided that they needed to find a replacement member to meet their forthcoming concert obligations. With an appearance at the Newport Pop Festival looming, McGuinn and Hillman moved quickly to recruit noted session guitarist and longtime Byrd-in-waiting, Clarence White. White, who had played as a session musician on the Byrds' previous three albums, was invited to join the band as a full-time member in July 1968. After the Newport Pop Festival appearance, White began to express dissatisfaction with the band's drummer, Kevin Kelley, and soon persuaded McGuinn and Hillman to replace Kelley with Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram), a friend of White's from their days together in the band Nashville West. \n\nThe new McGuinn, Hillman, White and Parsons line-up of the band was together for less than a month before Hillman departed to form the Flying Burrito Brothers with Gram Parsons. John York, a session musician who had toured with Johnny Rivers and the Mamas & the Papas, was hired as his replacement on bass. The new band line-up, featuring McGuinn and White's dual guitar work, was regarded by critics and audiences as much more accomplished in concert than any previous configuration of the Byrds had been.\n\nAmidst so many changes in band personnel, McGuinn decided that he alone would sing lead vocals on the band's new album, to give it a sense of sonic unity. McGuinn felt that it would be too confusing for fans of the Byrds to have the unfamiliar voices of the new members coming forward at this stage and so White, Parsons and York were relegated to backing vocal duties during the recording of the album. As a result, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" is the only album in the Byrds' catalogue to feature McGuinn singing lead on every track.\n\nPrior to the recording of the album, the Byrds' record producer, Gary Usher, who had worked on the band's three previous albums, had been fired by Columbia Records for spending too much money on the recording of the Chad & Jeremy album \"Of Cabbages and Kings\". Faced with the need to find a replacement producer, the band elected to bring in Bob Johnston, who had been Bob Dylan's producer since 1965. Ultimately, the band were unhappy with Johnston's work on \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" and, as a result, it was the only Byrds' album to be produced by him. Johnston was employed once more as the band's producer on their May 1969 non-album single, \"Lay Lady Lady\". In that instance he incurred the band's wrath by overdubbing a female choir on to the recording, allegedly without the Byrds' consent. When the single then stalled at number 132 on the \"Billboard\" charts the band decided that they would not work with Johnston again.\n\nRecording sessions for the album began on October 7, 1968, with nine songs intended for the album being recorded during that month. Among these songs were \"Nashville West\", an instrumental written by Parsons and White during their tenure with the country rock group of the same name, and \"Your Gentle Way of Loving Me\", a song that Parsons and Gib Guilbeau had previously released as a single in 1967.\n\nAnother song recorded during these sessions was McGuinn's \"King Apathy III\", a comment on political apathy and a championing of the rural idyll as an antidote to the excesses of the L.A. rock scene. The October recording sessions also saw the band attempting the traditional song \"Old Blue\", which McGuinn had originally learned from watching Bob Gibson and Bob Camp at Chicago's Gate of Horn club back in April 1961. \"Old Blue\" is the first of three dog-related songs to be recorded by the Byrds: the second and third being \"Fido\" from the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" and \"Bugler\" from \"Farther Along\". \"Old Blue\" features the first appearance on a Byrds' recording of the Parsons and White designed StringBender, an invention that allowed White to duplicate the sound of a pedal steel guitar on his Fender Telecaster. \n\nThe October recording sessions also yielded \"Bad Night at the Whiskey\", a song that would go on to be issued as the A-side of a single two months before the album. Named after a disappointing gig at the Whisky a Go Go and co-written by Joey Richards, a friend of McGuinn's, \"Bad Night at the Whiskey\" featured allusive lyrics that bore little or no relationship to the song's title.\n\nThe Byrds also recorded a version of Dylan and Rick Danko's \"This Wheel's on Fire\" during the October 1968 sessions, but this version of the song was not included on the album. \"Stanley's Song\", written by McGuinn and his friend Robert J. Hippard also dates from these sessions, but it was eventually discarded and did not appear in the final track listing for \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\". \nAnother composition recorded during the October 1968 sessions was the McGuinn and Gram Parsons penned \"Drug Store Truck Drivin' Man\". The song had been written by the pair in London in May 1968, before Parsons' departure from the band, and was inspired by the hostility shown towards the Byrds by legendary Nashville DJ Ralph Emery when they appeared on his WSM radio program. The song's barbed lyric contains a volley of Redneck stereotypes, set to a classic country 3/4 time signature and begins with the couplet, \"He's a drug store truck drivin' man/He's the head of the Ku Klux Klan.\" Emery was not, in fact, a Klansman. The song was subsequently performed by Joan Baez at the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and dedicated to the then-governor of California, Ronald Reagan. Baez's performance of the song also appeared on the \"\" album.\n\nAn acetate version of \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", dated October 16, 1968, and containing a seven-track programme for the album is known to exist. At this point the album consisted of the songs \"Old Blue\", \"King Apathy III\", \"Drug Store Truck Drivin' Man\" and \"This Wheel's on Fire\" on side one, with \"Your Gentle Way of Loving Me\", \"Nashville West\" and \"Bad Night at the Whiskey\" on side two.\n\nThe Byrds returned to the studio on December 4, 1968, to re-record \"This Wheel's on Fire\". The Byrds also revisited two songs that had been written for the 1968 film \"Candy\". Of these two songs, \"Child of the Universe\", written by McGuinn and soundtrack composer Dave Grusin, was used in the film, while the McGuinn—York penned title track was not. A medley featuring the Dylan-authored Byrds' hit \"My Back Pages\", along with an instrumental named \"B.J. Blues\" and a jam version of the blues standard \"Baby What You Want Me to Do\" was also recorded during this December recording session.\n\n\"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" was released on March 5, 1969, in the United States (catalogue item CS 9755) and April 25, 1969, in the United Kingdom (catalogue item 63545 in mono, S 63545 in stereo). Like the Byrds' previous LP, \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\", the album was issued exclusively in stereo in America, but appeared in both mono and stereo variations in the UK. Sales of \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" were poor in the U.S., causing it to stall at number 153 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart and giving the album the dubious honor of being the lowest charting album of the band's career, edging out the later \"Farther Along\" by just one place. The album fared better in the United Kingdom, however, where it reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. The \"Bad Night at the Whiskey\" single was released ahead of the album on January 7, 1969, but it failed to reach the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 or the UK Singles Chart. \nThe album's title, along with the back cover photo sequence, which featured the band changing from astronaut flight suits into cowboy garb, illustrated the schizophrenic nature of the album's material. The psychedelic rock of \"Bad Night at the Whiskey\" and \"This Wheel's on Fire\" sat alongside the Bakersfield-style country rock of \"Nashville West\" and \"Drug Store Truck Drivin' Man\". Despite containing only ten tracks, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" is the Byrds' longest single album, clocking in at approximately thirty-five minutes in length. Only the double album \"(Untitled)\" is longer.\n\nThe album was released to generally positive reviews, with famed rock critic Robert Christgau declaring the album \"first-rate Byrds, a high recommendation.\" Johanna Schrier, writing in \"The Village Voice\", described the album as \"smooth and strong like a blended whiskey\", before suggesting that it was \"Part kin to \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\", part the acid offspring of \"Notorious Byrd Brothers\".\" In the UK, \"Record Mirror\" awarded the album four stars out of five, commenting \"British devotes will dig this more than \"Sweetheart\".\" \"Disc\" magazine were particularly enthusiastic in their praise of the album, stating \"[This is] their best album since perhaps \"Younger Than Yesterday\", perfectly illustrating the two completely disparate sides of the group: far-out electronic rock and hick, twangy country.\"\n\nIn more recent times, critic Mark Deming has stated in his review for the Allmusic website that the album \"proved there was still life left in the Byrds, but also suggested that they hadn't gotten back to full speed yet.\" Senior editor of \"Rolling Stone\", David Fricke, has described the album as \"the Great Forgotten Byrds album\", while also noting that it \"seemed tame in its reliance on the familiar.\" \n\n\"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" was remastered at 20-bit resolution as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series. It was reissued in an expanded form on March 25, 1997, with five bonus tracks, including the outtake \"Stanley's Song\". Also included among the bonus tracks were alternate versions of \"This Wheel's on Fire\" and \"Nashville West\", as well as the band's cover of \"Lay Lady Lay\", which was issued as a single some months after the release of the album. However, in the version included here, \"Lay Lady Lay\" is lacking the female backing chorus that had originally appeared on the single release. \n\nThere has been some discussion amongst fans of the Byrds as to whether or not \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" was remixed for its expanded reissue in 1997. Although the producer of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds' series, Bob Irwin, has stated that only the first four Byrds' albums underwent any remixing, some fans of the band maintain that \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\" was also remixed, citing distinct differences between the 1997 reissue and the original album. Among the differences found on the reissue are a lessening of reverb on many songs, the appearance of the spoken word \"three\" over the opening seconds of \"This Wheel's on Fire\", and a longer, unedited version of \"Candy\" appearing on the album for the first time.\n\nAdapted from \"The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited\" and \"So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)\".\n\nThe Byrds\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2206152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206152", "title": "Leptospira", "text": "Leptospira\n\nLeptospira (Greek \"leptos\", \"fine, thin\" and Latin \"spira\", \"coil\") is a genus of spirochaete bacteria, including a small number of pathogenic and saprophytic species. \"Leptospira\" was first observed in 1907 in kidney tissue slices of a leptospirosis victim who was described as having died of \"yellow fever.\"\n\n\"Leptospira\", together with the genera \"Leptonema\" and \"Turneria\", is a member of the family Leptospiraceae. The genus \"Leptospira\" is divided into 20 species based on DNA hybridization studies.\n\nPathogenic \"Leptospira\"\n\nIntermediates or opportunistic \"Leptospira\"\n\nNon-pathogenic \"Leptospira\"\n\nMembers of \"Leptospira\" are also grouped into serovars according to their antigenic relatedness. There are currently over 200 recognized serovars. A few serovars are found in more than one species of \"Leptospira\".\n\nAt its 2002 meeting, the Committee on the Taxonomy of Leptospira of the International Union of Microbiological Societies approved the following nomenclature for serovars of Leptospira. Genus and species names are italicized as usual, with the serovar name not italicized and with an upper case first letter.\n\nFor example:\n\n\nThe currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI),\nand the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 123 by 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project.\n\nAlthough over 200 serotypes of \"Leptospira\" have been described, all members of the genus have similar morphology. \"Leptospira\" are spiral-shaped bacteria that are 6-20 μm long and 0.1 μm in diameter with a wavelength of about 0.5 μm. One or both ends of the spirochete are usually hooked. Because they are so thin, live \"Leptospira\" are best observed by darkfield microscopy.\n\nThe bacteria have a number of degrees of freedom; when ready to proliferate via binary fission, the bacterium noticeably bends in the place of the future split.\n\n\"Leptospira\" have a Gram-negative-like cell envelope consisting of a cytoplasmic and outer membrane. However, the peptidoglycan layer is associated with the cytoplasmic rather than the outer membrane, an arrangement that is unique to spirochetes. The two flagella of \"Leptospira\" extend from the cytoplasmic membrane at the ends of the bacterium into the periplasmic space and are necessary for the motility of \"Leptospira\".\n\nThe outer membrane contains a variety of lipoproteins and transmembrane outer membrane proteins. As expected, the protein composition of the outer membrane differs when comparing \"Leptospira\" growing in artificial medium with \"Leptospira\" present in an infected animal. Several leptospiral outer membrane proteins have been shown to attach to the host extracellular matrix and to factor H. These proteins may be important for adhesion of \"Leptospira\" to host tissues and in resisting complement, respectively.\n\nThe outer membrane of \"Leptospira\", like those of most other Gram-negative bacteria, contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Differences in the highly immunogenic LPS structure account for the numerous serovars of \"Leptospira\". Consequently, immunity is serovar specific; current leptospiral vaccines, which consist of one or several serovars of \"Leptospira\" endemic in the population to be immunized, protect only against the serovars contained in the vaccine preparation. Leptospiral LPS has low endotoxin activity. An unusual feature of leptospiral LPS is that it activates host cells via TLR2 rather than TLR4. The unique structure of the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule may account for this observation. Finally, the LPS O antigen content of \"L. interrogans\" differs in an acutely infected versus a chronically infected animal. The role of O antigen changes in the establishment or maintenance of acute or chronic infection, if any, is unknown.\n\n\"Leptospira\", both pathogenic and saprophytic, can occupy diverse environments, habitats and life cycles; these bacteria are found throughout the world, except in Antarctica. High humidity and neutral (6.9–7.4) pH are necessary for their survival in the environment, with stagnant water reservoirs—bogs, shallow lakes, ponds, puddles, etc.—being the natural habitat for the bacteria.\n\n\"Leptospira\" are typically cultivated at 30 °C in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium, which can be supplemented with 0.21% rabbit serum to enhance growth of fastidious strains. Growth of pathogenic \"Leptospira\" in an artificial nutrient environment such as EMJH becomes noticeable in 4–7 days; growth of saprophytic strains occur within 2–3 days. The minimal growth temperature of pathogenic species is 13–15 °C. Because the minimal growth temperature of the saprophytes is 5–10 °C, the ability of \"Leptospira\" to grow at 13 °C can be used to distinguish saprophytic from pathogenic \"Leptospira\" species. The optimal pH for growth of \"Leptospira\" is 7.2–7.6.\n\n\"Leptospira\" are aerobes whose major carbon and energy source during \"in vitro\" growth is long-chain fatty acids, which are metabolized by beta-oxidation. Fatty acids are provided in EMJH in the form of Tween. Fatty acid molecules are bound by albumin in EMJH and are released slowly into the medium to prevent its toxic accumulation.\n\nLike most bacteria, \"Leptospira\" require iron for growth. \"L. interrogans\" and \"L. biflexa\" have the ability to acquire iron in different forms. A TonB-dependent receptor required for utilization of the ferrous form of the iron has been identified in \"L. biflexa\", and an ortholog of the receptor is encoded in the genome of \"L. interrogans\". \"L. interrogans\" can also obtain iron from heme, which is bound to most of the iron in the human body. The HbpA hemin-binding protein, which may be involved in the uptake of hemin, has been identified on the surface of \"L. interrogans\" Although other pathogenic species of \"Leptospira\" and \"L. biflexa\" lack HbpA, yet another hemin-binding protein, LipL41, may account for their ability to use hemin as a source of iron. Although they do not secrete siderophores, \"L. biflexa\" and \"L. interrogans\" may be capable of obtaining iron from siderophores secreted by other microorganisms.\n\nThe genome of pathogenic \"Leptospira\" consists of two chromosomes. The size of the genomes of \"L. interrogans\" serovars Copenhageni and Lai is approximately 4.6 Mb. However, the genome of \"L. borgpetersenii\" serovar Hardjo is only 3.9 Mb in size with a large number of pseudogenes, gene fragments, and insertion sequences relative to the genomes of \"L. interrogans.\" \"L. interrogans\" and \"L. borgpetersenii\" share 2708 genes from which 656 are pathogenic specific genes. The guanine plus cytosine (GC) content is between 35% and 41%. \"L. borgpetersenii\" serovar Hardjo is usually transmitted by direct exposure to infected tissues, whereas \"L. interrogans\" is often acquired from water or soil contaminated by the urine of carrier animals harboring \"Leptospira\" in their kidneys. The high number of defective genes and insertion sequences in \"L. borgpetersenii\" Hardjo together with the poor survival outside of the host and difference in transmission patterns compared to \"L. interrogans\" suggest that \"L. borgpetersenii\" is undergoing insertion-sequence mediated genomic decay, with ongoing loss of genes necessary for survival outside of the host animal.\n\nGenome sequence determination several strains of \"Leptospira\" lead to the development of multilocus VNTR (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for species level identification of pathogenic \"Leptospira\" species. Both methods hold the potential to replace the highly ambiguous serotyping method currently in vogue for leptospiral strain identification.\n\n\n"}

The first totalisator machine in the world was installed at Ellerslie Racecourse in 1913, see Sir George Julius).\n\nThoroughbred racing with the associated aspects such as horse breeding, training and care, race betting, race-day management and entertainment has gradually developed into an industry worth billions of dollars. The governing body is the New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing Incorporated. \n\nThoroughbred racing is held throughout New Zealand, including courses in some of the smaller centres.\n\nFor further prominent people in New Zealand thoroughbred racing, see the list of honorees of the New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1977 the New Zealand Racing Conference accepted female jockeys and they became eligible to ride on 15 July 1978. Previously Linda Jones was the first to apply for an apprentice’s licence and be turned down. She had ridden in a number of lady riders events over many years in New Zealand and overseas such as in Brazil, which highlighted that New Zealand and Australia were outliers in not allowing women to compete with male jockeys in professional races. \n\nThe first win by a woman in New Zealand was visiting Canadian jockey Joan Phipps, at Te Awamutu in November 1977. Sue Day from Christchurch became the first New Zealand female jockey winner in a totalisator race against males on 22 July 1978 when she won with the Ned Thistoll-trained Jaws in the Waybrook Handicap at Timaru. Other female riders then included Joanne Hale, Vivienne Kaye, Joanne Lamond and Cherie Saxon. \n\nLinda Jones’ first win was on Big Bickies at Te Rapa and soon after Royal Petite was the first Open Handicap winner for a female jockey. Subsequent highlight wins for Linda were Lovaro in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap and Holy Toledo in the Wellington Derby (possibly the first female jockey world-wide to win a Derby). Linda Jones was also the first female jockey to win a professional race against males at a registered meeting in Australia (Doomben).\n\nAlthough there was resistance from some industry participants, the above female jockeys and those that followed competed with great skill and success. It is fair to say most of the gender-related barriers are now long gone. Other female riders of note include:\n\nFemale riders have subsequently gone on to win the New Zealand premiership; Lisa Cropp (2005-2007), Lisa Allpress (2012, 2016 and 2019) and Samantha Collett (2018).\n\nIn late February 2020 Lisa Allpress was the first female to win a thoroughbred race in Saudi Arabia on the horse Matmon at King Abdullah Aziz racetrack in Riyadh. She was competing in the inaugural International jockeys challenge in which she competed with 14 other jockeys including 7 women. The challenge was won by American Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith, Swiss-born Germany based Sibylle Vogt was second while Lisa was third equal with French jockey Mickaelle Michel.\n\nThe following contains details of some of the top New Zealand horses. As well as those winning major races within New Zealand, locally owned and/or trained horses frequently go to Australia for racing campaigns or permanently due to the higher stake money in that country. \n\nBetween 1882 and New Zealand-bred horses won Australia's Melbourne Cup 43 times. During the 2008-09 racing season 19 New Zealand-bred Thoroughbreds won 22 Group One races around the world.\n\nHorses may also go to Asia (mainly Hong Kong or Singapore) or on occasions to Europe or the United States.\n\n! width=\"80px\" | Horse<br>\n! width=\"80px\" | Sire<br>\n! width=\"80px\" | Dam<br>\n! width=\"100px\" | Trainer(s)<br>\n! width=\"380px\" | Notable victories or achievements <br>\n"}

The Langford family later moved to the Mulberry area, a tiny community near Lakeland, where Frances grew up. She graduated from Lakeland High School and studied music at Florida Southern College, also in Lakeland. She was a diminutive five-foot-one-inch (155 cm) tall.\n\nLangford originally trained as an opera singer. While a young girl she required a tonsillectomy that changed her soprano range to a rich contralto. As a result, she was forced to change her vocal approach to a more contemporary big band, popular music style. At age 17, she was singing for local dances. Cigar manufacturer Eli Witt heard her sing at an American Legion party and hired her to sing on a local radio show he sponsored. After a brief stint in the Broadway musical \"Here Goes the Bride\" in 1931, she moved to Hollywood, appearing on the Louella Parsons' radio show \"'Hollywood Hotel' while starting a movie career. Singing for radio during the early 1930s she was heard by Rudy Vallee, who invited her to become a regular on his radio show. From 1935 until 1938 she was a regular performer on Dick Powell's radio show. From 1946 to 1951, she performed with Don Ameche as the insufferable wife, Blanche, on the radio comedy \"The Bickersons\".\n\nLangford made her film debut in \"Every Night at Eight\" (1935), introducing what became her signature song: \"I'm in the Mood for Love\". She then began appearing frequently in films such as \"Broadway Melody of 1936\" (1935) (in which she popularized \"Broadway Rhythm\" and \"You Are My Lucky Star\"), \"Born to Dance\" (1936), \"Too Many Girls\" (1940) (in which she acted alongside her childhood schoolmate from Lakeland Dan White (actor)), and \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942) with James Cagney, in which (portraying Nora Bayes) she performed the popular song \"Over There\". She also appeared on screen in \"Dixie Jamboree\" and \"Radio Stars on Parade\".\n\nIn a Western movie, \"Deputy Marshal\", she co-starred with her first husband, matinee idol Jon Hall. In several of Langford's films, such as \"Broadway Melody\", she appeared as herself, as in 1953 in \"The Glenn Miller Story\", where she sang \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\" with the Modernaires and the movie orchestra.\n\nFrom 1941, Langford was a regular singer on Bob Hope's \"The Pepsodent Show\" when he held his first military entertainment program at March Field in Riverside, California in 1941. The show was so positive, he continued broadcasting from training bases around the country and asked Langford to join him. During World War II, she joined Hope, Jerry Colonna, guitarist Tony Romano, and other performers on USO tours through Europe, North Africa, and the South Pacific, entertaining thousands of GIs throughout the world. During a USO tour in the Pacific theater, she was invited to take a ride in a P-38 fighter plane. During the flight, a Japanese ship was spotted and the joy ride was postponed until the pilot finished strafing the ship.\n\nIn his memoir, \"Don't Shoot! It's Only Me!\", Bob Hope recalled how Frances Langford got the biggest laugh he had ever heard. At a USO show in the South Pacific, Langford stood up on a stage to sing before a huge crowd of GIs. When Langford sang the first line of her signature song, \"I'm in the Mood for Love,\" a soldier in the audience stood up and shouted, \"You've come to the right place, honey!\"\n\nAlso, during the war, Langford wrote the weekly \"Purple Heart Diary\" column for Hearst Newspapers, in which she described her visits to military hospitals to entertain wounded GIs. She used the weekly column as a means of allowing the recovering troops to voice their complaints, and to ask for public support for making sure that the wounded troops received all the supplies and comforts they needed.\n\nHer association with Hope continued into the 1980s. In 1989 she joined him for a USO tour to entertain troops in the Persian Gulf.\n\nLangford worked for several years in the late 1940s on \"The Spike Jones Show\" and starred in a short-lived DuMont variety show \"Star Time\" (1950). As a guest on early television shows such as Perry Como and Jackie Gleason she was motivated to venture into television. She was the host of two self-titled variety television programs. She then teamed with Don Ameche for the ABC television program, \"The Frances Langford/Don Ameche Show\" (1951), a spin-off of their successful radio series \"The Bickersons\" in which the duo played a feuding married couple. Langford was also the host of the NBC musical variety program \"Frances Langford Presents\" (1959), which lasted one season, as did a later program \"The Frances Langford Show\" (1960). Another notable appearance was in \"The Honeymooners\" lost episode \"Christmas Party\" which first aired December 19, 1953.\n\nLangford married three times. Her first husband (1934–55) was actor Jon Hall. In 1948, they donated of land near her estate in Jensen Beach, Florida, to the Martin County Board of County Commissioners, which named it \"Langford Hall Park\". Located at 2369 N.E. Dixie Highway, just south of the Stuart Welcome Arch, it is known today simply as \"Langford Park\" and is one of the county's major parks.\n\nIn 1946, Langford was honored by the hometown of her youth, Lakeland, Florida, for her work with the United Service Organizations (USO) and her music and acting career. The City of Lakeland dedicated the Lake Mirror Promenade as the Frances Langford Promenade. The Promenade was originally built in 1928 and was designed by renowned landscape architect Charles W. Leavitt of New York.\n\nAfter leaving Hollywood life, she kept up her pastimes of boating and sport fishing. As a nightclub singer in 1955, she married Outboard Marine Corporation president Ralph Evinrude. They lived on her estate in Jensen Beach (which has been demolished, and a housing development has replaced it), and they built a Polynesian-themed restaurant and marina on the Indian River they named \"The Frances Langford Outrigger Resort\", where Langford frequently performed. Locals and celebrities flocked to the restaurant. It remains open under the name of the Dolphin Bar and Shrimp House, and many of Frances Langford's memorabilia are still on display. Evinrude died in 1986. In 1994, Langford married Harold C. Stuart, who had served as Assistant Secretary for Civil Affairs of the United States Air Force (1949–51) under President Harry S. Truman. They spent the summers at Baie Fine in Georgian Bay, Ontario, Canada, traveling from their home in Florida aboard their 110-foot yacht \"The Chanticleer\", which became a popular tourist attraction when moored at the Outrigger Resort. Stuart survived Langford (who had no children) and died in 2007 at the age of 94.\n\nHealth problems plagued her in the last years of her life, requiring periodic hospital stays. She died at her Jensen Beach home at age 92 from congestive heart failure. According to her wishes, she was cremated and the ashes strewn off the coast of Florida near her residence.\n\nLangford has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one at 1500 Vine Street, which acknowledges her contribution to motion pictures and one at 1525 Vine Street for her work in radio. Both were dedicated February 8, 1960.\n\nLangford was a supportive member of the Jensen Beach, Florida, community and constantly donated money to it. She was a great philanthropist and her generosity to the Florida Oceanographic Society located on Hutchinson Island in Stuart was well known. The site provides education and research of the ocean, reefs and environment in the Florida area. The visitor's center bears her name and also houses some of her artifacts. Her collection of mounted tuna, marlin and other fish adorn the walls.\n\nIn 2006, the Frances Langford Heart Center, made possible by a bequest from her estate, opened at Martin Memorial Hospital in Stuart, Florida.\n\n\nFrances Langford is featured on the DVD \"Entertaining the Troops\" with Bob Hope.\n\n"}

The car was introduced in June 2005, as an indirect successor to Proton Tiara. It was discontinued in 2011 due to slow sales compared to the Perodua Myvi.\n\nFollowing Proton's decision to discontinue the Citroën AX based Tiara in 2000, a replacement model was required in order for Proton to reenter the supermini market. The replacement, originally codenamed the Tiara Replacement Model (TRM), was partially designed in house by Proton, but is powered by a Renault D-Type engine.\n\nThe Savvy was launched June 2005 in Malaysia as a manual transmission only model, followed by the introduction of Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) model in November 2005. Export models of the Savvy were introduced to the United Kingdom in September 2005. \n\nThe Savvy was also among two models (alongside the Proton Gen-2) the now defunct MG Rover was seeking to rebadge when it entered talks with Proton's parent company during 2004. \n\nIn March 2006, Proton introduced a \"Savvy Zerokit\" variant developed in conjunction with the Proton's motorsports division, R3 (Race Rally Research), that included an all round bodykit and rear spoiler made from fibre-reinforced plastic, and JRD 155 wheels. Additional options included \"dark titanium\" headlights, performance suspension and a performance rear exhaust muffler that increased the power output up by to .\n\nOn 3 January 2007, Proton launched the Savvy facelift in left-hand drive in Taiwan. It featured an infotainment system with an integrated LCD, DVD video and audio playing capabilities. \n\nTwo weeks later on 19 January, Proton launched the Savvy facelift in Malaysia. It added two more colors — Energy Orange and Genetic Silver. The front and rear of the pre-facelift models look similar in that both have a \"V\" design for the logo, whereas the facelift models feature a straight horizontal grille in the front and two horizontal lines in the rear. \n\nIn July 2007, Proton announced a basic variant called Savvy Lite, of which this model has more manually controlled mechanical parts and without \"expensive\" features such as remote control, power windows and alarm system. \n\nThe second generation Proton Saga, launched in January 2008, based its chassis on that of the Savvy, albeit elongated to support sedan bodywork. \n\nThe Savvy is also notable for being the first Proton car to undergo a publicly announced recall. On April 1, 2008, Proton Edar ordered the recall of all 34,000 Savvys on Malaysian roads (of which their production dates were before December 17, 2007) for an inspection and replacement of the rear wheel bearings, based on a parts defect found during random checks.. The announcement was a precautionary measure over potential water ingress into the Savvy's rear wheel bearing set, causing malfunction of its components. \n\nIn 2011 production of the Savvy was stopped and the car was discontinued due to very slow sales compared to the Perodua Myvi.\nUnlike the Tiara, the Savvy's exterior design was largely developed in-house by Proton, prominently featuring a clamshell bonnet design for efficient air ventilation. The Savvy is powered by a 1.2 litre D-Type DOHC 16 valve engine sourced from Renault, similar to the one used in the Renault Twingo and Clio.\n\nThe reverse gear for the manual transmission model is placed at the top left which is the position of a normal first gear position for conventional manual transmission cars. A locking mechanism is equipped to prevent the driver from accidentally shifting to reverse when shifting to the first gear, which can be unlocked by pulling up the black ring at the gear knob while shifting to reverse. This is a similar mechanism in many European cars, including Volvo and Renault cars from the mid 1990s.\n\nThe Savvy, along with other in house designed Protons such as the Gen-2, Persona, Satria Neo, Waja, Waja Chancellor, and second generation Saga, feature turn indicator switches placed at the left hand side, unlike models introduced earlier, such as the first generation Saga, Wira and Perdana.\n\nThe Savvy was exported to Australia, United Kingdom, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia.\n\nThe facelifted Savvy was available in two variants in Indonesia: MT and AMT. There was a choice of seven colors: Onyx Black, Metal Grey, Genetic Silver, Energy Orange, Solid Red, Passion Blue and Solid White. It came with a 3 year or 100,000 km warranty.\n\nThe Savvy has received two known \"Car of the Year\" awards from two ASEAN countries, including the \"Cars, Bikes & Trucks\"'s \"\"New Straits Times\"/AmBank Group 2006 Car of the Year\" Award in the Supermini category, and the \"Best City Car\" award at the 6th Indonesian Car of the Year 2007 awards. The car is also the only Proton model so far to be TÜV (Technischer Überwachungsverein) Certified.\n\nThe Savvy was voted among Thailand's Top 10 Cars in 2008, by \"The Nation Daily\".\n\nThe Savvy is also recognised in the Malaysian Book of Records as the most fuel efficient car in Malaysia, during an on road test by Proton, with an average fuel consumption of about 24 km/l.\n"}

Nonetheless, the coalition's demonstration in Auchterarder on the day the G8 summit began was perhaps their most significant action.\n\nThe coalition had considerable difficulty getting permission for the march and just days before the G8 it looked likely that permission would be denied, despite a prior agreement by the Scottish Executive that the right to protest at Gleneagles would be upheld. In response to this, Scottish Socialist Party MSPs made a silent protest in the chamber at Holyrood. They were debarred from the parliament for a month for refusing to leave the chamber when instructed to do so by the Speaker. Permission was eventually granted only days before the protest was to take place. \n\nOn the day itself, police did call the march off for a time, and there was a level of confusion among the public about whether or not the march would be going ahead, however they eventually relented when the organisers said they would go ahead anyway and when a number of protesters started to head toward Edinburgh as an alternative protest site. Despite this a number of coaches were turned back or temporarily detained. \n\nThe march attracted considerable media attention when a number of participants broke away from the main demonstration across a field where they proceeded to bring down a section of the fence surrounding the hotel where the summit was being held. The police responded by bringing in additional riot police using Chinook helicopters and were soon able to clear the field.\n\n\n\n"}

Métis settlers began making homes here in the 1860s and 1870s, many of them fleeing economic and social dislocation from Red River, Manitoba. The settlements became the centre of Métis resistance during the North-West Rebellion when in March 1885, Louis Riel, Gabriel Dumont, Honoré Jackson, and others set up the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan with their headquarters at Batoche.\n\nThe Settlements stretched along both sides of the South Saskatchewan River in river lot style from Fish Creek north through Batoche and St. Laurent to St. Louis which was its northern boundary. They included Duck Lake 12 kilometers from St. Laurent accessed by the St. Laurent Ferry. The distance from Fish Creek to St. Louis was less than 50 kilometres. They were proximal to several Cree reserves, as well as Anglo-Metis settlements to the north around Prince Albert.\n\nBatoche and St. Laurent de Grandin were founded by French Métis hivernants from the Red River settlement. \"Hivernants\" were hunters and trappers who spent the winter on the prairies and returned to the Red River settlement in the spring with their winter catch.\n\nGabriel Dumont was the leader of the buffalo hunt for his group of 200 hunters living in the Southbranch settlements from 1863 to the end of the Métis buffalo hunts in about 1875.\nIn 1873 the Southbranch settlements organized a form of local government, under Gabriel Dumont, based on the laws of the buffalo hunt.\n\nIn the 1880s the population of the Southbranch settlements may have been as high as 1300 with 40 to 60 families living in each of the four largest communities.\n\nThe North-West Rebellion of 1885 was a traumatic event for all the Southbranch communities, and they had passed their prime by the 1890s when the railway brought in increasing numbers of new immigrant settlers. Some of the settlements, such as St. Louis still remain however.\n\nMissionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate established missions in the settlements during the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nBy 1888 all the Missions except Fish Creek had schools. St. Laurent had a post office, a telegraph office and a store. Duck Lake had a post office (called Stobart) a flour mill and a trading post. Batoche had three stores, a post office and a saloon.

It is a prominent landmark in the city of Chester and is said to be the most photographed clock in England after Big Ben.\n\nThe original gate was guarded by a timber tower which was replaced by a stone tower in the 2nd century, and this in turn was replaced probably in the 14th century. The present gateway dates from 1768 and is a three-arched sandstone structure which carries the walkway forming part of Chester city walls. In 1899 a clock was added to the top of the gateway to celebrate the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria two years earlier. It is carried on openwork iron pylons, has a clock face on all four sides, and a copper ogee cupola. The clock was designed by the Chester architect John Douglas. The whole structure, gateway and clock, was designated as a Grade I listed building on 28 July 1955.\n\nChester was first established as a Roman fortress and town, known as \"Deva Victrix\" in about AD 74 or 75. The fortress was in the shape of a rectangle with rounded corners. This was protected by a turf and earth rampart on which was a timber palisade, and outside this was a V-shaped ditch. On each of the sides was a gate; the gate on the east side has survived as the Eastgate. It was defended by a timber tower. The road running through the gate led to Manchester, then across the Pennines to York. It is thought that outside the fortress, this road was lined by timber buildings which were used as shops or for other kinds of commercial activities. Just outside the gate, to the north, was a large open area used as a parade ground. From about AD 100 the defences of the fortress were reinforced by a sandstone wall and at this time the gates and their towers were rebuilt in stone.\n\nIn 907 the Saxon kings of Wessex refounded Chester as a burh. It is likely that at this time the Roman Eastgate was still present. By the medieval period the Eastgate was the most important entrance to the city. The Roman Eastgate had been replaced but the date of the replacement is not known. Its design was possibly influenced by Caernarvon Castle, which makes the early 14th century its most likely date for its construction. It consisted of a tall rectangular tower with octagonal corner turrets. At its flanks were lower towers which also had octagonal turrets. During an excavation in 1971 a portion of the northern flanking turret was found, consisting of cream-coloured sandstone (in contrast to the red sandstone normally used in Chester).\n\nOutside the Eastgate, excavations in 1991 revealed the presence of three ditches. The ditch made during the Saxon period was wide but shallow, being only a little over in depth. It had been filled with rubble and masonry. The next ditch was deeper, deep, and this may have been constructed when the new Eastgate was built, probably in the 14th century. The third ditch was built during the later medieval period, probably to assist with drainage. The two later ditches were later used for the disposal of rubbish and became waterlogged, so that they contained organic materials which do not normally survive well in Chester.\n\nBy the 18th century the city walls were no longer needed for defensive purposes and so, rather than being pulled down, they were converted into walkways. The medieval gateways were obstructing the traffic into the city and were replaced by wider arched gateways with balustraded parapets. The first gateway to be replaced was Eastgate in 1768 which was rebuilt as an \"elegant arch\". It was built at the expense of Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor, and designed by Mr Hayden (or Heyden), the earl's surveyor of buildings.\n\nEastgate is built in red sandstone and consists of a wide central arch, with rusticated jambs and voussoirs, and a small pedestrian arch on each side. On the inner keystone are the arms of the county palatine, a sword of justice and three sheaves. On this side of the gateway is a frieze-band with an inscription reading \"THIS GATE BEGUN MDCCLXVIII JOHN KELSAL ESQ. MAYOR: FINISHED MDCCLXIX CHA. BOSWELL ESQ. MAYOR\". The outer keystone has the arms of Richard Grosvenor with the motto \"NOBILITATE VIRTUS NON STEMMA CHARACTER\". The frieze-band inscription reads \"ERECTED AT THE EXPENSE OF RICHARD LORD GROSVENOR A.D. MDLXIX\". The walkway which forms part of the circuit of the city walls crosses the top of Eastgate which is surmounted by the Victorian clock.\n\nThe first scheme to enhance Eastgate came following the visit of the Prince of Wales to the city in 1869. In 1872 the local architect John Douglas was asked to prepare a number of designs by Hugh Grosvenor who was at that time the 3rd Marquess of Westminster. The Marquess offered to pay half the cost of the project but the Chester Improvement Committee would not allow any council funds for it, and the scheme came to nothing. The idea was revived to celebrate the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1896. At this time the 1st Duke of Westminster suggested that the city should support Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute of Nurses. Other ideas suggested at the time were a statue of Queen Victoria in the Town Hall square, or a clock in the Town Hall tower.\n\nA committee was set up and, despite early support for the Queen's Institute and for general festivities, it was finally decided to erect a memorial tower and clock on Eastgate. John Douglas was again invited to prepare a design. His first design was for a stone structure costing £1,000 (). However a wooden model showed that this would restrict the daylight to the neighbouring properties. In October 1897 a meeting of the subscribers to the fund (who had by that time raised nearly £651 (), carried a motion to erect a light iron-work structure containing a clock. John Douglas prepared a new design which was approved in March 1898.\n\nThe clock's faces and mechanism were paid for by Edward Evans-Lloyd, a local solicitor and freeman of the city, while the cost of the tower was financed by public subscription, and the city corporation were to pay for its subsequent maintenance. The clock mechanism was made in 1897 by J. B. Joyce & Company of Whitchurch, Shropshire, who until 1974 supplied a technician to travel to Chester each week to wind it. The cast iron inscriptions on the clock were made by the Coalbrookdale Iron Company. The ironwork for the tower was made by the firm of James Swindley of Handbridge; James Swindley was John Douglas's cousin. The official opening of the clock was performed on 27 May 1899, which was Queen Victoria's 80th birthday.\n\nAfter souvenir hunters stole the hands of the clock, the city council glazed the clock faces in 1988. In 1992 an electric mechanism replaced the original wind-up mechanism. In 1996 the clock faces were restored with their original colours. It is said to be the most photographed clock in England after Big Ben.\n\nThe clock has a face on each of its four sides, and is supported on an open-work wrought iron pavilion on pylons with a round arch on each side. Its plinth is inscribed on each face. The inscription on the east side reads \"THIS CLOCK TOWER WAS ERECTED IN COMMEMORATION OF THE 60TH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF VICTORIA, QUEEN AND EMPRESS\", on the west side \"ANTIQUI COLANT ANTIQUUM DIERUM: B.C. ROBERTS, MAYOR 1897; J.C. HOLMES, MAYOR 1898\", on the south side \"THIS CLOCK WAS ERECTED BY EDWARD EVANS-LLOYD CITIZEN AND FREEMAN 1897\", and on the north side \"ERECTED BY PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION & COMPLETED A.D. 1899 H. STOLTEFORTH MAYOR\". Beneath each clock face in gilt is the date 1897, and above each face, again in gilt, the initials \"VR\". Over the clock is a copper ogee cupola which is surmounted by a weather vane with lions rampant or on gules background.\n\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\n"}

He married Alexandrina Fredricka Dupre in 1889.\n\nHe exhibited regularly by the late 1880s. He and his wife traveled to England, settling in 1889 in the English artists' colony of St. Ives, Cornwall from 1889 to 1898. over the next decade he exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists and was included in the Paris Salon in 1890, 1894, and 1895, winning an award in 1894.\n\nLaurence abandoned his family and came to Alaska in 1903 or 1904.\n\nLaurence was the first professionally trained artist to make Alaska his home. He moved to Alaska in 1904 for reasons still unknown. Records from 1907 show he lived in the village of Tyonek on the North Shore of Cook Inlet in Southcentral Alaska, about 60 miles from Ship Creek where Anchorage would begin years later. Living the hard life of the pioneer prospector, he painted little in his first years in the then-District of Alaska, but between 1911 and 1914 he began to focus once again on his art. He moved from Valdez to the nascent town of Anchorage in 1915 and by 1920 was Alaska's most prominent painter.\n\nLaurence painted a variety of Alaskan scenes in his long and prolific career, among them sailing ships and steamships in Alaskan waters, totem poles in Southeast Alaska, dramatic headlands and the quiet coves and streams of Cook Inlet, cabins and caches under the northern lights, and Alaska Natives, miners, and trappers engaged in their often solitary lives in the northern wilderness.\nBut the image of Denali from the hills above the rapids of the Tokositna River became his trademark. It is this image more than any other which personifies Laurence for his many admirers and collectors in Alaska and beyond.\n\nLaurence forged a uniquely personal style by applying the tonalist techniques he had learned in New York and Europe to the wilderness of the North. He, more than any other artist, defined for Alaskans and others the image of Alaska as \"The Last Frontier.\"\n\nIn May 1927, Laurence married Jeanne Kunath, a French-born artist who had emigrated to the United States in 1920. He died in Anchorage on December 10, 1940.\n\nSeveral places were named for Laurence in his adopted hometown. Laurence Court is a short street in the Bootleggers Cove neighborhood of Anchorage. Perhaps the most significant was the Sydney Laurence Auditorium, which sat downtown at the northwest corner of West Sixth Avenue and F Street. This structure was replaced during the 1980s by the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts in what Anchorage called \"Project 80s\", a large-scale civic improvement program carried out under mayors George M. Sullivan and Tony Knowles; now the Sydney Laurence theater is smallest of three stages at the Performing Arts Center.\n"}

The \"Sunday\" clubs were in general Catholic and working class clubs, whose players had to work on Saturday and therefore could only play on Sunday.

Reid is perhaps best known for her hit songs during the late 1980s and early 1990s such as \"Girlfriend\" (1987), \"Mercedes Boy\" (1988) and \"Giving You the Benefit\" (1990). In addition to a recording career, Reid created the contemporary R&B group TLC. Reid is currently an Atlanta-based minister, known as \"Sister Perri\".\n\nReid was born Perri Arlette McKissack on August 29, 1964, one of four siblings to two mixed African-American parents. Reid's parents divorced when she was around six years old. Her mother raised Reid and her siblings on the income of a waitress and housekeeper. Reid got her start at age sixteen in 1981 as a backing vocalist for the percussionist/band leader Bill Summers and the funk band Con Funk Shun. Reid co-wrote one of Con Funk Shun's singles, \"Body Lovers\". At age nineteen, a local musician gave Reid a production deal which fell through several months later when she became pregnant with her daughter. While working at an Oakland, California, real estate office she met contractor George L. Smith. Smith bankrolled Pebbles with $80,000 for a demo tape and video for \"Mercedes Boy\". The demo and video led to a contract with MCA. She recorded several hit singles on her own during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"Girlfriend\", \"Mercedes Boy\", \"Giving You the Benefit\", and \"Love Makes Things Happen\". Reid's cousin is R&B singer Cherrelle who was featured, along with Johnny Gill, on her 1991 hit song, \"Always\".\n\nIn July 1989, Pebbles formed the Atlanta-based production company Pebbitone and founded her own record label, Savvy Records. Pebbitone managed TLC, which was signed with LaFace Records, L.A. Reid's record label. When TLC filed for bankruptcy in 1995, due to Pebbles' alleged mismanagement regarding their funds, the ensuing conflict damaged Pebbles' marriage. She divorced Reid, and Pebbitone sued LaFace for $10 million.\n\nIn 1997, Pebbles underwent a religious conversion. Under her new stage name \"Sister Perri\", she founded Women of God Changing Lives (WOGCL) Ministries. As an ordained minister, she now preaches and ministers through song. In 2008, after a thirteen-year music hiatus, Reid released her fourth album and debut gospel album, \"Prophetic Flows Vol I & II\", which peaked at #12 on the \"Billboard\" Gospel Album Chart.

His most recognized roles include Enoch Emery in John Huston's \"Wise Blood\", Ram in \"Tron\" (1982) and Billy the Kid in \"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\" (1989).\n\nShor was born and raised in New York City. He attended McBurney School from the 6th through the 8th grade. His mother, who was an actress, died when he was 14. He graduated from Elisabeth Irwin High School (June 1974) and began at Northwestern University that fall. He returned to New York, where he landed the lead role of Alan Strang in the first national company of \"Equus\".\n\nShor's studies continued at the Davis Center for Performing Arts at the City College of New York and at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in England.\n\nWhile in London, Shor appeared alongside Nigel Planer in Ann Jellicoe's punk rock musical play \"The Sport Of My Mad Mad Mother\" at The Roundabout Theater. After leaving London for Los Angeles (due to his casting in the title role in the ABC mini-series \"Studs Lonigan\"), Shor produced (and reprised his role in) his own version of Jellicoe's play, changing the setting from London to New York. Three months later, the set from the production was used in Billy Idol's classic music video for the song \"Dancing With Myself\".\n\nShor's acting credits include \"Air Force One\", \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\", \"Tron\", \"Red Rock West\", and John Huston's \"Wise Blood\". Television films and mini-series include \"Friendly Fire\", \"Elvis and the Colonel\" and \"The Blue and the Gray\" (for which Shor won a People's Choice Award). He was a series regular on \"Cagney and Lacey\" and several other television series as well as numerous guest star appearances including a Ferengi doctor on \"\", a role he would reprise seven years later on \"\". In 1983, Shor starred in the band Kansas' music video \"Fight Fire with Fire\" and made appearances in their \"Everybody's My Friend\" video. Stage appearances in Los Angeles and San Diego have garnered Shor eight Drama-Logue and LA Weekly performance awards.\n\nShor recently returned to the continental United States after having lived and worked in the Northern Mariana Islands of the Western Pacific since 2003. In addition to running his production company, \"ShodaVision,\" he remains active in New York theater and was recently involved (as an actor) with the experimental conversational play \"Outpost\".\n\nHe has continued with stage work at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and at the Pittsburgh Public Theater.\n\nIn 1995, Shor directed for the LA Diversified Theater Company, a multi-cultural theater alliance.

{"id": "2206304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206304", "title": "Starka", "text": "Starka\n\nStarka is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented rye mash. Traditionally Starka is made from natural (up to 2 distillations, no rectification) rye spirit and aged in oak barrels with small additions of linden-tree and apple-tree leaves. The methods of production are similar to those used in making whisky. Sold in various grades, the most notable difference between them is the length of the aging period, varying from 3 to over 50 years, and the natural colour which is obtained from the reaction between the alcohol and the oak barrel, not from the additives.\n\nStarka was known in Poland and Lithuania at least since the 15th century, later in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and by the 17th century became one of the favourite drinks of the nobility of the Commonwealth and Sarmatist culture. Tradition had it that at a child's birth, the father of the house poured large amounts of home-made spirits (approximately 75 proof) into an empty oak barrel, previously used to store wine (usually imported from Hungary at that time and hence called \"Węgrzyn\", or \"Hungarian\"). The barrel was then sealed with beeswax and buried, only to be dug out at the child's wedding. The name itself stems from this process of aging and in 15th century Polish meant both the vodka type and an old woman. Alternatively the name is derived from the Lithuanian word \"Starkus\", as production of Starka is associated with birth.\n\nIn late 19th century various companies (mostly in Imperial Russia and Austria-Hungary) slightly simplified the production process and adopted it to the needs of mass production by the Lwów-based Baczewski company. After the end of World War I, which put an end to foreign rule over former parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, starka remained one of the most popular spirits in both countries. After World War II when Lithuania was inside the Soviet Union, starka production there was not stopped and was produced in \"Vilniaus degtinė\" and \"Stumbras\" (Kaunas) factories. In Poland, all of the spirit producers were nationalized, but the production of starka continued, mostly as a high-priced export good.\n\nCurrently, Szczecińska Fabryka Wódek \"Starka\" (former \"Polmos Szczecin\") is the only company to produce Starka in Poland, and they offer it in all age classes, from 3 to 35 years old but the oldest Starkas date back to 1947. All Starkas produced by Szczecińska Fabryka Wódek \"Starka\" contain 40% alcohol by volume. There is also a number of other companies (most notably in Lithuania, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Russia, Latvia and United States) that produce vodkas styled after the starka (produced mostly from a mixture of rectified spirit and herbal tinctures).\n"}

The term was first coined by Arrow Dynamics and Cedar Point in 1989 with the release of the first full-circuit hypercoaster in the world, Magnum XL-200. Other roller coaster manufacturers developed their own models with custom names, including \"Mega Coasters\" from Intamin, \"Hyper Coasters\" from Bolliger & Mabillard, and \"Hyper-Hybrid Coasters\" from Rocky Mountain Construction. The competition between amusement parks to build increasingly taller roller coasters eventually led to \"giga coasters\" which exceed and \"strata coasters\" which exceed .\n\nThe world's first hypercoaster was Magnum XL-200 by Cedar Point, costing $8,000,000 USD. Cedar Point chose Arrow Dynamics to design and construct Magnum XL-200. Construction on Magnum XL-200 began in 1988, and the ride opened on May 6, 1989. Since its debut, Magnum XL-200 has served more than 36 million guests. Cedar Point's official blog states that after building the ride, \"discussion was focused on just what a roller coaster such as Magnum should be called. After all, it had no loops like most of the other large steel coasters of the time and was so much bigger and faster than its non-looping brethren. After a couple of years, the name everyone agreed upon was hypercoaster.\"\n\nHypercoasters were originally built for speed and airtime, to counter the trend of constructing bigger and bigger looping coasters. To accomplish this the elements of a hypercoaster often include a large first drop, several additional drops of declining height, a large turn or helix and then many airtime-inducing hills. Hypercoasters are commonly designed with an out and back layout, although there are occasionally hypercoasters that use a twisted layout, such as Raging Bull at Six Flags Great America, and others that combine both, such as Diamondback at Kings Island.\n\nHypercoasters dominate the \"Amusement Today\" Golden Ticket Awards. For 2006, , now known as Superman the Ride (formerly Bizarro), located at Six Flags New England was ranked highest at #1. Several hypercoasters followed such as Magnum XL-200 (#3), Nitro (#4), Apollo's Chariot (#5). The hypercoasters make up the majority of the 2006 Top 10 Steel Coasters, filling 8/10 positions. By 2010, hypercoasters held all of the top 10 spots on Amusement Today's list of \"Top 50 Steel Roller Coasters\" and 16 of the top 20.\n\nHypercoasters were first manufactured by Arrow Dynamics in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Since then, a number of companies, including Bolliger & Mabillard, Intamin, D. H. Morgan Manufacturing, Giovanola and others have designed and constructed hypercoasters.\n\nThough hypercoasters are typically steel roller coasters, \"Son of Beast\" at Kings Island was the first and only wooden hypercoaster. Due to a number of issues, the ride was eventually demolished in 2012.\nIn 2018, Cedar Point opened the first hybrid hypercoaster, \" Steel Vengeance\".

The Sharper Image catalog and website are owned and operated by Michigan-based Camelot Venture Group, while the brand licensing is owned by ThreeSixty Group, Inc.\n\nThe brand has been in operation since its relaunch in 2010. The earlier consumer products retailer by that name was founded by Richard Thalheimer and was in business from 1977 until its closing in 2008. The company sold merchandise through dozens of retail stores throughout the United States, a monthly catalog, and its website, along with business-to-business sales teams that marketed products for corporate incentive programs and wholesale to retailers.\n\nThe Sharper Image was the brainchild of Richard Thalheimer. The company started in 1977 as a catalog business to sell jogging watches. Later, through what had become an iconic catalog, The Sharper Image expanded its product assortment to include high end, futuristic gadgets, electronics, massage chairs, and air purifiers. Popular products such as the Ionic Breeze and exclusive models of Human Touch massage chairs helped propel The Sharper Image to become an iconic American brand with 187 retail stores in 38 states.\n\nIn 2006 there was a change in the board of directors of the company, including the removal of Thalheimer as CEO. Thalheimer was replaced by Chairman Jerry W. Levin. Not long after, on April 9, 2007, Steven A. Lightman became the president and CEO.\n\nOn April 10, 2008, Levin resigned as a member and Chairman of the Board of the company to pursue participating with other investors to acquire some or all of the company’s businesses or assets. But, as was pointed out, \"Levin hasn't made a lot of money for the investors of Sharper Image he's teamed up with so far, including hedge fund Ramius Capital, which helped bring him in as a director, and Clinton Group, which announced a large stake in December.\" Under Levin, the company's stock price had fallen from about $40 three years ago to about 23 cents (a \"paltry\" $3.6 million market capitalization) at the time of his departure, on the over-the-counter pink sheets. His group's bid did not succeed.\n\nThe Sharper Image stock price reached a record low of 29 cents a share on February 20, 2008. On February 25, 2008, The Sharper Image announced it had received notification that it would be delisted from the NASDAQ exchange. The company filed for bankruptcy protection with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware. Sharper Image said it had $251.5 million of assets and $199 million of debts as of January 31, 2008, according to the filing. Cash on hand totaled about $700,000. All of its retail stores were closed by the end of 2008.\n\nOn May 29, 2008, a joint venture led by units of private investment firms Hilco Consumer Capital, Infinity Lifestyle Brands, Gordon Brothers Group and Bluestar Alliance won a bankruptcy auction to acquire the assets of The Sharper Image, paying $49 million plus some contingent recovery for the company's assets. The Sharper Image name was licensed and used to sell products through third-party retailers, including Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, OfficeMax, Big 5 Sporting Goods, or through the branded website. New products were created through partnerships with other businesses.\n\nIn August 2009, Camelot Venture Group secured the rights to operate a new Sharper Image catalog and website, SharperImage.com, and appointed David Katzman as CEO. In 2011, Iconix Brand Group bought the Sharper Image brand and controlled all licensing agreements, while Camelot Venture Group continued to operate the catalog and website. In June 2014, Camelot Venture Group acquired the rights to the consumer-facing division of the brand (catalog and e-commerce) from Iconix Brand Group. In December 2016, Irvine California-based ThreeSixty Group, owners of the FAO Schwarz brand, purchased The Sharper Image brand licensing rights from Iconix Brand Group for US$100 million. Camelot Venture Group continues to grow the Sharper Image brand through the website, increased catalog circulation, digital marketing, consumer promotions, and heightened presence on social media. In April 2018, Camelot Venture Group appointed Lance Reese as CEO.\n\nThe Sharper Image's advertising budget was primarily directed to its monthly catalog for about the first 20 years of its existence. Once products like the Ionic Breeze were introduced, the company began using infomercials for advertising. Most other products in the home air purifier market (including those made by Oreck) already used this medium, so The Sharper Image followed. This move boosted sales, but led to confusion between prices advertised on television and those marked in the retail stores. The company was known to receive special supplier contracts. For instance, its HW551 and HW552 product code massage chairs were specific to The Sharper Image, and Human Touch Interactive didn't sell those specific chairs to any other retailer. \n\nToday, The Sharper Image features products and promotions through multiple digital and traditional marketing mediums, including TV commercials, email, search engine marketing, display ads, its blog, and its social media outlets - Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest. In addition, it maintains the tradition of high-profile catalog covers, recently featuring stars such as Josh Duhamel, Heidi Klum, Betty White and Megan Fox.\n\nThe Sharper Image's website showcases unique products, carrying both The Sharper Image name and other brand names such as Bose and Human Touch. While various products are featured in gift guides across the internet, The Sharper Image website also features its own Gift Guides for occasions such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, and the major holiday season.\n\nProducts from the website have been featured in tech blogs, and popular TV segments such as \"The Today Show\".\n\nSharper Image licensed products can be found in major retail stores such as Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Nordstrom, and Macy's.\n\nIn 2002, \"Consumer Reports\" tested many fan-driven air purifiers alongside the Sharper Image's Ionic Breeze Quadra. The Sharper Image was not happy with the results, and sued \"Consumer Reports\" in order to get what they thought would be a more fair testing of the product. However, the suit was dismissed, primarily due to the court finding that the company \"has not shown that the test protocol used by Consumers Union was scientifically, or otherwise, invalid,\" and had not \"demonstrated a reasonable probability that any of the challenged statements were false.\" Furthermore, Sharper Image could not \"come forward with any evidence from which a finding of malice could be made.\"\n\nTwo years later, \"Consumer Reports\" stated that the Quadra could be dangerous to consumers' health, because of the trace levels of ozone produced by the unit. As a result, sales plummeted, and Sharper Image stores took back all units for a cash refund. The Sharper Image's response was to work with the Engelhard Corporation and create an ozone catalyst that reduced the amount of excess ozone in the purified air before it circulated throughout the room.\n\n"}
{"id": "2206335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206335", "title": "Opisthorchis viverrini", "text": "Opisthorchis viverrini\n\nOpisthorchis viverrini, common name Southeast Asian liver fluke, is a food-borne trematode parasite from the family Opisthorchiidae that infects the bile duct. People are infected after eating raw or undercooked fish. Infection with the parasite is called opisthorchiasis. \"O. viverrini\" infection also increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the bile ducts.\n\nA small, leaf-like fluke, \"O. viverrini\" completes its lifecycle in three different animals. Snails of the species \"Bithynia\" are the first intermediate hosts, fish belonging to the family Cyprinidae are the second intermediate host, and the definitive hosts are humans and other mammals such as dogs, cats, rats, and pigs. It was first discovered in the Indian fishing cat (\"Prionailurus viverrus\") by M.J. Poirier in 1886. The first human case was discovered by Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915.\n\n\"O. viverrini\" (together with \"Clonorchis sinensis\" and \"Opisthorchis felineus\") is one of the three most medically important species in the family Opisthorchiidae. In fact \"O. viverrini\" and \"C. sinensis\" are capable of causing cancer in humans, and are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 biological carcinogen in 2009. \"O. viverrini\" is found in Thailand, the Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. It is most widely distributed in northern Thailand, with high prevalence in humans, while central Thailand has a low rate of prevalence.\n\n\"O. viverrini\" was first described by a French parasitologist Jules Poirier in 1886, who discovered the parasite in an Indian fishing cat (\"Prionailurus viverrus\"), originally from Southeast Asia, that died in the Zoological Gardens attached to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. He named it \"Distomum viverrini\". American parasitologists Charles Wardell Stiles and Albert Hassall redescribed it and assigned it to the existing genus \"Opisthorchis\" (created by a French zoologist Raphaël Blanchard) in 1891. The first human specimen was described by a British parasitologist Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915, but without knowing the exact parasite. (He simply reported it as \"Notes of the occurrence of parasites presumably rare in man.\") Leiper received the specimens from an Irish medical doctor, Arthur Francis George Kerr, who had collected them from the \"post mortem\" examination of two prisoners at a jail in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. In the next year, Kerr himself reported from investigation of 230 male prisoners that 39 (17 percent) of them had the infection. Kerr initially misidentified the parasite as \"O. felineus\", an already known human parasite, because of their close resemblance. C. Prommas also reported \"O. felineus\" in 1927 from an autopsy of a 17-year-old Thai male residing in Roi Et, northeast Thailand. It was in 1955 when Elvio H. Sadun from the U. S. Public Health Service analysed the cases of opisthorchiasis in Thailand and concluded that all the infections were due to \"O. viverrini\". A systematic comparison in 1965 confirmed the differences from \"O. felineus\".\n\nStructurally, \"O. viverrini\" is basically similar to \"C. sinensis\" and \"O. felineus\", but it is slightly smaller than the two flukes. The body of an adult \"O. viverrini\" is flat (dorsoventrally flattened) like a leaf, shaped like a lancet, and can be seen through (transparent). They are monoecious, so no male or female individuals exist; each fluke has the complete sets of both male and female reproductive systems. A typical individual is 7 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. The anterior end is more pointed and marked by a mouth-like structure called oral sucker. About 1.5 mm behind the oral sucker is a similar structure called ventral sucker. These suckers are the organs of attachment. Two testes are seen towards the posterior end. The testes are lobed in contrast to the branched (dendritic) testes of \"C.sinensis\". It is connected to the seminal vesicle, which is a coiled tube running up to the ejaculatory duct, which in turn opens through a small opening called genital pore just in front of the ventral sucker. Two ovaries are situated in front of the testes, and they form several lobes. The uterus runs along the ejaculatory duct and opens at the genital pore. A sac-like S-shaped tube called excretory bladder is between the two testes. The remaining body spaces are mostly occupied by a highly branched glandular organ called vitellaria (often called vitelline glands). Unlike the anterior end, the posterior end is rounded.\n\nThe eggs of \"O. viverrini\" are 30 × 12 μm in size and they are slightly narrower and more regularly ovoid than in \"C. sinensis\". The eggs are visually indistinguishable in Kato technique smears from other eggs of flukes from other fluke family Heterophyidae.\n\nThe infective larvae, metacercariae, of \"O. viverrini\" are brownish and elliptical, with two nearly equal-sized suckers - the oral sucker and the ventral sucker. They are 0.19–0.25 × 0.15–0.22 mm in size.\n\n\"O. viverrini\" is a hermaphroditic liver fluke. Similar to \"C. sinensis\" and \"O. felineus\", it requires three different hosts to complete its lifecycle. Freshwater snails are the first intermediate hosts in which asexual reproduction takes place, and freshwater fishes belonging to the family Cyprinidae) are second intermediate hosts in which larval development occurs. Fish–eating (piscivorous) mammals, including humans, dogs, and cats, act as definitive hosts, in which sexual reproduction occurs. As a result of poor sanitation practices and inadequate sewerage infrastructure, \"O. viverrini\"-infected people pass the trematode's eggs in their feces into bodies of fresh water from where snails become infected.\n\nThe first intermediate hosts include freshwater snails of the genus \"Bithynia\". The only known host is \"Bithynia siamensis\" (that include all its three subspecies). Snails are infected by the free-swimming larvae called miracidia in water bodies where faecal matters of infected mammals are deposited. Inside the snail tissue, the miracidia grow into sposocysts, that contain spore-like daughter cells. The daughter cells called rediae multiply and develop into numerous larvae called cercariae. Each cercaria has a large head and a long tail. The cercariae escape from the snail and enter the water body again as free-swimming larvae. Their tails act as a propeller for swimming and they actively search for a fish host.\n\nThe cercaria then locates a cyprinoid fish, encysts in the fins, skin, and musculature of the fish, and becomes a metacercaria. Habitats of second intermediate hosts of \"O. viverrini\" include freshwater habitats with stagnant or slow-moving waters (ponds, river, aquaculture, swamps, rice fields).\n\nIn 1965, 9 fish hosts of \"O. viverrini\" were known. Up to 2002, 15 species of fishes from seven genera of the family Cyprinidae were known to serve as second intermediate host. Further research by Rim \"et al.\" (2008) showed an additional five host species. The known hosts include \"Puntius brevis\", \"P. gonionotus\", \"P. orphoides\", \"P. proctozysron\", \"P. viehoeveri\", \"Hampala dispar\", \"H. macrolepidota\", \"Cyclocheilichthys armatus\", \"C. repasson\", \"Labiobarbus lineatus\", \"Esomus metallicus\", \"Mystacoleucus marginatus\", \"Puntioplites falcifer\", \"Onychostoma elongatum\", \"Osteochilus hasseltii\", \"Hypsibarbus lagleri\", and \"Barbodes gonionotus\".\n\nThe metacercarial stage is infective to humans and other fish-eating mammals, including dogs, cats, rats, and pigs. Fish contain more metacercaria from September to February, before the dry season, and this is when humans are usually infected. Infection is acquired when people ingest raw or undercooked fish. Dishes of raw fish are common in the cuisine of Laos and the cuisine of Thailand: \"koi pla\", raw fish in spicy salad \"larb pla\", salted semifermented fish dishes called \"pla ra\", \"pla som\" and \"som fak\". The natural definitive host is the leopard cat (\"Prionailurus bengalensis\"). The young adult worm escapes from the metacercarial cyst in the upper small intestine and then migrates through the ampulla of Vater into the biliary tree, where it develops to sexual maturity over 4-6 weeks, thus completing the lifecycle.\n\nThe adult worms primarily live in the bile duct, gall bladder, and sometimes in the pancreatic duct. Although they are hermaphrodites, reproduction is by cross fertilization (two individuals exchanging their gametes). Fertilized eggs are laid in the bile duct and are discharged along the bile juice into the intestine, and finally released in the environment along with the faeces. An individual fluke may shed as many as 200 eggs in a day. The exact lifespan is not known, but is estimated to be more than 25 years.\n\n\"O. viverrini\" secretes a granulin-like growth protein especially in its gut and integument.\n\n\"O. viverrini\" remains a major public health problem in the Mekong Basin in Southeast Asia. It is endemic in Thailand, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Vietnam, and Cambodia. It is most prevalent in Thailand, and for this reason Thailand has the highest incident of opisthorchiasis-associated cancer, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the world. About 9.6% of the total population of Thailand is estimated to be infected. It is most abundant in northern Thailand, while it occurs moderately in central Thailand. According to the five-year national survey from 2010 to 2015, the highest incidences reached up to 45.7% of the population in northern Thailand. However, there is no record of opisthorchiasis due to \"O. viverrini\" in southern Thailand. School children are most infected, and the infection was very high before 1984, after which there was mass treatment programme, and the prevalence sharply declined after 1994. A national survey in Lao PDR (under the project of Korea-Laos Collaborative Project for Control of Foodborne Trematode Infections in Lao PDR) between 2007 and 2011 indicates that it is the most prevalent helminth infection, amounting to 55.6% of the infection. It is not highly prevalent in Vietnam, but accurate survey is difficult because it is often co-infected with other flukes such as \"Haplorchis pumilio\", \"H. taichui\", and \"C. sinensis\". It is most abundant in the northern provinces. It is least prevalent in Cambodia. A national survey between 2006 and 2011 showed that it is the second most prevalent helminth accounting for 5.7% of the total infection, after hookworm with 9.6% of the infection.\n\nGenerally, opisthorchiasis due to \"O. viverrini\" is harmless without any clinical symptoms. Mild symptoms may appear such as dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhoea. However, under severe infection, enlargement of liver (hepatomegaly) and malnutrition are observed. In rare cases, cholangitis, cholecystitis, and cholangiocarcinoma can also develop. In humans,\"O. viverrini\" inhabits mainly the bile ducts, and rarely, the gall bladder and pancreatic duct. Heavy infection can produce problems in the liver, gall bladder, and bile ducts. The bile ducts of heavily infected patients are usually dilated and indicate fibrosis. Pathological effects on the bile ducts include inflammation, epithelial desquamation, goblet-cell metaplasia, epithelial and adenomatous hyperplasia, and periductal fibrosis. The collective effects in addition to specific parasite secretion and the host's immune reactions account for the development of cholangiocarcinoma. The infection is not immediately life-threatening; cancer develops after 30–40 years, but death occurs very fast, within 3–6 months of diagnosis.\n\nMedical care and loss of wages caused by \"O. viverrini\" in Laos and in Thailand costs about million annually, primarily in northeast Thailand.\n\nInfections with \"O. viverrini\" and of other liver flukes in Asia affect the poor and poorest people. Opisthorchiasis has received less attention in comparison to other diseases, and it is a neglected disease in Asia. There is no approved drug for the infection; however, Swiss researchers have tested tribendimidine and achieved a 70% cure rate. Surgery and supportive treatment are complicated and generally unavailable in the endemic areas. A general trematocide praziquantel is used for the infection, but is not technically recommended. In addition to praziquantel other commonly used anthelmintics such as albendazole, artesunate, and miltefosine are found to be effective on the cercariae but not on the metacercariae. Its ability to cause cancer is worsened by the discovery that its infection is often associated with those of \"Helicobacter\" species (including \"H. pylori\", which is primarily associated with ulcers, but also may cause stomach cancers).\n\n\"O. viverrini\" has 12 (six pairs) of chromosomes, i.e. 2n = 12. The draft genome and transcriptomes were published in 2014. Its genome is 634.5 Mb in size. The species has 16,379 protein-coding genes.\n\n\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-2.5 text from references and CC-BY-2.0 text from the reference.\n\n"}

Tora! Tora!\".\nThe British historian Stephen Dorril, in his \"MI6 Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service\" asserts that Faragó was the 'most successful disinformer or dupe' concerning the presence of Nazis in South America. However, Faragó's book \"Aftermath: The Search for Martin Bormann\" which details the Nazi presence in South America was based on both Faragó's own personal investigation and interviews in South America, and Argentinian intelligence documents (some of which are provided in the book) whose veracity was attested to by attorney Joel Weinberg. \n\nMoreover, French intelligence operative (during World War II - on the 'Resistance' side - and later) and right-wing polemist Pierre de Villemarest justified part of Faragó's statements. Villemarest disagreed on the details of Bormann's survival, but agreed he did survive the escape from Hitler's Bunker. Villemarest states that Bormann was not a mere Soviet agent (like Heinrich Müller) but was smart enough to get free (after a few months or years) from the Soviets' 'protection'. \n\nThe main point of agreement between Faragó and Villemarest being the resolute assertion of a several-year survival of Bormann after the fall of Hitler's regime. Faragó's book 'Aftermath' contains several reproductions of genuine Argentinian secret police documents related to the life of Bormann after 1945.\n\nFaragó appeared as a contestant on the January 22, 1957 episode of \"To Tell the Truth\".

The Ravine portion of the park is located on the northwest side of Hilton Elementary School and comprises a small wooded ravine and some footpaths.\n\nThe Hilton Pier was first built in 1918 as part of the development of Hilton Village. The pier was a favorite spot for local recreational fishing for decades and has been rebuilt a number of times due to storm damage and weathering. Most recently, on September 18, 2003, the pier was destroyed by the high winds and surging tides of Hurricane Isabel. Plans to rebuild the pier started almost immediately, but were met with controversy when it was revealed that a prominent member of the state legislature wanted the new pier moved several hundred feet from its previous location because it was near his house. The pier ended up being located about 40 feet away from the location of the original pier. It was reopened in May 2005, and on July 9 was formally rededicated by Joe Frank, the mayor of Newport News.\n\nThere is a small beach at the location of the park.

{"id": "2206342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206342", "title": "Battle of Corydon", "text": "Battle of Corydon\n\nThe Battle of Corydon was a minor engagement that took place July 9, 1863, just south of Corydon, which had been the original capital of Indiana until 1825, and was the county seat of Harrison County. The attack occurred during Morgan's Raid in the American Civil War as a force of 2,500 cavalry invaded the North in support of the Tullahoma Campaign. It was the only pitched battle of the Civil War that occurred in Indiana, and no battle has occurred within Indiana since.\n\nAs news of an impending raid spread across the state, Governor Oliver P. Morton called out the state's militia force, the Indiana Legion, to defend against the threat. Unaware of the size of the invading army, four companies of the 6th and 8th Regiments of the Legion, totaling about one hundred men, attempted to prevent the Confederates from crossing the Ohio River into Indiana, but were overcome by superior artillery fire, killing two of the defenders. The units retreated northward where they met with the main body of the 6th Regiment under the command of Col. Lewis Jordan. Along with the townspeople, they constructed breastworks that formed a defensive line south of Corydon. Despite promises of reinforcements from regional Legion commanders in New Albany, only about 450 men (consisting almost entirely of locals) were defending the town.\n\nAs the raiders approached from the south, the advance elements formed a battle line and launched a frontal attack and an unsuccessful flanking movement against the east side of the Legion's works. Reinforcements and artillery soon arrived with the main body of Confederate troops, giving the attackers a strong numerical superiority. With the support of the artillery, a pincer movement caused the Legion to abandon their position to avoid being surrounded. A large part of the Legion were captured as they attempted to escape from the town, while Col. Jordon and others regrouped downtown. Confederates then seized the Legion's commissary supplies on the edge of town, and fired two warning shots into the downtown from their artillery, convincing Jordan that continued resistance was futile and leading him to surrender his force and Corydon. Although the short battle cost the cavalry twice as many casualties as the outnumbered militia units, the battle resulted in a Confederate victory, which enabled Brig. Gen. John H. Morgan to secure supplies and money before continuing his raid through Indiana and into Ohio. The delay, however, proved critical in helping the pursuing Union army overtake and later capture Morgan and his forces.\n\nFollowing the 1862 Newburgh Raid into Indiana, the federal government had put a regiment of regular cavalry troops in south central Indiana for defensive purposes. After patrolling the border for several months, no new raids materialized, and they were withdrawn in March 1863, leaving only the local militia for defense.\n\nOn June 23, 1863, Brig. Gen. John H. Morgan led a cavalry division consisting of two brigades, totaling nearly 2,500 men, and two batteries of artillery, northward from Tennessee in the Confederacy. His movements began as a ride into Kentucky to disrupt the communications of the Union Army of the Cumberland in support of Gen. Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee during the Tullahoma Campaign. Bragg had ordered Morgan to attack any settlements of his choosing in Kentucky, but not to cross the Ohio River into Union territory. Bragg was worried about Morgan getting too far from the main army and being unable to come to his aid should it be needed. Morgan was already planning to disregard the orders and had sent scouts beyond the river before leaving Tennessee. Crossing the Cumberland River at Burkesville, Kentucky, Morgan's column advanced to the Green River, where it was deflected by a Union regiment at Tebbs Bend on July 4. Morgan surprised and captured the garrison of Lebanon, and then rode northward via Springfield, Bardstown and Garnettsville.\n\nMorgan had his men tap the Union telegraph lines and send conflicting reports about his strength and destination. Most Union officials believed his target was Louisville, Kentucky. Not taking any chances, Governor of Indiana Oliver P. Morton telegraphed orders calling out all the state's militia, the Indiana Legion, south of the National Road.\n\nIn the afternoon of July 7 an advance force of Confederates entered Brandenburg, Kentucky, where they rendezvoused with Capt. Thomas Hines, who assumed command. Hines had led a reconnaissance mission into Indiana in search of Confederate sympathizers to support Morgan's coming raid. He did not find the support he was looking for, and had been pursued by elements of the 6th and 8th Regiment of the Indiana Legion who killed three of his men and captured several others before the remainder escaped back into Kentucky. Since then he had been waiting in the Brandenburg area for Morgan to arrive. The Ohio River was swollen from recent rain, making any hope of fording it impossible and requiring that the Confederates secure boats to ferry their men across. Under Hines' guidance, the Confederates set an ambush to capture the steamship \"John T. McCombs\" as it landed in Brandenburg to deliver the mail. The one ship would not be enough to allow the Confederate division to quickly cross the river, so to capture another boat the \"McCombs\" was used to simulate a distress call to lure in the fast sidewheel steamer \"Alice Dean\". As the unsuspecting ship moved alongside the \"McCombs\", the Confederates on board sprung out, lashed the two ships together, and boarded the \"Alice Dean\". Taking the two ships back to shore, they released the crew and passengers just as Morgan arrived with the main body of the army. Some of the passengers escaped the town and sent message to commanders in Louisville of the Confederate occupation of Brandenburg.\n\nIndiana militia leaders learned of Morgan's capture of Brandenburg, ten miles south of Corydon, and his intent to cross into Indiana in a dispatch from Regular Army commanders in Louisville. All the roads Morgan would likely take northward intersected at Corydon. Emergency requests for reinforcements were sent out from the town in all directions. New Albany leaders sent word promising to send a thousand men. Other companies around Harrison County immediately began to gather and advance to Corydon. Three companies of the 6th Regiment Indiana Legion based in Mauckport and totaling about one hundred men moved to Morvin's Landing, the north bank of the river opposite Brandenburg, to contest the crossing. A thirty-man company of the 8th Regiment of the Indiana Legion based in Leavenworth and under the command of Capt. G.W. Lyon, was transported to Morvin's landing by the \"Lady Pike\" during the night. They brought with them their town's ceremonial 8-pound cannon which they deployed and camouflaged on a small bluff in front of an abandoned log cabin.\n\nOn the morning of July 8, Lyon opened fire on the \"Alice Dean\", intending to destroy or disable the steamers. The men had only ever fired the cannon at celebratory events and were unsure how to aim it properly. Two shots were fired, with the second one hitting the upper deck of the \"McCombs\", passing through the ship and landing near a group of men on the shore, wounding a Confederate. Just as the shelling began Provost Marshal John Timberlake arrived on the scene from Corydon with a small company of reinforcements and assumed command. Timberlake, who was a colonel in the regular army, believed Morgan's force was small, and decided to spare the steamships and instead shell the massed cavalry. Before the cannon could be re-aimed, the superior Confederate artillery was set up and returned fire from their significantly higher position on the opposite side of the river. The dense morning fog in the valley obliged the Confederates to guess at their target. Their first shot landed short of the Legion's position, and the second shot landed behind them and leveled the cabin. The Legion defenders set off a third shot that had already been loaded into their cannon, and fled into a nearby forest. As they moved up the ridge and into the woods, they became visible to the Confederate artillery who began to shell the forest. One shot struck a log where two of the defenders had stopped to rest. They were mortally wounded while the rest fled into the forest as the Confederates continued to shell the landing.\n\nWith the resistance seemingly at an end, Morgan began crossing his troops in the captured steamers. The first company to land moved up the ridge on the north shore and engaged the Legion defenders in a skirmish. Union commanders in Louisville had sent out requests for naval support in preventing Morgan's crossing when they first received reports from Brandenburg. The tinclad \"Springfield\", armed with six 24-pound howitzers, was at New Albany and was dispatched down-river and arrived on the scene just after Morgan had begun to ferry his force across the river. The \"Springfield\" opened fire on Morgan's two steamers who retreated back under the covering fire of the Confederate artillery. The ship began shelling both the north and south shores of the river, firing at least fifty shells into Brandenburg, damaging several buildings and killing three horses. Morgan's forces took cover in nearby forests while the armed steamer and the artillery on the shore dueled for about an hour. Once the \"Springfield\" ran out of ammunition she withdrew, allowing Morgan to resume the crossing.\n\nAfter about half of his army had been ferried into Indiana, the Union gunboat and an armed private ship, the \"Grey Eagle\", arrived on the scene. The \"Elk\" fired a shot into the deck of the \"Alice Dean\" as it tried to escape to the shoreline. Both the Union ships were wooden, and as the Confederate artillery opened fire, they quickly retreated upriver towards Louisville to avoid being destroyed. The crossing resumed again. In total, it took seventeen hours for Morgan to ferry his now 2,000 men and supplies across the river. By listening in on the telegraph, he learned that Brig. Gen. Edward H. Hobson with a force of 4,000 cavalry was advancing on his position from the south. The lead elements of the Union force arrived in Brandenburg at about 8:00 pm, where the Confederate rearguard was able to delay their advance long enough for Morgan's artillery to be carried across the river. On the last trip across, most of the rearguard was able to escape, but several were left behind and captured.\n\nOnce the Confederates had crossed the river, the \"Alice Dean\" was set ablaze and sunk in the river between Morvin's landing and Mauckport to deny the Union pursuers use of the vessel and to block the landing, making their crossing more difficult. Morgan ordered the \"McCombs\" to be burnt, but Col. Duke countermanded the order because of his friendship with its captain. He was allowed to return with his ship to Louisville unharmed. Gen. Hobson and the main body of the Union cavalry arrived in Brandenburg at about 10:15 pm, just as the \"Alice Dean\" went under the water. He set up his artillery and fired several shots at the Confederates who jeered at him from the opposite side of the river; they quickly withdrew out of range of his guns. The lead elements of the cavalry had already set out northward following the Legion forces who withdrew gradually and fought delaying skirmishes along the Mauckport road to slow the cavalry's advance towards Corydon.\n\nDuring the evening, elements of Morgan's division had advanced to within five miles (8 km) of Corydon. The four Legion companies that had attempted to prevent the crossing had been reinforced by four additional companies from Corydon, one from Elizabeth, and one from New Amsterdam, making the force about four-hundred strong. They lured a company of unsuspecting Confederates into an ambush where they were surrounded; sixteen were captured and taken to the Corydon jail. The invaders also successfully captured about thirty defenders in several skirmishes. They were rounded up and held in a school house near Laconia. After Morgan crossed the river he addressed the prisoners and told them that if they would promise to go home and not return to arms, he would allow them to leave and keep their guns. They all agreed and were released.\n\nThat night Morgan's men camped at Frakes' Mill just north of Mauckport. They found the area deserted, as all the civilians had fled their homes. In the house where Morgan stayed, the table was set with supper which he and his men ate before resting for the night. Morgan's men tapped the telegraph lines again and began sending false reports that they were headed for New Albany. The disinformation dissuaded New Albany's Legion leaders from sending the large number of reinforcements to Corydon that they had been organizing. The next morning the Confederates resumed their march northward. As they passed up a county road, a shot was fired killing a soldier. The scouts opened fired on a nearby house from which they assumed the shot had come, killing a Lutheran minister and wounding his son.\n\nCorydon was the county seat of Harrison County and the former capital of Indiana. The town and immediate countryside had about one thousand inhabitants. The townspeople had been working all night building a breastwork of criss-crossed logs on a high ridge just south of the town. A pair of Confederate spies had already infiltrated Corydon and reported their findings back to Morgan. As the works were completed, the Legion fell back to the town to take up position behind them. Many older men in the town joined in the defense, swelling their numbers to about 450. Despite the emergency calls for reinforcements to the regional Legion commanders in New Albany, none of their men arrived before the battle began\n\nThe Legion's barricade was between four and five feet high (1.5 m) and stretched from the Amsterdam Road on the far western wing to the Laconia Road on the far eastern wing and straddled the Mauckport Road in the center. The 6th Regiment of the Indiana Legion was commanded by the elderly Col. Lewis Jordan, a veteran of the War of 1812. Maj. McGrain, a lieutenant in the Regular Army and recently returning from the war front, was given command of the west wing. Capt. George Lahue, a veteran of the Mexican–American War, was in command of the east wing. Although the commanders were battle hardened, most of the men behind the works had never seen battle. The western wing was heavily wooded, but the slope of the ground prevented the defenders or the attackers from seeing each other until they were within close range. The eastern wing of the works was in a mostly open field and afforded little natural cover to the attackers, while the defenders were protected from gunfire behind their works.\n\nAt 11:30 a.m. on July 9, the 3rd Regiment Kentucky Cavalry, the advance element of the Confederate forces under the command of Col. Adam R. Johnson, was sighted moving north along the Mauckport Road towards Corydon. Col. Johnson believed the artillery could have quickly dispersed the four hundred farmers-turned-soldiers, but Morgan was worried about any delay because during the night the Union forces had begun crossing the river in his rear. Morgan's main body with the artillery was still en route, and he decided the Legion should be engaged by the advance forces.\n\nBy about noon, the Confederates had formed an attack line and were in position to advance on the works. Because of the forest on the west side of the Mauckport Road, a company of men dismounted and attacked the works head on. They were repulsed three times, but the Legion suffered a casualty during the second wave. Simultaneously, the Confederates launched a flanking maneuver on the eastern wing of the defensive works. The initial flanking attempt was prevented because of the superior weapons held by the thirty Legion soldiers on that wing. They were equipped with Henry rifles capable of firing fourteen rounds before reloading, and were able to keep the Confederates pinned down in the open field for about twenty minutes.\n\nShortly after the third repulse of the Confederates on the western wing, the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee regiments arrived from the Mauckport Road and joined the battle, giving the attackers a numerical superiority. At about 12:40 p.m., Capt. Byrnes arrived with the Confederate artillery and used his two ten-pound Parrott rifle cannons to pin down the defenders in the works. In the meantime, Morgan was leading his main body of troops far around the eastern edge of the defenses and up the Plank Road, threatening the town directly and bypassing the defenses entirely. As they moved onto the Corydon Pike, they shot and robbed a toll gate keeper who refused to throw down his gun.\n\nUsing the cannons and one infantry battalion to prevent the defenders from maneuvering, Col. Richard Morgan, the general's brother, launched a pincer movement in an attempt to surround the Legion units. With the artillery bearing down on the works, the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee began to flank the Union defense on the east and west sides respectively. Col. Lewis ordered a retreat to prevent the army from being captured. With their superior numbers, the Confederates were able to move around both ends of the Legion's works and quickly turned the retreat into a rout. The second part of the engagement was over in about twenty-five minutes; in total the battle lasted about one hour. As the Legion fled into the town, many threw their guns into the Indian Creek to prevent them from being captured by the enemy. About one hundred men attempted to escape by the Corydon Pike, unaware that the main Confederate force was advancing up it, and were captured.\n\nA large part of the Legion force, including Col. Jordan, retreated into the downtown. On the western edge of the town, a company of Confederates seized the Legion's commissary. Morgan took command of the heights south of the town and fired two warning shells from his artillery into Corydon, one landing very near Cedar Glade, now a historic site that keeps a marker at the location where the shot landed. Col. Jordan realized that continued resistance was useless and did not \"desire to see the unnecessary loss of life\", and promptly surrendered the town by running up a white flag in the town square. The Legion's cavalry and the infantrymen who had mounts were able to escape into the countryside, but almost all the remaining infantry was captured.\n\nAccounts vary as to the number of casualties, but the most reliable evidence suggests that Jordan lost four killed, ten to twelve wounded, and 355 captured—about 100 escaped. After the battle, Morgan counted eleven dead and forty wounded among the raiders, plus one killed while advancing on the town. Additionally, three civilians were killed.\n\n\nMorgan led his division into Corydon. As the county commissioner exited the courthouse carrying a rifle he was shot dead, becoming the final casualty of the day. Morgan paroled the Legion as if they had been regular soldiers; their weapons and ammunition were seized or destroyed, and they were required to promise not return to arms for a period of time. The prisoners in the county jail were freed, including the Confederates who had been captured the previous day. The cavalrymen spent the afternoon plundering stores and collecting ransom money; Morgan threatened to torch three local mills, and demanded each of them pay $1,000 to prevent their destruction. The owners negotiated the rate down to $500. The county treasurer paid $690 to spare the courthouse from being burnt, and two leading stores paid $600 each. His men robbed the townspeople freely, stealing items ranging from ice-skates and bonnets to guns and horses. The total amount taken by ransom and plunder was estimated at $26,450 ($ in 2009 chained dollars). The value of most of the stolen goods and property destruction was later reimbursed, mostly by the state government.\n\nMorgan ate lunch at the Kintner House Inn where he read a newspaper and learned of the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg and the fall of Vicksburg. The news caused him to realize his army was in serious danger; his hosts later said that upon his reading the paper he was \"noticeably crestfallen.\" Morgan had intended to meet up with the Confederate army in Pennsylvania, but with their forces in retreat this was impossible and began to plan for a safe return across the Ohio River. He had his telegrapher tap the telegraph lines and send false messages indicating he was heading for Indianapolis to free Confederate prisoners of war held at Camp Morton. The Confederate dead were buried in unmarked graves on a farm on the western edge of town. Morgan's wounded were left in the town and were taken into a local Presbyterian church, where they were cared for. The wounded men were paroled after Union troops arrived. Two were taken to the Union army hospital in Jeffersonville, and remained in the town until they were well enough to return home and await their exchange.\n\nShortly after looting the town, detachments of raiders left Corydon and continued their raid, scouring the countryside for fresh horses and food. An African American from Corydon was forced to serve as their guide; he led them for two days before escaping and returning home. By about 6:00 pm Morgan and the main body had resumed their march northward, foraging in northern Harrison County before camping a few miles from Corydon, near New Salisbury. They left Harrison County early the next morning heading north.\n\nAs soon as he learned of the defeat at Corydon, Governor Morton sent a series of telegrams to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, commander of the Army of the Ohio, first requesting then demanding the return of two Indiana regiments recently sent to the defense of Louisville, Kentucky. Burnside refused but did order his cavalry to join in the pursuit of Morgan. As Corydon had until recently been capital of Indiana, the defeat was symbolic. The July 10 headline of the \"Indianapolis Gazetteer\" screamed \"Former Capitol Corydon Ravaged By Morgan's Raiders; Two Hoosiers Dead.\"\n\nMore than 150,000 men turned out to join Legion units during the next week and began pursuing on Morgan's cavalrymen. Gen. Hobson and his men arrived in Corydon on July 10, after crossing the Ohio River from Kentucky. Although a Confederate victory, the Battle of Corydon had delayed Morgan by six crucial hours, allowing the pursuing Union army to begin closing the gap. Union cavalry numbering six thousand men were soon only a few miles behind him. Morgan briefly continued north and raided Salem. He then turned his east to Ohio as his raid turned into flight to escape. He was thwarted at the Battle of Buffington Island, where he tried to cross the Ohio River to safety. Only about 250 of his men were across the river, when Union gunboats brought his attempt to an end. Morgan was later captured at the Battle of Salineville, the furthest north regular Confederates ever reached.\n\nOther raids and small skirmishes took place in Indiana during the war, but the Battle of Corydon was the only pitched battle fought in the state. It remains the last military conflict to have occurred in Indiana. In 1976 the site was preserved as the Corydon Battle Site memorial park and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 9, 1979. Today it is part of the John Hunt Morgan Heritage Trail. The battle has been re-enacted each year since 1980.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In later life he was also a TV presenter and a psychotherapist.\n\nSprague was concerned with how politics affected the ordinary person. \"In essence, the leitmotif of his work is about power and the abuse of power as well as the resilience of ordinary working people to this abuse... It is an art of engagement – engagement for change.\" Martin Rowson said \"Ken's art has the power and strength to inspire. He is the true heir, as a socialist artist, of William Morris.\"\n\nSprague was born in Bournemouth, to a father who was a train driver and a mother who worked in a cardboard box factory. His first work of art, in 1937, in response to the Guernica air raid in the Spanish Civil War, was a linocut made from linoleum torn from the kitchen floor. Printed on his mother's mangle, it was used on collecting sheets for Spain.\n\nHe was educated at Alma Road Elementary School — until it was bombed during World War II — and Porchester Road Secondary Modern School. There the headmaster, noticing his talent, recommended that he apply to the local art college. He won a scholarship to Bournemouth Municipal College and, from 13 and a half, studied graphics — since in those days students of his background were rarely considered for fine arts courses.\n\nOne morning in 1944 he volunteered for the Royal Marines, aged 17, — and that same afternoon, in Southampton, he joined the Communist Party. After basic military training he was transferred to Vickers-Supermarine as a technical artist, working on ejector seats for Spitfires. He was also sent to Yugoslavia to bring back an ejector seat from a German plane the partisans had shot down, during which visit he adopted the big handlebar moustache that was to become his trademark for the rest of his life.\n\nPostwar, and after a summer stint in a circus, he completed his college diploma course in design and illustration. The Communist Party, he told his biographer, was his university, but after the \"Bournemouth Daily Echo\" had labelled him a college revolutionary, local job prospects dwindled. He briefly worked for a volunteer labour battalion in Yugoslavia, and was employed by the Boy Scouts.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1954 Sprague worked in a Carlisle mining company design office — doubling as a cartoonist for the local Conservative and Liberal newspapers. Then came a move to London as the \"Daily Worker\"'s publicity manager, which also had him working as a journalist and cartoonist. Devastated by the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, in 1959 Sprague left to set up, with Ray Barnard, the publicity company, Mountain & Molehill (M&M). Yet he continued producing cartoons for the \"Worker\", and its successor the \"Morning Star\", into the 21st century.\n\nM&M — later The Working Arts — was responsible for some of the most innovative trade union campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s. Sprague told union leaders they had to use publicity to win hearts and minds and to see it as an integral part of union work. And it was Sprague and Barnard who initiated the sensational 1961 visit to Britain of the first man in space, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, inviting the former foundry worker to speak to the Amalgamated Union of Foundry Workers (now part of Amicus). M&M also worked for the Indian High Commission, which led to a meeting with Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nDuring the 1950s and '60s, Sprague also did several set designs for the left-wing Unity Theatre, including productions of George Bernard Shaw's \"The Apple Cart\", Anton Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\" and Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\".\n\nIn the late 1960s Ken began editing the Transport and General Workers' Union’s \"The Record\", transforming it into a lively newspaper, and illustrating it with his own cartoons. In 1976 he edited the anti-fascist magazine \"Searchlight\" for some months, before being sacked when he published a criticism of Israeli oppression of Palestinians.\n\nAs a poster and print-maker he worked with a number of leading progressive organisations and individuals, including Pete Seeger. He drew political cartoons for the \"Daily Worker\" and its successor the \"Morning Star\", and for \"Tribune\" and \"Peace News\". He created posters for among others Martin Luther King and the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp. He created posters against Edward Heath's Industrial Relations Act 1971 and the 1984 miners' strike, but among his most powerful works are those relating to war, including the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Iran–Iraq War, and the Kosovo war. He was a war artist during the Iran–Iraq War, accompanying an Iraqi regiment during an attack on the oil town of Abadan when it lost 582 men in a single day. He met Saddam Hussein and sketched him. He encountered some criticism form comrades, given Hussein's brutal dictatorship (including CIA-supported slaughter of communists), but Sprague maintained he was documenting the horrors of war, the subject which had first brought him to political art. He won several prestigious awards, including poster of the year award from the Council of Industrial Design on two occasions.\n\nHis linocuts for the radical collective Cinema Action's \"Kill The Bill\" film (1971), relating to the Industrial Relations Bill, began an involvement in moving images, which led to Jeff Perks’s 1976 BBC Omnibus documentary \"The Posterman\". This led to a series of Channel 4 films, devised with Jeff Perks and presented by Ken, called \"Everyone A Special Kind Of Artist\" (1986). There was also a 1979 BBC South West series \"The Moving Line\", with Joan Bakewell.\n\nIn 1971 he moved with his wife, Sheila, a talented potter, to Holwell, a farmhouse in Devon, and converted it into an artistic centre. Sheila died of cancer in 1973, but with his second wife, Marcia, he set up the Holwell International Centre for Psychodrama and Sociodrama which continued until 1998. There Ken combined his artistic talents with pedagogic expertise, using them in this new field in which he became a leading practitioner. The project hit difficulties shortly after an unexpected demand for a large VAT payment by HM Revenue and Customs. Ken and Marcia moved to a smaller house, Hoewell, in Lynton, where they continued the work begun in Holwell.\n\nSprague left the Communist Party after its acrimonious split in 1988. He continued to call himself a communist, however, saying “The party left me, I didn’t leave the party”.\n\n\nJohn Green is also the author of other books on socialist activists, like the Jewish East End anti-fascist Aubrey Morris, the trade union leader Ken Gill and a biography of Marx's collaborator Friedrich Engels\n\n"}

At the age of ten, he moved to Mostar to work for the Ottoman aga Tikvina as a wage worker. He worked there until the age of 20, when he returned to his village.\n\nThe Ottoman Turkish taxmen harassed the local population, and at one point robbed his father at gunpoint. Andrijica was enraged and decided to become a hajduk, an outlaw, to fight the Turkish government. He was hunted down and imprisoned on several occasions, as he also pillaged and stole from Muslim and Christian wealthy men in the region. His robberies affected not only Ottoman but also Austro-Hungarian territory in inner Dalmatia, so even the Austrian authorities put a warrant for the arrest of him and his group.\n\nHe was joined by other young men and evaded the authorities for six years. They aimed to be outlaws in a manner similar to Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor peasants.\n\nThe group was pursued by the Austro-Hungarian authorities, and at one point in the village of Zagvozd he shot and killed a member of the police while trying to escape.

{"id": "2206376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206376", "title": "Son of Frankenstein", "text": "Son of Frankenstein\n\nSon of Frankenstein is a 1939 American horror film directed by Rowland V. Lee, and is the third entry in Universal Studios' \"Frankenstein\" series and the last to feature Boris Karloff as the Monster. It is also the first to feature Bela Lugosi as Ygor. The film is the sequel to James Whale's 1935 film \"Bride of Frankenstein\", and stars top-billed Basil Rathbone, Karloff, Lugosi and Lionel Atwill.\n\nThe film was a reaction to the popular re-releases of \"Dracula\" with Lugosi and \"Frankenstein\" with Karloff as a double-feature in 1938. Universal's declining horror output was revitalized with the enormously successful \"Son of Frankenstein\", in which the studio cast both stars.\n\nBaron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), son of Henry Frankenstein, relocates his wife Elsa (Josephine Hutchinson) and their young son Peter (Donnie Dunagan) to the family castle. Wolf wants to redeem his father's reputation, but finds that such a feat will be harder than he thought after he encounters hostility from the villagers, who resent him for the destruction his father's monster wreaked years before. Aside from his family, Wolf's only friend is the local police Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) who bears an artificial arm, his real arm having been \"ripped out by the roots\" in an encounter with the Monster as a child.\n\nWhile investigating his father's castle, Wolf meets Ygor (Bela Lugosi), a demented blacksmith who has survived a hanging for graverobbing and has a deformed neck as a result. Wolf finds the Monster's comatose body in the crypt where his grandfather and father were buried; his father's sarcophagus bears the phrase \"Heinrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters\" written in chalk. He decides to revive the Monster to prove his father was right, and to restore honor to his family. Wolf uses the torch to scratch out the word \"Monsters\" on the casket and write \"Men\" beneath it. \n\nWhen the Monster (Boris Karloff) is revived, it only responds to Ygor's commands and commits a series of murders; the victims were all jurors at Ygor's trial. Wolf discovers this and confronts Ygor. Wolf shoots Ygor and apparently kills him. The Monster abducts Wolf's son as revenge, but cannot bring himself to kill the child. Krogh and Wolf pursue the Monster to the nearby laboratory, where a struggle ensues, during which the Monster tears out Krogh's false arm. Wolf swings on a rope and knocks the Monster into a molten sulphur pit under the laboratory, saving his son.\n\nWolf leaves the keys to Frankenstein's castle to the villagers. The film ends with the village turning out to cheer the Frankenstein family as they leave by train.\n\nAfter the ousting of the Laemmles from Universal and the British embargo on American horror films in 1936, Karloff and Lugosi found themselves in a career slump. For two years, horror films were out of the Universal Studios lineup. On April 5, 1938, a nearly bankrupt theater in Los Angeles staged a desperate stunt by showing \"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\" and \"King Kong\" as a triple feature. The impressive box office results led to similarly successful revivals nationwide. Universal soon decided to make a big-budget \"Frankenstein\" sequel.\nAs director James Whale was similarly in a slump and did not wish to make any more horror films, Universal selected Rowland V. Lee to direct \"Son of Frankenstein\". Lee's film explores dramatic themes: family, security, isolation, responsibility and father-son relationships.\n\n\"Son of Frankenstein\" marks changes in the Monster's character from \"Bride of Frankenstein\". The Monster is duller and no longer speaks, explained by being injured by a lightning strike. The monster also wore a giant fur vest, not seen in the first two Frankenstein films, perhaps to add color to his appearance when the film was planned to be shot in color. He is fond of Ygor and obeys his orders. The Monster shows humanity in three scenes: first when he is disturbed by his image in a mirror, especially when compared to the Baron. Next, when he discovers Ygor's body, letting out a powerful scream, and later when he contemplates killing Peter but changes his mind. While the first two films were clearly set in the 1900s, this film appears to take place in the 1930s, judging by the appearance of a modern automobile.\n\nPeter Lorre was originally cast as Baron Wolf von Frankenstein, but he had to leave the production when he became ill. Replacing Lorre was Basil Rathbone, who had scored a major triumph as Sir Guy of Gisbourne in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\".\n\nAccording to the documentary \"Universal Horror\" (1998), the film was intended to be shot in color and some Technicolor test footage was filmed, but for artistic or budgetary reasons the plan was abandoned. No color test footage is known to survive, but a clip from a Kodachrome color home movie filmed at the studio and showing Boris Karloff in the green monster makeup, clowning around with makeup artist Jack Pierce, is included in the same documentary.\n\nThe film was commercially successful and helped return Universal Studios to profitability. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91%, based on 23 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Boris Karloff's final appearance as the Monster is a fitting farewell before the series descended into self-parody\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that the film could be considered \"the silliest picture ever made\", yet implements \"a very shrewd silliness, perpetrated by a good director in the best traditions of cinematic horror, so that even while you laugh at its nonsense you may be struck with the notion that perhaps that's as good a way of enjoying oneself at a movie as any\". In a \"Variety\" review, the film was noted as being \"well mounted, nicely directed, and includes [a] cast of capable artists\".\n\nJim Hoberman of \"The Village Voice\" praised Lugosi's performance as Ygor, writing that he \"pretty much steals the movie in his last really juicy role\". In a contemporary review, the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" stated that \"since the whole atmosphere of the film is so far removed from everyday reality it is impossible to take the horrors very seriously\", though noting that for a film \"of its kind, however, the production is good and of a high technical quality\", and praised the performances of Rathbone and Atwill.\n\nAfter the phenomenal success of \"Son of Frankenstein\", Karloff decided not to return to the role of the Monster, feeling that the character was becoming the butt of jokes. Also \"Son of Frankenstein\" marked the final \"A\" production of Universal's Frankenstein films, which later went to \"B\" films, beginning with \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" in 1942 in which Lon Chaney, Jr. took over the role of the Monster and Lugosi returned as Ygor. Lugosi himself would go on to play the Monster in \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\" in 1943, while Karloff would return to the franchise as another character in 1944's \"House of Frankenstein\" (as well as playing Baron von Frankenstein in the later non-Universal films \"Mad Monster Party?\" and \"Frankenstein 1970\"). Karloff would not don the Monster makeup again for film until a comedic episode of the television series \"Route 66\" in the 1960s titled \"Lizard's Leg and Owlet's Wing,\" which also featured Lon Chaney Jr. and Peter Lorre.\n\n\n"}

When they start dating and Lisa is unable to reform him, she ends their relationship. In the subplot, Homer uses an autodialer in a telemarketing scheme which annoys all of Springfield's residents.\n\nSuperintendent Chalmers visits Principal Skinner at Springfield Elementary School to show off his newly purchased 1979 Honda Accord. Chalmers is distraught when he discovers the car's hood ornament is missing. Skinner orders a search of every student's locker which reveals that Nelson Muntz, the school bully, is the culprit. As punishment, Nelson is forced to return all stolen items found in his locker to their owners; he is also made to perform janitorial work with Groundskeeper Willie.\n\nLisa is caught staring at Nelson during band practice and unwittingly causes a commotion among the band students. After she receives detention and is forced to write a contrite message on a chalkboard, she wonders aloud how Bart does this each week. Lisa realizes she has a crush on Nelson and gets Milhouse to pass a love note to him in class. Nelson thinks Milhouse wrote the love note and beats him. Lisa confesses to Nelson that she wrote the note and soon they share a first kiss at Springfield Observatory.\n\nLisa vows to turn Nelson from a troublemaker into a sweet, well-behaved young man. However, the influence of Nelson's friends Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney prevails when they convince him to vandalize Principal Skinner's house. After Skinner calls the police, the four boys flee. Nelson takes refuge at Lisa's house and insists he is innocent; Lisa believes him until he unwittingly reveals he was involved in the boys' prank. Lisa realizes that she cannot reform Nelson and gently ends their relationship.\n\nIn the subplot, Chief Wiggum arrests a scam artist for telemarketing fraud. Homer witnesses the arrest and retrieves the discarded autodialer from a trash bin. He uses the machine for a telemarketing scheme to persuade everyone to send him money under the name \"Happy Dude\". His phone calls annoy the whole town and Chief Wiggum catches him. Instead of confiscating the autodialer and taking Homer into custody, he shoots it and asks Homer to bring it to his court hearing lest the charges be dismissed for lack of evidence. In the closing credits, the repaired autodialer plays Homer's new, court-ordered message asking residents to forgive him by sending money to \"Sorry Dude\".\n\nThe idea of Lisa dating Nelson had been around for a while, with several different versions being pitched. The writers wanted a \"silly\" Homer story to balance the episode out, and the idea of using the telemarketing scam for this had also been around for a while. By this time, the show had begun to have episodes revolving around secondary characters. This was the first episode to revolve around Nelson, and was done to partly explain why Nelson acts the way he does. The words to Nelson's song were contributed by Mike Scully's daughters. The scene in which Milhouse passes Lisa's note to Nelson was written by Bill Oakley, with the line, \"He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze\", being George Meyer's line. There was a debate as to how injured Milhouse should look without it looking disturbing, and the drop of blood coming from his nose was decided to be enough. Milhouse liking Vaseline on toast was based on a child from Josh Weinstein's school days who everyday would get onto the bus with a piece of toast, which had Vaseline on it.\n\nA majority of the story is a reference to the film \"Rebel Without a Cause\". Lisa remarks that Nelson is \"like a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a vest\", a reference to \"a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma\"; this was Winston Churchill's opinion of Russia at the outbreak of World War II.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Lisa's Date with Density\" finished 63rd in ratings for the week of December 9–15, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 7.4, equivalent to approximately 7.2 million viewing households. It was the fifth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\", \"Melrose Place\", \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" and \"Party of Five\".\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \"impressive\" how \"even after Nelson has beaten [Milhouse] up for apparently making a pass, [Milhouse] will still do anything for uncaring Lisa.\" \n\nJosh Weinstein called it one of the most \"real\" episodes, commenting that every character in the episode, from Superintendent Chalmers to Lisa, acts like a real person throughout. The medic's line \"He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze\" is one of Matt Groening's favorites. Marge's line \"When I first met your father, he was loud, crude and piggish. But I worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person\", is one of Susie Dietter's favorites, as it explains why Marge is still married to Homer despite his actions.\n\nYeardley Smith, the voice actress of Lisa, has mentioned this episode is one of her favorite \"Simpsons\" episodes of all time. \n\nThis is also one of several episodes that has been performed live by the cast in front of an audience.\n\n"}

Flynn is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling between 1996 and 2000. He is also known for his appearances in Japan with puroresu promotions including Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi and New Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\nJerry Flynn's professional wrestling career began with training under Boris Malenko. He made his debut in FMW in 1989. During this time, he befriended fellow student Michael Bollea, later known as Horace Hogan.\n\nIn 1991, Flynn debuted in the Japanese shoot style wrestling promotion Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi and remained there for a few years. This period also saw Flynn face Masakatsu Funaki on the co-promotional SWS/WWF SuperWrestle card on December 12, 1991.\n\nFlynn wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation in June and July 1995 during a tour of the Mid-Atlantic states and Midwestern United States. Flynn made appearances on \"WWF Monday Night RAW\", \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\" and \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\", losing to WWF performers including Jean-Pierre LaFitte, Rad Radford, The Roadie and Waylon Mercy.\n\nBy 1996, Flynn had worked as a jobber for the WWF, performing in a few house shows before making his way into WCW with help from Brian Blair, a friend of road agent Paul Orndorff, and Mark Starr, who helped gain Flynn a tryout at Universal Studios Florida for a \"WCW WorldWide\" taping. He began performing regularly on WCW's secondary TV program, \"WCW Saturday Night\", in 1997 and by the following year was gaining numerous wins over low-card performers.\n\nIn 1998, Flynn began to elevate his status, wrestling on \"Monday Nitro\", the company's flagship program. He had a series of matches with Bill Goldberg, which saw Flynn come close to beating Goldberg, but ended up losing, adding several notches in Goldberg's streak, until his defeat by Kevin Nash at Starrcade. In 1999, he had a short-lived feud with Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller and his manager Sonny Onoo after Miller and Onoo attacked Flynn backstage during an interview with Gene Okerlund and cut off his hair. The feud ended when Flynn gained revenge by defeating Miller and Onoo in a handicap match at the Uncensored pay-per-view. Later that year, he unsuccessfully participated in the Junkyard Invitational at Bash at the Beach.\n\nHe then became a member of The First Family, a heel stable managed by Jimmy Hart. However, an injury Flynn sustained led to the eventual disestablishment of the group. In November 1999, Flynn and Juventud Guerrera were arrested for DUI. He then began a feud with mixed martial arts fighter Tank Abbott which Flynn later expressed enthusiasm for. During this time, Flynn's persona emphasized his shootfighting skills including a \"shootfight rules\" match against The Wall on \"Thunder\". His feud with Abbott culminated at the 2000 Souled Out where Abbott defeated him via knock-out in a mere 1:39. He was released in April of that year.\n\nIn November and December 1998, Flynn returned to Japan, where he wrestled for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). Flynn formed a tag team with Dave Finlay, with whom he competed in the annual Super Grade Tag League, a round robin tag team tournament. The tournament was won by Keiji Mutoh and Satoshi Kojima.\n\nOn September 19, 2000 in Tampa, Florida, he also unsuccessfully faced Mike Rapada in a tournament final for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He wrestled a tour of Puerto Rico for World Wrestling Council, where he briefly held the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship in February 2001, before retiring.\n\nJerry Flynn has a black belt in taekwondo, and he briefly owned and operated his own school of martial arts. Flynn fought mixed martial arts in the WCC (World Combat Championship) losing to Fred Floyd in an alternate bout. Prior to entering professional wrestling, Flynn was employed as a Tae Kwon Do instructor in his hometown of Tampa, FL.\n\n\n"}

His name can hardly be separated from that of his friend and compatriot, Joseph Méry (1798–1866), with whom he carried on so intimate a collaboration that it is not possible to distinguish their personalities in their joint works.\n\nAfter having established some local reputation as a poet, Barthélemy went to Paris, where by one of his first efforts, \"Le Sacre de Charles X\" (1825) he gained the favor of the court. His energies, however, were soon enlisted in the service of the opposition party. In 1825 appeared a clever political satire, \"Les Sidiennes\", followed by \"La Villéliade ou la prise du château de Rivoli\" (1827), \"La Corbiéréide\" (1827), \"La Peyronnéide\", the joint productions of Barthélemy and Méry. The success was immediate and pronounced; fifteen editions of the \"Villéliade\" were called for during the year. A rapid succession of political squibs and satires was now poured forth by the authors, among the most remarkable being \"Biographie des quarante de l’Académie française\" (1826) and \"Napoléon en Égypte\" (1828), which passed through nearly a dozen editions in a year.\n\nIn 1829 Barthélemy was imprisoned and fined 1000 francs for the publication of their \"Fils de l’homme\", a poem on the Duke of Reichstadt, Napoleon's son. The July Revolution of 1830 liberated him; and in company with Méry, he celebrated the triumph of the people in one of their most brilliant efforts, \"L’Insurrection\". From March 1831 to April 1832 they produced a series of verse satires issued weekly, \"the Némésis\", attacking the government and ministers of Louis Philippe. The small pension of which Barthélemy was the recipient was stopped. When the publication ceased there was a strong suspicion that Barthélemy had been paid for his silence, although a collection of the satires went through several editions in the 1830s. In 1832 he published an anonymous poem, supporting some acts of the government which were peculiarly obnoxious to the liberal faction of the Orléanist party. This change of front destroyed his influence and his later writings passed unnoticed.\n\nFor the next few years he enjoyed a handsome pension from the government and refrained from all satirical writing. He again resumed his old style in 1844. and a collection of 24 satires entitled \"Nouvelle Némésis\" was published in 1845, but, apparently, without the former success. From that date he contented himself with occasional poems. Barthélemy died on 23 August 1867 in Marseilles.\n\n"}

Johnson & Son, Inc. for a polyethylene food wrap. The Saran trade name was first owned by Dow Chemical for polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), along with other monomers. The formulation was changed to polyethylene in 2004 due to the problematic chlorine content of PVDC.\n\nSince its accidental discovery in 1933, polyvinylidene chloride has been used for a number of commercial and industrial products. When formed into a thin plastic film, the principal advantages of polyvinylidene chloride, when compared to other plastics, are its ability to adhere to itself and its very low permeability to water vapor, flavor and aroma molecules, and oxygen. This oxygen barrier prevents food spoilage, while the film barrier to flavor and aroma molecules helps food retain its flavor and aroma.\n\nPolyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) was discovered at Dow Chemical Company (Michigan, USA) in 1933 when a lab worker, Ralph Wiley, was having trouble washing beakers used in his process of developing a dry-cleaning product. It was initially developed into a spray that was used on US fighter planes and, later, automobile upholstery, to protect them from the elements. Dow Chemical later named the product Saran and eliminated its green hue and offensive odor.\n\nIn 1942, fused layers of original-specification PVDC were used to make woven mesh ventilating insoles for newly developed jungle or tropical combat boots made of rubber and canvas. These insoles were tested by experimental Army units in jungle exercises in Panama, Venezuela, and other countries, where they were found to increase the flow of dry outside air to the insole and base of the foot, reducing blisters and tropical ulcers. The PVDC ventilating mesh insole was later adopted by the United States Army for standard issue in its M-1945 and M-1966 Jungle Boots. In 1943, John Reilly (Ralph Wiley's boss) and Ralph Wiley of The Dow Chemical Co. completed the final work needed for introduction of PVDC, which had been invented in 1939. PVDC monofilaments were also extruded for the first time. The word \"Saran\" was coined by a combination of John Reilly's wife's and daughter's names, Sarah and Ann Reilly.\n\nIn 1949, Dow introduced Saran Wrap, a thin, clingy plastic wrap that was sold in rolls and used primarily for wrapping food. It quickly became popular for preserving food items stored in the refrigerator. Saran Wrap was later acquired by S. C. Johnson & Son. \n\nAfter the end of the Vietnam War, the U.S. military phased out PVDC insoles in favor of Poron®, a microcellular urethane, for its jungle and combat boots. However, the British Army continues to use PVDC insoles in its combat boots, primarily because of its insulating properties.\n\nToday's Saran Wrap is no longer composed of PVDC in the United States, due to cost, processing difficulties, and environmental concerns with halogenated materials, and is now made from polyethylene. However, polyethylene has a higher oxygen permeability, which in turn affects food spoilage prevention. For example, at 23 °C and 95% relative humidity polyvinylidene chloride has an oxygen permeability of 0.6 cm μm m d kPa while low-density polyethylene under the same conditions has an oxygen permeability of 2000 cm μm m d kPa. For that reason, packaging for the meat industry still may use PVDC containing films, as a barrier layer.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the name Saran is a registered trademark of the Dow Chemical Company, while in others, it has lost trademark status and become a generic term for these polymers. In Japan, Dow's trademark rights in Saran Wrap were assigned to Asahi Kasei, which uses polyvinylidene chloride.\n\n"}
{"id": "2206417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206417", "title": "Frankenstein Created Woman", "text": "Frankenstein Created Woman\n\nFrankenstein Created Woman is a 1967 British Hammer horror film directed by Terence Fisher. It stars Peter Cushing as Baron Frankenstein and Susan Denberg as his new creation. It is the fourth film in Hammer's \"Frankenstein\" series.\n\nWhere Hammer's previous Frankenstein films were concerned with the physical aspects of the Baron's work, the interest here is in the metaphysical dimensions of life, such as the question of the soul, and its relationship to the body.\n\nA man is taken from a cart and taunts the police and the priest escorting him to the guillotine, where he is to be executed for murder. The man spots his son, Hans, in a nearby copse and begs that he should not see him die. Despite the priest's attempts to shoo him away, Hans watches as his father is positioned under the blade. He yells, \"Papa!\" Then the blade falls, and Hans flees.\n\nYears later, Hans is working as an assistant to Baron Victor Frankenstein. The Baron, with the help of Dr Hertz, is in the process of discovering a way of trapping the soul of a recently deceased person. Frankenstein believes he can transfer that soul into another recently deceased body to restore it to life. As a test, Hertz, under Frankenstein's instruction, freezes him to death and unfreezes him again, thus bringing him back to life. Frankenstein is pleased that the experiment works. \n\nHans is also the lover of Christina, daughter of innkeeper Kleve. Christina's entire left side is disfigured and partly paralysed. Young dandies Anton, Johann and Karl frequent Kleve's inn, yet refuse to pay. Johann threatens to have his father revoke Kleve's license if he complains. The three insist that they be served by Christina and mock her for her deformities. The taunting angers Hans, who fights the three of them and cuts Anton's face with a knife.\n\nEventually, Kleve throws the dandies out. They return in the night to steal wine from his inn and when Kleve catches them, they beat him to death. Hans, the son of a murderer known for his short temper, is convicted. Despite the Baron and Hertz's defenses against the accusations, Hans is executed by the guillotine. Seeing this as an opportunity, Frankenstein gets hold of Hans' fresh corpse and traps his soul.\n\nDistraught over Hans's death, Christina drowns herself. The peasants bring her body to Dr Hertz to see if he can do anything. Frankenstein and Hertz transfer Hans' soul into her body. Over months of complex and intensive treatment, they cure her physical deformities. The result is a physically healthy woman with no memory. Frankenstein insists on telling her nothing but her name and keeping her in Hertz's house. Despite coming to her senses regarding her identity, Christina is taken over by the spirit of the vengeful Hans.\n\nShe kills Anton and Karl, driven mostly by the ghostly insistence of Hans. Frankenstein and Hertz become rather suspicious of her behaviour surrounding the killings and take her to the guillotine where Hans and his father were executed. However, they believe she subconsciously retains the memories of Hans' father's death rather than of Hans. By the time Frankenstein realises the truth, he finds her already murdering Johann. Despite Frankenstein's pleas, Christina knows she now has no one and nothing left to live for, and drowns herself again.\n\n\n\"Frankenstein Created Woman\" was originally mooted as a follow-up to \"The Revenge of Frankenstein\" during its production in 1958, at a time when Roger Vadim's \"Et Dieu créa la femme\" (\"And God Created Woman\") was successful (in fact, the film's original working title was And Then Frankenstein Created Woman). The film finally went into production at Bray Studios on 4 July 1966. It was Hammer's penultimate production there.\n\n\"Variety\" wrote that the film has \"the excellent technical aspects which have come to be expected of the Hammer Film people,\" but that the script \"often seems overly influenced by other and better-written screen efforts.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" expressed disappointment that the film did not focus on Frankenstein's work, but that the script was rather \"more concerned with the gory murder spree which follows in the wake of Christina's restoration,\" concluding that \"the poverty of the script is little compensation for the loss of the old tradition.\" Leonard Maltin is blunt: \"everything goes wrong, including script.\" \"Halliwell's Film and Video Guide\" describes this film as a crude and gory farrago\" while the \"Time Out Film Guide\" says it is \"full of cloying Keatsian imagery which somehow transcends the more idiotic aspects of the plot.\"\n\nSome commentators on \"Frankenstein Created Woman\" have been more positive. Martin Scorsese picked the movie as part of a 1987 National Film Theatre season of his favourite films, saying \"If I single this one out it's because here they actually isolate the soul... The implied metaphysics are close to something sublime.\"\nThe film currently holds 60% on Rotten Tomatoes.\nAccording to Fox records, the double feature of this film and \"The Mummy’s Shroud\" needed to earn $1,625,000 in rentals to break even and made $1,590,000, meaning it made a loss.‘\n\n\"Frankenstein Created Woman\" was released in October 2013 in the U.K. and on 28 January in the U.S.A. Each disc featured a restored version of the film, the episodes of \"World of Hammer\" episodes included on the DVD released by Anchor Bay over a decade before. Among the highlights is an audio commentary with actors Robert Morris and Derek Fowlds, moderated by Hammer expert Jonathan Rigby.\n\n\n"}

Common lyrical themes found in the band's music include Viking culture, recollection of a pre-Christian world, and Norse folklore. A number of their recent songs also contain references to J. R. R. Tolkien. Unleashed (along with Dismember, Entombed and Grave) is considered one of the \"big four\" of Swedish death metal.\n\nUnleashed was founded in 1989 by vocalist and bassist Johnny Hedlund. Unleashed recorded demos \"Revenge\" and \"Utter Dark\", which got them a record deal with the German label Century Media Records. In 1991, the band released their debut studio album, \"Where No Life Dwells\", and toured with Morbid Angel in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn 1992, Unleashed released their second studio album, \"Shadows in the Deep\", including a cover version of Venom's \"Countess Bathory\". Their next studio albums were \"Across the Open Sea\" in 1993 and \"Victory\" in 1995, the latter being the last album which guitarist Fredrik Lindgren played on. Lindgren began to focus strongly on playing punk rock, so Unleashed replaced him with Fredrik Folkare, who played guitar on the fifth Unleashed studio album \"Warrior\" in 1997.\nThe band went on hiatus after 7–8 years of recording and touring. They were concentrating on life outside the music business, their musical side projects, and studying. After a reissue of the band's classics in 2002, the band released a new album called \"Hell's Unleashed\" in the same year, and they began to tour once again. This was also the same year Hedlund had come under scrutiny because of allegations that he was a Nazi sympathizer. Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters initially had intended to approach Hedlund, hoping he would contribute lead vocals to one of the songs for his Probot metal project, but the album producer, Matt Sweeney, discouraged him from doing so because of the rumors of Hedlund's alleged sympathies. Hedlund quickly branded these accusations as false and stated, \"Unleashed praises nature, beast and man. Man...regardless of background, place of birth or color of the skin\".\n\nIn 2004, Unleashed released their seventh studio album, \"Sworn Allegiance\". In October 2006, the band released their eighth studio album, \"Midvinterblot\". Unleashed toured Europe in November 2006 as part of the Masters of Death tour, with Grave, Dismember, and Entombed. On February and March 2007, they headlined a North American tour with Krisiun and Belphegor. June 2008 saw the release of their ninth studio album entitled \"Hammer Battalion\".\n\nOn July 24, 2009 Unleashed signed a contract with German label Nuclear Blast Records for the release of their tenth album entitled \"As Yggdrasil Trembles\". In the press statement the band said, \"We are very much looking forward to this new cooperation! The recording of the album is scheduled for October/November this year.\"\n\nIn summer 2010 Unleashed was part of the Summer Breeze Open Air and the With Full Force heavy metal festivals in Germany. The band's 11th studio album \"Odalheim\" was released also on Nuclear Blast Records in April 2012, and their twelfth record \"Dawn of the Nine\" was released April 24, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the only remaining all-boys Catholic boarding school in Britain, \nand has announced that it will become co-educational from September 2020.\nFounded in 1859 by John Henry Newman, The Oratory has historical ties to the Birmingham Oratory and is the only school founded by Newman. Although a separate entity from the nearby Oratory Preparatory School, it shares a board of governors and a common history. Newman founded the school with the intention of providing boys with a Roman Catholic alternative to Eton College.\nAccording to the \"Good Schools Guide\", the school \"enjoys inspirational leadership, has achieved GSG 'overall best in UK' for three years running and is consistently at the top of the tree\", with \"state-of-the-art\" boarding facilities and an ongoing refurbishment programme under way.\n\nThe \"Independent Schools Inspectorate\" said in 2007: \"Pupils and staff show deep and committed support to the Catholic values that underpin the school\", and \"genuine excitement and enjoyment shine through in sporting, musical and creative activities. Individual pupils and teams have achieved distinction in a wide range of activities, particularly in sport\", and pupils \"have recently represented Great Britain in rowing, shooting and real tennis, England in cricket and Ireland in rugby\".\n\nThe Oratory School was founded in 1859. The first boys arrived before work began on 1 May that year. The objective was to provide a Roman Catholic alternative to other schools, particularly for the sons of converts from Anglicanism who considered existing Catholic schools culturally and socially inferior.\n\nThe school has an orchestral and choral tradition, with former choristers of Westminster Cathedral among the pupils. The school's professional youth choir, known as the 'Schola Cantorum', has over 40 pupils and demands high performance caliber and therefore standard auditions and requirements. They have performed at venues such as Windsor Castle and for the Pope, as well as frequent public performances around the country, most commonly London, most recently Nelson's mass and Zadok the Priest in Hyde Park. Several choristers have recently joined the National Youth Choir of Great Britain.\n\nThe Oratory is one of five schools in the United Kingdom with a real tennis court (others being Radley, Canford, and Wellington College) and plays this sport, hosting championships and international tournaments. It was the first location in the United Kingdom to construct a Real Tennis court for 80 years, finishing the building in 1990. Over recent years the UK Professional Singles Tournament has been held at the court, and in April 2006 the World Championships were held there in which world no. 1 Rob Fahey (Australia) beat USA player Tim Chisholm.\nThe current head master is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.\n\n\nIn February 2013, it was discovered that Jonathan O'Brien, a former teacher, had been involved in sexually abusing boys aged ten to sixteen while working at The Oratory in the 1980s. O'Brien was sentenced to thirteen years imprisonment.\n\nIn February 2014, there were allegations that an older pupil had been beating younger students and killing animals outside school.\n\nIn May 2018, it was reported that several sixth form students had attended their informal leavers' day photo as slaves and 'cotton pickers'. When the group of boys arrived for the photo they were turned away by the headmaster. The students later returned to the school and a photo of them within the school grounds was shared on social media. The students later stated that several of their black friends supported their choice of costumes and had joined in by dressing as the slave owners. A spokesman for the school apologised for the students' behaviour and said that the school condemned all forms of racist behaviour.\nFormer pupils include tenor Gervase Elwes, war artist Simon Elwes, Rugby Union player Danny Cipriani, Olympic gold medallist John Pius Boland, Victoria Cross recipient Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, Made in Chelsea stars Francis Boulle & Frederik Ferrier, and Portuguese royal Afonso, Prince of Beira.\n\n\n\n"}

There was a group of blues and rock musicians founded by guitarist Paul Kossoff (ex-Free), signing to Atlantic Records (courtesy of Ahmet Ertegün) in 1975. The band took the name from Kossoff's solo album, \"Back Street Crawler\". Terry Wilson, Mike Montgomery and Tony Braunagel had played together in the short lived Bloontz, whose only album was released in 1973 and included versions of the Mike Montgomery songs, \"Jason Blue\" and \"The Band Plays On\", both of which featured on Back Street Crawler's album \"The Band Plays On\".\n\nThe band's progress would continually be overshadowed by Kossoff's well publicised drug dependency. His reliance on narcotics was common knowledge. Ultimately, his addiction to narcotics led to his eventual demise.\n\nA headlining tour was conducted in the UK during May and June 1975, prior to finalising sessions for the album \"The Band Plays On\". To push the album, a further series of live dates were announced. However, these shows were curtailed when Kossoff was taken ill with a stomach ulcer. Whilst receiving treatment, Kossoff's condition worsened and suffered a cardiac arrest. Four live concerts, in Liverpool, Glasgow, Newcastle and London, were undertaken in November.\n\nKeyboard player Mike Montgomery quit the band shortly afterwards, to be replaced by John 'Rabbit' Bundrick for a series of American concerts in early 1976. Again, ill-health on Kossoff's part, including the guitarist breaking his fingers, resulted in numerous shows being cancelled.\n\nThe band set to work on their second album, working with producer Glyn Johns, in a variety of studios in New York and Los Angeles. With Kossoff still obviously ailing, session musician W.G. 'Snuffy' Walden committed much of the guitar to tape, Kossoff later playing lead over the mostly completed tracks. Walden also performed live, in the absence of Kossoff, with the band in February 1976. With Kossoff resuming his position, the band headlined four shows at the Starwood in West Hollywood. During the run of shows, Bad Company, were performing at the Los Angeles Forum and they joined Back Street Crawler onstage for two nights. The final night of the engagement, on March 3, 1976, was to be the final performance of both Paul Kossoff and Back Street Crawler.\n\nA British tour with AC/DC as support act was set to commence on April 25, 1976. On March 19, Paul Kossoff died from cerebral and pulmonary edema on an overnight flight from Los Angeles to New York. Following Kossoff's death, the band continued under the name of Crawler.\n\n\n"}

The Samoans held 21 tag team championships around the world.\n\nThe Wild Samoans rarely spoke in interviews, instead grunting in a primitive dialect that only their manager Capt. Lou Albano could understand. They had afros and fu manchu moustaches. Completing their \"wild man\" image, the duo engaged in outrageous behavior such as nose picking, biting opponents, and eating raw fish during interviews.\n\nThe team began its career in Stu Hart's Calgary, Alberta Canada based Stampede Wrestling in 1973, where they won the Stampede International Tag Team Championship on two occasions. Then they went to Vancouver and won the tag titles there. In 1975 they made their debut in the United States for Big Time Wrestling in Detroit. They spent the majority of the 1970s in various National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) territories.\n\nIn 1979, the Wild Samoans joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). They were initially billed as simply \"The Samoans\" before reverting to their better-known name. They made their Madison Square Garden debut on January 21, 1980 in a WWF Tag Team Championship match against Tito Santana and Ivan Putski, who retained their title. In the upcoming months, both men became contenders for Bob Backlund's WWF Championship, but neither man won the gold. They, however, won their first championship in the WWF, the tag team championship, by defeating Santana and Putski on April 12, 1980. They reigned as champions for approximately five months, until dropping the title to Backlund and Pedro Morales in a two out of three falls match at Showdown at Shea. Because Backlund was already the reigning WWF Champion, the team had to forfeit the title, and a tournament was held to crown new tag champions. On September 8, 1980, the Wild Samoans defeated Tony Garea and Rene Goulet in the tournament finals to win the title. Their reign lasted for one month, until they lost to Garea and his new partner, Rick Martel. The Wild Samoans feuded with the champions for the rest of the year, but they were not able to recapture the gold.\n\nIn late 1981, changing their name back to the Samoans they joined Mid-South Wrestling. With, \"Big Cat\" Ernie Ladd as their financial adviser, and manager and then changing their team name from The Samoans to The Samoan Warriors with which they won the Mid-South Tag Team Championship and feuded with Junkyard Dog and Dick Murdoch. After also attacking Ladd, the two began a feud with their former adviser. In response, Ladd when their contract was bought out by Skandor Akbar in response Ladd formed a team with \"Iron\" Mike Sharpe, with whom he forced the Wild Samoans to leave Mid-South.\n\nAfter leaving Mid-South, the duo appeared in Georgia Championship Wrestling. As part of the territory, they defeated the Fabulous Freebirds for the NWA National Tag Team Championship, which they later vacated.\n\nThe Wild Samoans eventually ended up back in the World Wrestling Federation with their former manager Capt. Lou Albano in 1982. This time they grew full beards that were scruffy and bushy looking. Afa and Sika began their third WWF Tag Team Championship reign on March 8, 1983 by defeating Chief Jay and Jules Strongbow. In a rematch on March 19, they were also victorious. Also during this time, while feuding with Rocky Johnson, Jimmy Snuka, and André the Giant, the duo added Afa's son Samula to their team, first as a replacement for Sika when he got hurt, then as their backup upon his return.\n\nThey lost their tag team title to the team of Rocky Johnson and Tony Atlas on November 15. During the match, Albano tried to interfere on the Samoans behalf by attempting to hit Atlas over the head with a chair. He accidentally hit Afa instead, however, and Atlas covered him for the win. The North-South Connection, Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch, would later defeat Atlas and Johnson for the tag titles on April 17, 1984. The Samoans turned face and challenged them in a lengthy feud. After failing to regain the belts, the duo eventually left the WWF in 1985 and reappeared in Pro Wrestling USA (NWA/AWA) where they had a dream match vs the Road Warriors. The bout ended in a Double DQ .\n\nSika reappeared for a lengthy run in the WWF from 1986–88, now managed by Mr. Fuji, performing both in singles competition and as a tag team (partnered with Kamala). Kamala and Sika's biggest match as a tag team was a loss to the Can-Am Connection on \"Superstars of Wrestling\". Sika also participated in the invitational battle royal that opened Wrestlemania IV. He was the second one eliminated.\n\nAfa returned to WWF in 1992 and went on to manager his son, Samu and his nephew Fatu as The Headshrinkers. He left the WWF in 1995.\n\nAfter WWF and AWA they went to wrestle in the independent circuit from 1986-1991. In 1987 they made a few appearances in National Wrestling Federation.\n\nOn September 10, 1988 they lost to Jimmy Valiant and Rufus R. Jones by disqualification at World Wrestling Council's 15th Anversio 1988 in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 1991 they split up and both men went their separate ways. Sika would retire from wrestling and trained wrestlers at the Wild Samoans Training Center. Afa managed The Headshrinkers in the WWF from 1992-1995. After WWF, Afa continued to train other wrestlers.\n\nIn 1996 Afa, founded World Xtreme Wrestling based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn August 15, 1997 both men reunited for one night teaming with Disco Inferno, Gene Ligon and the Big Cheese as they defeated Ken Timbs, George Love, Jay Love, Gary Royal and Kane Adams at IWA Night Of The Legends in Kannapolis, North Carolina.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Afa Anoa'i opened the Wild Samoans Training Center, and the school's graduates include Paul Orndorff, Junkyard Dog, Luna Vachon, Michael P.S.

In 2001, it became the first public course to be selected as the No. 1 Golf Course in America by \"Golf Digest\". Greens fees are among the highest in the world, at $525 (plus $40 cart fee or $92.50 caddie fee for non-resort guests) per round in 2018.\n\nFour of the courses in the coastal community of Pebble Beach, including Pebble Beach Golf Links, belong to the Pebble Beach Company, which also operates three hotels and a spa at the resort. The other courses are The Links at Spanish Bay, Spyglass Hill Golf Course, and Del Monte Golf Course.\nThe PGA Tour and PGA Tour Champions play annual events at Pebble Beach, AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the First Tee Open. It has hosted six men's major championships: six U.S. Opens and a PGA Championship. It also hosted the 1988 Nabisco Championship, now known as the Tour Championship, the season-ending event on the PGA Tour. World-renowned, the course is included in many golf video games, such as the \"Links\" series and the \"Tiger Woods PGA Tour\" series.\n\nThe course began as part of the complex of the Hotel del Monte, a resort hotel in Monterey, California, built by Charles Crocker, one of the California's Big Four railroad barons, through Southern Pacific Railroad's property division, Pacific Improvement Company. The hotel first opened on June 10, 1880. The famous 17-Mile Drive was originally designed as a local excursion route for visitors to the Del Monte to take in the historic sights of Monterey and Pacific Grove and the scenery of what would become Pebble Beach.\n\nThe course was designed by Jack Neville and Douglas Grant and opened on February 22, 1919. Neville also designed the back nine at Pacific Grove Municipal Golf Course on the other side of the Monterey Peninsula. His objective was to place as many of the holes as possible along the rocky and beautiful Monterey coast line. This was accomplished using a \"figure 8\" layout.\n\nThe course was extensively revised in 1928 by H. Chandler Egan. Other architects who have worked on the course include Alistair MacKenzie and Robert Hunter (1927) and Jack Nicklaus (creation of the new fifth hole, 1998).\n\nOn February 27, 1919, Samuel Finley Brown Morse formed the Del Monte Properties Company, and acquired the extensive holdings of the Pacific Improvement Company, which included the Del Monte Forest, the Del Monte Lodge and the Hotel Del Monte. (After World War II, the Hotel del Monte building and surrounding grounds were acquired by the United States Navy to its Naval Postgraduate School and the building was renamed Herrmann Hall.) Golf Course Histories has an aerial comparison of the changes to the course, notably the 17th hole, from 1938 to 2014.\n\nThe course was bought by a consortium of Japanese investors during the upswing of foreign investments in American properties in the early 1990s. The sale, however, generated controversy when it was discovered that one of the investors had alleged ties to organized crime in Japan. It was then bought by another group of Japanese investors before being sold to the Pebble Beach Co. several years later.\n\nThe first professional tournament at Pebble Beach was the Monterey Peninsula Open in 1926, which had a $5,000 purse. \"Lighthorse\" Harry Cooper of Texas won with a 72-hole score of 293 (+5). In 1929, Pebble hosted its first major—the U.S. Amateur. A match play event, it was won by Jimmy Johnston of Minnesota, while Bobby Jones tied for medalist honors in the stroke play qualifier, but lost his first-round match to Johnny Goodman.\n\nIn 1947, Pebble Beach began its run as one of the host courses for the Bing Crosby National Pro-Am tournament, sometimes known as the \"Clam Bake\", and now the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. The tournament is held annually, usually in February, and is an unusual four-round tournament. The final round on Sunday is played at Pebble Beach, but the first three rounds of pro-am play are contested in round-robin format at Pebble Beach and two other courses—currently Spyglass Hill Golf Course and Monterey Peninsula Country Club, Shores Course. In August or September, the course also hosts the Champions Tour's First Tee Open with the Poppy Hills Golf Course.\n\nPebble Beach has hosted the U.S. Open six times, first in 1972, and most recently in 2019. It has an exceptionally distinguished set of champions including Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Tom Kite, Tiger Woods, Graeme McDowell and Gary Woodland. Pebble Beach was also the site of the PGA Championship in 1977, won by Lanny Wadkins in a sudden-death playoff over Gene Littler, the first use of the format in a major championship.\n\nMany other high-profile championships have been staged on the course, including several U.S. Amateur Championships; Nicklaus won his second title in the event here in 1961. Eleven years later in 1972, he won Pebble Beach's first U.S. Open.\n\nIn 2023, Pebble Beach will be the first course to host a men's, women's, and senior men's golf tournament in the same calendar year, as the course will host the U.S. Women's Open.\n\nIn laying out the course, Jack Neville attempted to bring as many holes to the rocky coastline as possible. The first two holes are inland, the third runs toward the ocean, and the fourth and fifth holes run along the Stillwater Cove. This arrangement allowed Neville to make use of a peninsula which juts straight out into the Pacific Ocean. Prior to 1998, the fifth hole was an uphill par 3, but after the Pebble Beach Company acquired additional ocean front property, Jack Nicklaus designed a revised hole that sits hard by Stillwater Cove. The sixth, seventh and tee shot of the eighth holes are situated on Arrowhead Point. The second shot of the eighth hole and the ninth and tenth holes are situated above Carmel Bay.\n\nThe course then runs inland from the eleventh to the sixteenth holes. The Par 5 fourteenth hole has usually been one of the toughest holes on the PGA Tour. The 16th hole runs alongside the 3rd hole to complete the figure eight, and bring the dramatic closing holes along Stillwater Cove. These include the long par 3 17th, whose place in golf history was assured when Jack Nicklaus (1972) and Tom Watson (1982) made key shots there to win U.S. Opens.\n\nThe short par 3 7th, which plays to just over 100 yards even during major championships, is one of the most photographed holes in the world. From an elevated tee, players hit straight out toward the Pacific Ocean off Arrowhead Point, with nothing in the background but the often violent Pacific Ocean surf crashing against rocky outcroppings.\n\nThe long par 4 8th runs alongside the 6th hole leaving the peninsula and heading back toward the coastline. On this dogleg right, the ocean is a constant companion along the entire right side. The landing area is extremely generous in width, but a long straight drive could leave the fairway and enter an inlet of the sea. Because the landing area is elevated on a cliff above the green, players have a good view of the small landing target a mid to long iron away. Jack Nicklaus has called this his favorite approach shot in all of golf.\n\nThe par 3 17th is situated on a smaller peninsula to the west of the one that holds the 6-8th holes. Although there is an ocean view and the sea runs along the left side, the primary challenge of the 17th is its length (playing 180-210 yards during championships) and its unusual shaped green. The green is long and thin, tilted about 45 degrees from the angle of the golfer on the tee. Depending upon pin position and wind, a golfer may use a great variety of clubs for the tee shot and, although the green is large in area, the landing area for any approach is relatively small. A large sand trap guards the front and left.\n\nThe 18th hole is a medium length par 5 (about 550 yards) with Pacific Ocean all along the left. What may be the greatest closing hole in golf was originally an unremarkable par 4. In 1922, William Herbert Fowler added almost 200 yards to the hole. This unique hole also features a tree in the middle of the fairway and a long 100+ yard bunker running along the ocean from the green, guarding the left side.\n\nIn addition to the lengthening of the 18th, the other most significant change in the course's layout came in 1998. Early in the course's history, a parcel of land along the ocean was sold off, forcing the 5th to run inland to where the tee of #6 now stands. As early as a year after that parcel was sold, the course tried to buy back the land, but was unsuccessful until 1995. Jack Nicklaus designed a new par 3 on that land. Although it forces a long walk from the 5th green to the 6th tee, the course finally uses as much ocean real estate as possible, which was Neville's original vision. Recent changes done in 2008 were to holes 3, 6, 9, 10, and 12, which changed the dynamics of play with new bunkers located on each fairway. These additions were integrated for the 2010 U.S. Open, which also modified the 2nd hole to a par 4, which reduced the course to a par 71 for the championship, which was lengthened to 7040 yards (6437 m).\n\nPebble Beach has hosted the U.S. Open six times: 1972, 1982, 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2019 and is scheduled a seventh time in 2027.\n\nThe U.S. Open was first held at Pebble Beach in 1972, won by Jack Nicklaus, who captured his 11th major title (of an eventual 18) as a professional. It was a historically important win, as Nicklaus tied Bobby Jones with 13 major titles; a lifelong amateur, Jones' major titles were in the U.S. Open, British Open, U.S. Amateur, and British Amateur. Nicklaus won the U.S. Amateur twice, in 1959 (Broadmoor, Colorado) and 1961 (Pebble Beach).\n\nNicklaus secured the victory in 1972 with one of the most famous golf shots of all time. He arrived at the 17th tee facing deteriorating weather and a brisk wind on the challenging par-3 hole. Nicklaus hit a 1-iron that bounced once and struck the flagstick; it came to rest next to the cup for a tap-in birdie.\n\nTwo months earlier, Nicklaus had won the Masters to become the first in a dozen years (Arnold Palmer in 1960) to win golf's first two major titles of the season. At the British Open in July, Nicklaus shot a final round 66 to finish second, one stroke behind Lee Trevino, ending his Grand Slam run in 1972. (Palmer also missed a third straight major by a stroke at the 1960 British Open.) Through 2017, only one golfer has won the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open in the same calendar year: Ben Hogan in 1953.\n\nNicklaus also won the Crosby events on either side of this Open, in 1972 and 1973, and previously in 1967.\n\nNicklaus was also a key player in 1982 at Pebble Beach. On the front nine on Sunday, Nicklaus made five straight birdies on holes 3 thru 7 and finished ahead of the last group tied for the lead. As was the case in 1972, the 17th hole was again the site of one golf's most memorable shots. In the last group, future Hall Of Famer Tom Watson hit his tee shot on the par-3 17th just a few feet off the green, into heavy rough which had been grown very tall and thick, typical of USGA Open playing conditions. His succeeding pitch was from above the hole; he needed to strike the ball firmly to get the ball out of the rough, but such an aggressive attack would likely leave a long comeback putt to save par. In a live television interview immediately after Watson's errant tee shot, and given the difficulty of Watson's upcoming pitch shot Nicklaus appeared confident that he would soon be in the outright lead.\n\nWatson was apparently equally confident. He and his caddy Bruce Edwards strategized on the shot, and Edwards encouraged him to get the ball close. Watson replied, \"Close, hell, I'm going to sink it.\" The pitch came out perfectly, landed softly and rolled into the cup. Watson ran onto the green jubilantly and gestured back at Edwards saying \"I told you so\". He then birdied the challenging par-5 18th hole for a two-shot victory margin in his only U.S. Open win. Watson had previously won twice at Pebble Beach, in the Crosby events of 1977 and 1978.\n\nDuring the following winter, a storm eroded portions of the 17th green and 18th tee box into the Pacific Ocean. Though rebuilt, the exact spot where Watson struck his historic chip shot no longer exists.\n\nThe 1992 championship was one of the most difficult ever played at Pebble Beach, with clear skies and brisk winds on the weekend. Only two players finished under par: champion Tom Kite at 285 (-3) and runner-up Jeff Sluman at 287 (-1). Gil Morgan was 12 under par early in the third round, but later fell back. Kite was one of the best players on tour in the 1980s, with 19 top tens in majors prior to 1992. Perhaps the best player of his era without a major, he finally won at Pebble Beach at age 42.\n\nThis championship was also notable as the last par-72 course in the U.S. Open, with no converted par 5's, until 2017, when Erin Hills, which was built in 1998, played as a par-72.\n\nPerhaps looking for a special place to host in 2000, the USGA decided that Pebble Beach should host the first U.S. Open of the millennium. In some respects the Open was even tougher than the 1992 contest, with only one player finishing under par - champion Tiger Woods. Woods scored 65-69-71-67 to tie a U.S. Open record with 272, and set a U.S. Open record by finishing 12 under par, 15 shots ahead of the runners-up, the largest margin of victory ever in a major championship.\n\nThe third major of Woods' career, it was the start of his non-calendar year Grand Slam; he won the following three majors for four in a row.\n\nGraeme McDowell won in 2010 by one stroke over Grégory Havret. Ernie Els finished third, with Woods and Phil Mickelson in a tie for fourth. McDowell, from Northern Ireland, became the first European to win the U.S. Open in forty years. In his last U.S. Open, 1982 champion Watson at age 60 became the second-oldest player to make a U.S. Open cut (after Sam Snead, age 61 in 1973), and finished tied for 29th.\n\nGary Woodland won in 2019 by three strokes over Brooks Koepka. Woodland prevented Koepka from becoming the first golfer in over 100 years to win three consecutive U.S. Opens. In his final amateur tournament, Viktor Hovland finished tied for 12th. With a 4-under total of 280, Hovland broke Jack Nicklaus' U.S. Open scoring total for an amateur. Nicklaus shot 282 over four rounds at Cherry Hills Country Club in 1960.\n\n\nThere has been continuing controversy between recreational interests and environmental protection, related to a proposed new golf course development by the Pebble Beach Company. The new golf course proposal has existed in some form since the early 1990s; while the environmental protection issues center on the potential damage to rare and endangered species in this locale. The Pebble Beach Company agreed to leave 635 acres of forest area on the Pebble Beach property undeveloped.\n\n"}
{"id": "2206447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206447", "title": "Twitch (Ministry album)", "text": "Twitch (Ministry album)\n\nTwitch is the second studio album by American rock band Ministry, released on March 12, 1986 by Sire Records. Recorded mostly in London and West Berlin during 1985, it was produced by the band's frontman Al Jourgensen and On-U Sound Records owner Adrian Sherwood. It stepped away from the synthpop-oriented form of their debut studio album \"With Sympathy\" (1983) and moved toward a darker, more aggressive sound, heavily influenced by industrial dance groups Cabaret Voltaire and Front 242.\n\nPreceded by \"Over the Shoulder\", with an accompanying video directed by Peter Christopherson, the album was supported by a concert tour of North America, which was the first to feature Paul Barker and Bill Rieflin in the line-up, playing bass guitar and drums, respectively. The album was released to mixed reviews.\n\nShortly after touring in support of Ministry's 1983 debut album, \"With Sympathy\", Al Jourgensen and bandmates moved to Evanston, Illinois, and proceeded to record what was to be Ministry's second album with Arista Records. Amid differences on the upcoming recording's style, the band left Arista in Spring 1984, following a legal dispute, and returned to Wax Trax! Records, their original label. In that year's Autumn, Ministry embarked on the tour of the East Coast with Belgian industrial dance band Front 242 as a supporting act; according to various accounts, Jourgensen began working on new music either during that tour or the same time \"With Sympathy\" was recorded. In his 2013 autobiography, \"Ministry: The Lost Gospels...\", Jourgensen said that, during an aforementioned tour, Seymour Stein had attended several gigs trying to offer the band a new deal with his record label Sire Records, a Warner Bros. Records subsidiary. As various accounts state, Jourgensen declined an offer, recalling his experience with Arista, but eventually volunteered, setting conditions that Sire would give Jourgensen complete creative control over his work, and would give resources to buy a Fairlight CMI synthesizer, and also to support the Wax Trax! imprint; as Jourgensen put it in 2013, \"it was kind of a personal sacrifice to keep that company rolling and allow them to keep signing bands.\" By Summer 1985, Ministry released several non-album singles on Wax Trax!: “All Day”, “(Every Day Is) Halloween”, and “The Nature of Love”, before getting signed to Sire. By this point, Jourgensen remained the only official member of Ministry.\n\nStein subsequently employed On-U Sound Records owner Adrian Sherwood as the record's principal producer, regarding his work with Depeche Mode on their 1984 singles \"People Are People\" and \"Master and Servant\". Jourgensen, Sherwood, and Keith LeBlanc began work in Chicago in Spring 1985, before relocating in London-based Southern Studios; the later sessions were held in West Berlin at Hansa Tonstudio. Recalling sessions in \"The Lost Gospels...\", Jourgensen mostly regarded Sherwood for production advice, though he expressed dislike about his experience in London, citing cultural differences and conflicts with Sherwood's friends; also he admitted that can't \"feel like this one's really mine because it's so Adrian Sherwood-influenced.\"\nMusically, \"Twitch\" is more abrasive and beat-driven than preceding Ministry releases, stepping away from the pop-oriented sound of \"With Sympathy\", and incorporating elements from the growing industrial scene of the mid-1980s instead. Various authors wrote that the album's overall sound is at times reminiscent of Ministry's contemporary acts in Europe, Cabaret Voltaire and Front 242. It is described as an electronica, industrial, and EBM/industrial dance record which also contains material ascribed to the two latter genres, as well as dance-pop, dub, eurodisco, noise rock and synthpop. Jourgensen's English-accented singing, while carried over from \"With Sympathy\", was approached with distortion effects. \"Twitch\" was also the first Ministry record featuring use of sampling, which became one of Ministry's trademarks over the years. The production also features the use of white noise and distortion.\n\nThe opening track, \"Just Like You\", is cited by Jourgensen as his “first real political Ministry song”. “We Believe” is described as a \"sequencer hammerlock\" and has been compared to the music of Nine Inch Nails. \"All Day Remix\" is a re-worked version of \"All Day\", originally the A-side from Wax Trax!'s 1985 single which included “Halloween”; drummer Stephen George and bassist Brad Hallen, who quit the band after 1984, were still credited for their contribution to the original track. \"The Angel\" features backing vocals from Jourgensen's then-wife Patty; though uncredited, their daughter Adrienne appears as a toddler in this track's intro.\n\nThe sole single from \"Twitch\", \"Over the Shoulder\", was released in late November 1985, and marked Ministry's debut on Sire. The song is cited as an early example of electro-industrial, and contains multiple layers of looped synthesizer parts along with distinctive heavy drum machine pattern along with Jourgensen's weak vocal appoarch, referred to by \"Billboard\" editors \"as mannered as Scritti Politti heard over the telephone.\" In the same magazine's \"Dance Trax\" column, writer Brian Chin described it as “a Bee Gees satire.” In a later review published in the March 1986 issue of \"Spin Magazine\", columnist John Leland praised Sherwood's work with Ministry's \"typically banal ideas.\"\n\nThe music video for \"Over the Shoulder\" was directed by Peter Christopherson. According to Jourgensen, the director hired two kids to steal a car, then filmed it. When the band asked to film in a store, the owner refused. The director allegedly paid the same kids to break into the store and trash it, and the band asked once again. The owner, needing money to pay for cleanup, agreed. Jourgensen said, \"Everything that happened on that video was criminal.\"\n\nIn 2000, the video of \"Over the Shoulder\" was featured on compilation album \"Tapes of Wrath\"; the song was to be featured on a 2001 compilation album \"Greatest Fits\", but was left off due to medium limitations.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Twitch\" the band commenced a four-month tour through the US and Canada with a new four-piece line-up; Jourgensen approached former members of the Blackouts—Roland Barker, his brother Paul Barker and Bill Rieflin—to join the band. Both Barkers performed keyboards and bass, respectively; Rieflin joined on drums. Dave “Rave” Ogilvie, then producer of Canadian electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy, joined them as a sound engineer, while Frank Nardiello—future Thrill Kill Kult singer Groovie Mann—was a lighting technician.\n\n\"Twitch\" was released on March 12, 1986 by Sire and Warner Bros. Records. Shortly after, it entered \"Billboard\" 200 on April 4 for three weeks, peaking at No. 194. A new issue of the album was released on March 13, 1990, featuring tracks from the \"Over the Shoulder\" single. As of February 2007, the album sold 138,755 copies in the United States.\n\n\"Twitched\", an unauthorized 2003 release by Radioactive Records, is an allegedly alternate version of \"Twitch\", featuring the track listing that the band is said to have intended it to have before the intervention of the record company. It includes previously unreleased alternative versions of tracks from the album.\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau has described \"Twitch\" as \"fleetingly gothic, marginally industrial, unrelenting in a vaguely threatening way, they shout \"The world is ending\" on a crowded dancefloor.\" Ira Robbins of \"Trouser Press\" called the record as \"the first steps into a murky swamp that subsumes Jourgensen's distorted, nearly spoken vocals within a pounding electronic rhythm onslaught,\" while stating: \"Although much of this unsuccessful experiment throbs along dully, with haphazard intersections of good new ideas and bad old ideas, the militaristic \"All Day Remix\" offers a cogent demonstration of the direction Jourgensen is headed.\" In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Alan Escher has stated that \"this sounds nothing like any of Ministry's other albums; listeners may hear how they became what they did.\" Escher also noted: \"It's interesting though repetitive at times (\"Crash and Burn\"), and if you care to listen to Jourgensen's rants, he really does have something to say.\" \n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Twitch\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2206448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206448", "title": "List of West Indies cricket captains", "text": "List of West Indies cricket captains\n\nThis is a list of all men, boys and women who have captained the West Indian cricket team at official international level in at least one match. The West Indies became a full member of the Imperial Cricket Conference (now the International Cricket Council) on 31 May 1926 at the same time as India and New Zealand. It played its first test match in 1928 against England at Lord's. Their first game against other opposition came in 1930/31 when they played Australia.\n\nIn the mid-1980s there were two rebel West Indian tours to South Africa, which was at that time banned from official competition because of the apartheid régime then in force there. None of the matches from the rebel tours were recognised as official Test matches and all players who toured South Africa at the time were banned from official international cricket matches for life. The captains of those West Indian sides are also listed below.\n\nPrior to becoming a member of the ICC, the first combined West Indian team was formed in 1884 and toured Canada and the United States in 1886 under the captaincies of Charles Guy Austin Wyatt of Demerara and Laurence Fyfe of Jamaica (also vice captain under Wyatt). In a return tour by the United States in 1888, the combined West Indian team was captained by Edward Wright. Combined West Indian teams have played more regular first-class cricket under the name “West Indies” since 1897 usually against amateur sides touring from England, such as Lord Brackley’s XI or RA Bennett’s XI, but from 1912 onwards the MCC also played on tour against the West Indies. The West Indies also toured England in 1900, 1906 and 1923 with the opposition usually being various English first-class and minor county sides. Other opposition during these tours included amateur sides, the MCC, an England XI (once) and Scotland and Ireland (once each). Some of the matches played on the various West Indian tours of England were deemed not to be first-class matches. During this time (1897 to 1926) the various West Indies captains were Aucher Warner, Stanley Sproston (non-first-class matches only), Harold Austin, Clement King, Alfred Harrigan, Edwin Moulder, William Sherlock, Percy Tarilton, Malcolm Austin and Karl Nunes\n\nThis is a list of cricketers who have captained the West Indian cricket team for at least one Test match. Development of the Test captaincy of West Indies falls into three eras –\nThe table of results is complete up to the only Test match for the West Indies in the 2019-20 West Indian tour against Afghanistan. Where a player has a dagger (†) next to a Test match series in which he captained at least one Test, that denotes that player deputised for the appointed captain or were appointed for a minor proportion in a series.\n\nNotes:\n\nThis is a complete list of every man who has captained the West Indies in at least one One Day International. It is complete up to the third and final match for the West Indies in the 2019-20 West Indian tour of Sri Lanka.\n\nThis is a complete list of every man who has captained the West Indies in at least one twenty20 international. It is complete up to the second and final T20I match for the West Indies in the 2019-20 West Indian tour of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe first Twenty20 International involving West Indies was played in February 2006 against New Zealand in Auckland. This match was the first tied Twenty20 International and also involved the first bowl-out (won by New Zealand).\n\nTwo years later in December 2008, another match between New Zealand and West Indies at the same venue in Auckland was also tied and this match involved the first elimination over/Super Over (won by West Indies) which is meant to replace the bowl-out.\n\nThe first Twenty20 International played in the West Indies was played on 20 June 2008 against Australia in Bridgetown, Barbados.\n\nIn addition to the above official Tests and ODIs, there have been West Indian captains of other leading sides. The Rest of the World teams that played in England and Australia in 1970 and 1971/2 respectively were captained by a West Indian. World Series Cricket featured a West Indian side, and finally, there were two rebel West Indian tours to apartheid South Africa.\n\nWhen the South African tour to England due to take place in 1970 was cancelled, five matches were arranged against a Rest of the World team, all of which were recognised as Tests at the time, although they were later stripped of Test status. A similar situation also arose with the proposed South African tour of Australia that was due to take place in 1971/2, when the Rest of the World team also played two one-day matches. (There were to be three games, but one was abandoned without a ball being bowled.) These matches do not have official ODI status. The Rest of the World team was captained by a West Indian, Garfield Sobers.\n\nIn 1977/8 Kerry Packer financed a breakaway cricket movement by signing up top players from Australia, the West Indies and other cricket nations around the world. Three sides were constructed: an Australian team, a West Indian team and a World team, with the World teams including some West Indians too. The teams played a mixture of unofficial Test matches, styled as Supertests, and unofficial ODIs. Unlike the Australian players, who were barred from playing official cricket until the rift was healed after the 1978/9 season, the West Indian players were permitted to play official cricket as well as compete in World Series Cricket.\n\nIn 1982/3 and 1983/4 a group of West Indian cricketers toured apartheid South Africa. The West Indies Cricket Board banned all the tourists from cricket for life, and such was the furore caused by the visits that many of the cricketers ceased to be welcome in their home islands. The rebel West Indian squad played a series of Tests and ODIs, none of which have official status.\n\nThis is a list of cricketers who have captained the West Indian women's cricket team for at least one women's Test match. The table of results is complete to the Test against Pakistan in 2003/4.\n\nThis is a list of cricketers who have captained the West Indian women's cricket team for at least one women's one-day international. The table of results is complete to the third and final match for the team in the 2019-20 India women's tour of West Indies (all three matches of which count as part of the 2017-2020 ICC Women's Championship).\n\nThis is a complete list of every woman who has captained the West Indies in at least one twenty20 international. It is complete up to the fourth and final match for the team in the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. In 2010 West Indies women took their first international T20 title by winning the 2010 ICC Women's Cricket Challenge. The first Twenty20 International involving West Indies women was played in June 2008 against Ireland in Dublin.\nNotes:\n\nThis is a list of cricketers who have captained the West Indian U-19 cricket team for at least one under-19 Test match. The table of results is complete to the only youth Test match of the 2011 Dubai Series between the West Indies U-19 team and the Australia U-19 team and includes the third Test against England in 2001.\n\nThis is a list of cricketers who have captained the West Indian U-19 cricket team for at least one U-19 One Day International. The table of results is complete to the sixth and final youth ODI match for the WI U-19 team in the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, and includes all six youth ODI match for the WI U-19 team in the 2019 Under-19 Tri-Nation Tournament in the West Indies, all six youth ODI matches for the WI U-19 team in 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, all three youth ODI match for the WI U-19 team in the 2017 West Indies Under-19 tour of Zimbabwe, all five matches for the WI U-19 team in the 2017 West Indies Under-19 tour of South Africa, all six matches for the WI U-19 team of the 2016 U-19 Cricket World Cup, all three matches for the WI U-19 team of 2015/2016 West Indies U-19 tour of Bangladesh, all six matches for the WI U-19 team of the 2014 U-19 Cricket World Cup, the one and only youth ODI match of the 2013/2014 West Indies U-19 tour of Bangladesh (the other six matches were cancelled following an explosion near the WI U-19 team hotel), all seven youth ODI matches of the 2013/2014 Bangladesh U-19 tour of the West Indies, the 2012 U-19 Cricket World Cup (all six matches including the fifth place playoff), all seven youth ODI matches for the West Indies U-19 team in the 2011/12 U-19 Quadrangular Series in India, all three youth ODI matches of the 2011 Dubai Series between the West Indies U-19 team and the Australia U-19 team and all six matches of the West Indies team in the 2009/10 U-19 Cricket World Cup where they lost in the semi-finals to the Pakistan U-19 cricket team but beat the Sri Lanka U-19 cricket team in the playoff to place third in the tournament. West Indies U-19s' best result in an U-19 World Cup has been as champions in 2016. Previously they were a finalist in 2003/04 and 2007/08 they won the plate final for the U-19 World Cup.\n\nThe West Indian team's greatest successes in One Day Internationals came in 1975 and 1979, when they won the Cricket World Cup under the captaincy of Clive Lloyd, and in 2004 when they won the ICC Champions Trophy under the captaincy of Brian Lara. The West Indies’ most successful captains in Test cricket are Viv Richards (who has won 27 of his 50 Tests), Clive Lloyd (who won 36 of his 74 Tests), Frank Worrell (who won 9 of his 15 Tests) and Richie Richardson (who won 11 of his 24 Tests). In one-day internationals the West Indies’ most successful captain is Clive Lloyd, who won 64 of his 84 matches. The successes of the senior men's team in international tournaments was never replicated at the youth level until the 2016 U-19 Cricket World Cup when Shimron Hetmyer lead the West Indies Under-19 team to their first ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup title. For the most recent international format of cricket, Twenty20 Internationals, the West Indies' best result in an international tournament was achieved in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC World Twenty20 where the team won the ICC World Twenty20 under the captaincy of Darren Sammy. Stafanie Taylor led the West Indies' women's team to their best result in an international Twenty20 tournament when the team won the 2016 ICC Women's World Twenty20. Prior to that Merissa Aguilleira led West Indies women to the semi-finals in the 2010 ICC Women's World Twenty20, the 2012 ICC Women's World Twenty20 and the 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20 and also led the women to their first title in an international Women's Twenty20 tournament during the 2010 ICC Women's Cricket Challenge. Both the West Indies' men's and women's teams made it to the semi-finals of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC Women's World Twenty20 under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Merissa Aguilleira respectively; the third time the men's and women's teams from the same country have done this in the ICC World Twenty20 after Australia's men and women's teams achieved the feat in 2010 and 2012. This feat was repeated for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20 when the West Indies' men's and women's teams made it to the semi-finals again under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Merissa Aguillera. This was bettered in 2016 when both the West Indies' men's and women's teams not only made it to the semi-finals but won the tournaments for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC Women's World Twenty20 under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Stafanie Taylor. Along with men and women's teams from New Zealand (in 2016), England (2016), South Africa (2014), and Australia (2012 and 2010) who also made it the semi-finals in the previous tournaments, this was the eighth time men's and women's teams from the same country have reached the semi-finals in the same year of the ICC World Twenty20. It was also only the second time (after Australia in 2010) that men's and women's teams from the same country have reached the final in the same year of the ICC's premier Twenty20 tournaments. Merissa Aguilleira also led the West Indies women to its best result in Women's ODI cricket when the team finished second in the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup (bettering their previous best finish in the Women's World Cup of fifth place in 2005). Their previous best result had been under Stephanie Power when she led the West Indies to second place in the 2003 IWCC Trophy. Aguilleira is also the most successful West Indies women’s captain in one-day internationals, winning 32 of 55 matches. The only women’s captain who has led her side to a victory in a women's Test match is Louise Browne in the 1976/77 Test series against India.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his interest in zoology, science and for his books on these topics, which are controversial to Haredi Jews.\n\nSlifkin was born and raised in Manchester, United Kingdom, where he studied at a local yeshiva. He left in 1995 to continue his studies in the Medrash Shmuel yeshiva and Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem, Israel. He was ordained at Ohr Somayach Institutions, where he taught Talmud and contemporary Judaism. He now lives with his family in Ramat Beit Shemesh, where he runs the Biblical Museum of Natural History. Slifkin has a master's degree in Judaic Studies from the Lander Institute in Jerusalem and a doctorate in Jewish History from Bar-Ilan University, completed in 2016. His dissertation was entitled: \"Rabbinic and Maskilic Encounters with Zoology in the Nineteenth Century\".\n\nSlifkin explores traditional rabbinic perspectives in his books and discusses how they may relate to issues of interest to modern science. Slifkin is the author of numerous books dealing with the intersectionality of Torah, science and zoology.\n\nIn Slifkin's approach to the reconciliation of Genesis and modern scientific theory, traditional Judaism mandates neither a literalistic approach to Biblical cosmology, nor a belief that the Talmud is always correct about scientific matters. Views similar to these were accepted by some as within the realm of Orthodox Judaism. A public debate triggered by Slifkin's books began regarding how literally Orthodox Judaism interprets the Torah and how much weight should be given to the scientific discussions of rabbinic sages.\n\nSlifkin's books, which had \"cautious references to evolutionary theory\", led to a denunciation of his work by ultra-Orthodox authorities.\n\nThe rabbis object to the tone of Slifkin's work, stating that \"even what is not heretical is expressed in a way only a heretic would speak.\" \n\nThe ban sparked a debate, largely on the Internet, which led to Slifkin's publisher, Targum Press discontinuing distribution of his books. Yashar Books, a smaller Jewish publisher, agreed to distribute them. \n\nMoment magazine quoted an anonymous rabbi who said: “The Slifkin ban is a huge break. It’s a kind of power struggle, and those who didn’t sign the ban are outraged right now. I’m talking about rabbis with long white beards who are furious about it...He’s saying out loud what a lot of people have been talking about quietly all along. To those people, he’s a kind of figurehead.\" \n\nRabbi Aharon Feldman and Rabbi Shlomo Miller wrote articles in defense of the ban, and Rabbi Moshe Meiselman gave three lectures on this topic at Toras Moshe, although Rabbi Feldman grants that, even in the opinion of Rabbi Eliashiv, Slifkin \"cannot be called a heretic\" even though parts of the books are, in their view, heretical, because \"he did follow, at least, a minority opinion.\" These defenses of the ban were themselves controversial, and Rabbi Slifkin posted them all on his website, together with rebuttals written by various people. Rabbi Meiselman requested that Rabbi Slifkin remove the lectures from his website, a request to which Slifkin did not acquiesce. In 2013, Rabbi Meiselman released a nearly 900 page book entitled \"Torah, Chazal, and Science\", which he stated \"was in response to some recent controversies surrounding issues of Torah and science. A spate of books... have attempted to introduce a radical new theology and proclaim it compatible with classic Jewish belief.\" Chaim Malinowitz broke with his Haredi colleagues in not seeking a ban on Slifkin's books.\n\nOn 5 October 2008 Slifkin published an essay entitled \"In Defense of My Opponents\" in which he acknowledges that there is a reasonable basis for a ban on his books in certain communities.\n\nSlifkin is the author of numerous books on Torah, zoology and cryptozoology:\n\n\nSlifkin has a website called \"Zoo Torah\" and writes a blog called \"Rationalist Judaism,\" in which he promulgates his opinions on Jewish thought. He has also published e-books on many of his topics of interest.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 21, 1991. In the episode, Grampa confesses that Homer has a half-brother named Herbert Powell, a car manufacturer. Herb permits Homer to design his company's new car, which is an overpriced monstrosity that bankrupts him.\n\nThe episode was written by Jeff Martin and directed by Wes Archer. American actor Danny DeVito provided the voice of Herb. The episode features cultural references to cars such as the Edsel, the Tucker Torpedo, the Ford Mustang, and the Lamborghini Cheetah. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15.4, and was the highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. Some fans were upset with the sad ending of the episode, so the producers decided to write a sequel, \"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\", in which Herb regains his fortune and forgives Homer.\n\nAfter watching the latest McBain film, Grampa suffers a mild heart attack while arguing with a cinema clerk. Thinking he might die, he confesses a long-hidden secret: Homer has a half-brother. Before Grampa married Homer's mother, he and a carnival prostitute\nhad a son whom they left at the Shelbyville Orphanage. Determined to find his brother, Homer visits the orphanage and learns that Grampa's love child, named Herbert, was adopted by a Mr. and Mrs. Powell.\n\nHerbert \"Herb\" Powell — who looks like Homer except he is taller, slimmer and has more hair — owns Powell Motors, a Detroit automobile manufacturer. Herb is overjoyed to learn Homer is his half-brother and invites the Simpsons to stay at his mansion. Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are enthralled by Herb's wealthy lifestyle and kind personality, but Marge worries wealth will spoil her children. After Herb decides that Homer, an average American, is the perfect person to design his company's new car, he gives him free rein to design it. When Herb's design team ignores Homer's outlandish suggestions, Herb encourages Homer to take command of the project and incorporate his own ideas in the final design.\n\nWhen the new car is unveiled with great fanfare, Herb is horrified to find it is a badly designed monstrosity that costs US$82,000, forcing Powell Motors into bankruptcy. The bank forecloses on Herb's mansion and he loses everything he worked for. As Herb leaves Detroit on a bus, he angrily tells Homer that he would have been better off not knowing him. Angry, Homer disavows his half-brother.\n\nWhile Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees Herb's life was better before he discovered he was a Simpson. Grampa arrives and scolds Homer for ruining Herb's life. While Homer drives the family home, Bart tells him his car is great. Homer is relieved to learn at least one person likes it.\n\n\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\" was written by Jeff Martin and directed by Wes Archer. Both Homer's mother and Herb Powell make their first appearances on \"The Simpsons\" in the episode. Some fans were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result the producers decided to write a sequel in which Herb would be given a kinder fate. The resulting episode, \"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\", aired at the end of the third season. In that episode, Herb briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb US$2000, which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. He then bought each member of the family gifts and paid Homer back with a vibrating chair, along with his forgiveness.\n\nThe episode was recorded on August 13, 1990. The voice of Herb was provided by guest star Danny DeVito, an American actor who was suggested for the role by \"Simpsons\" executive producer Sam Simon. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, writes in her autobiography \"My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy\" that DeVito had to record his lines quickly because he had another appointment, so the staff focused on recording only his scenes instead of the whole episode at once. Cartwright was a fan of DeVito's and recalls: \"This morning, at the table read, I had just filled my plate with assorted fruits when Bonnie said to my backside, 'Nancy, I want to introduce you to...' and I turned and practically knocked over Danny DeVito, all four feet, eleven inches of him. How embarrassing!\" While recording the scenes, Cartwright stood directly across the room from DeVito, which she appreciated since she got to see him in action. She thought DeVito \"threw his body and soul\" into his performance. While the recording took part, animation director Archer scribbled down some of DeVito's attitudes, gestures, and facial expressions on a piece of paper as he performed. In one scene of the episode, Herb tells Homer and the rest of the Simpson family to \"[make] yourselves at home. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room...\" Cartwright said of it:\n\nThe storyline of a controversially styled car causing the company to fail echoes that of the Edsel, the Tucker 48, and the later DeLorean. The Edsel was a controversially styled car named after Henry Ford's son, Edsel, which is now considered one of the biggest car flops in history, while production of the Tucker Torpedo, which introduced many new features, was shut down amidst scandal and accusations of stock fraud in 1949. Homer wants the horns of the car he is designing to play the traditional Spanish folk corrido \"La Cucaracha\". The Pope is in the audience for the unveiling of Homer's new car. Herb berates his staff for suggesting that the company name a new car \"Persephone\" after the Greek goddess of fertility in Greek mythology, telling them \"People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads! They want names like 'Mustang' and 'Cheetah', vicious animal names,\" referencing the Ford Mustang and Lamborghini Cheetah cars.\n\nThe title of the episode is a reference the name of the fictional book \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" in the 1941 film \"Sullivan's Travels\". Herb lives in a house that looks like American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's house in Oak Park, Illinois, works in a studio that looks like the Taliesin school of architecture in Spring Green, Wisconsin, and his factory resembles the Johnson Wax Headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin, all three buildings designed by Wright.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\" finished twenty-sixth in the ratings for the week of February 18–24, 1991. With a Nielsen rating of 15.4, equivalent to approximately 14.1 million viewing households, it was the highest-rated show on Fox that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. \n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that although it is \"inevitable\" that Homer's car will be a disaster, the \"joy of this episode is anticipating exactly what sort of disaster\". \n\nA member of the IGN staff wrote in a season two review that \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\" is one of the \"real winners to be found in the second season\". \n\nDawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the most memorable line of the episode was Homer's idea of the perfect car, \"You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car! And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style — like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!\"\n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called the episode a solid episode and said that the introduction of Homer's brother \"could have been gimmicky, especially with a big-name guest star like DeVito, but the concept fared nicely\". Jacobson added that he thought DeVito \"brought spark to his part and made Herb fun and lively. The parts in which Homer developed his car were also hilarious and offered some of the show's best bits. The program even showed some great little moments, like the hallmark Simpson five o'clock shadow on infant Herb.\" \n\nJeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said the episode \"features another great guest voice, this time by Danny DeVito as the voice of Homer's long lost brother Herb, who reenters Homer's life and solicits his 'common man' prospective in building a car. Once again, Homer's sentimentality comes through.\" \"Total Film\"'s Nathan Ditum ranked DeVito's performance as the 10th best guest appearance in the show's history.\n\nOn June 29, 2013, Porcubimmer Motors debuted a real-life version of \"The Homer,\" the car that was designed by Homer in this episode, at the 24 Hours of LeMons race in Buttonwillow, California.\n\n"}

The mine had been taken over from the North Mount Lyell Company in 1903.\n\nThe fire started on a Saturday morning, between 11:15 and 11:30 am, when the pump house on the 700 ft level of the mine was reported as being on fire. Only 73 men made their way to safety on the first day. Initially the status of the fire, numbers, casualties and survivors were confused in the first day or so. Considerable problems occurred removing men from the mine who were still alive. Many became trapped as they were working in remote stopes and didn't know of the fire until it was far too late, as there was no emergency warning system operating in the mine. Instead, men had to run along the levels and drives calling to the men, warning them of the serious danger that faced them. 170 men entered the mine that day. 42 were never to be seen alive again.\n\nDuring the rescue party's attempts to find any still alive in the stifling depths, they came\nacross a group of men on the 700 ft level. One of these, Joe McCarthy, left a note pinned to a timber with a \"spider\" (a tool the miners used to hold their candles in). \nThe note read:\n\"Seven hundred level. North Lyell mine, 12-10-12. \nIf anyone should find this note convey to my wife.\nDear Agnes. - I will say good-bye. Sure I will not see you again any more.\nI am pleased to have made a little provision for you and poor little Lorna.\nBe good to our little darling.\nMy mate, Len Burke, is done, and poor old V. and Driver too.\nGood-bye, with love to all.\nYour loving husband, Joe McCarthy.\"\nOn Monday 14 October, 1,100 ft of rope was lowered down the main shaft of the mine. Attached to it was a signal gong. It was originally meant for the men working on fixing the skids in the shaft, however, late in the afternoon, watchers heard the rap of the line. It sent the message: \"Pull to surface\". When the rope was pulled up, a handkerchief wrapped around a tobacco tin was attached to it. Inside the tin was a penciled note: \"\"40 men in 40 stope. Send food and candles at once. No time to lose. J. Ryan\"\"\n\nThe rescue attempt involved the transporting of breathing equipment from one of the Victorian mining towns to Queenstown, via a speedy shipping across the Bass Strait and the alleged fastest times by engines on the Emu Bay Railway, the Government Strahan–Zeehan Railway line between Zeehan and Regatta Point, and from there by the abt line to Queenstown.\n\nSuch was their rush to get the rescue gear to the mine, the , the ship which crossed Bass Strait carrying the equipment, made the crossing in 13 hours, 35 minutes - a record which stood for many years. Also the train travelling times between Burnie and Queenstown were never bettered.\n\nAs a result of the fire, initially 42 lives were lost; the bodies were buried in unmarked graves in the Queenstown General cemetery. Initially, the first two bodies to be recovered were buried in the Linda Cemetery, however when the final victim (John Bourke) was recovered, the pair were buried at Queenstown at the same time as Bourke. One of the miners, Albert Gadd, who escaped death and then re-entered the mine to assist in the rescue efforts, was hospitalised in Launceston and died on 20 February 1913 from carbon monoxide poisoning. Gadd, whose wife was delivered of a son two months later, can be regarded as the 43rd victim of the mining tragedy. He was posthumously awarded the Clarke Gold Medal from the Royal Humane Society in Melbourne. Silver medals were awarded to 30 rescuers, among them engineer Russell Mervyn Murray, later the mine's general manager.\n\nThe royal commission that was held at the time of the retrieval of bodies after the fire, and despite various theories as to the cause of the fire, an open verdict remained.\n\nAlthough Blainey covers the details of the disaster in \"The Peaks of Lyell\", writing 40 years after the event, there were still variations upon the \"official\" versions of the event, amongst \"old timers\" in Queenstown. Some of these are aired and detailed in Bradshaw's verbatim record of the newspaper reports and the royal commission, as well as being incorporated into Crawford's recent novel.\n\nA number of themes arise from reading Blainey, and others on the subject: the rise of trade unionism on the west coast at the time, and the lack of preparedness for such disasters by the mining companies. Also one recurring theme in some of the stories was the rumour or suggestion of the presence of a woman disguised as a man working underground.\n\nAt the Centenary of the event at the Queenstown Heritage and Arts Festival Peter Schulze's book \"An Engineer Speaks of Lyell\" elaborates an argument that the most likely cause of the fire was an electrical fault as a result of faulty installation of the pump motor at the 700 ft level. Schulze, who had access to more documents than Blainey and the twin advantages of an electrical engineering background and mining experience, concludes that the Royal Commission process was manipulated to give a result that best suited the Company, for whom an adverse finding could have been financially ruinous. It was especially at fault for naming the suspected arsonist, against whom there was no evidence apart from his prominence as a Union leader. He concedes that following the accident the Company followed best practice in mine management and labour relations.\n\nThis list of victim details is compiled from the following sources:\n\nThe Queenstown Heritage and Arts Festival of 2012 celebrated the centenary of this event. Part of the celebrations included a collection of songs entitled \"Fire Underground\" performed by The West Coast Singers, an ensemble of vocalists organized and directed by Kerrie Maguire. The West Coast Singers toured Tasmania with this concert in the following months, including performances at the Cygnet and Tamar Valley Folk Festivals in January 2013. The tour wrapped up with a performance at the Paragon Theatre, Queenstown in June 2013, on the 100th anniversary of the last funeral of the disaster's victims.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a filarial nematode known to infect the lymph vessels of domestic cats and wild animals, causing a disease filariasis.\n\n\"Brugia pahangi\" have been found in cats in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. A large population of cats, more specifically stray cats, are infected with the parasite. When the nematode was first being studied, a report by Mak et al. (1980) reported that 11% of cats sampled in the Peninsular Malaysia were infected. In Thailand, 25% of the blood samples take from 83 cats residing in Buddhist temples carried the worm (Palmieri et al., 1985).\n\nThe size is approximately 280 μm long by 5–6 μm wide. The cephalic tip is bluntly rounded. The nerve ring (excretory pore) and the nucleus of the excretory cell are said to be similar to \"B. malayi\". Behind the nerve ring it was found that the cells of the nuclear column over time become less dense. The central viscus (Innenkorper) begin around the middle of the body, the body nuclei are scatter which causes trouble in experiments the reason being that it is difficult to stain.\nThere are four rectal cells (\"G\" or \"R\" cells), R is the most prominent of the rectal cells, and it is about four-fifths of the body width. The anal spot is V-shaped.\nThe nucleus is around 3 μm in diameter.\nFemales are about 38 to 63 mm long. This genus of Brugia is most commonly recognized by the spicules in males, which are needle like mating structures that open the vulva of the female worm.\n\nIn the Brugia genus, there are two spicules, they are the shortest in length, the left one being 200–215 μm and the right one 75–90 μm long. Despite the fact that males have certain characteristics that help key this species out, the females lack those key characteristics. However, according to \nIn an experiment done by Knott, 2% of the nematodes he collected had microfilaria that was about 280 μm long.\n\nThe adults and larvae are found in the lymphatic vessels. There are times in which \"B.pahangi\" can be found under the skin and in the corpses of dead cats.\nInfection happens through transmission of a mosquito. When it bites, inoculation of microfilaria is passed through salivary glands \nUsing Knott's technique, researchers can find the infection through the microfilariae in the blood through a direct smear. These numbers can be extreme, sometimes having more than 10,000 microfilariae per millimeter of blood.\n\nTo find if the cat is infected or not, a blood test is taken. To measure the severity of the infection, the number of microfilariae per microliter of blood is tested.\n\nThere are very few experiments, but there was a study in which a \"Wolbachia pipientis\" strain was used to infect \"Aedea aegypti\", Yellow fever mosquito. This shortened the life span of a mosquito, which then reduced the incubation period of \"B. pahangi\". The third larval stage was used. It was seen that the strain did reduce the prevalence in the microfilarial infection. Further experimentation and research can be done with this bacterium to find a way in which to create a preventative.\n"}

Filarial nematodes are the causative agents of filariases, tropical diseases that afflict about 160 million people worldwide. Currently, neither safe and efficient drugs nor vaccines are available to eliminate or prevent these infections, which makes the development of new control strategies a priority.\n\n\"A. viteae\" is an animal parasite. These filarial nematodes and their animal hosts are often used as models for studies on the biology of human infection. It shares considerable antigenic homology with the human filarial worm \"Onchocerca volvulus\"; this allows for rapid analysis of larval development, which is essential to efforts in vaccine development.\n\n\"A. viteae\" is one of the few filaroids that do not bear \"Wolbachia\" bacteria. Infection with \"Wolbachia\" is essential to the continued good health and reproduction of their nematode hosts. Molecular studies suggest that \"A. viteae\" either lost its symbionts before they became essential or diverged from other filaroids before \"Wolbachia\" acquisition. More recent research found \"Wolbachia\"-like sequences in the genomes of \"A. viteae\", some of which were transcribed in developing embryos and testes of the nematode, which suggested horizontal transfer of genetic material from an ancestral bacterial endosymbiont. \n"}

{"id": "2206496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206496", "title": "Ionomer", "text": "Ionomer\n\nAn ionomer () (\"iono-\" + \"-mer\") is a polymer composed of repeat units of both electrically neutral repeating units and ionized units covalently bonded to the polymer backbone as pendant group moieties. Usually no more than 15 mole percent are ionized. The ionized units are often carboxylic acid groups.\n\nThe classification of a polymer as an ionomer depends on the level of substitution of ionic groups as well as how the ionic groups are incorporated into the polymer structure. For example, polyelectrolytes also have ionic groups covalently bonded to the polymer backbone, but have a much higher ionic group molar substitution level (usually greater than 80%); ionenes are polymers where ionic groups are part of the actual polymer backbone. These two classes of ionic-group-containing polymers have vastly different morphological and physical properties and are therefore not considered ionomers. \n\nIonomers have unique physical properties including electrical conductivity and viscosity—increase in ionomer solution viscosity with increasing temperatures (see conducting polymer). Ionomers also have unique morphological properties as the non-polar polymer backbone is energetically incompatible with the polar ionic groups. As a result, the ionic groups in most ionomers will undergo microphase separation to form ionic-rich domains.\n\nCommercial applications for ionomers include golf ball covers, semipermeable membranes, sealing tape and thermoplastic elastomers. Common examples of ionomers include polystyrene sulfonate, Nafion and Hycar.\n\nUsually ionomer synthesis consists of two steps – the introduction of acid groups to the polymer backbone and the neutralization of some of the acid groups by a metal cation. In very rare cases, the groups introduced are already neutralized by a metal cation. The first step (introduction of acid groups) can be done in two ways; a neutral non-ionic monomer can be copolymerized with a monomer that contains pendant acid groups or acid groups can be added to a non-ionic polymer through post-reaction modifications. For example, ethylene-methacrylic acid and sulfonated perfluorocarbon (Nafion) are synthesized through copolymerization while polystyrene sulfonate is synthesized through post-reaction modifications.\n\nIn most cases, the acid form of the copolymer is synthesized (i.e. 100% of the carboxylic acid groups are neutralized by hydrogen cations) and the ionomer is formed through subsequent neutralization by the appropriate metal cation. The identity of the neutralizing metal cation has an effect on the physical properties of the ionomer; the most commonly used metal cations (at least in academic research) are zinc, sodium, and magnesium. Neutralization or ionomerization, can also be accomplished in two ways: the acid copolymer can be melt-mixed with a basic metal or neutralization can be achieved through solution processes. The former method is preferred commercially. However, as commercial manufacturers are reluctant to share their procedures, little is known about the exact conditions of the melt-mixing neutralization process other than that hydroxides are generally used to provide the metal cation. The latter solution neutralization process is generally used in academic settings. The acid copolymer is dissolved and a basic salt with the appropriate metal cation is added to this solution. Where dissolution of the acid copolymer is difficult, simply swelling the polymer in the solvent is sufficient, though dissolving is always preferred. Because basic salts are polar and are not soluble in the non-polar solvents used to dissolve most polymers, mixed solvents (e.g. 90:10 toluene/alcohol) are often used.\n\nNeutralization level must be determined after an ionomer is synthesized as varying the neutralization level varies the morphological and physical properties of the ionomer. One method used to do this is to examine the peak heights of infrared vibrations of the acid form. However, there may be substantial error in determining peak height, especially since small amounts of water appear in the same wavenumber range. Titration of the acid groups is another method that can be used, though this is not possible in some systems.\n\nSurlyn is the brand name of an ionomer resin created by DuPont, a copolymer of ethylene and methacrylic acid used as a coating and packaging material.\nDuPont neutralizes the acid with NaOH, yielding the sodium salt.\nCrystals of ethylene-methacrylic acid ionomers exhibit dual melting behavior.\n\nBy complexing metal ions into the polymer matrix, the strength and toughness of the ionomer system is increased. Some applications where ionomers were used to increase the toughness of the overall system include coatings, adhesives, impact modification, and thermoplastics, one of the most known examples being the use of Surlyn in the outer layer of golf balls. The ionomer coating improves the toughness, aerodynamics, and durability of the golf balls, increasing their lifetime. Ionomers can also be blended with resins to increase the cohesive strength without diminishing the overall tackiness of the resin, creating pressure sensitive adhesives for a variety of applications, including water or solvent-based adhesives. Ionomers using poly(ethylene-methacrylic acid) chains can also be used in film packaging due to their transparency, toughness, flexibility, resistance to staining, high gas permeability, and low sealing temperature. These qualities also translate to a high demand for using the ionomers in food-packing materials.\n\nWith the addition of the ion to a certain percentage of the polymer chain, the viscosity of the ionomer increases. This behavior can make ionomers a good viscosification material for drilling fluid applications where the system is under a low shear rate. Using the ionomer to increase the viscosity of the system helps prevent shear thinning behaviors within the drilling fluid, especially at higher temperatures of operation.\n\nAnother application includes the ability of an ionomer to increase the compatibility of polymer blends. This phenomenon is driven by thermodynamics and is achieved through the introduction of specific interactions between functional groups that are increasingly favorable in the presence of a metal ion. The miscibility can be driven not only by the increasingly favorable reaction between functional groups on two different polymers but also by having a strong repulsive interaction between the neutral and ionic species present within an ionomer, which can drive one of these species to be more miscible with the species of the other polymer within the blend. Some ionomers have been used for shape memory applications, meaning the material has a fixed shape that can be reformed using external stresses above a critical temperature and cooled, then regains the original shape when brought above the critical temperature and allowed to cool under no external stresses. Ionomers can form both chemical and physical crosslinks that can be modified easily at moderate processing temperatures, are less dense than shape memory alloys, and have a higher chance of being biocompatible for biomedical devices.\n\nSome more recent applications for ionomers include being used as ion-selective membranes in a variety of electrical and energy applications. Examples include the cation exchange membrane for fuel cells, which allow only protons or specific ions to cross the membrane, a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer to optimize the uniform coating of the catalyst on membrane surfaces, a redox flow battery separator, electrodialysis, where ions are transported between solutions using the ionomer membrane, and electrochemical hydrogen compressors to increase the strength of the membrane against the pressure differentials that can occur within the compressor. \n\n\n\n"}

This eye-catching butterfly has bright blue wings rimmed in black with white edges and silver spots on its hindwings, lending it the name of the silver-studded blue. \"P. argus\" can be found across Europe and Asia, but is most often studied in the United Kingdom in which the species has experienced a severe decline in population due to habitat loss and fragmentation.\n\nImportantly, \"P. argus\" engages in mutualism with ants that contribute to the butterflies’ reproductive fitness by providing protection from predation and parasitism from the point of egg laying to their emergence as adults. \"P. argus\" adults emerge in the end of June and beginning of July and engage in flight into the beginning of August.\n\nThe butterfly is adaptable to different habitats and is found in heathland, mossland, and limestone grassland. Tending towards a sedentary lifestyle and typically flying less than twenty meters a day, \"P. argus\" maintains a small radius home range. Their habitats lend themselves well to both foraging and egg laying as the host plants are ubiquitous in all three environments they occupy.\n\nMale \"P. argus\" have royal blue wings with a black border, white, wispy fringe, and metallic silver spots on the hindwings as well as spurs on their front legs. Females of this species are generally brown and more subdued in color, but also have the metallic spots on the hindwings. The undersides of the male and female butterflies are very similar. They are taupe in color, with rings of black spots along the edge of the wing.\n\"L. argus\" L. (= \"aegon\" Schiff., \"argyrotoxus\" Bgstr.) (78 c). This and the following species [\n\"argyrognomon\" ] have in the anal area of the hindwing beneath on the black submarginal dots situated between the median branches and the submedian vein some metallic glittering scales which are usually not represented in our figures. The upperside is deep dark blue, with a broad black border, \"argus\" is very similar to \"argyrognomon\", but differs in quite a number of details, of which in the various individuals sometimes one sometimes another is more conspicuously developed. On the upperside the blue gloss is deeper, darker, duller, with a slight violet tint and not so far extended to the margm, the latter being broader and appearing blacker; the row of dark submarginal dots which occasionally appear on the hindwing above in both species, therefore stands always in the black border in argus. On the underside both sexes of \"argus\" have nearly always a strongly glittering blue-green dusting at the base of the wings, which is usually absent from \"argyrognomon\"; but we must add that also the inverse occurs, the blue basal dusting being absent from \"argus\" in exceptional cases and strongly marked in argyrognomon. As a rule \"argus\" L., moreover, is somewhat smaller than \"argyrognomon\", but the size varies considerably according to the altitude of the locality and the various broods.\n— ab. \"valesiana\" M.-Durr is frequently found among specimens from the Valais (but not exclusively and not constantly) ; it is distinguished by a yellowish grey underside and very small ocelli. ab. \"corsica\" Bell., on the other hand, is a form which flies regularly in the mountains of Corsica and differs in the ocelli of the underside bearing pupils of the ground-colour and having larger borders, which almost form pale rings on a grey-brown ground. This form occurs as an exception everywhere, having been obtained by Standen even in Norway. Females which are nearly as blue above as the males are not very rare in certain localities, especially among the summer-broad, this is ab. \"coerulescens\" Peters (= \"pseudocallarga\" Neustetter). — A constant form is \"hypochiona\" Rbr. (78 d, ground-colour too dull), from the most southern very sunny districts of Europe (Ionian Islands, Greece, Andalusia); underside rather pale, the black eye-dots small and placed in large pale halos, before the margin a row of bright red spots. Similar individuals are occasionally also found in other districts, e. g. at Digne and according to Jones even in\nEngland. — A very large form is \"insularis\" Leech (78 d), from the north-island of Japan; its underside resembles hypochiona in its light pure ground-colour, but bears abundant and prominent black spots. Above the marginal spots of the hindwing are especially very distinct. — Also \"bella\" H.-Sch. (78 d, e) is placed by Staudinger and Rebel as a variety of argus; it is a small form, which resembles \"hypochiona\" beneath, but is very dark above, with very thin red-yellow submarginal spots on the upperside of the hindwing, which are unfortunately not visible in our figure 78 d, the hindwing beneath bearing paler marginal spots; from the shores of the Black Sea, Armenia and Persia. — Perhaps also \"iburiensis\" Btlr. [ now full species \"Plebejus iburiensis\" (Butler, [1882])]belongs here; it is unknown to me in nature and was described from one specimen from Hokkaido; it appears to be a kind of albino of \"insularis\". — Very small specimens, as they are found especially in Valais, are \"alpina\" Berce; exceptionally large specimens were obtained by Chapman at Bejar in Spain and named by him \"bejarensis\" [ now subspecies]. — The form \"micrargus\" Btlr. [ now subspecies ] from Tokio, which is quite unknown to me, is said to have the lilac colour of \"argia\", with the black margin dentate and the fringes very bright white; beneath in colour like \"pylaon\", the spots as in \"argus\", but without the metallic scales on the anal spots. — \"pseudaegon\" Btlr. [now full species \"Plebejus pseudaegon\" (Butler, [1882])], from the north-island, is smaller than \"argus\", with the black margin narrower, the white fringes thinner, and the black distal marginal spots of the hindwing above smaller, female very feebly dusted with steel-blue at the base, underside more extended green than in true \"argus\" and its ocelli smaller.Likewise unknown to me.— Sometimes there occurs a basal dot on the underside; this is ab. \"unipuncta\" Mousley. In ab. \"coeruleocuneata\" Ebert there appear blue wedge-shaped submarginal spots on the upperside of the hindwing. — Larva very variable, usually light green with dark dorsal spots, sometimes however grey or dark brown with pale spots. In June and the autumn on various plants, such as \"Coronilla\", \"Trifolium\", \"Colutea\", and \"Genista\", said to occur also on \"Erica\", \"Ornithopus\", \"Fragaria\", \"Thymus\" and other plants. Near or upon the larva there is a guard of ants, usually specimens of \"Formica cinerea\" Mayr. The larva as well as the chrysalis are found in the nests of this ant. Pupa elongate, green with red dorsal line; abdomen above yellowish green. The butterflies are on the wing in May and again from July onwards, but are said to have only one brood in the north. They are common everywhere, especially on sandy soil, which also its ant prefers, but is said to noticeably decrease recently in numbers in some districts (e. g. in England). The form \"alpina\" I found in large numbers in Valais below Zermatt towards evening in stony localities where they were at rest in small bushes ; I counted 38 sleeping specimens in a small thornbush, all having the small size of the form of that neighbourhood.\nThe caterpillar of \"P. argus\" is green with a dark stripe along the length of its body and can reach 1.3 centimeters in length.\n\n\"P. argus\" exhibit sexual dimorphism, as evidenced by the color of their wings. This eventually acts as an important visual cue when searching for suitable mates. Experiments have shown that species that have overlapping habitat distribution and are of similar color (according to the human eye) have distinct absorbance values within the UV range. This shows that the UV range colors are important for butterflies when recognizing members of its own species.\n\n\"P. argus\" is found across the Palearctic. In the United Kingdom, the butterfly experienced a severe decline in population during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. \"P. argus\" is generally considered to be endangered and extinct in the Northern United Kingdom and are primarily found in the Southern and Western portions of the United Kingdom.\n\n\"P. argus\" resides in heathland, mossland, and limestone grassland.\n\nHeathlands are able to meet the needs of \"P. argus\" due to burning, cutting, and other disruptions of mature heaths. With these disruptions, the habitat becomes conducive to habitation by \"P. argus\" because of the high cover of \"E. cinerea\" and short \"C. vulgaris\" that is able to form a landscape with the patches of bare ground. This is characteristic of heathland in an early stage of development. This environment is suitable until the point at which the shrubs native to the environment mature and obscure the bare ground and vegetation margins that the butterflies use for oviposition.\n\nMossland, similar in nature to a wet heathland, has soil primarily composed of peat which supports one of the families of host plants of \"P. argus\", Ericaceae. This host plant grows alongside other grasses, sedges, and rushes. While the main disturbance to heathland is quarrying, mossland faces peat digging which contributes to the transient and shifting nature of this particular habitat.\n\nThe hostplants of the first two environments, Ericaceae and Leguminosae, are less present in the third environment, limestone grassland. In this environment, the host plants of \"P. argus\" are primarily herbaceous Cistaceae as well as Leguminosae. In limestone grassland, the bare ground and vegetation margins instrumental to the life cycle of \"P. argus\" are created through grazing by other animals as well as by disruption of the habitat by natural disturbance of the stoney topography of this environment.\n\n\"P. argus\" use shrubs for roosting, resting, basking, mate location, and shelter and for this reason, they tend to be found in higher numbers close to locations that are dense in shrubs. Most of the population gathers around these shrubs during weather that is colder, cloudy, and windy. When the weather is warm, sunny, and the breeze is still, \"P. argus\" spends less time in shrub dense habitats and more time in flight and finding host plants in areas rich in calcareous heath. These areas tend to be in exposed hillsides. For this reason, it often appears that the habitat of \"P. argus\" shifts with weather conditions.\n\nIn addition to choice of habitat due to host plants and topography, \"P. argus\" density correlates with the densities of nest of the butterflies’ mutualist ants, \"Lasius niger\" and \"Lasius alienus\".\n\nAdult \"P. argus\" tend to be very sedentary, only moving around twenty meters every day. For this reason, the butterflies colonize on discrete territory and patches of land. Some butterflies, though, disperse and move over a kilometer between colonies. This is rare, however, as these butterflies tend to form metapopulations.\n\nDifferent types of \"P. argus\" larvae choose different host plants. The limestone larvae, caernensis, preferentially select Helianthemum species over heathers as a host plant, while heathland larvae select heathers over Helianthemum.\n\nAdult \"P. argus\" eat a combination of leguminous and ericaceous plants, depending on which environment they are in. On heathland, the butterflies tend to feast on Heather (\"Calluna vulgaris\") and Bell Heather (\"Erica cinerea\"), while on calcareous sites, they eat \"Lotus corniculatus\", \"Helianthemum nummularium\", and \"Hippocrepis comosa\".\n\n\"P. argus\" lays its eggs differently based on its environment. In heathland, they lay their eggs at the base of \"Erica tetralix\", \"Cailuna vulgaris\", \"Erica cinerea\", and \"Ulex europaeus\". In mosslands, the butterflies tend to lay their eggs on the underside of the fronds of the Bracken Fern. This fern appears to be preferential for oviposition because they attract ants. In limestone grasslands, \"P. argus\" lays eggs at the stem of \"Lotus corniculatus\" and at the base of \"Helianthemum chamaecistus.\"\n\nEgg guarding primarily occurs through mutualism with the ants \"Lasius niger\" and \"Lasius alienus\". Mothers lay their eggs in locations with strong pheromonal traces from these organisms. From the time of oviposition to hatching, \"L. niger\" and \"L. alienus\" protect the eggs from predation and parasitism by other organisms. In return, the ants feed on a saccharine secretion produced by glands on the larvae.\n\nThe life cycles of Plebejus argus are divided into four main stages: eggs, larvae, pupa, and adults.\nLarvae usually spend the day in the nests of the ants. This helps them avoid predation and high temperatures, especially in the hot summer months. They come out at night and climb the host plant in order to feed.\n\n\"P. argus\" adults emerge in the end of June and beginning of July and engage in flight into the beginning of August. In these butterflies, there is a sex difference in emergence, with males emerging four to nine days earlier than females. As colony size increases, \"P. argus\" are temporally recorded earlier in the year. Additionally, as colony size increases, female emergence happens over a greater range of time and there is a greater discrepancy between emergence of the males and emergence of the females.\n\n\nWhen a male detects a female sitting quiescently, he flies towards the female. As he approaches the female, he flutters his wings in broad sweeping movements and she raises her abdomen while vibrating her half-open wings in a mate refusal posture. The female then flies away and is followed by the male. Once she lands, the male flutters around, either in the air before descending or after landing. The female displays a receptive posture by folding her wings after which the male positions himself parallel to the female before bending his abdomen, spreading the valves, and exposing the copulatory apparatus. He proceeds to attach to the copulatory apparatus and the butterflies reorient themselves into the copulatory position. The intermediate aspects of sexual chase depend on the sexual receptiveness of the female to the advances of the male.\n\n\"P. argus\" lays eggs near nests of \"Lasius niger\", the ant with which they form a mutualistic relationship. This mutualistic relationship benefits the adult butterfly by reducing the need for parental investment. Once the eggs hatch, the ants chaperone the larvae, averting the attacks of predatory organisms like wasps and spiders as well as parasites. In return, the ants receive a saccharine secretion fortified with amino acids from an eversible gland on the larvae's back. As first instar larvae prepare to pupate, the ants carry the larvae into their nests. Once the larvae become pupae, the ants continue to provide protection against predation and parasitism. The butterfly leaves the nest when it emerges in June.\n\n\"P. argus\" has undergone habitat loss and fragmentation in the United Kingdom due to the development of industrial agriculture, new forestry practices, and landscape development. Additionally, the percentage of heathland has decreased by over fifty percent in the United Kingdom, greatly affecting the butterflies for which this was a primary habitat. The heathland that remained was reduced in quality due to shifting environmental influences. Rabbits helped keep vegetation short through grazing which was conducive to habitation by \"P. argus\", but in the middle of the twentieth century, a virus, Myxomatosis, caused a significant decline in the population of rabbits and therefore the grass length grew to a point that was no longer conducive to the butterflies.\n\n"}
{"id": "2206537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206537", "title": "I Should Be So Lucky", "text": "I Should Be So Lucky\n\n\"I Should Be So Lucky\" is a 1987 song performed by Australian recording artist and songwriter Kylie Minogue from her debut studio album \"Kylie\" (1988). Released on 29 December 1987 by Mushroom Records and PWL Records, the song became a worldwide breakthrough hit; its image of Minogue on the front cover was shot by David Levine. The song was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman for Minogue, and they went on to produce Minogue's first four studio albums.\n\n\"I Should Be So Lucky\" received positive reviews from contemporary music critics, who thought that the song was an instant highlight and good song within the 80s, while some dismissed the lyrical content. Despite this, the song received commercial attention around the world where the song topped the charts in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany and peaked in the top ten in many countries including New Zealand, Japan and the Dance charts in the U.S.\n\nAfter the success of her debut single \"Locomotion\" in Australia, Minogue traveled to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, a successful British writing and production team. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \"I Should Be So Lucky\" in forty minutes while she waited outside the recording studio. Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response to what he had learned about Minogue prior to her arrival. He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia and very talented, there must be something wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills. After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera, \"Neighbours\". Stock later told \"The Guardian\": \"We had to get the song together in about 40 minutes and she left not having had a happy experience. We didn’t know we had a hit on our hands and so when it went to No 1 for five weeks, someone said: \"What’s the follow-up?” We didn't have one. So I went out to Australia at the start of 1988 and met her in a bar with Jason and her manager. I basically crawled 100 yards on my knees and apologised profusely.\"\n\n\"I Should Be So Lucky\" is a pop and hi-NRG song which features elements of bubblegum pop and new wave music. According to the music sheet on MusicNotes.com, which was published by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song is set in the key of C major. Minogue's vocals span from D to C. The song is set in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 116 beats per minute. Instrumentation of the song features synthesizers, keyboards and guitars. According to PopMatters, the song features \"numerous orchestra hits to the uncomfortably thin sounding drum machine.\" Waterman has said the tune was inspired by Pachelbel's Canon. Stock told \"The Guardian\": \"Anyone who thinks \"I Should Be So Lucky\" is easy should try to play it. It's in four keys, all of them really awkward, and you can't even strum it unless you're a really good musician.\"\n\n\"I Should Be So Lucky\" garnered positive reviews from some music critics. Nick Levine, from \"Digital Spy\", called it \"standout track\". Chris True from AllMusic had reviewed the album, and highlighted the song as an album standout. But as a separate rating, they gave the single three stars out of five. In the review of \"The Best of Kylie Minogue\" (2012), Tim Sendra highlighted it as an album standout. Hunter Felt from \"PopMatters\" gave it a positive review, stating \"something about Kylie’s innocent yet forceful vocals and the sheer catchiness of the song itself [...] So the song became a beloved secret, and I never bothered to try to tune my friends in on \"I Could Be So Lucky\", or, crazier yet, proclaim that this \"has-been\" would be a critical and commercial darling in a few years time.\" However, he did say the song was cliché. However, Mark Edwards from \"Stylus Magazine\" gave it a scathing remark by saying \"Listening to the first tracks on Ultimate Kylie, you want to skip straight through, because early songs like \"I Should Be So Lucky\" and \"Locomotion\" are unlistenable—horribly naff, squeaky songs\" and criticized Stock, Aitken and Waterman songs they produced in the 80s by stating \"[the songs] transport the listener back to a time when every single in the UK charts was either written by Stock, Aitken and Waterman or sung by an Aussie soap star, or both.\" \"OK!\" called the song a \"classic\".\n\nThe song was also known to many in the late 1980s and early 1990s as one of Minogue's signature songs, which many critics entering the song on their best track or worst track list. And additionally, in 2011, \"I Should Be So Lucky\" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry. \"I Should Be So Lucky\" later appeared on seven of Kylie's hit compilations including \"Greatest Hits\" (1992), \"Ultimate Kylie\" (2004) and \"\" (2019). The song won the Highest Selling Single award at the 3rd annual ARIA Awards.\n\n\"I Should Be So Lucky\" was released in the UK on 29 December 1987, and in Australia on 1 February 1988. It was a commercial success, reaching atop the Australian Kent Music Report chart for six consecutives weeks, and became her second number-one single, following Locomotion. The single was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and ranked at number five on the Year-end chart for 1988. In New Zealand, the song entered at No. 15 on New Zealand Top 40 and peaked at No. 3 on 27 March 1988, spending twelve weeks on the chart. In United Kingdom, \"I Should Be So Lucky\" was released on 29 December 1987. The song entered at No. 90 on the UK Singles Chart, climbing to No. 54 the following week and three weeks later, it was No. 1 and remained at the top position for five weeks. It spent seventeen weeks on the chart. It was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for the shipment of 600,000 copies. The song was one of the best-selling singles of 1988, with estimated sales of over 675,000.\n\nElsewhere, \"I Should Be So Lucky\" peaked on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the Hot Dance Club Play. The song reached No. 10 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart on 4 June 1988 and no. 28 on the Hot 100 on 16 July 1988. Across Europe, \"I Should Be So Lucky\" also topped the singles charts in Germany, Ireland and Switzerland. It became a top-five hit in Austria, France and Norway, as well as a top-thirty hit in Belgium, Netherlands and Sweden. It peaked at No. 1 in Finland, Israel and Hong Kong. The song was certified silver by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) and gold in Germany.\n\nThe music video for \"I Should Be So Lucky\" was directed by Chris Langman and filmed in November 1987 at Channel 7 Studios in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The video features Minogue walking through her home, with scenes of her dancing in front of a colourful chalkboard background intercut throughout. It presented a cute, wholesome, young \"girl-next-door\" image of Minogue to the public, with scenes of her giggling and making funny faces to the camera.\n\nAnother version of the video was made for live television promotion. This version of the video shows Kylie riding in a car with several friends through Sydney. In other parts of the video, she's in the park and passersby are waving to her as she walks by them. This video premiered in the UK on Christmas Day 1987 in a live broadcast from the British Telecom Tower (Christmas Morning With Noel Edmonds, BBC1).\n\nThe complete version of \"I Should Be So Lucky\" featured in the music video has been released commercially through multiple VHS and DVD collections. Its most recent inclusion is on the companion DVD to her 2012 greatest hits album, \"The Best of Kylie Minogue\". Outtakes from the music video were used in \"Kylie: The Videos\".\n\nThe British satirical programme \"Spitting Image\" made a send-up of \"I Should Be So Lucky\" entitled \"Kylie Minogue\", in which Minogue is depicted as being brought to life in a way similar to Frankenstein's monster in an old 1930s movie. The action shifts between the laboratory to an apartment similar to that of the original video. The song also pokes fun at her performance in the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\", in which as Charlene Mitchell, later Robinson she was best known at the time, and implies that she was lucky to have been chosen over other soap stars, namely Paul Henry who was Benny Hawkins in the British drama \"Crossroads\". Stock, Aitken and Waterman are combined together as a large tape player providing creature-Minogue's voice which at one point is distorted to sound like Rick Astley.\n\n\"Kylie Minogue\" is track 4 on the 1990 Spitting Image CD \"20 Great Golden Gobs\".\n\nBritish comedians French and Saunders included a send-up of the song during the third season of their show (broadcast 26 April 1990). The sketch features the recording of the song with an orchestra and vocals by three opera divas, played by French, Saunders, and British mezzo-soprano Sarah Walker.\n\nIn 1988, Hong Kong singer released a version in Cantonese titled \"請勿貼身\" (translation: \"Don't Stay Close\"). The sketch comedy television show \"French & Saunders\" made a parody of \"I Should Be So Lucky\" featuring mezzo-soprano Sarah Walker. Right after the release of the original song. Brazilian pop artist Simony recorded a version in Brazilian Portuguese entitled \"Acho Que Sou Louca\" (translation: \"I Think I'm Crazy\"). Japanese singer Kanako Wada covered this song in Japanese named \"Lucky Love\". In 1992, the Egyptian pop singer Simon recorded a cover of the song with new lyrics in Arabic titled \"Bahibak Aawy\". French guitarist Noel Akchote's 2007 album \"So Lucky\" includes an instrumental cover. In September 2007, a cover version of \"I Should Be So Lucky\" appeared on the album \"Dolce Vita\" by Spanish singer Soraya Arnelas. Also that year, Japanese duo Mihimaru GT released a hip hop cover version of the song. It was released as a double A-side single, along with the song \"Ai Kotoba\", in Japan in November 2007. In 2008, Northern Kings recorded a rock version of this song included on their second album \"Rethroned\". In 2016, Korean girlgroup CLC covered it as a B-side for their Japanese single \"High Heels\".\n\nThe Kylie Minogue recording is featured in the 1989 film \"Cookie\".\n\nThe cover version of this song had been featured in 1989's Miss USA Pageant.\n\nIrish rock band U2 included snippets of the \"I Should Be So Lucky\" lyrics into their live version of \"Angel of Harlem\" on their Australian tour dates upon dedicating their song to Minogue.\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinogue performed the song on the following concert tours:\n\nThe song was also performed on:\n\nCredits adapted from the \"Kylie\" liner notes.\n\n\n\n"}

Like most adaptations of the Twain novel, it focuses on the lighter aspects of the story. The music was written by Richard Rodgers, the lyrics by Lorenz Hart, and the book by Herbert Fields. It was produced by Lew Fields and Lyle D. Andrews. It enjoyed an original run on Broadway in 1927 of 421 performances and a number of revivals.\n\nThe 1931 film of the same name starring Will Rogers was not adapted from this musical, nor was the 1949 musical film \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\", which starred Bing Crosby. The Rodgers and Hart \"Connecticut Yankee\", like many of the team's earlier musicals, has never been filmed for the big screen though a scene was staged for the 1948 biographical movie of the lives of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, \"Words and Music\".\n\n\"A Connecticut Yankee\" opened on Broadway at the Vanderbilt Theatre on November 3, 1927, and closed on October 27, 1928, running for 421 performances. Directed by Alexander Leftwich, with dances by Busby Berkeley, it starred William Gaxton (Martin, the Yankee), Constance Carpenter (Alice Carter/The Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise), and June Cochrane (Mistress Evelyn Al Belle-Ans).\n\nA Broadway revival opened at the Martin Beck Theatre (now the Al Hirschfeld Theatre) on November 17, 1943, and closed on March 11, 1944, after 135 performances. Directed by John C. Wilson and choreographed by William Holbrook and Al White, Jr., it featured Vivienne Segal (Lt. Merrill/Queen Morgan Le Fay), Dick Foran (Lt. Martin Barrett), Vera-Ellen (Mistress Evelyn Al Belle-Ans), and Robert Chisholm (Admiral Arthur/King Arthur of Britain).\n\nA television adaptation was broadcast on NBC on March 12, 1955, with Eddie Albert, Janet Blair, Gale Sherwood, and Boris Karloff.\n\nNew York City Center Encores! presented a staged concert in 2001, with Christine Ebersole (Fay Morgan/Morgan Le Fay), Henry Gibson (Arthur Pendragos/King Arthur), Ron Leibman (Sir Launcelot) and Jessica Walter (Guinevere).\n\nIn Connecticut in the 1920s, Martin is about to be married to Fay. When an old flame, Alice, visits him, Fay knocks him out with a champagne bottle in a jealous fit. As Martin dreams, he is seemingly in the court of King Arthur in 528. Dubbed \"Sir Boss\" by Arthur, Martin is directed to industrialize Camelot, which he does, including telephones, and radios. He falls in love with \"Demoiselle Alisande\" (\"Alice\") but the king's evil sister, \"Morgan Le Fay\" (\"Fay\"), kidnaps her. As Martin rescues her, he wakes up and realizes that it was Alice that he loved all along.\n\nThe 1943 revival was revised by Rodgers and Hart. The setting was changed to a more topical war-time setting, and the show art showed a knight and his damsel in a jeep. \"Morgan Le Fay\" was turned into a \"singing sorceress\" anti-heroine, and the song \"To Keep My Love Alive\" was written especially for this revival, for Vivienne Segal to perform.\n\nAmong the best remembered songs are the up-tempo duet, \"Thou Swell\", the ballad \"My Heart Stood Still\", \"On a Desert Island with Thee\", and \"I Feel at Home with You\". For the 1943 revival, Rodgers and Hart added several additional songs, including \"Can't You Do a Friend a Favor?\" and \"To Keep My Love Alive\", Hart's last song and a hit for star Vivienne Segal.\n\nA recording of the 1943 revival was released on June 29, 1944, by Decca.\n\n\n"}

He is a prominent evangelical scholar and author. \n\nCarson has been described as doing \"the most seminal New Testament work by contemporary evangelicals\" and as \"one of the last great Renaissance men in evangelical biblical scholarship.\" He has written on a wide range of topics including New Testament, hermeneutics, biblical theology, the Greek New Testament, the use of the Old Testament in the New, and more. \n\nCarson was born on December 21, 1946, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His parents were Thomas Donald McMillan Carson and Elizabeth Margaret (née Maybury). He grew up in Drummondville, the second of three children, where his father pastored a bilingual church. His father planted multiple churches and pastored in French-speaking Canada. Carson spent the years of 1963–1967 in Montreal at McGill University where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry and mathematics. He then moved to Toronto where he completed his Master of Divinity degree from Central Baptist Seminary (now Heritage Baptist College and Heritage Theological Seminary). From 1970 to 1972, he pastored in Richmond, British Columbia, and was ordained in 1972. In 1972, Carson moved to England to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the New Testament from the University of Cambridge which he completed in 1975. \n\nAt Cambridge, Carson studied under Barnabas Lindars, whose \"Festschrift\" he edited in 1988. His dissertation was entitled, \"Predestination and Responsibility: Elements of Tension-Theology in the Fourth Gospel Against Jewish Background\". A revised and simplified form of his dissertation was published in 1981 under the title, \"Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility: Biblical Themes in Tension\".\n\nUpon completion of his doctorate, Carson moved back to Canada and served for three years at Northwest Baptist Theological College (now Northwest Baptist Seminary) in Vancouver as associate professor of New Testament and later as founding dean of the seminary in 1976. Carson joined the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School faculty in 1978 after then dean, Kenneth Kantzer, heard him deliver a paper at a theological conference. Carson served as Associate Professor of New Testament until 1982 when he became full professor. From 1991 to 2018, Carson was Research Professor of New Testament. He is now Emeritus Professor of New Testament. \n\nCarson has authored and edited over 60 books.

{"id": "2206555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206555", "title": "Annexin", "text": "Annexin\n\nAnnexin is a common name for a group of cellular proteins. They are mostly found in eukaryotic organisms (animal, plant and fungi).\n\nIn humans, the annexins are found inside the cell. However some annexins (Annexin A1, Annexin A2, and Annexin A5) have also been found outside the cellular environment, for example, in blood. How the annexins are transported out of the cell into the blood is currently unknown because they lack a signal peptide necessary for proteins to be transported out of the cell.\n\nAnnexin is also known as \"lipocortin\". Lipocortins suppress phospholipase A2. Increased expression of the gene coding for annexin-1 is one of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids (such as cortisol) inhibit inflammation.\n\nThe protein family of annexins has continued to grow since their association with intracellular membranes was first reported in 1977. The recognition that these proteins were members of a broad family first came from protein sequence comparisons and their cross-reactivity with antibodies. One of these workers (Geisow) coined the name Annexin shortly after.\n\nAs of 2002 160 annexin proteins have been identified in 65 different species. The criteria that a protein has to meet to be classified as an annexin are: it has to be capable of binding negatively charged phospholipids in a calcium dependent manner and must contain a 70 amino acid repeat sequence called an annexin repeat. Several proteins consist of annexin with other domains like gelsolin.\n\nThe basic structure of an annexin is composed of two major domains. The first is located at the COOH terminal and is called the “core” region. The second is located at the NH2 terminal and is called the “head” region. The core region consists of an alpha helical disk. The convex side of this disk has type 2 calcium-binding sites. They are important for allowing interaction with the phospholipids at the plasma membrane. The N terminal region is located on the concave side of the core region and is important for providing a binding site for cytoplasmic proteins. In some annexins it can become phosphorylated and can cause affinity changes for calcium in the core region or alter cytoplasmic protein interaction.\n\nAnnexins are important in various cellular and physiological processes such as providing a membrane scaffold, which is relevant to changes in the cell's shape. Also, annexins have been shown to be involved in trafficking and organization of vesicles, exocytosis, endocytosis and also calcium ion channel formation. Annexins have also been found outside the cell in the extracellular space and have been linked to fibrinolysis, coagulation, inflammation and apoptosis.\n\nThe first study to identify annexins was published by Creutz \"et al.\" (1978). These authors used bovine adrenal glands and identified a calcium dependent protein that was responsible for aggregation of granules amongst each other and the plasma membrane. This protein was given the name synexin, which comes from the Greek word “synexis” meaning “meeting”.\n\nSeveral subfamilies of annexins have been identified based on structural and functional differences. However, all annexins share a common organizational theme that involves two distinct regions, an annexin core and an amino (N)-terminus. The annexin core is highly conserved across the annexin family and the N-terminus varies greatly. The variability of the N-terminus is a physical construct for variation between subfamilies of annexins.\n\nThe 310 amino acid annexin core has four annexin repeats, each composed of 5 alpha-helices. The exception is annexin A-VI that has two annexin core domains connected by a flexible linker. A-VI was produced via duplication and fusion of the genes for A-V and A-X and therefore will not be discussed in length. The four annexin repeats produce a curved protein and allow functional differences based on the structure of the curve. The concave side of the annexin core interacts with the N-terminus and cytosolic second messengers, while the convex side of the annexin contains calcium binding sites. Each annexin core contains one type II, also known as an annexin type, calcium binding site; these binding sites are the typical location of ionic membrane interactions. However, other methods of membrane connections are possible. For example, A-V exposes a tryptophan residue, upon calcium binding, which can interact with the hydrocarbon chains of the lipid bilayer.\n\nThe diverse structure of the N-terminus confers specificity to annexin intracellular signaling. In all annexins the N-terminus is thought to sit inside the concave side of the annexin core and folds separately from the rest of the protein. The structure of this region can be divided into two broad categories, short and long N-termini. A short N-terminus, as seen in A-III, can consist of 16 or less amino acids and travels along the concave protein core interacting via hydrogen bonds. Short N-termini are thought to stabilize the annexin complex in order to increase calcium binding and can be the sites for post-translational modifications. Long N-termini can contain up to 40 residues and have a more complex role in annexin signaling. For example, in A-I the N-terminus folds into an amphipathic alpha-helix and inserts into the protein core, displacing helix D of annexin repeat III. However, when calcium binds, the N-terminus is pushed from the annexin core by conformational changes within the protein. Therefore, the N-terminus can interact with other proteins, notably the S-100 protein family, and includes phosphorylation sites which allow for further signaling. A-II can also use its long N-terminal to form a heterotrimer between a S100 protein and two peripheral annexins. The structural diversity of annexins is the grounds for the functional range of these complex, intracellular messengers.\n\nAnnexins are characterized by their calcium dependent ability to bind to negatively charged phospholipids (i.e. membrane walls). They are located in some but not all of the membranous surfaces within a cell, which would be evidence of a heterogeneous distribution of Ca within the cell.\n\nAnnexin species (II,V,XI) have been found within the membranes. Tyrosine kinase activity has been shown to increase the concentrations of Annexins II,V within the nucleus. Annexin XI is predominantly located within the nucleus, and absent from the nucleoli. During prophase, annexin XI will translocate to the nuclear envelope.\n\nAnnexins are abundant in bone matrix vesicles, and are speculated to play a role in Ca entry into vesicles during hydroxyapatite formation. The subject area has not been thoroughly studied, however it has been speculated that annexins may be involved in closing the neck of the matrix vesicle as it is endocytosed.\n\nAnnexins have been observed to play a role along the exocytotic pathway, specifically in the later stages, near or at the plasma membrane. Evidence of annexins or annexin-like proteins are involved in exocytosis has been found in lower organisms, such as the \"Paramecium\". Through antibody recognition, there is evidence of the annexin like proteins being involved in the positioning and attachment of secretory organelles in the organism \"Paramecium\".\n\nAnnexin VII was the first annexin to be discovered while searching for proteins that promote the contact and fusion of chromaffin granules. In Vitro studies however have shown that annexin VII does not promote the fusion of membranes, only the close attachment to one another.\n\nAnnexins have been found to be involved in the transport and also sorting of endocytotic events. Annexin one is a substrate of the EGF (epidermal growth factor) tyrosine kinase which becomes phosphorylated on its N terminus when the receptor is internalized. Unique endosome targeting sequences have been found in the N terminus of annexins I and II, which would be useful in sorting of endocytotic vesicles. Annexins are present in several different endocytotic processes. Annexin VI is thought to be involved in clathrin coated budding events, while annexin II participates in both cholesteryl ester internalization and the biogenesis of multi-vesicular endosomes.\n\nAnnexins can function as scaffolding proteins to anchor other proteins to the cell membrane. Annexins assemble as trimers, where this trimer formation is facilitated by calcium influx and efficient membrane binding. This trimer assembly is often stabilized by other membrane-bound annexin cores in the vicinity. Eventually, enough annexin trimers will assemble and bind the cell membrane. This will induce the formation of membrane-bound annexin networks. These networks can induce the indentation and vesicle budding during an exocytosis event.\n\nWhile different types of annexins can function as membrane scaffolds, annexin A-V is the most abundant membrane-bound annexin scaffold. Annexin A-V can form 2-dimensional networks when bound to the phosphatidylserine unit of the membrane. Annexin A-V is effective in stabilizing changes in cell shape during endocytosis and exocytosis, as well as other cell membrane processes. Alternatively, annexins A-I and A-II bind phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine units in the cell membrane, and are often found forming monolayered clusters that lack a definite shape.\n\nIn addition, annexins A-I and A-II have been shown to bind PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) in the cell membrane and facilitate actin assembly near the membrane.\nMore recently, annexin scaffolding functions have been linked to medical applications. These medical implications have been uncovered with in vivo studies where the path of a fertilized egg is tracked to the uterus. After fertilization, the egg must enter a canal for which the opening is up to five times smaller than the diameter of the egg. Once the fertilized egg has passed through the opening, annexins are believed to promote membrane folding in an accordion-like fashion to return the stretched membrane back to its original form. Though this was discovered in the nematode annexin NEX-1, it is believed that a similar mechanism takes place in humans and other mammals.\n\nSeveral annexins have been shown to have active roles in the organization of the membrane. Annexin A-II has been extensively studied in this aspect of annexin function and is noted to be heavily involved in the organization of lipids in the bilayer near sites of actin cytoskeleton assembly. Annexin A-II can bind PIP2 in the cell membrane in vivo with a relatively high binding affinity.\n\nIn addition, Annexin A-II can bind other membrane lipids such as cholesterol, where this binding is made possible by the influx of calcium ions. The binding of Annexin A-II to lipids in the bilayer orchestrates the organization of lipid rafts in the bilayer at sites of actin assembly. In fact, annexin A-II is itself an actin-binding protein and therefore it can form a region of interaction with actin by means of its filamentous actin properties. In turn, this allows for further cell-cell interactions between monolayers of cells like epithelial and endothelial cells. In addition to annexin A-II, annexin A-XI has also been shown to organize cell membrane properties. Annexin A-XI is believed to be highly involved in the last stage of mitosis: cytokinesis. It is in this stage that daughter cells separate from one another because annexin A-XI inserts a new membrane that is believed to be required for abscission. Without annexin A-XI, it is believed that the daughter cells with not fully separate and may undergo apoptosis.\n\nAnnexin A-I seems to be one of the most heavily involved annexins in anti-inflammatory responses. Upon infection or damage to tissues, annexin A-I is believed to reduce inflammation of tissues by interacting with annexin A-I receptors on leukocytes. In turn, the activation of these receptors functions to send the leukocytes to the site of infection and target the source of inflammation directly. As a result, this inhibits leukocyte (specifically neutrophils) extravasation and down regulates the magnitude of the inflammatory response. Without annexin A-I in mediating this response, neutrophil extravasation is highly active and worsens the inflammatory response in damaged or infected tissues.\n\nAnnexin A-I has also been implicated in apoptotic mechanisms in the cell. When expressed on the surface of neutrophils, annexin A-I promotes pro-apoptotic mechanisms. Alternatively, when expressed on the cell surface, annexin A-I promotes the removal of cells that have undergone apoptosis.\nMoreover, annexin A-I has further medical implications in the treatment of cancer. Annexin A-I can be used as a cell surface protein to mark some forms of tumors that can be targeted by various immunotherapies with antibodies against annexin A-I.\n\nAnnexin A-V is the major player when it comes to mechanisms of coagulation. Like other annexin types, annexin A-V can also be expressed on the cell surface and can function to form 2-dimensional crystals to protect the lipids of the cell membrane from involvement in coagulation mechanisms. Medically speaking, phospholipids can often be recruited in autoimmune responses, most commonly observed in cases of fetal loss during pregnancy. In such cases, antibodies against annexin A-V destroy its 2-dimensional crystal structure and uncover the phospholipids in the membrane, making them available for contribution to various coagulation mechanisms.\n\nWhile several annexins may be involved in mechanisms of fibrinolysis, annexin A-II is the most prominent in mediating these responses. The expression of annexin A-II on the cell surface is believed to serve as a receptor for plasminogen, which functions to produce plasmin. Plasmin initiates fibrinolysis by degrading fibrin. The destruction of fibrin is a natural preventative measure because it prevents the formation of blood clots by fibrin networks.\n\nAnnexin A-II has medical implications because it can be utilized in treatments for various cardiovascular diseases that thrive on blood clotting through fibrin networks.\n\n\nANXA1; ANXA10; ANXA11; ANXA13; ANXA2; ANXA3; ANXA4; ANXA5;\nANXA6; ANXA7; ANXA8; ANXA8L1; ANXA8L2; ANXA9;\n\n"}

It was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions (also responsible for the \"Challenge of the GoBots\" television series) and released to theaters in 1986 by Clubhouse Pictures, the last film the company released. It featured the first appearance of the Rock Lords, who were given their own toyline after the film.\n\nThese new characters featured the guest voices of Margot Kidder, Telly Savalas and Roddy McDowall. The regulars from the cartoon series all reprised their roles (though Arthur Bughardt played Cop-Tur, as he had in several late television episodes, following the death of Bob Holt).\n\nThe Guardian Gobots are continuing their work on rebuilding their home planet of Gobotron when a mysterious ship crashes on the planet. Leader-1, Turbo and Scooter investigate, and find it to be occupied by a pair of transforming rocks - Solitaire and her valet Nugget. They have come seeking the Guardians' help to save their planet, Quartex, from the evil Rock Lord Magmar, who is killing the other Rock Lords in order to take their power sceptres. He places these in a machine designed to channel all their power into his own sceptre.\n\nThe Guardians agree to help, but the conversation is spied upon by the Renegade Fitor. Gobotron is soon attacked by the Renegade fleet, and Cy-Kill and a team of Renegades capture Solitaire, Small Foot, Nick, and A.J.. With Nugget as their guide, Leader-1, Turbo, Scooter, and Matt set off on a rescue mission.\n\nOn Quartex, after relieving a vanquished Rock Lord of his sceptre, Magmar now only requires three more to complete his own. One is held by the Lord of Fossils, the other by Solitaire, and the last by Boulder and his forces; the only opposition left. His troops vote to attack Boulder and be done with him, but Boulder learns of the upcoming attack, and is able to launch an effective counter defence that sees Magmar on the verge of defeat.\n\nMeanwhile, Cy-Kill attempts to get information out of Solitaire, and despite her best efforts manages to link up with Magmar and strike an alliance, turning the battle against Boulder. The good Rock Lords flee, and after their defeat at the hands of the Renegades are initially very skeptical about the Guardians' intentions when they land on Quartex. However, Nugget is able to convince Boulder and the rest of the Guardians true intentions and the two sides form an alliance.\n\nThe Renegades and Magmar soon attack in Thruster, and Leader-1 and Turbo engage in aerial combat, but receive damage that impairs their ability to fly or convert to vehicle mode. Thruster eventually withdraws on the belief that the Guardians and their allies have been wiped-out, but they survive and proceed towards the kingdom of Fossils before it is attacked. Cy-Kill and Magmar, however, strike first and seize the Fossil Lord's sceptre, leaving our heroes at a loss on what to do next.\n\nMeanwhile on Rogue Star, after Nick and A.J. escape from their cell, they free Small Foot, and the three carry out various acts of sabotage before escaping in a Renegade Spacehawk fighter. They land on Quartex and hook up with Leader-1 and the rest. Cannibalizing the fighter for all its parts, Scooter is able to construct energy projectile weapons for Boulder and his troops, and fully repairs Leader-1 and Turbo.\n\nNow ready and with the element of surprise, the allies march on Stonehead, Magmar's fort. Meanwhile, Cy-Kill finally hands Solitaire's Sceptre to Magmar to fully power his own (Boulder's sceptre, which they believed lost and was described as necessary to Magmar's goals, is all but forgotten). Once the sceptre is powered, Cy-Kill and his Renegades make their move to seize it for themselves.\n\nSolitaire, who is present to be executed, escapes in the shoot out, and rejoins Boulder and the rest as they finally crash the party. The Renegades flee with the stolen sceptre, but the Guardians pursue. Discovering that Thruster has been wrecked by the Guardians prior to their attack, Cy-Kill attempts to use Magmar's sceptre against them. But the energy discharges are too much and he is unable to control or even release his hold.\n\nA well placed shot by Leader-1 separates the two, and the Renegades finally retreat while the sceptre's power disperses. Magmar and his minions remain at large but are no longer unopposed. With their mission complete, the Guardians bid farewell to the Rock Lords and return to Gobotron.\n\n\nThe film performed poorly, pulling in about $US1.3 million domestically. When released in Australia (as \"Machine Men: Battle of the Rock Lords\", to tie in with the line's name in that territory), only a few independent cinemas carried the film, rather than the major chains. Several critics (Leonard Maltin amongst them) have incorrectly suggested that \"\" was made to \"cash in\" on the release of the film. While \"Battle of the Rock Lords\" was released five months before \"The Transformers\", the latter film had been in production for the better part of two years, well before the \"GoBots\" movie began production.\n\nThe film has been released on VHS in North America, the UK and Australia amongst others locales. It has been shown recently in 2010 on HDNet Movies. until DVD on Shout Factory over late-2019.\n\n"}
{"id": "2206569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206569", "title": "Spermine", "text": "Spermine\n\nSpermine is a polyamine involved in cellular metabolism that is found in all eukaryotic cells. The precursor for synthesis of spermine is the amino acid ornithine. It is found in a wide variety of organisms and tissues and is an essential growth factor in some bacteria. It is found as a polycation at physiological pH. Spermine is associated with nucleic acids and is thought to stabilize helical structure, particularly in viruses.\n\nCrystals of spermine phosphate were first described in 1678, in human semen, by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. The name \"spermin\" was first used by the German chemists Ladenburg and Abel in 1888, and the correct structure of spermine was not finally established until 1926, simultaneously in England (by Dudley, Rosenheim, and Starling) and Germany (by Wrede et al.). Spermine is the chemical primarily responsible for the characteristic odor of semen.\n\nA derivative of spermine, N, N-bis(ethyl)spermine (also known as BESm) was investigated in the late 1980s along with similar polyamine analogues for its potential as a cancer therapy.\n\nSpermine biosynthesis in animals starts with decarboxylation of ornithine by the enzyme Ornithine decarboxylase in the presence of PLP. This decarboxylation gives putrescine. Thereafter the enzyme spermidine synthase effects two N-alkylation by decarboxy-S-Adenosyl methionine. The intermediate is spermidine.\n\nPlants employ additional routes to spermine. In one pathway L-glutamine is the precursor to L-ornithine, after which the synthesis of spermine from L-ornithine follows the same pathway as in animals.\nAnother pathway in plants starts with decarboxylation of L-arginine to produce agmatine. The imine functional group in agmatine then is hydrolysed by agmatine deiminase, releasing ammonia, converting the guanidine group into a urea. The resultin N-carbamoylputrescine is acted on by a hydrolase to split off urea group, leaving putrescine. After that the putrescine follows the same pathway to completing the synthesis of spermine.\n\n"}
{"id": "2206580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206580", "title": "Demining", "text": "Demining\n\nDemining or mine clearance is the process of removing land mines from an area. In military operations, the object is to rapidly clear a path through a minefield, and this is often done with devices such as mine plows and blast waves. By contrast, the goal of \"humanitarian demining\" is to remove all of the landmines to a given depth and make the land safe for human use. Specially trained dogs are also used to narrow down the search and verify that an area is cleared. Mechanical devices such as flails and excavators are sometimes used to clear mines.\n\nA great variety of methods for detecting landmines have been studied. These include electromagnetic methods, one of which (ground penetrating radar) has been employed in tandem with metal detectors. Acoustic methods can sense the cavity created by mine casings. Sensors have been developed to detect vapor leaking from landmines. Animals such as rats and mongooses can safely move over a minefield and detect mines, and animals can also be used to screen air samples over potential minefields. Bees, plants and bacteria are also potentially useful. Explosives in landmines can also be detected directly using nuclear quadrupole resonance and neutron probes.\n\nDetection and removal of landmines is a dangerous activity, and personal protective equipment does not protect against all types of landmine. Once found, mines are generally defused or blown up with more explosives, but it is possible to destroy them with certain chemicals or extreme heat without making them explode.\n\nLand mines overlap with other categories of explosive devices, including unexploded ordnance (UXOs), booby traps and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). In particular, most mines are factory-built, but the definition of landmine can include \"artisanal\" (improvised) mines. Thus, the United Nations Mine Action Service includes mitigation of IEDs in its mission. Injuries from IEDs are much more serious, but factory-built landmines are longer lasting and often more plentiful. Over 1999–2016, yearly casualties from landmines and unexploded ordnance have varied between 9,228 and 3,450. In 2016, 78% of the casualties were suffered by civilians (42% by children), 20% by military and security personnel and 2% by deminers.\n\nThere are two main categories of land mine: anti-tank and anti-personnel. Anti-tank mines are designed to damage tanks or other vehicles; they are usually larger and require at least of force to trigger, so infantry will not set them off.\n\nAnti-personnel mines are designed to maim or kill soldiers. There are over 350 types, but they come in two main groups: \"blast\" and \"fragmentation\". Blast mines are buried close to the surface and triggered by pressure. A weight between , the weight of a small child, is usually enough to set one off. They are usually cylindrical with a diameter of and a height of . Fragmentation mines are designed to explode outwards, in some cases \"bounding\" upward and exploding above the ground, resulting in casualties as much as 100 metres away. Their size varies and they are mostly metal, so they are easily detected by metal detectors. However, they are normally activated by tripwires that can be up to 20 metres away from the mine, so tripwire detection is essential.\n\nThe casing of blast mines may be made of metal, wood or plastic. Some mines, referred to as minimum metal mines, are constructed with as little metal as possible – as little as – to make them difficult to detect. Common explosives used in land mines include TNT (), RDX (), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN, ), HMX () and ammonium nitrate ().\n\nLand mines are found in about 60 countries. Deminers must cope with environments that include deserts, jungles and urban environments. Antitank mines are deeply buried while antipersonnel mines are usually within 6 inches of the surface. They may be placed by hand or scattered from airplanes, in regular or irregular patterns. In urban environments, fragments of destroyed buildings may hide them; in rural environments, soil erosion may cover them or displace them. Detectors can be confused by high-metal soils and junk. Thus, demining presents a considerable engineering challenge.\n\nIn military demining, the goal is to create a safe path for troops and equipment. The soldiers who carry this out are known as combat engineers, sappers, or pioneers. Sometimes soldiers may bypass a minefield, but some bypasses are designed to concentrate advancing troops into a killing zone. If engineers need to clear a path (an operation known as \"breaching\"), they may be under heavy fire and need supporting fire to suppress it and to obscure the site with smoke. Some risk of casualties is accepted, but engineers under heavy fire may need to clear an obstacle in 7–10 minutes to avoid excessive casualties, so manual breaching may be too slow. They may need to operate in bad weather or at night. Good intelligence is needed on factors like the locations of minefields, types of mines and how they were laid, their density and pattern, ground conditions and the size and location of enemy defenses.\n\nHumanitarian demining is a component of mine action, a broad effort to reduce the social, economic and environmental damage of mines. The other \"pillars\" of mine action are risk education, victim assistance, stockpile destruction and advocacy against the use of anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions. It is done for the benefit of civilians, not the military, and the aim is to reduce risks for deminers and civilians as much as possible. In some situations, it is a necessary precondition for other humanitarian programs. Normally, a national mine action authority (NMAA) is given the primary responsibility for mine action, which it manages through a mine action center (MAC). This coordinates the efforts of other players including government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), commercial companies and the military.\n\nThe International Mine Action Standards (IMAS) provide a framework for mine action. While not legally binding in themselves, they are intended as guidelines for countries to develop their own standards. The IMAS also draw on international treaties including the Mine Ban Treaty, which has provisions for destroying stockpiles and clearing minefields.\n\nIn the 1990s, before the IMAS, the United Nations required that deminers had to clear 99.6% of all mines and explosive ordnance. However, professional deminers found that unacceptably lax because they would be responsible if any mines later harmed civilians. The IMAS call for the clearance of \"all\" mines and UXOs from a given area to a specified depth.\n\nAs of 2017, antipersonnel mines are known to contaminate 61 states and suspected in another 10. The most heavily contaminated (with more than 100 square kilometres of minefield each) are Afghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Chad, Iraq, Thailand and Turkey. Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty are required to clear all mines within 10 years of joining the treaty, and as of 2017, 28 countries had succeeded. However, several countries were not on track to meet their deadline or had requested extensions.\n\nA 2003 RAND Corporation report estimated that there are 45–50 million mines and 100,000 are cleared each year, so at present rates it would take about 500 years to clear them all. Another 1.9 million (19 more years of clearance) are added each year. However, there is a large uncertainty in the total number and the area affected. Records by armed forces are often incomplete or nonexistent, and many mines were dropped by airplane. Various natural events such as floods can move mines around and new mines continue to be laid. When minefields are cleared, the actual number of mines tends to be far smaller than the initial estimate; for example, early estimates for Mozambique were several million, but after most of the clearing had been done only 140,000 mines had been found. Thus, it may be more accurate to say that there are millions of landmines, not tens of millions.\n\nBefore minefields can be cleared, they need to be located. This begins with \"non-technical survey\", gathering records of mine placement and accidents from mines, interviewing former combatants and locals, noting locations of warning signs and unused agricultural land, and going to look at possible sites. This is supplemented by \"technical survey\", where potentially hazardous areas are physically explored to improve knowledge of their boundaries. A good survey can greatly reduce the time required to clear an area; in one study of 15 countries, less than 3 percent of the area cleared actually contained mines.\n\nBy one United Nations estimate, the cost of a landmine is between $3 and $75 while the cost of removing it is between $300 and $1000. However, such estimates may be misleading. The cost of clearance can vary considerably since it depends on the terrain, the ground cover (dense foliage makes it more difficult) and the method; and some areas that are checked for mines turn out to have none.\n\nAlthough the Mine Ban Treaty gives each state the primary responsibility to clear its own mines, other states that can help are required to do so.\nIn 2016, 31 donors (led by the United States with $152.1 million and the European Union with $73.8 million) contributed a total of $479.5 million to mine action, of which $343.2 million went to clearance and risk education. The top 5 recipient states (Iraq, Afghanistan, Croatia, Cambodia and Laos) received 54% of this support.\n\nThe conventional method of mine detection was developed in World War II and has changed little since then. It involves a metal detector, prodding instrument and tripwire feeler. Deminers clear an area of vegetation and then divide it into lanes. A deminer advances along a lane, swinging a metal detector close to the ground. When metal is detected, the deminer prods the object with a stick or stainless steel probe to determine whether it is a mine. If a mine is found, it must be deactivated.\n\nAlthough conventional demining is slow (5–150 square metres cleared per day), it is reliable, so it is still the most commonly used method. Integration with other methods such as explosive sniffing dogs can increase its reliability.\n\nDemining is a dangerous occupation. If a mine is prodded too hard or it is not detected, the deminer can suffer injury or death. The large number of false positives from metal detectors can make deminers tired and careless. According to one report, there is one such incident for every 1000–2000 mines cleared. 35 percent of the accidents occur during mine excavation and 24 percent result from missed mines.\n\nIn World War II, the primary method of locating mines was by prodding the ground with a pointed stick or bayonet. Modern tools for prodding range from a military prodder to a screwdriver or makeshift object. They are inserted at shallow angles (30 degrees or less) to probe the sides of potential mines, avoiding the triggering mechanism that is usually on top. This method requires the deminer's head and hands to be near the mine. Rakes may also be used when the terrain is soft (e.g., sandy beaches); the deminer is further away from the mine and the rake can be used to either prod or scoop up mines from beneath.\n\nMetal detectors used by deminers work on the same principles as detectors used in World War I and refined during World War II. A practical design by Polish officer Józef Kosacki, known as the Polish mine detector, was used to clear German mine fields during the Second Battle of El Alamein.\n\nAlthough metal detectors have become much lighter, more sensitive and easy to operate than the early models, the basic principle is still electromagnetic induction. Current through a wire coil produces a time-varying magnetic field that in turn induces currents in conductive objects in the ground. In turn, these currents generate a magnetic field that induces currents in a receiver coil, and the resulting changes in electric potential can be used to detect metal objects. Similar devices are used by hobbyists.\n\nNearly all mines contain enough metal to be detectable. No detector finds all mines, and the performance depends on factors such as the soil, type of mine and depth of burial. An international study in 2001 found that the most effective detector found 91 percent of the test mines in clay soil but only 71 percent in iron-rich soil. The worst detector found only 11 percent even in clay soils. The results can be improved by multiple passes.\n\nAn even greater problem is the number of false positives. Minefields contain many other fragments of metal, including shrapnel, bullet casings, and metallic minerals. 100–1000 such objects are found for every real mine. The greater the sensitivity, the more false positives. The Cambodian Mine Action Centre found that, over a six-year period, 99.6 percent of the time (a total of 23 million hours) was spent digging up scrap.\n\nThat dogs can smell landmines was first demonstrated in the 1970s. They are up to a million times more sensitive to chemicals than humans, but their true capability is unknown because they can sense explosives at lower concentrations than the best chemical detectors. Well-trained mine-detection dogs (MDDs) can sniff out explosive chemicals like TNT, monofilament lines used in tripwires, and metallic wire used in booby traps and mines. The area they can clear ranges from a few hundred to a thousand meters per day, depending on several factors. In particular, an unfavorable climate or thick vegetation can impede them, and they can get confused if there is too high a density of mines. The detection rate is also variable, so the International Mine Action Standards require an area to be covered by two dogs before it can be declared safe.\nPreferred breeds for MDDs are the German Shepherd and Belgian Malinois, although some Labrador Retrievers and Beagles are used. They cost about $10,000 each to train. This cost includes 8–10 weeks of initial training. Another 8–10 weeks is needed in the country where the dog is deployed to accustom the dog to its handler, the soil and climate, and the type of explosives.\n\nMDDs were first deployed in Afghanistan, which still has one of the largest programs. Over 900 are used in 24 countries. Their preferred role is for verifying that an area is cleared and narrowing down the region to be searched. They are also used in Remote Explosive Scent Tracing (REST). This involves collecting air samples from stretches of land about 100 meters long and having dogs or rats sniff them to determine whether the area needs clearing.\n\nMechanical demining makes use of vehicles with devices such as tillers, flails, rollers, and excavation. Used for military operations as far back as World War I, they were initially \"cumbersome, unreliable and under-powered\", but have been improved with additional armor, safer cabin designs, reliable power trains, Global Positioning System logging systems and remote control. They are now primarily used in humanitarian demining for technical surveys, to prepare the ground (removing vegetation and tripwires), and to detonate explosives.\n\nTiller systems consist of a heavy drum fitted with teeth or bits that are intended to destroy or detonate mines to a given depth. However, mines can be forced downwards or collected in a \"bow wave\" in front of the roller. They have trouble with steep slopes, wet conditions and large stones; light vegetation improves the performance, but thicker vegetation inhibits it. Flails, first used on Sherman tanks, have an extended arm with a rotating drum to which are attached chains with weights on the end. The chains act like swinging hammers. The strike force is enough to set off mines, smash them to pieces, damage the firing mechanism or throw the mine up. A blast shield protects the driver and the cabin is designed to deflect projectiles. Mine flail effectiveness can approach 100% in ideal conditions, but clearance rates as low as 50–60% have been reported.\n\nFirst used in World War I with tanks, rollers are designed to detonate mines; blast-resistant vehicles with steel wheels, such as the Casspir, serve a similar purpose. However, those used in humanitarian demining cannot withstand the blast from an anti-tank mine, so their use must be preceded by careful surveying. Unlike flails and tillers, they only destroy functioning mines, and even those do not always explode.\n\nExcavation, the removal of soil to a given depth, is done using modified construction vehicles such as bulldozers, excavators, front-end loaders, tractors and soil sifters. Armor plates and reinforced glass are added. Removed soil is sifted and inspected. It can also be fed through an industrial rock crusher, which is robust enough to withstand blasts from antipersonnel mines. Excavation is a reliable way of clearing an area to a depth that other mechanical systems cannot reach, and it has been used in several countries. In particular, the HALO Trust estimates that their excavation program destroys mines about 7 times faster than manual deminers.\n\nA 2004 study by the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining concluded that the data on the performance of mechanical demining systems was poor, and perhaps as a result, they were not being used as the primary clearance system (with the exception of excavators). However, by 2014, confidence in these systems had increased to the point where some deminers were using them as primary clearance systems.\n\nMechanical demining techniques have some challenges. In steep, undulating terrain they may skip over some of the ground. Operators can be endangered by defective mines or mines with delay charges that detonate after the blast shield has passed over; shaped charge mines that are capable of piercing most armor; and intelligent mines that are off to the side and use a variety of sensors to decide when to fire a rocket at an armored vehicle. One answer is to use remote controlled vehicles such as the Caterpillar D7 MCAP (United States) and the Caterpillar D9 (Israel).\nDespite advances in mine detection technology, \"mine detection boils down to rows of nervous people wearing blast-resistant clothing and creeping laboriously across a field, prodding the ground ahead to check for buried objects.\" Often, especially when the soil is hard, they unwittingly apply too much force and risk detonating a mine. Prodders have been developed that provide feedback on the amount of force.\n\nUniversities, corporations and government bodies have been developing a great variety of methods for detecting mines. However, it is difficult to compare their performance. One quantitative measure is a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which measures the tradeoff between false positives and false negatives. Ideally, there should be a high probability of detection with few false positives, but such curves have not been obtained for most of the technologies. Also, even if field tests were available for all technologies, they may not be comparable because performance depends on a myriad of factors, including the size, shape and composition of the mines; their depth and orientation; the type of explosive; environmental conditions; and performance of human operators. Most field tests have taken place in conditions that favor the performance of the technology, leading to overestimates of their performance.\n\nGround-penetrating radar (GPR) probes the ground using radar. A GPR device emits radio waves; these waves are reflected at discontinuities in permittivity and one or more antennae pick up the return signal. The signal is analyzed to determine the shapes and locations of the reflectors. Discontinuities occur between materials with different dielectric constants such as a landmine, a rock and soil. Unlike metal detectors, GPR devices can detect nonmetallic mine casings. However, radio waves have wavelengths that are comparable to the dimensions of landmines, so the images have low resolution. The wavelength can be varied; smaller wavelengths give better image quality but cannot penetrate as far into the soil. This tradeoff in performance depends on soil properties and other environmental factors as well as the properties of the mines. In particular, attenuation in wet soils can make it difficult to spot mines deeper than 4 centimetres, while low-frequency radar will \"bounce\" off small plastic mines near the surface. Although GPR is a mature technology for other applications such as searching for archaeological artifacts, the effect of those factors on mine detection is still not adequately understood, and GPR is not widely used for demining.\n\nGPR can be used with a metal detector and data-fusion algorithms to greatly reduce the false alarms generated by metallic clutter. One such dual-sensor device, the Handheld Standoff Mine Detection System (HSTAMIDS) became the standard mine detector of the U.S. Army in 2006. For humanitarian demining, it was tested in Cambodia for a variety of soil conditions and mine types, detecting 5,610 mines and correctly identifying 96.5% of the clutter. Another dual detector developed by ERA Technology, the Cobham VMR3 Minehound, had similar success in Bosnia, Cambodia and Angola. These dual-sensor devices are relatively light and cheap, and the HALO Trust has begun to deploy more of them around the world.\n\nSoil absorbs radiation from the Sun and is heated, with a resulting change in the infrared radiation that it emits. Landmines are better insulators than soil. As a result, the soil overhead tends to heat faster during the day and cool faster at night. Thermography uses infrared sensors to detect anomalies in the heating and cooling cycle. The effect can be enhanced using a heat source. The act of burying a mine also affects the soil properties, with small particles tending to collect near the surface. This tends to suppress the frequency-dependent characteristics that are evident in the larger particles. Hyperspectral imaging, which senses dozens of frequency bands ranging from visible light to long-wave infrared, can detect this effect. Finally, polarized light reflecting off man-made materials tend to remain polarized while natural materials depolarize it; the difference can be seen using a polarimeter.\n\nThe above methods can be used from a safe distance, including on airborne platforms. The detector technology is well developed and the main challenge is to process and interpret the images. The algorithms are underdeveloped and have trouble coping with the extreme dependence of performance on environmental conditions. Many of the surface effects are strongest just after the mine is buried and are soon removed by weathering.\n\nElectrical impedance tomography (EIT) maps out the electrical conductivity of the ground using a two-dimensional grid of electrodes. Pairs of electrodes receive a small current and the resulting voltages measured on the remaining electrodes. The data are analyzed to construct a map of the conductivity. Both metallic and non-metallic mines will show up as anomalies. Unlike most other methods, EIT works best in wet conditions, so it serves as a useful complement to them. However, the electrodes must be planted in the ground, which risks setting off a mine, and it can only detect mines near the surface.\n\nIn X-ray backscatter, an area is irradiated with X-rays (photons with wavelengths between 0.01 and 10 nanometres) and detecting the photons that are reflected back. Metals strongly absorb x-rays and little is reflected back, while organic materials absorb little and reflect a lot. Methods that use collimators to narrow the beams are not suitable for demining because the collimators are heavy and high-power sources are required. The alternative is to use wide beams and deconvolve the signal using spatial filters. The medical industry has driven improvements in x-ray technology, so portable x-ray generators are available. In principle, the short wavelength would allow high-resolution images, but it may take too long because the intensity must be kept low to limit exposure of humans to the radiation. Also, only mines less than 10 centimetres deep would be imaged.\n\nA buried mine will almost always leak explosives through the casing. 95 percent of this will be adsorbed by the soil, but the other 5 percent will mostly dissolve in water and be transported away. If it gets to the surface, it leaves a chemical signature. TNT biodegrades within a few days in soil, but an impurity, 2,4-Dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), lasts much longer and has a high vapor pressure. Thus, it is the primary target for chemical detection. However, the concentrations are very small, particularly in dry conditions. A reliable vapor detection system needs to detect 10 grams of 2,4-DNT per millilitre of air in very dry soil or 10 grams per millilitre in moist soil. Biological detectors are very effective, but some chemical sensors are being developed.\n\nHoney bees can be used to locate mines in two ways: passive sampling and active detection. In passive sampling, their mop-like hairs, which are electrostatically charged, collect a variety of particles including chemicals leaking from explosives. The chemicals are also present in water that they bring back and air that they breathe. Methods such as solid phase microextraction, sorbent sol-gels, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry can be used to identify explosive chemicals in the hive.\n\nHoney bees can also be trained, in 1–2 days, to associate the smell of an explosive with food. In field trials, they detected concentrations of parts per trillion with a detection probability of 97–99 percent and false positives of less than 1 percent. When targets were placed consisting of small amounts of 2.4-DNT mixed with sand, they detect vapor plumes from the source several meters away and follow them to the source. Bees make thousands of foraging flights per day, and over time high concentrations of bees occur over targets. The most challenging issue is tracking them when a bee can fly 3–5 kilometres before returning to the hive. However, tests using lidar (a laser scanning technique) have been promising.\n\nBees do not fly at night, in heavy rain or wind, or in temperatures below , but the performance of dogs is also limited under these conditions. So far, most tests have been conducted in dry conditions in open terrain, so the effect of vegetation is not known. Tests have commenced in real minefields in Croatia and the results are promising, although after about three days the bees must be retrained because they are not getting food rewards from the mines.\n\nLike dogs, giant pouched rats are being trained to sniff out chemicals like TNT in landmines. A Belgian NGO, APOPO, trains rats in Tanzania at a cost of $6000 per rat. These rats, nicknamed \"HeroRATS\", have been deployed in Mozambique and Cambodia. APOPO credits the rats with clearing more than 100,000 mines.\n\nRats have the advantage of being far lower mass than the human or dogs, so they are less likely to set off mines. They are just smart enough to learn repetitive tasks but not smart enough to get bored; and unlike dogs, they do not bond with their trainers, so they are easier to transfer between handlers. They have far fewer false positives than metal detectors, which detect any form of metal, so in a day they can cover an area that would take a metal detector two weeks.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, dogs are an expensive option for mine detection because they cannot be trained locally. The Sri Lankan Army Corps of Engineers has been conducting research on the use of the mongoose for mine detection, with promising initial results. Engineer Thrishantha Nanayakkara and colleagues at the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka have been developing a method where a mongoose is guided by a remote-controlled robot.\n\nDuring the Angolan Civil War, elephants fled to neighboring countries. After the war ended in 2002, they started returning, but Angola was littered with millions of landmines. A biologist noticed that the elephants soon learned to avoid them. In a study in South Africa, researchers found that some elephants could detect TNT samples with a high sensitivity, missing only one out of 97 samples. They were 5% more likely to indicate the presence of TNT than dogs, but 6% less likely to miss a sample (the more important measure of success). While researchers do not plan to send elephants to minefields, they could sniff samples collected by unmanned vehicles in a preliminary screening of potential minefields.\n\n\"Thale cress\", a member of the mustard family and one of the best-studied plants in the world, normally turns red under harsh conditions. But using a combination of natural mutations and genetic manipulation, scientists from Danish biotechnology company Aresa Biodetection created a strain that only changes color in response to nitrate and nitrite, chemicals that are released when TNT breaks down. The plants would aid demining by indicating the presence of mines through color change, and could either be sown from aircraft or by people walking through demined corridors in minefields. In September 2008, Aresa Biodetection ceased development of the method, but in 2012 a group at Cairo University announced plans for large-scale testing of a method that would combine detection using \"Arabidopsis\" with bacteria that would corrode metal in mines and rose periwinkle, sugar beet or tobacco plants that would absorb nitrogen from the TNT that was released.\n\nAn inherent problem with sensing nitrate and nitrites is that they are already in the soil naturally. There are no natural chemical sensors for TNT, so some researchers are attempting to modify existing receptors so they respond to TNT-derived chemicals that do not occur naturally.\n\nA bacterium, known as a bioreporter, has been genetically engineered to fluoresce under ultraviolet light in the presence of TNT. Tests involving spraying such bacteria over a simulated minefield successfully located mines. In the field, this method could allow for searching hundreds of acres in a few hours, which is much faster than other techniques, and could be used on a variety of terrain types. While there are some false positives (especially near plants and water drainage), even three ounces of TNT were detectable using these bacteria. Unfortunately, there is no strain of bacteria capable of detecting RDX, another common explosive, and the bacteria may not be visible under desert conditions. Also, well-constructed munitions that have not had time to corrode may be undetectable using this method.\n\nAs part of the \"Dog's nose\" program run by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), several kinds of non-biological detectors were developed in an attempt to find a cheap alternative to dogs. These include spectroscopic, piezoelectric, electrochemical and fluorescent detectors. Of these, the fluorescent detector has the lowest detection limit. Two glass slides are coated with a fluorescent polymer. Explosive chemicals bind to the polymer and reduce the amount of fluorescent light emitted. This has been developed by Nomadics, Inc. into a commercial product, Fido, that has been incorporated in robots deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nChemical sensors can be made lightweight and portable and can operate at a walking pace. However, they do not have a 100% probability of detection, and the explosive vapors they detect have often drifted away from the source. Effects of environmental conditions are not well understood. As of 2016, dogs outperformed the best technological solutions.\n\nAlthough some of the methods for detecting explosive vapors are promising, the transport of explosive vapors through the soil is still not well understood. An alternative is to detect the bulk explosive inside a landmine by interacting with the nuclei of certain elements. In landmines, explosives contain 18–38% nitrogen by weight, 16–37% carbon and 2–3% hydrogen. By contrast, soils contain less than 0.07% nitrogen, 0.1–9% carbon and 0–50% hydrogen. Methods for interrogating the nuclei include nuclear quadrupole resonance and neutron methods. Detection can be difficult because the \"bulk\" may amount to less than 100 grams and a much greater signal may come from the surrounding earth and cosmic rays.\n\nNuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy uses radio frequency (RF) waves to determine the chemical structure of compounds. It can be regarded as nuclear magnetic resonance \"without the magnet\". The frequencies at which resonances occur are primarily determined by the quadrupole moment of the nuclear charge density and the gradient of the electric field due to valence electrons in the compound. Each compound has a unique set of resonance frequencies. Unlike a metal detector, NQR does not have false positives from other objects in the ground. Instead, the main performance issue is the low ratio of the signal to the random thermal noise in the detector. This signal-to-noise ratio can be increased by increasing the interrogation time, and in principle the probability of detection can be near unity and the probability of false alarm low. Unfortunately, the most common explosive material (TNT) has the weakest signal. Also, its resonance frequencies are in the AM radio band and can be overwhelmed by radio broadcasts. Finally, it cannot see through metal casing or detect liquid explosives. Nevertheless, it is considered a promising technology for confirming results from other scanners with a low false alarm rate.\n\nSince the late 1940s, a lot of research has examined the potential of nuclear techniques for detecting landmines and there have been several reviews of the technology. According to a RAND study in 2003, \"Virtually every conceivable nuclear reaction has been examined, but ... only a few have potential for mine detection.\" In particular, reactions that emit charged particles can be eliminated because they do not travel far in the ground, and methods involving transmission of neutrons through the medium (useful in applications such as airport security) are not feasible because the detector and receiver cannot be placed on opposite sides. This leaves emission of radiation from targets and scattering of neutrons. For neutron detectors to be portable, they must be able to detect landmines efficiently with low-intensity beams so that little shielding is needed to protect human operators. One factor that determines the efficiency is the cross section of the nuclear reaction; if it is large, a neutron does not have to come as close to a nucleus to interact with it.\n\nOne possible source of neutrons is spontaneous fission from a radioactive isotope, most commonly \ncalifornium-252. Neutrons can also be generated using a portable particle accelerator (a \"sealed neutron tube\") that promotes the fusion of deuterium and tritium, producing helium-4 and a neutron. This has the advantage that tritium, being less radiotoxic than californium-252, would pose a smaller threat to humans in the event of an accident such as an explosion. These sources emit fast neutrons with an energy of 14.1 million electron volts (MeV) from the neutron tube and 0–13 MeV from californium-252. If low-energy (thermal) neutrons are needed, they must be passed through a moderator.\n\nIn one method, \"thermal neutron analysis (TNA)\", thermal neutrons are captured by a nucleus, releasing energy in the form of a gamma ray. One such reaction, nitrogen-14 captures a neutron to make nitrogen-15, releasing a gamma ray with energy 10.835 MeV. No other naturally occurring isotope emits a photon with such a high energy, and there are few transitions that emit nearly as much energy, so detectors do not need high energy resolution. Also, nitrogen has a large cross section for thermal neutrons. The Canadian Army has deployed a multi-detector vehicle, the Improved Landmine Detection System, with a TNA detector to confirm the presence of anti-tank mines that were spotted by other instruments. However, the time required to detect antipersonnel mines is prohibitively long, especially if they are deeper than a few centimeters, and a human-portable detector is considered unachievable.\n\nAn alternative neutron detector uses fast neutrons that enter the ground and are moderated by it; the flux of thermal neutrons scattered back is measured. Hydrogen is a very effective moderator of neutrons, so the signal registers hydrogen anomalies. In an antipersonnel mine, hydrogen accounts for 25–35% of the atoms in the explosive and 55–65% in the casing. Hand-held devices are feasible and several systems have been developed. However, because they are sensitive only to atoms and cannot distinguish different molecular structures, they are easily fooled by water, and are generally not useful in soils with water content over 10%. However, if a distributed pulsed neutron source is used, it may be possible to distinguish wet soil from explosives by their decay constants. A \"Timed Neutron Detector\" based on this method has been created by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and has won design awards.\n\nAcoustic/seismic methods involve creating sound waves above the ground and detecting the resulting vibrations at the surface. Usually the sound is generated by off-the-shelf loudspeakers or electrodynamic shakers, but some work has also been done with specialized ultrasound speakers that send tight beams into the ground. The measurements can be made with non-contact sensors such as microphones, radar, ultrasonic devices and laser Dopper vibrometers.\n\nA landmine has a distinctive acoustic signature because it is a container. Sound waves alternately compress and expand the enclosed volume of air and there is a lag between the volume change and the pressure that increases as the frequency decreases. The landmine and the soil above it act like two coupled springs with a nonliner response that does not depend on the composition of the container. Such a response is not seen in most other buried objects such as roots, rocks, concrete or other man-made objects (unless they are hollow items such as bottles and cans) so the detection method has few false positives.\n\nAs well as having a low false positive rate, acoustic/seismic methods respond to different physical properties than other detectors, so they could be used in tandem for a richer source of information. They are also unaffected by moisture and weather, but have trouble in frozen ground and vegetation. However, because sound attenuates in the ground, the current technology is limited to mines \"deeper than approximately one mine diameter\". It is also slow, with scans taking between 125 and 1000 seconds per square meter, but increasing the number of sensors can speed the scan up proportionately.\n\n\"Drone\" is a synonym for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system that includes the drone, the person operating the machine and the communication system is called an unmanned aerial (or aircraft) system (UAS). The FAA also uses the term small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) for small UAS. In the past decade, the use of such systems for demining has grown rapidly.\n\nDrones equipped with cameras have been used to map areas during non-technical survey, to monitor changes in land use resulting from demining, to identify patterns of mine placement and predict new locations, and to plan access routes to minefields. One such system, a fixed-wing UAV made by SenseFly, is being tested by GICHD in Angola. A Spanish company, CATUAV, equipped a drone with optical sensors to scan potential minefields in Bosnia and Herzegovina; their design was a finalist in the 2015 Drones for Good competition. From February to October 2019, Humanity & Inclusion, an international NGO, is testing drones for non-technical survey in northern Chad.\n\nSeveral ideas for detecting landmines are in the research and development phase. A research team at the University of Bristol is working on adding multispectral imaging (for detecting chemical leaks) to drones. Geophysicists at Binghamton University are testing the use of thermal imaging to locate \"butterfly mines\", which were dropped from airplanes in Afghanistan and mostly sit on the surface. At DTU Space, an institute in the Technical University of Denmark, researchers are designing a drone with magnetometer suspended underneath it, with the initial goal of clearing mines from World War II so power cables can be connected to offshore wind turbines.\n\nThe Dutch Mine Kafon project, led by designer Massoud Hassani, is working on an autonomous drone called the Mine Kafon Drone. It uses robotic attachments in a three-step process. First, a map is generated using a 3-D camera and GPS. Next, a metal detector pinpoints the location of mines. Finally, a robotic gripping arm places a detonator above each mine and the drone triggers it from a distance.\n\nDrone programs must overcome challenges such as getting permission to fly, finding safe takeoff and landing spots, and getting access to electricity for charging the batteries. In addition, there are concerns about privacy, and a danger that drones could be weaponized by hostile forces.\n\nDeminers may be issued personal protective equipment (PPE) such as helmets, visors, armoured gloves, vests and boots, in an attempt to protect them if a mine is set off by accident. The IMAS standards require that some parts of the body (including the chest, abdomen, groin and eyes) be protected against a blast from 240 grams of TNT at a distance of 60 centimeters; head protection is recommended. Although it says blast resistant boots may be used, the benefits are unproven and the boots may instill a false sense of security.\n\nThe recommended equipment can afford significant protection against antipersonnel blast mines, but the IMAS standards acknowledge that they are not adequate for fragmentation and antitank mines. Heavier armor is heavier and more uncomfortable, and there is an increased likelihood that deminers will not wear the equipment. Other ways of managing risk include better detectors, remote-controlled vehicles to remove fragmentation mines, long-handled rakes for excavation and unmanned aerial vehicles to scout the hazards before approaching.\n\nOnce a mine is found, the most common methods of removing it are to manually defuse it (a slow and dangerous process) or blow it up with more explosives (dangerous and costly). Research programs have explored alternatives that destroy the mine without exploding it, using chemicals or heat.\n\nThe most common explosive material, TNT, is very stable, not burnable with a match and highly resistant to acids or common oxidizing agents. However, some \nchemicals use an autocatalytic reaction to destroy it. Diethylenetriamine (DETA) and TNT spontaneously ignite when they come in contact with each other. One delivery system involves a bottle of DETA placed over a mine; a bullet shot through both brings them in contact and the TNT is consumed within minutes. Other chemicals that can be used for this purpose include pyridine, diethylamine and pyrole. They do not have the same effect on explosives such as RDX and PETN.\n\nThermal destruction methods generate enough heat to burn TNT. One uses leftover rocket propellant from the NASA Space Shuttle missions. Thiokol, the company that built the engines for the shuttles, developed a flare with the propellant. Placed next to a mine and activated remotely, it reaches temperatures exceeding , burning a hole through the landmine casing and consuming the explosive. These flares have been used by the US Navy in Kosovo and Jordan. Another device uses a solid state reaction to create a liquid that penetrates the case and starts the explosive burning.\n\nIn World War II, one method that the German SS used to clear minefields was to chase captured civilians across them. More humane methods included mine plows, mounted on Sherman and Churchill tanks, and the Bangalore Torpedo. Variants of these are still used today.\n\nMine plows use a specially designed shovel to unearth mines and shove them to the side, clearing a path. They are quick and effective for clearing a lane for vehicles and are still attached to some types of tank and remotely operated vehicles. The mines are moved but not deactivated, so mine plows are not used for humanitarian demining.\n\nThe mine-clearing line charge, successor to the Bangalore torpedo, clears a path through a minefield by triggering the mines with a blast wave. This can also be done using the Anti-personnel obstacle breaching system or Giant Viper, a hose-pipe filled with explosives and carried across a minefield by a rocket.\n\nAlong the China-Vietnam border are numerous minefields. These are the legacy of border clashes in the 1980s. The mines are mainly anti-personnel, and have kept large areas of arable land from use by local farmers. A typical demining process deployed by the Chinese is as follows. Firebreaks are dug around the minefield to be cleared. Then engineers would set the minefield on fire with flamethrowers. Key factors of this burning process are: thick vegetation covering the minefields; most anti-personnel mines are buried very close to the ground level; the mines are made of mostly either wood, thin metal or plastic. This burning process would usually destroy about 90% of the mines, as the mines are either detonated or melted. Mines which have trip wires would have these wires burned off. Demining teams then would plow the area with mine detectors. When the teams have cleared the mines, they would walk over the field hand in hand themselves to show to the locals that all the mines have been cleared.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2206586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206586", "title": "Peter Wong (Australian politician)", "text": "Peter Wong (Australian politician)\n\nPeter Hon Jung Wong () (born 12 October 1942) is an Australian politician. A prominent figure in the Sydney Chinese community and former member of the Liberal Party of Australia, he became concerned over the Liberal Party's refusal to oppose strongly the rise of Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party, and ultimately went on to found the Unity Party. He served as their leader from 1998 to 1999 and represented the party in the New South Wales Legislative Council from March 1999 until March 2007.\n\nWong was born in China, but his Hakka family fled from that Communist Party-controlled country when he was eight. His family briefly settled in Borneo, where his father provided free medical care to the poor, but they later moved on to Sydney, Australia. Wong ultimately studied medicine at the University of Sydney and went into private practice, working as a general practitioner in Sydney for many years. He became actively involved in the Chinese Australian community, which saw him appointed as a member of the Ethnic Affairs Commission from 1991 to 1997.\n\nWong became extensively involved in community work; amongst other things, he founded the Chinese Catholic Community, co-founded the Chinese Charity Foundation and served as chair of the Chinese Migrant Welfare Association. He also co-founded the Welfare Committee for Chinese Students in 1990 and through it played a role in the Hawke government's eventual decision to give asylum to 42,000 Chinese university students after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Through his work with these organisations, Wong often oversaw the provision of assistance to newly arrived migrants and the underprivileged in the Sydney Chinese community and acted as a spokesperson for the community in the media.\n\nWong was an active member of the Liberal Party of Australia for many years. He served as secretary of the party's Chinatown branch, acted as an advisor to Philip Ruddock and was a prominent supporter of federal MP Brendan Nelson and prominent candidate for Lord Mayor of Sydney Kathryn Greiner. However, after the 1996 federal election and 1998 Queensland state election, Wong became increasingly concerned about the rising popularity of controversial right-wing federal MP Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party, who had run on a platform of reducing Asian immigration. When the Liberal Party did little to stop the growth of the Hanson movement and made clear their intention to preference One Nation over the opposition Australian Labor Party, Wong made his concern public, though he kept it relatively muted.\n\nWhen the Liberal Party continued to insist on preferencing Hanson, Wong joined a number of Chinese community leaders in campaigning against the preference decision. Wong continued to be dissatisfied with the Liberal response, and on 24 June, he publicly resigned from the party, angrily criticising the party's refusal to more strongly oppose Hanson. His remarks received media attention, which was further amplified when Helen Sham-Ho, a Chinese Australian Liberal member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, also resigned from the party several days later.\n\nWith the 1998 election looming on the horizon, Wong initially planned to stand as an independent candidate. However, he was persuaded to look at starting a separate political party with the specific aim of opposing Hanson and promoting multiculturalism. Weeks of discussions with other ethnic leaders around the nation followed, and the result, the result, the Unity Party, was announced on 3 July 1998, with Wong as its first convener - in effect, leader.\n\nWong quickly set about finding candidates and members, as well as setting up branches in other states, and the new party saw rapid growth. He was particularly insistent that the new party must be multicultural, instead of representing one or two ethnic groups, and broke with Sham-Ho over the issue. For this reason, it was initially intended to find a non-Asian leader to broaden the party's appeal in advance of the 1998 federal election, but this never occurred, and Wong led the party into the election. While the Unity Party was notably liberal on race issues, Wong's conservatism was evident in their policies against abortion and voluntary euthanasia.\n\nWong chose not to run for office himself at the federal election, but the party fielded candidates in 72 of the 148 electorates. They fell well short of having any members elected, but had outpolled the Australian Democrats and Australian Greens in some lower house seats - although their main Senate ticket was nearly outpolled by the Christian Democratic Party in primary votes. With the election over, Wong and the Unity Party then turned their attention to the 1999 New South Wales state election, where the party had a greater chance of gaining representation in parliament, as their core base lay in the state.\n\nWhile he had not contested the federal election, Wong decided to run for the New South Wales Legislative Council at the state election, and took first place on the Unity Party ticket. With the threat from Pauline Hanson and One Nation largely gone, much of their original focus had changed, but Wong oversaw a change in party policy, focusing more on issues of multiculturalism and social justice. Wong's campaign gained significant publicity in Chinese-language newspapers and was often quoted in the mainstream media during the campaign.\n\nHowever, only weeks before the election, a string of founding members resigned over Wong's decision to preference several right-wing parties despite having done little consultation with other members, and many of them also demanded that Wong resign as leader. This caused significant fallout for Wong and the Unity Party, and he subsequently polled only 1% of the vote on election day. Despite this, he still managed to win a seat in the Legislative Council, as due to an unusual effect of the electoral system, he managed to pick up a solid flow of preferences from other parties, several of whom were ideologically opposed to the Unity Party.\n\nHis election with such a low proportion of the vote - along with two others who gained less than 1% - caused some controversy and sparked a major overhaul of the state's electoral laws. He soon resigned as leader of the Unity Party in order to concentrate on his parliamentary responsibilities, and while he remained actively involved in the party, subsequently had little to do with their affairs outside of New South Wales.\n\nAs a member of the Legislative Council, Wong generally tended to concentrate on ethnic and migrant issues. He attempted to minimise the influence of One Nation-turned-independent MLC David Oldfield, who argued for the elimination of all forms of government support for multiculturalism. He was often a spokesperson for the Chinese community in parliament, most often during an organised crime war involving Sydney's Chinatown in 2003 and during a government attempt to regulate the use of MSG in restaurants, which Wong successfully lobbied against after a wave of concern from Chinese restaurants.\n\nWong was sharply critical of policies he viewed as being anti-migrant, as seen when he strongly opposed the Carr government's decision to change the name of the Ethnic Affairs Commission to the Community Relations Commission - a move which he blamed on appeasing Pauline Hanson's supporters. He also attacked examples of what he perceives to be racist stereotyping, such as Premier Bob Carr's introduction of racial profiling in 2003, and comments by Carr that he blamed for inciting aggression against ethnic minorities in the wake of the Sydney gang rapes and a spate of other incidents involving gang-related crime.\n\nWhile Wong had been known as a conservative when he was in the Liberal Party, he often espoused traditionally left-wing viewpoints in the Legislative Council. He voted to lower the age of consent for male homosexual sex, opposed the mandatory detention of refugees, often visiting detainees in Villawood Detention Centre and came out strongly against the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He has also been a vocal defender of the Palestinian people; a stance that caused Wong some controversy when Alan Jacobs, the Unity Party's national president, resigned and stormed out on the party after hearing him make anti-Israel comments in the Legislative Council. Jacobs also repeatedly accused Wong of being homophobic, though he provided no evidence of this. Voluntary euthanasia was the only marked exception to his otherwise generally liberal voting record; Wong strongly opposed it, and vocally campaigned against a failed attempt by the Greens to legalise voluntary euthanasia in New South Wales.\n\nWong had a number of major successes while in Parliament such as achieving the inquiry into Kariong Juvenile Justice Centre, stopping the major grocery companies expanding into drug sales as chemists, and was instrumental in bringing about the moratorium on genetically modified crop trials in NSW.\n\nHis work assisting Sydney Harbour fishermen led to the full closure of commercial fisheries in Port Jackson; the Government buyback of commercial fishing licences, a $5 million compensation package and the testing of the 44 commercial fishermen and their families for dioxin contamination.\n\nThe NSW Government also announced a massive additional cleanup of the sediments of Homebush Bay.\n\nDr. Wong was also a vocal champion for children in the care of the State (State wards), attempting unsuccessfully to have government address their massive overrepresentation in the juvenile and adult prison systems in NSW.\n\nDr. Wong's eight-year term expired in March 2007. He did not recontest his seat at the March NSW State election, and his party failed in their bid to secure his seat, achieving only 1.2% of the vote. Wong has been the only Unity representative to date to have secured a seat in an Australian parliament.\n\n"}

The line is notable in that units were offered with either an Alpha AXP or Intel Pentium processor as the CPU, and most hardware other than the backplane and CPU were interchangeable. Both the Alpha and Intel versions were intended to run Windows NT.\n\nThe Multia had a compact case that left little room for expansion cards and restricted air flow, which can cause premature hardware failure due to overheating if not properly cared for. Enthusiasts remedy this by placing the Multia vertically instead of horizontally, allowing the heated air to escape via vents at the top, although this still requires preventing the Multia from overheating due to other factors, e.g. environmental.\n\nThe Alpha Multias included either an Alpha 21066 or Alpha 21066A microprocessor running at 166 MHz or 233 MHz respectively, and came with 16 or 24 MB of RAM as standard (expandable to 128 MB officially, but in practice 256 MB). Because the 21066 was a budget version of the Alpha 21064 processor, it had a narrower (64-bit versus 128-bit) and slower bus and thus performance was roughly equivalent to a Pentium running at 100 MHz for integer operations, but superior in floating-point; furthermore, the standard RAM capacity was a severe restriction on the performance of these workstations. The Alpha-based Multias came with the TGA (DEC 21030) graphics adapter.\n\nStandard peripherals on both Alpha and Intel models included a SCSI host adapter, DEC 21040 Ethernet controller, two PCMCIA slots, two RS-232 ports, a bi-directional parallel port, a 2.5 in or 3.5 in SCSI or ATA hard disk (340 MB to 1.6 GB), PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, and a PCI slot (on models with 2.5-inch hard disks).\n\nMultia models comprised:\n\n\nIn 1996, Digital began offering the Alpha Multia without Windows NT and renamed the line the \"Universal Desktop Box\" (nicknamed \"UDB\"). Prices were quite low, such that for the first time many enthusiasts and hobbyists could afford an Alpha AXP-based computer. The Multia or UDB can run Windows NT for Alpha through Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (although Windows 2000 was never officially released for the Alpha platform, Windows 2000 Beta was released and in fact runs on the Multia), and both Linux and NetBSD are available for the Multia. Additionally, both Digital UNIX and OpenVMS can be configured to run on the Multia (with certain limitations), although initially such operating systems were disabled from running on the budget Multia line.\n\nThe Alpha-based Multia came configured with the ARC firmware console for running Windows NT, although SRM was also available. The Intel-based Multia used BIOS.\n\n\n\n"}

The brothers presented illusions that they and others claimed to be supernatural.\n\nThe Davenports began in 1854, less than a decade after Spiritualism had taken off in America. After stories of the Fox sisters, the Davenports started reporting similar occurrences. Their father took up managing his sons and the group was joined by William Fay, a Buffalo resident with an interest in conjuring. Their shows were introduced by a former \"Restoration Movement\" minister, Dr. J. B. Ferguson, a follower of Spiritualism, who assured the audience that the brothers worked by spirit power rather than deceptive trickery. Ferguson was apparently sincere in his belief that the Davenports possessed spiritual powers.\n\nThe Davenports' most famous effect was the box illusion. The brothers were tied inside a box which contained musical instruments. Once the box was closed, the instruments would sound. Upon opening the box, the brothers were tied in the positions in which they had started the illusion. Those who witnessed the effect were made to believe supernatural forces had caused the trick to work.\n\nThe Davenports toured the United States for 10 years and then traveled to England where spiritualism was beginning to become popular. Their \"spirit cabinet\" was investigated by the Ghost Club, who were challenging their claim of being able to contact the dead. The result of the Ghost Club's investigation was never made public. In 1868 the team was joined by Harry Kellar. Kellar and Fay eventually would leave the group to pursue their own career as a magician team.\n\nThe Davenport brothers were exposed as frauds many times. The stage magician John Nevil Maskelyne saw how the Davenports' spirit cabinet illusion worked, and stated to the audience in the theatre that he could recreate their act using no supernatural methods. With the help of a friend, cabinet maker George Alfred Cooke, he built a version of the cabinet. Together, they revealed the Davenport Brothers' trickery to the public at a show in Cheltenham in June 1865.\n\nMagicians including John Henry Anderson and Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin worked to expose the Davenport Brothers, writing exposés and performing duplicate effects. A pair of amateur magicians followed the brothers around Britain, tying the Davenports into their box with a knot that could not be easily removed and thus exposed the trick to audiences who demanded their money back. The impresario P. T. Barnum included an exposé of the Davenports in his 1865 book \"The Humbugs of the World\".\n\nThe Davenports were rejoined by William Fay for a final American tour before William Henry's death in 1877. Fay settled in Australia and Ira Erastus lived in America until the two reunited in 1895 and toured with a show that failed.\n\nThe magician John Mulholland also exposed the tricks of the Davenport brothers:\n\nA number of things immediately become less miraculous when it is known at times the Davenports employed as many as ten confederates. It was a night when a confederate was used that Alexander Herrmann (the stage magician known as Herrmann the Great) described in an article in the \"Cosmopolitan Magazine\". The performance was being given in Ithaca, New York, and many Cornell College students were in the audience. They had brought \"pyrotechnic balls so made as to ignite suddenly with bright light.\" When the lights were struck the Davenports were found to be on opposite sides of the stage waving musical instruments around in the air.\n\nAccording to the magician Harry Houdini, Ira had confessed to him that he and his brother had faked their \"spirit\" phenomena. Houdini in his book \"A Magician Amongst the Spirits\" (1924) also reproduced a letter from Ira claiming \"we never in public affirmed our Belief in spiritualism.\" The spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle refused to accept the exposures of fraud, and insisted that in private Ira was a practicing spiritualist.\n\nIn 1998, skeptical investigator Joe Nickell discovered the Davenports' scrapbook from the museum at the Lily Dale Spiritualist Assembly. Nickell examined newspaper clippings, personal notes and photographs from the scrapbook. He concluded that Doyle was correct about Ira endorsing spiritualism in private and Houdini was also correct about their public \"spirit\" phenomena being the result of trickery. According to Nickell \"taken as a whole, the evidence of the scrapbook does indicate that Ira Davenport was a practicing spiritualist, or at least pretended to be, although he and his brother used trickery to accomplish the effects they attributed to spirits.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2206599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206599", "title": "Jens Voigt", "text": "Jens Voigt\n\nJens Voigt () (born 17 September 1971) is a German former professional road bicycle racer and, upon retirement, became a cycling sports broadcast commentator. During his cycling career, Voigt raced for several teams, the last one being UCI ProTeam . Voigt wore the yellow jersey of the Tour de France twice, though he was never a contender for the overall title owing to the mountainous nature of the stages of the race being better suited to climbing specialists. His career achievements include winning the Critérium International a record-tying 5 times and a number of one-week stage races, as well as two Tour de France stage victories. In September 2014, he set a new hour record.\n\nAmong cycling fans, Voigt was generally popular, both for his aggressive riding style and his affable, forthright and articulate manners in dealing with the public and media. He speaks fluent French and English, in addition to his native German.\n\nVoigt was born in Grevesmühlen, now in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, then in East Germany, about 100 km north-east of Hamburg, in the same area as Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich. Voigt was encouraged by his parents to participate in sports, since he often got into trouble as a youngster thanks to his excessive energy. His early performance indicated he had good endurance potential, and he joined a national sports school at age 14 and trained in cycling and track and field.\n\nVoigt won the Peace Race in 1994 and topped the UCI \"Challenge Mondial Amateurs\" rankings in December 1994. After a four-year stint in the German Army, much of it spent with a special sports unit, he started professional cycling in 1997, winning races for the Australian team ZVVZ-Giant-Australian Institute of Sport.\n\nIn 1998, with the support of his former Australian Institute of Sport Sports Director, German-born Heiko Salzwedel, he moved to the big French team (which became ) where he spent the five years amassing 20 wins, among them a day in the maillot jaune in the 2001 Tour de France and a stage in that same Tour. Voigt played a part in Jan Ullrich's 2000 Olympic Games win for the German team.\n\nIn 2004, Voigt joined his former Crédit Agricole teammate Bobby Julich with a move to . Being tempo specialists, they formed a strong pair as they dominated the 2004 and 2005 LuK Challenge race, a two-man time trial.\n\nVoigt rode the 2004 Tour de France for Team CSC captain Ivan Basso. Voigt and teammate Jakob Piil were often in breakaways, covering the break for CSC. On the 15th stage, Voigt was in a break as Ullrich attacked up the Col de l'Echarasson, leaving race leader Lance Armstrong and second-placed Basso. With Armstrong's team unable to pull Ullrich back in, Voigt was ordered back from his breakaway to help Basso defend his place. Voigt saw Ullrich ride past as he waited for his captain, before he single-handedly closed the gap to Ullrich. Next day was a time trial up the Alpe d'Huez with 900,000 spectators at the roadside. Voigt was heckled by German fans calling him \"Judas\" for his effort to ruin fellow German Ullrich's chances. Voigt criticised German TV-channel ARD for starting a witch-hunt against him and pleaded that he was paid by Team CSC, not Germany and that (as he stated in the documentary \"Overcoming\") thanks to his help, Ullrich won his olympic gold medal in 2000.\n\nAt the start of 2005, Voigt won the Tour Méditerranéen, ahead of teammates Fränk Schleck 2nd and Nicki Sørensen 4th. Voigt won the first UCI ProTour event, the prologue time trial of the 2005 Paris–Nice, a race Bobby Julich won overall. Voigt nearly won the 2005 classic Liège–Bastogne–Liège when he was beaten on the line by Alexander Vinokourov, Voigt having been on a breakaway almost the entire race.\nAfter a strong placing in the stage 1 time trial of the 2005 Tour de France, Voigt was only trailing race leader Armstrong by 1 minute and he tried hard to take the overall lead. He took part in many attacks, before the first rest day on the 9th stage, he finally got in a break-away that lasted to the line. He finished third, 3 minutes ahead of Armstrong. Voigt's time in the maillot jaune would be short-lived however, as he fell to 168th at stage 10 after a fever, and he was eliminated for failing to finish stage 11 within the time limit. Voigt ended 2005 as 29th on the UCI ProTour individual rankings.\nThe 2006 season started at a slower pace for Voigt compared to 2005 in order to save energy and be in a position to help Basso in his quest to win the 2006 Giro d'Italia and 2006 Tour de France races. His only result until the Giro in May was an attack on the fifth stage of the Tour of the Basque Country, but he had to settle for second behind stage winner Thomas Voeckler.\n\nFor the Giro d'Italia, Voigt rode in support of Basso. Following Team CSC's team time trial win on stage 5, Voigt found himself second, trailing race leader Serhiy Honchar by six seconds. During the first mountains, Voigt helped Basso take the overall lead, while he slid down the board and finished 37th. On mountainous stage 19, Voigt and Julich were in a 20-man break, but as Team CSC was leading the peloton to defend Basso's first place, Voigt and Julich did not work. Up the last climb, Voigt was alone with Spanish rider Juan Manuel Gárate, but as Voigt did not think he had done enough to deserve the victory, he let Garate take the win. Voigt finally got his first win of the season in the Ster Elektrotoer race in June. There he won stage 4 and helped teammate Kurt Asle Arvesen to the overall win, two weeks before the Tour de France.\nIn the days before the Tour, Basso was suspended by Team CSC after his name had been brought up in the Operación Puerto doping investigation. Carlos Sastre became team captain. Voigt took the role of early attacker, to lessen the load for the team, and he formed or joined unsuccessful breakaways on several stages. On the memorable stage 13 from Béziers to Montélimar, the longest stage of the 2006 Tour at 231 km, Voigt got in a five-man breakaway which finished 29 minutes and 58 seconds ahead of the main bunch. At the line, Voigt outsprinted Óscar Pereiro to take his second Tour stage win. On stage 15, Voigt helped Fränk Schleck from Luxembourg, pulling hard in the break with teammate David Zabriskie of the US, which eventually gave Schleck the win. Voigt finished the 2006 Tour 53rd, helping Sastre finish 4th.\n\nIn February 2007, Voigt won the third stage of the Tour of California, which had numerous climbs. After the bunch caught 17 escapees, Levi Leipheimer of attacked, and only Chris Horner () and Voigt could keep up with him. Voigt ultimately prevailed in the sprint over the two men and approached to only 3 seconds behind Leipheimer for the General Classification thanks to time bonuses. He managed to hold on to his second place over the next 4 stages, finishing 21 seconds behind the winner of the Tour, Leipheimer. In April, he met another success at the Critérium International, winning the overall classification and stage 2, a short, undulating stage of 98.5 kilometers finishing in Monthermé. Voigt attacked near the Côte du Mont Malgré Tout, with almost 25 kilometers to go, and crossed the finish line solo, 48 seconds in front of the chasers. The last stage of the race was a short individual time trial of 8.3 kilometers which was raced in the afternoon of the same day, and Voigt stated he gave everything he had but was very careful while negotiating the turns. He finished seventh, keeping his leader's jersey and winning the 3-stage race, while the Swede Thomas Lövkvist of took second place. Another major win of the 2007 season came for him in the Deutschland Tour, which he won for the second year in a row, with Levi Leipheimer taking second place at 1'57\" and David Lopez of completing the overall classification podium. Voigt stated that his victory was harder to accomplish than the preceding year, when it was somewhat of a surprise. He was a marked man.\nVoigt began his 2008 season by taking part in the Paris-Nice and the Tour of California, where he did not obtain high personal results. In March, Voigt grabbed his fourth success on the short stage race Critérium International, registering a victory on stage 2 in the process. Another success awaited him at the stage 18 of the Giro d'Italia. He was part of a group that broke away from the field a mere into the stage. With to cover and a six minutes lead, Voigt left the breakaway and soloed to victory in Varese. In June, he came in fifth position of his National Road Race Championship and sixth in his National Time Trial. He was a big part of his team successes in the Tour de France, protecting the leader Carlos Sastre, who won the eighteenth stage atop the Alpe d'Huez climb. Before that decisive stage, the team was counting on a \"triple threat\" as far as leaders for the general classification went, with the Schleck brothers, who took fourth and sixth on that mountain stage. Sastre would go on to win the Tour, and the CSC team won the overall team classification. Voigt was selected to represent Germany in the Beijing Olympic Games along with Fabian Wegmann, Gerald Ciolek, Bert Grabsch and Stefan Schumacher. He took part in the road race, which he did not finish. He then dominated the Tour of Poland, earning an individual stage and helping his squad win the Team Time Trial in the process. Citing a long and draining season, Voigt declined to participate in the World Championships, a decision that his team approved.\n\nVoigt began the 2009 season well by winning the Critérium International for the fifth time in his career, tying Frenchman Raymond Poulidor's record while grabbing a stage win, the points classification and the mountains classification. He abandoned the 2009 Tour on 21 July 2009 as a consequence of a violent crash suffered while descending the Col du Petit-Saint-Bernard with the yellow jersey group during stage 16. He incurred a fracture of the right cheekbone and concussion. He had to skip several races to recuperate from his injuries, including the Cycling World Championship held in Mendrisio, Switzerland. He was inactive for a 6-week period and came back to competition at the Tour of Missouri, where he got a warm welcome from cycling fans.\n\nVoigt began his last season with team manager Bjarne Riis (2010) by participating in the Tour Down Under and the Vuelta a Mallorca. He got his first \"top ten\" result of the year in the , just short of the podium in fourth position. In March, Voigt participated in Paris-Nice, where he finished second of the prologue and grabbed the yellow jersey after the third stage, which was shortened due to snowfall. He lost the jersey the very next day to eventual winner Alberto Contador, but managed to finish fifth overall after Alejandro Valverde's second place was annulled for his implication in the Operación Puerto doping case. Voigt then headed to the Volta a Catalunya, where he won stage 4 after escaping from the peloton to join a group of four riders on the last ascent of the day. He eventually was left with only Rein Taaramae to worry about, and won the sprint against the rider. In May, he scored a sixth place overall in the Tour of California thanks to consistent placings in the hilly stages and finishing fifth in the individual time trial held in Los Angeles. He participated to the Tour de France as a domestique to his leaders, the Schleck brothers. Voigt survived a scare on the mountainous stage 16, where he crashed heavily on the descent of the Col de Peyresourde, destroying his bike. After getting back up, he realized that all the team cars had passed and that he would not be handed a new bike. Desperate, he borrowed a child's bike much too small for him, from a children group's car which was following the race. He rode on it for about before reaching a policeman who had another bicycle which had been left for him by his team. His teammate Andy Schleck finished the Tour in second place, but was later given the title since the original winner Alberto Contador tested positive to clenbuterol.\n\nThe 2011 season was to be the first one of his career in which he would not achieve a victory. He joined the newly formed , following the Schleck brothers, Fabian Cancellara and four other riders coming from his 2010 team, . Kim Andersen was the creator of that new team, being himself a former Saxo Bank manager. In the spring, he took part in Paris-Nice, taking the sixth place of the first stage, and then went on to help his teammate Fränk Schleck win the Critérium International. In May, he suffered a fracture to his scaphoid in a crash during the Tour of California, riding a whole stage with the injury before doctors discovered it with X-Rays. He healed in time for the Tour de France, ready to sacrifice himself and put any personal ambitions aside to help his leaders, the Schleck brothers. He played a pivotal role in helping the pair reach the second and third steps of the podium behind 's Cadel Evans. In August, Voigt went to the USA Pro Challenge, and had some good results by taking the fifth place of the prologue and then finishing eighth in the individual time trial. Designated to lead his squad in the Tour of Britain, Voigt suffered his second broken bone of the year in that race, this time a finger bone. The injury occurred in a crash on the first stage and he had to abandon. The healing process was a slow one since it took almost a month for a complete recovery to be achieved.\nIn 2012, Voigt was the oldest rider of the World Tour teams at 40 years of age when the season started. That did not stop him from going into a long breakaway on the sixth stage of Paris-Nice. After every rider had been dropped but one, Voigt was beaten in a sprint by Luis Leon Sanchez of the team. In April, Voigt participated to the Tour of the Basque Country, where a peculiar incident occurred. Voigt signed in late for a stage start, then had a bit of a verbal match against an official who complained about his lateness. He was fined sign: Fr. or SFr. or FS 1,000 Swiss francs for what was described as \"comportamiento incorrecto\" (bad behavior) in a report. He later had a good showing at the Tour of California, where he came in second of the fifth stage, an individual time trial contested in Bakersfield, 23 seconds behind David Zabriskie. He was also part of breakaways and paced the bunch often. On the Tour de France, he finished in third position of the tenth stage. He was dropped on the slopes of the Col du Grand Colombier, but came back on the four escapees before competing in the final sprint. In August, during a press conference prior to the Tour of Utah, he announced that he would continue racing through the 2013 season. In the same month, Voigt took the fourth stage of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge finishing in Beaver Creek. He attacked his breakaway companions on Independence Pass, which was situated in the first third of the race, and then soloed on to victory with almost three minutes of an advantage over the chasers. He raced more than alone, taking one of the most epic victory of his career.\nIn May 2013, at the Tour of California, Voigt contributed to creating an echelon on stage 5, splitting the peloton in half with to race. The 18 riders group stayed away until Voigt attacked with to race, winning solo in Avila Beach. Even at 41 years of age, he attacked on the penultimate stage of Tour de France, and won the combative award of the day before he was caught by the overall contenders, just a few kilometers into the final ascent.\n\nVoigt was selected by Trek Factory Racing as part of their team for the 2014 Tour de France, giving him a 17th start on \"the Grande Boucle\", matching the record for Tour starts held by George Hincapie and Stuart O'Grady. He was part of the break on Stage 1 of the tour, winning the combativity prize for the stage and taking the lead in the king of the mountains competition. As a mark of respect, the peloton let Voigt ride at the front on the first lap of the circuit in the Champs-Élysées in Paris where the race concludes, then battled for the sprint, won by Marcel Kittel.\n\nVoigt announced ahead of the 2014 USA Pro Cycling Challenge that the race would be his last as a professional. He almost won Stage 4 in that last race thanks to a day-long breakaway. He was joined by the raging peloton with only 900 meters to go. Before the last stage of the race, Voigt was asked in an interview with Outside Magazine: \"Americans also like your panache, the fact that you’re willing to go out on a break all day and attack. Where did you get that trait?\" to which he answered:\n\nIn December 2014 Trek Factory Racing announced that Voigt would stay with the team as a coach, with a view to becoming a directeur sportif.\n\nIn February 2015, it was announced that Voigt would be the official ambassador of the Tour of California. He also served as a television analyst and an adviser to the organizers.\n\nIn June 2015, it was announced that Voigt would host an annual Gran Fondo in Marin County, labeled The Jensie Gran Fondo of Marin.\n\nIn January 2017, Voigt completed an Everesting on Berlin's Teufelsberg, raising over €29,000 for Australia's Tour de Cure. Teufelsberg's climb is , so nearly 100 laps were required to reach the equivalent of Mt. Everest's . Voight's Fitbit data showed he rode in 26.5 hours, climbing . The weather conditions included snow and low temperatures of .. Voigt has ridden in the Tour de Cure Signature Tour annually since 2015.\n\nOn 3 September 2014, Voigt announced that he would try to beat the UCI hour record of 49.7 kilometers held by Ondřej Sosenka. The record attempt took place on 18 September 2014 in the Vélodrome Suisse in Grenchen. Jens Voigt's plans to attempt the record were hatched in June 2014 and followed some of the planning that was made for Fabian Cancellara's possible crack at the record. At 43 years old, Voigt had to work on his position on his bike to improve his aerodynamics. The bike on which the German rode was revealed on 12 September 2014. The attempt occurred on the day after Voigt's 43rd birthday and was broadcast live by Eurosport and the UCI channel on YouTube. Prior to the attempt, some prominent cycling personalities such as Bradley Wiggins, Eddy Merckx and Chris Boardman expressed the opinion that Voigt had a fair chance of beating the 49.7 km mark.\n\nThe record attempt was successful. In front of an audience of 1600 people, Voigt rode 51.110 kilometers during the course of an hour, beating the previous record by 1.410 kilometers. He reached the previous mark on the 199th lap of the velodrome, with 1:28 remaining. Voigt used a modified version of the Trek Speed Concept frame, with dual disc wheels and standard aero bars. He also used a front gearing of 54 teeth and a rear gearing of 14 teeth. Voigt stood up on his machine a couple of times during the event. He was faster at the end of the attempt, as he covered some laps (250 meters) in under 17 seconds. Voigt is the oldest rider to ever beat the record and his average power output was 412 watts. He is also the first German to hold the record. The UCI president, Brian Cookson, believed that this event could be the start of a cascade of attempts by other riders who perform well in time trials.\nSetting the hour record capped a 17-year career in which he is estimated to have bicycled 850,000 km (ca. 528,000 miles). Voigt's record stood until 30 October 2014, when it was broken by Austrian cyclist Matthias Brändle.\n\nVoigt never tested positive to performance-enhancing drugs in his career. He alleged that he never doped and was always against the practice. At the end of October 2012, he wrote a blog entry to address the turmoil caused by the Lance Armstrong-USADA doping affair, and related in it his personal experiences, stating that he \"just never doped\". Voigt argued that it was impossible for him to imagine that he would be regarded as a doper and cheater by his children if he took performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nTyler Hamilton felt Voigt was jeopardizing his fight against doping in autumn 2012. While Hamilton has no proof, he is convinced that Voigt doped. Voigt reacted by saying that he never heard about doping while he was on the CSC team.

{"id": "2206601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206601", "title": "Uttarapatha", "text": "Uttarapatha\n\nAncient Buddhist and Hindu texts use Uttarapatha as the name of the Northern part of Jambudvipa, one of the \"continents\" in Hindu history. In modern times, the Sanskrit word \"uttarapatha\" is sometimes used to denote the geographical regions of North India, Western India, Central India, Eastern India, Northeast India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal in just one term. The pronunciation of the word varies depending on the regional language of the speaker.\n\nThe name is derived from the Sanskrit terms \"uttara\", for north, and \"patha\", for road. Initially, the term Uttarapatha referred to the \"northern high road\", the main trade route that followed along the river Ganges, crossed the Indo-Gangetic watershed, ran through the Punjab to Taxila (Gandhara) and further to \"Zariaspa\" or Balkh (Bactria) in Central Asia. The eastern terminus of the Uttarapatha was Tamraliptika or Tamluk located at the mouth of Ganges in west Bengal. This route became increasingly important due to increasing maritime contacts with the seaports on the eastern coast of India during the Maurya rule. Later, Uttarapatha was the name lent to the vast expanse of region which the \"northern high road\" traversed.\n\nThe boundaries of Uttarapatha, as a region, are nowhere precisely defined in the Buddhist or any other ancient source. According to some writers, the Uttarapatha included the whole of Northern India, from Anga in the east to Gandhara in the north-west, and from the Himalaya in the north to the Vindhya in the south.\n\nThe Jambudvipa region to the south of Uttarapatha was known as \"Majjhimadesa\" (or the Middle Country) in Buddhist texts and \"Madhyadesa\" in Puranic texts.\n\nAccording to Buddhist texts, Kamboja and Gandhara, two of the sixteen Mahajanapadas or great nations referred to in the Anguttara Nikaya and Chulla-Niddesa belonged to the \"Uttarapatha\".\n\nThe Buddhist texts include the remaining fourteen of the Mahajanapadas, namely Kasi, Kosala, Anga, Magadha, Vajji, Malla, Chedi, Vamsa (or Vatsa), Kuru, Panchala, Machcha (or Mattsya), Surasena, Avanti and Assaka in the \"Majjhimadesa\" division.\n\nNumerous Puranic literature terms refer to the Bahlikas, Pahlavas, Sakas, Paradas, Ramathas, Kambojas, Daradas, Tushars, Chinas, Barbaras, Keikayas, Abhiras, Sindhus, Soviras and others as the tribes of Uttarapatha (\"Kirfel list of the Uttarapatha countries of the Bhuvanakosa\").\n\nUttarapatha was famous from very early times for its fine breed of horses and the horse-dealers. There are ancient references to an ongoing trade between the nations of Uttarapatha and the states of East India. Buddhist and Puranic sources attest that the merchants and horse-dealers from Uttarapatha would bring horses and other goods for sale down to eastern Indian places like Savatthi (Kosala), Benares (Kasi), Pataliputra (Magadha), Pragjyotisha (Assam) and Tamarlipitka (in Bengal).\n\nGreat Indian epic, Mahabharata gives account of the ancient roadways. It refers to Uttarapatha (northern highway) which linked the territories of Kirata (perhaps of Magadha), Kamboja, Gandhara and Yavana countries (Shanti Parva, 207.43; Foreign Trade and Commerce in Ancient India, 2003, p 107, Prakash Chandra Prasad)\n\nDocumentation exists that the nations from the Uttarapatha like Kamboja, Gandhara and Kashmira were actively engaged in commercial intercourse not only with the states of Gangetic valley but also with Myanmar, \"Suvarnabhumi\", south-west China and other nations in the Southeast Asia. When the Chinese envoy Chiang Kien was in Gandhara (circa c 127 BCE), he found to his great surprise that bamboos and textiles from \"south-western China\" were sold in the local markets. \"On personal enquiry, he learnt that these goods were brought to eastern India (Bengal) through Yunnan, Burma and then carried all the way from eastern India to Bactria across India and Afghanistan along the Uttarapatha or the northern high road\".\n\nThe ancient Pali literature says that merchants from the nations of Uttarapatha were engaged in international trade following the well-known Kamboja-Dvaravati Caravan Route. Merchants from Kamboja, Gandhara, Sovira, Sindhu and other places used to sail from ports of Bharukaccha (modern Bharoch) and Supparaka Pattana (modern Nalla-Sopara, near Mumbai) for trade with Southern India, Sri Lanka and nations of Southeast Asia. Huge trade ships sailed from there directly to south Myanmar. This trade had been going on for hundreds of years before the Buddha. Some merchants from northern India had settled in Myanmar, in the ports and towns located at the mouths of Irrawaddy, Citranga (Sittang) and Salavana (Salween) rivers. The case in point is of two merchant brothers \"Tapassu\" and \"Bhalluka or Bhalluka\" from \"Pokkharavati\" (=Pushkalavati, present Carasadda) in Gandhara-Kamboja region who also had their trade settlement in Myanmar. The name Irrawaddy for the chief river of Burma (Myanmar) was copied from river Irrawati (Ravi) of north Panjab. There is also a tradition in Ceylon (\"recorded in the Pūjāvaliya\") that Tapassu and Bhalluka visited the east coast of Ceylon and built a Cetiya, there. An inscription also makes a similar record.\n\nEvidence exists that horse-dealers from Kamboja in the Uttarapatha were trading horses as far as Sri Lanka. Dr Don Martino notes that the merchants from north-west Kamboja had been conducting horse-trade with Sri Lanka following the west coast of India since remote antiquity (\"Epigraphia Zeylanka, Vol II, No 13, p 76\").\n\nSeveral ancient cave inscriptions found in Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka attest the existence of a Kamboja Goshatha or Samgha (\"Gote Kabojhiana\") and a Grand Kamboja Trade Guild (\"Kabojiya Mahapughyanam\") in ancient Sinhala. The terms Kaboja and Kabojiya are the ancient Sinhalese forms of the Uttarapatha Kamboja.\n\nA Pali text \"Sihalavatthu\" of fourth century specifically attests a group of people known as \"Kambojas\" living in Rohana in Sri Lanka.\n\nA regular horse-trade between the nations of Uttarapatha and those of eastern, western and southern India is attested to have been going on as late as the medieval ages. King Devapala (810-850 CE)) of Bengal, King Vishnuvardhana Hoysala (1106–1152 CE) of Mysore and King Valabhi Deva of Valbhi/Saurashtra (1185 CE) had powerful fleets of Kamboja horses in their cavalries.\n\nThere is also good archeological evidence of Roman trade (1 CE to 200 CE) coming into Gandhara/Kamboja and Bactria region in Uttarapatha through the Gujarati peninsula. The Roman gold coins imported from Rome into Gandhara were usually melted into bullion in these regions.\n\nCorresponding to Uttarapatha, the Dakshinapatha was the name of \"southern high road\" which originated from Varanasi, followed through Ujjaini and Narmada valley to Pratisthana (Paithan) in the Mahajanapada of Ashmaka (in modern Maharashtra), onwards to the western coast of India and running in the southern direction. According to \"Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India's Geography\" by Sanjeev Sanyal, the crossing of the two highways made Sarnath (just outside Varanasi) a major place of exchange of goods and ideas in ancient India. Sanyal argues that this is why the Buddha gave his first sermon at Sarnath.\n\nLater, Dakshinapatha was also the name lent to the region of India lying to the south of Vindya through which the Dakshinapatha passed. The name Deccan for the southern part of India has originated from this ancient Dakshinapatha. The philosophies of the easterners were disseminated precisely by the intercourse that went on along the \"Uttarapatha\" and the \"Dakishinapatha\" trade routes.\n\n"}

It was originally isolated from semen.\n\nSpermidine is an aliphatic polyamine. Spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes its formation from putrescine. It is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and its structural isomer thermospermine.\n\nSpermidine synchronizes an array of biological processes (such as Ca, Na, K -ATPase) thus maintaining membrane potential and controlling intracellular pH and volume. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na,K-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes.\n\nSpermidine is a longevity agent in mammals due to various mechanisms of action, which are just beginning to be understood. Autophagy is the main mechanism at the molecular level, but evidence has been found for other mechanisms, including inflammation reduction, lipid metabolism, and regulation of cell growth, proliferation and death.\n\nSpermidine is known to regulate plant growth, assisting the \"in vitro\" process of transcribing RNA, and inhibition of NOS. Also, spermidine is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and thermospermine, some of which contribute to tolerance against drought and salinity in plants.\n\nSpermidine has been tested and discovered to encourage hair shaft elongation and lengthen hair growth. Spermidine has also been found to “upregulate expression of the epithelial stem cell-associated keratins K15 and K19, and dose-dependently modulated K15 promoter activity \"in situ\" and the colony forming efficiency, proliferation and K15 expression of isolated human K15-GFP+ cells \"in vitro\".”\nSpermidine's known actions include:\n\nGood dietary sources of spermidine are aged cheese, mushrooms, soy products, legumes, corn, and whole grains. Spermidine is plentiful in a Mediterranean diet.\nFor comparison: The spermidine content in human seminal plasma varies between approx. 15 and 50 mg/L (mean 31 mg/L).\n\nIn grains, the endosperm contains most of the spermidine. One of the best known grain dietary sources is wheat germ, containing as much as 243 mg/kg.\n\n\n\n"}

Distinct and separate from the G20 major economies, the group emerged at the 5th Ministerial WTO conference, held in Cancún, Mexico, from 10 September to 14 September 2003. The group accounted for 60% of the world's population, 70% of its farmers and 26% of world’s agricultural exports.\n\nIts origins date back to June 2003, when foreign ministers from Brazil, India and South Africa signed a declaration known as the Brasilia Declaration, on June 6, 2003. in which they stated that \"major trading partners are still moved by protectionist concerns in their countries’ less competitive sectors [...] and emphasized how important it is that the results of the current round of trade negotiations provide especially for the reversal of protectionist policies and trade-distorting practices [...] Furthermore, Brazil, India and South Africa decided to articulate their initiatives of trade liberalization\".\n\nNonetheless, the \"official\" appearance of the group occurred as a response to a text released on 13 August 2003 by the European Communities (EC) and the United States with a common proposal on agriculture for the Cancún Ministerial. On 20 August 2003 a document signed by twenty countries and re-issued as a Cancún Ministerial document on 4 September proposed an alternative framework to that of the EC and the US on agriculture for the Cancún Meeting. This document marked the establishment of the group. The original group of signatories of the 20 August 2003 document went through many changes, being known as such different names as the G-21 or the G-22. The title G-20 was finally chosen, in honor of the date of the group's establishment.\n\nSince its creation, the group had a fluctuating membership. Previous members include: Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Turkey. In December 2017, the group had 23 members.\n\n"}
{"id": "2206608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206608", "title": "G20", "text": "G20\n\nThe G20 (or Group of Twenty) is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union (EU). Founded in 1999 with the aim to discuss policy pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability, the G20 has expanded its agenda since 2008 and heads of government or heads of state, as well as finance ministers and foreign ministers, have periodically conferred at summits ever since. It seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organization.\n\nMembership of the G20 consists of 19 individual countries plus the European Union. The EU is represented by the European Commission and by the European Central Bank. Collectively, the G20 economies account for around 90% of the gross world product (GWP), 80% of world trade (or, if excluding EU intra-trade, 75%), two-thirds of the world population, and approximately half of the world land area.\n\nWith the G20 growing in stature after its inaugural leaders' summit in 2008, its leaders announced on 25 September 2009 that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations. Since its inception, the G20's membership policies have been criticized by some intellectuals, and its summits have been a focus for major protests by left-wing groups and anarchists.\n\nThe heads of the G20 nations held summits twice in 2009 and twice in 2010. Since the November 2011 Cannes summit, G20 summits have been held annually.\n\nThe G20 is the latest in a series of post–World War II initiatives aimed at international coordination of economic policy, which include institutions such as the \"Bretton Woods twins\", the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and what is now the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe G20 was foreshadowed at the Cologne summit of the G7 in June 1999, and formally established at the G7 Finance Ministers' meeting on 26 September 1999 with an inaugural meeting on 15–16 December 1999 in Berlin. Canadian finance minister Paul Martin was chosen as the first chairman and German finance minister Hans Eichel hosted the inaugural meeting.\n\nA 2004 report by Colin I. Bradford and Johannes F. Linn of the Brookings Institution asserted the group was founded primarily at the initiative of Eichel, the concurrent chair of the G7. However, Bradford later described then-Finance Minister of Canada (and future Prime Minister of Canada) Paul Martin as \"the crucial architect of the formation of the G-20 at finance minister level\", and as the one who later \"proposed that the G-20 countries move to leaders level summits\". Canadian academic and journalistic sources have also identified the G20 a project initiated by Martin and then-US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. All acknowledge, however, that Germany and the United States played a key role in bringing their vision into reality.\n\nMartin and Summers conceived of the G20 in response to the series of massive debt crises that had spread across emerging markets in the late 1990s, beginning with the Mexican peso crisis and followed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and eventually impacting the United States, most prominently in the form of the collapse of the prominent hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in the autumn of 1998. It illustrated to them that in a rapidly globalizing world, the G7, G8, and the Bretton Woods system would be unable to provide financial stability, and they conceived of a new, broader permanent group of major world economies that would give a voice and new responsibilities in providing it.\n\nThe G20 membership was decided by Eichel's deputy Caio Koch-Weser and Summers's deputy Timothy Geithner. According to the political economist Robert Wade:\n\nThe G20's primary focus has been governance of the global economy. Summit themes have varied from year to year. \nThe theme of the 2006 G20 ministerial meeting was \"Building and Sustaining Prosperity\". The issues discussed included domestic reforms to achieve \"sustained growth\", global energy and resource commodity markets, reform of the World Bank and IMF, and the impact of demographic changes due to an aging world population.\n\nIn 2007, South Africa hosted the secretariat with Trevor A. Manuel, South African Minister of Finance as chairperson of the G20.\nIn 2008, Guido Mantega, Brazil's Minister of Finance, was the G20 chairperson and proposed dialogue on competition in financial markets, clean energy, economic development and fiscal elements of growth and development.\n\nOn 11 October 2008 after a meeting of G7 finance ministers, US President George W. Bush stated that the next meeting of the G20 would be important in finding solutions to the burgeoning economic crisis of 2008.\n\nThe Summit of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, who prepare the leaders' summit and implement their decisions, was created as a response both to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and to a growing recognition that key emerging countries were not adequately included in the core of global economic discussion and governance. Additionally, the G20 summits of heads of state or government were held.\n\nAfter the 2008 debut summit in Washington, DC, G20 leaders met twice a year: in London and Pittsburgh in 2009, and in Toronto and Seoul in 2010.\n\nSince 2011, when France chaired and hosted the G20, the summits have been held only once a year. \nThe 2016 summit was held in Hangzhou, China, the 2017 summit was held in Hamburg, Germany and the 2018 summit was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nA number of other ministerial-level G20 meetings have been held since 2010. Agriculture ministerial meetings were conducted in 2011 and 2012; meetings of foreign ministers were held in 2012 and 2013; trade ministers met in 2012 and 2014, and employment ministerial meetings have taken place annually since 2010.\n\nIn 2012, the G20 Ministers of Tourism and Heads of Delegation of G20 member countries and other invited States, as well as representatives from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and other organisations in the Travel & Tourism sector met in Merida, Mexico, on May 16 at the 4th T20 meeting and focused on 'Tourism as a means to Job Creation'. As a result of this meeting and The World Travel & Tourism Council’s Visa Impact Research, later on the Leaders of the G20, convened in Los Cabos on 18–19 June, would recognise the impact of Travel & Tourism for the first time. That year, the G20 Leaders Declaration added the following statement: \"We recognise the role of travel and tourism as a vehicle for job creation, economic growth and development, and, while recognizing the sovereign right of States to control the entry of foreign nationals, we will work towards developing travel facilitation initiatives in support of job creation, quality work, poverty reduction and global growth.\"\n\nIn March 2014, the former Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop, when Australia was hosting the 2014 G20 summit in Brisbane, proposed to ban Russia from the summit over its role in the 2014 Crimean crisis. \nThe BRICS foreign ministers subsequently reminded Bishop that \"the custodianship of the G20 belongs to all Member States equally and no one Member State can unilaterally determine its nature and character.\"\n\nJapan hosted the 2019 summit. 2020 summit will be in Saudi Arabia. The Leaders’ Summit will be held on 21–22 November 2020 in Riyadh. In the run-up to the Summit, the Presidency will host more than 100 meetings and conferences, including ministerial meetings, as well as meetings of officials and representatives from civil society.\n\nTo decide which member nation gets to chair the G20 leaders' meeting for a given year, all members, except the European Union, are assigned to one of five different groupings, with all but one group having four members, the other having three. Nations from the same region are placed in the same group, except Group 1 and Group 2. All countries within a group are eligible to take over the G20 Presidency when it is their group's turn. Therefore, the states within the relevant group need to negotiate among themselves to select the next G20 President. Each year, a different G20 member country assumes the presidency starting from 1 December until 30 November. This system has been in place since 2010, when South Korea, which is in Group 5, held the G20 chair. The table below lists the nations' groupings:\nTo ensure continuity, the presidency is supported by a \"troika\" made up of the current, immediate past and next host countries.\n\nThe G20 operates without a permanent secretariat or staff. The group's chair rotates annually among the members and is selected from a different regional grouping of countries. The incumbent chair establishes a temporary secretariat for the duration of its term, which coordinates the group's work and organizes its meetings. The 2018 chair was Argentina, which hosted the 2018 summit in Buenos Aires. The 2019 chair was Japan, which hosted the 2019 G20 Osaka summit. The current chair of is Saudi Arabia-2020, which will host the 2020 G20 Riyadh summit. The 2021 summit will be held in Italy.\n\nIn 2010, President of France Nicolas Sarkozy proposed the establishment of a permanent G20 secretariat, similar to the United Nations. Seoul and Paris were suggested as possible locations for its headquarters. Brazil and China supported the establishment of a secretariat, while Italy and Japan expressed opposition to the proposal. South Korea proposed a \"cyber secretariat\" as an alternative. It has been argued that the G20 has been using the OECD as a secretariat.\n\n there are 20 members of the group: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Spain is a permanent guest invitee.\n\nRepresentatives include, at the leaders' summits, the leaders of 19 countries and of the European Union, and, at the ministerial-level meetings, the finance ministers and central bank governors of 19 countries and of the European Union.\n\nIn addition, each year, the G20's guests include Spain; the Chair of ASEAN; two African countries (the chair of the African Union and a representative of the New Partnership for Africa's Development) and a country (sometimes more than one) invited by the presidency, usually from its own region. \nThe first of the tables below lists the member entities and their heads of government, finance ministers and central bank governors.

It is the foundation for the double-entry bookkeeping system. For each transaction, the total debits equal the total credits. It can be expressed as furthermore:\nthumb\n\nIn a corporation, capital represents the stockholders' equity. Since every business transaction affects at least two of a company's accounts, the accounting equation will always be “in balance,” meaning the left side should always equal the right side. Thus, the accounting formula essentially shows that what the firm owns (its assets) is purchased by either what it owes (its liabilities) or by what its owners invest (its shareholders' equity or capital).\n\nThe formula can be rewritten:\n\nNow it shows owners' equity is equal to property (assets) minus debts (liabilities). Since in a corporation owners are shareholders, owner's equity is called shareholders' equity.\nEvery accounting transaction affects at least one element of the equation, but always balances. Simple transactions also include:\n\nThese are some simple examples, but even the most complicated transactions can be recorded in a similar way. This equation is behind debits, credits, and journal entries.\n\nThis equation is part of the transaction analysis model, for which we also write\n\nand\n\nThe equation resulting from making these substitutions in the accounting equation may be referred to as the \"expanded\" accounting equation, because it yields the breakdown of the equity component of the equation.\n\nThe accounting equation is fundamental to the double-entry bookkeeping practice. Its applications in accountancy and economics are thus diverse.\n\nA company's quarterly and annual reports are basically derived directly from the accounting equations used in bookkeeping practices. These equations, entered in a business's general ledger, will provide the material that eventually makes up the foundation of a business's financial statements. This includes expense reports, cash flow, interest and loan payments, salaries, and company investments.\n\nThe accounting equation plays a significant role as the foundation of the double-entry bookkeeping system. The primary aim of the double-entry system is to keep track of debits and credits and ensure that the sum of these always matches up to the company assets, a calculation carried out by the accounting equation. It is based on the idea that each transaction has an equal effect. It is used to transfer totals from books of prime entry into the nominal ledger. Every transaction is recorded twice so that the debit is balanced by a credit.\n\nThe income and retained earnings of the accounting equation is also an essential component in computing, understanding, and analyzing a firm's income statement. This statement reflects profits and losses that are themselves determined by the calculations that make up the basic accounting equation. In other words, this equation allows businesses to determine revenue as well as prepare a statement of retained earnings. This then allows them to predict future profit trends and adjust business practices accordingly. Thus, the accounting equation is an essential step in determining company profitability.\n\nSince the balance sheet is founded on the principles of the accounting equation, this equation can also be said to be responsible for estimating the net worth of an entire company. The fundamental components of the accounting equation include the calculation of both company holdings and company debts; thus, it allows owners to gauge the total value of a firm's assets.\n\nHowever, due to the fact that accounting is kept on a historical basis, the equity is typically not the net worth of the organization. Often, a company may depreciate capital assets in 5–7 years, meaning that the assets will show on the books as less than their \"real\" value, or what they would be worth on the secondary market.\n\nDue to its role in determining a firm's net worth, the accounting equation is an important tool for investors looking to measure a company's holdings and debts at any particular time, and frequent calculations can indicate how steady or erratic a business's financial dealings might be. This provides valuable information to creditors or banks that might be considering a loan application or investment in the company.\n"}

She was the third consort of then-Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn (now Rama X) from February 2001 to December 2014.\n\nSrirasmi Suwadee was born in Samut Songkhram Province to a family of modest means. She was the third of four children born to Apiruj and Wanthanee Suwadee, and has Mon descent from her mother's side.\n\nShe attended Bangkok Business College and in 1993, at age 22, entered the service of Vajiralongkorn as a \"lady-in-waiting.\" Srirasmi enrolled in Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University in 1997 and graduated in 2002 with a bachelor’s degree in management science. Vajiralongkorn personally bestowed her with her diploma. In 2007 she received a Master of Science degree in Family and Child Development from Kasetsart University.\n\nSrirasmi married the Crown Prince of Thailand on 10 February 2001 in a private ceremony at the prince's Nonthaburi Palace. The public was informed of the event some time afterwards. The prince, who had married twice before and has children with his previous wives, stated it was his intention to settle down: \"I am now 50 years old and think I should have a complete family.\" After the wedding, Srirasmi was styled Mom Srirasmi Mahidol na Ayudhya (Mahidol is the surname of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and King Ananda Mahidol, and the na Ayudhya designation signifies non-titled descendants of the Chakri Dynasty and their spouses).\n\nOn 14 February 2005, it was announced that Srirasmi was pregnant. On 29 April 2005, a son named Dipangkorn Rasmijoti was born via caesarean section at Siriraj Hospital. Because of the birth, she was granted by King Bhumibol Adulyadej the title \"Princess of Thailand\" and styled \"Her Royal Highness\" as the royal consort of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. A royal ceremony, called \"Phra Ratchaphithi Somphot Duean Lae Khuen Phra U,\" to celebrate the first month of the baby was held on 17 June 2005 at the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall in Bangkok.\n\nSrirasmi initiated and launched the \"Sai Yai Rak Chak Mae Su Luk\" (Love and care from mother to children) campaign which promoted breast feeding. The campaign features images of her son.\n\nIn November 2009, a home video was released showing Vajiralongkorn and a topless Srirasmi celebrating the birthday of the prince's poodle dog. The media reported that this was indicative of the couple's decadent lifestyle.\n\nA letter asking for Srirasmi's family to be stripped of their royal name was sent to the interior ministry in November 2014. The letter was sent by her husband, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, after allegations of corruption against seven of her relatives. On 11 December 2014, the \"Royal Thai Government Gazette\" announced that Srirasmi relinquished her royal title, presumably due to the corruption affairs that involved her family. Srirasmi was granted a payment of 200 million baht (US$6 million) by Maha Vajiralongkorn in exchange for her relinquishment. The money was paid out of the Crown Property Bureau, as confirmed by the Ministry of Finance.\n\nSince Srirasmi's divorce, her parents, father Apiruj Suwadee and mother Wanthanee, were arrested for Lèse-majesté. The two later admitted to misusing their royal connection 12 years prior, which led to a former neighbor being jailed on bogus fraud charges. Both were sentenced to five years in prison, which was reduced to two and a half years.\n\n\n\n"}

She was also a direct granddaughter of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), and aunt of King Vajiralongkorn (Rama X).\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana was born on 6 May 1923 in London, England, the only daughter of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej of Songkla, the sixty-ninth son of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) and seventh son by Queen Savang Vadhana, and Miss Sangwan Talapat (later known as Princess Srinagarindra, The Princess Mother). She was initially named May Songkla on her birth certificate and was later named Her Serene Highness Galyani Vadhana Mahidol by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI). The word \"Vadhana\" in her name came from her paternal grandmother, Savang Vadhana. In 1927, she was subsequently promoted to the royal rank, a Princess of Thailand (\"Her Highness\") by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII).\n\nIn 1935, Princess Galyani Vadhana attended a secondary school for girls named Ecole Superieure des Jeunes Filles de la Ville de Lausanne.\n\nIn 1938, she attended the International School of Geneva, a boarding school not far from Lausanne. She was an excellent student, and eventually came first of her school at the final exam and third in all Switzerland.\n\nIn 1942, Princess Galyani Vadhana continued her studies at the Faculty of Sciences in the field of chemistry at the University of Lausanne. She graduated with a bachelor of science degree in chemistry in 1948. While pursuing her science degree, she also studied social science and education for a Diplome de Sciences Sociales Pedagogiques, involving teacher education, literature, philosophy, and psychology.\n\nIn 1944, Princess Galyani Vadhana renounced her royal status in order to marry Colonel Aram Rattanakul Serireongrit (24 August 1920 – 3 February 1982), the son of General Luang Serireongrit (Charoon Ratanakul Serireongrit), a former Army commander-in-chief who led the invasion of the Shan States during World War II. They are the parents of one daughter, Thanpuying Dhasanawalaya Ratanakul Serireongrit (later Sornsongkram) (born in 1945 in Switzerland). This marriage ended in divorce. In 1950, when the current king ascended the throne, he reinstated her royal status.\n\nIn 1969 the princess married Prince Varananda Dhavaj (19 August 1922 – 15 September 1990), son of Prince Chudadhuj Dharadilok, Prince of Bejraburna and Mom Ravi Kayananda. They had no children.\n\nOn 6 May 1995 – the occasion of her 72nd birthday – her brother, King Bhumibol gave her the noble title \"Kromma Luang Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra\" (loosely translated 'Princess of Naradhiwas'), making her the only female member of the Chakri Royal Family in the reign of King Rama IX to have been bestowed this title. In announcing the honour, The king said \"the Princess, who was his only sister, had shared the joys and sorrows of life since their early years and was the most highly respected in that she had always given him support. Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that she has been steadfast in her devotion to the King in order that He would enjoy grace and glory.\" She had represented the king in carrying out various royal duties and had took good care of their mother, which was a great relief to him.\n\nThe princess' royal patronage projects included traditional Thai arts, education, sports, and social welfare. She was president or honorary president of various organisations and foundations, including the Cardiac Children's Foundation, the Princess Mother's Charity Fund, and the Autistic Foundation of Thailand. She created her own foundation for funding the studies of young, gifted musicians.\n\nShe was a patron of various classical music foundations. On her trips, she always gathered important and useful information shown in the royal news, giving knowledge to people. She also wrote books, poetry, and spoke French. She traveled widely within Thailand and abroad to represent the royal family and her country on missions.\n\nThe princess was admitted to Siriraj Hospital in June 2007, suffering from abdominal pains. The doctors found she had cancer, and she remained in the hospital for treatment. In October 2007, doctors reported the princess had suffered an infarction on the left side of her brain as a result of occlusion of a cerebral artery.\n\nAt the same time in October, her brother, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was treated at Siriraj after he experienced weakness on his right side; doctors later found out through scans that he had a blood shortage to his brain. He was admitted on 13 October and discharged on 7 November. After leaving Siriraj, he visited his sister at the hospital almost daily.\n\nOn 14 December, the Royal Household Bureau released its 25th statement about the princess's health, saying she was feeling increasingly tired and was becoming less responsive.\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana liked reading and writing from an early age. While studying Prathom 1 to Prathom 3, she read as many Thai language books as she could find. However, children's books in Thai were then rare so she often read the newspaper. She remembered once reading a story in the original French—the 1878 novel \"Sans Famille\"—while studying in Switzerland, which she later found again.\n\nDuring her secondary studies, especially while in Geneva, Switzerland, she read a lot of literature. She found that reading developed her French language skills. Later, when she was a French teacher at Thammasat University, she read many books on linguistics. In addition, she also studied art, culture, archaeology, and history for many years. When she planned visiting a foreign country, she would first read many books and documents about it.\n\nWhen she was nine, she published a journal, \"Ruaen Rom\", containing articles she had written with her friends at Srapathum Palace. Her mother supported her in reading and writing English. On 10 September 1932, she published a story she had written. In addition, she wrote eleven poems about the royal family, translated three books, wrote ten tourist guide books, and an academic article.\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana was interested in photography. She had learned to take photographs not only as souvenirs but also for art and academic purposes. When she visited important places either at home or abroad, she always took photographs of those she found interesting which were useful in her travel writings.\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana studied Western art. She was interested in all types of music and drama, especially classical music by master composers. She began listening classical music while studying in Switzerland. She had always studied piano at home with her younger brothers, but only intermittently as she had very little time to practice. While doing her homework, she liked to listen to classical music on a radio.\n\nIn 2004, concerned about the lack of interest in promoting classical music by both governmental and private sectors, she established a Fund for Classical Music Promotion of which she became president. The fund supported classical music and related activities, provided assistance to Thai musicians to study, and promoted competitions and concerts both in Thailand and internationally. She also supported the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra and the Chulalongkorn University Symphony Orchestra, and was the patron of the Bangkok Opera.\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana was interested in all education, not only at university level. She realized that primary education is very important for developing the general population.\n\nFrom her long experience in teaching French language, she realized the problem of interrupted French language study at mattayom (high school) and university level. In 1977 she formed \"L'Association Thailandaise des Professeurs de Francais\" (The Association of Thai Professors Teaching French Language) to act as the center for meeting and exchanging experiences of – and improving – the teaching of French language in mattayom and university classes. She was president of the association between 1977 and 1981, when she became its honorary president for the rest of her life. Her assistance to the association took many forms, including in publishing journals to distribute the latest knowledge, writing her own articles in journals, and supporting teachers' seminars, research abroad and study in higher education.\n\nAs a result of her continuous work in the teaching and research of the French language in Thailand, she was conferred many honorary doctorates and also honours from many foreign governments and international organizations, including UNESCO.\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana was interested in history and archaeology for many years. She thought these fields to be the foundations of other subjects and believed in applying reasoning to support historical ideas. She always said that her thoughts were not always correct and she would accept new data if supported by reason and evidences.\n\nIn performing her duties, she became interested in many important places, which she later visited by herself. She also led groups and associations on educational tours to many historic sites, and she advised fellow guides to emphasize education about the sites.\n\nWhen visiting historical sites, she did not merely accept information given to her by the archaeologists, but she would research the sites beforehand, and deeply question experts about the site's restoration and excavation, and the impact on neighbouring people of the archaeologists' operations.\n\nThis foundation was begun in 1981 by the Princess Mother. Princess Galyani Vadhana became its patron on 15 June 1984. She added some of her personal property to her mother's fund and provided personal advice, thus developing its activities. It helps many sick children, especially from poor families, to be cured and treated by professional cardiac doctors, using mechanical heart valve replacement, heart pacemaker, balloon catheter, and surgery without prosthesis. Furthermore, this foundation disseminates knowledge of cardiac diseases to doctors, nurses, and the public. It also provides funds for pediatricians to study cardiac diseases in children either in Thailand or abroad.\n\nThis is a foundation set up by Princess Boonjirathorn Juthathuj on 27 June 1979 to provide scholarships and awards to medical and nursing students, nursing lecturers, and nurses affiliated with Ministry of Public Health. Its President was Princess Galyani Vadhana who chaired the scholarship and award conferring committee. The first prize-giving by Princess Boonjirathorn was organized at Samitivej Hospital on 18 September 1979. Afterwards scholarships and awards were given by the Princess every year.\n\nThis foundation was created in December 1994 from Charity Funds of the Princess Mother. Princess Galyani Vadhana was President, while her mother was Patron and Honorary President. Its objective is to promote knowledge and understanding of breast cancer screening. The Breast Center was established in Siriraj Hospital to provide complete breast diseases examination and diagnosis. With the modern equipment in the center, the first in Thailand, breast radiography can be carried out to enable biopsies to be carried out accurately, correctly, with very little pain. It is also timesaving and less expensive.\n\nIn 1964, while the Mother Princess was staying at Phu Phing Palace, Chiang Mai, she realised how poor the local populace were especially in food and medicine. She set up \"The Mother Princess Medical Volunteer Unit\" on 22 February 1969, and persuaded doctors, dentists, pharmacists, and nurses to join the unit to go and treat patients in remote communities. On 21 May 1974, the unit was renamed to become \"The Mother Princess Medical Volunteer Foundation\" with the Mother Princess as its President.\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana followed her mother's example in the foundation's daily operations. Together they would lead volunteers to visit and treat people in rural areas. Some patients were sent for treatment at the provincial central hospital or to Bangkok. They often journeyed by helicopters because some areas had no roads. After the Princess Mother died, Princess Galyani Vadhana became President.\n\nIn 1991, Princess Galyani Vadhana visited and stayed at Huai Nam Dang Watershed Management Unit. She found that the nearby forests were deteriorated as a result of agricultural reclamation, so she had the idea of forming a Royal Forest Department to restore the forests. Then in 1995, the Royal Forest Department designated this area as Huai Nam Dang National Park, and built a chalet-style palace, which the princess named \"Silver Orchids Palace\", dedicated to her. She stayed there during late January and early February every year to visit nearby hill tribes. Her thinking was that the public and local administration organization co-operate to look after forest, water, wildlife, and rare flora to maintain natural balance.\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana traveled abroad many times on formal and private visits. In addition to strengthening friendly relations with those countries, her visits helped spread knowledge of Thai culture and customs. Before any such visit she would carry out careful research.\n\nAfter most of these visits, she collected her notes and the information she had gathered to publish books or reproduce them in digital media for distribution.\n\nIn 2003 she visited Gretzenbach in Switzerland to officially dedicate the Wat Srinagarindravararam, a temple named in honour of her mother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 2 January 2008, the Royal Household Bureau announced that during the night of Tuesday, 1 January 2008, the Princess's condition had worsened and she had died at 02:54 on Wednesday, 2 January 2008, at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, aged 84. There was to be a mourning period of 100 days, starting from the day of her death. The prime minister announced that all government officials and agencies would wear black for 15 days while the cabinet would wear black for the full 100 days.\n\nThe 300 million baht (US$10 million, £7.1 million) funeral, was the first full royal funeral since 1995, when the king's mother Srinagarindra was cremated. The six-day funeral ceremony and ritual started on 14 November 2008, at the Grand Palace, and ended on 19 November when Galyani's ashes were transferred to the Rangsi Vadhana Memorial, Wat Ratchabophit Sathit Maha Simaram.\n\nOn Saturday, 15 November, three processions from the royal throne hall, where she had lain in state for ten months, were composed of 3,294 soldiers, flanked by conch shell-blowers, drummers, and musicians. Two of the processions involved using the \"Phra Yannamat Sam Lam Khan\" (]golden palanquin with three poles'), an 18th-century seven metric ton palanquin carried by 60 men. The two-century-old sandalwood golden teak urn held Galyani's remains, whose body was seated in upright position, on top of an elaborately decorated fourteen-ton golden carriage.\n\nBoth dressed in white ceremonial dress, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat took part in the procession, on Sanam Luang parade ground. In Uttaradit, black-dressed Thais flocked to the royally-sponsored Wat Klong Poh in the provincial seat to place four hundred thousand sandalwood flowers at the crematorium.\n\nAt 22:00 on 15 November, the king and Queen Sirikit, with the help of a hydraulic tappet, set alight a 40 m (130 ft) high funeral pyre. The US$5.7 m (£3.8 m) temporary royal crematorium, a complex of pavilions constructed on the Sanam Luang parade ground over seven months, had been decorated with flowers, garlands, and carved banana stalks. After the cremation, the funeral buildings were torn down, as they are sombre reminders of a royal death. According to Hindu belief, it is said that the spirit of the princess will then return home to Mount Meru, where all deities eternally live.\n\nThe Galyani Vadhana Building is in Priest Hospital, Bangkok. It has nine storeys and 15,096 m usable area. With Princess Galyani Vadhana's support, the Kidney Foundation of Thailand coordinated with the Ministry of Public Health in its construction. The Government Lottery Office provided funds for it. Following the celebration of the princess's seventy-second birthday in 1995, her permission was sought to name the building after her, which she permitted, and dedicated it on 20 May 1994. The building supports the treatment of terminal chronic renal failure patients with 46 artificial kidney machines.\n\nNaradhiwas Rajanagarindra Road runs through Bang Rak, Sathon, and Yan Nawa Districts of Bangkok. It is built of ferroconcrete with eight sixty meter wide lanes. Its length is 5.115 km from Surawongse Road in Bang Rak District in the southeast and meets Rama III Road in Yan Nawa District. It was included as an approach road project in the fourth Bangkok Development Plan (1992–1996). Upon completion, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration asked for permission to name it for Princess Galyani Vadhana, and the king consented in 1996.\n\nNaradhiwas Rajanagarindra Hospital is a general hospital with 260 beds, in Mueang Narathiwat District, Narathiwat Province. Its floor space is 113,600 m. Originally just a medical station, in 1952 the Ministry of Public Health upgraded it to \"Narathiwat Hospital\". Later when Princess Galyani Vadhana was bestowed the title Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra, the hospital board requested the Ministry of Public Health to give the new hospital a name, and the king named it \"Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Hospital\" on 28 February 1997.\n\nPrincess of Naradhiwas University was established by an act of 9 February 2005 merging all educational institutions in Narathiwat Province. Those institutions were Naradhiwas Technical College, Naradhiwas Agricultural and Technology College, Takbai Vocational College, and Boromarjonani College of Nursing.\n\n\nThe Princess's style and title in full: Somdet Phrachao Phinangthoe Chaofa Galyani Vadhana Krommaluang Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra ()\n\n\n"}

The range of this organism ranges from Africa to the United States. \"B. bennettii\" shares similar characteristics with Toxoplasma, Neospora, and Sarcocystis genera. Lab work on\"B. bennetti\" is conducted at biosafety level 1.\n\n\"Besnoitia bennetti\" originated in Africa, causing besnoitiosis in donkeys and horses there. Currently, the organism exists in Sudan, South Africa, France, the Pyrenees, Mexico, and the United States. The first recorded infection of this species was documented in 1927 in Sudan. The species was believed to have spread from the Nuba Mountains. The first documented case in the United States occurred in 1957, when the species was found in the skin of burros.\n\nThe instance of this species in a medical journal was in 1927, in an article written by S.C.J. Bennett. In an expedition to Sudan, Bennett found four horses that had developed cysts consistent with what was eventually called besnoitiosis. Bennett at first mistakenly believed that the infection he found was caused by species of Sarcocystis or Globidium and that the organism infected cattle in addition to horses. In 1932, the species was placed into the Besnoitia genus by Babudieri. The first instance of an infection in South Africa appeared in a medical journal in 1955. \"B. bennetti\" was discovered in the United States in 1973 in an experimental herd of Mexican burros.\n\nIn infected donkeys, \"B. bennetti\" formed cysts in the eyes, mouth, and testes. The mode of transmission among donkeys has not been determined. Treatments with ponazuril, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitroxinide have been unable to clear infection.\n\nWhile \"B. bennetti\" has only been found to infect donkeys, it has experimentally been shown not to infect mice, rats, gerbils, or cats.\n"}
{"id": "2206647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206647", "title": "Banu Khuza'a", "text": "Banu Khuza'a\n\nThe Banū Khuza’ah ( singular \"Khuzā’ī\") is the name of an Azdite, Qaḥṭānite tribe, which is one of the main ancestral tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. They ruled Mecca for a long period, prior and after the Prophet Muhammad’s rule, and many members of the tribe now live in and around that city, but are also present in significant numbers in other countries, mainly Iraq, Israel, Palestine, and Jordan but also numbers can be found in Lebanon, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and UAE. The tribe acted as the custodians of Mecca alongside the Prophet Muhammad and its members were his personal guardians throughout. Most notably, in Iraq, the tribe was the creator of the Abbasid Empire, one of the greatest in history, as well as the founders of the city of Baghdad. They were the ruling kings of the Emirate of what is now modern-day Iraq, until the invasion of the Ottoman Empire in the late 1800s and were the rulers of the kingdom of the Middle Euphrates until the early-mid 20th century.\n\nThey participated in the Battle of the Trench. The Banu Nadir began rousing the nomads of Najd. The Nadir enlisted the Banu Ghatafan by paying them half of their harvest. This contingent, the second largest, added a strength of about 2,000 men and 300 horsemen led by Unaina bin Hasan Fazari. The Bani Assad also agreed to join, led by Tuleha Asadi. From the Banu Sulaym, the Nadir secured 700 men, though this force would likely have been much larger had not some of its leaders been sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir, who had a pact with Muhammad, refused to join.\n\nOther tribes included the Banu Murra, with 400 men led by Hars ibn Auf Murri, and the Banu Shuja, with 700 men led by Sufyan ibn Abd Shams. In total, the strength of the Confederate armies, though not agreed upon by scholars, is estimated to have included around 10,000 men and six hundred horsemen. At the end of March 627 the army, which was led by Abu Sufyan, marched on Medina.\n\nIn accordance with the plan the armies began marching towards Medina, Meccans from the south (along the coast) and the others from the east. At the same time horsemen from the Banu Khuza'a left to warn Medina of the invading army.\n\nMost traditionalists trace the origins of the tribe to Amr ibn Luḥay al-Khuzā'ī, and agree that, with the other branches of the Azd, they at some point, left Yemen and moved north. 'Amr ibn Luḥay and his clan settled themselves around Mecca. A date of around the 5th century can be set for that settlement, although traditionalists place it at an earlier date by giving particularly long lives to some of its leaders.\n\nThe opinions of genealogists vary concerning the ancestry and origins of the Banu Khuza'ah; some say that they were descended from Qahtan and others say they are from Adnan. We will present both opinions here:\n\nAl-Mubarrid was of the opinion that Khuzā’ah are descendants of ‘Amr bin Rabī’ah, and he was known as Luḥay and belonged to the Azd; Ibn al-Athīr al-Jazarī agrees with him, saying: “They were called Khuzā’ah because they broke away from the Azd when they all left Yemen at the time of the flood of ˁIram” (the breach of the Ma’rib dam). Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī says the same, but states that they are Qaḥṭānites. Al-Qalqashandī states: “Khuzā’ah are a tribe from the Azd, from the Qaḥṭānites.”\n\nIbn ‘Abd al-Birr states that ibn al-Kalbī was of the opinion that:” 'Amr bin Luḥay, for Luḥay was his name, is Rabī’ah ibn Ḥārithah bin ‘Amr; and he is Mā’ al-Samā’ ibn Ḥārithah bin Imra’ al-Qays bin Tha’labah bin Māzin bin al-Azd bin Ghawth bin al-Nābit bin Mālik bin Zayd bin Kaḥlān bin Saba’ bin Yashjab bin Ya’rab bin Qaḥṭān, so he is the ancestor of all of Khuzā’ah, and they broke away from him.\"\n\nIt is suggested that one of the strongest proofs for this is that the Khuzā’ah themselves used to say: “We are the sons of ‘Amr ibn Rabī’ah from the Yemen.”\n\nArabs linguists tended towards the opinion that the name of Khuzā’ah came from the phrase: khaza’a ‘an aṣḥābihi (خزع عن أصحابه ), which means \"he has lagged behind his companions (when they are walking)\"; so they were called this because they were behind their people when they came from Ma’rib.\n\nAl-Zabīdī mentions what ‘Awn ibn Ayūb al-Ansārī stated:\nفَلَمَّا هَبَطْنَا بَطْنَ مُرٍّ تَخَزَعَتْ خُزَاعَةٌ عَنّا فِيْ حُلُوْلِ كَرَاكِرَ (\"Fa-lammā habaṭnā baṭna murrin takhazza'at\" \"khuzā’atun ‘annā fī ḥulūli\" \"Karākira\" : \"And when we dismounted at Baṭn Murr Khuzā'ah had already stayed behind in the camp at Karākir.\")\n\nIt is said that ascribing Khuzā’ah to Qaḥṭān also agrees with this etymology of the name, whereas to say that they are descendants of ‘Adnān makes such an etymology of the name meaningless.\n\nIbn Iṣḥaq is of the opinion that Khuzā’ah are the descendants of ‘Amr ibn Luḥay bin Qum’ah bin Ilyās bin Muḑar bin Nazār bin Ma’d bin ‘Adnān; they would therefore be Muḑarites rather than Qaḥṭanites. Al-Muṣ’ab al-Zubayri also agrees with Ibn Iṣḥaq, saying that Qum’ah is ‘Umayr, father of Khuzā’ah. This is supported by the opinion of Ibn Ḥazm, who related four prophetic traditions (Ḥadīth) substantiating that Khuzā’ah were from Muḑar and not from Qaḥṭān:\n\nḤadīth 1: From Abū Hurayrah that Muhammad said: “’Amr ibn Luḥay bin Qum’ah bin Khandaf is the father of Khuzā’ah.”\n\nḤadīth 2: The statement of Muhammad: “I saw ‘Amr bin Luḥay bin Qum’ah bin Khandaf the father of those sons of Ka’b, and he was dragging his intestines through hellfire.” And those sons of Ka’b are the ones about whom Ibn 'Abbās said: “The Quran was sent down in the dialect of Ka’bs: Ka’b bin Ka’b bin Lu’ayy and Ka’b bin 'Amr bin Luḥay.”\n\nḤadīth 3: The narration of Aktham ibn Abī Ḥabbūn al-Khuzā’ī, when Muhammad said to him, “O Aktham! I saw Rabī’ah ibn Luḥay bin Qum’ah bin Khandaf dragging his intestines in the fire, and I have never seen any man more like him than you; nor more like you than him.” Aktham asked: “Are you afraid that being like him will harm me, o Messenger of Allah?” And he replied: ”No, you are a believer and he was an unbeliever …” And al-Muṣ’ab al-Zubayrī stood by this ḥadīth saying that whatever Muhammad said was the truth. This is also supported by Ibn Khaldūn, who reiterates the statement of Qādi ‘Ayyāḑ: ”What is well known about this Khuzā’ah is that he is ‘Amr bin Luḥay bin Qum’ah bin Ilyās.\n\nḤadīth 4: The ḥadīth of Salamah ibn al-Akwā', who said: “The Messenger of Allah (SAW) passed by a group of people from the tribe of Aslam who were practicing archery.“ And he said to them: ”Throw Banī Ismā’īl, for your father was an archer, and I am with the sons of such-and-such a one …”\n\nIbn Ḥazm said: “Now as for the first, the third and the fourth ḥadīths, they are all extremely authentic and reliable, and they cannot be rejected for the statements of the genealogists and others; and on the basis of these Khuzā’ah was one of the sons of Qum’ah bin Ilyās bin Muḑar.\n\nAl-Suhaylī said that the ḥadīth of Salamah was a strong proof for those who considered Khuzā’ah to be one of the sons of Qum’ah ibn Ilyās. And there is not the slightest doubt that the difference between the different genealogists stems from the fact that Salamah mentioned in the fourth Ḥadīth are the brothers of Khuzā’ah. And among the some more modern scholars who prefer to regard Khuzā’ah as one of the descendants of ‘Adnān is 'Allāmah ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Yaḥyā al-Mu’allamī al-Yamānī.\n\nIn ancient times the tribe of Khuzā’ah was subdivided into a number of phratries (buṭūn):\nAnd Banū al-Muṣṭaliq and Banū al-Ḥayā’ belong to the tribes who formed the Ḥalaf of Ḥabābish in Makkah.\n\nThe closest tribes in lineage to Khuzā’ah are the Ansar (Aws & Khazraj) and Bariq ,Ghassān and Dawasir (Al-Zayed) all of them are from Azd Mazin tribes .\n\nGeographical and historical works mention the locations that Khuzā’ah used to inhabit before and after the coming of Islam, since they were either Makkah, or adjoining it or in the mountains, watering holes and wadis around it. A number of other Arab tribes used to share these places with them, such as the Quraysh in Makkah, and Kinānah in Jabal al-Abwā’ and Murr al-Ẓahrān and Qudayd. The Arab tribes in general often used to move from one area to another in search of water, something that sometimes led to tribes sharing certain spots. And among the campsites of Khuza’ah were:\n\nAfter Hājar (Hagar of the Bible), the wife of the Ibrāhīm (Abraham) and their son Ismā’īl (Ishmael) had settled in Mecca, the tribe of Jurhum, happened to pass through there and agreed with Hājar that they should remain there to in order to get to know her better to help to provide water for her. They settled in Mecca and in the area around. Once Ismā’īl had become a youth he married a woman of the tribe of Jurhum. Ismā’īl was the custodian of the Sacred House (Ka’bah), and after he died he made his son Nābit his successor. And then after Nābit the job was given to his uncles from Jurhum, and with them were the descendants of Ismā’īl. Then Muḑāḑah ibn 'Amr al-Jurhamī assumed the burden of the affairs of the Sacred House.\n\nJurhum’s custodianship of the Sanctuary lasted for a period of time, but they then started to become weaker in faith, putting the continuing sanctity of the Sacred House at peril. They considered all the funds collected at the Sanctuary to be their property, and started to perform sinful acts within its precincts. It came to the point where a man and a woman, called Asāf and Nā’ilah, performed coitus in the Sacred House, and according to the Muslim sources Allah turned them into two stones to punish them for this sacrilegious act.\n\nTheir aggression against the sanctity of the Sanctuary was the catalyst that made the Banū Bakr bin ‘Abd al-Manāf bin Kinānah, descendants of Ismā’īl, join with Khuzā’ah in fighting Jurhum and they expelled them from Mecca.\n\nAfter the Jurhumites had fled, Khuzā’ah became custodians of the Sacred House, passing the duty on from father to son for a long time, five hundred years it is said. The first one of Khuzā’ah to govern the Sacred House was ‘Amr bin Rabī’ah (Luḥay) who travelled to Syria-Palestine (al-Shām) to seek a cure for a disease he was suffering from; he found the people there worshiping idols, and he liked this religion, so he brought back an idol called Hubal back to Mecca and called on the people to worship it. Hubal had the figure of an old man with a long beard and was made of carnelian. Its right hand had been cut off but the Quraysh would later provide it with a hand made of gold. 'Amr ibn Rabī'ah then was the first to change the religion of the Arabs. Muslims historians consider that the people of Mecca were following the monotheistic religion of Ibrāhīm and Ismā'īl up to this point (see Hanif), when polytheism was introduced. 'Amr ibn Luḥay became very famous among the other Arab tribes, because he fed all the pilgrims to the Sacred House, and distributed Yemeni cloaks to them. Lots of the tribes started to visit Mecca on pilgrimage, and took their own idols with them, placing them around the Ka'bah to worship.\n\nIt is narrated that Banū Qays ‘Aylān bin MuDar coveted the Sacred House and they came one day in a great mass, accompanied by some other tribes, with the intention of seizing it. At that time the leader of Banū Qays ‘Aylān was ‘Amr ibn al-Zarb al-'Udwānī. Khuzā’ah went out to fight them, and a battled ensued, and finally the Banū Qays ‘Aylān fled.\n\nSimilarly a group of the Hawāzin also launched a raid on the Banū Ḑāṭir bin Ḥabshah, one of the Banū Khuzā'ah, just after the Hawāzin had attacked the Banū Malūḥ (who belonged to Kinānah); then the Banū Ḑāṭir and a group of Khuzā'ah raided the Hawāzin and killed many men. On another occasion the Hawazin raided Khuza'ah, and the fought at al-MaHSab near Mina; they succeeded in beating the Banu 'Unqa' and some of the Banu DaTir from Khuza'ah.\n\nQuraysh, the descendants of al-Naḑr bin Kinānah, were dispersed at that time both in Mecca and the surrounding area. This changed when Quṣay bin Kilāb got betrothed to Hubay bint Ḥalīl bin Ḥabshah bin Salūl bin Ka’b bin ‘Amr al-Khuzā’ī; he married her and at that time her father was in charge of the Ka’bah, so Quṣay was later able to take over the custody of the Sanctuary. There are three different versions of the story of how Quṣay managed to seize this custody:\n\n1. Ibn Isḥaq states that Quṣay became wealthy, his sons were dispersed all over Mecca, and he was held in great respect. After the death of Ḥalīl, Qusay thought he had more right to govern Mecca than Khuzā’ah, since the tribe of Quraysh were the cream of the sons of Ismā’īl son of Ibrāhīm and he was their pure descendant. The sons of Kinānah and Quraysh joined together to help him to expel Khuzā’ah and Banū Bakr from Mecca. He sent a message to is stepbrother, Razāḥ bin Rabī’ah, asking him to assist, and he did indeed come. Razāḥ rushed to Mecca with his tribe from Quḑā’ah, to help his brother in the war against Khuzā’ah.\n\n2. Al-Azraqī mentions that Ḥalil liked Quṣay, and gave him his daughter’s hand during his lifetime. Quṣay became the father of ‘Abd al-Dār, ‘Abd Manāf and ‘Abd al-‘Uzzā among others. Now when Ḥalīl became old he used to give the key of the Ka’bah to his daughter, and she would pass it to her husband to open up the Sacred House. When Ḥalīl was dying he considered the fact that Quṣay had so many offspring and that they were well established, and he bequeathed him control of the Sanctuary, giving him the key. Now when Khuza’ah found out about this they refused to give the control of the Sacred House to Quṣay, and they took the key from Hubay. Now Quṣay quickly went to his people the Quraysh and Banu Kinānah and sought their help against Khuzā’ah, and he also sent for his brother to come from the territory of Quḑa’ah to assist.\n\n3. Abu Hilāl al-‘Askerī relates that when Ḥalīl became old, he passed control of the Sacred House to Abū Ghabshān Salīm bin ‘Amr al-Khuzā’ī, and one day he and Quṣay were drinking together; now when he became drunk Quṣay bought the control of the Sacred House from him for a skinful of wine and a young camel. As a result there was a saying: “More damaging than the transaction of Abū Ghabshān.”\nThese individual accounts when collated show that Qusay was getting ready to seize the Sacred House from Khuza’ah, and Khuza’ah set out to fight Quṣay, Quraysh, Kinānah and his allies from Quḑaa’ah. There was a fierce battle which was known as “The Day of Abṭaḥ” (\"Yawm Abṭaḥ\"); there were many casualties on both sides but the army of Quṣay was victorious. Finally both sides decided that they should seek a ruling about what to do; they consulted the leader of Banu Kinānah, Ya’mar bin ‘Awf bin Ka’b bin ‘Āmir bin Layth bin Bakr bin ‘Abd Manāt bin Kinānah, and he decide that Quṣay should forget all the injuries sustained by him and his men, and that in recompense for the blood of Khuzā’ah spilled by Quṣay’s army blood money was due; but however Khuza’ah should pass on the rule of Mecca to Quṣay. This event occurred in the 5th century CE.\n\nThe Khuzā'ah remained allies of the Quraysh and in 570, the Year of the Elephant, took part in the battle against Abrahah.\n\nIn 630, the Khuzā'ah were attacked by the Banū Bakr, allies of the Quraysh. Since the Khuzā'ah had recently formed an alliance with Muḥammad ( referred to in the Qur'an, this attack constituted a breach of the Treaty of Ḥudaybīyah of 628, that had brought about a truce between the Muslims and the Quraish and forbade hostilities between the two groups and their respective allies. This led to the conquest of Mecca by the Muslim armies, which occurred without a battle.\n\nThe Banū Mustaliq was a branch of Banū Khuzā'ah. They occupied the territory of Qudayd on the Red Sea shore between Jeddah and Rābigh.\n\nThe genealogy of Muhammad is connected to that of Khuzā’ah in two ways: firstly by way of his third great grandfather ‘Abd Manāf bin Qusay; and also through his marriage to the ‘Mother of the Believers’ Juwayrīyah, daughter of al-Ḥārith al-Khuzā’ī.\n\nAt the time of the Truce of Ḥudaybiyah one of the conditions set down was: ”Whoever wishes to enter into an agreement with Muhammad and into his covenant then he should enter it; and whoever wishes to enter into an agreement with the Quraysh and into their covenant then he should enter it.” And Khuzā’ah leaped up with enthusiasm, saying: “We are in agreement with Muḥamamd and in his covenant!” While the Banū al-Di’l bin Bakr jumped up saying: “We are in agreement with the Quraysh and in their covenant!”\n\nNow while the truce was still holding the Banū al-Di’l bin Bakr took advantage of it, and wanted to take blood revenge from Khuzā’ah for something that had happened in the Pre-Islamic period; they surprised them at a watering hole belonging to Khuzā’ah at al-Watīr to the south of Mecca, and they killed twenty of their men. They were helped in this attack by Quraysh who supplied men and weapons; and Khuzā'ah were driven into the Sacred Territory (Ḥaram), where they were unable to continue fighting.\n\n‘Amr bin Sālim al-Khuzā’ī set out with forty mounted men of Khuzā’ah to go to Muḥammad in order to tell him what had happened to them. And when Muhammad was among the people in the mosque, ‘Amr recited a poem to him about the agreements and affiliations between them and Khuzā'ah.\n\nThen Muḥammad said: “You have our help, O ‘Amr ibn Sālim!” And he looked towards a cloud in the sky, saying: “This will make the victory of the Banū Ka’b easy!”\n\nNawfil ibn Mu’āwiyah al-Di’lī al-Kinānī apologized for his people saying: “The riders are lying to you.” But Muḥammad said: “Never mind about the riders. We have nobody, whether close relatives or not close, in Tihāmah who has been better with us than Khuzā’ah!” Then he continued: “I would not receive succor if I failed to assist Banū Ka’b from the very thing in which I need help.” Muḥammad gathered the army of the Muslims and they went to Mecca and conquered it. This was towards the end of January 630 CE (8 AH).\n\nMany descendants of the tribe still live in their original homeland, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but many members of the tribe live in other countries, such as Palestine, Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain and Jordan.\n\n\n\n\nKhuzā’ah of Tihāmah ‘Asīr\n\nHamid Bin Hamoud Alkhouzai was the ruler, King and Emir of Southern Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The line operated from 1911 until it was decommissioned in 1977, and most of the rolling stock was sold in 1980. It was powered at various times by cable, steam, and diesel.\n\nThe main stretch of railroad for the L&O was only about four miles long. Four rail spurs increased the overall length to approximately seven miles in total.\n\nThe railroad was used for prisoner transport as well as freight for hauling coal to prison-industry sites and removal of finished products and waste. Prisoners were transported to and from the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad line at Pohick Creek, and between sites within the Lorton Reformatory grounds, especially between the workhouse and the brickyard and other prison-industry facilities. Although as many as 60 prisoners at a time were aboard trains running along the prison line, no guns were permitted aboard and no shots were ever fired from the train. The railroad maintained two civilian employees to operate the line — an engineer and a track manager — as well as 19 prison inmate workers.\n\nIn addition to prisoners, the railroad was used to haul coal to the prison brickyard and to transport finished brick out of the prison. Sewage was also hauled out of the prison by trains prior to the extension of sewer facilities to Lorton by the Fairfax County Water Authority.\n\nIn response to prison overcrowding, the District of Columbia purchased ten hospital cars in 1970 that were surplused by the United States Army and parked them on a spur, in order to house additional prisoners without building permanent facilities. The hospital cars were heavily vandalized and security was difficult to maintain in the cars, leading to their abandonment only months after they were placed in use.\n\nIn 1977, the railroad ended service as road transport became cheaper than the costs of maintaining and operating the specialized Lorton and Occoquan line. When the engines were sold in 1980, a company in Alabama refurbished them and one remains in service on a tourist line in West Virginia. The trackage was mostly covered by pavement or recycled for scrap, but portions remained visible along various areas of Lorton.\n\nDuring construction of the I-95 HOV expansion project in the 1980's, the railroad tunnel that went under I-95 and over Pohick Creek was demolished and the tunnel entrances covered over.\n\nIn May 2006, much of the right-of-way was converted into the Gerry Connolly Cross County Trail. The bridge over Giles Run is built on the extant abutments from the railroad.\n\n"}
{"id": "2206664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2206664", "title": "Hurricane Neddy", "text": "Hurricane Neddy\n\n\"Hurricane Neddy\" is the eighth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> eighth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 29, 1996. It was written by Steve Young, directed by Bob Anderson, and features a cameo by Jon Lovitz as Jay Sherman from \"The Critic\". In the episode, a violent hurricane strikes Springfield. By pure chance, the only house destroyed belongs to Ned Flanders. As a result, Ned begins to lose his faith in God and the townspeople around him, leading to a nervous breakdown.\n\nAs Hurricane Barbara approaches Springfield, panicked citizens ransack the Kwik-E-Mart. After the storm, the Simpsons leave their basement to find their home unscathed. Their next-door neighbor, Ned Flanders, emerges from a heap of rubble and sees that his house is destroyed, forcing the Flanders family to take shelter in the church basement. Ned is further discouraged after learning that his business, The Leftorium, was looted after the storm. Distraught, Ned begins to believe that God is punishing him like Job. In the church sanctuary, Ned wonders aloud why God spared them the storm's wrath while directing it at him.\n\nThe next day, Marge escorts the Flanders family back to their house, which the people of Springfield have rebuilt as a surprise. Ned's joy soon turns to dismay when he finds their shoddy work has made the house barely habitable. When Homer leans on the front door, the entire house collapses. After one of the lenses in his glasses breaks, Ned is unable to contain his rage any longer and snaps and verbally attacks Springfield's residents, pointing out their many flaws.\n\nWorried he is losing his mind, Ned voluntarily commits himself to a mental hospital. He is visited by his childhood psychiatrist, Dr. Foster, who recalls Ned's childhood as an out-of-control brat raised by beatnik parents. Ned's treatment involved eight months of continuous spanking by Dr. Foster. The treatment left Ned unable to express anger until the losses he suffered from the storm made him erupt in repressed rage.\n\nDr. Foster realizes that his earlier approach was flawed and enlists Homer to help Ned express his emotions. Dr. Foster thinks Homer is perfect for this treatment because of his and Ned's mutual dislike. After several scripted insults fail to rile Ned's anger, Homer begins to improvise. When Homer disparages his apparent like of everything, Ned realizes he hates two things: the post office and his parents. Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and releases him from the asylum.\n\nOutside the hospital, Ned is greeted by the townsfolk of Springfield. Ned vows that if any of them does something that offends him, he will tell them instead of stifling his anger. Dr. Foster tells him this is a healthy boundary, but suggests Ned ease up after he tells the crowd he will run them down with his car if they make him extremely angry — which makes Homer observe Ned really is crazy.\n\nSteve Young, a writer for the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", was brought in as a freelance writer to write the episode. The writers wanted to explore what made Flanders tick and examine what made him act the way he does. The original idea came from George Meyer, who had also wanted an episode about Flanders' faith being tested. One of the key story points came from his friend Jack Handey, a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\", who wanted to do a sketch about a down-on-his-luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him, but make very bad shoes. Likewise, it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild Flanders' house, but do a bad job and provoke an outburst.\n\nA caricature of John Swartzwelder can be seen shutting the door of a room in Calmwood Mental Hospital. Later in the episode, during the scene where the townsfolk are welcoming Ned back, someone can be seen holding a sign that says \"Free John Swartzwelder\". During the sequence where Flanders yells at the town, a man with a ponytail and wearing a white shirt who is a caricature of Bob Anderson can be seen.\n\nThe scene at the beginning of the episode, in which the people of Springfield mob the Kwik-E-Mart, is based on the events of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Todd is wearing a Butthole Surfers T-shirt; however, the censors only allowed the letters \"Buttho Surfers\" to appear onscreen, partially obscuring the band's offensive name. The opening sequence is parodied during the storm when the word \"Hurricane\" appears onscreen, accompanied by the same chorus which sings the show's name. Jay Sherman from \"The Critic\", who had previously appeared in \"A Star Is Burns\", can be seen in the mental hospital repeatedly saying his catchphrase, \"It stinks\"; Ms. Botz from \"Some Enchanted Evening\" appears as a patient in a nearby room. A small door at the end of the hallway in Flanders' rebuilt house echoes the improbably small hallway in the film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Hurricane Neddy\" finished 18th in ratings for the week of December 23–29, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 8.7, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households. It was the second-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\".\n\nMarge's line, \"Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If You stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend You to all our friends\", was cited by journalist Mark Pinsky as an example of how \"Simpson family members are both defined and circumscribed by religion.\" Journalist Ben Rayner speculated that some fans, whom he called \"nerds\", would want an explanation of \"how Barney fit through that tiny door to the 'master bedroom' in the rebuilt Flanders family home.\"\n\n"}

Lim\n\nRoseller Tarroza Lim (February 9, 1915 – July 5, 1976) was a Filipino politician who served as a member of the Senate and House of Representatives from 1949 to 1963. He also served as Court of Appeals Justice from his appointment in 1973 until his death. Lim was known as the \"\"Great Filibuster,\"\" after he filibustered for more than 18 hours in an attempt to prevent the election of Ferdinand Marcos as President of the Senate.\n\nRoseller Lim was born to Antonio Lim and Mercedes Tarroza. He earned his Associate in Arts (AA) program in History & law degree from Silliman University in 1940, and passed the bar the same year. He married Amy Schuck of Jolo, Sulu and had five children — Rosamy, Mercibel, Victoria, Roseller Jr., and Amy.\n\nLim was a member of the Nacionalista Party and was first elected as representative of the Lone District of Zamboanga in 1949. In his first term in office, he authored the law that divided the province of Zamboanga into the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur. He won another term in 1953, this time as representative of the Lone District of Zamboanga del Sur. Halfway through his term, he ran and won as senator in 1955, to complete the unexpired two years of Carlos P. Garcia's term, who was elected Vice President in 1953. Lim was instrumental in the election of the Philippines into the International Labour Organization governing body in 1957. He won reelection in 1957 for a full six-year term, but lost in his bid for another term in 1963. Lim also authored the \"Barrio Charter Law,\" which served as the basis of the current barangay governments.\n\nIn April 1963, Liberal Senator Ferdinand Marcos contested the presidency of the Senate against long-time Senate President Eulogio Rodriguez of the Nacionalista Party. The Senate was then composed of 12 Liberals, 10 Nacionalistas and two independents who caucus with the latter. Shortly before the Senate adjourned, Lim took the floor to buy time to wait for the arrival from the United States, of fellow Nacionalista Senator Alejandro Almendras. Lim had to stand the entire time, leaning only on the podium on occasions. He only had water nearby to sustain him and was even prohibited from going to the comfort room; forcing him to relieve in his pants. Upon learning of Almendras' arrival in the session hall, Lim ended his filibustering after 18 hours and 30 minutes. Immediately after he was able to cast his vote for Rodriguez, Lim was carried out of the session hall on a stretcher due to exhaustion. Only to find out later that Almendras voted for Marcos.\n\nWhen Marcos bolted from the Liberals to the Nacionalistas to run as president in the 1965 election, Lim supported President Diosdado Macapagal of the rival Liberal Party. When Marcos won the election, Lim transferred to the Liberals. In 1970, Lim was elected to the 1971 constitutional convention.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 6, 1997. It was written by Rachel Pulido and directed by Susie Dietter. The episode establishes the long-term relationship between Seymour Skinner and Edna Krabappel. Bart witnesses a romantic moment between Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel and acts as a snitch for them. However, they later embarrass him and he exposes their romance to the public.\n\nMartin Prince invites his classmates to his birthday party, but it ends badly after most of the partygoers get food poisoning and leave by ambulance. After the party, Bart sees Principal Seymour Skinner and Edna Krabappel kissing in Martin's pink playhouse. Bart plans to reveal what he saw, but Edna and Seymour fear they will be fired if anyone discovers their romance. They swear him to secrecy in exchange for putting Milhouse's name on his permanent record.\n\nEdna and Seymour use Bart as their gofer so they can exchange romantic messages. Bart is humiliated in front of his classmates after Seymour forces him to say \"I love you, Edna Krabappel\" aloud as if the message were his own. Fed up, Bart gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and opens the door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.\n\nWord quickly spreads throughout Springfield, with the story the students tell growing more illicit and exaggerated. After hearing his son Ralph's risqué version involving the two \"making babies\", Chief Wiggum reports it to Superintendent Chalmers. Chalmers gives Seymour an ultimatum: either he ends his relationship with Edna or they both will be fired. Seymour decides that love trumps his professional goals, so Chalmers fires them and demands they leave the building by day's end.\n\nBart feels guilty when he learns that Edna and Seymour have lost their jobs. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for embarrassing him, Bart encourages him to stand up for himself. With Bart's help, Seymour and Edna barricade themselves inside the school, contact the media and make their demands: they want their jobs back and the townspeople to stop interfering with their relationship. When several parents protest that their children saw them having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet, Seymour insists that is untrue because he is a 44-year-old virgin. Everyone is speechless, but they think it must be true because it is so embarrassing for anyone to admit. Realizing that they have overreacted, the residents leave peacefully.\n\nChalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna, but asks them to \"keep the lewdness at a minimum\" during school hours. They thank Bart for helping them but tell him they are breaking up, fearing the entire town judging their relationship publicly. When a disappointed Bart leaves, they observe grade-school children will believe anything they are told before entering the janitor's closet for another tryst.\n\nThe idea of Skinner and Krabappel becoming a couple had been around since the days when Mike Reiss and Al Jean were show runners. The episode's writer Rachel Pulido took some of the inspiration for this episode from \"Bart the Lover\", specifically Mrs. Krabappel's line to Bart about refusing to date Principal Skinner because, \"his mommy won't let him out to play\". The Mathmagician is based on Bill Gates. The cakes in Agnes Skinner's cake book were designed to accurately resemble the real life versions of them. Homer using his megaphone to talk to Marge and Lisa, who were standing next to him, was ad-libbed by Dan Castellaneta. A deleted scene featured an awkward moment at Martin's party, between Bart, Milhouse and Martin, when the latter introduces the two to his parents.\n\nMrs. Krabappel has a candle which resembles Charlie Brown, a character from \"Peanuts\". At the Aztec theater, a movie by Tom Berenger was played. It is implied by Superintendent Chalmers' comment \"You think they actually filmed this in Atlanta?\" and from the commentary that the movie is \"The Big Chill\". In trying to force Edna and Seymour out of the school, the Springfield police attempts to flood the area with music. This is similar to a tactic that the US troops used during Operation Just Cause in an attempt to force Manuel Noriega out of the Vatican embassy in Panama City. However, in this case, romance-themed music was played, which was \"Embraceable You\" by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin. Edna and Seymour's dance poses were taken from Orlando Baeza, who was the assistant director for this episode.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Grade School Confidential\" finished 57th in ratings for the week of March 31 - April 6, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 7.7, equivalent to approximately 7.5 million viewing households. It was the fifth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\", \"Party of Five\", \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" and \"Melrose Place\".\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \"A delightful episode that finally brings to fruition one of the series' longest running gags: Edna and Seymour's mutual attraction. What is doubly refreshing is that it remains a constant in the subsequent episodes.\" The scene in which Agnes Skinner shows Bart her cake book is one of Matt Groening's all-time favorite scenes.\n\n"}

Bose has appeared in Bengali films such as \"Mr. and Mrs. Iyer\", \"Kalpurush\", \"Anuranan\", \"Antaheen\", \"Laptop\" and \"The Japanese Wife\". He has also appeared in Hindi films such as \"Pyaar Ke Side Effects\", \"Maan Gaye Mughal-e-Azam\", \"Jhankaar Beats\", \"Kucch Luv Jaisaa\", \"Chameli\" and \"Shaurya\". He also played the antagonist in the Tamil thriller \"Vishwaroopam\" (2013) and its sequel. \"Time\" magazine named him \"the superstar of Indian arthouse cinema\" while \"Maxim\" named him \"the Sean Penn of Oriental cinema\". for his work in parallel cinema films like \"English, August\" and \"Mr. and Mrs. Iyer\". He is also notable for his social activism: he participated in the relief efforts that followed the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami and is also the founder of the anti-discrimination NGO, The Foundation.\n\nRahul Bose was born to father Rupen and mother Kumud Bose on 27 July 1967.\n\nBose's first acting role was at the age of six when he played the lead in a school play, \"Tom, the Piper's Son\". As a child he took an interest in sports after his mother introduced him to boxing and rugby union. He also played cricket and was coached by cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi.\n\nHe is an alumnus of the Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai. After being rejected by a number of American universities, Bose attended Sydenham College. While at the college he played on the school's rugby team and competed in the Western India Championships, winning a silver medal in boxing. After his mother's death in 1987, Bose began working as a copywriter at Rediffusion and was later promoted to advertising creative director. Bose left the job to become a full-time actor after the release of his first film, \"English, August\".\n\nBose started his acting career on the Mumbai stage in Rahul D'Cunha's \"Topsy Turvey\" and \"Are There Tigers In The Congo?\". D'Cunha's aunt was the casting director for director Dev Benegal's film \"English, August\" and suggested that Bose should play the lead role. After filming a screen test, Benegal decided to cast him as civil servant Agastya Sen. Based on the novel of the same name by Upamanyu Chatterjee, \"English, August\" was one of the first Hinglish films and gained Bose international recognition when it became the first Indian film to be purchased by 20th Century Fox and won several awards at international film festivals.\n\nAfter \"English, August\" Bose found work in television; he was offered a role in India's first English-language television serial, \"A Mouthful of Sky\" and also co-hosted BBC World's \"Style!\" with Laila Rouass. In 1998 he appeared in Kaizad Gustad's \"Bombay Boys\" with Naseeruddin Shah and starred in Dev Benegal's second film, \"Split Wide Open\". To prepare for his role as a roving water vendor, Bose lived in Mumbai's slums and observed a drug dealer for two weeks. He later cited this time—along with the 2002 Gujarat riots—as the beginning of the awakening of his social conscience. Although \"Split Wide Open\" was controversial in India because of its depictions of sexual abuse, Bose received the Silver Screen Award for Best Asian Actor at the 2000 Singapore International Film Festival for his performance. He also performed abroad in the Leicester Haymarket in England where he starred in the English version of Tim Murari's play, \"The Square Circle\".\n\nIn 1997, Bose was cast to play the role of Saleem Sinai in the BBC adaptation of Salman Rushdie's novel \"Midnight's Children\". The project was eventually canceled after the Indian and Sri Lankan governments refused to allow filming.\nAfter seeing Bose in \"English, August\", director Govind Nihalani cast him in the villain role opposite Ajay Devgan in the mainstream film \"Thakshak\". The film was not a financial success, although Bose received positive reviews.\n\nBose also appeared as \"Vikal\" a villain in the 1998 Science fiction TV series Captain Vyom\n\nIn 2001, Bose made his directorial debut with \"Everybody Says I'm Fine!\". Starring Rehaan Engineer and Koel Purie and featuring Bose in a supporting role, \"Everybody\" received mixed reviews from critics, but won Bose the runner-up John Schlesinger Award for best directorial debut at the 2003 Palm Springs International Film Festival. In 2002, Bose starred opposite Konkona Sen Sharma in Aparna Sen's art film \"Mr. and Mrs. Iyer\". The film, a critique of communal violence, was a critical success and won several awards at international film festivals as well as three National Film Awards.\n\nIn 2003, Bose entered mainstream Bollywood cinema with \"Jhankaar Beats\" in which he played one of two friends, R.D. Burman fans who are obsessed with winning a music competition. Boosted by a successful soundtrack, \"Jhankaar Beats\" was a surprise hit in urban multiplexes and went on to win several awards for its music. The same year, Bose appeared in another Bollywood film, \"Mumbai Matinee\" which saw a UK release. He starred in \"Chameli\" opposite Kareena Kapoor, playing a wealthy chain-smoking Mumbai banker who is stranded in the monsoon rains with a prostitute. The film was not a box office success, but won several Filmfare and IIFA awards.\n\nHe was the screenwriter of Hero Bhakti Hi Shakti Hai of Hungama TV in 2005.\n\nBose's second film pairing with Konkona Sen Sharma, \"15 Park Avenue\" released in January 2006. Directed by Aparna Sen and filmed in English, \"15 Park Avenue\" won the 2006 National Film Award for Best Feature Film in English.\n\nWith his next effort, the romantic comedy \"Pyaar Ke Side Effects\", Bose moved once more into mainstream Bollywood cinema. The film follows the rocky relationship of Bose's commitment phobic Mumbai DJ Sid and his Punjabi girlfriend, Trisha played by Mallika Sherawat. Critics noted the freshness of Bose's narration style which involves breaking the fourth wall, a device not commonly used in Indian cinema. The film opened well in multiplexes and was a moderate financial success, eventually ranking among the top-grossing films of 2006. Both Bose and Sherawat received positive reviews for their performances. Sherawat and Bose also starred together in another Bollywood comedy, \"Maan Gaye Mughal-e-Azam\" (2008), which was a commercial and critical failure.\n\nIn 2006, Bose starred in the first of a trio of Bengali films, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's \"Anuranan\". \"Anuranan\" was well received on the festival circuit and ran successfully for three months in Bengal. It was then dubbed into Hindi and released nationally. \"Kaalpurush\", Bose's second Bengali film, was released commercially in April 2008. \"Kaalpurush\" details a father-son relationship and earned writer-director Buddhadeb Dasgupta a National Film Award for Best Feature Film.

His role as a gay man harassed by the police in \"I Am\" was appreciated by critics.\n\nHe appeared in Deepa Mehta's version of \"Midnight's Children\" where he played the role of General Zulfikar. He also played the villain in the 2013 Tamil film \"Vishwaroopam\". Naren Weiss who was 19 years old at the time, acted opposite Bose in all of his scenes for \"Vishwaroopam\", and credited Bose for working with him during filming. He was scheduled to begin shooting his adaptation of Mohsin Hamid's novel, \"Moth Smoke\" in early 2010, but the project was postponed after the film's financial backers pulled out. In 2013, he also played opposite Konkona Sen Sharma again in Suman Mukhopadhyay's \"Shesher Kabita\". In 2017, he directed, produced and acted in the biopic \"Poorna\" about the youngest girl to climb Mount Everest.\n\n\nIn 1998, Bose was part of the first Indian national rugby team to play in an international event, the Asian Rugby Football Union Championship. He has played both scrum-half and right-winger positions. In an interview with \"Daily News & Analysis\", Bose announced that he would not return to the team for the 2009 season.\n\nBose assisted in the relief efforts in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. As a result of this work, Bose launched the Andaman and Nicobar Scholarship Initiative through his NGO, The Foundation. The scholarship program provides for the education of underprivileged children from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nBose is associated with several charitable organizations such as Teach for India, Akshara Centre, Breakthrough, Citizens for Justice and Peace and the Spastics Society of India.

She was also a member of the House of Mahidol, which is descended from the Chakri Dynasty, and was originated by Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, son of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). She was the mother of Princess Galyani Vadhana, the Princess of Naradhiwas, King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII), and King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX).\n\nHer given name was Sangwan (), while her formal name and title were Somdet Phra Srinagarindra Boromarajajonani (). In Thailand, she was affectionately called Somdet Ya (), \"the Royal Grandmother\". By the various hill tribe people, to whom she was a special patron, she was called Mae Fah Luang (), \"Royal Mother from the Sky\" or \"The Heavenly Royal Mother\".\n\nPrincess Srinagarindra was born Sangwan Chukramol on 21 October 1900, in Nonthaburi Province. Her family was of Thai Chinese descent. She was the third of four children; her elder brother and sister died while still young. By the time she was nine years old, she had also lost both her parents and had only one remaining sibling, a younger brother named Thomya. Her aunt, Suay, who earned a living by making sweets and rolling cigarettes, became her guardian.\n\nSangwan's mother had taught the girl to read. With this elementary skill, she enrolled at the all-girls school of Wat Anongkharam, a nearby temple whose abbot recognised the need for girls to have an education. She then studied at Suksanari, but left after only a month due to lack of funds. She nonetheless maintained her reading habit by regularly visiting her aunt’s friend, who ran a library of books for rent. She read the Thai classics, such as \"Inao\", \"Phra Aphai Mani\", and \"Sangsilchai\".\n\nAt the suggestion of a relative, young Sangwan was sent to live with Chan Saeng-xuto, another relative and a nanny to Princess Valaya Alongkorn, the Princess of Petchaburi, daughter of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) and Queen Savang Vadhana (later Queen Sri Savarindira, The Queen Grandmother). At the age of seven, Sangwan found herself at the royal court. Her only duty at that time was to present herself at a twice-daily audience with the princess—when she woke up, and again in the evening. Every now and then, she would join the princess's entourage when she went for an audience with her mother, Queen Savang Vadhana, at Suan Hongsa Royal Villa on the grounds of Dusit Palace.\n\nShortly afterwards, she was sent to Satri Wittaya School, while she lived with Huan Hongsakul, the nanny of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, the younger brother of Princess Valaya Alongkorn.\n\nAfter an accident with a sewing needle, Sangwan was sent to Lord (\"Phraya\") Damrong Baedyakhun, the court physician for surgery. She stayed at his house while continuing her schooling at Satri Wittaya School. Sensing that she was feeling listless and unhappy, he asked her if she would be interested in studying nursing. Sangwan answered at once that she would be.\n\nSiriraj Hospital had opened a school of midwifery and nursing, but despite the minimum requirement of being able to read and write, had not been able to attract many students. As a further incentive, each student was paid 15 baht per month, sufficient to live on for the entire month.\n\nSangwan enrolled as a student of Siriraj School for Midwifery and Nursing in 1913, when she was thirteen. She was two years under the minimum age requirement, but the school admitted her on the strength of her qualifications. She was a scholarship student, and on accepting the 15 baht monthly for her expenses, she had agreed to work for the hospital for three years. Upon graduation in 1916, she joined the nursing team at the hospital.\n\nThe following year, Prince Rangsit Prayursakdi, the Prince of Chainat (son of King Chulalongkorn and adopted son of Queen Savang Vadhana, half-brother of Princess Valaya Alongkorn and Prince Mahidol Adulyadej), director of the Royal Medical College of Siriraj Hospital, selected two doctors and two nurses to further their studies in the United States. These scholarship students were expected to return to teach future generations of medical students and advance the medical profession in Thailand. The medical scholarships were provided by Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, then a first-year student at Harvard Medical School, while the nursing scholarships were provided by his mother, Queen Savang Vadhana. One of the two nurses selected was Sangwan. Her preparations for this trip included a six-month intensive English course with Miss Edna Sarah Cole, headmistress of Kullasatri Wang Lang School for girls (later to become Wattana Wittaya Academy).\n\nFor her passport, Sangwan needed a surname, the use of which was not a regular practice in Thailand until 1913 during the reign of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI). As her father was dead, she took the surname of Lee Talaphat, who was in the service of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej. Her surviving younger brother registered himself as Thomya Chukramol.\n\nSangwan Talaphat left Bangkok on 13 August 1917 on the ship \"Kuala\" with almost 20 other Thai students. The trip took them to Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Hawaii, and after six weeks, the group reached San Francisco. From there, she went to live with an American family, the Adamsens of Berkeley, California, for a year, attending Emerson School with her friend Ubol Palakawongse na Ayudhya, a member of the nobility. She also attended Sunday school to learn the ways of the Christian faith.\n\nIn 1918, they joined eight other Thai students travelling to Boston, Massachusetts. As the train drew into Boston station on 21 September 1918, Prince Mahidol was waiting to welcome them, though Sangwan had no idea who he was. Furthermore, she had no idea that her presence had already made an impact on the young prince, who, according to his roommate, Pradit Sukhum (later Lord (Luang) Sukhum Nayapradit), arrived home after two in the morning, shook him awake saying, \"The two girls have arrived. Sangwan is really very pretty, you know.\"\n\nPrince Mahidol Adulyadej had arranged for the girls to stay with the Armstrong family in Hartford, Connecticut, and to attend North Western Grammar School to perfect their English reading, writing, and speaking skills. During this time, Prince Mahidol maintained close interest in Sangwan's development, making frequent visits to Hartford. Their strolls in the park to observe the flowers reflected Sangwan's lifelong love of plants and concern for the natural environment.\n\nApproval was granted to the union between Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla Nagarindra, and Sangwan Talabhat, and in 1919, he presented her with a diamond ring on a heart-shaped setting in a private ceremony. Thirty years later, this same ring would be presented by his son, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, to his bride-to-be, Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara. After their engagement, Prince Mahidol bade his fiancée move to Cambridge where she lived with the Williston sisters, Emily and Constance, who tutored her in algebra, Latin, French, and English. The prince also assigned an American woman to take Sangwan on guided tours of museums and art galleries, and explain to her the significance of the various exhibits. The royal wedding of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej and Sangwan Talapat (later Srinagarindra) was held at Sa Pathum Palace on 10 September 1920. The ceremony was presided over by Prince Mahidol Adulyadej's half-brother, King Vajiravudh.\n\nPrince Mahidol Adulyadej and Mom Sangwan Mahidol na Ayudhya had three children, a daughter and two sons:\n\nThe marriage was followed by a visit to various European countries before the couple eventually returned to the United States. Prince Mahidol resumed his studies in public health at Harvard and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston and arranged for his wife to take a preparatory course for nursing at Simmons College, where she studied chemistry and nutrition. Upon passing the test at the end of the semester, she went on to study school health at MIT, entering in the summer semester.\n\nIn Boston, they were simply known as \"Mr and Mrs Mahidol Songkla\", living in a two-bedroom flat at 63 Longwood Avenue. Apart from their studies, they were both closely involved in the activities of the Siam Association of USA under Royal Patronage, which had been established by the prince. They would often host meals for other Thai students; she did the cooking, while he washed the dishes.\n\nPrince Mahidol Adulyadej was beset with kidney problems during his last year at medical school. Despite chronic health problems, he managed to graduate with honours. Immediately after his finals, he suffered from acute appendicitis requiring immediate surgery. As soon as he was well enough to travel, he and his family went to Europe again for an extended stopover, returning eventually to Siam in 1928 and taking up residency at Sra Pathum Palace. Prince Mahidol died on 24 September 1929 at Sapathum Palace.\n\nAt her husband's death, Mom Sangwan was just 29 years old, occupied with raising her three young children ranging in age from six and four to one year, nine months. At that time, her daughter, Princess Galyani Vadhana was studying at Rajini School. As soon as they were old enough, her sons were also sent to school, Prince Ananda Mahidol attended kindergarten at Mater Dei School and transferred to Debsirin School, while Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej remained in kindergarten at Mater Dei School.\n\nOn 24 June 1932, the 1932 Siamese Revolution brought about the end of Thailand's absolute monarchy, and the start of a constitutional monarchy. Some members of the royal family resigned their government posts, and others left the country to live overseas until the political scene had calmed.\n\nQueen Sri Savarindira, the Queen Aunt, later titled the \"Queen Grandmother\", consulted with her daughter, Princess Valaya Alongkorn, the Princess of Petchaburi and her adopted son, Prince Rangsit Prayursakdi, the Prince of Chainat, about the suitable course of action for her grandchildren, especially Prince Ananda Mahidol. Prince Rangsit recommended Lausanne, Switzerland, a decision that Mom Sangwan approved due to its mild climate, scenery, and hospitable people. It was also said to be one of the most favoured places of her much-travelled husband Prince Mahidol. In April 1933, Mom Sangwan and her children left for Switzerland, together with a small entourage among whom was a young relative named Boonruen Sopoj, who later became Dame (Thanpuying) Boonruen Choonhavan, the widow of Prime Minister General Chatichai Choonhavan.\n\nWhile Mom Sangwan and her children were living in Switzerland, King Prajadhipok (Rama VII)) abdicated on 2 March 1935, relinquishing his right to appoint an heir to the throne.\n\nAccording to the palace Law regarding succession to the throne as promulgated by King Vajiravudh in 1924, the next in line was the son of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla Nagarindra. Thus Prince Ananda Mahidol, as yet only nine years old, was declared the eighth monarch of the Chakri Dynasty.\n\nSince the new king was only nine years old, parliament unanimously appointed Prince Aditya Dibabha Abhakara (son of Prince Abhakara Kiartiwongse, the Prince of Chumphorn) and Lord (Chao Phraya) Yomaraj (Pan Sukhum) as regents until the king came of age. On this occasion, Mom Sangwan was conferred the title of \"Princess Mother Sri Sangwan\", a title that still denoted her commoner status.\n\nFor various reasons including security in line with their new status, the family moved to a new house, names \"Villa Vadhana\" in Pully, near Lausanne.\n\nThe king and his younger brother, Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej went to a school called Ecole Nouvelle de la Suisse Romande. Although in his own country he was king, at school in Switzerland he was simply, Ananda Mahidol, son of Madame S. Mahidol, a student receiving no more privileges than any other student here.\n\nThree years after ascending the throne, the young King Ananda Mahidol returned to visit his country and his people for the first time. Upon their return, Princess Sri Sangwan was elevated to the ranks of royalty with the title \"Her Royal Highness\". Throughout the two months that the young king appeared in the midst of his people, the Thais had a chance to admire his maturity and his demeanor, which was most becoming to a monarch and far beyond his years.\n\nThe princess mother took advantage of this brief sojourn in their homeland to make sure that the king saw as much as he could of the important temples and historic sites in Bangkok and the environs, and of the national arts and culture. She also kindled his desire to help others, to contribute to charitable projects including public health and medicine. The king donated a sum from his privy purse to build the Ananda Mahidol Hospital in Lopburi Province, while his siblings donated toward a health centre in Samut Sakhon Province.\n\nIn January 1939, King Ananda Mahidol and his family bade farewell once again to their homeland and returned to Switzerland.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II in 1939 had repercussions on the Mahidol family. They received ration coupons like other Swiss families. They had to use ash for washing instead of soap, and the young king travelled to school by bicycle. The princess mother made her own jam from fruit such as strawberries, apples, and pears that she picked from her own garden.\n\nShe kept up her late husband's tradition of inviting Thai students for meals on Saturdays. The increasing number of Thai students in Switzerland, who had moved there from war-torn Belgium, France, and Italy, meant that they had to take turns as guests of the princess mother. Her support to the students extended to lending, or even giving, them money if their funds from Thailand arrived late.\n\nThe young king and his brother remained at Ecole Nouvélle de la Suisse Romande until 1941, boarding at the school during their last two years there, as it was their mother's wish for them to learn how to take care of themselves. Meanwhile, Princess Galyani Vadhana was attending an international school in Geneva.\n\nThe princess mother made a point of hiring an English governess to teach English to the king. She also made sure her children kept up with their Thai language and culture studies with a tutor, Prueng Siribhatra, who was sent by the Thai government. The family lived in Switzerland until all three children were graduated.\n\nOn 29 November 1945, the family returned to Thailand, this time travelling by plane. Six days later, they arrived. As they stepped off the plane, the Thai public witnessed, not two young schoolboys dressed in shorts, but two mature and dignified young men.\n\nThe Thai government requested that the king postpone his return to Switzerland in order to present the new constitution to the nation on 9 May 1946, and to open parliament on 1 June. He acquiesced, and the return trip to Switzerland was scheduled for 13 June 1946. But the trip was not to be. On the morning of 9 June 1946, only four days before he was due to travel to Switzerland, King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII) died at Boromphiman Throne Hall, Grand Palace, Bangkok. Though the Siamese police director general originally told an emergency session of the legislature that the king's death was accidental, experts have since testified that regicide is the most likely cause of death due to the king being found flat on his back with his Colt pistol found a small distance from his body, but nearer his non-dominant hand. In February 1955, three of the late-king's attendants: his secretary Senator Chaleo Patoomros and two pages, Nai Chit and Butr Paramasrin, were executed by Phibun's regime on charges of conspiracy to kill the king after a long and confusing trial. Today it is acknowledged that these charges were probably baseless, but the truth of the matter remains a mystery that is not discussed within Thailand.\n\nOn the same day as King Ananda Mahidol's death, by parliament’s unanimous decision, Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej, was invited to accede to the throne as King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) of Thailand, the ninth monarch of the Chakri Dynasty\n\nOn 19 August 1946, the princess mother accompanied the new king back to Switzerland, where he resumed his studies at the University of Lausanne. He switched his choice of subjects from science to political science, law and economics, in order to better suit his new priorities.\n\nOn 4 October 1948, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was badly hurt in a motoring accident, requiring hospitalization.\n\nNot long afterwards, on 12 August 1949, the Thai people learned that the king had become engaged to Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, the eldest daughter of \"His Serene Highness Prince\" (Mom Chao) Nakkhatra Mangkala Kitiyakara (later to become His Highness the Prince of Chuntaburi II Suranath), the Thai ambassador of the Court of St. James's, England, and Mom Luang Bua Sanidvongse.\n\nWhen King Bhumibol Adulyadej returned to Thailand from his studies in Switzerland in 1951 with his wife, Queen Sirikit, and their first daughter, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, the princess mother remained in Lausanne. She returned only periodically between 1952 and 1963 in order to attend significant functions or events, such as the birth of her grandchildren, the illness and subsequent death of Queen Sri Savarindira, the Queen Grandmother, or the ordination of her son. For these visits, she would stay only one or two months at a time, and only stayed for extended periods when the occasion demanded. On the king's state visit to 14 European countries and the United States in 1960, she remained in Thailand for six months, acting as Regent of Thailand during the king's absence, just as she did during subsequent state visits overseas until 1967.\n\nAs regent, the princess mother carried out various official duties on behalf of the king, including accepting diplomatic credentials from newly posted ambassadors, conferring degrees on university graduates, presiding at religious ceremonies and putting her signature to several important legislative acts. She was the third female regent of the Rattanakosin era, the first being Queen Saovabha Phongsri during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (later became Queen Sri Bajrindra, the Queen Mother), and Queen Sirikit early on in the present reign. In the capacity, she put her signature to a number of important laws and declarations, including the Suppression of Prostitution Act of 1960, and the first National Economic Development Plan, 1961–1966.\n\nA trip to northern Thailand in 1964 helped change her routine. Not long after the Bhubing Palace in Chiang Mai Province was completed, the king invited the princess mother for a visit. As was her habit in Switzerland, the princess mother went for long treks through the woods behind the palace, enjoying the flora and fauna, and stopping in villages en route. It was then that she discovered the poverty of the villages in remote areas. There was a lack of schools and health services. Even the border patrol police, who acted as guides and also provided security for her on the trips, were very poorly paid, and received no \"per diem\" supplement for services rendered over and above normal duties. Her observations of the precarious economic situation of the rural areas, prompted the princess mother to make regular visits to the remotest areas of the kingdom, starting in 1964.\n\nIn 1932, when her children had started school and she had more time on her hands, she set up an American-style \"sewing circle\", inviting close acquaintances to join the group. Among the members of the circle were Mom Chao Sipphanphansanur Sohnakul, Thanpuying Prayong Sanidvongs na Ayudhya, Khunying Chalaem Puranasiri, Khunying Srivisarnvaja, Khunying Prem, Damrongbaedyakhun, Thanpuying Poa Anurakshraja mondira, and expatriate wives such as Mrs. Zimmerman, Mrs. Davis, Mrs. Langesen, Mrs. Nederguard, Mrs. Pendleton and Mrs. Reeve, whose husbands were missionaries or lecturers at Chulalongkorn University.\n\nThe sewing circle members started by making their own clothes, then making clothes for poor children at various hospitals. They met once a week, each member taking turns hosting tea at home between 16:00-18:00.\n\nIt soon became a procedure for the princess mother to use her own money to purchase items for poor villages during her increasingly frequent upcountry visits. These gifts included tee-shirts, towels, multipurpose \"pha khao ma\" cloth, and stationery for schoolteachers; school uniforms and stationery for schoolchildren; and pha khao ma, sarongs, needles and thread, medicine, tinned food, and dried foodstuffs for villagers. Children received toys suitable for their ages.\n\nShe also set up with her own personal funds a number of foundations, most notably the Border Patrol Police Support Foundation and the New Life Foundation for those recovering from leprosy or mental illness.\n\nApart from her own funds, the money for these various projects came from the sale of handicrafts made through projects initiated by the princess mother, such as pressed-flower greeting cards and brooms and brushes made from sisal hemp.\n\nIn 1985, the cabinet approved the proposal of the National Committee for the Promotion and Development of Social Welfare Activities that 21 October, the princess mother's birthday, be declared National Social Welfare Day. As she was also a nurse, it has since been renamed National Nurses' Day (Thai: วันพยาบาลแห่งชาติ Wan Phayaban Haeng Chat).\n\nFor the princess mother, education was of paramount importance. Being a scholarship student herself, she was known to have provided scholarships as far back as 1920, not long after her marriage to Prince Mahidol Adulyadej. The \"Bangkok Times\" of 21 September 1920 listed the names of donors to the Kullasatri Wang Lang School, which included the newly-weds, who had donated 5,000 baht. The publication noted that Mom Sangwan Mahidol na Ayudhya, having married into the royal family, was entitled to an annual stipend of 200 baht, and that she donated it entirely to needy students.\n\nThrough the influence of her husband, she had always considered it her responsibility to return to Thailand to help the nation. This sense of responsibility was instilled in her three children. According to Princess Galyani Vadhana, \"It was almost an unspoken rule, a nature [sic] sense of priority to do what we could for the country. What mother taught us came from Father. He was 8 years older than Mother, and taught her a lot. Mother was very receptive, she learned so much from Father. What she taught us I later found to be almost quoted verbatim from Father...It was like Father teaching us through Mother...\"\n\nOne of the princess mother's educational initiatives was the Border Patrol Police School project. A school had been set up by the Border Patrol Police Region 5 in their Dararasmi Camp, in Mae Rim District, Chiang Mai Province. The school provided access to education for children from remote regions, giving hill tribe children a chance to learn the Thai language and culture and instilling in them a sense of being Thai. The concept was in line with the princess mother's own philosophy that education was the key to improving human resources. She therefore took the school under her royal patronage in 1964, and donated funds to the Border Patrol Police to set up similar schools in remote areas. The private sector found this to be a worthy cause, and contributed its share in setting up more schools, which were named after their donors. Each school—there were eventually 185—had proper classrooms and accommodations for teachers. She went to open each of these schools, donating to them a set of symbolic items to bolster a sense of Thai identity, including a Buddha image to symbolize religion, a portrait of the king or queen as an emblem of the monarchy, and a flag to represent the nation. She also made sure that each school was equipped with a radio set to keep up with the news, and a map of Thailand to give students a sense of belonging no matter where in the country they were located.\n\nTo the Princess Mother, the health and well-being of her people were high on the list of priorities. The philosophy echoed that of her husband, Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, who had pledged his mental, physical, and financial support to the field of public health of the country.\n\nUpon the death of Prince Mahidol, the princess mother continued to provide scholarships to medical students so their studies would not be interrupted. When they returned to work, she also supplemented their salary if it happened to be lower than the set rate. A revolving fund of 500,000 baht was provided to Chulalongkorn University for 25 years, from which the interest could be used to send students for post-graduate studies overseas. After 25 years, the fund was transferred to the Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital.\n\nIn 1945, as she accompanied her elder son, King Ananda Mahidol, back to Thailand, she brought back with her the drug PAS which was used to treat tuberculosis.\n\nIn addition to providing scholarships, the princess mother continued to play a major role in the field of nursing in Thailand. She founded the Thailand Nursing Association, of which she was also a board member. With her funds, the first national nursing convention in Thailand was organized in 1960. Hospital buildings and nursing schools were built with her patronage.\n\nSince 1964, when trips to remote areas to visit villagers and army personnel became a routine procedure, she noticed how people there were plagued by health problems. Due to the lack of medical facilities, such basic illnesses as gastro-intestinal infections, tapeworms, skin diseases, and malaria would often lead to death.\n\nIn 1969, she established the first medical volunteer mobile unit in Chiang Mai Province, called \"The Princess Mother's Medical Volunteers\". The team was made up of doctors, dentists, pharmacists, nurses, and health officers, who volunteered their time on weekends to treat the ill, and offer consultative services to the public free of charge.\n\nAll expenses for these visits were subsidized by the princess mother. If she happened to be on the trip with the medical team, she would help fill the prescriptions and provide advice to the sick. Those in critical condition would be sent to local hospitals. Later, she experimented with the system of radio consultation between doctors in the hospital and patients at health centres in remote areas, following the system used by the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. The project was well received, and within a few years the number of radio centres increased to 446 covering 25 provinces, with the centre of operations at Srapathum Palace. Over a million patients benefited from this service.\n\nIn 1974, the princess mother donated one million baht to establish \"The Princess Mother’s Volunteer Flying Doctor Foundation\", which was subsequently changed into \"The Princess Mother's Volunteer Foundation\" (PMMV) in 1985.\n\nThe Prostheses Foundation and the Breast Foundation, both under the patronage of the princess mother, were two projects initiated in her later years. The Prostheses Foundation was set up in 1992, when she learned that a doctor from Chiang Mai University had developed below knee prostheses from recycled plastic bottles which cost only 700 baht, and artificial limbs that could be used for agricultural purposes for 300 baht. She saw this as an opportunity to provide artificial limbs free of charge to the poor. With initial funding donated by the princess mother, and further donations from her daughter, Princess Galyani Vadhana, and the general public, the foundation offers artificial limbs to the needy.\n\nIn 1964, at the age of 64, she hiked to the top of Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest peak, in Chiang Mai Province. She had been used to hiking from Bhubing Palace, accompanied by border control police and two physicians. Soon she felt that she had covered all she could within the immediate vicinity, and yearned to conquer Doi Inthanon, which was visible from the palace windows. In those days there was no access road to the top, so the princess mother spent two nights camping out during her hike, the first night at Pang Somdet, and the following night at Ban Pha Mon. A large number of hill tribe villagers turned up to welcome her. The tribes people's lack of access to medical care concerned her. When she returned the following year, she brought with her two physicians, and her visits to these remote areas by helicopter eventually earned her the name \"Mae Fah Luang\" among the hill tribes, meaning 'royal mother from the sky', referring to her arrival by helicopter with physicians, nurses, medicines, food, and clothing.\n\nWith her visits to the hill tribes, she realized that their slash-and-burn system of cultivation had inadvertently caused the destruction of the watershed forests. Over the years, they had moved from place to place, leaving behind them patches of barren hillside.\n\nIn response, she created the Doi Tung Development Project. \"I shall plant forests on Doi Tung\", she pledged. In 1988, a total of 93,515 rai (14,962 ha) in Mae Chan District, Mae Sai District, and Mae Fa Luang District of Chiang Rai Province were targeted for reforestation and sustainable development to improve the quality of life of the local villagers.\n\nThe princess mother played an active role in the Doi Tung Development Project, beginning with nursing tree saplings herself and replanting forests. Surrounding the palace are experimental plots where temperate crops are tested, such as Arabica coffee beans from Brazil and Costa Rica, macadamia, and chestnuts. Mulberry trees, the fibre of which is used to make \"sa\" paper, is another of the money-making crops they plant, nurture, and process. New plant cultivation technologies are continually tested for the cultivation of asparagus, bananas, orchids, and strawberries. After successful trials, villagers are trained in the techniques to follow, the improvements designed to provide them with increased income.\n\nA Drug Rehabilitation Centre was also set up so addicts could be treated and provided with vocational training to suit their way of life.\n\nWhile her children were growing up as members of the royal family in the days of absolute monarchy, it would have been so easy for the princess mother to bring them up in a life of privilege, surrounded by attentive staff eager to follow orders. But that was not the way of Prince Mahidol or his wife.\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana described her upbringing as being very much in the vein of any normal family, where the children are taught to be respectful of grown-ups, to be responsible in their duties, and to expect punishment when they are naughty. Corporal punishment was applicable as the last resort. First-time mistakes would be discussed, and explanations given; however, if the children still persisted despite reasons and warnings, then punishment would be meted out. Often the Princess Mother would even discuss with the offender what level of punishment they thought deserved. Then they would face the consequences.\n\nPrincess Galyani Vadhana recounted a particular episode in Lausanne when Prince Ananda Mahidol, despite frequent warnings persisted in picking on a youngster who was the son of the caretaker. On this particular occasion, Prince Ananda Mahidol pushed the boy near some stairs, which could have led to a disastrous outcome. The exasperated mother said to her son, \"I've warned you many times, this time I’m going to spank you. How many times do you think you should be spanked?\" Whereupon the young boy answered, \"Once\". \"I don't think that's enough,\" continued Mother, \"since you’ve done it several times now. I think it should be three times.\" And with that, the punishment was carried out. Prince Ananda never picked on the little boy again.\n\nThe children had been taught from a young age to be thrifty. They each received weekly pocket money, the amount depending on their age, but never more than was necessary to buy themselves some sweets or chocolates. Other items, such as books and toys, also had to come out of their own pocket money. The princess mother only indulged them on special occasions like birthdays.\n\nA sense of frugality was something that the princess mother practiced throughout her life. Even when she was in a position to pamper herself, she preferred to maintain her simple way of life. Her meals were simple dishes that emphasized nutritional value. She only had new clothes made when necessary, usually two outfits a year. She wore very little jewelry. A simple bracelet made of nine gemstones was the extent of her accessories; she said it went with any outfit. She also wore one particular ring—a diamond ring with her Thai initials \"Sor Vor\" (Thai: ส.ว.) etched on top. The initials stood for \"Savang Vadhana\" (Thai: สว่างวัฒนา), the given name of Queen Sri Savarindira, who had given her the ring.\n\nManners were an integral part of character building. The children were taught to respect elders and behave properly with other people, and this remained the same despite the change in their status later in life. Along with manners came spirituality and religion. Though she learned about Christianity during her years in the US, she remained a devout Buddhist, and brought her children up in the Buddhist faith. However, she was clever enough to introduce Western religious rites such as bedtime prayers into their daily routine to make Buddhism more accessible to them. Instead of the usual Sanskrit incantations, they said their prayers in Thai, asking the Lord Buddha to protect them and lead them down the good and righteous path. Prayers would then be supplemented by stories of the life of the Buddha.\n\nTo encourage them to be aware of their responsibilities, the children were expected to do their chores like any other children. They had to keep their rooms clean and even the young king had to make his own bed when he was in Lausanne. This habit remained in later years. When King Bhumibol Adulyadej was living overseas, he would drive, wash, and even polish his own car without assistance. Similarly, after his music sessions, he would insist on putting away his own musical instruments and wiping them himself.\n\nHer way of bringing up the children earned great respect from Queen Sri Savarindira, who had nothing but praise for her daughter-in-law. As Princess Galyani Vadhana noted, \"Queen Sri Savarindira did not get involved in the everyday routine of bringing up the children, but only gave advice on important matters. That was because she respected Mother, seeing that she brought up her children with proper discipline and in the right way. Queen Sri Savarindira did not feel the need to interfere because Mother was doing such a good job already.\"\n\nAccording to Princess Galyani Vadhana's book, \"Busy Fingers\", the princess mother had always shown an interest in astronomy. \"When she was in the States she had a copy of \"Astronomy for Beginners\". Later on when her youngest son started astronomy lessons at his Lausanne school, Mother bought him a copy of \"Le Ciel\" (The Sky), Larousse edition. In this book there were some maps of stars and the Moon which she looked up so often that three pages fell out. These Mother took out eventually for separate use.”\n\nOn boat trips, the princess mother was known to have enjoyed standing on deck at night, gazing at the stars without the use of a telescope. When naval officers explained the names of the constellations to her in Thai and English, she would give their French and Latin names, then proceed to astonish the officials with her knowledge of the constellations.\n\nHer interest in astronomy remained a lifelong passion and was reflected in several of her other activities. The constellations appeared as part of her ceramics painting, on lamps, ashtrays, and dishes, often in the form of flowers representing the stars, with the number of petals and the colours representing the magnitude of each star.\n\nHer love of astronomy was evident in her Doi Tung Royal Villa. The ceiling of the main reception hall is decorated with the constellations as designed by the Bangkok Planetarium. \"I want a ceiling for the hall that is inexpensive,\" she instructed, opting for a carving of the solar system and the 12 signs of the zodiac, and 12 constellations rather than a crystal chandelier. Each star was represented by a light bulb giving off a comparative magnitude of light. Wood carvings of other constellations also adorned her private balcony and some of doors.\n\nThe princess mother had a passion for flowers. It was a defining characteristic that dominated her life from her youth through to her later years. This love of flowers reflected a sensitivity and a concern for nature that was not just enjoyment of its aesthetic qualities, but included the need to care and nurture them into full bloom with the same kind of attention and concern that she gave to her role as mother, and every other project in her lifetime.\nPlants are like people. This particular zinnia I didn't grow from a seed, but bought a sapling from a nursery, and it is now strong and healthy. Why is that? Because the nursery owner knew how to choose a good seed, and the right soil. He knew how to nurse the sapling, which I couldn’t have done as he did. When I bought it back, I had to attend to it, fertilize it constantly because the soil here is not so fertile. I have to constantly water the plant, turn the soil, pull the weeds and pick the dead leaves. People are like that; if he comes from a good breed, the child will be healthy and intelligent. If the parents provide constant nurturing, picking out the defective bits and adding fertilizer, the child will grow up and prosper like these zinnias.\n\nAnother hobby since she was a nursing student at Siriraj Hospital was photography. When she arrived in California and started receiving her own pocket money of US$5 a month, she saved to buy her own box camera. She experimented with different photographic techniques, such as double exposure, and would continuously upgrade her equipment. Her children were subjects for her camera, and as a result, the country has extensive records of their two kings as children. In 1928, her interest was drawn to the movie camera. She was among the 50 members of the Amateur Cinematographic Society set up by King Prajadhipok at Chitralada Palace. The hobby was adopted by both her sons.\n\nThe princess mother was fond of outdoor activities. She was an avid skier. It was a sport she enjoyed with her children when they were in Switzerland. Badminton and horseback riding were also regular activities, and she continued riding well into her seventies. She only gave up badminton when she was 70, and skiing when she was 80. In later years, she would enjoy a game of pétanque.\n\nThrough her knowledge of health care and nutrition, and regular exercise, the princess mother retained good health. A physical examination in 1988 showed that she was in perfect condition. \"If you were to look at the medical report, her blood tests, blood pressure, pulse, etc., without knowing who the patient was, I guarantee that no one would have guessed her age correctly, as the results were no different from those of any strong and healthy young man or woman\", said Dr. Chek Dhanasiri, one of her physicians.\n\nWhen the Princess Mother started making regular visits to villagers, officials, soldiers and police in the Thai border areas in 1966, the scene from her helicopter showed barren hillsides devoid of trees, with occasional shifting crops, weeds, and opium poppies. From these visits, she learned of the precarious existence of the villagers who had to grow crops through slash-and-burn cultivation methods that destroyed the natural environment and the watershed.\n\n\"I shall plant forests on Doi Tung.\" With those words, a royal initiative was created, launching a project to return the mountain to its original state. The Princess Mother was also determined to improve the quality of life of the villagers, provide education and health services, means of a regular income, and an awareness of the need to preserve the environment.\n\nActing on this inspiration, the government under Prime Minister General Prem Tinsulanonda set up the Doi Tung Development Project in 1988 as a joint project between seven ministries. The princess mother was approaching her 90th birthday, and the Thai people were concerned that her annual sojourns in Switzerland were becoming too taxing for age. A house on Doi Tung would be the perfect solution. At 1,000 metres elevation, with temperatures ranging between 17 and 24 degrees Celsius, its climate and the surrounding scenery were not unlike the cool, mountain setting of Villa Vadhana in Lausanne.\n\nThe two-story house is nestled against a steep incline. The upper floor is divided into four sections: the private quarters of the Princess Mother, the private quarters of her daughter Princess Galyani Vadhana, the quarters of Princess Galyani Vadhana's only daughter, Thanpuying Dhasanawalaya Sornsongkram, and the reception hall and kitchen.\n\nReflecting the Princess Mother's deep interest in astronomy, the ceiling in the reception hall is carved in the image of the solar system, with clusters of the different star signs. It has a handcrafted wood inlay of the Princess Mother's favourite constellations. Designed by the Astronomy Society of Thailand, light bulbs installed in the ceiling representing stars showed the position of the constellations on 21 October 1900, the day the Princess Mother was born. Walls are lined with Thai silk embroidered with flowers. Other decorative items are carvings of elephant herds in the forest, while the Thai alphabet lines the stairway to the lower level.\n\nBehind the palace is a long balcony lined with flower boxes. It is here that the Princess Mother spent many hours tending to the flowers. The lower levels are living and working quarters. In front is a wide lawn with flower gardens, which affords a view of mountain ranges.\n\nThe Princess Mother took up residence at the Doi Tung Royal Villa on 23 November 1988, 10 months after the start of construction, and before it was completed. She stayed at the Royal Villa on five more occasions for several months at a time to allow her to work on her projects.\n\nParallel to the princess mother's project on the greening of Doi Tung was a plan to improve the quality of life of the local hill tribe villagers. No longer able to rely on their slash-and-burn method of cultivation, they needed alternative ways to feed themselves and earn income. In 1972, the princess mother established the Hill Tribes Products Promotion Foundation with an initial donation of 100,000 baht. The foundation, based at Srapathum Palace in Bangkok, would promote and market the handicrafts produced by each village. The foundation also provided training to hill tribe youth.\n\nThe princess mother donated money to buy 2.3 hectares of land in Chiang Rai, which became the centre for training in agriculture, weaving, and dyeing. A Hill Tribe Youth Leadership Programme was set up to allow 50 youths to undergo training each year.\n\nThe Princess Mother's official residence was Sa Pathum Palace, where she lived with her daughter, Princess Galyani Vadhana. In mid-1991, she fell in her bedroom, never entirely recovering from that accident. In November 1993, December 1994, and again in June 1995 she was admitted to the Siriraj Hospital for treatment. Princess Srinagarindra died at 21:17 ICT on 18 July 1995 at Siriraj Hospital at the age of 94. She was one of the longest-living Thai royals.\n\nAs her body lay in state within the ancient and cavernous Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall, in the compound of the Grand Palace, mourners thronged to pay their last respects. These included not only members of the royal family, diplomats, government officials, and those living within the confines of the capital city, but also hill tribe villagers from the far corners of the kingdom.\n\nThe royal cremation took place on 10 March 1996, for which an elaborately carved royal crematorium, or \"Phra Merumas\", was built in the centre of Sanam Luang, symbolizing the mythical mountain abode of the Hindu gods.

The earliest human civilizations began near the shores of rivers, and consequently coincided with the dawn of hydrology, hydraulics, and hydraulic engineering.\n\nThe fundamental principles of hydrostatics and dynamics were given by Archimedes in his work \"On Floating Bodies\" (), around 250 BC. In it, Archimedes develops the law of buoyancy, also known as Archimedes' Principle. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Archimedes maintained that each particle of a fluid mass, when in equilibrium, is equally pressed in every direction; and he inquired into the conditions according to which a solid body floating in a fluid should assume and preserve a position of equilibrium.\n\nIn the Greek school at Alexandria, which flourished under the auspices of the Ptolemies, attempts were made at the construction of hydraulic machinery, and about 120 BC the fountain of compression, the siphon, and the forcing-pump were invented by Ctesibius and Hero. The siphon is a simple instrument; but the forcing-pump is a complicated invention, which could scarcely have been expected in the infancy of hydraulics. It was probably suggested to Ctesibius by the Egyptian wheel or Noria, which was common at that time, and which was a kind of chain pump, consisting of a number of earthen pots carried round by a wheel. In some of these machines the pots have a valve in the bottom which enables them to descend without much resistance, and diminishes greatly the load upon the wheel; and, if we suppose that this valve was introduced so early as the time of Ctesibius, it is not difficult to perceive how such a machine might have led to the invention of the forcing-pump.\n\nNotwithstanding these inventions of the Alexandrian school, its attention does not seem to have been directed to the motion of fluids; and the first attempt to investigate this subject was made by Sextus Julius Frontinus, inspector of the public fountains at Rome in the reigns of Nerva and Trajan. In his work \"De aquaeductibus urbis Romae commentarius\", he considers the methods which were at that time employed for ascertaining the quantity of water discharged from ajutages (tubes), and the mode of distributing the waters of an aqueduct or a fountain. He remarked that the flow of water from an orifice depends not only on the magnitude of the orifice itself, but also on the height of the water in the reservoir; and that a pipe employed to carry off a portion of water from an aqueduct should, as circumstances required, have a position more or less inclined to the original direction of the current. But as he was unacquainted with the law of the velocities of running water as depending upon the depth of the orifice, the want of precision which appears in his results is not surprising.\n\nIslamicate scientists, particularly Abu Rayhan Biruni (973–1048) and later Al-Khazini (fl. 1115–1130), were the first to apply experimental scientific methods to fluid mechanics, especially in the field of fluid statics, such as for determining specific weights. They applied the mathematical theories of ratios and infinitesimal techniques, and introduced algebraic and fine calculation techniques into the field of fluid statics.\n\nIn fluid statics, Biruni discovered that there is a correlation between the specific gravity of an object and the volume of water it displaces. He also introduced the method of checking tests during experiments and measured the weights of various liquids. He also recorded the differences in weight between freshwater and saline water, and between hot water and cold water. During his experiments on fluid mechanics, Biruni invented the conical measure, in order to find the ratio between the weight of a substance in air and the weight of water displaced.\n\nAl-Khazini, in \"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom\" (1121), invented a hydrostatic balance.\n\nIn the 9th century, Banū Mūsā brothers' \"Book of Ingenious Devices\" described a number of early automatic controls in fluid mechanics. Two-step level controls for fluids, an early form of discontinuous variable structure controls, was developed by the Banu Musa brothers. They also described an early feedback controller for fluids. According to Donald Routledge Hill, the Banu Musa brothers were \"masters in the exploitation of small variations\" in hydrostatic pressures and in using conical valves as \"in-line\" components in flow systems, \"the first known use of conical valves as automatic controllers.\" They also described the use of other valves, including a plug valve, float valve and tap. The Banu Musa also developed an early fail-safe system where \"one can withdraw small quantities of liquid repeatedly, but if one withdraws a large quantity, no further extractions are possible.\" The double-concentric siphon and the funnel with bent end for pouring in different liquids, neither of which appear in any earlier Greek works, were also original inventions by the Banu Musa brothers. Some of the other mechanisms they described include a float chamber and an early differential pressure.\n\nIn 1206, Al-Jazari's \"Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices\" described many hydraulic machines. Of particular importance were his water-raising pumps. The first known use of a crankshaft in a chain pump was in one of al-Jazari's saqiya machines. The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first implied in one of al-Jazari's saqiya chain pumps, which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump. Al-Jazari also invented a twin-cylinder reciprocating piston suction pump, which included the first suction pipes, suction pumping, double-action pumping, and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism. This pump is remarkable for three reasons: the first known use of a true suction pipe (which sucks fluids into a partial vacuum) in a pump, the first application of the double-acting principle, and the conversion of rotary to reciprocating motion, via the crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism.\n\nBenedetto Castelli, and Evangelista Torricelli, two of the disciples of Galileo, applied the discoveries of their master to the science of hydrodynamics. In 1628 Castelli published a small work, \"Della misura dell' acque correnti\", in which he satisfactorily explained several phenomena in the motion of fluids in rivers and canals; but he committed a great paralogism in supposing the velocity of the water proportional to the depth of the orifice below the surface of the vessel. Torricelli, observing that in a jet where the water rushed through a small ajutage it rose to nearly the same height with the reservoir from which it was supplied, imagined that it ought to move with the same velocity as if it had fallen through that height by the force of gravity, and hence he deduced the proposition that the velocities of liquids are as the square root of the head, apart from the resistance of the air and the friction of the orifice. This theorem was published in 1643, at the end of his treatise \"De motu gravium projectorum\", and it was confirmed by the experiments of Raffaello Magiotti on the quantities of water discharged from different ajutages under different pressures (1648).\n\nIn the hands of Blaise Pascal hydrostatics assumed the dignity of a science, and in a treatise on the equilibrium of liquids (\"Sur l’équilibre des liqueurs\"), found among his manuscripts after his death and published in 1663, the laws of the equilibrium of liquids were demonstrated in the most simple manner, and amply confirmed by experiments.\n\nThe theorem of Torricelli was employed by many succeeding writers, but particularly by Edme Mariotte (1620–1684), whose \"Traité du mouvement des eaux\", published after his death in the year 1686, is founded on a great variety of well-conducted experiments on the motion of fluids, performed at Versailles and Chantilly. In the discussion of some points he committed considerable mistakes. Others he treated very superficially, and in none of his experiments apparently did he attend to the diminution of efflux arising from the contraction of the liquid vein, when the orifice is merely a perforation in a thin plate; but he appears to have been the first who attempted to ascribe the discrepancy between theory and experiment to the retardation of the water's velocity through friction. His contemporary Domenico Guglielmini (1655–1710), who was inspector of the rivers and canals at Bologna, had ascribed this diminution of velocity in rivers to transverse motions arising from inequalities in their bottom. But as Mariotte observed similar obstructions even in glass pipes where no transverse currents could exist, the cause assigned by Guglielmini seemed destitute of foundation. The French philosopher, therefore, regarded these obstructions as the effects of friction. He supposed that the filaments of water which graze along the sides of the pipe lose a portion of their velocity; that the contiguous filaments, having on this account a greater velocity, rub upon the former, and suffer a diminution of their celerity; and that the other filaments are affected with similar retardations proportional to their distance from the axis of the pipe. In this way the medium velocity of the current may be diminished, and consequently the quantity of water discharged in a given time must, from the effects of friction, be considerably less than that which is computed from theory.\n\nThe effects of friction and viscosity in diminishing the velocity of running water were noticed in the \"Principia\" of Sir Isaac Newton, who threw much light upon several branches of hydromechanics. At a time when the Cartesian system of vortices universally prevailed, he found it necessary to investigate that hypothesis, and in the course of his investigations he showed that the velocity of any stratum of the vortex is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the strata which enclose it; and from this it evidently follows that the velocity of a filament of water moving in a pipe is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the filaments which surround it. Taking advantage of these results, Italian-born French engineer Henri Pitot afterwards showed that the retardations arising from friction are inversely as the diameters of the pipes in which the fluid moves.\n\nThe attention of Newton was also directed to the discharge of water from orifices in the bottom of vessels. He supposed a cylindrical vessel full of water to be perforated in its bottom with a small hole by which the water escaped, and the vessel to be supplied with water in such a manner that it always remained full at the same height. He then supposed this cylindrical column of water to be divided into two parts – the first, which he called the \"cataract,\" being an hyperboloid generated by the revolution of an hyperbola of the fifth degree around the axis of the cylinder which should pass through the orifice, and the second the remainder of the water in the cylindrical vessel. He considered the horizontal strata of this hyperboloid as always in motion, while the remainder of the water was in a state of rest, and imagined that there was a kind of cataract in the middle of the fluid.\n\nWhen the results of this theory were compared with the quantity of water actually discharged, Newton concluded that the velocity with which the water issued from the orifice was equal to that which a falling body would receive by descending through half the height of water in the reservoir. This conclusion, however, is absolutely irreconcilable with the known fact that jets of water rise nearly to the same height as their reservoirs, and Newton seems to have been aware of this objection. Accordingly, in the second edition of his \"Principia\", which appeared in 1713, he reconsidered his theory. He had discovered a contraction in the vein of fluid (\"vena contracta\") which issued from the orifice, and found that, at the distance of about a diameter of the aperture, the section of the vein was contracted in the subduplicate ratio of two to one. He regarded, therefore, the section of the contracted vein as the true orifice from which the discharge of water ought to be deduced, and the velocity of the effluent water as due to the whole height of water in the reservoir; and by this means his theory became more conformable to the results of experience, though still open to serious objections.\n\nNewton was also the first to investigate the difficult subject of the motion of waves.\n\nIn 1738 Daniel Bernoulli published his \"Hydrodynamica seu de viribus et motibus fluidorum commentarii\". His theory of the motion of fluids, the germ of which was first published in his memoir entitled \"Theoria nova de motu aquarum per canales quocunque fluentes\", communicated to the Academy of St Petersburg as early as 1726, was founded on two suppositions, which appeared to him conformable to experience. He supposed that the surface of the fluid, contained in a vessel which is emptying itself by an orifice, remains always horizontal; and, if the fluid mass is conceived to be divided into an infinite number of horizontal strata of the same bulk, that these strata remain contiguous to each other, and that all their points descend vertically, with velocities inversely proportional to their breadth, or to the horizontal sections of the reservoir. In order to determine the motion of each stratum, he employed the principle of the \"conservatio virium vivarum\", and obtained very elegant solutions. But in the absence of a general demonstration of that principle, his results did not command the .confidence which they would otherwise have deserved, and it became desirable to have a theory more certain, and depending solely on the fundamental laws of mechanics. Colin Maclaurin and John Bernoulli, who were of this opinion, resolved the problem by more direct methods, the one in his \"Fluxions\", published in 1742, and the other in his \"Hydraulica nunc primum detecta\", \"et demonstrata directe ex fundamentis pure mechanicis\", which forms the fourth volume of his works. The method employed by Maclaurin has been thought not sufficiently rigorous; and that of John Bernoulli is, in the opinion of Lagrange, defective in clearness and precision.\n\nThe theory of Daniel Bernoulli was opposed also by Jean le Rond d'Alembert. When generalizing the theory of pendulums of Jacob Bernoulli he discovered a principle of dynamics so simple and general that it reduced the laws of the motions of bodies to that of their equilibrium. He applied this principle to the motion of fluids, and gave a specimen of its application at the end of his \"Dynamics\" in 1743. It was more fully developed in his \"Traité des fluides\", published in 1744, in which he gave simple and elegant solutions of problems relating to the equilibrium and motion of fluids. He made use of the same suppositions as Daniel Bernoulli, though his calculus was established in a very different manner. He considered, at every instant, the actual motion of a stratum as composed of a motion which it had in the preceding instant and of a motion which it had lost; and the laws of equilibrium between the motions lost furnished him with equations representing the motion of the fluid. It remained a desideratum to express by equations the motion of a particle of the fluid in any assigned direction. These equations were found by d'Alembert from two principles – that a rectangular canal, taken in a mass of fluid in equilibrium, is itself in equilibrium, and that a portion of the fluid, in passing from one place to another, preserves the same volume when the fluid is incompressible, or dilates itself according to a given law when the fluid is elastic. His ingenious method, published in 1752, in his \"Essai sur la résistance des fluides\", was brought to perfection in his \"Opuscules mathématiques\", and was adopted by Leonhard Euler.\n\nThe resolution of the questions concerning the motion of fluids was effected by means of Leonhard Euler's partial differential coefficients. This calculus was first applied to the motion of water by d'Alembert, and enabled both him and Euler to represent the theory of fluids in formulae restricted by no particular hypothesis.\n\nOne of the most successful labourers in the science of hydrodynamics at this period was Pierre Louis Georges Dubuat (1734–1809). Following in the steps of the Abbé Charles Bossut (\"Nouvelles Experiences sur la résistance des fluides\", 1777), he published, in 1786, a revised edition of his \"Principes d'hydraulique\", which contains a satisfactory theory of the motion of fluids, founded solely upon experiments. Dubuat considered that if water were a perfect fluid, and the channels in which it flowed infinitely smooth, its motion would be continually accelerated, like that of bodies descending in an inclined plane. But as the motion of rivers is not continually accelerated, and soon arrives at a state of uniformity, it is evident that the viscosity of the water, and the friction of the channel in which it descends, must equal the accelerating force. Dubuat, therefore, assumed it as a proposition of fundamental importance that, when water flows in any channel or bed, the accelerating force which obliges it to move is equal to the sum of all the resistances which it meets with, whether they arise from its own viscosity or from the friction of its bed. This principle was employed by him in the first edition of his work, which appeared in 1779. The theory contained in that edition was founded on the experiments of others, but he soon saw that a theory so new, and leading to results so different from the ordinary theory, should be founded on new experiments more direct than the former, and he was employed in the performance of these from 1780 to 1783. The experiments of Bossut were made only on pipes of a moderate declivity, but Dubuat used declivities of every kind, and made his experiments upon channels of various sizes.\n\nIn 1858 Hermann von Helmholtz published his seminal paper \"Über Integrale der hydrodynamischen Gleichungen, welche den Wirbelbewegungen entsprechen,\" in \"Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik\", vol. 55, pp. 25–55. So important was the paper that a few years later P. G. Tait published an English translation, \"On integrals of the hydrodynamical equations which express vortex motion\", in \"Philosophical Magazine\", vol. 33, pp. 485–512 (1867). In his paper Helmholtz established his three \"laws of vortex motion\" in much the same way one finds them in any advanced textbook of fluid mechanics today. This work established the significance of vorticity to fluid mechanics and science in general.\n\nFor the next century or so \"vortex dynamics\" matured as a subfield of fluid mechanics, always commanding at least a major chapter in treatises on the subject. Thus, H. Lamb's well known \"Hydrodynamics\" (6th ed., 1932) devotes a full chapter to vorticity and vortex dynamics as does G. K. Batchelor's \"Introduction to Fluid Dynamics\" (1967). In due course entire treatises were devoted to vortex motion. H. Poincaré's \"Théorie des Tourbillons\" (1893), H. Villat's \"Leçons sur la Théorie des Tourbillons\" (1930), C. Truesdell's \"The Kinematics of Vorticity\" (1954), and P. G. Saffman's \"Vortex Dynamics\" (1992) may be mentioned. Early on individual sessions at scientific conferences were devoted to vortices, vortex motion, vortex dynamics and vortex flows. Later, entire meetings were devoted to the subject.\n\nThe range of applicability of Helmholtz's work grew to encompass atmospheric and oceanographic flows, to all branches of engineering and applied science and, ultimately, to superfluids (today including Bose–Einstein condensates). In modern fluid mechanics the role of vortex dynamics in explaining flow phenomena is firmly established. Well known vortices have acquired names and are regularly depicted in the popular media: hurricanes, tornadoes, waterspouts, aircraft trailing vortices (e.g., wingtip vortices), drainhole vortices (including the bathtub vortex), smoke rings, underwater bubble air rings, cavitation vortices behind ship propellers, and so on. In the technical literature a number of vortices that arise under special conditions also have names: the Kármán vortex street wake behind a bluff body, Taylor vortices between rotating cylinders, Görtler vortices in flow along a curved wall, etc.\n\nThe theory of running water was greatly advanced by the researches of Gaspard Riche de Prony (1755–1839). From a collection of the best experiments by previous workers he selected eighty-two (fifty-one on the velocity of water in conduit pipes, and thirty-one on its velocity in open canals); and, discussing these on physical and mechanical principles, he succeeded in drawing up general formulae, which afforded a simple expression for the velocity of running water.\n\nJ. A. Eytelwein of Berlin, who published in 1801 a valuable compendium of hydraulics entitled \"Handbuch der Mechanik und der Hydraulik\", investigated the subject of the discharge of water by compound pipes, the motions of jets and their impulses against plane and oblique surfaces; and he showed theoretically that a water-wheel will have its maximum effect when its circumference moves with half the velocity of the stream.\n\nJNP Hachette in 1816–1817 published memoirs containing the results of experiments on the spouting of fluids and the discharge of vessels. His object was to measure the contracted part of a fluid vein, to examine the phenomena attendant on additional tubes, and to investigate the form of the fluid vein and the results obtained when different forms of orifices are employed. Extensive experiments on the discharge of water from orifices (\"Expériences hydrauliques\", Paris, 1832) were conducted under the direction of the French government by J. V. Poncelet (1788–1867) and J. A. Lesbros (1790–1860).\n\nP. P. Boileau (1811–1891) discussed their results and added experiments of his own (\"Traité de la mesure des eaux courantes\", Paris, 1854). K. R. Bornemann re-examined all these results with great care, and gave formulae expressing the variation of the coefficients of discharge in different conditions (\"Civil Ingénieur,\" 1880). Julius Weisbach (1806–1871) also made many experimental investigations on the discharge of fluids.\n\nThe experiments of J. B. Francis (\"Lowell Hydraulic Experiments\", Boston, Mass., 1855) led him to propose variations in the accepted formulae for the discharge over weirs, and a generation later a very complete investigation of this subject was carried out by Henri-Émile Bazin. An elaborate inquiry on the flow of water in pipes and channels was conducted by Henry G. P. Darcy (1803–1858) and continued by Bazin, at the expense of the French government (\"Recherches hydrauliques\", Paris, 1866).\n\nGerman engineers have also devoted special attention to the measurement of the flow in rivers; the \"Beiträge zur Hydrographie des Königreiches Böhmen\" (Prague, 1872–1875) of Andreas Rudolf Harlacher contained valuable measurements of this kind, together with a comparison of the experimental results with the formulae of flow that had been proposed up to the date of its publication, and important data were yielded by the gaugings of the Mississippi made for the United States government by Andrew Atkinson Humphreys and Henry Larcom Abbot, by Robert Gordon's gaugings of the Irrawaddy River, and by Allen J. C. Cunningham's experiments on the Ganges canal. The friction of water, investigated for slow speeds by Coulomb, was measured for higher speeds by William Froude (1810–1879), whose work is of great value in the theory of ship resistance (\"Brit. Assoc. Report.\", 1869), and stream line motion was studied by Professor Osborne Reynolds and by Professor Henry S. Hele-Shaw.\n\nVortex dynamics is a vibrant subfield of fluid dynamics, commanding attention at major scientific conferences and precipitating workshops and symposia that focus fully on the subject.\n\nA curious diversion in the history of vortex dynamics was the vortex atom theory of William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin. His basic idea was that atoms were to be represented as vortex motions in the ether. This theory predated the quantum theory by several decades and because of the scientific standing of its originator received considerable attention. Many profound insights into vortex dynamics were generated during the pursuit of this theory. Other interesting corollaries were the first counting of simple knots by P. G. Tait, today considered a pioneering effort in graph theory, topology and knot theory. Ultimately, Kelvin's vortex atom was seen to be wrong-headed but the many results in vortex dynamics that it precipitated have stood the test of time. Kelvin himself originated the notion of circulation and proved that in an inviscid fluid circulation around a material contour would be conserved. This result singled out by Einstein in \"Zum hundertjährigen Gedenktag von Lord Kelvins Geburt, Naturwissenschaften, 12 (1924), 601–602,\" (title translation: \"On the 100th Anniversary of Lord Kelvin's Birth\"), as one of the most significant results of Kelvin's work provided an early link between fluid dynamics and topology.\n\nThe history of vortex dynamics seems particularly rich in discoveries and re-discoveries of important results, because results obtained were entirely forgotten after their discovery and then were re-discovered decades later. Thus, the integrability of the problem of three point vortices on the plane was solved in the 1877 thesis of a young Swiss applied mathematician named Walter Gröbli. In spite of having been written in Göttingen in the general circle of scientists surrounding Helmholtz and Kirchhoff, and in spite of having been mentioned in Kirchhoff's well known lectures on theoretical physics and in other major texts such as Lamb's \"Hydrodynamics\", this solution was largely forgotten. A 1949 paper by the noted applied mathematician J. L. Synge created a brief revival, but Synge's paper was in turn forgotten. A quarter century later a 1975 paper by E. A. Novikov and a 1979 paper by H. Aref on chaotic advection finally brought this important earlier work to light. The subsequent elucidation of chaos in the four-vortex problem, and in the advection of a passive particle by three vortices, made Gröbli's work part of \"modern science\".\n\nAnother example of this kind is the so-called \"localized induction approximation\" (LIA) for three-dimensional vortex filament motion, which gained favor in the mid-1960s through the work of Arms, Hama, Betchov and others, but turns out to date from the early years of the 20th century in the work of Da Rios, a gifted student of the noted Italian mathematician T. Levi-Civita. Da Rios published his results in several forms but they were never assimilated into the fluid mechanics literature of his time. In 1972 H. Hasimoto used Da Rios' \"intrinsic equations\" (later re-discovered independently by R. Betchov) to show how the motion of a vortex filament under LIA could be related to the non-linear Schrödinger equation. This immediately made the problem part of \"modern science\" since it was then realized that vortex filaments can support solitary twist waves of large amplitude.\n\n"}

In 2005 the festival was also held in Vienna. Many of the events are broadcast via the internet. International literary figures to have appeared at the festival include John Banville, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Salman Rushdie, Irvine Welsh, William Styron and Nadine Gordimer.\n\nThe festival's origins are in London in the late 1970s, when PWF president Michael March began organising poetry readings at Keats House. As permitted by the Helsinki Accords, writers from the Eastern Bloc were invited to participate. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the readings relocated to Prague, due to its reputation as \"a natural host and meeting place for writers\". Writers from various countries were invited to Prague as a crossroads between East and West to present their work and their culture to an international audience in the form of discussions and readings. The first Prague Writers’ Festival took place at Wallenstein Palace in May 1991 and was themed \"Wedding Preparations in the Country\". Over the next twenty years, Prague Writers' Festival became an increasingly important event in Prague's cultural life.\n\n\nThe main focus of the festival is the public readings. Every evening during the event, authors take the stage for an \"audience with\" event, and read excerpts from their work, each writer reading in their native language while Czech and English translations are provided simultaneously. Authors also appear in other supporting events such as book signings, concerts or film projections. Each day a new conversation, dedicated to a literary or political subject, is held. The hour-long discussions are followed by questions from the audience.\n\nThe main media partner of the PWF is the British daily newspaper \"The Guardian\", which often refers to festival events, issues and news on its cultural pages. Many of the events are streamed live on the internet and the festival's website also hosts an archive of previous events. The festival's archives are available to the public online, in a database of Czech and English texts. One of the aims of the PWF Foundation is to secure funding for full digitisation of its archives.\n\nAs a cultural foundation, Prague Writers’ Festival is engaged year-round in other cultural activities. The PWF Foundation publishes books and helps to organize concerts (such as Ed Sanders and the Plastic People of the Universe) and movie screenings, as well as art exhibitions (such as \"Dada East?\" and \"The World in 1968\").\n\nThe Prague Writers’ Festival offers discount tickets and other benefits to high school classes, and also works in partnership with principals and teachers at local schools to organise the annual Walter Serner Short Story Prize. By virtue of its focus on humanities, languages and literature, the festival also has a long-standing partnership with several Czech universities and with the University of New York in Prague. It also co-operates with students from Charles University, Masaryk University and the Prague College of Journalism to arrange activities for the festival.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She studied for a year at L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne where she was trained to drape fabric and study the classical techniques of couture. Miller described her Parisian training as \"intense,\" but explained that it gave her training in fabric manipulation, which became a signature of her designs.\n\nMiller's first shop opened in 1986 on Madison Avenue. The brand has grown to 20 boutiques in major cities across the United States.\nand is sold in a number of high-end department stores. Miller designs an extensive collection for J.C. Penney and a home furnishing collection for Bed, Bath and Beyond.\n\nOf her style, the designer has said: \"I've always been downtown and uptown. I've had a lot of artist friends and I was always a little bit of a renegade.\" Her modern design aesthetic is known for its bright prints and patterns.\n\nMiller was born in Fort Worth, Texas. Her father and Parisian-born mother, met in World War II. Her father was an engineer at General Electric. Her father was great influence on young Miller; she attributes her ability to make clothing to her father's engineer-like mind. Miller said: \"The way you figure out how to make something is engineering.\"\n\nHer mother, on the other hand, \"hated\" living in America and insisted on dressing her daughters in a French-influenced style. When Miller was asked by the Mattel toy company to design a Barbie doll, she claimed to have never owned a Barbie herself because her mother insisted that she and her sister play with French dolls. Since December 2009, Miller's Barbie has been featured in an ongoing exhibit, Barbie: The Fashion Experience, at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis.\n\nAfter completing studies at the L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne and graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design, Miller interned with legendary dress designer Clovis Ruffin in New York City. Miller began working as head designer at P.J. Walsh, a dress manufacturer. There, she was hired by the president of the company, Bud Konheim. Konheim said one of the reasons he hired Miller was for her belief that design and business can be successful combination. In 1982, Konheim started the company Nicole Miller with Nicole.\n\nHer signature style has historically been black or boldly colored—with the cut of the clothes most important. Her main concern has always been proportions, curves and necklines. Her designs are known to be sexy, yet classic. She is a self-identified fabric junkie credited with popularizing many futuristic fabrics. Her styles range from body-conscious cocktail dresses, to wedding attire, to lounge wear, but she is best known for her form-flattering dresses and garish men's neckties.\n\nMiller draws inspiration from a wide range of influences including mid-20th century cinema, contemporary art, mid-20th century architecture, and exotic cultures.\n\nIn 1986, Miller opened her first shop on Madison Avenue.
