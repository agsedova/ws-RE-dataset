{"id": "1873024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873024", "title": "Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms", "text": "Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms\n\nBetween 1873 and 1882, the life and work of Charles Darwin from \"Insectivorous Plants\" to \"Worms\" continued with investigations into carnivorous and climbing plants that had begun with his previous work. Worries about family illnesses contributed to his interest in Galton's ideas of \"hereditary improvement\" (which would later be called Eugenics). He continued to help with the work of Downe parish church and associated village amenities, despite problems with control being seized by a new High Church vicar, and he remained on good terms with the Church's patron, the Revd. John Brodie Innes. There was continuing interest in Charles Darwin's views on religion, but he remained reticent.\n\nDespite repeated problems and delays caused by Charles Darwin's illness, his work on evolution-related experiments and investigations continued, with the production of books on the movement of climbing plants, insectivorous plants, the effects of cross and self fertilisation of plants, different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and \"The Power of Movement in Plants\". His ideas on evolution were increasingly accepted in scientific circles despite some bitter disputes, and he received numerous honours. As well as writing out his own autobiography for his family, he wrote an introduction to a biography of his grandfather Erasmus Darwin. In his last book, he returned to the effect earthworms have on soil formation.\n\nHe died in Downe, Kent, England, on 19 April 1882. He had expected to be buried in St Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be given a major ceremonial funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton.\n\nIn the aftermath of the publication of \"On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection\" in 1859, Charles Darwin's allies Charles Lyell, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Thomas Huxley, Alfred Russel Wallace and Asa Gray in America worked to spread acceptance of its ideas despite difficulty in coming to terms with natural selection and man's descent from animals.\n\nDarwin's research and experiments on plants and animals continued, and his extensive writings countered the arguments against evolution, particularly those put by the Duke of Argyll and St George Mivart.\n\nDarwin's sons George and Horace were ill and arrived home at Christmas 1872 for nursing. Darwin turned from his insectivorous plants to a more leisurely update of his monograph on climbing plants.\n\nHe was intrigued by Galton's latest \"hereditary improvement\" ideas (which would be called Eugenics after 1883), proposing that society should breed out mental and physical disability and improve the nation's stock by introducing \"a sentiment of caste among those who are naturally gifted\". Families would be registered and incentives offered so that the best children chosen from each \"superior family\" would marry and reproduce. Darwin, aware that of his brood only William had good health, had already dismissed the aims as too \"utopian\" in \"the Descent of Man\". He thought these new proposals impractical if voluntary and politically horrifying if enforced by compulsory registration, even were they the \"sole feasible\" way of \"improving the human race\". He felt it better simply to publicise the \"all-important principle of inheritance\" and let people pursue the \"grand\" objective for themselves. In any case it was too late for his own infirm offspring.\n\nHuxley was also ill, needing a rest and harried by a neighbour suing over a damp basement. The X Club (a dining club formed in November 1864 to support the evolutionary \"new reformation\" in naturalism, including Huxley, Hooker, John Tyndall, Busk, Spencer, and Spottiswoode) raised a £2,000 collection for him, primed by Darwin with £300. Darwin's spirits were again downcast when Lyell's wife died.\n\nIn June 1873 Darwin resumed work on his insectivorous plants, with some distractions as his wife Emma took care of the seven Huxley children while Huxley and Hooker went on holiday to the continent. Having young children in the house was like the 1850s again.\n\nA new reforming High Church vicar, the Revd. George Sketchley Ffinden, had been imposing his ideas since taking over the parish in November 1871. Darwin had to write to the patron, John Brodie Innes, explaining what had upset the parishioners. Ffinden now usurped control of the village school which had been run for years by a committee of Darwin, Lubbock and the incumbent priest, with a \"conscience clause\" which protected the children from Anglican indoctrination. Ffinden began lessons on the \"Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican faith\", an unwelcome move from the point of view of the Baptists in the village. Darwin withdrew from the committee and cut his annual donation to the church, but continued with the Friendly Society work.\n\nHensleigh Wedgwood's daughter Effie had married Thomas \"Theta\" Farrer in May, and on 5 August 1873 the Darwins went to visit them for a few days. They arrived to hear that a fortnight previously the Farrer's servants had been called to an accident. Earl Granville's riding companion Samuel Wilberforce had been killed in a fall from his horse, and was subsequently laid out in state for two days in the Farrer's drawing room. Although an opponent of the \"Origin\", Wilberforce had always thought Darwin a \"capital fellow\".\n\nAt home, a heated discussion with Hooker ended with Darwin lying in bed with his memory gone and \"a severe shock continually passing through my brain\". Emma feared an epileptic fit, but the doctor put him on a diet and in September he returned to work on insectivorous plants. His correspondence continued, funding worthy projects and acknowledging countless gifts including \"Das Kapital\" from \"a sincere admirer\", Karl Marx, which Darwin had difficulty in following, but hoped that both their efforts towards \"the extension of knowledge... [would] add to the happiness of mankind\".\n\nFrank struggled with his medical studies, and after finishing his thesis on animal tissues he was to assist with plant tissues at Downe. George's legal career had been ended by stomach illness and he had spent two years going to spas. He began writing topical essays, the first in the \"Contemporary Review\" on Galton. His latest essay boldly dismissed prayer, divine morals and \"future rewards & punishments\". Darwin urged him not to publish it for some months, and \"to pause, pause, pause.\"\n\nDuring a visit in November 1873 the Harvard philosopher John Fiske amused the X Club with his story of a cockney in New York warning him \"What, that 'orrid hold hinfidel 'Uxley? Why, we don't think hanythink of 'im in Hingland! We think 'e's 'orrid!\", himself writing that \"I am quite wild over Huxley... what a pleasure to meet such a clean-cut mind! It is like Saladin's sword which cut through the cushion.\" and \"Old Darwin is the dearest, sweetest, loveliest old grandpa that ever was. And on the whole he impresses me with his strength more than any man I have seen yet. There is a charming kind of quiet strength about him and about everything he does. He isn't burning and eager like Huxley. He has a mild blue eye, and is the gentlest of gentle old fellows. [His] long white hair and enormous white beard [made him] very picturesque... guileless simplicity... I am afraid I shall never see him again, for his health is very bad. Of all my days in England I prize today the most.\"\n\nDarwin tackled a new edition of the \"Descent of Man\", and offered the self-financing Wallace the work of assisting him. Wallace quoted seven shillings an hour, mentioning that he was \"dipping into politics\" proposing nationalisation of coal mining. Emma found out and had the task given to their son George, so Darwin had to write apologetically to Wallace, adding \"I hope to Heaven that politics will not replace natural science.\"\n\nFor two years, Emma had organised a winter reading room in the local school for local labourers, who subscribed a penny a week to smoke and play games, with \"Respectable newspapers & a few books... & a respectable housekeeper..there every evening to maintain decorum.\" This was a common facility to save men from \"resorting to the public house\". In 1873 the Revd. Ffinden opposed it, as \"Coffee drinking, bagatelle & other games\" had been allowed and \"the effects of tobacco smoke & spitting\" were seen when the children returned in the morning. Emma got Darwin to get the approval of the education inspectorate in London, and just before Christmas 1873 the Darwins and Lubbocks got the agreement of the school committee, offering to pay for any repairs needed \"to afford every possible opportunity to the working class for self improvement & amusement\". A furious Ffinden huffed that it was \"quite out of order\" for the Darwins to have gone to the inspectorate behind his back. In the autumn of 1874 Darwin let off steam at Ffinden and formally resigned from the school committee on health grounds.\n\nFrancis Galton was attracted to the recent spiritualism movement. On a visit to London in January 1874 Darwin attended a séance at Erasmus's house with relatives including Hensleigh Wedgwood, as well as Huxley. George had hired the medium Charles Williams, and they sat round the table in the dark, but as the room grew stuffy Darwin went upstairs to lie down, missing the show, with sparks, sounds and the table rising above their heads. While Galton thought it a \"good séance\", Darwin later wrote \"The Lord have mercy on us all, if we have to believe such rubbish\" and told Emma that it was \"all imposture\" and \"it would take an enormous weight of evidence\" to convince him otherwise. At a second séance Huxley and George found that Williams was nothing but a cheat, to Darwin's relief. Emma told Hensleigh's daughter Snow that Charles \"won't believe it, he dislikes the thought of it so much\". Snow remembered that her uncle \"used to look upon it as a great weakness if one allowed wish to influence belief\" and when Emma said that \"he does not always act up to his principles\" Snow thought that was \"what one means by bigotry\", to which Emma said \"Oh yes, he is a regular bigot\".\n\nDarwin continued painfully rewriting his books with the help of Henrietta and George, incorporating ideas from Galton and new anecdotes. He bought from Lubbock the Sandwalk he had been renting for years, but the price seemed excessive and affected their friendship. News of a dispute involving the removal of George Bentham from presidency of the Linnean Society, allegedly spurred on by Owen, led Darwin to write \"What a demon on earth Owen is. I do hate him\". With Huxley's assistance he updated the \"Descent\" on ape-brain inheritance, which Huxley thought \"pounds the enemy into a jelly... though none but anatomists\" would know it.\n\nThe manuscript was completed in April 1874, and the publisher John Murray planned a 12 shilling half-price edition to replicate the success of the cheap revision of the \"Origin\". Darwin left the proofs to George, and turned again to Plants. The new edition was published on 13 November with the price cut to the bone at 9 shillings.\n\nDuring 1874 Darwin contacted many of his old friends to assist with experimentation on insectivorous or carnivorous plants. Helpers included Hooker and his assistant William Thiselton-Dyer at Kew, John Burdon-Sanderson at University College London running lab tests on the plant's digestion, and Asa Gray at Harvard. Enquiries to \"Nature\" magazine brought in sacks of mail to be dealt with by Frank, who settled into Brodie Innes's old house in the village and married Amy Ruck on 23 July. At this time the family was joined by George Romanes who had been a student with Frank at Cambridge. Plants experimented on were members of the genera \"Drosera\" and \"Pinguicula\", including \"D. rotundifolia\" and \"P. vulgaris\".\n\nAs well as working on the proofs, George Darwin made a statistical analysis of first cousin marriages (three times more frequent in \"our rank\" than in the lower) and, influenced by Galton, published an article on \"beneficial restrictions in marriage\". Mivart attacked this anonymously in the \"Quarterly Review\", misinterpreting advocacy of divorce in cases of criminality or advice as \" the most oppressive laws, and the encouragement of vice in order to check population\", talking of \"hideous sexual criminality\". A furious Darwin told George to take legal advice while he contacted the publisher of his books and the \"Quarterly\", John Murray, threatening to \"take his business elsewhere\".\n\nDarwin's holiday at Southampton with William was overshadowed as he drafted George's response. John Tyndall's address to the British Association later that month laid claim to \"wrest from theology the entire domain of cosmological theory\" and led to calls for his prosecution for blasphemy. Lyell, now nearly blind and in deteriorating health, wrote to Darwin applauding the boost to \"you and your theory of evolution\" despite his qualms about the hereafter. Darwin was sympathetic, but did \"not feel any innate conviction\" of life after death. The October issue of the \"Quarterly\" carried George's response and an \"apology\" from Mivart which still maintained \"that the doctrines... are most dangerous and pernicious\" and infuriated Darwin.\n\nOn 13 November Hooker's wife Fanny died suddenly, and a devastated Hooker felt unable to return home after the funeral and brought his family to Downe. Emma looked after the children, and when Hooker returned to Kew, Darwin urged \"hard work\" to overcome his \"utter desolation\". Later, Darwin mentioned the Mivart argument and Hooker rallied the X Club (a dining club formed in November 1864 to support the evolutionary \"new reformation\" in naturalism, including Huxley, Hooker, John Tyndall, Busk, Spencer, and Spottiswoode). Huxley eagerly used a review to attack \"anonymous slander\", telling Darwin that he \"ought to be like one of the blessed gods of Elysium, and let the inferior deities do battle with the infernal powers.\" Mivart confidentially pleaded to make amends, but Huxley told Darwin that the \"most effectual punishment\" was to \"give him the cold shoulder\". Darwin was itching to speak his mind, and when no apology had come by 12 January 1875 he wrote vowing never to communicate with Mivart again.\n\nDarwin struggled on, by February 1875 telling George that \"I know full well the feeling of life being objectless & all being vanity of vanities\", and Hooker that he was even \"ready to commit suicide\". The death of Lyell on 22 February had him feeling \"as if we were all soon to go\". Their friendship had cooled after Lyell declined to back natural selection, and Darwin pleaded illness rather than take part as a pall-bearer at the funeral in Westminster Abbey. In March Darwin took the proofs of \"Insectivorous Plants\" to Murray.\n\nFor a year the vicar had refused to speak to any of the Darwins, and when two evening lectures were proposed for the village, Lubbock had to act as an intermediary in requesting use of the schoolroom. The committee agreed, but Ffinden refused to co-operate, writing that \"I had long been aware of the harmful tendencies to revealed religion of Mr. Darwin's views, but.. I had fully determined.. not to let my difference of opinion interfere with a friendly feeling as neighbours, trusting that God's grace might in time bring one so highly gifted intellectually and morally to a better mind.\" Darwin was equally haughty in return, condescending that \"If Mr. F bows to Mrs D. and myself, we will return it\". He found that dealing with Mivart and Ffinden was increasing his private hostility to Christianity.\n\nDarwin's daughter Henrietta at first supported a petition drawn up by Frances Power Cobbe demanding anti-vivisection legislation. Though Darwin was an animal lover and had never carried out vivisection, he persuaded her that \"Physiology can only progress by experiments on living animals\". During his spring break in London he took the matter up with his contacts, at first thinking of a counter-petition, then on Huxley's advice seeking support lobbying for a pre-emptive bill to provide for regulated vivisection with what he called a \"more humanitarian aspect\". The hint to the fox-hunting houses of parliament that a ban could lead to further restrictions helped, and though Cobbe's bill reached the House of Lords on 4 May 1875 a week before the scientist's bill reached the House of Commons, the Home Secretary announced a Royal Commission of inquiry to resolve the arguments, with Huxley co-opted on to the Commission.\n\nThe demand for Darwin as an author was shown when \"Insectivorous Plants\", a 450-page catalogue of plant experiments, sold out quickly and in July a 1,000 copy reprint sold out within a fortnight.\n\nNow Darwin turned to work on a new edition of \"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication\" incorporating additions from the hundreds of letters and scores of monographs that had been sent to Darwin in the seven years since it had been published. Parts were altered or discarded, and George Romanes set aside work on jellyfish to graft vegetable plants in experiments aimed at finding out about the \"gemmules\" which Darwin thought formed the mechanism of inheritance of characteristics. Investigations into \"pangenesis\" by Galton had tried blood transfusions between different breeds of rabbits without success. Darwin continued to look for proof of inheritance of acquired characteristics, amassing evidence of blacksmith's children being muscular and babies born with scars matching those of their parents. He would not follow Huxley in discarding these ideas, and \"Descent\" had presented such inheritance as a significant factor in human evolution.\n\nDarwin had long been concerned that his children could have inherited his weaknesses. He was proud that Frank seemed to have inherited his interest in natural history, coming to Down House from the village to carry out plant experiments, and put his son up for a Fellowship of the Linnean Society.\n\nWith \"Variation\" at the printers and with his old essay on \"The Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants\" due out in November 1875 with \"illustrations... drawn by my son, George\", Darwin wrote \"The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom\". This drew on a painstaking series of experiments, protecting the plants from insects and controlling the pollination of flowers, counting the seeds and checking them for fertility, repeated for up to ten generations with detailed records kept at every stage.\n\nDarwin tabulated the results, Galton checked his statistics, and they found the crossed plants significantly superior to self-fertilised ones in height, weight, vigour and fertility. The same principle would apply to people, and though the attempt to get a question on the census had failed, George analysed data from lunatic asylums and the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" which Darwin cited as showing a small effect produced by first-cousin marriages.\n\nWhile Emma ensured that he took short breaks, Darwin pressed on with work as \"my sole pleasure in life\" and finished the first draft of \"Fertilisation\" in May 1876, promptly going on to a revision of \"Orchids\".\n\nThey visited Hensleigh and Fanny to celebrate the announcement that Frank's wife Amy was five months pregnant, and Charles and Emma would shortly become grandparents. Darwin decided to leave a posthumous memoir for his family, and on Sunday 28 May 1876 he began \"Recollections of the Development of my mind and character\". He found this candid private memoir easy going, covering his childhood, university, life on the Beagle and developing work in science. A section headed \"Religious Belief\" opened just before his marriage, and frankly discussed his long disagreement with Emma. (\"see Charles Darwin's views on religion\") He recalled Annie and thought of how, but for her untimely death, she would now \"have grown into a delightful woman... Tears still come into my eyes, when I think of her sweet ways\". He completed his memoir on 3 August, concluding that after his book on fertilisation was published, \"my strength... will probably be exhausted\".\n\nOn 7 September the baby, named Bernard, was born at Down House, but his mother suffered a fever and convulsions, and died four days later at the age of 26. Darwin thought it the \"most dreadful thing\", and Frank in a state of shock and grief moved into Down House with the baby. The contractors were brought in to extend the house for him, and Frank carried on with mechanical chores for his father, making a fair copy of the memoir and correcting proofs of \"Orchids\".\n\nDespite Ffinden's continuing opposition, Emma's project of a parish reading room for labourers was restarted and opened before Christmas. Darwin saw \"Orchids\" and \"Cross and Self Fertilisation\" published as he wrote his next book on flowers. In February 1877 he attended the \"George and Dragon\" in his position as treasurer and persuaded the village labourers, who were suffering from wage cuts and a threat to their jobs in a farm slump, not to disband the \"Friendly Society\" and take the proceeds, but to keep some protection for their longer term security by keeping the books open while distributing their surplus funds. His old Whig principles fitted well with the \"Self-Help\" philosophy of another Murray author, Samuel Smiles, who had impressed Darwin.\n\nAs a \"thorough Liberal\", Darwin supported Gladstone, the \"Grand Old Man\" of British politics. Three months earlier Darwin had backed the outcry against the \"Bulgarian horrors\" when 15,000 (Christian) Bulgarian rebels were massacred by Muslim \"Turkish\" troops of the Ottoman Empire, and supported Gladstone's calls for Russian intervention in opposition to the Tory government's support for the Turks. Marx thought this a hypocritical preference for a Christian oppressor, and complained about Darwin's support for the \"piggish demonstration\". On 10 March Gladstone, while doing the rounds of his backbenchers and visiting Lubbock, turned up with his entourage at Down House and for two hours regaled a silent Darwin with comments from his latest pamphlet on \"Turkish terrorism\", and \"launched forth his thunderbolts with unexhausted zest\". Before leaving he asked Darwin if evolution meant that the future belonged to America as the Eastern civilisations decayed; after thinking it over, Darwin responded \"Yes.\" Watching Gladstone's \"erect alert figure\" walking away, he said \"What an honour that such a great man should come to visit me!\"\n\nA fortnight after Gladstone's visit, the leading secularist, militant atheist and unofficial Liberal candidate Charles Bradlaugh with co-publisher Annie Besant caused public outrage by publishing do-it-yourself contraceptive advice from an American doctor, Charles Knowlton, in a sixpenny pamphlet \"Fruits of Philosophy\". Bradlaugh and Besant were accused of obscenity and committed for trial on 18 June 1877. A fortnight beforehand they subpoenaed Darwin for their defence, expecting his support. Appalled, he wrote protesting the \"great suffering\" this would put him to, and advised that he would have to denounce the defendants as he had \"long held an opposite opinion\" on birth control, as evidenced by an extract from the \"Descent of Man\" stating that \"our natural rate of increase, though leading to many and obvious evils, must not be greatly diminished by any means.\" The practice of contraception would \"spread to unmarried women & would destroy chastity on which the family bond depends; & the weakening of this bond would be the greatest of all evils to mankind.\"\n\nThe subpoena was dropped, and Darwin was not held back from holidaying at Leith Hill and Southampton for his much needed \"rest\" which, as usual, meant working furiously away from home. He visited Stonehenge for the first time, examining how worm castings had buried the megaliths over time. Emma feared that the day-trip involving two hours train journey and a 24-mile drive would \"half kill\" him, but he was in wonderful form even after digging in the hot sun.\n\nIn mid July 1877 his work on the sex life of plants culminated in the publication of \"The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species\", dedicated to Asa Gray. He could not \"endure being idle\" and turned to his next book, on plant movement. Emma got him away for his autumn break to Abinger on the North Downs, and though Wallace now lived only a few miles away, Darwin avoided him, diplomatically writing that he \"wished to come over to see you, but driving tires me so much that my courage failed.\"\n\nThe University of Cambridge had come round to Darwinism, and on Saturday 17 November the family attended the Senate House for a ceremony in which Darwin was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws in front of crowds of students, who strung a cord across the chamber with a monkey-marionette which was removed by a Proctor then replaced by a \"missing link\", a beribboned ring which hung over the crowd through the ceremony.\n\nDarwin entered to a roar of approval. The Public Orator gave his panegyric describing Darwin's work with purple Latin prose, to some good humoured heckling from the students, and distanced the dignitaries from \"the unlovely tribe of apes\" saying \"'Mores in utroques dispares' – the moral nature of the two races is different\".\n\nEmma had a headache, so she and Darwin let their boys to stand in for them at a dinner in his honour at which Huxley chided the university for failing to honour Darwin twenty years earlier. On the Sunday, after a \"brilliant luncheon\" with George at Trinity College, they were given guided tours. The engineering professor James Stuart showed Emma and Darwin round his workshop and later wrote of \"A strong.. looking man with iron grey hair..[as though] rough hewn from a rock with a heavy..hammer... A man of genius.. indeed one of 'the few'.\"\n\nInto the spring of 1878 Darwin and Frank again filled the house with experiments on the movement of plants. To Frank it was \"as if an outside force were compelling him\", and in March the strain brought back his old sickness of attacks of dizziness. Dr. Clark in London prescribed a \"dry diet\" which helped, and refused to charge his patient so Darwin sent £100 towards the development of a fungus-proof potato by a \"highly respectable\" Belfast breeder. He also responded to an appeal asking 's officers for help in supporting an orphan – the grandson of Jemmy Button.\n\nGeorge Romanes had become Darwin's leading protégé, but a conflict between his reasoned scepticism and earlier longing for faith came to a head when his sister died. His attempt to get solace from a leading spiritualist came to nothing. Darwin invited Romanes to Downe to help him recover. Romanes had earlier written a refutation of theism, and had taken Darwin's advice to pause, but now wanted to publish. Darwin counselled anonymity, and suggested study of the evolution of religious reasoning, giving him unused notes on instinct from his work on \"Natural Selection\". Romanes launched on the study of comparative psychology, and in August was given a standing ovation for his talk at the British Association. In November the Darwins were staying with the Litchfields, and Romanes drove there to introduce his fiancé and present his new book, \"A Candid Examination of Theism\" by \"Physicus\". Darwin read it with \"very great interest\", but was unconvinced.\n\nThe German scientific periodical \"Kosmos\" featured, as a 70th birthday tribute to Charles Darwin, an essay by Ernst Krause on his grandfather Erasmus Darwin. In March 1879 he arranged for it to be translated as a book to which he would add a biographical preface. This would counter Samuel Butler's \"Evolution Old and New\" in which the previously supportive, though unscientific, author of \"Erewhon\" had turned against Darwinism, and he sent a copy of it to Krause.\nIn the summer he became bogged down with the proofs of his preface about Erasmus, and Henrietta edited out controversial points. The publisher John Murray was satisfied, but Darwin vowed \"never again\" to be \"tempted out of my proper work\".\n\nThe origin and swift diversification of flowering plants in the Early Cretaceous appeared to go against Darwin's view of gradual evolution, and in a July 1879 letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker he called this an \"abominable mystery\". He sought explanations such as a long earlier development having taken place in an area where the fossil record had been lost, possibly a sunken continent, or relatively rapid development having been spurred by coevolution between insects and plants.\n\nAlthough he tired more quickly now, Darwin still worked for several hours a day. Emma ensured he took holidays, in autumn 1879 joining the Litchfields for a month in the Lake District where he met with John Ruskin, though this was not a meeting of minds. On return the Darwins were visited by Ernst Haeckel whose \"roaring\" about the freedom of science had Darwin retreating to his plants.\n\nDarwin unsuccessfully tried to get government support for the Belfast potato breeder from the Permanent Secretary, Thomas \"Theta\" Farrer (Effie Wedgwood's husband). Farrer was more concerned that his daughter by his first marriage wanted to marry the unsuitable sickly Horace Darwin. Despite her father's opposition the young couple prevailed, with Darwin giving his son £5,000 of railway stock and assuring Farrer that Horace would have a suitable inheritance. The wedding took place on 3 January 1880, with the families not on speaking terms.\n\nIn \"Evolution Old and New\" Samuel Butler claimed that earlier evolutionists had correctly seen the mind as controlling evolution, and Mivart told Richard Owen that he thought the book would \"help to burst the bubble of 'Natural Selection'.\" Ernst Krause's \"Erasmus Darwin\" countered this, and Butler took affront at Darwin's preface which said that Krause's essay predated Butler's book, when it clearly had passages written later. Darwin had to admit that Krause had revised his essay, and spent a week in February 1880 drafting responses, then was persuaded to ignore the dispute, writing to Huxley \"I feel like a man condemned to be hung who has just got a reprieve\". Butler took the silence as a tacit admission of guilt.\n\nHuxley titled his Royal Institution talk \"The Coming of Age of the Origin of Species\", celebrating its 21st anniversary, though wrongly claiming that before its publication only catastrophism was accepted. While Darwin (on holiday with the Farrers, now on good terms) was delighted by the press coverage, he was disappointed to find no mention in its text of natural selection – even \"Darwin's Bulldog\" was still not committed to the central plank of his theory.\n\nIn April, Gladstone defeated the Tories at the general election, delighting Charles and Emma Darwin though not all their relatives, and a buoyant Charles sent a large subscription to Abbot's \"The Index\" with hearty wishes for success in the \"good cause of truth\" and 'free religion'. The Liberal success even got the militant atheist Charles Bradlaugh elected as MP for Northampton, and public controversy about atheism erupted. He was prevented from taking his seat in the House of Commons by procedural requirements of the oath of allegiance, and secularists such as Edward Aveling toured the country leading protests. Aveling had been writing a series on \"Darwin and his Works\" in Bradlaugh's paper \"The National Reformer\", and Darwin had sent written thanks which he now feared would be published to his shame.\n\nIn June, after sending \"Movement in Plants\" to his publisher John Murray, Darwin visited William and Sarah at Southampton, and he got William to write to Abbot withdrawing the endorsement that had been printed as advertising copy in the magazine: even association with free thought in distant America could damage his respectability.\n\nDarwin again took up his work on worms. As ever, he corresponded widely, encouraging and helping fund research and collecting anecdotes. Emma supported his commitment, saying that \"if it was a condition of his living, that he sh[oul]d do now work, she was willing for him to die\". For their autumn break they visited Horace and Ida in Cambridge, and to spare him the stress of getting between London stations and changing trains Emma arranged a private railway carriage. At Cambridge he showed Emma around the \"scenes of my early life\".\n\nIn September 1880 he completed the proofs of \"Movement in Plants\", his largest botany book at 600 pages with 196 wood-cuts, sighing \"I am turned into a sort of machine for observing facts & grinding out conclusions.\" When on 13 October he got the request he had feared from Aveling, for permission to dedicate the \"Darwin and his Works\" articles to Darwin in book format, he declined in a four-page letter marked PRIVATE emphasising that he confined his writing to science and avoided aiding attacks on religion.\n\nAttacks on Darwin's theory continued, and when the official report of a scientific voyage slighted \"the theory which refers the evolution of species to extreme variation guided only by natural selection\" he responded in \"Nature\", \"Can Sir Wyville Thomson name any one who has said that the evolution of species depends only on natural selection?\" and set out multiple causes, including \"use and disuse of parts\". He called Thomson's criticism appropriate to \"theologians and metaphysicians\", and was only stopped by Huxley from using \"irreverent language\".\n\nWallace was suffering \"ever-increasing anxiety\" over funds, and Arabella Buckley, Lyell's old secretary, pleaded with Darwin to help him find \"some modest work\". Hooker persuaded Darwin it was hopeless, noting that Wallace had \"lost caste\" over spiritualism and a £500 bet he had won by proving the world was a globe to a rich flat-earth fanatic who then started litigation which cost Wallace more than the bet had won. When Wallace's \"best book\" to date, \"Island Life\", came out in November 1880 Darwin devoted all his attention to getting his friends to sign a testimonial he wrote, then rushed it to Gladstone before the re-opening of Parliament at the start of January and was overjoyed when Gladstone agreed to recommend a civil list pension of £200 a year, backdated six months. As Darwin passed on the good news to Wallace, Emma organised the family accounts so that Charles could distribute the surplus from the year's £8,000 investment income to the children.\n\nDowne was snowed in, and an outbreak of swine fever involved Darwin as magistrate signing orders daily to allow movement of stock. He wrote to Kovalevsky \"I make sure, but wo[e]fully slow progress, with my new book\" on worms. In late February he visited London, and called on Duke of Argyll, his old opponent. They had a long and \"awfully friendly\" discussion, and when Argyll asked if it was not \"impossible to look at [the design of orchids] without seeing that they were the effect and the expression of Mind?\", Darwin looked at him \"very hard\" before replying that he could see the \"overwhelming force\" this argument might have, but he could no longer accept it.\n\nThe billiard room at Down House was now devoted to worm experiments which included Darwin shining different colours of lights at them at night, his sons playing different musical instruments to them, different scents and kinds of food. Other stimuli were ignored, but a bright white light or a touch of breath would make them bolt \"like rabbits\" into their burrows. They appeared to \"enjoy the pleasure of eating\" showing \"eagerness for certain kinds of food\", sexual passion was \"strong enough to overcome... their dread of light\", and he saw \"a trace of social feeling\" in their way of \"crawling over each other's bodies\". Experiments showed that they dragged leaves into their burrows narrow end first, having somehow got a \"notion, however rude, of the shape of an object\", maybe by \"touching it in many places\" with a sense like \"a man... born blind and deaf\" and a rudimentary intelligence.\n\nBy mid march he was writing the final chapters of what he told Victor Carus would be \"a small book of little moment. I have little strength & feel very old.\" He wrote to \"The Times\" about the anti-vivisection cause, accusing it of committing \"a crime against humanity\" by holding back the \"progress of physiology\", then commented that we \"ought to be grateful\" to worms, which reached a depth of \"five or six feet\" even \"here at Down\" where he expected to be buried shortly.\n\nBefore Easter he sent off his manuscript for \"The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms\", and found he had no \"heart or strength... to begin any investigation lasting for years\". \"Never happy except when at work\", he was at a loose end until he remembered his autobiography. On 22 April 1881, exactly 30 years after Annie's burial, he re-read the passages about her and Emma's letter of that time, and added a note under his daguerreotype of Annie, \"When I am dead, know that many times, I have kissed & cryed over this.\" [sic.]\n\nHe left the proofs of \"Worms\" to Frank and, despondent, turned down Gladstone's invitation to become a Trustee of the British Museum. Early in June 1881 Emma and the Litchfields took him to the Lake District, together with William and young Bernard. The sky was \"like lead\" and an attempt at climbing brought spots before his eyes and a doctor's diagnosis that his heart condition was \"precarious\". He wrote to Hooker that \"Illness is downright misery to me... I cannot forget my discomfort for an hour [and] must look forward to Down graveyard as the sweetest place on earth.\"\n\nThen he was perked up by the 400-page \"The Creed of Science\" by the Irish philosopher William Graham arguing the validity of traditional beliefs in the face of materialism. Darwin wrote to Graham expressing doubts about the conclusions – \"The chief one is that the existence of so-called natural laws implies purpose. I cannot see this.\" He was swayed by one – \"You have expressed my inward conviction.. that the Universe is not the result of chance\", but then qualified this by his \"horrid doubt\" that such beliefs might have arisen as the human mind evolved, and were no more to be trusted than \"the convictions of a monkey's mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind\". He still supported natural selection as the engine of social progress, pointing out that \"The more civilised so-called Caucasian races have beaten the Turkish hollow in the struggle for existence\" and telling Graham that elimination of \"lower races\" by \"higher civilised races\" was inevitable in the progress of Malthusian struggle.\n\nBack at Downe, a letter from Wallace promoted the socialist ideas of Henry George's \"Progress and Poverty\" proposing to \"make land common property\" as morally just. The landowner Darwin responded that such books had \"a disastrous effect\" on his mind, he hoped that Wallace would not \"turn renegade to natural history\" while adding that \"I have everything to make me happy and contented\".\n\nTo Hooker he wrote of \"Pleasant memories of long past days... many a discussion and... a good fight\". Hooker valued their arguments \"as iron sharpeneth iron\" and, longing to \"throw off the trammels of official life\" and retire from Kew, found it \"difficult to resist the pessimist view of creation\", but \"when I look back... to the days I have spent in intercourse with you and yours, that view takes wings to itself and flies away.\" That summer Darwin was in his \"happiest spirits\", chatting \"deliciously\" for hours and in the evenings asking for Bach and Handel to be played repeatedly. Romanes, visiting with his wife and baby, thought the old man as \"grand and good and bright as ever\".\n\nDarwin stayed with Erasmus while his portrait was painted by John Collier and on 3 August dined by special invitation with the Prince of Wales, the Crown Prince of Germany and eminent physicians at the start of the Seventh International Medical Congress. Later, Erasmus became gravely ill and died on 26 August, and at the funeral at Downe on 1 September Charles, looking \"old and ill\", was a picture of \"sad reverie\". Subsequently, Darwin inherited half Erasmus's estate. William announced that this made Darwin's wealth over a quarter of a million pounds, \"\"without\" mother's fortune\", and Darwin redrafted his will. He sent a note to his sister Caroline about her half of Erasmus's estate, enclosing a miniature of their mother and commenting that he could not remember her face, though he did recall her \"black velvet gown\" and the \"death scene\".\n\nA requested visit from the eminent but atheist German Doctor Ludwig Büchner in company with the notorious Edward Aveling went amiably on Thursday 28 September with Darwin introducing his old friend the Revd. Brodie Innes, and defending agnosticism \"(see Charles Darwin's views on religion)\".\n\n\"Worms\" was published in October 1881 and within weeks thousands had been sold. It brought a flood of letters, with many \"idiotic\" enquiries, and a \"worn out\" Darwin escaped with Emma to visit Horace and Ida in Cambridge.\n\nDarwin, \"quite set up\", returned to his experiments on plant roots standing in an ammonia solution, preparing sections and looking for \"physiological division of labour\" through his microscope.\n\nIn London he made an unannounced visit to the house of Romanes on 15 December. Romanes was absent, and Darwin declined the concerned butler's invitation to come in. He crossed the street, stumbled and clutched the railings before getting a cab. The next morning Dr. Clark pronounced him fine, but Emma kept him indoors and he was visited by eminent scientists. He seemed bright and animated, but told the geologist John Judd that he had \"received his warning\".\n\nOnce home, this did not hold him back from working hard at his root cells, as well as still doing his walks round the Sandwalk, receiving visitors and dealing with letters. In one he argued with an American feminist that women are \"inferior intellectually\". In February he was \"miserable to a strange degree\" with a cough. On 7 March 1882 he had a seizure while on the Sandwalk 400 yards from the house and struggled back to collapse in Emma's arms. Dr. Clark diagnosed angina and prescribed morphine pills for the pain. Darwin lay prostrate in despair, then a younger doctor, Dr. Norman Moore, assured him that his heart was only weak and within days Darwin was back at work, writing to \"Nature\" about beetles.\n\nHaving company helped. Henrietta brought her friend Laura Forster (aunt of E. M. Forster), herself making a rapid recovery from illness. Darwin daily told Laura of his symptoms and feelings. One day he came out into the garden and, putting his arms round Emma, said \"Oh Laura, what a miserable man I should be without this dear woman.\" Another afternoon he joined her in the drawing-room and said \"The clocks go dreadfully slowly, I have come in here to see if this one gets over the hours any quicker than the study one does.\"\n\nEmma wanted a quiet Easter, so Laura and Henrietta left on 4 April, but on the 4th and 5th Darwin suffered attacks, noting \"much pain\". He recorded his own symptoms, and continued to note sporadic attacks. He took capsules of amyl nitrite, an antispasmodic, and was attended by Dr. Moore and a local physician, Dr. Allfrey.\n\nOn the 10th, George arrived back from the West Indies, and though Darwin was not up to talking for very long, he enjoyed George's news. Emma remembered how Darwin was \"gracious & tender\" when being attended for his illness, and would say \"It is almost worth while to be so to be nursed by you\".\n\nGeorge helped Frank and Jackson (the butler) to carry Darwin to and from his bed. On the nights of 11 and 12 April, Darwin had excruciating attacks of pain. On Saturday 15 April they were visited by the Lichfield family. Darwin joined them for dinner but had a giddy attack and fell down, and had to retire early. He did better on the Sunday, and on Monday was well enough to walk, supported on both sides, as far as the orchard.\n\nDarwin seemed \"fully up to the average, so on Tuesday 18 April the Lichfields left and George went to Cambridge. Darwin stayed up late later than usual in the evening, chatting to Bessy. Just before midnight he again had agonising pain, and woke a flustered Emma to ask for the amyl nitrite. She had difficulties finding it at first, and with the assistance of Bessy gave him brandy.\n\nEmma later noted that he had woken her saying \"I have got the pain & I shall feel better or bear it better if you are awake\". He had taken the antispasmodic twice, and afterwards said \"I am not the least afraid of death- Remember what a good wife you have been to me – Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me\".\n\nDr Allfrey attended and gave some relief, then after he left at 8 a.m. Charles began violent vomiting, after two hours gasping \"If I could but die\" repeatedly. Frank and Henrietta returned to join Bessy, who persuaded a worn out Emma to take an opium pill and rest. Charles woke in a daze, recognised his children and embraced them with tears. Emma's notes state that after the worse of the distress he said \"I was so sorry for you – but I could not help you... there never were such good nurses as you [Francis] & Henrietta – Where is Mammy\", and when told she was lying down, \"I am glad of it... Don't call her I don't want her\", and often \"It's almost worth while to be sick to be nursed by you\".\n\nHe suffered more bouts of nausea and pain, then at 3.25 p.m. groaned \"I feel as if I should faint\". Emma was called and held him as he suffered excruciating pain, then lost consciousness and died at 4 p.m. on Wednesday 19 April 1882. Dr Allfrey signed the death certificate which gave \"Angina pectoris Syncope\" as the cause of death.\n\nFrank brought Bernard from the nursery to the garden. As they walked past the drawing-room window Bernard noticed his aunts and said \"Why are Bessy and Etty crying? because Grandpa is so ill?\" Grief-stricken, Frank eventually said \"Grandpa has been so ill that he won't be ill any more.\" They reached the Sandwalk and Bernard gathered a bouquet of wild lilies.\n\nArrangements were made for burial in St. Mary's churchyard at Downe, with Brodie Innes offering to perform the rites, and the customary black edged letters were sent out to friends, relatives and colleagues.\n\nIn London Galton got William Spottiswoode as President of the Royal Society to telegraph the Darwins asking if they would consent to burial in Westminster Abbey, an honour that Darwin had been glad to see given to Lyle in 1875. They told Hooker, Lubbock and Huxley who with Spottiswoode met the Revd. Frederic Farrar, Canon of Westminster. Farrar suggested a petition to overcome any objections to an agnostic being buried in the Abbey, and approached the Revd. George Granville Bradley, Dean of Westminster. Lubbock took up a petition in the House of Commons stating that \"it would be acceptable to a very large number of our countrymen of all classes and opinions that our illustrious countryman Mr. Darwin should be buried in Westminster Abbey.\" It was \"very influentially signed\". Newspapers took the request up, sending a public plea to Emma and the children to consent, as foreign tributes poured in. \"The Standard\" maintained that \"true Christians can accept the main scientific facts of Evolution just as they do of Astronomy and Geology\", \"The Times\" declared the 1860 debate was \"ancient history\" and the \"Daily News\" said that Darwin's doctrine was consistent \"with strong religious faith and hope\".\n\nHurried arrangements were made, and Emma saw it \"nearly settled. It gave us all a pang not to have him rest quietly by Eras – ; but William felt strongly, and on reflection I did also, that his gracious & grateful nature would have wished to accept the acknowledgement of what he had done\". While her children and relatives attended the funeral, she stayed at Downe.\n\nThe Downe tradesmen were disappointed, the publican pointing out that it \"would have helped the place so much, for it would have brought hosts of people down to see his grave\". The joiner had \"made his coffin just the way he wanted it, all rough, just as it left the bench, no polish, no nothin\", but this was returned and replaced by one \"you could see to shave in\". He added that \"They buried him in Westminster Abbey, but he always wanted to lie here, and I don't think he'd have liked it.\"\n\nThat Sunday, Church sermons praised Darwin, saying Natural Selection was \"by no means alien to the Christian tradition\" (if interpreted correctly) and seeking a \"reconciliation between Faith and Science\". On Tuesday there was a massive demand for admission cards to the funeral.\n\nAll day on Tuesday the hearse was drawn by four horses the 16 miles from Downe to Westminster in cold drizzling rain. Next morning the Abbey filled with mourners including international dignitaries and scientists. At mid day on Wednesday 26 April 1882 the full pomp of a state occasion began.\n\nThe service included a specially commissioned anthem setting words from the Book of Proverbs to music composed for the occasion by Frederick Bridge, \"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and getteth understanding\". As the Darwin family later recalled, William \"was sitting in the front seat as eldest son and chief mourner, and he felt a draught on his already bald head; so he put his black gloves to balance on the top of his skull, and sat like that all through the service with the eyes of the nation upon him.\" Darwin was buried beneath the monument to Isaac Newton, next to Sir John Herschel, and as the coffin was lowered, the choir sang an anthem from Ecclesiasticus to music by Handel, \"His body is buried in peace, but his name liveth evermore\".\n\nPallbearers at the funeral included: William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire; George John Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll; Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby; James Russell Lowell; William Spottiswoode; Joseph Dalton Hooker; Alfred Russel Wallace; Thomas Henry Huxley; John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury; and last but by no means least Rev. Frederic Farrar; Stanley and Farrar were both Cambridge Apostles as Erasmus Alvey 'Ras' Darwin had been; Charles Darwin himself had not been a member of the Cambridge Apostles.\n\nThe service was conducted by Canon George Prothero (1818-1894) and the other Westminster Abbey staff present were minor canon Rev. John Henry Cheadle (? - ?); minor canon Rev. John Troutbeck (1832-1899); Canon Thomas James Rowsell (1816-1894); Canon Alfred Barry (1826-1910); Canon Robinson Duckworth (1834-1911); Rev. Samuel Flood Jones, precentor, (1826-1895); the Chapter Clerk, Mr. Charles St. Clare Bedford (1810-1900); Frederick Bridge, organist 1844-1924 (according to The Times, he composed an anthem for the funeral). The Dean, George Granville Bradley, was not in the country at the time of the funeral hence Canon Prothero was in charge.\n\nGalton proposed a commemorative stained glass window in the Abbey, with panels symbolising the works of nature, each contributed by a different country. The evolution pane did not proceed, but the Royal Society formed a committee which decided on a bronze plaque in the Abbey, and a statue for the new Natural History Museum at South Kensington. Richard Owen remained opposed, and unveiling of the statue had to wait till 1885, after his retirement. The pomp and ceremony was attended by the Prince of Wales, scientists and the family, though not Emma, and led by Huxley.\n\nDarwin's Westminster Abbey funeral expressed a public feeling of national pride, with the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" proclaiming that Great Britain had \"lost a man whose name is a glory to his country\". Religious writers of all persuasions praised his \"noble character and his ardent pursuit of truth\", calling him a \"true Christian gentleman\". In particular the Unitarians and free religionists, proud of his Dissenting upbringing, supported his naturalistic views. William Benjamin Carpenter carried a resolution praising Darwin's unravelling of \"the immutable laws of the Divine Government\", shedding light on \"the progress of humanity\". The Unitarian preacher John Chadwick from New York wrote that \"The nation's grandest temple of religion opened its gates and lifted up its everlasting doors and bade the King of Science come in.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873042", "title": "Helena Normanton", "text": "Helena Normanton\n\nHelena Florence Normanton, KC (14 December 1882 – 14 October 1957) was the first woman to practise as a barrister in England. In November 1922, she was the second woman to be called to the Bar of England and Wales, following the example set by Ivy Williams in May 1922. When she married she kept her surname and in 1924 she was the first British married woman to have a passport in the name she was born with.\n\nNormanton was born in East London to Jane Amelia (nee Marshall) and piano maker William Alexander Normanton. In 1886, when she was just four years old, her father was found dead in a railway tunnel. Her mother, who may already have been separated from her father, a stigmatised position in those days, brought up Helena and her younger sister Ethel alone— letting rooms in the family home, before moving to Brighton to run a grocery and later a boarding house.\n\nNormanton describes the moment she decided to become a barrister in her book, 'Everyday Law for Woman'. She says that as a twelve years old girl, she was visiting a solicitor's office with her mother, who was unable to understand the solicitor’s advice. Normanton recognised this situation as a form of sex discrimination and wished to help all women gain access to the law, which at the time was a profession only open to men.\n\nIn the book, Normanton reflects: \"\"I still do not like to see women getting the worst end of any deal for lack of a little elementary legal knowledge which is the most common form amongst men\".\"\n\nShe read modern history at the University of London as an external student, graduating with first class honours, obtained a Scottish Secondary Teachers' Diploma, and held a diploma in French language, literature and history from Dijon University. She lectured in history at Glasgow University and London University, and began to speak and write about feminist issues. She spoke at meetings of the Women's Freedom League and supported the Indian National Congress.\n\nNormanton held ambitions to become a barrister from a young age. An application to become a student at Middle Temple in 1918 was refused, and she lodged a petition with the House of Lords. She reapplied on 24 December 1919, within hours of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 coming into force, and was admitted to Middle Temple. She married Gavin Bowman Watson Clark in 1921, but preserved her maiden name for professional reasons. In 1924, she became the first married British woman to be issued a passport in her maiden name.\n\nShe was the second woman to be called to the bar, on 17 November 1922, shortly after Ivy Williams. She was the first woman to obtain a divorce for her client, the first woman to lead the prosecution in a murder trial, and the first woman to conduct a trial in America and to appear at the High Court and the Old Bailey. In 1949, along with Rose Heilbron, she was one of the first two women King's Counsel at the English Bar.\nNormanton was a campaigner for women's rights and women's suffrage, becoming the first married woman in Britain to have a passport in her maiden name, believing that men and women should keep their money and property separately. She was also a pacifist, later being a supporter of CND.\n\nTen years after the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, Normanton spoke at the Women’s Engineering Society’s seventh Annual Conference in July 1929, alongside Professor Winifred Cullis, the first woman to hold a professorial chair at a medical school, and architect Edna Mosely. In her speech, Normanton noted that there were \"\"nearly a hundred women solicitors in this country and most of them have brilliant qualifications; she did not believe in any boycott of men in professions, but the women ought at least to be brought into the sphere of action. There was a general muddle as present in regard to the position of women…They might become engineers but not minsters of the Church; they might not enter the sacred portals of the Stock Exchange nor the House of Lords; they could become a Cabinet Minister but not an Ambassador. While any woman was held back from the position to which her talents drew her, the whole of womanhood was lowered\"\".\n\nShe acted as the Honorary Legal Adviser for the Women's Engineering Society from 1936 until 1954, succeeding Theodora Llewelyn Davies in the role. \n\nShe campaigned for divorce reform, and was president of the Married Women's Association until 1952, when the other officials resigned over her memorandum of evidence to the Royal Commission on Divorce, which they regarded as 'anti-man'. Normanton formed a breakaway body called the Council of Married Women.\n\nShe founded the Magna Carta Society. She was a pacifist throughout her life, and demonstrated against the nuclear bomb after the Second World War.\n\nIn February 2019, 218 Strand Chambers rebranded as Normanton Chambers in her honour. This is the first instance of a barristers' chambers being named after a woman.\n\nNormanton died on 14 October 1957, and after cremation was buried with her husband Gavin Bowman Watson Clark in Ovingdean churchyard, Sussex.\n\n\nThe archives of Helena Normanton are held at The Women's Library at the Library of the London School of Economics, ref 7HLN \n\n"}

Her career included many \"firsts\" for a woman – she was the first woman to achieve a first class honours degree in law at the University of Liverpool, the first woman to win a scholarship to Gray's Inn, one of the first two women to be appointed King's Counsel in England, the first woman to lead in a murder case, the first woman recorder, the first woman judge to sit at the Old Bailey, and the first woman treasurer of Gray's Inn. She was also the second woman to be appointed a High Court judge, after Elizabeth Lane.\n\nHeilbron was born in Liverpool, the daughter of a Jewish hotelier, Max Heilbron. He assisted Jews who wanted to emigrate. She attended The Belvedere School and Liverpool University, where she became one of the first two women to gain a first class honours degree in law, in 1935. She was awarded the Lord Justice Holker scholarship at Gray's Inn in 1936, and she became one of only two women to hold a master of laws degree in 1937. Two years later she was called to the bar, and joined the Northern Circuit in 1940.\n\nHeilbron practised mainly in personal injury and criminal law. Her rapid rise may have been aided by the fact that so many men were in the armed forces in the Second World War, during her first six years as a barrister.\n\nShe was junior counsel for the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine in his case in 1944, \"Constantine v Imperial Hotels\", after he was turned away from a hotel due to his colour. In 1946, in \" Adams v Naylor\", she represented two boys injured in a minefield on the beach between Crosby and Southport in a claim against an army officer; the unsuccessful appeal to the House of Lords contributed to the Crown Proceedings Act 1947.\n\nBy 1946, Heilbron had appeared in 10 murder trials, and in 1949, just a few months after the birth of her daughter, she was one of the first two female King's Counsel at the English Bar (the other was Helena Normanton). Aged 34, she was the youngest KC since Thomas Erskine in 1783 when he was aged 33. She became something of a household name, especially in her home city, when, in 1949–50, she became the first woman to lead in a murder case, when she defended the gangster George Kelly, accused of shooting dead the deputy manager of the Cameo Cinema in Liverpool, which became known as the \"Cameo murder\". He reportedly said that he was not \"\"having a Judy defend [him]\"\", but he later praised her for her painstaking defence, which led to her being named the \"Daily Mirror\"s \"Woman of the Year\". She was unable to save Kelly from the gallows, but the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction as unsafe in 2003.\n\nHeilbron's successes in the first half of the 1950s included the defence of four men accused of hanging a boy during a burglary, in which she was able to show that the death had been an accident; and the defence of Louis Bloom, a solicitor from Hartlepool who was accused of murdering his mistress in his office, but was found guilty of manslaughter. However, in 1953 she was unable to save John Todd from the gallows for the murder of a shopkeeper in Aintree.\n\nShe led in several other important cases, included \"Ormrod v Crossville Motor Services\" on vicarious liability in 1953, and \"Sweet v Parsley\" on the presumption of a requirement for \"mens rea\" in criminal offences in 1970.\n\nHeilbron was appointed as Recorder for Burnley in November 1956, the first appointment of a woman as Recorder, although not the first time one had sat. (Sybil Campbell was appointed a metropolitan stipendiary magistrate in 1945, and Dorothy Knight Dix was the first woman to preside at a jury trial in 1946, as deputy recorder of Deal). In 1957, she was the first woman to sit as a Commissioner of Assize. Elizabeth Lane was appointed the first female judge in the County Court in 1962 and of the High Court in 1965, but Heilbron was appointed as the first female judge to sit at the Old Bailey on 4 January 1972. She became leader of the Northern Circuit in 1973 and then followed Lane as the second woman High Court judge in 1974. Despite her background in criminal cases, which would have naturally suited her to the Queen's Bench Division, she was assigned to the Family Division, and created a DBE. She took charge of many criminal cases while presiding judge of the Northern Circuit (the first woman Presiding Judge of any Circuit) from 1979 to 1982.\n\nIn 1975, the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, appointed Heilbron to chair a committee to consider reform of rape laws. The committee's subsequent report recommended that the identity of rape complainants should be kept secret, and that the defence should be limited in its ability to cross-examine the complainant about their sexual history in an effort to attack their character. In 1976, she was made an honorary fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.\n\nShe became a bencher at Gray's Inn in 1968, and was the first woman to head one of the four Inns of Court when she became its Treasurer in 1985. She retired from judicial office in 1988.\n\nHer hobbies included golf and walking, and she was a keen member of Soroptimist, the worldwide organisation for women in management and the professions, working to advance human rights and the status of women. She was an honorary Colonel of the East Lancashire Battalion of the WRAC. It was reported that she was the first woman in Liverpool to wear a calf-length evening dress.\n\nIn 1945, she married the Dublin-born general practitioner, Dr Nathaniel Burstein (1905–2010). He became a consultant at a Liverpool hospital, and there is little doubt that the availability of medical knowledge was a great help to her in some cases. Her daughter, Hilary, was born in January 1949; Hilary also became a barrister and was in 1987 appointed a QC, the 29th woman so honoured.\n\nHeilbron and her husband had moved from Liverpool to London when she was appointed a High Court judge. She died in a nursing home in Islington, of pneumonia and cerebrovascular ischaemia, survived by her husband and daughter. A biography of Rose Heilbron by her daughter Hilary was published in 2012.\n\n"}
{"id": "1873046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873046", "title": "Zvi Yehuda Kook", "text": "Zvi Yehuda Kook\n\nZvi Yehuda Kook (, 23 April 1891 – 9 March 1982) was an Orthodox rabbi, a prominent leader of Religious Zionism, and Rosh Yeshiva of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva. He was the son of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook,\nthe first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine.\n\nHis teachings are partially responsible for the modern religious settlement movement in Judea and Samaria. Many of his ideological followers in the Religious Zionist movement settled there.\n\nUnder the leadership of Kook, with its center in the yeshiva founded by his father, Jerusalem's Mercaz HaRav, thousands of Orthodox Jews campaigned actively against territorial compromise, and established numerous settlements throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Many of these settlements were subsequently granted official recognition by Israeli governments, both right and left.\n\nZvi Yehuda Kook was born in 1891 in Zaumel in the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Žeimelis in Northern Lithuania), where his father served as rabbi. His mother was his father's second wife, Reiza Rivka, the niece of Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim, Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem together with Shmuel Salant. Kook was named after his maternal grandfather, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Rabinowitz-Teomim.\n\nIn 1896, his father, with his entire family, moved to Bauska, Latvia, to serve as rabbi there. There Zvi Yehuda Kook studied Talmud under the guidance of Rabbi Reuven Gotfreud, the son-in-law of Rabbi Yoel Moshe Salomon, the founder of Petakh Tiqva. Later, he studied under R. Moshe Zeidel and Benjamin Levin. His principal teacher, however, remained his father throughout his life. His father also hired a private tutor to teach him Russian.\n\nIn 1904, at age 13, he moved to Jaffa, when his father was appointed Chief Rabbi of the city, then part of Ottoman-controlled Palestine. Like his father, he would celebrate on each year the date of his ascent to Land of Israel, on the 28th day of Iyyar.\n\nIn 1906, Zvi Yehuda Kook went to study at one of the most prominent yeshivas in Jerusalem at that time, Torat Chaim, in the future building of Ateret Cohanim. There, he became close to the Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Zerakh Epstein, despite being relatively young (around 15).\n\nHis studies there, however, did not last long. He soon returned to Jaffa, where he assisted his father in an attempt establish a yeshiva in Jaffa. During this time, he began his close relationship with Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Charlap, a disciple of his father and future dean of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, and assisted Charlap in publishing \"Tzvi laTzadik\".\n\nIn 1910, at age 19, he assisted his father in publishing \"Shabbat Haaretz\" on the sale permit for the Sabbatical year, even writing some of the Halachic preface.\n\nSeeing he lacked time to truly study Torah like most people his age, he decided to remove himself from public activity for some time. First, he went to Porat Yoseph, the leading Sephardic yeshiva of Jerusalem. Then, he left to Halberstadt, Germany, and studied there in the local yeshiva. He also attended lectures at the local university. In addition to his own studies, Kook taught Talmud, Halacha, and Bible to young men in the area.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was arrested as a citizen of the Russian Empire, the enemy country. After several weeks under difficult conditions in a detention camp in Hamburg, he was released and allowed to return to Halberstadt, where he needed to report once every two days in the local office. Only the following year, at the end of 1915, was he granted permission to leave Germany and join his father in Switzerland, where he was stuck due to the war. There he learned with his father, until his father left in 1916 to fill a rabbinic position in London.\n\nIn 1920, he returned to Palestine (then under the British Mandate) and began teaching at Netzakh Israel school. A year later, he went to Europe to promote his father's new movement, \"Degel Yerushalayim\", among the leading rabbis of Europe.\n\nIn 1922, he married Chava Leah Hutner in Warsaw. Chava Leah died childless in 1944, and Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda remained a widower until his death nearly 40 years later. From 1923, he served as the administrative director of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva. After Rabbi Charlap died in 1952, he became Rosh Yeshiva until his own death. After the Six-Day War in 1967, he induced the Israeli government to approve the building of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, and sent his students to that mission. He tried to strengthen the Chief Rabbinate, which he saw as the precursor of the future Sanhedrin.\n\nHe passed away in Jerusalem on Purim of 1982, and was buried in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery.\n\nRabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook saw in the establishment of the modern State of Israel a major step in the redemption of the Jewish people. Many Torah scholars rejected the Zionist movement because they envisioned redemption as a future era that arrives complete from the very start, and not an ongoing process. But Talmudic Sages taught that the redemption will take place \"little by little\", like the spreading light of dawn in the morning sky. This indicates that the redemption of Israel is a process that advances in stages. Furthermore, Rabbi Kook would note that the various stages of redemption are clearly described in the order of Ezekiel's prophecy (). Ezekiel first spoke of an initial stage of redemption, the ingathering of the exiles; only after that initial stage does the prophet describe the spiritual return of the people.\n\nRabbi Kook disapproved of religious coercion in Israel and even gave his support to the 'League for the Prevention of Religious Coercion.' In a newspaper interview, he explained, \"I said at the time to the members of the 'League' that they were absolutely right: I hate religious coercion. With what sort of justice, and with what kind of integrity can one impose religion on a person?\"\n\nHe greatly respected Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach for his love for every Jew. When his students were surprised to see him meet with Carlebach - the \"Singing Rabbi\" known for his efforts to reach out to young men and women on the margins of Jewish society, he told them, \"You should know, [Carlebach] goes to places that none of you ever go.\"\n\nHe staunchly opposed any political moves to relinquish parts of the Land of Israel.\n\"We are not a nation of conquerors. We are returning to the land of our fathers. No one, no prime minister, has the authority to renounce any part of the country. It belongs to the entire people of Israel, to the Jews of Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Union.\"\n\nRabbi Zvi Yehuda greatly admired Rabbi Meir Kahane and his activism on behalf of Jewry. When Rabbi Kahane formed a political party, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda endorsed his bid for a Knesset seat. Though he had originally been a staunch supporter of the National Religious Party, he broke with them in 1974 after they entered the Rabin government over his opposition. In his letter of support to Kahane, he stated: \"The presence of Rabbi Meir Kahane and his uncompromising words from the Knesset platform will undoubtedly add strength and value to the obligatory struggle on behalf of the entire Land of Israel.\" The announcement of his support of Rabbi Kahane and his letter were made available to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.\n\nAccording to his student Rabbi Uzi Kalheim, however, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook's support of Rabbi Kahane was more nuanced. The rabbi approved of Kahane's activities in the U.S. to protect Jews and bolster Jewish pride. But in Israel, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda did not agree with Kahane's positions. He felt that Rabbi Kahane should be able to serve in the Knesset and express his opinions there, but he himself did not agree with his views. He explicitly wrote that his support for Kahane was \"without any identification with or connection to the specifics of his words and aims\".\n\nRabbi Kook's view was that Israel's struggle with the Arabs over the Land of Israel is a national one. The rights of individual minorities, however, must be respected. Thus, when the Israeli High Court ruled that the Elon Moreh group of settlers had to evacuate lands of the Rujeib village, which was under Palestinian ownership, the rabbi told his followers to abide by the court's verdict, even though his ideological view was that \"there is no such thing as Arab land in Eretz Israel.\" Benny Katzover recalled: \"The rabbi told us several times, 'We cannot damage land belonging to Ahmad and Mustafa', that we couldn't touch lands that had belonged to Arabs for generations.\"\n\nRabbi Kook's approach is also apparent in a letter he wrote in 1947. The rabbi lodged a complaint with the principal and teachers at a Jewish school in Jerusalem after he witnessed a group of students physically and verbally harassing two Arab street vendors. \"I was deeply pained and ashamed at what I saw\", Rabbi Kook wrote. \"This incident, which pained and embarrassed me, requires me to inform you of the need for particular attention to educate against such actions. Students must be taught that such behavior is prohibited - both due to the essential teachings of Torah, Judaism, and morality, and also due to the practical value for the Jewish community and maintaining peaceful relations with neighbors.\"\n\nSometimes called the \"prophet of Greater Israel,\" Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook was the leader of the now defunct settler movement, Gush Emunim. Their beliefs are based heavily on the teachings of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda's father, Rabbi Abraham Kook. The two rabbis taught that secular Zionists, through their conquests of the Land of Israel (\"Eretz Yisrael\"), had unwittingly brought about the beginning of the \"final redemption\", which would end in the coming of the Jewish messiah. Gush Emunim supporters believe that building Jewish settlement on land God has allotted to the Jewish people as outlined in the Hebrew Bible, is an important step in the process of redemption. Like his father, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, Kook (whom some called \"the Father of the Return to Judea and Samaria\") did not advocate aggressive conquest.\n\nRabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook rarely gave lectures in the traditional yeshiva subjects of Halakha and Gemarah. This was not due to lack of knowledge, as his writings readily prove his expertise in these topics. Rather, he felt that his goal is to teach \"Emunah\" (Jewish thought). Once, a student asked him to deliver a Gemarah lecture, and the rabbi refused, explaining that his life project is to teach \"Emunah\". His attitude to \"Emunah\" was influenced by his father, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. Rabbi Kook (the father) wrote frequently about the need to study \"Emunah\", especially in our generation. One notable example is the essay titled, \"\"Me'at Tzori\"\" in his book \"Eder Haykar\".\n\nIn many yeshivot, there is little or no study of \"Emunah\" texts. In the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, where Rabbi Zvi Yehuda served as the yeshiva's dean for many years, there are many lectures on this topic, and students devote around one hour a day studying \"Emunah\".\n\nRabbi Tzvi Yehuda held the previous generations of rabbis in the highest regard. He would quote the Talmudic proverb: \"If the earlier generations were like angels, then we are like people. And if the earlier generations were like human beings, then we are like donkeys.\"\n\nIn his writings, there are references to many of the major rabbis of earlier generations. For example, in the book \"Mitoch Hatorah Hagoelet\", he wrote that the first Rebbe of Chabad, the author of the Tanya, was a \"great man\", but the Vilna Gaon was even greater.\n\nThe most well known among his students are rabbis Shlomo Aviner, Zvi Thau, Zalman Melamed, Yitzchak Sheilat, Avihu Schwartz, Dov Lior, Zephaniah Drori, Issar Klonsky, Haim Steiner, Yoel Bin-Nun, Eliezer Melamed, David Samson, Moshe Ganz, Nachum Romm, Haim Drukman, Aharon Shear-Yashuv, Moshe Levinger, and Yaakov Ariel. Numerous yeshivas in Israel follow his teachings.\n\nRabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook did not publish any books, but many of his articles and letters were later collected and published in book form. Additionally, there are collections of his lectures.\n\n\n"}

It was situated in the northern Rhineland on both sides of the Lower Rhine, around its capital Cleves and the towns of Wesel, Kalkar, Xanten, Emmerich, Rees and Duisburg bordering the lands of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster in the east and the Duchy of Brabant in the west. Its history is closely related to that of its southern neighbours: the Duchies of Jülich and Berg, as well as Guelders and the Westphalian county of Mark. The Duchy was archaically known as \"Cleveland\" in English.\n\nThe duchy's territory roughly covered the present-day German districts of Cleves (northern part), Wesel and the city of Duisburg, as well as adjacent parts of the Limburg, North Brabant and Gelderland provinces in the Netherlands.\n\nIn the early 11th century Emperor Henry II entrusted the administration of the \"Klever Reichswald\", a large forested area around the \"Kaiserpfalz\" at Nijmegen directly subordinate to the Imperial rule, to local Lower Lorrainian nobles at Geldern and Kleve. A County of Cleves (; ) was first mentioned in the 11th century. In 1417, the county became a duchy. Upon the death of Count Johann in 1368, the fief was inherited by his nephew Adolf III of the Marck. Cleves and the Marck were finally ruled in personal union by the House of La Marck after Adolf's elder brother Count Engelbert III had died without issue in 1391. King Sigismund of Germany raised Count Adolph I to the status of a duke and a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1417.\nThe Cleves-Mark territories became one of the most significant estates of the Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle in 1500, rivaled by the Prince-Bishops of Münster. In 1511 John III of La Marck, son of Duke John II of Cleves, by his marriage with Maria inherited the fiefs of Jülich and Berge upon the death of his father-in-law Duke William IV. When John III succeeded his father as Duke of Cleves in 1521, the states of Jülich, Berge, Cleves and Mark formed the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. His daughter Anne of Cleves (1515–1557) even became Queen Consort of England for a few months in 1540, as her brother William, duke since 1539, quarrelled with Emperor Charles V over the possession of Guelders and sought support from King Henry VIII.\n\nWhen the last duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berge died issueless in 1609, the War of the Jülich succession broke out. The lands were finally divided between the Wittelsbach dukes of Palatinate-Neuburg (Jülich and Berge) and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, who gained Cleves with Mark and Ravensberg according to the 1614 Treaty of Xanten. The Hohenzollern margraves thereby got a first foothold in the Rhineland; however, large parts of the Duchy of Cleves were occupied by the United Provinces until the Franco-Dutch War in 1672. Finally incorporated into Brandenburg-Prussia by the Great Elector Frederick William I of Brandenburg in 1666 and part of the Kingdom of Prussia after 1701, Cleves was occupied by French forces in the Seven Years' War (1757–1762).\n\nIn 1795 the Duchy of Cleves west of the Rhine and Wesel was occupied by France, and became part of the French département of the Roer. The rest of the duchy was occupied between 1803 and 1805, and became part of the département of Yssel-Supérieur and the puppet-state Grand Duchy of Berg (after 1811, the département of Lippe). In 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon, the duchy became part of the Prussian Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, which merged in the Prussian Rhine Province in 1822. The cities Gennep, Zevenaar, and Huissen became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a result of the 1815 Congress of Vienna.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873055", "title": "Royal Berkshire Hospital", "text": "Royal Berkshire Hospital\n\nThe Royal Berkshire Hospital is a National Health Service hospital in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire. It provides acute hospital services to the residents of the western and central portions of Berkshire, and is managed by the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nThe hospital provides approximately 813 inpatient beds (627 acute, 66 paediatrics and 120 maternity), together with 204-day beds and spaces. In doing so, it employs over 5,000 staff and has an annual budget of £228 million.\n\nThe Royal Berkshire Hospital was opened in 1839 on the London Road on land donated by Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth, a local resident and former Prime Minister. The hospital was built by local architect and builder Henry Briant, who won the design competition. King William IV took a keen interest in the hospital before it was built and as a consequence, his arms appear on the central pediment, although he died before the hospital opened. The first patron of the hospital was William's niece and successor, Queen Victoria.\n\nIn the 1860s, the original building was extended with east and west wings designed by Joseph Morris. In the 1880s, a new chapel was added to the rear of the main block, together with long side wings. Both chapel and side wings were also designed by Morris.\n\nIn 1993, the \"Royal Berkshire and Battle Hospitals NHS Trust\" was formed, to manage both the Royal Berkshire Hospital and Battle Hospital, the town's other general hospital. On 24 February 2006, The Queen accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh opened the new buildings of the Royal Berkshire Hospital. This was to celebrate the completion of an eight-year project to move the Battle Hospital services onto the Royal Berkshire Hospital site. In August of the same year, the trust became an NHS Foundation Trust under the name of \"Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust\", reflecting both its new status and the closure of Battle Hospital.\n\nIn 2008, the hospital was awarded 'Excellent' for its use of resources and 'Good' for the quality of its services in the Healthcare Commission's annual health check of all the hospitals within the National Health Service. The accident and emergency department is consistently one of the most efficient in the country, with more than 99% of patients being seen and treated, admitted or discharged within four hours.\n\nIn August 2010, it was reported that the number of jobs in the hospital would be reduced by 600, out of a total of around 4,000, to achieve a saving of £60 million. In October 2013, as part of a screening process by the Care Quality Commission, based on existing data and intended for use in prioritising inspections, the Trust was put into the highest risk category.\n\nOn 5 March 2020, a patient at the Royal Berkshire Hospital was the first confirmed UK fatality from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe hospital occupies a long thin site, running gently uphill from London Road to Addington Road, and flanked by Craven Road and Redlands Road. The buildings that house the hospital are of various ages, from the original building of 1839 to the latest ward block built in 2006. Despite the various ages and styles of building, almost all of the hospital's departments are accessible from a single indoor pedestrian route that runs the length of the site. The original entrance on London Road still exists, but the main entrance is now situated in Craven Road, roughly at the midpoint of this route.\n\nThe original building of 1839, together with the wings added in the 1860s, are now listed grade II* by English Heritage. They are built of Bath Stone with slate roofs, and the main building comprises 2 storeys and a basement. The frontage has 11 bays, with the central 7 bays forming a projecting pedimented hexastyle portico with Ionic columns.\n\nAmongst the buildings within the hospital complex is the old laundry, built in 1881. This now houses the museum of the Berkshire Medical Heritage Centre, which contains 3,000 artefacts relating to medicine, surgery, nursing, midwifery, pharmacy and dentistry. Some of the exhibits date back to the 17th century.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873056", "title": "Prospective memory", "text": "Prospective memory\n\nProspective memory is a form of memory that involves remembering to perform a planned action or recall a planned intention at some future point in time. Prospective memory tasks are common in daily life and range from the relatively simple to extreme life-or-death situations. Examples of simple tasks include remembering to put the toothpaste cap back on, remembering to reply to an email, or remembering to return a rented movie. Examples of highly important situations include a patient remembering to take medication or a pilot remembering to perform specific safety procedures during a flight.\n\nIn contrast to prospective memory, retrospective memory involves remembering people, events, or words that have been encountered in the past. Whereas retrospective memory requires only the recall of past events, prospective memory requires the exercise of retrospective memory at a time that has not yet occurred. Prospective memory is thus considered a form of \"memory of the future\".\n\nRetrospective memory involves the memory of what we know, containing informational content; prospective memory focuses on when to act, rather than focusing on informational content. There is some evidence demonstrating the role of retrospective memory in the successful execution of prospective memory, but this role seems to be relatively small.\n\nThere are two types of prospective memory: event-based and time-based prospective memory. Event-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform certain actions when specific circumstances occur. For example, driving past the local library cues the remembrance of the need to return an overdue book. Time-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform an action at a particular point in time. For example, seeing that it is 10:00 PM acts as a cue to watch a favorite television show.\n\nResearch performed by Sellen et al. (1997) compared event-based and time-based cues on prospective memory tasks. The experimenters gave participants a place (event-based cue) and a time (time-based cue) and were told to press a button each time those cues appeared during the study. It was found that performance on event-based tasks was better than performance on time-based tasks, even when participants took more time to think about their responses. The difference in task performance between the two types of prospective memory suggests that the intended action was better triggered by external cues of the event-based task than internal cues of the time-based task. External cues, as opposed to internal cues, act as a prompt for better performance, making it easier to complete event-based tasks.\n\nMcDaniel et al. (2004) further distinguished event-based prospective memory into immediate-execute tasks and delayed-execute tasks. Immediate-execute tasks involve a response as soon as a particular cue is noticed, while delayed-execute tasks involve delays between the perception of the relevant cue and the performance of the intended action. Delayed-execute tasks more commonly occur in real life when circumstances of a situation prevent intermediate action once the cue has been perceived. Research was performed by McDaniel et al. (2004), in which participants completed tasks involving various delays and interruptions between cues and responses. It was demonstrated that correct performance suffered when there was a delay or interruption during a task. However, it was further shown that the use of reminders for participants eliminated the effects of the interruption task.\n\nThere is great interest about the possible mechanisms and resources that underlie the workings of prospective memory.\n\nThe preparatory attentional and memory (PAM) theory proposes two types of processes involved in successful prospective memory performance. The first component of this theory involves a monitoring process that begins when a person constructs an intention that is then maintained until it is performed. This monitoring component involves a capacity-consuming process, similar to those used when maintaining attention, because there is a need for the intention to be stored and maintained in memory. The second component involves the use of elements of retrospective memory processes. These elements are used to differentiate between the wanted prospective memory intention and unwanted thoughts, in an attempt to keep focus on the goal and not the other options surrounding it. Retrospective memory is also used to remember specifically what intention is supposed to be performed in the future, and the monitoring process is needed to be able to remember to perform this action at the correct condition or time.\n\nAccording to this theory, prospective memory should be enhanced when complete attention is given to the desired task than when attention is divided among multiple tasks. Research conducted by McDaniel et al. (1998) attempted to prove that prospective memory performance is better on focused tasks as opposed to those where attention is split. Subjects completed a prospective memory task in either a condition where full attention was given or a condition where attention was divided on other tasks. The results were consistent with the PAM theory, showing that participants' prospective memory performance was better with full attention.\n\nHowever, there is a lot of scepticism that the rather complex mechanisms of the PAM theory are required for all, sometimes mundane, prospective memory tasks. In research by Reese and Cherry (2002), participants formed an intention to act in the future, but were interrupted prior to acting on their intention when the cue was present. When participants were asked their thoughts at the moment of interruption, only 2% reported that they were thinking of the original intention. This demonstrated evidence against the PAM theory, that there is constant maintenance from the time of constructing the intention to acting upon it at the right circumstance.\n\nFurther research conducted by Einstein and McDaniel in 1990, found that subjects during prospective memory tasks reported that their intention often \"popped\" into mind, instead of being constantly monitored and consciously maintained. Another theory was proposed in 2000, called the reflexive-associative theory, which states that when people create an intention for a prospective memory task, they make an association between the target cue and the intended action. Later when the target cue occurs, the automatic associative-memory system triggers the retrieval of the intended action and brings it back into conscious awareness. Therefore, as long as the target cue occurs, the association previously made will initiate the retrieval of the intended action, regardless of whether the intention is in consciousness.\n\nAnother theory that has been used to explain the mechanisms of prospective memory is the multi-process model proposed by McDaniel and Einstein (2005). This theory states that prospective memory retrieval does not always need an active monitoring process but can occur spontaneously (i.e., the occurrence of a cue can cause the intention to be retrieved, even when no preparatory attentional processes are engaged). Therefore, multiple processes can be used for successful prospective memory. Further, it was believed that it would be maladaptive to rely solely on active monitoring because it requires a lot of attentional resources. This may potentially interfere with other forms of processing that are required for different tasks during the retention interval.\nProspective memory cues will lead to spontaneous retrieval of an intention when at least one of four conditions is met: the cue and target action are highly associated with each other, the cue is salient, the other processes performed during the period between cue and action of the prospective memory task direct attention to relevant cue features (e.g., task appropriate processing), or the intended action is simple. Further research has found that although many aspects of prospective memory tasks are automatic, they do involve a small amount of processing. An experiment conducted by Einstein et al. (2005) found that some participants performed slower on a filler task when performing a prospective memory task at the same time. Even though some of the participants did not engage in active monitoring, they showed nearly the same rate of success on the task, demonstrating the use of multiple processes for prospective memory performance.\n\nAs prospective memory involves remembering and fulfilling an intention, it requires episodic memory, declarative memory, and retrospective memory, followed by supervisory executive functions. All of these are controlled by the frontal lobe which is situated at the front of the cerebral hemisphere.\n\nStudies using positron emission tomography (PET) trace a slight increase in blood flow to the frontal lobe in participants completing prospective memory tasks involving remembering a planned action, while performing other tasks. During these procedures, sites of brain activation include the prefrontal cortex, specifically the right dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and medial regions, as well as the median frontal lobe. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for holding the intention in consciousness and suppressing other internal thoughts. The median frontal lobe keeps attention focused on the planned action instead of the other tasks.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is involved mainly in event-based as opposed to time-based prospective memory. Cheng et al. (2008) had participants with lesions in the prefrontal cortex perform event-based and time-based prospective memory tasks. They found that performance was impaired in the event-based tasks, which use event cues to trigger intentions, but not in the time-based tasks which use time cues to trigger intentions.\n\nOther lesion studies have also shown the use of the frontal lobe in remembering and focusing on intentions. Burgess et al. (2000) studied patients with lesions to areas in the frontal lobe such as Brodmann's area 10, finding that these patients failed to follow instructions and switch attention during prospective memory tasks.\n\nThe parietal lobe is typically involved in processing sensory information and is situated in the superior region of the brain.\n\nFor prospective memory, the parietal lobe is important for recognizing cues that trigger an intended action, especially when the cues are visual or spatial. The parietal lobe is also responsible for maintaining attention on the intended action and inhibiting other activities during performance. Studies using PET have shown that the parietal lobe is activated when participants engage in prospective memory tasks involving visual information such as remembering a series of numbers. Activation of the parietal lobe is also evident in studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) which traces electric activity of the brain.\n\nHarrington et al. (1998) found that neural areas ranging from the inferior parietal cortex to the frontal gyri are involved in temporal monitoring during time-based prospective memory tasks. Patients with damage to these areas of the brain had difficulty judging duration and frequency of auditory tones that were presented. Keeping track of information over time is important for prospective memory, remembering intentions to perform in the future.\n\nMuch of the limbic system, which contains primitive brain structures relating to emotion and motivation, are involved in memory.\n\nMethods that test prospective memory require the distinction between retrospective memory, which is remembering information, and prospective memory, which is remembering information for the future. Prospective memory requires retrospective memory because one must remember the information itself in order to act in the future. For example, remembering to buy groceries after work (prospective memory) requires the ability to remember what type of groceries are needed (retrospective memory). While prospective memory and retrospective memory are connected, they are distinguishable. This makes it possible to separate these two processes during tests.\n\nProspective memory tasks can be used in a variety of ways to assess prospective memory. Firstly, results from these tasks can directly assess prospective memory. Furthermore, these tasks can be performed while experimenters use PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or MEG to monitor brain activation. Finally, these tasks can be followed by questionnaires about prospective memory. Combining different assessments can confirm or deny experimental findings, making sure that conclusions about prospective memory are accurate. All tasks can assess individual stages of prospective memory such as the formation or execution of an intention, or access prospective memory as a whole by looking at overall performance.\n\nTechnological assessments were created in order to more appropriately evaluate prospective memory by combining real life intentions with experimental control.\n\nThere is an increasing amount of research on the effect of age on prospective memory where typical studies compare groups of people from different ages. A study by Smith et al. (2010) comparing event-based prospective memory in schoolchildren (7–10 years old) and young adults found that adults had better memory performance. Another study by Kvavilashvili et al. (2009) comparing time-based prospective memory among young adults (18- to 30-year-olds), young-old adults (60- to 75-year-olds) and old-old adults (76- to 90-year-olds) showed that young adults had better performance. Event-based prospective memory was further compared between young-old and old-old adults and findings were that young-old adults performed better than old-old adults. These studies suggested that there is continual improvement of prospective memory from childhood into young adulthood but that a decline begins in late adulthood.\n\nA study comparing prospective memory of non-psychotic first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia and control participants showed that the relatives performed significantly worse on time-based and event-based prospective memory tasks. Since schizophrenia has a heritable component, this suggested that genetics may play a role in affecting prospective memory.\n\nMany diseases and disorders negatively affect prospective memory, as well as source memory, item recognition, and temporal order memory. The effects range from mild cognitive impairments to more detrimental impairments such as early onset dementia.\n\nThe effect of pregnancy on prospective memory is still under current study. Rendell et al. (2008) tested the prospective memory of 20 pregnant women in the laboratory. There were no significant differences observed between pregnant and non-pregnant women for event-based prospective memory tasks, but there were clear hindrances in performance for pregnant women in time-based prospective memory tasks such as a job deadline. Pregnant women are more likely to remember to perform an intention after the cue has already passed. Further, women tested a few months after giving birth were found to forget intentions entirely. Both these findings may be related to stress encountered during pregnancy or child rearing and lack of sleep.\n\nEmotional target cues have been shown to eliminate age differences in prospective memory. For older participants, emotional prospective memory cues were better remembered than neutral cues. Whether the cues are positive or negative, strong emotional attachment makes the cue more self-relevant and easier to remember. For example, an aversive picture of a snake biting a person or a positive picture of a dog licking its owner are easier to remember because they evoke emotional responses, as opposed to a neutral picture of an animal that does not evoke an emotional response. It is speculated that the amygdala and hippocampus may play a role in this emotionally enhanced memory effect.\n\nIn a study by Kliegel et al. (2008), it was shown that motivational state affected performance in two age groups (three-year-olds and five-year-olds) completing the same prospective memory task. There was no difference for the two age groups when motivation was high but performance of the three years old was reduced when motivation was low. If a person considers a task to be unimportant or is affected by fatigue, they will not be motivated to remember the intention. Less attention will be given to relevant cues and the memory is more likely to be forgotten. Therefore, prospective memory can be enhanced by avoiding low motivational states.\n\nVarious studies have reported that 50-80% of all everyday memories are, at least in part, related to prospective memory. Prospective memory is crucial for normal functioning since people form future intentions and remember to carry out past intentions on a daily basis. Numerous aspects of daily life require prospective memory, ranging from ordinary activities such as remembering where to meet a friend, to more important tasks such as remembering what time to take medication.\n\nThere is a complicated relationship between prospective memory and time management skills which include making lists, scheduling activities, and avoiding interruptions. Studies have not identified distinct cause and effect relationships between prospective memory and time management, but many consistent correlations have been observed. For example, people who reported better prospective memory according to the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) also indicated a higher likelihood of setting goals and priorities and being more organized. There may be a cyclical effect between prospective memory and time management: better memory may lead to better organization, and better organization may further lead to better memory.\n\nAviation controllers are often occupied with multiple tasks at the same time, and hazardous effects can occur when prospective memory fails. In an accident in 1991, a tower controller in an airport forgot a step in a simple procedure and that led to two planes crashing into each other, killing a number of passengers and crew. An analysis of over 1300 fatal aviation accidents from 1950-2009 showed that the majority were due to pilot error: 50% attributed to pilot error, 6% due to non-pilot human error, 22% to mechanical failure, 12% to bad weather, 9% to sabotage, and 1% to other causes.\n\nThe nursing environment is full of event-based and time-based prospective memory tasks. Simple tasks such as remembering to order a drug or calling patient's family and remembering when to switch shifts are just some examples of a nurse's reliance on prospective memory. It is surprising that not much research has been done concerning the importance of prospective memory in nurses since they face many life-threatening tasks.\n\nProspective memory is required to remember when to take oral contraceptive pills. A study performed by Matter and Meier (2008) showed that women who self-reported higher prospective memory ability were more satisfied with oral contraceptive use and experienced lower stress levels. Having better memory makes it is easier for these women to remind themselves to take their contraceptives at the required time of the day.\n\nWith advancements in technology, Smartphones can serve as prospective memory aids. Electronic calendars are of great use in time-based prospective memory tasks and recently they have been shown to also cue event-based tasks. The iPhone, as well as phones using the Android operating system, can track the user's location using the phone's Global Positioning System (GPS) and send reminders based on the current location. For example, when a parent is near their children's school, the phone can send a reminder for them to pick up their children after school.\n\nProspective memory has been implicated in the steering cognition model of how children coordinate their attention and response to learning tasks in school. Walker and Walker showed that pupils able to adjust their prospective memory most accurately for different curriculum learning tasks in maths, science and English were more effective learners than pupils whose prospective memory was fixed or inflexible.\n\nAttempts to find wanted or missing individuals through public alert systems sometimes make use of a type of event based prospective memory called prospective person memory. In prospective person memory, a picture of a wanted or missing person is presented to the public with instructions to report any sightings of the individual to authorities. Field experiments show that prospective person memory is often quite poor.\n\n"}

The child might be said to be \"marked\" as a result.\n\nMaternal impression, according to a long-discredited medical theory, was a phenomenon that explained the existence of birth defects and congenital disorders. The theory stated that an emotional stimulus experienced by a pregnant woman could influence the development of the fetus. For example, it was sometimes supposed that the mother of the Elephant Man was frightened by an elephant during her pregnancy, thus \"imprinting\" the memory of the elephant onto the gestating fetus. Mental problems, such as schizophrenia and depression, were believed to be a manifestation of similar disordered feelings in the mother. For instance, a pregnant woman who experienced great sadness might imprint depressive tendencies onto the fetus in her womb.\n\nThe theory of maternal impression was largely abandoned by the 20th century, with the development of modern genetic theory.\n\nIn folklore, maternal imprinting, or Versehen (a German noun meaning \"inadvertance\" or as a verb \"to provide\") as it is usually called, is the belief that a sudden fear of some object or animal in a pregnant woman can cause her child to bear the mark of it.\n\nOswald Spengler understood maternal imprinting to be a folkloric understanding of what he called \"blood feeling\" or the formation of a group aesthetic of a bodily ideal:\nWhat is called the \"Versehen\" of a pregnant woman is only a particular and not very important instance of the workings of a very deep and powerful formative principle inherent in all that is of the race side. It is a matter of common observation that elderly married people become strangely like one another, although probably Science with its measuring instruments would \"prove\" the exact opposite. It is impossible to exaggerate the formative power of this living pulse, this strong inward feeling for the perfection of one's own type. The feeling for race-beauty—so opposite to the conscious taste of ripe urbans for intellectual-individual traits of beauty—is immensely strong in primitive men, and for that very reason never emerges into their consciousness. But such a feeling is race-forming. It undoubtedly molded the warrior- and hero-type of a nomad tribe more and definitely on \"one bodily ideal\", so that it would have been quite unambiguous to speak of the race-figure of Romans or Ostrogoths.\n\nPliny the Elder also comments at length about the phenomenon of \"postpartum\" maternal impression in bears, i.e., the folk belief that newborn bears must be licked and molded into bear-shape by their mothers.\n\n\n"}

The museum was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was later included in a National Historic Landmark District along with the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works and Fonthill. These three structures are the only poured-in-place concrete structures built by Mercer.\n\nHenry Mercer was a gentleman anthropologist. On a cruise up the Ruhr in early adulthood, Mercer was impressed by the eclipse of artisanal culture by industrial production, and resolved himself to preserving artifacts of preindustrial life.

He gets involved with a local girl he meets on the Staten Island Ferry, and decides he wants to get married and settle down. As their relationship deepens, he declines her offer to have sex because he thinks she is a virgin and he wants to wait rather than \"spoil\" her.\n\nOne day, his girlfriend tells him that she was once raped by a former boyfriend. This crushes J.R., and he rejects her and attempts to return to his old life of drinking with his friends. However, after a particularly wild party with friends, he realizes he still loves her and returns to her apartment one early morning. He awkwardly tells her that he forgives her and says that he will \"marry her anyway.\" Upon hearing this, the girl tells him marriage would never work if her past weighs on him so much. J.R. becomes enraged and calls her a whore, but quickly recants and says he is confused by the whole situation. She tells him to go home, and he returns to the Catholic church, but finds no solace.\n\nMartin Scorsese appears in an uncredited role as a gangster.\n\n\"Who's That Knocking at My Door\" was filmed over the course of several years, undergoing many changes, new directions and different names along the way. The film began in 1965 as a student short film about J.R. and his do-nothing friends called \"Bring on the Dancing Girls\". In 1967, the romance plot with Zina Bethune was introduced and spliced together with the earlier film, and the title was changed to \"I Call First\". This version of the film received its world premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival in November 1967. Finally, in 1968, exploitation distributor Joseph Brenner offered to buy the picture and distribute it on the condition that a sex scene be added to give the film sex exploitation angles for marketing purposes. Scorsese shot and edited a technically beautiful but largely gratuitous montage of J.R. fantasizing about bedding a series of prostitutes (shot in Amsterdam, the Netherlands with a visibly older Keitel) and the film finally became \"Who's That Knocking at My Door\" (named for the 1959 song by The Genies which closes the film). The film was then re-issued under the title \"J.R.\" in 1970, however all subsequent releases have been published under the 1968 title.\n\nThe film was shot with a combination of 35 mm and 16 mm cameras. Scorsese shot most of the 35 mm footage with a Mitchell BNC camera, a very cumbersome camera that impeded mobility. He opted to shoot several scenes with the 16 mm Eclair NPR camera in order to introduce greater mobility, then blow up the footage to 35 mm.\n\nAmerican critic Roger Ebert gave the film an extremely positive review after its world premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival in November 1967 (when it still went by the name \"I Call First\"). He called the film \"a work that is absolutely genuine, artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere. I have no reservations in describing it as a great moment in American movies.\"\n\nWhen the film finally received its theatrical release two years later, Ebert admitted that he had been perhaps a little over eager with his first review, admitting that \"Scorsese was occasionally too obvious, and the film has serious structural flaws.\" However, he was still highly positive towards the film, and suggested that \"It is possible that with more experience and maturity Scorsese will direct more polished, finished films.\"\n\nAs of January 2020, \"Who's That Knocking at My Door\" holds a rating of 70% on Rotten Tomatoes from 20 reviews.\n\nMartin Scorsese's mother, Catherine, appears briefly as J.R.'s mother cooking at the beginning of the film and serving food near the end. Mrs. Scorsese would continue to appear in many of her son's films until her death in 1997. Scorsese himself appears uncredited as one of the gangsters. To this day, he still makes cameo appearances in many of his films.\n\nThe role of Sally Gaga is played by Michael Scala, the father of rapper Pizon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873113", "title": "The Immortal Bard", "text": "The Immortal Bard\n\n\"The Immortal Bard\" is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was first published in the May 1954 issue of \"Universe Science Fiction\", and has since been republished in several collections and anthologies, including \"Earth Is Room Enough\" (1957) and \"The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov\" (1986). (In \"Earth Is Room Enough\" (Panther Books Ltd. reprint 1973 edition) the title of the story is \"An Immortal Bard\" in the Contents list but \"The Immortal Bard\" on the destination page. There is a similar, but reversed variation in title with The Author's Ordeal.) Like many of his stories, it is told as a conversation, in this case between two professors at a college faculty's annual Christmas party.\n\nIt is likely that Asimov wrote this short story after seeing how literary academia viewed his own writing. His autobiography, \"In Memory Yet Green\", describes how science fiction gradually became more \"respectable\", while at the same time, professors of literary studies wrote things about SF — even about Asimov's own stories — which he completely failed to grasp. \"The Immortal Bard\" is an expression of Asimov's own deep admiration for William Shakespeare which also satirizes the interpretations built upon Shakespeare's work — such as symbolic, Freudian, and New Critical.\n\nThe physics professor, Dr. Phineas Welch, has gotten himself slightly drunk and begins speaking with Scott Robertson, a young English teacher. Welch announces, \"I can bring back the spirits of the illustrious dead.\" He goes on to explain that, via \"temporal transference\", he can bring people from the past into the present. At first, Robertson treats Welch's story as an amusing, alcohol-induced fantasy, and he begins to enjoy the conversation. Welch says that he first tried bringing eminent scientists from earlier eras—Archimedes, Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei. However, none of the scientists were adaptable enough to handle twentieth-century society; Welch realized that he needed to find an adaptable, universal mind.\n\n\"So,\" he continues, \"I tried Shakespeare.\" This startles and incenses Robertson, since it strikes \"closer to home\". Shakespeare, according to Welch, was flexible enough to understand human beings of \"every\" era, and he adjusted to the modern world much more easily. Welch reports that Shakespeare was eager to find what future generations thought of him. When Welch finds him a book of literary criticism, Shakespeare cries in exasperation, \"God ha' mercy! What cannot be racked from words in five centuries? One could wring, methinks, a flood from a damp clout!\"\n\nEventually, Welch says, he enrolled Shakespeare in a night school class on Shakespeare's plays—taught, as it happens, by Robertson. At this point, Robertson begins to become genuinely worried. He recalls a bald man with an unusual accent, and starts to doubt whether Welch's story was all alcoholic fantasy. Timidly, he asks Welch what happened, and the physicist explodes with anger. Shakespeare had been humiliated, he says, and Welch had to send him back to 1600: \"You poor simpleton, you \"flunked him!\"\"\n\nAsimov comments that he wrote the story to get back at English teachers. Additionally he says, that the story is really about himself. Not being able to answer most of the questions he's posed on his works, he realizes he would probably flunk a test on himself.\n\n"}

One can edit the appearance of graphs by changing line colors, adding patterns to rendered surfaces, adding comments, and changing the fonts and styles used to display them. Grapher is able to create animations of graphs by changing constants or rotating them in space.\n\nBefore Grapher and Mac OS X, Mac OS 9 was bundled with Pacific Tech's Graphing Calculator, a similar program to Grapher that had been included with over 20 million Macintoshes since 1994 with System 7. No versions of Mac OS X prior to Mac OS X v10.4 included a bundled graphing calculator application. On July 22, 2004, Apple bought Arizona Software's \"Curvus Pro X,\" and renamed it “Graphing Calculator”, before deciding on “Grapher”. The news was publicly announced on September 15, 2004 at AppleInsider.\n\nVersion 2.0 of Grapher was bundled with Mac OS X v10.5, and version 2.1 with Mac OS X v10.6. It was notable for being one of the few applications bundled with 10.6 to ship without 64-bit support.

Grapher is a Cocoa application which takes advantage of Mac OS X APIs. It also supports multiple equations in one graph, exporting equations to LaTeX format, and comes with several pre-made equation examples. It is one of the few sophisticated graphing programs available capable of easily exporting clean vector art for use in printed documents (although exporting 3D graphs to vector is not possible). Animation of graphs is also supported in both 2D and 3D, generating a QuickTime file.\n\nIt is also possible to use the operating system's copy-and-paste feature to copy equations from the application's visual equation editor. By doing so, Grapher functions as something of an equation editor; the user may copy images, EPS, PDF or LaTeX versions of entered equations into other applications. Any equation can be entered and copied; it is not limited to plottable equations.\n\n"}
{"id": "1873129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873129", "title": "The Warlord (wrestler)", "text": "The Warlord (wrestler)\n\nTerry Scott Szopinski (born March 28, 1962) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known by his ring name The Warlord and for his tenures in National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as one half of The Powers of Pain alongside The Barbarian.\n\nHis first national exposure was in the NWA territory Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), where Powers of Pain held the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship until they departed the company in 1988 and joined WWF, where they competed in the tag team division until the team was quietly split in 1990. Warlord then competed as a singles wrestler until departing in 1992, and had a small stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1996, where he briefly reunited with The Barbarian as The Super Assassins.\n\nIn 1986 while working out at a gym in Minnesota, Szopinski met its owner Joe Laurinaitis, better known as the professional wrestler Road Warrior Animal. After coming up with possible ring names with Sharkey and Animal, Szopinski adopted the \"Warlord\" as his ring name and sent some photos of his work to Dusty Rhodes. Soon afterwards, Rhodes hired him and he began wrestling for the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions later that year. After a brief stint in JCP, the territory's owner Jim Crockett, Jr. sent him to the Kansas City-based Central States Wrestling territory for more training. While there, he teamed with Karl Kovac and won the territory's tag team championship on June 8, 1987, in a tournament. However, he and Kovac were soon stripped of the title when Kovac was fired and Szopinski traveled to Japan for more training.\n\nIn late 1987, Szopinski returned to Jim Crockett Promotions under his Warlord name and began teaming with Ivan Koloff with Paul Jones as their manager. In 1988, he then formed a permanent tag team with the Barbarian known as \"The Powers of Pain\", the heel counterparts to the Road Warriors, while retaining Jones as their manager.\n\nWhile continuing to team with Koloff, The Powers of Pain feuded heavily with The Road Warriors, and defeated them and Dusty Rhodes for the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. To continue the feud, JCP management wanted them to do some scaffold matches against the Warriors, but this was met with opposition from Szopinski and Vailahi over fears of injury. As a result, they both left JCP and joined the World Wrestling Federation, vacating the six-man tag team title in the process.\n\nUpon their arrival in the WWF, the Powers were faces, initially managed by Tito Santana, and The Warlord began using face paint during this tenure (while in JCP, The Warlord didn't use face paint, only The Barbarian used face paint) and feuded with World Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash), who had defeated Strike Force (Santana and Rick Martel) for the title and then injured Martel (kayfabe). The Powers were introduced as mercenaries to help Martel and Santana gain revenge on Demolition for both the title loss and the injury to Martel. They were soon after managed by the Baron.\n\nAt Survivor Series, the Powers' team defeated Demolition's team in a tag team elimination match, with the Powers being the sole survivors of their team. Near the end of the match, Demolition's manager Mr. Fuji double-crossed them and after they beat him up and left, the Powers came to his aid, gaining Fuji as their manager in the process, in return for which his interference helped the Powers eliminate the last remaining opponents, the Conquistadors. Afterwards, the Powers and Fuji celebrated until Demolition returned and drove them from the ring. As a result, the Powers became villains while Demolition became fan favorites. In 1989, Szopinski entered the Royal Rumble as the twenty-first entrant, but lasted only two seconds before being eliminated by Hulk Hogan, setting the record for shortest time spent in a Royal Rumble match. The Powers of Pain teamed with Fuji in a losing effort to Demolition in a match for the World Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn March 1990, The Powers of Pain split, with Fuji selling Barbarian's contract to Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan while selling Warlord's contract to Slick. After the team's split, Warlord received an attire change, where he abandoned his Road Warrior-like reverse mohawk and face paint in favor of a shaved head and a silver metallic Cyborg-style \"Phantom of the Opera\"-like half-mask and black armor. He also brought a metal staff topped with a \"W\" with him to his matches, and used it as a weapon on occasion. He began a feud with the British Bulldog leading to a match at WrestleMania VII. He was granted a chance at the world title against Hulk Hogan on February 8, 1991, in which he was defeated. He then began a long-running series of matches with the Texas Tornado, which rarely had either man winning. However, he did manage to score a singles victory over a high profile wrestler in Jake Roberts on August 23, 1991. On April 17, 1992, Szopinski lost to Virgil in his final match for the WWF.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF for the independent circuit, Szopinski traveled to the CWA and lost to CWA Champion Rambo in the CWA Catch Cup 1992 on August 22, 1992 in Germany. He wrestled two additional times in the fall, losing to Rambo in a rematch and then falling to new champion Buffalo Peterson.\n\nIn April 1993 Szopinski traveled to another German promotion, World Wrestling Superstars and had considerable success as he dominated Butch Reed in multiple encounters. Throughout the year he appeared in multiple other promotions, including Herb Abrahm's UWF, the WWC, ECW, and WAR. In 1994 Szopinski narrowed his focused to the IWF and WAR, participating in lengthy tours with both companies. On August 26, 1994, he teamed with Bob Backlund and Scott Putski to defeat Gedo, Hiromichi Fuyuki & Jado and win the WAR Six-Man Tag Team Championship in an event held in Yokohama, Japan. They would lose the titles days later in a rematch on September 1.\n\nOn September 23, 1994 the Powers of Pain reunited for the first time in over two years to compete for the vacant UWF Tag-Team Championship at UWF Blackjack Brawl. They were defeated by The Killer Bees. Szopinski and Vailahi continued their renewed partnership in 1995, traveling to the NWC where they faced the team Aerial Assault (Bob Bradley and a young Rob Van Dam).\n\nOn October 11, 1995, they made their return to World Championship Wrestling. They were now dubbed the Super Assassins, wrestled under masks, and were managed by Colonel Robert Parker. The Super Assassins were defeated by The Nasty Boys in their first match. Both wrestlers participated in the three-ring battle royal in the main event of WCW World War 3 on November 26. On December 16 they earned their first victory, defeating The State Patrol on WCW Worldwide. Their last match was on the January 1, 1996 edition of Monday Nitro where they fell to Lex Luger and Sting, after which the team was disbanded.\n\nThe Warlord was forced to retire from wrestling due to suffering neck injuries in a car accident involving a Pizza Hut delivery van in 1996. The accident caused significant life-altering injuries, including nerve damage that left one side of his body permanently disfigured.\n\nAfter attempting a comeback in 2001, Szopinski was sidelined yet again after suffering severe leg damage in a motorcycle accident. During his recovery, he retired from wrestling and began training as a security guard and started providing his services for Relief Group International, an auto relief group. He soon extended his services into bodyguarding, and worked alongside celebrities such as 50 Cent, Thomas Jones and Kimbo Slice, who nicknamed Szopinski the \"Wall\".\n\nOn January 10, 2003, Szopinski made his first wrestling-related appearance in years as he acted as a special guest referee for Hardkore Championship Wrestling in a match between Christian York and Reckless Youth, which Youth won. On January 25, he made his official in-ring return under his Warlord name and character as he defeated Joe Gomez.\n\nAfter wrestling regularly throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, Warlord wrestled at the first WrestleReunion on January 29, 2005, where he competed in a battle royal for the IWA Heavyweight Championship. However, he was eliminated by Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, who would go on to win the match and the title.\n\nOn April 29, 2006, he defeated Chaz to win the Maximum Xtreme Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, his first singles title.\n\nIn August 2012, Chikara announced that the Warlord would be making his debut for the promotion in the following month's 2012 King of Trios tournament, where he will reunite with the Barbarian and Meng as the \"Faces of Pain\". On September 14, the team was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by Team ROH (Mike Bennett, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Two days later, on the final day of the tournament, the Barbarian and the Warlord took part in a tag team gauntlet match, from which they eliminated their old WWF rivals, Demolition, before being eliminated themselves by the 1-2-3 Kid and Marty Jannetty.\n\nSzopinski met Chris Jericho early in Jericho's career, and helped him out with food issues while they traveled together overseas and in Japan. Dave Batista cites Szopinski as his all-time favorite wrestler.\n\nIn July 2016, Szopinski was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.\n\nThe Warlord is the second enemy in the 1991 computer game, \"WWF WrestleMania\".\n\n\n"}

In most versions of the game, the player can choose between playing as the Fourth, Fifth or Seventh Doctor; in the MS-DOS and Amiga versions, the player can play as the Second, Fourth or Seventh Doctor, and in the ZX Spectrum version only the Seventh Doctor was available. A second player may play as the Doctor's companion (Ace or a UNIT soldier, although in the Spectrum version only Ace is available). K-9 also makes appearances later in the game as does Davros, creator of the Daleks in the TV series, as the final end of level boss. The game is set in London, Paris, New York, Tokyo and Skaro.\n\nThe game was released on all major formats of the time except for the Amstrad CPC, which was announced but never released. It was designed and storyboarded by 221B Software Development. Graphics were by John Gyarmati and Wayne Dalton. Nick Kimberley programmed the PC, Spectrum and (unreleased) Amstrad versions. The Amiga and Atari ST versions were programmed by Richard Turner. Jason Heggie was in charge of the Commodore 64 version. Music was by Paul Tankard. On the PC and Amiga versions, there was a secret room behind some blocks. The room gave some of the programming credits for each game, in particular the graphics and music. The credits were hidden in this way due to the BBC not wanting individual credits for the game development team to be included in the game. Perhaps surprisingly, the PC version, which had the most sophisticated graphics, and the ZX Spectrum version, the most basic version, were both coded by the same person. This was due to the similarities between Z80 and 8086 assembly language.\n\nAlternative Software released the ZX Spectrum version only due to popular demand, since by 1992 the Spectrum was no longer a commercially viable platform. \"Dalek Attack\" was released for the Spectrum in 1993, and was the last licensed Spectrum game. It differed from all the others in its first level; in all the other releases the first level involved the Doctor on a hoverboard going along the sewer. The Spectrum version had the Doctor on foot running around collecting hostages and avoiding globes. The Spectrum version also lost out on other features such as different enemies; only the Robomen, Ogrons and standard Daleks featured. The end-level guardians were also different. Before its release Spectrum owners who wrote to Alternative software pressing for a release received a letter back stating that the game was in production, and were sent a sticker depicting the game's box front emblazoned with the legend \"I've Been Exterminated!\"\n\nOther versions of the game featured special Daleks such as hovering Daleks from the TV Century 21 comics strips of the 1960s. 1960s \"movie\" Daleks also made an appearance, as did the special weapons Dalek from \"Remembrance of the Daleks\". Another special Dalek also featured, based on a sketch in an article from the \"Doctor Who Magazine\" 10th anniversary special showing how a Dalek might look when the television series came back.\n\nThe game was later re-released, first in a three pack compilation set called the Sci-Fi Collection with two other titles (Galactic Warrior Rats, Suburban Commando) for the PC. The front cover was in a \"Y\" shape with \"Dalek Attack\" in the bottom right and the instruction booklet was photocopied. This was followed in 1994/95 by another re-release, which was the same as the original except for a purple and black border added to the front and back covers.\n\n"}

He won the National League Cy Young Award in . Scott is part of a select group of pitchers that have thrown a no-hitter and struck out 300 batters in the same season.\n\nScott was selected by the Mets in the second round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut with the Mets in . By the end of the 1982 season, Scott had compiled a 14-27 record. The Mets traded him to the Astros for Danny Heep on December 11, . In 1983, Scott had a mostly successful first season with the Astros making 24 starts and going 10-6 with a 3.72 earned run average. Scott struggled in 1984 going 5-11 with a 4.68 ERA for the Astros. \n\nThe turning point in Scott's career came in , when he became a student of pitching coach Roger Craig. Craig taught Scott the split-finger fastball, a pitch he had made famous while coaching the pitchers of the 1984 World Series champion Detroit Tigers. Scott became an 18-game winner in 1985 and was rewarded with a three-year deal with the Astros, valued at $2 million. However, there were rumors that Scott's dominating performance was the result of doctoring the baseball or cutting it or \"scuffing\" it. Scott had been accused of using sandpaper by the Chicago Cubs in 1985. In August 1986, Roger Craig, then the manager of the San Francisco Giants, complained that Scott's real secret was that he scuffed the baseball. \"It's great,\" Scott said of the charges. \"Any time you have hitters coming to the plate thinking you're doing something, it takes their minds off the pitch . . . Nine times out of 10 the umpire will look at the ball and throw it right back to me.\" \n\nScott enjoyed his most successful season in 1986, when he posted an 18-10 record with a 2.22 earned run average, striking out a league-leading 306 batters. On September 25 of that season, he threw a 2-0 no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants at the Astrodome to clinch the National League West division title for the Astros. This game was voted one of the top five games played in the Astrodome after the Astros moved to Enron Field following the 1999 season. He led a strong starting rotation that included Bob Knepper, Nolan Ryan, and Jim Deshaies.\n\nScott's outstanding form continued into the postseason, when Houston faced the Eastern Division champion New York Mets in the 1986 National League Championship Series. The Astros lost the series, 4 games to 2, but both Astros victories were courtesy of Scott's overwhelming starting pitching performances in Games 1 and 4. The Mets aggressively voiced their suspicions that Scott was doctoring the baseball to the media during the series. So dominating was Scott in those two games — 0.50 ERA, 19 strikeouts, 8 hits and only one walk in 18 innings — that the Mets considered Game 6 something of a \"must win\"; a loss would have meant facing an apparently unbeatable Mike Scott in Game 7 in the Astrodome. The Mets won Game 6 in sixteen innings, averting another Scott start, to win the league pennant.\n\nIn recognition of his regular season performance, Scott was awarded the 1986 National League Cy Young Award as the league's best pitcher. Scott was also voted the NL 1986 NLCS MVP, the first time in NLCS history that a member of the losing team was so honored (a year later, the San Francisco Giants' Jeffrey Leonard would become the second consecutive NLCS MVP of the losing team).\n\nIn , Scott was the National League starter in the All-Star Game, and threw two scoreless innings. He was also the opening day starter for the Astros. He went 16-13 with a 3.23 earned run average, eight complete games and three shutouts in 247.2 innings while finishing second in the National League with 233 strikeouts. \n\nIn , Scott once more was named the Astros' opening day starter. On June 12, he was denied a second no-hitter when the Atlanta Braves' Ken Oberkfell singled to right with two outs in the ninth inning. He had a 14-8 record with a 2.92 earned run average, eight compete games and five shutouts in 218.2 innings while having 190 strikeouts. \n\nIn , Scott won 20 games (while losing 10) and finished second in NL Cy Young Award voting, behind reliever Mark Davis of the San Diego Padres. He was for the third consecutive time the opening day starter for the Astros. He had a 3.10 earned run average, nine complete games and 172 strikeouts in 229 innings pitched.\n\nInjuries began to plague him shortly thereafter. His 1990 season was his last full season. He had a 9-13 record with a 3.81 earned run average in 32 games, having four complete games, two shutouts and 121 strikeouts in 205.2 innings. He played in just two games in the 1991 season, losing both games while lasting a total of seven innings, giving up 10 earned runs and having three strikeouts. Scott retired after the season. As of the 2014 season, Mike is fourth all-time for the Astros in wins (110) and fifth in strikeouts (1318), and sixth in games started (259). his jersey #33 has been retired by the Astros.\n\n\n"}

He grew up in Carson City, Nevada. Charlie played baseball for the Carson City High Senators. After he entered major league baseball, almost all of his career was spent with the Houston Astros. With the Astros, Kerfeld became known for a quirky sense of humor. He pitched for the Houston organization between 1985 and 1990, winning a division title with the Astros in 1986. He was in the minor leagues in 1988 and 1989 before briefly returning to the major leagues with the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves in 1990. After his retirement, Kerfeld entered minor league baseball as a coach. He holds a front office position for the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nKerfeld was the Astros' first pick (5th overall) in the secondary phase of 1982 draft, and fared well his first year at Asheville, and his second at Columbus, with sub 3.00 ERAs and 30 wins. He led the 1983 Sally League in wins, complete games, and innings pitched, while finishing second in strikeouts, earning Pitcher of the Year honors. Though he struggled initially at the triple-A level, he eventually found his bearings and even earned a July 1985 call-up to the major league club at the age of 21.\n\nKerfeld made the big league roster out of spring training in 1986, and had a career year posting an 11-2 record and a 2.59 ERA as the setup man for closer Dave Smith. His unexpected performance that year was a key reason the Astros won the National League Western Division title that season. He led the National League in won-loss percentage and finished fourth in the Rookie of the Year balloting. Kerfeld capped his season by pitching four innings and giving up a run in the NLCS. He took the loss in Game 5 when Gary Carter slapped Kerfeld's twelfth-inning pitch for a single, scoring Wally Backman.\n\nKerfeld began 1987 with the Astros, but was sent down to Tucson on April 26 after 11 games after posting an 0 – 2 record and a 6.67 ERA. After being taken out of a May game in Tucson, Kerfeld flung the baseball, underhanded but forcefully, at Tucson manager Bob Didier. The manager fined Kerfeld and suspended him for two games. Tucson pitching coach expressed frustration with Kerfeld, saying, \"A lot of things have been said. A lot of things have been done. But very little sinks in.\"\n\nLater, Kerfeld walked away from the Tucson team for a day after Rocky Childress was called up to the Astros. Kerfeld thought that he should have been called up. He said that he hastily spoke to Astros general manager Dick Wagner and said things that he regretted. In mid-July, Wagner said that Kerfeld's attitude and pitching had improved and that his weight was the biggest factor keeping him from the major leagues. He went 4 – 4 at Tucson with a 4.74, and was briefly recalled to Houston before going on the DL for two months with calcium deposits in his elbow. He pitched effectively in three games in late September, and looked to be rounding back into his stellar 1986 form.\n\nKerfeld, battling elbow, neck and weight problems, struggled in the minors in 1988 and 1989. He was on the Astros' Opening Day 1990 roster, but appeared in only five games, going 0 – 2 with a horrendous 16.20 ERA. His last game for the Astros was April 19, 1990. Ten days later, Kerfeld was traded to the Atlanta Braves for outfielder Kevin Dean and pitcher Lee Johnson. He pitched 30 innings in relief for the Braves that season, but was released during the offseason. He was signed by the Detroit Tigers and pitched briefly for their AA affiliate the London Tigers in 1991, but retired following that season.\n\nA fan favorite, Kerfeld was known for his quirky sense of humor and bullpen antics. When asked in 1987 what he would do if he had only a week to live, Kerfeld replied, \"I'd get Hulk Hogan, Brian Bosworth, Charles Barkley and I'd have a four-man tag team match with the Four Horsemen.\" Pondering alternative career options after a 1988 shoulder surgery, Kerfeld said, \"Arena Football is first. Then the World Wrestling Federation. Maybe go back to college and get a brain surgery degree. Or become an assistant clubhouse man. Or go to Harry Wendelstedt's umpiring school.\"\n\nWhen Kerfeld, whose uniform number was 37, learned that Jim Deshaies had signed for US$110,000 in 1987, he asked for and received $110,037.37 plus 37 boxes of orange Jell-O. On March 1, 1987 Kerfeld declared he would buy up 3,000 tickets per game to give away to charity causes. Without a discount, which the Astros didn't discuss, the cost for the seats would total as much as $1.6 million. Unable to afford that on a $110,000 salary, Kerfeld backed down from the offer.\n\nHe is remembered for his lucky Jetsons tee shirt (which he wore under his uniform when he pitched because the Jetsons' dog was named Astro) and for occasionally donning a rubber Coneheads mask in the bullpen along with fellow relievers Larry Andersen and Dave Smith. Coming to the ballpark, he often wore such things as pink high-tops and a Rambo cammies outfit.\n\nKerfeld gained fame for giving a drunken interview live to Bill Worrell and HSE in the Astros locker room after they clinched the NL West on September 25, 1986. The display was typical of his good nature and gregarious manner. Kerfeld was seen drinking a Busch beer during the interview, and then later pouring it on Nolan Ryan while Ryan was giving an interview with Milo Hamilton. Ryan retaliated by spraying champagne in Kerfeld's face. The clip can be found on the website YouTube.\nSometime around the 1987 season Kerfeld's first name began to appear in print as \"Charley.\" There was no explanation offered for the change and it became a source of befuddlement to players and fans alike. For the rest of his career, and to the present day, his name is often seen spelled in both forms.\n\nKerfeld remained in baseball managing in the minor leagues, including a brief stint with the Abilene Prairie Dogs of the Texas–Louisiana League. He was the Western League manager of the year in 1998 and in 2001-02. In November 2006, he became a special assistant to the general manager for the Philadelphia Phillies. As of August 2013, Kerfeld is a senior advisor to the general manager for the team.\n\n, or Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Winter League)\n"}

Rikyū's apprentice Yamanoue Sōji instructs in \"Yamanoue Sōji Ki\" to give respect to your host . Ichigo () is a Buddhist term meaning \"from one's birth to death\", i.e. one's lifetime.\n\nLater, in the mid-19th century, Ii Naosuke, Tairō (chief administrator) of the Tokugawa shogunate, elaborated on the concept in \"Chanoyu Ichie Shū\":\nGreat attention should be given to a tea gathering, which we can speak of as \"one time, one meeting\" (\"ichigo, ichie\"). Even though the host and guests may see each other often socially, one day's gathering can never be repeated exactly. Viewed this way, the meeting is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime occasion. The host, accordingly, must in true sincerity take the greatest care with every aspect of the gathering and devote himself entirely to ensuring that nothing is rough. The guests, for their part, must understand that the gathering cannot occur again and, appreciating how the host has flawlessly planned it, must also participate with true sincerity. This is what is meant by \"one time, one meeting.\"\nThis passage established the \"yojijukugo\" (four-letter idiomatic) form \"ichi-go ichi-e\" () known today.\n\n\"Ichi-go ichi-e\" is linked with Zen Buddhism and concepts of transience. The term is particularly associated with the Japanese tea ceremony, and is often brushed onto scrolls which are hung in the tea room.\n\nThe term is also much repeated in budō (martial ways). It is sometimes used to admonish students who become careless or frequently stop techniques midway to \"try again,\" rather than moving on with the technique despite the mistake. In a life-or-death struggle, there is no chance to \"try again.\" Even though techniques may be attempted many times in the dojo, each should be seen as a singular and decisive event. Similarly, in noh theater, performances are only rehearsed together once, a few days before the show, rather than the many times that are typical in the West, this corresponding to the transience of a given show.\n\n"}

{"id": "1873182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873182", "title": "Gusztáv Sebes", "text": "Gusztáv Sebes\n\nGusztáv Sebes (born Gusztáv Scharenpeck; 22 January 1906, in Budapest – 30 January 1986, in Budapest) was a Hungarian footballer and coach. With the title of Deputy Minister of Sport, he coached the Hungarian team known as the \"Mighty Magyars\" in the 1950s. Among the players in the team were Ferenc Puskás, Zoltán Czibor, Sándor Kocsis, József Bozsik, and Nándor Hidegkuti. Together with Béla Guttmann and Márton Bukovi, he formed a triumvirate of radical Hungarian coaches who pioneered the 4-2-4 formation.\n\nSebes advocated what he referred to as \"socialist football\", an early version of Total Football, with every player pulling equal weight and able to play in all positions. Under Sebes, Hungary went unbeaten for 22 consecutive matches. During this run, Hungary became Olympic Champions in 1952 and Central European Champions in 1953. They also twice defeated England, 6-3 in 1953 and 7-1 in 1954, and finished as runners-up in the 1954 FIFA World Cup. Defeat in the final marked the beginning of the end for Sebes. Following this defeat, Hungary embarked on an 18-game unbeaten run that came to an end on 19 February 1956, when they lost 3-1 to Turkey. Despite the winning streak, Sebes was sacked after a 5-4 defeat against Belgium on 3 June 1956. He remained active in football throughout his life, working as an administrator and holding coaching positions at Újpesti Dózsa SC, Budapest Honvéd SE, and Diósgyőri VTK.\n\nSebes, the son of a cobbler, initially played youth team football in Hungary with, among others, Vasas SC. He then worked as a trade union organiser in both Budapest and later, Paris, where he was employed as a fitter for four years with Renault at Billancourt. Sebes also played for the factory team Club Olympique Billancourt. On returning to Hungary in the 1920s, he played for MTK Hungária FC, where his teammates included Jenő Kálmár and Pál Titkos, both of whom later worked as assistants to Sebes. Other teammates included Iuliu Baratky and Ferenc Sas. During his time at MTK, he helped the club win the Hungarian League on three occasions and the Hungarian Cup once.\n\nIn 1948, Sebes, along with Béla Mandik and Gábor Kompóti-Kléber, was part of a three-man committee that took charge of the Hungary national football team. However, by 1949, with the title of Deputy Minister of Sport, Sebes was in sole charge and was given complete control of planning for the national side. He was inspired by the Austrian \"Wunderteam\" and the Italian team that won two World Cups in the 1930s. Both teams were predominantly drawn from one or two clubs, and Sebes wanted a similar system in Hungary. In January 1949, when Hungary became a Communist state, the resulting nationalisation of football clubs gave Sebes the opportunity. The two biggest Hungarian clubs at the time were Ferencvárosi TC and MTK Hungária FC. However, while the secret police (the ÁVH) took over MTK, Ferencváros was considered unsuitable because of its right wing and nationalist traditions. Sebes turned instead to \"Kispest AC\", and the club was taken over by the Hungarian Ministry of Defence; it became the Hungarian Army team and was subsequently renamed Budapest Honvéd SE.\n\nThe \"Kispest AC\" team already included Ferenc Puskás and József Bozsik, but army conscription now enabled Honvéd to recruit Sándor Kocsis, Zoltán Czibor, and László Budai from Ferencvárosi TC; Gyula Lóránt from Vasas SC; and goalkeeper Gyula Grosics. Sebes was effectively able to use Honvéd as a training camp for the national team. Meanwhile, at MTK, coach Márton Bukovi began using the vital 4-2-4 formation, later adopted by Sebes. In particular, Bukovi, together with Péter Palotás and Nándor Hidegkuti, pioneered the crucial \"deep lying centre-forward\" position. Other MTK players, Mihály Lantos and József Zakariás, provided the \"Mighty Magyars\" with a solid defence.\n\nIt was at the 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics that Sebes and his \"Mighty Magyars\" first came to prominence. With a forward line that included Ferenc Puskás, Sándor Kocsis, and super-sub Péter Palotás, Hungary easily progressed to the final. In five games, they scored 20 goals and conceded only two. In the semifinal, they defeated defending Olympic Champions Sweden 6-0; and in the final, they beat Yugoslavia 2-0, with goals from Puskás and Zoltán Czibor. Among those who witnessed Hungary's Olympics victory was Stanley Rous, secretary-general of the English FA and future FIFA president; he subsequently approached Sebes and invited Hungary to play England at Wembley.\n\nSebes planned for the game against England meticulously. He borrowed the heavier type of balls used by the English FA so that his team could practice with them and altered his training pitch so that the dimensions matched those at Wembley. He also arranged practice matches against Hungarian club sides ordered to play in the \"English style\", and on 15 November 1953—two weeks before the England game—Hungary played Sweden's team, coached by Englishman George Raynor. He also made the decision to use Nándor Hidegkuti instead of Péter Palotás in the \"deep lying centre-forward\" role. On 19 September 1952, in a Central European International Cup game against Switzerland with Hungary down 2-0 after half an hour, he replaced Palotás with Hidegkuti. Inspired by Hidegkuti, Hungary was level at half time and eventually won, 4-2. On 17 May 1953, Hidegkuti helped Hungary clinch the Central European title when he scored in a 3-0 win against Italy at the Stadio Olimpico.\n\nIn 1953, on the way to London to play England, Sebes and the \"Mighty Magyars\" stopped in Paris and played a warm-up game against his former team (Olympique Billancourt), beating them 18-1 in front of 3,000 spectators. \nOn 25 November 1953, Hungary took on an English team that included Stanley Matthews, Stan Mortensen, Billy Wright, and Alf Ramsey, and defeated them 6-3. In a stunning display of football, Hidegkuti scored a hat trick and Ferenc Puskás scored twice. After the game, a rematch was arranged as a warm-up for the 1954 World Cup. The return took place at the Népstadion in Budapest, and Hungary put in another impressive performance, winning 7-1.\n\nHungary entered the 1954 World Cup with both confidence and an unbeaten record stretching back to 1950. They easily progressed through the group stages, with wins over South Korea and understrength Germany. Then, in the quarter-finals, Hungary won 4-2, surviving a bruising encounter (also known as the \"Battle of Berne\") with Brazil. The game finished in a brawl, and Sebes ended up with four stitches after having been struck with a broken bottle. In the semifinals, Hungary defeated reigning world champions Uruguay. The game was 2-2 in extra time until Sándor Kocsis scored twice to seal another 4-2 win. In the final, they met Germany once again; however, the competition would end in disappointment for Hungary, losing 3-2 to the Germans in the \"Miracle of Bern.\"\n\nManager\n\n\"Hungary\"\n\nPlayer\n\n\"MTK Hungária FC/Hungária FC\"\n\n\nIndividual\n\n\n"}

The book received the 1992 Edgar Award in the Best Fact Crime category.\n\nThe book was subsequently fictionalized as the NBC television drama \"\" (1993–99), on which Simon served as a writer and producer. Many of the key detectives and incidents portrayed in the book provided inspiration for the first two seasons of the show, with other elements surfacing in later seasons as well. It later also provided inspiration for the HBO television series \"The Wire\" (2002–08).\n\nDavid Simon, a reporter for \"The Baltimore Sun\", spent four years on the police beat before taking a leave of absence to write this book. He had persuaded the Baltimore Police Department to allow him access to the city's Homicide Unit for calendar year 1988, and throughout that year he shadowed one shift of detectives as they investigated cases, conducted interrogations, executed search and arrest warrants, and testified at trials. Baltimore recorded 234 murders during the year Simon spent with the Homicide Unit.\n\nA total of 567 murders occurred in the city for the years 1989 and 1990 combined, the period during which Simon wrote \"Homicide\". The book was published in 1991, during which Baltimore saw a record 353 murders. Simon said he was particularly interested in the demythification of the American detective. Although detectives are typically portrayed as noble characters who care deeply about their victims, Simon believed real detectives regarded violence as a normal aspect of their jobs.\n\n\"Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets\" provides a sympathetic but unromantic portrait of crime fighting in a major American city at the height of the late 1980s crime epidemic. The book is notable for the detailed look it gives into the professional lives of police detectives and the mix of quirky, absurd, and sometimes tragic cases they investigated.\n\nThe case of Latonya Kim Wallace, a young girl who was sexually assaulted and murdered, is perhaps the most notable case in the book. Tom Pellegrini was the primary detective on the case, which remains unsolved. The Adena Watson case in \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" was based on this case, and the travails on it of new Detective Tim Bayliss were based on Pellegrini's experiences. Simon described it as \"the spine of the book\".\n\nThe case of Geraldine Parrish, a woman who took out insurance policies on her five husbands (two of whose bodies she kept in the same house) and relatives, and then arranged for them to be murdered. One would-be victim was her three-year-old niece. The Black Widow was convicted of three murders and received concurrent life sentences.\n\nThe primary detective on the case was Donald Waltemeyer, and his experiences would involve a memorable exhumation scene, with two attempts resulting in the wrong man being dug up. The case of character of Calpurnia Church, in the original and third episodes of \"Homicide: Life on the Street\", was based on Geraldine Parrish.\n\nCassidy, a patrolman and close friend of detective sergeant Terry McLarney, was shot in the head at point blank range with a .357 Magnum handgun. Although initially expected to die or be left completely disabled by his injuries, Cassidy made a full mental recovery but was left blind and without his sense of smell or taste. A drug dealer named Butchie Frazier was eventually convicted of attempted murder in the first degree. The case inspired the character of Blind Butchie on \"The Wire\", a blind Baltimore drug dealer who was soft-spoken and not vicious (a complete contrast to the real-life Butchie Frazier).\n\nThe Cassidy story was worked into the first season of \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" and was the largest storyline for the Det. Steve Crosetti character, where a cop played by Lee Tergesen was left blinded by a shooting in the line of duty and Crosetti moved mountains to put the assailant in prison. McLarney felt a great deal of disillusionment by the way that the BPD seemed unable to understand or fully help Cassidy in the aftermath of the shooting. The jury's actions became the basis for a Season 4 storyline where Bruce Campbell played a cop whose father, a retired officer, was strangled to death by a suspect who was acquitted by a disinterested jury; a passage in Simon's book revealed that the guilty verdict against Frazier came about because two jurors who were fully convinced Frazier was guilty instead of two who insisted he was innocent and had been framed by the police were able to convince 8 jurors who flat-out didn't care either way.\n\nA young car thief fleeing officers was fatally shot in the back. Of the officers in pursuit, only one had fired a round from his weapon, and this accidental shot was found embedded in the asphalt. With no clear murder weapon and facing silence from the uniforms on the scene, detective Donald Worden was unable to close the case, making it the only unsolved police-related shooting in the Department's history. The book notes several officers, including a primary suspect, were reassigned to administrative positions.\n\nMinor friction results between Worden and his sergeant on this case. A civilian suspect was a possibility, but the exposure of this development by a reporter shut down that investigative alley, and infuriated Worden and Rick James, his partner, as they knew that information could only have come from a police officer.\n\nThis story was worked into a \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" story where Det. Frank Pembleton investigated a police-involved shooting. Unlike the real case, the fictional story being arrested and charged with the shooting.\n\nGary Tuggle, an officer seconded to the homicide unit to help with the investigation, went on to serve in the Drug Enforcement Administration. He returned to Baltimore in March 2018 to take the post of Deputy Police Commissioner, then was appointed Interim Commissioner two months later and served until March 2019.\n\nThroughout the book, Simon frequently refers to a set of 10 informal rules that apply in the majority of homicide cases, as detectives soon learn. They are as follows:\n\n\nDavid Simon joined the Baltimore Police Department as a \"police intern\" in January 1988 and spent 12 months following the homicide detectives of Lieutenant Gary D'Addario's shift. At the beginning of the year, the shift consisted of the following personnel:\n\nFahlteich and Ceruti both transferred out of the unit during the year; they were replaced by Detectives Vernon Holley and Chris Graul.\n\nSeveral of the detectives described in the book served as the basis for characters on the Baltimore-based HBO drama \"The Wire\": \n\nAdditionally, several traits of various officers can be viewed amongst the characters on the show, and a lot of similar slang is used on the show such as the words \"Dunker\", \"Redball\", and \"Stone Whodunit\" to describe the various cases. Moreover, the police department as shown on the show has the same red/black case clearance and marking criteria.\n\nFinally, a number of small anecdotes that were used in \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" worked their way into \"The Wire\":\n\nLieutenant Gary D'Addario rose to the rank of Major commanding the Northeastern District of the Baltimore Police Department. The 37-year veteran of the department was forced to retire by new Commissioner Kevin Clark in 2004, as part of Clark's unpopular turnover of veteran command staff. D'Addario had guest appearances as QRT Lieutenant Jasper in \"Homicide: Life on the Street\", as a Desk Sergeant in HBO mini-series \"The Corner\", and as a Grand Jury States Attorney on the HBO drama \"The Wire\".\n\nSergeant Jay Landsman retired from the Baltimore Police Department and joined the Baltimore County Police Department. Landsman worked as an actor playing Lieutenant Dennis Mello in HBO's \"The Wire\". The actor Delaney Williams plays a character called Sergeant Jay Landsman in the same show. Landsman's son Jay Jr. also works as a county homicide detective working out of precinct 4 in Pikesville, Maryland.\n\nDetective Donald Waltemeyer retired from the Baltimore Police Department and joined the Aberdeen Police Department. He died of cancer in 2005, aged 58, and was posthumously promoted to Detective Sergeant.\n\nDetective Sergeant Roger Nolan became the founder and longtime supervisor of the department's Cold Case Squad and retired a day before his 70th birthday in 2009.\n\nDetective Donald Worden retired from police work in 1995 but was subsequently re-hired as a civilian contractor to work with the squad.\n\nDetective Tom Pellegrini, then 49, retired from the Baltimore Police Department in 1999 after 20 years of service, only to join the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) police force in Kosovo, in October 1999. Pellegrini later worked as a private investigator with Sherwood Investigators based in Severn, Maryland.\n\nDetective Richard Fahlteich rose to the rank of Major. He retired in 2004, but answered the Police Commissioner's request to return to duty that year as commander of the Baltimore Police Department Homicide Unit. He retired in 2006, after 32 years with the Department.\n\nDetective Sergeant Terry McLarney is still in the Baltimore Police Department, now holding the rank of Major in the Homicide Section. He spent years of exile in the Western, \"where he was banished after his shift commander [not D'Addario, whom he considered a friend] politely declined an invitation to fisticuffs\". McLarney began to serve as acting commander of the Homicide Section in May 2008 and was officially named to the post that July. In June 2011, McLarney was replaced as commander.\n\nThe book details a number of slang terms used by the city's homicide detectives.\n\n\"Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets\" won the 1992 Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime book. The \"Associated Press\" called it \"a true-crime classic\". The \"Library Journal\" also highly recommended it, and \"Newsday\" described it as \"one of the most engrossing police procedural mystery books ever written\".\n\nBooks:\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

Initially unsuccessful as a writer of drama, he fared better as a novelist (he wrote a sci-fi novel, \"Le Monde Tel Qu'il Sera\") and as a researcher and writer of Breton folklore. He was posthumously awarded the Prix Lambert.\n\nHe was the son of a civil engineer and was educated at the college of Pontivy, with the intention of following his father's career by entering the Polytechnic School. However, his father died in 1823 and he matriculated as a law student at Rennes but soon devoted himself to literature.\n\nHe was by turns a bookseller's assistant and a private schoolmaster in Nantes, a journalist and a grammar school teacher in Brest and a teacher in Mulhouse. He settled in Paris in 1836. In 1848 he became professor in the school for the instruction of civil servants initiated by Hippolyte Carnot, but which was soon to be cancelled.\n\nHe began his literary career with a drama, the ', performed at the Théâtre français in 1828. This tragedy was a pronounced failure. In novel writing he did much better than for the stage, deliberately aiming at making the novel an engine of moral instruction. His first two novels ' and \"\" met with favourable receptions.\n\nSouvestre published a series of articles in 1834 on Breton culture, and then an article on Breton poetry. These were combined and published as ' (4 vols, 1835–1837), followed by ' (1844), where the folklore and natural features of his native province are worked up into story form, and in \"Un Philosophe sous les toils\", which received in 1851 an academic prize. He also wrote a number of other works—novels, dramas, essays and miscellanies.\n\nIn 1846, Souvestre published the ambitious ' [The World As It Will Be], a full-blown dystopia and science fiction novel which featured some remarkable predictions. In it, a French couple, Maurice and Marthe are taken to the year 3000 by a man named \"John Progress\" on a flying, steam-powered, Time traveling locomotive. There, they discover the existence of steam-powered subways, submarines, synthetic materials imitating real wood, marble, etc., telephone, air conditioning, giant fruits and vegetables obtained through what we would call today genetic engineering, etc. The world is one nation, the capital of which is Tahiti. Parenting has vanished, because most children are removed from their parents and taken to places where eugenics, genetic manipulation, and different forms of education give rise to somewhat human grotesques tailored for specific tasks. Corporations have enough power to influence government decisions to ensure good profit margins. The medical community manipulates people to ensure that they are seriously sick when they enter, and conducts medical experiments on animals. This is paid for by cutting costs in the food the patients receive. No sympathy or encouragement is given to the poor or disabled. China has become inactive and listless, going into a steep decline after their socio-economic structure was ruined by opium, and wars and murders occur in Persia for idiotic religious reasons. Russia seems more or less a backwater obscurity, and Germany is a jingoistic nation that permits freedom while undermining it at the same time.\n\nSouvestre died in Paris on July 5, 1854. His widow was awarded the Prix Lambert, awarded jointly by the Académie française and the Académie des Beaux-Arts, for the moral quality of his work. French sculptor and Souvestre's friend Philippe Grass made his portrait on his tomb at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nMarie Souvestre, the feminist writer and educator who was a major influence on Eleanor Roosevelt, was his daughter.\n\n\n"}

It is operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. It is currently the ninth (see List of highest astronomical observatories) highest optical telescope in the world, situated at an elevation of 4,500 meters (14,764 ft).\n\nThe Indian Astronomical Observatory stands on Mt. Saraswati, Digpa-ratsa Ri, Hanle in south-eastern Ladakh union territory of India. Accessing the observatory, located near the Chinese border, requires a ten-hour drive from Leh, the district capital of leh.\n\nIn the late 1980s a committee chaired by Prof. B. V. Sreekantan recommended that a national large optical telescope be taken up as a priority project. The search for the site of the observatory was taken up in 1992 under the leadership of Prof. Arvind Bhatnagar. The scientists from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics found the site at Hanle.\n\nThe first light was seen by the Observatory 2-metre telescope on the midnight hour between 26 September and 27 September 2000.\n\nThe satellite link between the Centre for Research and Education in Science and Technology (CREST), Bangalore and Hanle was inaugurated by the then Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah on 2 June 2001. The Observatory was dedicated to the nation on 29 August 2001.\n\nThe Hanle site is deemed to be excellent for visible, infrared and submillimeter observations throughout the year. Specifically the observation conditions yield about 255 spectroscopic nights per year, approximately 190 photometric nights per year and an annual rain plus snow precipitation of less than 10 cm. In addition, there are low ambient temperatures, low humidity, low concentration of atmospheric aerosols, low atmospheric water vapour, dark nights and low pollution.\n\nThe Observatory has two active telescopes. These are the 2.01 meter optical-infrared Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) and a High Altitude Gamma Ray Telescope (HAGAR). The HCT is remotely operated from Bangalore from the Centre for Research and Education in Science and Technology (CREST) using a dedicated satellite link.\n\nThe Himalayan Chandra Telescope is a 2.01 meters (6.5 feet) diameter optical-infrared telescope named after India-born Nobel laureate Subrahmanyam Chandrasekhar. It contains a modified Ritchey-Chretien system with a primary mirror made of ULE ceramic which is designed to withstand low temperatures it experiences. The telescope was manufactured by Electo-Optical System Technologies Inc. at Tucson, Arizona, USA. The telescope is mounted with 3 science instruments called Himalaya Faint Object Spectrograph (HFOSC), the near-IR imager and the optical CCD imager. The telescope is remotely operated via an INSAT-3B satellite link which allows operation even in sub-zero temperatures in winter.\n\nThe High Altitude Gamma Ray Telescope (HAGAR) is an atmospheric Cerenkov experiment with 7 telescopes setup in 2008. Each telescope has 7 mirrors with a total area of 4.4 square meters. The telescopes are deployed on the periphery of a circle of radius 50 meters with one telescope at the center. Each telescope has alt-azimuth mounting.\n\nThe Center for Research and Education in Science and Technology (CREST) is situated 35 km to the northeast of Bangalore near Hoskote town. The Center houses the control room for the remote operations of the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) at the Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, and the HCT data archive. The operations are controlled using a remote satellite link.\n\nThe Indian Institute of Astrophysics is collaborating with the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences of Washington University in St. Louis, US to operate two 0.5 meters Cassegrain telescopes to monitor active galactic nuclei. One of the observatories is to be established in Hanle. The facilities 180 degrees apart in longitude are together to be called the Antipodal Transient Observatory (ATO).\n\nA Himalayan Gamma Ray Observatory (HiGRO) is being set up at Hanle in collaboration with Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai. This is currently in the advanced stage of commissioning and is expected to be functional by 2018.\n\nMajor Atmospheric Cerenkov Experiment Telescope (MACE) was expected to be set up here by December 2012. The Experiment expects to have a 21-meter collector which can collect gamma rays from space. The effort to establish the facility is led by Bhaba Atomic Research Center in collaboration with Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore and Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata. The facility is estimated to cost Rs. 400 million. Once completed it will be the only such facility in the eastern hemisphere. As of June 2014 the telescope has been fabricated by the Electronics Corporation of India and is being installed at the IAO. Once installed, this Telescope will be the second largest gamma ray telescope in the world and the world's largest telescope at the highest altitude.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873263", "title": "Roman Italy", "text": "Roman Italy\n\nThe consolidation of Italy into a single entity occurred during the Roman expansion in the peninsula, when Rome formed a permanent association with most of the local tribes and cities. The strength of the Italian confederacy was a crucial factor in the rise of Rome, starting with the Punic and Macedonian wars between the 3rd and 2nd century BC. As provinces were being established throughout the Mediterranean, Italy maintained a special status which made it \"not a province, but the (ruler) of the provinces\". Such a status meant that Roman magistrates exercised the (police power) within Italy, rather than the (military power) used abroad. Italy's inhabitants had Latin Rights as well as religious and financial privileges.\n\nThe period between the end of the 2nd century BC and the 1st century BC was turbulent, beginning with the Servile Wars, continuing with the opposition of aristocratic élite to populist reformers and leading to a Social War in the middle of Italy. However, Roman citizenship was recognized to the rest of the Italics by the end of the conflict and then extended to Cisalpine Gaul when Julius Caesar became Roman Dictator. In the context of the transition from Republic to Principate, Italy swore allegiance to Octavian Augustus and was then organized in eleven regions from the Alps to the Ionian Sea.\n\nMore than two centuries of stability followed, during which Italy was referred to as the (queen of the world) and (motherland of all lands). Several emperors made notable accomplishments in this period: Claudius incorporated Britain into the Roman Empire, Vespasian subjugated the Great Revolt of Judea and reformed the financial system, Trajan conquered Dacia and defeated Parthia, and Marcus Aurelius epitomized the ideal of the philosopher king.\n\nThe crisis of the third century hit Italy particularly hard and left the eastern half of the Empire more prosperous. In 286 AD the Roman Emperor Diocletian moved the capital of the Western Roman Empire from Rome to Mediolanum. Nevertheless, the islands of Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and Malta were added to Italy by Diocletian in 292 AD, and Italian cities such as Mediolanum and Ravenna continued to serve as capitals for the West. \n\nThe Bishop of Rome gained importance during Constantine's reign and was given religious primacy with the Edict of Thessalonica under Theodosius I. Italy was invaded several times by the barbarians and fell under the control of Odoacer, when Romulus Augustus was deposed in 476 AD. In the sixth century, Italy's territory was divided between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Germanic peoples. After that, Italy remained divided until 1861, when it was reunited in the Kingdom of Italy, which became the present-day Italian Republic in 1946.\n\nFollowing the end of the Social War in 88 BC, Rome had allowed its Italian allies full rights in Roman society and granted Roman citizenship to all the Italic peoples.\n\nAfter having been for centuries the heart of the Roman Empire, from the 3rd century the government and the cultural center began to move eastward: first the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD extended Roman citizenship to all free men within the imperial boundaries. Then, Christianity became the dominant religion during Constantine's reign (306–337), raising the power of other Eastern political centres. Although not founded as a capital city in 330, Constantinople grew in importance. It finally gained the rank of eastern capital when given an urban prefect in 359 and the senators who were \"clari\" became senators of the lowest rank as \"clarissimi\".\n\nAs a result, Italy began to decline in favour of the provinces, which resulted in the division of the Empire into two administrative units in 395: the Western Roman Empire, with its capital at Mediolanum (now Milan), and the Eastern Roman Empire, with its capital at Constantinople (now Istanbul). In 402, the capital was moved to Ravenna from Milan, confirming the decline of the city of Rome (which was sacked in 410 for the first time in seven centuries).\n\nThe name \"Italia\" covered an area whose borders evolved over time. According to Strabo's \"Geographica\", before the expansion of the Roman Republic, the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto (corresponding roughly to the current region of Calabria); later the term was extended by Romans to include the Italian Peninsula up to the Rubicon, a river located between Northern and Central Italy.\n\nIn 49 BC, with the \"Lex Roscia\", Julius Caesar gave Roman citizenship to the people of the Cisalpine Gaul; while in 42 BC the hitherto existing province was abolished, thus extending Italy to the north up to the southern foot of the Alps.\n\nUnder Augustus, the peoples of today's Aosta Valley and of the western and northern Alps were subjugated (so the western border of Roman Italy was moved to the Varus river), and the Italian eastern border was brought to the Arsia in Istria. Lastly, in the late 3rd century, Italy came to also include the islands of Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia, as well as Raetia and part of Pannonia. The city of Emona (modern Ljubljana, Slovenia) was the easternmost town of Italy.\n\nAt the beginning of the Roman imperial era, Italy was a collection of territories with different political statuses. Some cities, called \"municipia\", had some independence from Rome, while others, the \"coloniae\", were founded by the Romans themselves. Around 7 BC, Augustus divided Italy into eleven \"regiones\", as reported by Pliny the Elder in his \"Naturalis Historia\":\n\n\nItaly was privileged by Augustus and his heirs, with the construction, among other public structures, of a dense network of Roman roads. The Italian economy flourished: agriculture, handicraft and industry had a sensible growth, allowing the export of goods to the other provinces. The Italian population may have grown as well: three census were ordered by Augustus, to record the number of Roman citizens throughout the empire. The surviving totals were 4,063,000 in 28 BC, 4,233,000 in 8 BC, and 4,937,000 in AD 14, but it is still debated whether these counted all citizens, all adult male citizens, or citizens \"sui iuris\". Estimates for the population of mainland Italy, including Cisalpine Gaul, at the beginning of the 1st century range from 6,000,000 according to Karl Julius Beloch in 1886, to 14,000,000 according to Elio Lo Cascio in 2009.\n\nDuring the Crisis of the Third Century the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. In 284, emperor Diocletian restored political stability. He carried out thorough administrative reforms to maintain order. He created the so-called Tetrarchy whereby the empire was ruled by two senior emperors called Augusti and two junior vice-emperors called Caesars. He decreased the size of the Roman provinces by doubling their number to reduce the power of the provincial governors. He grouped the provinces into several dioceses (Latin: diocesis) and put them under the supervision of the imperial vicarius (vice, deputy), who was the head of the diocese. During the Crisis of the Third Century the importance of Rome declined because the city was far from the troubled frontiers. Diocletian and his colleagues usually resided in four imperial seats. The Augusti, Diocletian and Maximian, who were responsible for the East and West respectively, established themselves at Nicomedia, in north-western Anatolia (closer to the Persian frontier in the east) and Milan, in northern Italy (closer to the European frontiers) respectively. The seats of the Caesars were Augusta Treverorum (on the River Rhine frontier) for Constantius Chlorus and Sirmium (on the River Danube frontier) for Galerius who also resided at Thessaloniki.\n\nUnder Diocletian Italy became the Dioecesis Italiciana. It included Raetia. It was subdivided the following provinces:\n\n\nConstantine subdivided the empire into four Praetorian prefectures. The \"Diocesis Italiciana\" became the Praetorian prefecture of Italy (\"praefectura praetoria Italiae\"), and was subdivided into two dioceses. It still included Raetia. The two dioceses and their provinces were:\n\nDiocesis Italia annonaria (Italy of the annona - its inhabitants had to provide the administration in Milan and the troops stationed in that city the annona - food, wine and timber).\n\n\n\nIn 330, Constantine inaugurated Constantinople. He established the imperial court, a Senate, financial and judicial administrations, as well as the military structures. The new city, however, did not receive an urban prefect until 359 which raised it to the status of eastern capital. After the death of Theodosius in 395 and the subsequent division of the empire Italy was part of the Western Roman Empire. As a result of Alaric's invasion in 402 the western seat was moved from Mediolanum to Ravenna. Alaric, king of Visigoths, sacked Rome itself in 410; something that hadn't happened for eight centuries. Northern Italy was attacked by Attila's Huns in 452. Rome was sacked in 455 again by the Vandals under the command of Genseric. \n\nAccording to \"Notitia Dignitatum\", one of the very few surviving documents of Roman government updated to the 420s, Roman Italy was governed by a praetorian prefect, \"Prefectus praetorio Italiae\" (who also governed the Diocese of Africa and the Diocese of Pannonia), one \"vicarius\", and one \"comes rei militaris\". The regions of Italy were governed at the end of the fourth century by eight \"consulares\" (\"Venetiae et Histriae\", \"Aemiliae\", \"Liguriae\", \"Flaminiae et Piceni annonarii\", \"Tusciae et Umbriae\", \"Piceni suburbicarii\", \"Campaniae\", and \"Siciliae\"), two \"correctores\" (\"Apuliae et Calabriae\" and \"Lucaniae et Bruttiorum\") and seven \"praesides\" (\"Alpium Cottiarum\", \"Rhaetia Prima\" and \"Secunda\", \"Samnii\", \"Valeriae\", \"Sardiniae\", and \"Corsicae\"). In the fifth century, with the Emperors controlled by their barbarian generals, the Western imperial government maintained weak control over Italy, whose coasts were periodically under attack. In 476, with the abdication of Romulus Augustulus, the Western Roman Empire had formally fallen unless one considers Julius Nepos, the legitimate emperor recognized by Constantinople as the last. He was assassinated in 480He may have been recognized by Odoacer. Italy remained under Odoacer and his Kingdom of Italy, and then under the Ostrogothic Kingdom. The Germanic successor states under Odoacer and Theodoric the Great continued to use the Roman administrative machinery, as well as being nominal subjects of the Eastern emperor at Constantinople. In 535 Roman Emperor Justinian invaded Italy which suffered twenty years of disastrous war. In August 554, Justinian issued a Pragmatic sanction which maintained most of the organization of Diocletian. The \"Prefecture of Italy\" thus survived, and came under Roman control in the course of Justinian's Gothic War.\nAs a result of the Lombard invasion in 568, the Byzantines lost most of Italy, except the territories of the Exarchate of Ravenna - a corridor from Venice to Lazio - and footholds in the south Naples and the toe and heel of the peninsula.\n\n\n"}

As of 2015, however, the Timmins transmitter has not been launched, and due to recent funding cutbacks at the CBC its launch appears unlikely. On March 30, 2015, Eternacom, the owners of the Christian radio station CJTK-FM Sudbury, received CRTC approval to add a new FM transmitter at Timmins to operate at 105.5 MHz, which is first-adjacent to the unbuilt rebroadcaster of CBBX-FM.\n\nIn long-term expansion plans that the CBC has filed with the CRTC, the station was also slated to add rebroadcasters in Hearst, Kapuskasing and North Bay, although no firm timeframe for this service expansion has been announced.\n\n"}
{"id": "1873277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873277", "title": "Residual stress", "text": "Residual stress\n\nResidual stresses are stresses that remain in a solid material after the original cause of the stresses has been removed. Residual stress may be desirable or undesirable. For example, laser peening imparts deep beneficial compressive residual stresses into metal components such as turbine engine fan blades, and it is used in toughened glass to allow for large, thin, crack- and scratch-resistant glass displays on smartphones. However, unintended residual stress in a designed structure may cause it to fail prematurely.\n\nResidual stresses can result from a variety of mechanisms including inelastic (plastic) deformations, temperature gradients (during thermal cycle) or structural changes (phase transformation). Heat from welding may cause localized expansion, which is taken up during welding by either the molten metal or the placement of parts being welded. When the finished weldment cools, some areas cool and contract more than others, leaving residual stresses. Another example occurs during semiconductor fabrication and microsystem fabrication when thin film materials with different thermal and crystalline properties are deposited sequentially under different process conditions. The stress variation through a stack of thin film materials can be very complex and can vary between compressive and tensile stresses from layer to layer.\n\nWhile uncontrolled residual stresses are undesirable, some designs rely on them. In particular, brittle materials can be toughened by including compressive residual stress, as in the case for toughened glass and pre-stressed concrete. The predominant mechanism for failure in brittle materials is brittle fracture, which begins with initial crack formation. When an external tensile stress is applied to the material, the crack tips concentrate stress, increasing the local tensile stresses experienced at the crack tips to a greater extent than the average stress on the bulk material. This causes the initial crack to enlarge quickly (propagate) as the surrounding material is overwhelmed by the stress concentration, leading to fracture.\n\nA material having compressive residual stress helps to prevent brittle fracture because the initial crack is formed under compressive (negative tensile) stress. To cause brittle fracture by crack propagation of the initial crack, the external tensile stress must overcome the compressive residual stress before the crack tips experience sufficient tensile stress to propagate.\nThe manufacture of some swords utilises a gradient in martensite formation to produce particularly hard edges (notably the katana). The difference in residual stress between the harder cutting edge and the softer back of the sword gives such swords their characteristic curve.\n\nIn toughened glass, compressive stresses are induced on the surface of the glass, balanced by tensile stresses in the body of the glass. Due to the residual compressive stress on the surface, toughened glass is more resistant to cracks, but shatter into small shards when the outer surface is broken. A demonstration of the effect is shown by Prince Rupert's Drop, a material-science novelty in which a molten glass globule is quenched in water: Because the outer surface cools and solidifies first, when the volume cools and solidifies, it \"wants\" to take up a smaller volume than the outer \"skin\" has already defined; this puts much of the volume in tension, pulling the \"skin\" in, putting the \"skin\" in compression. As a result, the solid globule is extremely tough, able to be hit with a hammer, but if its long tail is broken, the balance of forces is upset, causing the entire piece to shatter violently.\n\nIn certain types of gun barrels made with two tubes forced together, the inner tube is compressed while the outer tube stretches, preventing cracks from opening in the rifling when the gun is fired.\n\nCastings may also have large residual stresses due to uneven cooling. Residual stress is often a cause of premature failure of critical components, and was probably a factor in the collapse of the Silver Bridge in West Virginia, United States in December 1967. The eyebar links were castings which showed high levels of residual stress, which in one eyebar, encouraged crack growth. When the crack reached a critical size, it grew catastrophically, and from that moment, the whole structure started to fail in a chain reaction. Because the structure failed in less than a minute, 46 drivers and passengers in cars on the bridge at the time were killed as the suspended roadway fell into the river below.\n\nCommon methods to induce compressive residual stress are shot peening for surfaces and High frequency impact treatment for weld toes. Depth of compressive residual stress varies depending of the method. Both methods can increase lifetime of constructions significiantly. \n\nThere are some techniques which are used to create uniform residual stress in a beam. For example, the four point bend allows inserting residual stress by applying a load on a beam using two cylinders.\nThere are many techniques used to measure residual stresses, which are broadly categorised into destructive, semi-destructive and non-destructive techniques. The selection of the technique depends on the information required and the nature of the measurement specimen. Factors include the depth/penetration of the measurement (surface or through-thickness), the length scale to be measured over (macroscopic, mesoscopic or microscopic), the resolution of the information required, and also the composition geometry and location of the specimen. Additionally, some of the techniques need to be performed in specialised laboratory facilities, meaning that \"on-site\" measurements are not possible for all of the techniques.\n\nDestructive techniques result in large and irreparable structural change to the specimen, meaning that either the specimen cannot be returned to service or a mock-up or spare must be used. These techniques function using a \"strain release\" principle; cutting the measurement specimen to relax the residual stresses and then measuring the deformed shape. As these deformations are usually elastic, there is an exploitable linear relationship between the magnitude of the deformation and magnitude of the released residual stress. Destructive techniques include:\n\nSimilarly to the destructive techniques, these also function using the \"strain release\" principle. However, they remove only a small amount of material, leaving the overall integrity of the structure intact. These include:\n\nThe non-destructive techniques measure the effects of relationships between the residual stresses and their action of crystallographic properties of the measured material. Some of these work by measuring the diffraction of high frequency electromagnetic radiation through the atomic lattice spacing (which has been deformed due to the stress) relative to a stress-free sample. The Ultrasonic and Magnetic techniques exploit the acoustic and ferromagnetic properties of materials to perform relative measurements of residual stress. Non-destructive techniques include:\n\nWhen undesired residual stress is present from prior metalworking operations, the amount of residual stress may be reduced using several methods. These methods may be classified into thermal and mechanical (or nonthermal) methods. All the methods involve processing the part to be stress relieved as a whole.\n\nThe thermal method involves changing the temperature of the entire part uniformly, either through heating or cooling. When parts are heated for stress relief, the process may also be known as stress relief bake. Cooling parts for stress relief is known as cryogenic stress relief and is relatively uncommon.\n\nMost metals, when heated, experience a reduction in yield strength. If the material's yield strength is sufficiently lowered by heating, locations within the material that experienced residual stresses greater than the yield strength (in the heated state) would yield or deform. This leaves the material with residual stresses that are at most as high as the yield strength of the material in its heated state.\n\nStress relief bake should not be confused with annealing or tempering, which are heat treatments to increase ductility of a metal. Although those processes also involve heating the material to high temperatures and reduce residual stresses, they also involve a change in metallurgical properties, which may be undesired.\n\nFor certain materials such as low alloy steel, care must be taken during stress relief bake so as not to exceed the temperature at which the material achieves maximum hardness (See Tempering in alloy steels).\n\nCryogenic stress relief involves placing the material (usually steel) into a cryogenic environment such as liquid nitrogen. In this process, the material to be stress relieved will be cooled to a cryogenic temperature for a long period, then slowly brought back to room temperature.\n\nMechanical methods to relieve undesirable surface tensile stresses and replace them with beneficial compressive residual stresses include shot peening and laser peening. Each works the surface of the material with a media: shot peening typically uses a metal or glass material; laser peening uses high intensity beams of light to induce a shock wave that propagates deep into the material.\n\n\n\n"}

It broadcasts the Société Radio-Canada's Ici Radio-Canada Première network at 98.1 FM in Sudbury, Ontario. The station also serves much of Northern Ontario through a network of relay transmitters.\n\nOn July 28, 1975, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) received approval from the CRTC to operate a new french-language FM station at Sudbury, Ontario on the frequency 98.1 MHz. \n\nPrior to the station's launch in 1978, Radio-Canada programming was carried on private affiliate CFBR. The CRTC decision authorizing the launch of CBON-FM in fact encouraged, but did not direct, Radio-Canada to retain an AM frequency for its talk radio network, and to reserve CBON-FM for its music network. However, the station launched in 1978 as an affiliate of the talk network after the CBC was unable to negotiate an agreement with F. Baxter Ricard to directly acquire CFBR. Prior to CBON-FM's sign-on, CJBC Toronto simulcasted on most of the rebroadcast transmitters across northern Ontario.\n\nRadio-Canada's music network was not available in the city until the launch of CBBX-FM in 2001, although from 1984 to 1991 the CBC held an unused license to launch that station.\n\nThe station's regional morning program is \"Le matin du Nord\", weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., and its regional afternoon program is \"Jonction 11-17\", weekdays from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. On Saturday mornings, the station produces the provincewide morning program \"Enfin samedi\", hosted and produced in Sudbury with additional contributions from staff in Toronto. The provincewide programs airs on CBON and CJBC, as well as CBEF in Windsor.\n\nOn all public holidays, either \"L'heure de pointe Toronto\" from CJBC in Toronto or \"Ça parle au Nord\" is heard provincewide (except Ottawa) from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. On some holidays, \"Y'a pas deux matins pareils\" from CJBC or \"Le matin du Nord\" from CBON airs on both stations, but on some others holidays, both stations air their local shows as usual or both stations air \"Matins sans frontières\" from CBEF Windsor.\n\nOn February 28, 2017, the CBC submitted an application to convert CBON-6 1010 to 98.5 MHz. The callsign CBON-FM-6 was chosen for the new FM transmitter. The CRTC approved the CBC's application to move CBON-6 to 98.5 MHz on July 11, 2017.\n\nIn 2017, the CBC surrendered its licence for the low-power AM rebroadcaster CBON-10 1110 Matachewan.

Vale also produces manganese, ferroalloys, copper, bauxite, potash, kaolin, and cobalt, currently operating nine hydroelectricity plants, and a large network of railroads, ships, and ports used to transport its products.\n\nThe company has had two catastrophic tailings dam failures in Brazil: Mariana, in 2015, and Brumadinho, in 2019; the Brumadinho dam disaster caused the company to lose its license to operate eight tailings dams in Minas Gerais, and its stock to lose nearly 25 percent in value.\n\nAlthough the company's primary operations are in Brazil, Vale has operations in 30 countries, which are detailed below and on the company's website. \nThe company is listed on the stock exchanges of São Paulo, New York City, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Paris and Madrid.\n\nIron ore: Vale is the world's largest iron ore producer. Sales of iron ore fines and pellets represented 65% of total company revenues in 2014. In 2014, Vale sold 256 million metric tonnes of iron ore fines and 44 million metric tonnes of iron ore pellets. Vale's Mariana Hub was the 9th largest iron ore mining center in the world in 2014, with an output of 39 million metric tonnes. Vale's Serra Sull / S11D is the largest mining reserve in the world. The company's iron ore mines are primarily in Brazil.\n\nNickel: Vale is the world's largest nickel producer. Sales of nickel represented 17% of total company revenues in 2014. In 2014, Vale sold 272,000 metric tonnes of nickel.

The company owns coal mines in Australia and Mozambique.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2006, Vale invested more than $1.3 billion on the acquisition of over 361 locomotives and around 14,090 freight cars, those locomotives were primarily for iron ore transportation, but some were for regular cargo. Some of the locomotives purchased were secondhand for refurbishment but at least 55 of the locomotives acquired were new ones of the model EMD SD70M, each one costing about $2 million.\n\nAfter those investments, Vale became the owner of over 800 locomotives and more than 35,000 freight cars.\n\nVale owns the concession of three Brazilian railways: Vitória-Minas Railway (EFVM), Ferrovia Centro-Atlântica (FCA) and Carajás railroad (EFC). \n\n\nOn February 5, 2019, the state court of the Province of Minas Gerais ordered Vale to halt use of eight of its tailings dams, including the Laranjeiras dam at Brucutu.\n\n\nVale also operates port terminals in the state of Sergipe and two others in the state of Espirito Santo.\n\n\nVale has also entered the shipping business by ordering 35 Very Large Ore Carriers (VLOC) to transport iron ore between South America and Asia. These , 400,000 DWT ships are the longest and largest dry bulk carriers in the world. The first ship, \"Vale Brasil\", was delivered in March 2011.\n\nVale's energy business is focused at power production to fulfill the needs of its mining operations, as well as supplying the general Brazilian power grid.

The agreement required the company to pay a total of US$60.5 million in 2007 and US$48.1 million annually for a 30-year period and gave it total control of MBR.\n\nIn 2015, Vale announced the sale of a 36.4% interest in MBR for R$4 billion.\n\nIn 2001, Vale increased its copper mining operations by purchasing the Sossego mine in Carajas, in northern Brazil, for $48.5 million.\n\nIn 2005, Vale acquired Canico Resource, owner of a nickel mine in Brazil, after increasing its offer to $865 million.\n\nIn October 2006, Vale acquired Canadian-based nickel producer Inco, for $18.9 billion, including $17.7 billion in cash and the assumption of $1.2 billion in debt. To gain approval from Canadian authorities, Vale promised to continue investments in Canada and not layoff people for 3 years after closing.\n\nIn 2007, Vale made a major entry into coal mining by acquiring AMCI Holdings Australia for AU$835 million.\n\nIn 2010, Vale launched a public offer to acquire fertilizer and copper producer Paranapanema.\n\nIn 2010, Vale acquired a controlling interest in Fosfertil via a series of transactions.\n\nIn June 2011, Jason Chenier and Jordan Fram were killed at the 3,000 foot level of the Frood Mine near Sudbury, Ontario.\n\nIn 2011, the company sold its aluminum business to Norsk Hydro in a US$5.27 billion transaction.\n\nIn July 2012, Vale sold its ferro-manganese plants in Europe to Glencore for $160 million.\n\nIn 2014, Vale announced the sale of coal assets in Mozambique to Mitsui in a $950 million transaction.\n\nIn 2014, Vale sold its interest in Fosbrasil S.A., a manufacturer of phosphate-based products.\n\nIn 2015, the company announced that it would sell a 25% interest in gold produced from its Salobo mine, located in Brazil, to Silver Wheaton for US$900 million.\n\nIn 2015, the company entered into a letter of intent to sell bauxite assets to Norsk Hydro.\n\nOn 26 November 2015, Vale announced that it planned to reduce its budget for capital expenditures from US$8 billion in 2015 to US$6.2 billion in 2016, with further reductions to US$4–5 billion by 2018.\n\nOn 5 November 2015, the Mariana dam disaster caused 19 deaths and massive environmental contamination when a tailings dam collapsed at the Samarco mining site, co-owned by Vale and BHP Billiton. Heavy metal contamination of the Doce River caused water emergencies in many downstream cities which depend on the river for drinking water. Activities at the mine were suspended, and the companies agreed to pay compensation of R$4.4 billion (US$1.55 billion).\n\nOn 25 January 2019, the Brumadinho dam disaster occurred at the Córrego do Feijão mine in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, releasing 3 billion gallons of mine waste, in a wave of red iron ore which destroyed the mine's cafeteria, where many workers were present and lost their lives, and which flooded the town of Brumadinho. Reports varied in the wake of the disaster: \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported, on February 10, 2019, that \"the disaster killed at least 157 people\"; National Public Radio had reported that, as of February 1, 205 remained missing. 192 were rescued alive after the tailings dam collapsed. Though not as environmentally devastating as the 2015 collapse, the 2019 disaster caused more human deaths.\n\nFollowing the Córrego do Feijão disaster, a Brazilian court ordered Vale to stop disposing of tailings at eight dams.\n\nIn January 2012, Vale received the \"people's choice\" Public Eye Award as the corporation with the most \"contempt for the environment and human rights\" in the world. Vale received 25,000 votes, with the Belo Monte Dam cited as a reason.\n\nDuring the interim between the two dam disasters, of 2015 and 2019; Vale had denied owning an upstream tailings waste structure such as collapsed, causing the Brumadinho dam to burst.\n\nFollowing the 2019 disaster, BBC News reported that \"Correspondents say the alarm system the company had installed to warn residents of any risk did not go off.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873304", "title": "CJBC (AM)", "text": "CJBC (AM)\n\nCJBC is a Canadian Class A clear-channel station, which broadcasts at 860 AM in Toronto, Ontario. It is the city's affiliate of the Ici Radio-Canada Première network. CJBC's studios are located at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre, while its transmitter is located in Hornby.\n\nThe station was originally launched in 1925 as CKNC on 840 AM, owned by the Canadian National Carbon Company. In January 1927, the station moved to 690, returning to 840 a month later. The station then moved to 580 in 1928, and to 1030 in 1931.\n\nThe station was leased and then acquired by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, the forerunner of the modern Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in 1933 and became CRCY, before leaving the airwaves in 1935. The following year, it returned at 1420, as a signal booster for CRCT. The station's callsign was changed to CBY in 1938, and to CJBC in 1943.\n\nIn 1944, CJBC became the flagship of the CBC's Dominion Network. In 1948, its signal strength was boosted to 50,000 watts, up from its previous strength of 1,000 watts. As a Dominion Network affiliate, the station carried network programming in the evening, which included light entertainment fare and some American programming, and local programming during the day.\n\nCJBC began carrying some French language programming in 1962, initially in the form of a nightly, half-hour newscast. With the closure of the Dominion Network on October 1, 1962, CJBC's French schedule expanded to two hours of programming each evening. The station adopted a French-only schedule when it became a fully fledged Radio-Canada station on October 1, 1964. Federal Member of Parliament Ralph Cowan attempted to fight the changeover, arguing that since the French language had no legal status outside of Quebec, the station's conversion to French was inappropriate and illegal; however, his case was dismissed by the Ontario Supreme Court in 1965 on the grounds that Cowan did not have legal standing and could not show material harm from the format change.\n\nThe station has been carried on rebroadcasters in Belleville, Kingston and Midland-Penetanguishene since 1977, London since 1978 and Peterborough since 1980. CJBC also had rebroadcasters under the CJBC callsign that served most of northern Ontario that changed to CBON-FM programming out of Sudbury after the station signed on in 1978.\n\nCBEF in Windsor, although officially licensed as a separate station, has also been a \"de facto\" rebroadcaster of CJBC since staffing cutbacks in 2009; the station maintained a skeleton staff of just two reporters for local news breaks, while otherwise simulcasting CJBC's programming at all times. Eventually, CBEF would expand its local programming with a morning program and local news bulletins, though otherwise broadcasting a similar schedule as CJBC.\n\nSince 1993, CJBC's Toronto studios have been based at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre on Front Street. A sister station, CJBC-FM, was launched in 1992 to broadcast Radio-Canada's music network.\n\nIn 2011, following the revocation of CKLN-FM's licence, the CBC submitted an unsuccessful application to the CRTC to add a nested rebroadcaster of CJBC on 88.1 FM in Toronto with an average effective radiated power of 98 watts and a height above average terrain of 303.4 metres, in order to improve reception in areas of Toronto, due to inefficiencies of the AM signal. On September 11, 2012, the 88.1 FM frequency was awarded to Central Ontario Broadcasting, which would sign on the station as CIND-FM, \"Indie88\".\n\nThe current CJBC is unrelated to another station, owned and operated by the Jarvis Street Baptist Church from 1925 until 1933, which also used the call letters CJBC. That station went dark in 1933 after the government of Canada withdrew all religious broadcasting licenses. The CJBC call letters were subsequently acquired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's CRCY in 1943.\n\nThe station's regional morning program is \"Y'a pas deux matins pareils\", weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., and its regional afternoon program \"L'heure de pointe Toronto\", weekdays from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m., is also heard on CBEF in Windsor. On Saturday mornings, the station airs the provincewide morning program \"Grands Lacs Café\", which is hosted and produced in Sudbury with additional contributions from staff in Toronto. The provincewide programs airs on CBON and CJBC, as well as CBEF. On all public holidays, \"L'heure de pointe Toronto\" from CJBC in or \"Ça parle au Nord\" from CBON-FM in Sudbury is heard provincewide (except Ottawa) from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. On some holidays, \"Y'a pas deux matins pareils\" or \"Le matin du Nord\" from CBON airs on both stations, but on some others holidays, both stations air their local shows as usual or both stations air \"Matins sans frontières\" from CBEF Windsor.\n\n"}

{"id": "1873309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873309", "title": "Lem Billings", "text": "Lem Billings\n\nKirk LeMoyne \"Lem\" Billings (April 15, 1916 – May 28, 1981) was a close and long-time friend of President John F. Kennedy and the Kennedy family. Billings was a prep school roommate of Kennedy, an usher at his wedding and a campaigner for his successful 1960 presidential bid. Joseph Kennedy Sr. called him \"my second son,\" and he sometimes acted as escort for several of the Kennedy women. Billings served with Sargent Shriver as a trustee for the Kennedy family trusts.\n\nBillings was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on April 15, 1916, the third child of Frederic Tremaine Billings (1873–1933) and Romaine LeMoyne (1882–1970). His father was a prominent physician and a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. His mother was a \"Mayflower\" descendant and his great-grandfather Francis Julius LeMoyne was a prominent abolitionist linked to the underground railroad who helped establish what is today known as LeMoyne-Owen College. The Billings family were Episcopalians and Republicans.\n\nBillings, a 16-year-old third-year student, and Kennedy, a 15-year-old second-year student, met at Choate, an elite preparatory school, in the fall of 1933. Billings as a teenager was 6' 2\", weighed 175 pounds, and was the strongest member of the Choate crew. They became fast friends, drawn to each other by their mutual distaste for their strict school. While at Choate, they formed a club and called themselves \"The Muckers\". The Muckers would pull pranks around the school and even planned to dump horse manure in the school gym, but that fell through after the headmaster found out. Billings' first visit with the Kennedy family was for Christmas in Palm Beach in 1933, after that, he joined them for holidays, participated in family events, and was treated like a member of the family. The Depression had hurt the Billings family financially, and Lem Billings was at Choate on scholarship. Billings repeated his senior year so that he and Kennedy could graduate from Choate together in 1935.\n\nBillings and Kennedy took a summer trip through Europe in the summer of 1937. Between Munich and Nuremberg, they bought a dachshund for $7 and named him Dunker after the German word \"thank you\", one of the few words Kennedy and Billings knew. The two had to give Dunker up due to Kennedy's allergies. The trip lasted two and a half months and solidified their friendship.\n\nIn 1939, Billings graduated from Princeton where he majored in art and architecture and wrote his senior thesis on Tintoretto.\n\nIn 1941, Billings failed medical tests required by the military. In 1942, supported by a recommendation from Joseph Kennedy Sr., his friend's father, who called him \"my second son,\" he won admission to the American Ambulance Field Service, where his poor eyesight was not a disqualification. He saw action in North Africa in 1942–43. In 1944 he received a commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve and served in the South Pacific until being discharged in 1946.\n\nAfter working on Kennedy's successful campaign for Congress in 1946, Billings toured seven Latin American countries with Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1948, Billings attended Harvard Business School and earned an MBA. He later had several jobs, including selling Coca-Cola dispensers to drugstores and working at a General Shoe store. As Vice President at the Emerson Drug Company in Baltimore, he was responsible for inventing the 1950s fad drink Fizzies by adding a fruit flavor to disguise the sodium citrate taste. In 1958, he moved to the Manhattan advertising firm Lennen & Newell as an advertising executive.\n\nOn September 12, 1953, Billings was an usher at the wedding of Kennedy and Jacqueline Lee Bouvier. In 1956 he was an usher at the wedding of Kennedy's sister Jean to Stephen Edward Smith.\n\nIn 1960, on leave from his job, he worked on Kennedy's presidential campaign. He managed the campaign in the Third Congressional District in the Wisconsin primary and then served as general troubleshooter and coordinator of television in the West Virginia primary.\n\nIn 1961, Billings declined Kennedy's offer to appoint him the first head of the Peace Corps, director of a new agency to promote tourism, the U.S. Travel Service, or ambassador to Denmark. He later said: \"I realized that I did not want to work for the president — because I felt it would change our relationship.\" In September 1961, he accepted an appointment to the board of trustees of the planned National Cultural Center, which later became the Kennedy Center. The next year, Kennedy named him to a board to plan America's participation in the New York World's Fair of 1964–5. He represented the President when the alumni association unveiled Kennedy's portrait at Choate in May 1963.\n\nBillings visited the White House for most weekends during the Kennedy Administration. When a butler commented on the fact that Billings was leaving his belongings in one of the third-floor guest rooms, the First Lady replied: \"He's been my house guest since I was married.\" Sometimes he stayed for longer periods. When the First Lady was away, Billings organized White House dinner parties for the President and old friends, and when the President traveled he kept the First Lady company. One presidential aide later said that \"some people saw him so much they thought he was the Secret Service.\" Billings never had a White House pass and said: \"Jack and Jackie were so nice about this that I didn't even have to tell them whether I was coming or going.\" Historian Sally Bedell Smith compared him to Leonard Zelig, a nondescript character in Woody Allen's 1983 film who is always present in the back row at major events. He sat with the President's family at the Kennedy inauguration and walked not far behind his widow at the Kennedy funeral.\n\nThe press frequently reported on his presence at Kennedy family events, such as the arrival of the Kennedy children in Washington in February 1961. He accompanied the President to church, launched a kite for the President's daughter Caroline, and delivered pet hamsters to the Kennedy children. He joined the President's entourage for his tours of Europe in both 1961 and 1963. In 1962 he escorted two of the President's sisters, Eunice Shriver and Jean Kennedy Smith, around Europe for more than two weeks. When the Kennedys spent the weekend at Glen Ora, their Virginia estate, Jacqueline Kennedy invited Billings to join them more often than the President did. She needed Billings to keep the President company while she went horseback riding.\n\nBillings' role as \"first friend\" was assessed by many observers at the time and since. Ted Sorensen called him \"an admirer — almost a fawning admirer — of his friend.\" Arthur Schlesinger thought Billings \"used to glare at me when we occasionally encountered each other in the company of JFK, and for a time I took this rather personally. Soon I discovered that he glared with equal suspicion at anyone whose friendship with JFK postdated his own.\" Another said: \"Members of the president's staff thought of him as a 'handy old piece of furniture.'\"\n\nMost recognized that Billings and Kennedy had been friends from youth and did not question their relationship or Billings' presence. Ben Bradlee, a Kennedy friend who worked at \"Newsweek\" during the Kennedy Administration, and no friend of Billings, said \"they were childhood friends and stayed loyal to each other forever.\" Billings, he said, \"had a natural jealousy. He didn't want to share his friendship with Jack.\" Gore Vidal, who was banned from the White House after a run-in with Billings, was critical of Billings, but also thought Billings played an important role as an aide to Kennedy, who was often ill or in pain. \"He needed Lem Billings to get around — better than a trained nurse\" that would have made his political career impossible. Vidal thought Jacqueline Kennedy thought Billings \"was kind of a nothing ... but Jack needed him and she was practical.\"\n\nMany testify to Billings' wit and ability to help the President relax. He once described the Kennedy family's lack of business awareness: \"Listening to the Kennedy brothers talk about business was like hearing nuns talk about sex.\" Billings also served the President as an artistic adviser, selecting scrimshaw for display in the Oval Office and, on one European tour, quickly assembling a selection of artworks to be presented as gifts.\n\nBillings spent less time with the President in the fall of 1963. One of their friends thought \"that Jackie was trying to close Lem out.\" Billings spent the last weekend of October 1963 with the couple, the last time he saw them together. Billings saw the President for the last time when they dined at the White House with Greta Garbo on November 13, 1963, nine days before the President's assassination in Dallas.\n\nFriends from the 1970s confirmed that Billings was homosexual, but not open to discussing it. In 2006, looking back to the Kennedy Administration, Ben Bradlee said: \"I suppose it's known that Lem was gay...It impressed me that Jack had gay friends.\" At the same time, he admitted that no one ever expressed the idea aloud during Kennedy's White House years. Red Fay, a friend of the President from his World War II service, said of Billings: \"I didn't see anything overtly gay about him; I think he was neutral.\" One historian wrote that after the 1963 assassination Billings was: \"probably the saddest of the Kennedy 'widows'.\" Though newspapers often mentioned Billings' attendance at major social events, they identified him either as the escort of a member of the Kennedy family or included him in a list of Kennedy friends. Otherwise he attended without female accompaniment. Though there has never been any proof of homosexual activity between them, John F. Kennedy would often, and even when married, some believe they shared a bedroom with Billings. This idea is often debunked, since Billings had his own personal bedroom in the White House.\n\nSome historians believe that Billings expressed his sexual interest in Kennedy in writing in 1934 and that Kennedy rebuffed his advances. Kennedy knew Billings had rightly been accused of homosexual behavior by a fellow Choate student during their years there. Charles L. Bartlett, a journalist who introduced Kennedy to Jacqueline Bouvier and friend of both Billings and Kennedy, described their relationship: \"Lem was a stable presence for Jack. Lem's raison d'être was Jack Kennedy. I don't think it's true that he did not have views of his own, as some have said. He had a very independent mind. He had interests of his own that Jack didn't necessarily share. He certainly didn't have the same interest in politics and women that Jack had.\" Though Gore Vidal thought Billings was \"absolutely nobody,\" he also believed \"it was a good idea that Jack had somebody he could trust like that around him.\" He believed Billings loved Kennedy. \"Jack made a big difference in my life,\" Billings said. \"Because of him, I was never lonely. He may have been the reason I never got married.\"\n\nIn 1964, Billings was named to select a memorial to Kennedy to be placed in the Kennedy Center. In 1965, Jacqueline Kennedy invited Billings to accompany her and her children to England for the unveiling of a memorial to President Kennedy at Runnymede.\n\nHe escorted Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of the President, to a gala ballet performance in 1966 and Mrs. Robert Kennedy to the 1971 opening of the Kennedy Center.\n\nAfter the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968, Billings became depressed and started to drink in excess, an addiction that plagued him for the majority of his life. He maintained close ties to the Kennedys and their children for the rest of his life, frequently socializing with Bobby Kennedy Jr., to whom he became almost a surrogate father, and Christopher Lawford.\n\nBillings' behavior changed drastically in the late 1960s. According to Kennedy family members, such as Peter Lawford, and others, Billings began using drugs due to the influence of the Kennedy and Lawford boys. The elder Kennedys began to discourage the boys from associating with Billings because of his excessive recreational drug use (including alcohol).\n\nBillings served for many years along with Sargent Shriver as a trustee for the Kennedy family trusts, working from an office in the Pan Am Building. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis included Billings as a guest at a party marking the birthdays of her children Caroline (21st) and John Jr. (18th) in 1978.\n\nIn 1987, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin described how Billings structured her interviews with him. She had to submit questions in advance. Billings then prepared responses and read them aloud to her.\n\nOn May 28, 1981, Billings died in his sleep following a heart attack in his Manhattan apartment. His dying wish was for the young Kennedy men to carry his casket to its final resting place. When they arrived at the cemetery, it was already in place to be lowered. The young Kennedys took the casket and carried it around the gravesite before returning it to the burial plot. He is buried in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n"}

It is called the hypoexponetial distribution as it has a coefficient of variation less than one, compared to the hyper-exponential distribution which has coefficient of variation greater than one and the exponential distribution which has coefficient of variation of one.\n\nThe Erlang distribution is a series of \"k\" exponential distributions all with rate formula_1. The hypoexponential is a series of \"k\" exponential distributions each with their own rate formula_2, the rate of the formula_3 exponential distribution. If we have \"k\" independently distributed exponential random variables formula_4, then the random variable,\n\nis hypoexponentially distributed. The hypoexponential has a minimum coefficient of variation of formula_6.\n\nAs a result of the definition it is easier to consider this distribution as a special case of the phase-type distribution. The phase-type distribution is the time to absorption of a finite state Markov process. If we have a \"k+1\" state process, where the first \"k\" states are transient and the state \"k+1\" is an absorbing state, then the distribution of time from the start of the process until the absorbing state is reached is phase-type distributed. This becomes the hypoexponential if we start in the first 1 and move skip-free from state \"i\" to \"i+1\" with rate formula_2 until state \"k\" transitions with rate formula_8 to the absorbing state \"k+1\".

It took place on March 18, 2001 from the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum in Jacksonville, Florida. Greed replaced the promotion's March PPV event Uncensored which was held from 1995 to 2000. The pay-per-view event took place three days before the final episode of \"Thunder\" and eight days before the final episode of \"Monday Nitro\", and was the final WCW pay-per-view.\n\nIn 2014, all WCW pay-per-views were made available on the WWE Network.\n\nThe event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nThe main feud heading into Greed was between Scott Steiner and Diamond Dallas Page over the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. At SuperBrawl Revenge, Steiner defeated Kevin Nash in a Retirement match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship and Nash was forced to retire. On the following night's episode of \"Monday Nitro\", Steiner, alongside members of The Magnificent Seven, held a memorial service for Nash as well and listing down Superstars that Steiner defeated to retain his title. Steiner then revealed his next target to beat by revealing Kanyon out of a casket dressed as Diamond Dallas Page, with Kanyon having defeated Page at SuperBrawl Revenge the previous night. DDP then interrupted Steiner and accepted his challenge to a match at Greed with Steiner's title on the line. Later that night, DDP defeated Kanyon in a rematch before escaping through the crowd when Steiner attempted to attack him with a lead pipe.\n\nThe third match was Bam Bam Bigelow versus Shawn Stasiak (with Stacy Keibler). While Shawn cuts a promo that involves kissing Stacy and throwing photos of himself to the crowd, Bigelow heads to the ring to confront him but Shawn goes outside numerous times to avoid being attacked. After some brawling, Shawn delivers a top-rope flying crossbody on Bigelow, who would later execute a diving headbutt on him. Stacy distracts the referee while giving Shawn some hairspray to blind Bigelow, followed by a neckbreaker he uses to gain the victory.\n\nThe fourth match was Team Canada (Lance Storm and Mike Awesome) versus Hugh Morrus and Konnan. As Storm asks for the Canadian national anthem to be played that doesn't happen, Morrus rushes to the ring and brawls with them to start the match. Morrus attempts to deliver a moonsault but Storm attacks him from behind and Awesome lands a frog splash on Morrus, only for Konnan to interrupt the pin and fight with Storm on the outside. Morrus tries to deliver the moonsault again but Storm distracts him long enough for Awesome to grab him for an Awesome Bomb to win the match.\n\nThe sixth match was contested between Totally Buffed (Buff Bagwell and Lex Luger) and The Natural Born Thrillers (Sean O'Haire and Chuck Palumbo) for the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Before the match started, Totally Buffed cut a promo saying they undermined their opponents but were now prepared to beat them. After a brief stare down, O'Haire and Palumbo rushed to the ring and brawled with them, with Bagwell holding O'Haire for a Luger attack he received instead. Palumbo and O'Haire performed Jungle Kicks and Seanton Bombs on Totally Buffed, pinning them to win the match and retain their titles.\n\nThe eight match was between Booker T and Rick Steiner for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. The match began as a brawl outside the ring, with Steiner in control after throwing Booker into the crowd and back inside the ring to hit a Steiner-Line and double underhook powerbomb on him for consecutive two counts. After various rest holds, Booker gains the upper hand with a flying forearm, scissor kick and faceplant on Steiner before performing a Spinaroonie, but hits the referee with a Harlem sidekick meant for Steiner who delivers a German suplex. As Steiner climbs to the top rope, Shane Douglas appears from the crowd and clocks him from behind with his cast, and Booker executes a Book End on Steiner to win the match and the title.\n\nOn March 23, 2001, World Wrestling Federation (WWF) owner Vince McMahon purchased WCW, acquiring the company's assets including TV footage and some of the signed wrestlers’ contracts.\n\n\"Monday Nitro\" aired its final episode on March 26, 2001 from Panama City Beach, Florida. In that episode, Scott Steiner lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to Booker T, who also held the United States Heavyweight Championship at the time, making him a double champion. He would take the World Heavyweight Championship to the WWF, where it was renamed the WCW Championship with Booker T as the inaugural champion.\n\nLong time rivals Sting and Ric Flair faced each other for the last time in the main event of \"Nitro\" and the final match in WCW's history, in which Sting came out victorious after having Flair submit to the Scorpion Deathlock. After the match the two embraced, showing respect for one another.\n\nNear the end of the episode, WWF owner Vince McMahon appeared on an episode of \"Raw is War\" (which was broadcast from Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio) to address the purchase of WCW; the entire address was simulcast on \"Nitro\" in order to allow McMahon to address the wrestlers and fans of both promotions. During McMahon's gloating, his son Shane McMahon arrived at the venue for \"Nitro\" and revealed that he was the one who purchased WCW. This was part of a storyline between Vince and Shane McMahon that would lead up to the WWF's Invasion storyline. It also served to help build up their match at WrestleMania X-Seven where the two were scheduled for a street fight.\n\nWhile the WWF may have acquired most of WCW wrestlers’ contracts, some wrestlers, like Sting, would not join the WWF immediately after WCW's closure due to refusing to join the promotion or waiting out until their contract with AOL Time Warner expired.\n\nSting, despite being WCW's mainstay and face of the company, would resist joining the WWF (later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment, WWE) despite many close agreements on joining the promotion. He would eventually join WWE in 2014, 13 years after WCW's closure and debuted during the promotion's Survivor Series event while at the age of 55.\n\nDespite his contract being under WCW, Jeff Jarrett was fired by Vince McMahon upon his acquisition of WCW, having no interest in Jarrett. After WCW closed its doors, Jarrett, alongside his father Jerry Jarrett, would later find success as wrestling promoters after opening their own promotion, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. The promotion would bring a new generation of wrestlers that would later find their success in WWE while also gaining the attention of past WCW wrestlers like Sting and Scott Steiner. Seventeen years later, Jarrett would return to WWE in 2018 for induction to the company's Hall of Fame, followed by an in-ring return for the company at the following year's Royal Rumble.\n"}

It is charged with overseeing training of Army forces and the development of operational doctrine. TRADOC operates 37 schools and centers at 27 different locations. TRADOC schools conduct 1,304 courses and 108 language courses. The 1,304 courses include 516,000 seats (resident, on-site and distributed learning) for 443,231 soldiers; 36,145 other-service personnel; 8,314 international soldiers; and 28,310 civilians.\n\nThe current commanding general of TRADOC summarizes its function as an organization to design, develop, and build the Army. Thus, three major commands of the Army (TRADOC, FORSCOM, and AMC) shape its present \"men and materiel\".\n\nThe official mission statement for TRADOC states:\nU.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command develops, educates and trains Soldiers, civilians, and leaders; supports unit training; and builds and integrates a versatile mix of capabilities, formations, and equipment to strengthen the U.S. Army as America's Force of Decisive Action.\n\nTRADOC was established as a major U.S. Army command on 1 July 1973. The new command, along with the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM), was created from the Continental Army Command (CONARC) located at Fort Monroe, Virginia. That action was the major innovation in the Army's post-Vietnam reorganization, in the face of realization that CONARC's obligations and span of control were too broad for efficient focus. The new organization functionally realigned the major Army commands in the continental United States. CONARC, and Headquarters, U.S. Army Combat Developments Command (CDC), situated at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, were discontinued, with TRADOC and FORSCOM at Fort Belvoir assuming the realigned missions. TRADOC assumed the combat developments mission from CDC, took over the individual training mission formerly the responsibility of CONARC, and assumed command from CONARC of the major Army installations in the United States housing Army training center and Army branch schools. FORSCOM assumed CONARC's operational responsibility for the command and readiness of all divisions and corps in the continental U.S. and for the installations where they were based.\n\nJoined under TRADOC, the major Army missions of individual training and combat developments each had its own lineage. The individual training responsibility had belonged, during World War II, to Headquarters Army Ground Forces (AGF). In 1946 numbered army areas were established in the U.S. under AGF command. At that time, the AGF moved from Washington, D.C. to Fort Monroe. In March 1948, the AGF was replaced at Fort Monroe with the new Office, Chief of Army Field Forces (OCAFF). OCAFF, however, did not command the training establishment. That function was exercised by Headquarters, Department of the Army through the numbered armies to the corps, division, and Army Training Centers. In February 1955, HQ Continental Army Command (CONARC) replaced OCAFF, assuming its missions as well as the training missions from DA. In January, HQ CONARC was redesignated U.S. Continental Army Command. Combat developments emerged as a formal Army mission in the early 1950s, and OCAFF assumed that role in 1952. In 1955, CONARC assumed the mission. In 1962, HQ U.S. Army Combat Development Command (CDC) was established to bring the combat developments function under one major Army command.\n\n\n\n\nThe current Commanding General is GEN Paul E. Funk II. The Command Sergeant Major is currently CSM Timothy A. Guden.\n\nComparable organizations\n\n"}

Snethlage collected in Brazil from 1905 until her death. She was the director of the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi from 1914 to 1922. Several species of birds were described by her.\n\nMaria Emilie Snethlage was born in Kraatz (now part of Gransee) in the Province of Brandenburg, Prussia, and educated privately by her father Rev. Emil Snethlage, a Lutheran pastor, after the death of her mother. In 1889 she passed an examination that allowed her to teach young women at secondary school. At the age of 21 she studied French at Neuchatel and worked for a few years as a tutor in England, Ireland and Germany. She became interested in nature at an early age through the book \"Entdeckungsreisen in Feld und Flur\" by Hermann Wagner and she collected plants for a herbarium apart from sending notes on birds to Rudolf Blasius at a young age. In 1899, at the age of 30 she decided to study natural history at the University of Berlin. The conditions for her at attend university included the need to be in class five minutes before time and sit behind a folding screen. She was not to ask any questions during class and had to leave the premises only fifteen minutes after the end of the class. Snethlage was one of the pioneer women to attend university and she continued her studies in Jena and Freiburg, obtaining a doctorate in 1904, summa cum laude. Her thesis work was on insect musculature with August Weismann as thesis advisor. She then worked as a zoological assistant at the Berlin Natural History Museum before being hired by Emílio Goeldi for the natural history museum in Belém on the recommendation of Dr. A. Reichenow. Goeldi had worked since 1894 to head the Museo Paraense and when the Swiss zoologist Gottfried Hagmann (1874-1946) left the museum after disagreements with Goeldi, the vacancy was filled by Snethlage in 1905.\n\nSnethlage's work in the Brazilian Amazon took her to Acre and other remote places on collecting expeditions. She became the director of the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, after the death of botanist Jacques Hüber, between 1914 and 1922. She wrote the \"Catálogo das Aves Amazônicas\" (1914). Snethlage was granted honorary membership in the British Ornithologists' Union in 1915. In 1921 she went to the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, as \"naturalista viajante.\" She continued her studies of the Brazilian avifauna with field trips to Minas Gerais, Maranhão, Ceará, Espírito Santo, Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo state, and the Brazilian Amazon. On an expedition on the Curua, the main tributary of the Iriri in 1914 she was in a boat with her hand in the water when a piranha bit her. The cut became infected and she was forced to amputate, by herself, the middle finger of her right hand with a machete.\n\nShe died of heart failure in Porto Velho, Rondônia, and was buried at the cemetery of inocentes while on a field trip. In her last letter, written shortly before she died, Snethlage mentions meeting the English butterfly collector Margaret Fountaine.\n\nHer nephew was the ethnologist Dr. Emil Heinrich Snethlage.\n\nSnethlage's tody-tyrant, \"Hemitriccus minor\", was described as a new species by her, while the Madeira parakeet, \"Pyrrhura snethlageae\", described as new to science in 2002, was named in her honour.\n\nSnethlage is also commemorated in the common and scientific names of the Emilia's marmoset (\"Mico emiliae\"), also known as Snethlage's marmoset, and the scientific names of two species of South American reptiles: \"Atractus snethlageae\", a snake; and \"Loxopholis snethlageae\", a gymnophthalmid lizard.\n\n\nSources:\n"}

He played quarterback at Tulane and Northeast Louisiana and was taken in the third round of the 1986 NFL Draft by the Steelers.\n\nBrister played his high school football in Monroe, Louisiana, and originally enrolled at Tulane;. Bubby transferred to Northeast Louisiana (now Louisiana-Monroe) in 1982. Brister was originally drafted to play baseball in the fourth round out of high school by the Detroit Tigers. He played one season for the minor league Bristol Tigers before attending college for football.\n\nBrister began 1983 as Tulane's starting quarterback, before being replaced by Jon English. He then transferred to Northeast Louisiana.\n\nWhen Brister was selected, comparisons were almost immediately made between him and Steelers great Terry Bradshaw, who is also from Louisiana. Over the years, Pittsburgh sports writers and Steelers fans frequently made jokes about Brister's thick Southern accent and perceived lack of sophistication, traits that were similarly mocked in Bradshaw. In a similar vein, his name was often misspoken. In a 1999 \"Sports Illustrated\" article, Brister cited \"Bubba Brewster\" and \"Bobby Blister\" as common manglings.\n\nBrister spent two years as the backup to Bradshaw's immediate successor, Mark Malone, starting two games as a rookie in 1986 and appearing briefly in relief in two games in 1987. In his NFL debut in October 1986 Pittsburgh played on Monday Night Football against rival Cincinnati Bengals and Brister passed for 191 yards and scored a rushing touchdown, although the team lost, 24–22. He won a three-way competition for the Steelers' starting quarterback job with Todd Blackledge and Steve Bono.\n\nCareer highlights during his 1988–1991 run as Pittsburgh's starting QB included ranking 4th in the NFL in average yards per pass completion in 1988 and ranking 10th in the league in passer rating in 1990. Brister had five scoring passes that were 65 yards or longer in 1988, including an 89-yard touchdown to Louis Lipps vs the Philadelphia Eagles on November 13 that was the longest pass completion by a Steeler in Three Rivers Stadium history. In 1989, he set a team record with 15 consecutive pass completions in a road win over Detroit, including a 48 yarder to Lipps. Brister also set a team record in 1989 throwing 178 consecutive passes without an interception. It was 1990 that Brister established career highs for starts (16), yards passing (2,725) and touchdown passes (20). Brister missed 8 games with injuries in 1991, setting up a competition with back up Neil O'Donnell for the starting job. Pittsburgh went 5-3 when Brister played, only 2-6 with O'Donnell as a starter. Brister was the starting quarterback during Hall Of Fame Coach Chuck Noll's final post season run with the Steelers, winning the 1989 AFC Wild Card in overtime on the road against the Houston Oilers, then losing a close game to eventual AFC champion Denver Broncos. Brister led an 82-yard drive at the end of the 4th quarter to tie the Houston game and force overtime. Against Denver, he passed for 229 yards and 1 touchdown, with no turnovers.\n\nOne of Brister's famous quotes came after a 1991 game between the Houston Oilers and Pittsburgh Steelers. Pittsburgh was getting blown out, and coach Chuck Noll wanted to pull starter Neil O'Donnell and replace him with Brister to finish the hopeless game. Brister replied \"I don't mop up for anybody.\" O'Donnell was starting in place of an injured Brister. Even though Brister was not forced to enter that late-season loss against Houston, he did however supplant the struggling O'Donnell the next week, starting the team's final two games, both wins over Cincinnati and Cleveland.\n\nBrister played for the Steelers for 7 years, several of them as the regular starter at quarterback. In 1992, new Steelers head coach Bill Cowher chose backup quarterback O'Donnell over Brister, effectively ending his career as a starting player for the Steelers. Still, Brister played a significant role in the team's 1992 success. Brister won two games as a starter for an injured O'Donnell against the Indianapolis Colts and Cleveland Browns. In the Cleveland game, the Steelers needed to win to clinch home field advantage throughout the AFC Playoffs and Brister passed for 223 yards, 1 touchdown, and no interceptions, and had a string of 11 consecutive pass completions in one stretch. In two other games Brister came off the bench, relieving a struggling O'Donnell when he was hurt and led fourth-quarter comebacks over the Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions.\n\nAfter brief stops as a backup quarterback for the Eagles and New York Jets, Brister sat out the 1996 season. In his first season in Philadelphia in 1993, Brister ranked 7th in the league in passer rating and 4th in lowest interception percentage, starting 8 games with two relief appearances subbing for an injured Randall Cunningham. Highlights that season included his 27 completion, 245 yard, two touchdown performance vs. the Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys on Monday Night Football, and his 353-yard, three-touchdown performance in the final game of the regular season, again on Monday Night Football, leading the Eagles to a win over NFC West champion San Francisco. Brister's interception percentage that year was the lowest in Eagles team history for more than a decade until eclipsed by Donovan McNabb. His former teammate in Philadelphia, linebacker Bill Romanowski, had signed with the Denver Broncos and, in 1997, suggested to Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan that he take a look at Brister. Brister signed with Denver and became their number 3 quarterback for the 1997 season, backing up Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway and Jeff Lewis. Brister's only significant playing time in the 1997 season came in a week 17 game against the San Diego Chargers. Before the 1998 season, Lewis had fallen out of favor with the Broncos; thus, Brister became the primary backup quarterback. During the 1998 season, Elway was forced to sit out a number of games due to injury and Brister started those games in his place. He played well and the Broncos went undefeated in all of his starts (4-0); Brister also broke the team's (then) record for longest rushing touchdown by a quarterback and recorded a higher passer rating than Elway. However, when Elway retired in 1999, Brister was passed over for the starting spot in favor of Brian Griese, and the Broncos released him after that season. During his three seasons with the Broncos, he won two Super Bowl rings.\n\nBrister spent 2000 with the Vikings. He signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2001 but was cut before the season began. He then retired from football. He finished his career with a passing record of 1,207 completions in 2,212 attempts for 14,445 passing yards and 81 touchdowns.\n\nBrister played in three conference championship games and two Super Bowls.\n\nAfter retiring from football, Brister spent a short time as a television sports analyst for Fox Sports Rocky Mountain in Denver. In 2003, Brister became the co-host of a hunting and fishing oriented show called \"Louisiana Outdoor Adventures\" on The Outdoor Channel. In 2005, he joined the staff of Hunter's Specialties, a producer of hunting and fishing adventure videos.\n\nHe lives in Mandeville, Louisiana, with his wife and two children.\n\n"}

{"id": "1873390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873390", "title": "Pioneer Sergeant", "text": "Pioneer Sergeant\n\nA Pioneer Sergeant is a position in the British Army and several army units of the Commonwealth. Although a Pioneer Sergeant holds the rank of Sergeant in the army, the Pioneer Sergeant title itself is a regimental appointment rather than an official military rank. Pioneer Sergeants are found only in line infantry regiments and regiments of the Foot Guards, and are normally responsible for carpentry, joinery and related work. Since the Falklands conflict of 1982, most Line Infantry Regiments have re-introduced the establishment of one Assault Pioneer Platoon, commanded by the Assault Pioneer Sergeant as part of Headquarters Company, or Support Company. The modern Pioneers are fully trained in Mine warfare, Field Defences, including Obstacles, Explosives, and Demolitions, Watermanship, Water Supply, and General Engineering tasks. They are trained by the Royal Engineers to perform these works, and a series of qualifications are awarded to successful candidates. Upon successfully completing the Assault Pioneer Class one qualification, the soldier, of any rank, is allowed to wear the cross axes to show his trade status. The modern Pioneer Sergeant is normally responsible directly to Battalion Headquarters as their Combat Engineering adviser, in conjunction with the Assault Pioneer Warrant Officer.\n\nThe tradition of the pioneer sergeant began in the eighteenth century, when each British infantry company had a pioneer who marched at the head of the regiment. The pioneer wore a “stout” apron and carried an axe, ostensibly to clear a path for all who followed. The apron served to protect the pioneer sergeant's uniform whilst performing his duties. A tradition, dating perhaps from the early nineteenth century and possibly copied from the French, is that of infantry pioneers wearing full beards. This practice may have developed from the need for these men to perform duty as smiths, and so sported beards to protect the face. A general order of 1856 allowed for one pioneer per company in each regiment. The tools carried by the pioneers included a sawback sword, pickaxe, billhooks, shovels, and axes. In the modern era, the Pioneer Sergeant carries an axe on parade instead of a rifle and is the only soldier in the army who is allowed to wear a full beard, in deference to the ancient tradition. A Pioneer Sergeant can be identified by an embroidered badge of two crossed axes sewn above the Sergeant's rank chevrons on his sleeve.\n\nThe pattern of dress within the British Army is dependent both on the regiment and the date. For example, the portrait of the Lance Sergeant above has elements distinctive of the Coldstream Guards, such as the cuff design the buttons down the tunic front clearly showing the two button spacing pattern that is a regimental distinction of the Coldstream Guards. The distinctions of the Pioneer Sergeant uniform consist of the badge of rank worn on the right arm consisting of three white chevrons, with crossed axes, and a small rose badge above. In the case of a Lance Sergeant, strips were white instead of gold as would be worn by a sergeant. A sergeant would also have worn a sash.\n\nIn Australia, the tradition began in 1965 when Governor-General Lord De L’Isle presented the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (4RAR), with its Colours. On this occasion he suggested that the Battalion’s Pioneer Sergeant should wear a beard and carry an axe, as is the custom in the British Army. From 1973 to 1995 the 4th Battalion was linked with the 2nd Battalion (2RAR), and the tradition continued within the amalgamated Battalion (2/4RAR). In the early years of the twenty-first century 4RAR became a commando unit and removed the position of pioneer sergeant from its establishment, but the relevant standing orders allow for the Battalion to reinstate the position at a later date. In 2007 it was formally established that 2RAR could also have the bearded pioneer sergeant, making both 2 and 4RAR the only units within the Australian Army officially authorised to have bearded troops. On being re-posted the outgoing pioneer sergeant has his beard removed by the unit’s commanding officer in front of the entire battalion.\n\n"}

Woodley\n\nFabian Strachan Woodley, MC (19 July 1888 – 8 August 1957) was a British newspaperman, a soldier in the Great War, a schoolmaster, and a poet.\n\nFabian Strachan Woodley was born on 19 July 1888, in Redland, Bristol, the son of William Augustus Woodley jnr. (1855-1933), a solicitor and part-proprietor of the Somerset County Gazette, and Ada Constance Woodley, nee Strachan (d. 29 December 1920); he had one younger brother, Seymour Woodley. His father remarried following the death of his mother in 1920.\n\nWoodley’s paternal grandfather was William Augustus Woodley (1817-1891), proprietor of the Somerset County Gazette from 1843. His great-grandfather, Rev. George Woodley (bap. 1786, d. 1846), was also a poet.\n\nWoodley was educated at Cheltenham College (1903–07, Southwood House) and University College, Oxford (BA, 1911). During his time at Cheltenham, he was a member of the Clifton Rugby Club; at Oxford, he was captain of his college rugby team.\n\nWoodley’s family were members of the Church of England. However, he was married in a Catholic church (1917), and he left money in his will to the administrator of a Catholic church, for the good of the poor of the parish (1957); it is therefore possible that Woodley converted to Catholicism in early life.\n\nWoodley married Ida Leonora Lees on 20 October 1917 at the Pro-Cathedral of the Holy Apostles, Clifton, whilst serving with the Royal Munster Fusiliers. His wife was granted a decree of nullity of marriage on 15 June 1922, on the grounds of ‘the inability of her husband to consummate the marriage’. Subsequently Ida Lees married Major Henry Aplin, DSO, TD, on 6 August 1924. Major Alpin had also served with the Royal Munster Fusiliers. He died suddenly on 9 July 1928.\n\nAfter university, Woodley appeared set for a career in newspapers, joining the staff of the Bristol Times and Mirror, and then moving to a London paper.\n\nWoodley served with distinction in World War I. In September 1914 he was appointed to a temporary commission in the New Army (often referred to as Kitchener's Army) and posted to the 8th Service Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers. He was promoted to Lieutenant in September 1915. He was appointed acting Captain on several occasions, 'whilst commanding Companies'.\n\nWoodley was presented with three Divisional Parchment Certificates for gallantry in action and was awarded the Military Cross in October 1916: ‘For conspicuous gallantry during operations. By his skill and determination he beat off three counter-attacks of the enemy, who were endeavouring to reach his trench. Four days later he led his men in two attacks with great pluck’. When recommending him for a permanent commission in August, 1918, his Commanding Officer wrote: \"This officer has served continuously in France for a period of two years and 8 months, and has commanded a Company both in and out of the line, for 2½ years”. \"The Gloucestershire Echo\" of Wednesday, 22 May 1918 reported Woodley had been wounded.\n\nWoodley’s medals (Military Cross, 1914-15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal) were auctioned by Dix Noonan Webb Ltd in May 2017, realising £3,400.\n\nAfter the war, Woodley obtained a Diploma for Journalism (1920, presumably from London University), and worked with his father on the staff of the Somerset County Gazette, at Taunton.\n\nWoodley then taught English at several schools, including Wrekin College, and served with the Officers Training Corps; he retired as a teacher at the Peter Symonds School, Winchester (a boys' grammar school), were he had taught for many years.\n\nWoodley was a director of the Somerset County Gazette group of newspapers, founded by his grandfather, William Augustus Woodley senior.\n\nWoodley’s only book of poetry, \"A Crown of Friendship\", was published in 1921 by the family publishing and printing company, Woodley, Williams & Dunsford Ltd of Taunton. The book was 62 pages long and sold for 2s 6d. It contained 35 poems; eight of the poems were written during the war; two of the poems commemorate his mother, who had died the year before.\n\nThe subject matter of some of the poems has caused Woodley to be categorised as a Uranian poet by some later critics. Considered more broadly, Woodley is a Georgian poet, using the term as a description of a poetic style (characterised by romanticism, sentimentality and hedonism), rather than in its strict sense.\n\n\"A Crown of Friendship\" was reviewed in several newspapers in the south-west of England, but it does not appear to have been noticed nationally. The reviews were generally favourable, but only hinted at the ‘uranian’ nature of some of the poems. \"The Cheltenham Chronicle\" observed ‘There is a generous note running throughout—the love and loyalty of a young and ardent soul for his friends—schoolmates, college mates, comrades in the Great War’. \"The Exeter and Plymouth Gazette\" thought that ‘In some of the poems the Greek spirit is dominant, in others that of Faerie, and the poet loves Nature, the Great Mother’. The review in the \"Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette\" included a summary of Woodley’s life up to 1921.\n\n\"The Taunton Courier, and Western Advertiser\" reported that ‘Mr. Fabian Strachan Woodley, of Abbey Hill Hotel, Winchester, …. who died on August 8 last [1957], left £30,445 14s 5d gross, £30,340 11s 2d net value (duty paid £5,753). He left £500 to the administrator of St. Peter's Church, Jewry-street, Winchester, for the good of the poor of the parish.\n\n"}
{"id": "1873402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873402", "title": "CBME-FM", "text": "CBME-FM\n\nCBME-FM is an English-language Canadian radio station located in Montreal, Quebec.\n\nOwned and operated by the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, it broadcasts on 88.5 MHz using a directional antenna with an average effective radiated power of 11,510 watts and a peak effective radiated power of 25,000 watts (class B) from a transmitter atop Mount Royal.\n\nThe station has a commercial-free news/talk format and is part of the CBC Radio One network which operates across Canada. Like all CBC Radio One stations, but unlike most FM stations, it broadcasts in mono. Some local shows and newscasts produced at CBME-FM are also heard on a chain of stations across Quebec.\n\nIts studios and offices, along with those of sister stations CBM-FM, CBF-FM and CBFX-FM are located at Maison Radio-Canada at 1400 René Lévesque Boulevard East. Master control is at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto.\n\nThe station was launched in 1933 on 1050 AM and was originally known as CRCM, operated by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission. When ownership was transferred to the CBC in 1937, the station call sign became CBM and the frequency was changed to 960. On March 29, 1941, like most radio stations in North America, CBM moved to 940. Originally 5,000 watts, CBM's power was increased to 50,000 watts, the maximum power permitted by the CRTC for AM stations.\n\nPrior to 1978, CBM broadcast from a transmitter site near Marieville. In 1978 the CBC consolidated its two AM transmitters for Montreal at a site in Brossard, on the south shore of Montreal.\n\nThe AM transmitter allowed CBM to be heard across most of the eastern half of North America at night, including much of Eastern Canada. However, it was difficult to hear in some parts of Montreal during the day. To solve the problem, CBM got permission to move to 88.5 FM on July 4, 1997. The FM transmitter went on the air in 1998, and the AM transmitter was shut down in May 1999, four months after French-language sister station CBF, which got permission to move to FM at the same time and which shared CBM's transmitter site in Brossard, shut down its own AM transmitter on 690 kHz. The 940 outlet is a Class A clear-channel station which is nulled slightly in the direction of Mexico City to protect the other Class A station on 940, XEQ-AM. There are plans to return it to service, offering French-language commercial programming.\n\nThe call sign change to CBME-FM occurred in order to distinguish the station from sister station CBM-FM.\n\nThe station's local programs are \"Daybreak\" (hosted by Mike Finnerty) in the morning and \"Homerun\" (hosted by Sue Smith) in the afternoon. The station also produces the Quebec edition of \"Radio Noon\", which airs on all Radio One transmitters throughout the province.\n\nThe station also broadcasts \"All in a Weekend\" on Saturday and Sunday mornings, and \"Cinq à Six\" on Saturdays.\n\nCBM once operated a large network of repeaters across the eastern two-thirds of Quebec. However, most of those repeaters were transferred to the license of CBVE-FM in Quebec City when it became a separate station in 1994.\n\nBecause of deficiencies with the main FM signal which did not exist when the station was on AM, CBME-FM added FM rebroadcasting transmitters with directional antennas in the western part of Montreal (98 watts, from the corner of Cavendish and Sherbrooke Streets in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce) and in Cowansville (2,700 watts).\n\nThe call sign CBME was formerly used for a low-power AM repeater in La Tuque which changed to CBVE-1.\n\n"}

To date, 1982 remains as their most active year, with 32 attacks; despite having mostly targeted tourist developments, it has also assassinated a number of French police personnel. In 1984, they attacked the Biarritz airport before the arrival of the French president François Mitterrand, who was accused by IK of \"not respecting the Basque culture and national rights\". \n\nDespite sharing the same goals and methods, it held an uneasy relation with ETA, a more powerful organization based in the Southern Basque Country, mostly because ETA has used the Northern Basque Country as a hideout and did not want to provoke the French Government in this regard.\n\nIn 1998 it declared a unilateral truce, which broke when in 2000 it attacked a police station in Lecumberry and a tourism site in Bayonne.

{"id": "1873413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873413", "title": "Annie Wilkes", "text": "Annie Wilkes\n\nAnne Marie Wilkes Dugan is the main antagonist in the 1987 novel \"Misery\", by Stephen King. In the 1990 film adaptation of the novel, Wilkes was portrayed by Kathy Bates, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal.\n\nA nurse by training, she has become one of the stereotypes of the nurse as a torturer and Angel of mercy.\n\nThe novel provides Wilkes' backstory, stating that she was born in Bakersfield, California, on April 1, 1943, and graduated from the University of Southern California's nursing school with honors in 1966. After several years of working in hospitals across the country, she settled in a remote portion of Colorado's Western Slope.\n\nIn both the book and movie, Wilkes rescues protagonist Paul Sheldon after he breaks both of his legs in a car accident, and takes him to her home to convalesce. She fawns over Sheldon, a writer of romance novels starring her favorite literary character, Misery Chastain; she professes to be his \"number one fan\" and says that she loves him. She also implies that she has visited the hotel where Sheldon finishes his novels as he was staying there. These statements, and the fact that she is not in a hurry to take him to a hospital, make Sheldon uneasy. He has studied psychological disorders as part of his research for the \"Misery\" series, and suspects early on that Wilkes is mentally unstable.\n\nWilkes is furious when she discovers Sheldon killed off Misery at the end of his latest novel. She tells him she has not called a hospital or told anybody about him and makes a veiled threat on his life. She holds him captive in her home and subjects him to a series of physical and psychological tortures. She also forces him to burn the only copy of a novel he felt would put him back on track as a mainstream author, and then makes him write a new novel bringing Misery back to life. Sheldon writes the book as Wilkes wants, but bridles at her treatment of him and manages to sneak out of his room several times while she's away.\n\nOn one of his trips out of his room, Sheldon finds Wilkes' old scrapbook and learns from the newspaper clippings inside that she is a serial killer whose spree dates back to her childhood in Bakersfield. Among her victims were a neighboring family, her own father, her college roommate, and a hitchhiker with whom she had a brief fling. Sheldon also learns that she killed several patients at other hospitals where she worked. However, while serving as head maternity nurse at a hospital in Boulder, eleven infants in her care died under mysterious circumstances. She was tried for their deaths, but acquitted due to lack of evidence. Sheldon also finds that Wilkes was formerly married to a physical therapist named Ralph Dugan, who later divorced her, citing \"mental cruelty\". The last picture is an article about Sheldon's own disappearance, leading him to fear that he is Wilkes' next victim.\n\nSheldon doesn't know it, but Wilkes has known all along that he has been sneaking around her house. This sets off one of the film's most infamous scenes, in which she breaks his ankles with a sledgehammer to stop him from escaping. In the book, she chops off his foot with an axe and cauterizes it with a blowtorch and later cuts off one of his thumbs with an electric knife when he complains about a missing letter on his typewriter (this never happens in the film).\n\nIn the book, Wilkes brutally murders a Colorado state trooper who sees Sheldon in her house by stabbing him with a wooden cross and running him over with a lawnmower. In the film, the local sheriff comes to Wilkes' farm to investigate Sheldon's disappearance. Wilkes drugs Sheldon and hides him in her basement before subsequently killing the officer by shooting him in the back with a double-barreled shotgun when he hears Sheldon's cries for help.\n\nWilkes then says they should \"celebrate\" the new novel in a murder–suicide. Sheldon pretends to go along with it, telling her he needs a bottle of Dom Pérignon champagne and a cigarette, as per his usual practice after finishing a book. He soaks the manuscript with lighter fluid he picked up in the basement and sets it ablaze. While Wilkes tries to put the fire out, Sheldon overpowers her by cracking her over the head with his typewriter and choking her. In the film, he chokes her with pages of the burnt novel. In the book, he chokes her with blank pages which she believes to be the book; the real novel is hidden from sight and was later published.\n\nShe ultimately dies of a fractured skull; Sheldon is then rescued by police. In the book, she fractures her skull when she slips and falls against the mantle of the guest room bed. When the police go in to search the bedroom where Wilkes is believed to have died, they find it empty. It is later revealed that, despite being mortally wounded, she managed to escape the bedroom and died in her barn with her hands on a chainsaw, which she presumably intended to use on Sheldon. In the movie, Sheldon trips her up so she falls and cracks her head on the corner of the typewriter she forced him to use; she recovers from this and attacks him, but he kills her by ramming a metal statue of her pet sow pig – named Misery after his stories – into her head.\n\nKing characterizes Annie Wilkes as a cunning, brutal and devious woman who hides her malice behind a cheery façade. Both the novel and the film portray her as extremely paranoid, and also suggest that she may have bipolar disorder. In the novel, she has day-long bouts with depression, during which she is seen maiming herself; Sheldon also finds evidence that she gorges herself on vast quantities of food. She has an unhealthy obsession with romance novels, particularly Sheldon's \"Misery\" series.\nShe abhors profanity, to the point that she will fly into fits of rage if it is used in front of her. She instead expresses anger with childishly strange words and phrases like \"cockadoodie\", \"mister man\", \"dirty bird\", \"dirty birdy\", \"oogie\", \"fiddely-foof\" and \"rooty-patooties\". In the novel, however, she lets more conventional profanities slip on occasion. She has violent tantrums over insignificant matters. For instance, when Sheldon complains that the packet of Eaton's Corrasable Bond paper she bought for him is smudge-prone, she smashes his still-healing knee; in the book, when he mentions that her typewriter is missing a key, she cuts off his thumb.\n\nKing has noted that Wilkes \"may seem psychopathic to us, but it's important to remember that she seems perfectly sane and reasonable to herself – heroic, in fact, a beleaguered woman trying to survive in a hostile world filled with cockadoodie brats\".\n\nIn a special feature on the collectors' edition DVD, forensic psychologist Reid Meloy said that Wilkes' personality (as portrayed by Kathy Bates) is a virtual catalog of mental illness. According to Meloy, Wilkes has bipolar disorder, a severe borderline personality disorder with schizoid, schizotypal and obsessive–compulsive features, and sadomasochism. He also believes her profile is typical of people who stalk celebrities.\n\nIn his commentary on the film available on the DVD, director Rob Reiner notes that Wilkes is loosely based on that of Genene Jones, a nurse who is believed to have killed as many as 50 children who were in her care over a two-year period.\n\nThe fictional version of King that appears in \"\" (2004) discusses Annie Wilkes.\n\nAnnie Wilkes is mentioned in Kim Newman's novella, \"The Other Side of Midnight\". In the novel, which is set in Newman's alternate history crossover \"Anno Dracula\" series, Wilkes is the murderer of John Lennon. When she is arrested for the crime, she tells the press that she loved Lennon, but that he had to die for splitting up the Beatles.\n\nKathy Bates reprises her role as Annie Wilkes in a 2008 commercial for DirecTV, with the setting being the infamous scene where she cripples Paul Sheldon.\n\nThere is also Tamil film \"Julie Ganapathi\" from 2003 directed by Balu Mahendra, based loosely on the novel, and South Indian actress Saritha playing film's title character Julie Ganapathi, which is based on the Annie Wilkes character.\n\nThe novel was later adapted into a play, which went on to Broadway from November 2015 to February 2016. Annie was played by Laurie Metcalf. At the 70th Annual Tony Awards, Metcalf was nominated for Best Actress in a Play for her performance.\n\nThere are also two Finnish play adaptations called \"Piina\" based on the 1990 film adaptation's screenplay by William Goldman. In one of them, Annie Wilkes is played by Mari Turunen and in another, by Henna Haverinen.\n\nA version of a young Annie Wilkes appears in the TV series \"Castle Rock\", and is portrayed by Lizzy Caplan.\n\nThe American Film Institute included Wilkes (as played by Bates) in their \"100 Heroes and Villains\" list, ranking her as the 17th most iconic villain (and sixth most iconic villainess) in film history.\n\n"}

Its studios and master control are located at Maison Radio-Canada in Montreal.\n\nThe station has a non-commercial news/talk format and is the flagship of the Ici Radio-Canada Première network which operates across Canada. Like all Première stations, but unlike most FM stations, it broadcasts in mono. In the summer of 2018, the Montreal 95.1 station started to broadcast in FM multiplex. \n\nCBF went on the air on December 11, 1937, as the CBC launched its French-language network, known as Radio-Canada. CBF operated on 910 using 50,000 watts full-time with an omnidirectional antenna as a clear channel Class I-A station. The transmitter was located in Contrecoeur.\n\nThe station moved to 690 on March 29, 1941, as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. In 1978 the CBC consolidated its two Montréal AM broadcast transmitters and the station moved to a new transmitter site shared with CBM in Brossard (Now known as CBME-FM on 88.5 FM).\n\nCBF started to broadcast from Maison Radio-Canada in November 1971. Commercial advertising on the station was eliminated in 1974 except for Montreal Canadiens hockey games. (CBF was the Canadiens' radio flagship since its opening in 1937 and would remain so until 1997.)\n\nCBF applied to move to FM and was authorized to do so by the CRTC on July 4, 1997. The AM signal covered much of the western half of Quebec, and was strong enough to be heard in Ottawa and the National Capital Region, as well as parts of New York State and Vermont. Indeed, until CBOF signed on in 1964, CBF doubled as the Radio-Canada outlet for Ottawa as well. Its nighttime signal covered most of the eastern half of North America, including much of Eastern Canada. However, radio frequency interference rendered it almost unlistenable in parts of Montreal during the day, which prompted the decision to move the station to the FM dial.\n\nThe FM transmitter was put on the air ahead of schedule on January 22, 1998, and initially had special programming targeting people affected by the 1998 Ice Storm (i.e., people without electricity). The AM signal was shut down on January 21, 1999. (English-language sister station CBM got permission to move to FM and started FM operations at the same time, retaining its AM signal until May 14, 1999.) CBF became CBF-FM when it moved to the FM dial. The existing station with the CBF-FM callsign at 100.7 MHz was renamed CBFX-FM. The station's old home at 690 was taken over by CKVL, which moved from 850 under the new callsign CINF. That station closed down in 2010, and the frequency remained dark until 2012, when English-language sports station CKGM moved there.\n\nTo improve reception, CBF was authorized to increase its power from 17,030 watts to 100,000 watts on June 2, 2000. The power increase was implemented in mid-2001.\n\nIn recent years the popularity of the station has increased significantly. The station is now usually one of the top five stations in Bureau of Broadcast Measurement ratings (using shares), after decades of being an also-ran.\n\nOn September 27, 2018, CBF-FM began broadcasting in HD Radio for compatible receivers, with its second digital radio subchannel offering ICI Musique Classique, a digital-only music feed.\n\nOn October 17, 1986 the CRTC approved the CBC's application to change CBF-3's frequency from 1400 to 650 kHz. (Now part of CHLM-FM).\n\nCBF-FM-10 in Sherbrooke and CBF-FM-8 in Trois-Rivières were once full satellites of CBF, but began airing some local programming in 1998. They have both been licensed as full-fledged stations since 2000, despite still having rebroadcaster-like call signs. Both stations have their own local programs and news bulletins; otherwise, their schedules are similar to CBF.\n\nOn July 5, 2010, the CBC applied to decrease the effective radiated power of CBF-20, and also on the same date, the CBC also applied to broadcast, on the rebroadcasting transmitters CBF-16, CBF-17 and CBF-18, the programming of CBF-8 instead of the programming of CBF. All technical parameters of the rebroadcasters would remain unchanged.\n\nOn July 29, 2010, the CRTC approved the application to transfer transmitters CBF-1, CBF-3 and CBF-4 from CBF to CHLM-FM Rouyn-Noranda.\n\nOn October 30, 2012, the CBC received approval to change the source of programming from CBF to CBFG-FM Chisasibi on the following repeaters: CBFA-1 Manawan, CBFA-2 Obedjiwan, CBFW Wemindji, CBFM Mistissini, CBFA-3 Wemotaci, CBFH Waskaganish and CBFV Waswanipi.\n\nAs of 2015, the entirety of CBF's schedule is broadcast live throughout North America via Sirius XM Canada on channel 170. In effect, CBF is one of four terrestrial stations in North America to be broadcast on Sirius XM, and the only one broadcast using the same feed as the local station (KIIS-FM Los Angeles; WBBR New York City; & WHTZ Newark, New Jersey; are the others, though any local commercials are switched to national commercials and promos).\n\n"}

It is the flagship station of the Ici Musique Network and broadcasts in French.\n\nOwned and operated by the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (French: Société Radio-Canada), CBFX-FM is a Class C1 station. It transmits from the Mount Royal candelabra tower with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts. Its studios and offices, along with those of Ici Radio-Canada Première sister station CBF-FM, are located at Maison Radio-Canada on René Lévesque Boulevard.\n\nOn March 13, 1946, the station began experimental broadcasts as VE9CB on 98.1 MHz. It received a full license on March 5, 1948, as CBF-FM, broadcasting at 95.1 MHz. For most of its early years, it simulcast co-owned CBF. Occasionally in the 1960s and 70s, it would break away from its AM counterpart to air special programming.\n\nWith the CBC's English-language FM network already established since the 1960s, plans were made to create a French-language FM network, with CBF-FM as its originating station. In 1971, in preparation for its role as the French FM flagship, CBF-FM swapped frequencies with CBM-FM. CBF-FM moved to 100.7, just vacated by CBM-FM, while that station moved to a new frequency, 93.5 MHz. The move not only allowed CBF-FM to boost its signal to a full 100,000 watts, but it also began to broadcast in stereo for the first time. \n\nIn 1972, \"La Chaîne Culturelle\" (\"The Cultural Network\") was launched on four CBC-owned FM stations, CBF-FM in Montreal, CBOF-FM in Ottawa, CBV-FM in Quebec City and CBJ-FM in Chicoutimi. The network aired mostly classical music with some jazz and other arts programming. \n\nIn 1998, CBF-FM changed its call sign. Its AM sister station, CBF, moved to the FM band and picked up the CBF-FM call letters. That required the former CBF-FM to switch to a new call sign, CBFX-FM.\n\nIn 2004, the network was renamed \"Espace Musique\". And in 2014, it became \"Ici Musique\", still with 100.7 CBFX-FM as its originating station.\n\n - On April 25, 2013, the CRTC approved the CBC's application to amend the licenses of CBFX's rebroadcasters at Trois-Rivières and Sherbrooke, with both stations broadcasting at least 20 minutes of local programming each week, with the remainder programming from the Espace Musique network. The Trois-Rivières repeater at 104.3 MHz will upgrade to an average ERP of 45,400 watts, and a maximum ERP of 100,000 watts (up from 43,000 watts max ERP currently) with an effective height above average terrain of 249.7 metres. The Sherbrooke transmitter at 90.7 MHz will keep its existing parameters with an ERP of 25,000 watts (non-directional antenna with an EHAAT of 173 metres).\n\nThough CBFX-4 and CBFX-5 are technically rebroadcasters of CBFX, on-air idents show they actually rebroadcast Ottawa's CBOX-FM.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the professional wrestling promotions the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment and World Championship Wrestling in the late 1990 and early 2000s under the ring names Shawn Stasiak and Meat. Championships held by Stasiak over the course of his career include the WCW World Tag Team Championship and WWF Hardcore Championship. Stasiak is the son of former WWWF Champion Stan Stasiak.\n\nBorn in the United States, Stipich was raised in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. He attended White Oaks Secondary School, where he wrestled in Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations events. After graduating, he attended Boise State University, studying communications. During his studies, Stipich made it to second place in the Pacific-10 Conference in two consecutive years.\n\nStipich trained as a professional wrestler under Dory Funk, Jr., debuting in 1996 under the ring name \"Shawn Stasiak\" for the Vancouver-based independent promotion Pacific Coast Championship Wrestling.\n\nIn 1996, Stipich sent a tape consisting of vignettes to the World Wrestling Federation, with one of the segments seeing him dressed up as a Halloween character named Fobia and instructing kids on how to trick-or-treat safely. After reviewing the tape, the WWF allowed him to have a tryout match in October 1997. Stipich was then signed to a developmental deal in January 1998, and he began training with Tom Prichard in the Memphis, Tennessee-based Power Pro Wrestling, where he stayed until he was called up to the WWF in 1999. While with PowerPro, one of the angles he was involved in revolved around Jerry Lawler and his real life wife, Stacy \"The Kat\" Carter. Stasiak first won the services of Stacy for two weeks by beating Jerry Lawler in a match. He then claims that they have started a relationship, and he introduces Stacy to his \"sister\" (storyline). The next week, he introduces Stacy to his \"mother\", Mae Young. This begins a series of different matches between Stasiak, Lawler, Mae Young, and Stacy.\n\nHe made his WWF debut on the April 13, 1999 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\" as Meat, attacking Tiger Ali Singh. He soon became the storyline \"boy-toy\" of the Pretty Mean Sisters (Terri Runnels, Jacqueline, and Ryan Shamrock), although Shamrock left the company a few months later. Meat picked up many victories for a few months over the likes of Droz, Brian Christopher, and The Blue Meanie. However, he would soon be relegated to that of a jobber, with the on-air explanation for this was that he would tire himself out before matches by sexually pleasuring PMS. This led to Jacqueline leaving Meat and Terri by themselves.\n\nThe character only lasted a few months before he split from Terri after Terri saw Meat kissing Marianna, Terri's nemesis, on the Titantron. This led to her and Chaz attacking Meat. In the next couple of weeks, Stipich dropped the Meat name and began to compete under his Shawn Stasiak name. At Survivor Series, Stasiak was defeated by the debuting Kurt Angle.\n\nStasiak was later suspended in December 1999 after he recorded a heated conversation between Davey Boy Smith and Steve Blackman without their permission. Although Stasiak stated that this was done as a joke, he was fired regardless.\n\nAfter working on the independent circuit, Stasiak was signed by World Championship Wrestling in early 2000. After training in the company's Power Plant wrestling school with Paul Orndorff, he made his WCW debut on the April 10, 2000 episode of \"Nitro\" by attacking Curt Hennig. He later joined the New Blood and began feuding with Hennig. He was soon given nicknames such as \"The Perfect One\" and later \"PerfectShawn\" Stasiak, the latter of which was a parody of Hennig's \"Mr. Perfect\" character. Stasiak picked up two victories over Hennig, one of which was Stasiak's WCW pay-per-view debut on May 7, 2000 at Slamboree. Hennig soon became impressed with Stasiak and briefly coached him before Hennig's WCW contract expired in June 2000.\n\nIn late-May, Stasiak formed the tag team called the Perfect Event with Chuck Palumbo, and they soon won the World Tag Team Championship after defeating KroniK (Brian Adams and Bryan Clark). After winning the title, they began feuding with KroniK over the title. In August, the Perfect Event helped form The Natural Born Thrillers alongside Mike Sanders, Sean O'Haire, Mark Jindrak, Johnny the Bull and Reno, while they were briefly \"coached\" by Kevin Nash.\n\nStasiak and Palumbo would later win the World Tag Team Title two more times before splitting in early January 2001 when Stasiak and Palumbo won a tag team battle royal with O'Haire and Jindrak. Sanders declared both teams victorious and that one member from each team would start teaming together and get a tag team title shot against The Insiders (Diamond Dallas Page and Kevin Nash). Palumbo began teaming with O'Haire and they defeated the Insiders and became the World Tag Team Champions while Stasiak and Jindrak began teaming together. In February 2001, the Natural Born Thrillers broke up when Stasiak and Jindrak became jealous of Palumbo and O'Haire. The two teams faced off at SuperBrawl Revenge on February 18, 2001 for the World Tag Team Title, but Palumbo and O'Haire retained.\n\nIn March 2001, Stasiak acquired the services of Miss Hancock as his valet, gaining the nickname \"The Mecca of Manhood\" in the process. He was also, in storyline, hinted as the alleged father of Hancock's baby, which later turned out to be a stack of 8x10 cameras in a stroller. As a heel, Stasiak used the cameras to take pictures of himself before throwing the pictures to fans as a way to show off his physique. While with Miss Hancock, he also started a brief feud with Bam Bam Bigelow. The feud culminated on the very last episode of \"Nitro\" on March 26, 2001, as Stasiak defeated Bigelow in a tattoo match. Following this, WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation and most of the talent contracts, including Stasiak's, were picked up.\n\nStasiak returned to the WWF in July 2001 as part of The Alliance after WCW was bought by the WWF. Stasiak won at InVasion where he, Kanyon, and Hugh Morrus defeated The Big Show, Billy Gunn, and Albert. Throughout August, he was given the gimmick of being clumsy while trying to impress the Alliance's leader, Stone Cold Steve Austin. Every time he tried attacking major WWF stars such as The Rock or Kurt Angle, he would run into a wall, statue, milk truck, or just completely miss and trip over his boots. In late August, Stasiak was also briefly paired with Stacy Keibler again, but she stopped being his valet in late September to manage the Dudley Boyz. He was injured soon after and was out of action until late October.\n\nOn November 18 at Survivor Series, Stasiak, in storyline, lost his job along with all of the Alliance members when Team WWF defeated Team Alliance. The Alliance members still worked house shows and dark matches for a while, however, until being ready to be called up to the main active roster. However, Stasiak was injured in late November and required surgery on his knee to remove his damaged bursa sac. He was later cleared to wrestle on January 1, 2002. In February 2002, Stasiak was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association for training and to work off ring rust.\n\nStasiak was later called up to the Raw brand in late-March 2002 and had his return televised match on the April 7, 2002 edition of \"Sunday Night Heat\", defeating Tommy Dreamer and the following week on \"Sunday Night Heat\" Stasiak was defeated by Goldust.\n\nStasiak made his return on the April 15, 2002 episode of \"Raw\" with a new character that saw him claim that he was from Planet Stasiak, heard voices in his head, talked to himself with rhymes, and acted comically insane. On this same night, Stasiak was defeated by Big Show. Stasiak traded the Hardcore Championship several times with the likes of Steven Richards, Justin Credible, Bradshaw, and Tommy Dreamer until he requested his early release on September 27, 2002 to pursue other business ventures.\n\nAfter his release, Stipich retired from wrestling and became a chiropractor. He currently works for the Advanced Comprehensive Medical team based out of Texas as a chiropractor. In 2007, he received a certificate in manipulation under anesthesia from the Academy of Physical and Manual Medicine in New York. In addition to his work as a chiropractor, Stipich also works as a motivational speaker and uses the Fobia character he created while in college during his talks with children.\n\nIn September 2007, his documentary \"Determined\" was released on DVD.\n\nStipich is the son of former WWWF Champion Stan Stasiak. During his early childhood, Stipich travelled with his father as he wrestled in various territories, and met the likes of André the Giant and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura during this time.\n\n\n\n"}

He worked as a farmer, taking an interest in local government, but it was not until 1954 that he entered Stormont as member for the Enniskillen seat, succeeding Thomas Charles Nelson. In 1960 he was appointed Minister of Agriculture in the government of Lord Brookeborough, which he was to retain under Terence O'Neill. p 120</ref>\n\nHe became one of a number of Stormont MPs critical of leader Terence O'Neill's conciliatory approach towards Nationalists and in 1969 he had the whip withdrawn, along with William Craig. In 1971 the whip was restored under the new Ulster Unionist leader and Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Brian Faulkner. West became Minister of Agriculture once more and retained that position until the Stormont government was dissolved in 1972.\n\nWest emerged as a fierce critic of the negotiations that would lead to the Sunningdale Agreement, and led the \"anti-White Paper\" Unionists in the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973. When in January 1974 the Ulster Unionist Council voted against Faulkner's course of action the latter was forced into resignation. West succeeded him as leader of the party and sought to regain much of the support that the party had lost to breakaway and other Unionist groupings. In the February 1974 general election West negotiated the United Ulster Unionist Coalition with the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party, led by Craig, and the Democratic Unionist Party, led by Ian Paisley, which would put up a single anti-Sunningdale Unionist candidate in all twelve constituencies on a platform of abolishing the power-sharing executive. West himself stood in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and won, albeit due to a split nationalist vote.\n\nThe UUUC campaigned fiercely for the abolition of the executive, which came about in May 1974 following a general strike. West continued to seek ways to expand unionism and recruited the ex-Conservative Member of Parliament Enoch Powell to the party. Powell stood for and won the South Down constituency in the October 1974 general election, but his opposition to the restoration of Stormont and preference for greater integration with the United Kingdom was to cause ruptures within the party. West himself lost his seat in Parliament due to a pact between Nationalists, so having the dubious distinction of being the only MP who served between the two general elections in 1974 who never served in any other Parliament, but he remained leader of the party. The UUUC lasted another few years and won the overwhelming majority of the seats in the 1975 Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention which sought to gain consensus on the future of the province. When the Vanguard Party fell apart over proposals for a voluntary coalition with the Social Democratic and Labour Party, West negotiated with Craig for the majority faction to merge into the Ulster Unionists.\n\nThe 1979 general election was relatively disappointing for the Ulster Unionists, as they won only five of the province's twelve constituencies. In June 1979 West stood as one of two candidates in the first elections to the European Parliament. However he was unsuccessful in the Single Transferable Vote constituency for the entire province and had the personal humiliations of seeing rival DUP leader Ian Paisley top the poll, fellow Ulster Unionist John Taylor win one of the seats and former Ulster Unionist member James Kilfedder performing better than West to become runner up. West resigned shortly afterwards.\n\nHe remained active in the Ulster Unionists for some years and was the party's unsuccessful candidate in the bitter April 1981 by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone caused by the death of the sitting MP Frank Maguire, West received 29,046 votes and was defeated by Bobby Sands standing on an Anti-H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner ticket with 30,493 votes; Sands died twenty-six days after his election. West was considered to have fought a lacklustre campaign, and the UUP chose Ken Maginnis instead to fight the second by-election; although he did not win he was considered to have fought a more dynamic campaign. Afterwards West remained a member of the Ulster Unionist Council and was highly critical of his successor, James Molyneaux, for his opposition to proposals for power sharing devolution.\n\nHe was married to Maureen Hall and they had four sons and three daughters. He was a Presbyterian.\n\nHis nephew is James Cooper, who was chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party from 2003 to 2005 and unsuccessfully was the Party's candidate in Fermanagh and South Tyrone in 2001.\n\nList of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service\n\n"}

The company is the largest petrochemical company in Latin America and has become a major player in the international petrochemical market (8th largest resin producer worldwide).\n\nBraskem is the Americas’ top thermoplastic resins producer. With 36 industrial plants spread across Brazil, United States, Mexico and Germany, the company produces over 16 million tons of thermoplastic resins and other petrochemicals per year. Braskem is the world’s leading biopolymers producer with its 200,000 tons Green PE plant that produces polyethylene from sugarcane-based ethanol.\n\nBraskem controls the three largest petrochemical complexes in Brazil, located in the cities of Camaçari, Bahia, Mauá, São Paulo and Triunfo, Rio Grande do Sul. Besides these three petrochemical complexes, Braskem also controls a complex in Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, which is based on gas rather than naphtha. Its basic petrochemical units account for the supply of ethylene and propylene to the company's nearby polymer units. The company also produces other chemical products such as benzene, butadiene, toluene, xylene and isoprene. These compounds are mostly sold to other chemical companies based within the same complexes, such as Innova S.A., Elekeiroz and Dow Chemical.\n\nAlthough its main feedstock is naphtha, Braskem's green ethylene plant was inaugurated in September, 2010. This green ethylene plant is an important step forward in the strategy of becoming a global leader in sustainable chemicals. The plant is the largest industrial-scale operation in the world producing ethylene made from 100% renewable raw materials, i.e., sugar-cane; however, Sugar cane and other energy crops are not green, nor renewable if the fertilizers used to grow the crops were produced from fossil fuel, such as synthetic nitrogen...NH3. The project was conceived and installed in less than two years based on Braskem’s proprietary technology.\nLocated at the Triunfo petrochemical complex in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the plant produces 200,000 tons of green ethylene, which will be transformed into an equivalent volume of green plastic.\n\nBraskem is Brazil's main producer of polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride – PVC, with 5.7 million tons of resins capacity production in Brazilian territory. The company is also the leader in the US polypropylene market, with 1.5 million tons of capacity production. In addition, its polypropylene capacity production in Germany is 545,000 tons.\n\nBraskem is also implementing an integrated petrochemical complex in Mexico. The complex will consist of a cracker using ethane as feedstock, and three integrated polyethylene plants with a combined annual capacity of 1.05 million tons. The complex will begin production by mid-2015. Developed through a joint venture with the Mexican group Idesa, the project will increase the share of gas in the company’s feedstock matrix, improving its competitiveness.\n\nBraskem was formed in 2002, already Latin America's leading petrochemical company, with industrial units and offices in Brazil, as well as commercial bases in the United States and Argentina. The company was formed by the consolidation of six companies: Copene, OPP, Trikem, Nitrocarbono, Proppet and Polialden. In 2006, Braskem acquired Politeno, the third largest polyethylene producer in Brazil. The company joined Petrobras and Ultrapar the following year in the biggest merger in Brazilian history, when those three companies acquired Grupo Ipiranga for US$4 billion.[3] While Petrobras and Ultrapar shared the fuel distribution operations, Braskem took over Ipiranga Petroquímica, Ipiranga's former petrochemical operation.\n\nIn 2016, Braskem was fined $957 million over a bribery scandal.\n\nBraskem America is the leading producer of polypropylene in the United States, with five production plants located in Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and a Technology and Innovation Center in Pittsburgh. Headquartered in Philadelphia, Braskem America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Braskem S.A.\n\nBraskem Europe is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany with two plants in Schkopau and Wesseling. Braskem Europe is a wholly owned subsidiary of Braskem S.A.\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Braskem announced the acquisition of Quattor, in line with its strategy to strengthen the Brazilian petrochemical chain and become one of the five largest and most competitive petrochemical companies in the world. The acquisition of Quattor Participações S.A., Unipar Comercial e Distribuidora S.A., and Polibutenos S.A. Indústrias Químicas was unanimously and fully approved by the board of directors of the Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE) on February 23, 2011. On February 1, 2010, Braskem announced the acquisition of the PP assets of Sunoco Chemicals, 4th largest polypropylene producer in the U.S. The transaction represented an important step in Braskem’s international expansion process, offering the combination of growth in the U.S. market, with alternative sources of raw materials at competitive costs and access to major consumer markets. With this acquisition, Braskem has become the 3rd largest polypropylene player in the world.\n\nOn July 27, 2011, Braskem announced the acquisition of the polypropylene business (PP) of Dow Chemical. The transaction involved 4 industrial units, 2 plants in the United States and 2 plants in Germany. The U.S. assets, located in Freeport, Texas and Seadrift, Texas, have combined production capacity of 505 kton, which represents 50% of the country’s annual PP production of 1,425 kton. The German assets, located in the cities of Wesseling and Schkopau, have combined annual production capacity of 545 kton. On September 30, 2011, the acquisition was approved by the antitrust agencies of the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as the European Union. The transaction represented an important step forward in consolidating the company’s international expansion and positioned it as the largest PP producer in the United States.\n\nIn 2012, the company commissioned a new PVC plant with annual production capacity of 200 kton in the state of Alagoas. Braskem also expanded its production of butadiene, a key input used by the rubber industry, at its plant located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which increased its annual production capacity of this product by 100 kton; in line with its strategy of adding value to the existing chains.\n\nIn 2014, the company completed its investment in the expansion and conversion of one of its polyethylene production lines in Bahia to produce metallocene-based LLDPE. This resin, of more modern technology, will supply the plastic film industry.\n\n"}

These pioneers were normally employed to march in front of the advancing army, clearing the route as necessary. They could also construct defenses and bivouac facilities. More recently (since the Second World War) assault pioneers have normally formed a Platoon in infantry battalions, and such platoons can be found in a number of British Army and Commonwealth infantry units. In some of these armies, soldiers serving in the Assault Pioneer Platoon can be identified by a specialist skill badge of two crossed felling axes sewn on their uniforms. These felling axes have traditionally been iconic of the pioneer in various armies throughout history.\n\nThe wearing of beards by Assault Pioneers has also been a traditional practice at various times in infantry battalions of British and Commonwealth armies, such as those of Australia and Canada. This tradition began in the French Army (possibly in Napoleonic times) and was one of the dress practices adopted by the British after their defeat of Napoleon in 1815 (along with the Foot Guards bearskin headdress). In the Australian and Canadian armies, on special occasions some battalions may still parade a ceremonial detachment of assault pioneers in historical uniforms wearing leather aprons, gauntlets and gaiters, and carrying the various tools of their trade such as felling axes, crosscut saws, hatchets and billhooks, picks and shovels.\n\nAssault Pioneers do not replace combat engineers: the latter have a much greater range of skills, capabilities and resources. Instead, Assault Pioneers are intended to provide the infantry battalion with its own integral (\"organic\") light engineering support in the same sense as the Mortar Platoon provides the same battalion with its own 'organic' indirect fire support. This organic support permits the infantry battalion to conduct operations effectively without relying on the external support of Combat Engineers who are normally subject to a demanding list of priority tasks across the battlefield. On operations Assault Pioneers often work separately in small detachments providing specialist skills, tools and advice to the infantry companies and platoons with those sub-units providing the bulk of the labour.\n\nThe term 'Assault Pioneer' reflects the tradition (arising in the First and Second World Wars) of employing these soldiers in the first wave of assaults on fortified enemy positions, using their skills and equipment to support the attacking force in crossing and breaching the enemy's defenses. While Assault Pioneers normally function in a specialist role, they are infantry soldiers first and are fully capable of engaging in combat as needed.\n\nDuring World War II British Army Pioneer Platoons had ten Pioneers plus tradesmen. In 1944 they were renamed Assault Pioneer Platoons and had two Assault Sections plus one Pioneer Section. The five man strong Assault Sections had a jeep and trailer and a 3-ton lorry. The Assault Sections had specialist men and equipment for the disposal of mines and breaching obstacles. The Pioneer Section had eight tradesmen, a mason, a bricklayer and six carpenters. The Pioneer Section was used to turn buildings into accommodation for riflemen; riflemen were the principal unit in the British and American army.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873453", "title": "Joaquín Sorolla", "text": "Joaquín Sorolla\n\nJoaquín Sorolla y Bastida (; 27 February 1863 – 10 August 1923) was a Spanish painter. Sorolla excelled in the painting of portraits, landscapes and monumental works of social and historical themes. His most typical works are characterized by a dexterous representation of the people and landscape under the bright sunlight of Spain and sunlit water.\n\nJoaquín Sorolla was born on 27 February 1863 in Valencia, Spain. Sorolla was the eldest child born to a tradesman, also named Joaquin Sorolla, and his wife, Concepción Bastida. His sister, Concha, was born a year later. In August 1865, both children were orphaned when their parents died, possibly from cholera. They were thereafter cared for by their maternal aunt and uncle, a locksmith.\nHe received his initial art education at the age of 9 in his native town, and then under a succession of teachers including Cayetano Capuz, Salustiano Asenjo. At the age of eighteen he traveled to Madrid, vigorously studying master paintings in the Museo del Prado. After completing his military service, Sorolla, at age twenty-two, obtained a grant which enabled a four-year term to study painting in Rome, Italy, where he was welcomed by and found stability in the example of Francisco Pradilla, the director of the Spanish Academy in Rome. A long sojourn to Paris in 1885 provided his first exposure to modern painting; of special influence were exhibitions of Jules Bastien-Lepage and Adolf von Menzel. Back in Rome he studied with José Benlliure, Emilio Sala, and José Villegas Cordero.\n\nIn 1888, Sorolla returned to Valencia to marry Clotilde García del Castillo, whom he had first met in 1879, while working in her father's studio. By 1895, they would have three children together: Maria, born in 1890, Joaquín, born in 1892, and Elena, born in 1895. In 1890, they moved to Madrid, and for the next decade Sorolla's efforts as an artist were focussed mainly on the production of large canvases of orientalist, mythological, historical, and social subjects, for display in salons and international exhibitions in Madrid, Paris, Venice, Munich, Berlin, and Chicago.\n\nHis first striking success was achieved with \"Another Marguerite\" (1892), which was awarded a gold medal at the National Exhibition in Madrid, then first prize at the Chicago International Exhibition, where it was acquired and subsequently donated to the Washington University Museum in St. Louis, Missouri. He soon rose to general fame and became the acknowledged head of the modern Spanish school of painting. His picture \"The Return from Fishing\" (1894) was much admired at the Paris Salon and was acquired by the state for the Musée du Luxembourg. It indicated the direction of his mature output.\n\nSorolla painted two masterpieces in 1897 linking art and science: \"Portrait of Dr. Simarro at the microscope\" and \"A Research\". These paintings were presented at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts held in Madrid in that year and Sorolla won the Prize of Honor. Here, he presents his friend Simarro as a man of science who transmits his wisdom investigating and, in addition, it is the triumph of naturalism, as it recreates the indoor environment of the laboratory, catching the luminous atmosphere produced by the artificial reddish-yellow light of a gas burner that contrasts with the weak mauvish afternoon light that shines through the window. These paintings may be among the most outstanding world paintings of this genre.\n\nAn even greater turning point in Sorolla's career was marked by the painting and exhibition of \"Sad Inheritance\" (1899, seen at right), an extremely large canvas, highly finished for public consideration. The subject was a depiction of crippled children bathing at the sea in Valencia, under the supervision of a monk. They are the victims of hereditary syphilis the title implies, perhaps. Campos has suggested that the polio epidemic that struck the land of Valencia some years earlier is present, possibly for the first time in the history of painting, through the image of two affected children. The painting earned Sorolla his greatest official recognition, the Grand Prix and a medal of honor at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1900, and the medal of honor at the National Exhibition in Madrid in 1901.\n\nA series of preparatory oil sketches for \"Sad Inheritance\" were painted with the greatest luminosity and bravura, and foretold an increasing interest in shimmering light and of a medium deftly handled. Sorolla thought well enough of these sketches that he presented two of them as gifts to American artists; one to John Singer Sargent, the other to William Merritt Chase. After this painting Sorolla never returned to a theme of such overt social consciousness.\n\nThe exhibit at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900 won him a medal of honour and his nomination as Knight of the Legion of Honour; within the next few years Sorolla was honoured as a member of the Fine Art Academies of Paris, Lisbon, and Valencia, and as a Favourite Son of Valencia.\n\nA special exhibition of his works—figure subjects, landscapes and portraits—at the Galeries Georges Petit in Paris in 1906 eclipsed all his earlier successes and led to his appointment as Officer of the Legion of Honour. The show included nearly 500 works, early paintings as well as recent sun-drenched beach scenes, landscapes, and portraits, a productivity which amazed critics and was a financial triumph. Though subsequent large-scale exhibitions in Germany and London were greeted with more restraint, while in England in 1908 Sorolla met Archer Milton Huntington, who made him a member of The Hispanic Society of America in New York City, and invited him to exhibit there in 1909. The exhibition comprised 356 paintings, 195 of which sold. Sorolla spent five months in America and painted more than twenty portraits.\n\nSorolla's work is often exhibited together with that of his contemporaries and friends, John Singer Sargent and Anders Zorn.\n\nAlthough formal portraiture was not Sorolla's genre of preference, because it tended to restrict his creative appetites and could reflect his lack of interest in his subjects, the acceptance of portrait commissions proved profitable, and the portrayal of his family was irresistible. Sometimes the influence of Velázquez was uppermost, as in \"My Family\" (1901), a reference to Las Meninas which grouped his wife and children in the foreground, the painter reflected, at work, in a distant mirror. At other times the desire to compete with his friend John Singer Sargent was evident, as in \"Portrait of Mrs. Ira Nelson Morris and her children\" (1911). A series of portraits produced in the United States in 1909, commissioned through the Hispanic Society of America, was capped by the \"Portrait of Mr. Taft, President of the United States\", This portrait, which was painted at the White House, is on permanent display at the Taft Museum of Art in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nThe appearance of sunlight could be counted on to rouse his interest, and it was outdoors where he found his ideal portrait settings. Thus, not only did his daughter pose standing in a sun-dappled landscape for \"María at La Granja\" (1907), but so did Spanish royalty, for the \"Portrait of King Alfonso XIII in a Hussar's Uniform\" (1907). For \"Portrait of Mr. Louis Comfort Tiffany\" (1911),\nthe American artist posed seated at his easel in his Long Island garden, surrounded by extravagant flowers. The conceit reaches its high point in \"My Wife and Daughters in the Garden\" (1910, see gallery below), in which the idea of traditional portraiture gives way to the sheer fluid delight of a painting constructed with thick passages of color, Sorolla's love of family and sunlight merged.\n\nEarly in 1911, Sorolla visited the United States for a second time, and exhibited 152 new paintings at the Saint Louis Art Museum\n\nand 161 at the Art Institute of Chicago a few weeks later. \nLater that year Sorolla met Archie Huntington in Paris and signed a contract to paint a series of oils on life in Spain. These 14 magnificent murals, installed to this day in the Hispanic Society of America building in Manhattan, range from 12 to 14 feet in height, and total 227 feet in length. The major commission of his career, it would dominate the later years of Sorolla's life.\n\nHuntington had envisioned the work depicting a history of Spain, but the painter preferred the less specific \"Vision of Spain\", eventually opting for a representation of the regions of the Iberian Peninsula, and calling it \"The Provinces of Spain\". Despite the immensity of the canvases, Sorolla painted all but one en plein air, and travelled to the specific locales to paint them: Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Elche, Seville, Andalusia, Extremadura, Galicia, Guipuzcoa, Castile, Leon, and Ayamonte, at each site painting models posed in local costume. Each mural celebrated the landscape and culture of its region, panoramas composed of throngs of laborers and locals. By 1917 he was, by his own admission, exhausted. He completed the final panel by July 1919.\n\nSorolla suffered a stroke in 1920, while painting a portrait in his garden in Madrid. Paralysed for over three years, he died on 10 August 1923. He is buried in the Cementeri de Valencia, Spain.\n\nThe Sorolla Room, housing the \"Provinces of Spain\" at the Hispanic Society of America, opened to the public in 1926. The room closed for remodeling in 2008, and the murals toured museums in Spain for the first time. The Sorolla Room reopened in 2010, with the murals on permanent display.\n\nSorolla's influence on some other Spanish painters, such as Alberto Pla y Rubio and Julio Romero de Torres, was so noted that they are described as \"sorollista.\"\n\nAfter his death, Sorolla's widow, Clotilde García del Castillo, left many of his paintings to the Spanish public. The paintings eventually formed the collection that is now known as the Museo Sorolla, which was the artist's house in Madrid. The museum opened in 1932.\n\nSorolla's work is represented in museums throughout Spain, Europe, America, and in many private collections in Europe and America. In 1933, J. Paul Getty purchased ten Impressionist beach scenes made by Sorolla, several of which are now housed in the J. Paul Getty Museum.\n\nIn 1960, \"Sorolla, el pintor de la luz\", a short documentary written and directed by Manuel Domínguez was presented at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe Spanish National Dance Company honored the painter's \"The Provinces of Spain\" by producing a ballet \"Sorolla\" based on the paintings.\n\nValencia high-speed railway station has been named after Sorolla.\n\nIn 2007 many of his works were exhibited at the Petit Palais in Paris, alongside those of John Singer Sargent, a contemporary who painted in a similarly impressionist-influenced manner. In 2009, there was a special exhibition of his works at the Prado in Madrid, and in 2010, the exhibition visited the Oscar Niemeyer Museum in Curitiba, Brazil.\n\nFrom 5 December 2011 to 10 March 2012, several of Sorolla's works were exhibited in Queen Sofía Spanish Institute, in New York. This exhibition included pieces used during Sorolla's eight-year research for \"Vision of Spain\".\n\nAn exhibition titled \"Sorolla & America\" explored Sorolla's unique relationship with the United States in the early twentieth century. The exhibition opened at the Meadows Museum at SMU in Dallas (13 December 2013 – 19 April 2014). From there it traveled to the San Diego Museum of Art (30 May – 26 August 2014) and then to Fundación MAPFRE in Madrid (23 September 2014 – 11 January 2015).\n\nIn 2016 the Munich Kunsthalle held an major Sarolla exhibition.\n\nIn 2019 the National Gallery, London, held a major temporary Sorolla exhibition, titled \"Sorolla: Spanish Master of Light\".\n\n"}

It is traversed by Forest Service Road 33, a gravel road that is closed in winter but passable by two-wheel drive automobiles in good weather. In winter, the road is used by cross-country skiers. The road over the pass goes north from the town of Como in the northern South Park northeast of Fairplay, crossing the path northward to Breckenridge. In good weather, it furnishes an alternative route to nearby Hoosier Pass, offering splendid views of aspen trees and nearby Mount Silverheels and the Tenmile Range. The round trip up to the top from Breckenridge is popular with bicyclists.\nThe pass was formerly known as Breckenridge Pass in the 1860s, when it served as an early route for thousands of prospectors during the Colorado Gold Rush who crossed from South Park to look for gold in the valley of the Blue around Breckenridge. In 1866, it was widened to a wagon road that accommodated stagecoaches. In 1882, under the direction of Sidney Dillon of the Union Pacific Railroad, the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad (by then controlled by the Union Pacific) begun laying narrow gauge tracks up the pass, which Dillon renamed in honor of Boreas, the Ancient Greek god of the North Wind. The line was a spur to Breckenridge (eventually extended to Leadville) off the company's main line from Denver through South Park. A roundhouse, still in existence, was constructed at Como at the junction of the lines. The rail line over the pass was a major engineering feat, primarily because of the winter snows at high altitude. When completed, it had dozens of snow sheds along its route, which approached a 4% grade in many places. A town of Boreas, now a ghost town, was constructed at the summit, primarily to house workers to clear the line in winter. The line was abandoned in 1937 by the Colorado & Southern, along with most of the company's narrow gauge right-of-way. After World War II, the Army Corps of Engineers reconstructed the route for automobile traffic. On the north side of the pass, Forest Service Road 593 leads to the 1880s ghost town site of Dyersville, as well as many abandoned mining sites.\n\nThe Boreas Pass Ditch was completed in 1910 to divert water over the pass from the headwaters of Indiana Creek, a tributary of the Blue River into North Tarryall Creek, a tributary of the South Platte River. The 0.8 mile (1.3 km) ditch has a capacity of 16 cubic feet per second (0.45m/s), and in an average year, it transports about 140 acre-feet (170,000m) of water. The ditch was originally built to irrigate land in South Park, but it currently serves the city of Englewood, which rehabilitated the ditch In 1990.\n\nThe Boreas Railroad Station Site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n"}

Boarding and flexi-boarding is available to a limited number of students from the age of 11. There are approximately 700 students in the Senior School, and 300 in the Preparatory School.\n\nSince 1950, the school has occupied Kimbolton Castle (the former seat of the Dukes of Manchester) and its grounds.\n\nThe school is the successor to the village grammar school; although there are references to a school at Kimbolton as early as 1531, the generally accepted date for its foundation is 1600. The school originally occupied buildings within the churchyard, but moved to new premises in Tilbrook Road in the late 19th century. In 1949 it was renamed from Kimbolton Grammar School to Kimbolton School, and the following year it bought Kimbolton Castle from the Duke of Manchester.\n\nThe Senior School is based in the grounds of the Castle, and its Preparatory School is based at the other end of the village, but is connected to the senior school by 'The Duchess Walk', a tree-lined avenue. The school grounds total over .\n\nThe School's Latin motto is: \"\"Spes Durat Avorum\"\" (\"Let the hope of our forefathers endure\").\n\nThe School has a tradition of long-serving headmasters. Some of its features are named after them:\n\n\nKimbolton School's campus is currently situated upon Kimbolton Castle grounds. This land is in conjunction with some other areas of land owned by the school prior to the purchase of the castle in 1950.\n\nThe School's total campus area comes to ~105 acres.\n\nThe Castle was bought by Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, in 1615. His descendants owned the Castle for 335 years until it was sold in 1950.\n\nCharles Edward Montagu, the 4th Earl, who was created 1st Duke of Manchester in 1719, had reconstruction works carried out between 1690 and 1720. Sir John Vanbrugh and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor redesigned the facades of the Castle in a classical style, but with battlements to evoke its history as a castle, the portico was later added by Alessandro Galilei. The Venetian painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini redecorated some of the reconstructed rooms in 1708. These rooms included the main staircase, now called the Pellegrini Staircase, and the chapel. Gilded furnishings in a Louis XIV-inspired style by French upholsterers working in London were also commissioned.\n\nFor a later Duke, Robert Adam produced plans for the Castle Gatehouse and other garden buildings, including an orangery. Only one of these buildings, the gatehouse, was constructed, in around 1764. Mews buildings were added to provide stables, and an avenue of giant sequoias was planted in the 19th century.\n\nThe Castle was used by the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War II, and the 10th Duke of Manchester sold the Castle to the School in 1950. The furnishings were scattered in sales and some have come to national collections. There is limited public opening during the school holidays and at weekends.\n\nThe Castle is mostly used for 6th form and Spanish teaching, and houses staff areas plus the 6th form common-room.\n\nThe Castle also used for meetings, weddings and social/public events. On occasion it is used as a television/film location. Most teaching and other activities take place in other buildings, on the school grounds.\n\nThe Vanbrugh Library at the Senior School holds over 12,000 books and periodicals.\n\nKimbolton school is divided into sections according to academic year (or Form); some of these sections make use of a culturally fitting House system:\n\nThere are around 300 pupils in the Preparatory School (ages 4 to 11), in four houses named after the families that owned the castle: Fitzpiers, Montagu, Stafford and Wingfield. Preparatory school pupils can be identified by their solid purple blazers.\nThere are around 700 students in the senior school, aged 11 to 18. This includes the sixth form.\nA house originally for boarders, Ingrams, was merged with Dawsons in the 1980s. Ingrams was later revived as a separate house for all First Form and Second Form pupils (these pupils are now colloquially referred to as \"Ingrams\"). Ingrams compete in a separate House competition to the rest of the senior school. As opposed to between houses, the students compete between classes, they have many of the same events as the senior houses.\nIn four Houses, named after the two founders and two previous teachers at the school: Balyes, Dawsons, Gibbards, and Owens. Until recently, all the boarders were in Dawsons House; they are now allocated to all four senior houses. Uniform differentiating the senior school from the rest of the school includes–most notably–black, purple and white striped blazers.\nSixth Form students all wear solid-black suits. Upper Sixth formers are also permitted to choose their own coloured jumpers and–for male pupils–ties.\n\nThe boarding houses are situated on Kimbolton High Street. The boy's boarding house, 'Kimbolton House', is by the top of the High Street, while the girl's boarding house, 'White House', is at the bottom, opposite the church.\n\nAll of the boarders eat together in the Dining Hall, and attend the Chapel fortnightly.\n\n\nThe Old Kimboltonians' Association (OKA) provides a network between former students of the School. This usually manifests social events, sports fixtures and annual reunions.\n\n\n"}

Joseph has just been informed of the nature of Jesus by an angel and in this verse the author of Matthew relates this to a quote from the Old Testament.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 1:23\n\nThe quote is from with Matthew using the same wording as the Septuagint (LXX). The one alteration is that the phrase \"they shall name\" is changed to \"you shall name.\" This switches the meaning somewhat from Immanuel being a title proclaimed by the people to a name given by Joseph. The author of Matthew still treats the name as more of a title as Joseph actually names his son Jesus. The Masoretic text has the unspecified \"and shall name\".\n\nThere is much debate over the meaning of Isaiah 7:14. Most scholars today claim the Hebrew word \"'almah\", used in Isaiah, would more accurately be translated as \"young woman\" rather than \"virgin\". However, the Septuagint version of Isaiah, which was translated by seventy Jewish scholars in the 2nd century BCE, and the Gospel of Matthew both use the Greek word \"parthenos\", which unambiguously translates as \"virgin\". Biblical scholar Margaret Barker points out that the text uses the definite article, reading \"ha-'almah\" and therefore \"The Virgin,\" an ancient title for the Holy Spirit. This view is supported by the apocryphal Gospel of the Hebrews in which Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit as his mother. For a full discussion of this debate see Virgin Birth.\n\nScholars have other concerns with Matthew's reference to Isaiah. France, for instance, believes that it is far more likely that Isaiah is referring to the far more immediate future. The Hebrew can even be interpreted to say that the conception in question had already taken place when Isaiah was writing.\n\nCarter believes the real importance of this verse is in its wider context in Isaiah. He argues that the readers of Matthew would have been very familiar with Isaiah and would immediately recognize the context of this verse. The verse occurs when Judah is under threat from the Syrians. Isaiah promises that God can save Israel from this threat, but that if the Jews continue to sin the Assyrian empire will be the instrument of God's vengeance. Carter believes that Matthew is using this situation as an allegory for the time in which he was writing. Immanuel if followed will lead to salvation from the empire, in Matthew's time the Roman, but if the messiah is rebuffed that same empire will be God's instrument of punishment for the Jewish people as presented by the destruction of the temple in 70 AD.\n\n\n"}

She is best known for the films \"A Town Like Alice\" (1956), \"Carve Her Name with Pride\" (1958), \"Born Free\" (1966), and \"Ring of Bright Water\" (1969), as well as her work with The Born Free Foundation.\n\nMcKenna was born in Marylebone to a theatrical family and was educated at Heron's Ghyll School, a former independent boarding school near the market town of Horsham in Sussex. She spent six years in South Africa before returning to the School at the age of fourteen, after which she attended the Central School of Speech and Drama, then based at the Royal Albert Hall, London.\n\nAged 19, McKenna spent six months at Dundee Repertory Theatre. She worked on stage in London's West End theatre, making her debut in \"Penny for a Song\". She attracted attention on TV appearing in \"Winter's Tale\" with John Gielgud and \"Shout Aloud Salvation\".\n\nMcKenna's first film was \"The Second Mrs Tanqueray\" (1952), followed by a comedy, \"Father's Doing Fine\" (1952). She had a small role in the popular war film \"The Cruel Sea\" (1953) and a better part in the low budget comedy \"The Oracle\" (1953). She received excellent reviews for her stage performance in \"The River Line\".\n\nFrom 1954 to 1955 she was a member of the Old Vic theatre company, appearing in \"Henry IV\" and \"Richard II\", and was married for a few months in 1954 to actor Denholm Elliott, whom she met on the set of \"The Cruel Sea\". Their marriage ended, owing to his affairs with men. In 1957, she married actor Bill Travers, with whom she had four children and to whom she remained married until his death in 1994.\n\nMcKenna returned to films with \"Simba\" (1955), a drama about the Mau Mau, playing Dirk Bogarde's love interest. Rank signed her to a long term contract and director Brian Desmond Hurst said \"She has a terrific future, properly handled. She has all the qualities of a young\nBergman and a young Katharine Hepburn. McKenna was also in \"The Ship That Died of Shame\" (1955).\n\nMcKenna was given the lead role in the war time drama \"A Town Like Alice\" (1956), opposite Peter Finch. The movie was a big hit at the box office and McKenna won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress for her performance. Exhibitors voted her the fourth most popular British star.\n\nTravers and McKenna received an offer to go to Hollywood to appear in \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" (1957). Travers played Robert Browning and McKenna had the support part of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's sister. The movie flopped at the box office. The same year, Travers and McKenna, along with Margaret Rutherford and Peter Sellers, co-starred in the comedy \"The Smallest Show on Earth\", made back in Britain.\n\nMcKenna had another hit with \"Carve Her Name with Pride\" (1958), playing Second World War SOE agent Violette Szabo. She was nominated for another BAFTA Award and was voted the fifth most popular British star of 1958 (and the ninth most popular regardless of nationality).\n\nShe and Travers were reunited in \"Passionate Summer\" (1959), then she had a support part in MGM's \"The Wreck of the Mary Deare\" (1959). McKenna and Travers were also in \"Two Living, One Dead\" (1961), shot in Sweden. She was in an adaptation of \"A Passage to India\" for the BBC in 1965.\n\nMcKenna is best remembered for her 1966 role as Joy Adamson in the true-life film \"Born Free\" for which she received a nomination for a Golden Globe. It was not only a huge success at the box office but a life changing experience for her and Bill Travers who co-starred with her, portraying game warden George Adamson. The experience led them to become active supporters for wild animal rights as well as the protection of their natural habitat.\n\nMcKenna and Travers starred in another animal-themed story, \"Ring of Bright Water\" (1969), but it failed to match \"Born Free\"'s success.\n\nMcKenna appeared in \"An Elephant Called Slowly\". The film features her close friend conservationist George Adamson and also elephants Eleanor (brought up by conservationist Daphne Sheldrick) and young Pole Pole. The subsequent premature death of Pole Pole in London Zoo led to McKenna and her husband to establish Zoo Check in 1984 with their eldest son Will Travers.

Over the years she appeared in more films but was also very active with television roles and on stage where she continues to make occasional appearances.\n\nMcKenna has also been responsible for helping create and furnish the Gavin Maxwell Museum on Eilean Bàn, the last island home of Maxwell, an author and naturalist, most famous for his book \"Ring of Bright Water\". McKenna and husband Bill Travers starred in the 1969 film adaptation of the book.\n\nMcKenna is still actively involved at Born Free Foundation, as a Trustee.\n\nMcKenna was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 New Year Honours for services to wildlife and to the arts. Her autobiography, \"The Life in My Years\", was published by Oberon Books in March 2009.\n\nIn 1975 she released an album of twelve songs called \"Two Faces of Love\", which included two of her own compositions and a sung version of the poem \"The Life That I Have\" from the film \"Carve Her Name with Pride\".

It was founded in 1885 as Southwest Kansas Conference College and graduated its first class of three in June 1889. The name of the school was changed to its current form in 1909.\n\nThe first step towards the establishment of Southwest Kansas Conference College took place in the spring of 1884 when land was platted for the purpose east of Wichita, Kansas. With construction slated for the future, in October of that same year the principals behind the project decided to acquire a substantial residence to serve as a temporary building for the school. The Wichita home of a certain Dr. Crokey, located on the corner of Central and Topeka Avenues, was obtained for this purpose at a cost of $4,000. Initial plans called for establishment of a school with academic departments in the fields of business, music, and art.\n\nThe school was incorporated in Topeka on October 9, 1884, headed by a nine-member board of directors. No courses were conducted during the 1884-85 school year, however, and the project remained dormant.\n\nThe Southwest Kansas Conference of the Methodist Church affirmed its connection with the college project at its April 1885 annual meeting at El Dorado. There the regional division of the church formally decided to establish a college within the district, selecting a committee of 7 headed by Rev. N.S. Buckner to find a suitable permanent location. Conditions established by the committee included the availability of at least 20 acres of land and community donations of at least $15,000 towards completion of the project.\n\nThe committee's decision on siting was initially slated for a meeting to be held in Wichita on May 12, 1885. This proved to be a preliminary gathering, however, at which guidelines for bids were established and interested communities made their initial presentations. Communities making initial appeals for the siting of the college included El Dorado, Harper, Newton, Peabody, Winfield, and Wichita. The towns of Hutchinson and Wellington also later made proposals. A tour of visitation by Buckner's siting committee was planned.\n\nFormal decision was rendered at a meeting held in Wichita on June 9, 1885, at which the bid of Winfield was accepted. Winfield in its winning bid pledged $40,000 towards college construction, 20 acres of land for the campus, additional payments of $2,000 a year for ten years, and an additional 40 acres of land. The selection of Winfield was met the next day with Cowley County approving the issuance of $100,000 in bonds on behalf of the Denver, Memphis & Atlantic Railway for the expeditious construction of a new railway line to the town.\n\nConstruction of the main college building began in the fall of 1885 upon a plan designed by W.A. Ritchie, with the 4-story building anticipated to be ready for occupancy September 1, 1886, in time for the 1886–87 academic year. Dormitory cottages were also to be built. Total cost of construction was projected at $60,000. Upon completion the building was touted in the local press as \"one of the finest buildings in the state.\"\n\nIn April 1886, Dr. John E. Earp, formerly head of Indiana Asbury University, a Methodist-affiliated college in Greencastle, Indiana, was tapped by the board of trustees as the first President of the Southwest Kansas Conference College.\n\nSouthwest Kansas Conference College graduated its first class of 3 students on June 3, 1889.\n\nIn 1909 the name of Southwest Kansas Conference College was changed to Southwestern College.\n\nThe main campus is a laptop learning community, with laptop computers provided to all incoming students. An emphasis on service learning has led to nationally recognized programs in leadership, discipleship, and sustainability (green issues). In addition to bachelor's degrees, several master's programs give undergraduate students the option of completing a graduate degree. Its doctoral degree in education started during the summer of 2012.\n\nSouthwestern College's professional studies programs focus on degree completion for working adults. Six professional studies sites in three states allow students to earn their bachelor's degrees and selected master's programs in either a traditional classroom setting or online. The ground locations are in Wichita, McConnell AFB, Fort Riley, Kansas and Midwest City, Oklahoma.\n\nThe school owns and operates radio station KSWC-LP.\n\nSouthwestern College is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association. It is further accredited by the University Senate of the United Methodist Church and other accrediting bodies for individual majors.\n\nSouthwestern College teams are nicknamed as the Moundbuilders. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field and volleyball.\n\nThe Men's Track Team has won 30 consecutive conference championships, while the women have won 16 straight. Men's Cross Country has won 30 consecutive conference championships, while the women have won 4 straight and 11 of the last 14, with the school garnering 134 conference championships in nine different sports since 1960. The track teams are coached by Jim Helmer and Mike Kirkland. The school has had over 160 All-American scholar-athletes since 1980.\n\nSouthwestern College football players have gone on to successful coaching careers, including Jerry Kill, a former head football coach at the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe college's nickname, \"Moundbuilders,\" (frequently shortened to just \"Builders\") has inspired the creation of a large pile of rocks on the college campus, called \"The Mound.\" At the beginning of each school year, the \"Moundbuilding Ceremony\" allows students, faculty, clubs, and guests of Southwestern College to place a rock on the Mound. Participants are invited to decorate their rocks with paint, and some are decorated quite creatively. Although rocks are never removed from the Mound, the Mound itself was moved from the upper campus to the lower campus in the 1970s when Darbeth Fine Arts Building was built on the original site of the Mound. A major renovation in 2006 added a plaza area around the Mound with commemorative stones, benches, and landscaping.\n\nThe nickname Moundbuilders originated in 1910 when students wanted to be called something other than \"Preachers\" or \"Methodists.\" Editorialists toyed with various suggestions based on the fact that Southwestern students lived on \"the hill.\" The name \"Cliff-dwellers\" was suggested but was ultimately scrapped for \"Moundbuilders\" after student Harry Hart wrote that \"anybody could just dwell there, but 'builders' shows action.\" The Moundbuilding ceremony was instituted in 1927 by Dean Leroy Allen who said, \"Nobody but Moundbuilders can build mounds. So no other college has now, or ever is likely to have such a custom.\"\n\nThe Order of the Mound is the official Honor Society for Southwestern College graduates. Although the society was formally organized in 1917, membership in the Order of the Mound includes graduates from 1889 onward. In 1927, a process was established to induct qualified graduates from years prior to 1917.\n\nCurrently, to qualify for induction, students must be in the top 10% of all graduates who have completed at least 60 graded hours or more at Southwestern College.\n\n\n"}

King (born 1930) is the founder of the school of thought known as \"transmillennialism\". King was a minister in the Churches of Christ for 40 years before developing Transmillennialism.\n\nKing pioneered a field of theology that he termed \"covenant eschatology.\" Within fundamentalist and conservative Evangelical contexts, he contended that Biblical eschatology was not related to the end of the space-time universe, but to the transition of the Old Covenant to the New Covenant. King offered a unique interpretation concerning the millennium as found in Revelation 20 as pertaining to the forty-year period from 30-70 AD. He called this time \"the transition period\" from Old Covenant to New Covenant. In King's view, this transition opened the way for the full presence of God to dwell with all of humanity. To describe this relationship, King coined the phrase \"Comprehensive Grace.\"\n\nKing's transmillennialism emerged in the late 1990s as an alternative to dispensational premillennialism, amillennialism or postmillennialism. It differentiated itself from Reformed preterism and Christian reconstructionism in view of postmodern issues facing the emerging church and the need to forward its scholarship in the context of historical Jesus studies. In King's view, the covenantal transformation of the first century serves as a model for personal, organizational and societal transformation today. King's first major book, \"The Spirit of Prophecy\", was published in 1971. He published a monthly print journal, \"The Living Presence\", for 15 years; it is currently available in electronic format. King's annual \"Covenant Eschatology Seminar\" spanned the 1990s and continued through the early 2000s as the \"Transmillennial\" national conference. Some of King's other major works include \"Old Covenant Israel and New Covenant Salvation\" and \"The Cross and The Parousia of Christ\".

{"id": "1873508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873508", "title": "The Fabulous Freebirds", "text": "The Fabulous Freebirds\n\nThe Fabulous Freebirds were a professional wrestling tag team who attained fame in the 1980s, performing into the 1990s. The team usually consisted of three wrestlers, although in different situations and points in its history, just two performed under the Freebirds name. The Freebird version of Hayes, Roberts, and Gordy was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2015, and members Hayes, Roberts, Gordy, and Garvin were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nThe Fabulous Freebirds started performing together in 1979 when Mid South Wrestling promoter Bill Watts put together the duo of Michael \"P.S.\" Hayes and Terry \"Bam Bam\" Gordy. Though originally meant to be a tag team, he soon added Buddy \"Jack\" Roberts into the mix, and they became a \"three man gang\" type of tag-team—an unusual concept at the time. They invented a concept that is now called The Freebird Rule in their honor, in which any two of three members can defend the team's championships. They usually worked as heels but also had several face runs as well.\nAfter wrestling for Watts in Mid South, they worked for Memphis based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) where they feuded with Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee.\n\nThe group next wrestled in the Dallas-based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) territory, where they had a legendary feud with the Von Erichs (David, Kevin, Kerry, Chris and Mike). This feud was ignited by an infamous incident in which Terry Gordy slammed Kerry Von Erich's head in a steel cage door, inciting a riot. During this feud, as the Von Erichs would wave the flag of Texas, the Freebirds started using the flag of Georgia, which contained the Confederate battle flag, as a group symbol to counter it.\n\nThey also performed in the NWA-affiliated Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the American Wrestling Association (AWA), and the Oklahoma-based Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). While in the AWA they feuded primarily with The Road Warriors, costing them the World Tag Team Titles in a match against long time Freebird ally Jimmy Garvin and his partner Steve Regal.\n\nThey had a very brief run in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1984, where they were a part of the Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection period. In the WWF, they wrestled under the guidance of Cyndi Lauper's manager David Wolff, but soon left the promotion after an altercation with André the Giant, who was upset when the Freebirds arrived late to a show.\n\nThe group then moved on to their AWA run, returned to World Class, and then started a stint in the UWF where Gordy became the promotion's champion, Roberts held its TV title, and Hayes usually acted as their manager or served as a heel commentator on television broadcasts. After JCP purchased UWF in 1987, Hayes wrestled in World Class and several independent promotions, sometimes with Gordy, who began spending most of his time in Japan, and Roberts began to wind down his career.\n\nHayes and Garvin were paired as the Freebirds in WCW in 1989, enjoying several reigns as World and United States tag-team champions, and were joined by Gordy for a while as well. They later employed the services of masked third partner Brad Armstrong (under the name Badstreet) and managers Diamond Dallas Page, Big Daddy Dink, Little Richard Marley and Precious (Garvin's real-life wife and longtime valet). The Freebirds were last together when Hayes, Gordy, and Garvin worked for the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in 1994, ending the group after 15 years.\n\nGordy died of a heart attack, caused by a blood clot on July 16, 2001, at age 40 while Roberts died on November 29, 2012, at the age of 67, of pneumonia and on November 1, 2012, Armstrong died of a suspected heart attack making Hayes and Garvin the only living members of the Freebirds. Hayes (who retired from in-ring competition shortly after the Freebirds disbanded) is currently the head of the road agents/producers within WWE, while Garvin retired from wrestling shortly after disbanding and has become an Airline Transport Pilot.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, The Fabulous Freebirds (excluding Brad Armstrong) were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by The New Day.\n\nThe Freebirds concept was heavily derived from the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Free Bird\" and the image of \"Southern pride\" evoked by the band. For most of the team's early existence, the song was used as their entrance music, in both television and live appearances. On occasion, they would also enter the ring to Willie Nelson's rendition of \"Georgia on My Mind\". The Freebirds are sometimes credited as the first wrestlers to use entrance music for their ring introductions, although others including Gorgeous George's use of \"Pomp and Circumstance,\" Big Daddy's use of \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" and Kendo Nagasaki's use of \"Kendo's Theme\" all predate the Freebirds.\n\nDuring the mid 1980s, a number of North American wrestling promotions who licensed copyrighted music faced difficulties in continuing those licenses. Other promotions which did not license music were under scrutiny for the practice. Promotions began looking for solutions. The WWF, which hired Jimmy Hart and Jim Johnston in 1985, used their talents to write and produce music under which the copyrights could be controlled by the company. Around this same time, Hayes recorded the song \"Badstreet USA\" and released a music video, which included the other Freebird members. This song would largely be used as the entrance music for the Freebirds from that point forward, though they would use the other songs on occasion.\n\nDuring the Freebirds' career in the NWA, they won several of its regional tag team championships. While holding the title, promoters added a sub-gimmick to the team – \"The Freebird Rule\" – which allowed any two of the three members of the team to defend the title on any given night.\n\nThis rule has been re-used by a number of other companies when a three (or more) man team captures a tag team championship. Examples include:\n\nIn some cases, the Freebird rule has been applied to singles titles, most notably when Chyna and Chris Jericho co-held the WWF Intercontinental Championship in 2000. Other such cases included when 3 Count won the WCW Hardcore Championship in 2000, and when Matt Bentley and Frankie Kazarian co-held the TNA X Division Championship in 2004. In 2010, after Layla won the WWE Women's Championship, Team LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool) co-held the title. This was a slight variation to the Freebird rule, as while both women defended the title, only Layla was recognized as the official champion. Later that year, the same rule was instituted when Michelle McCool won the WWE Divas Championship; both members of Team LayCool defended the title, but only McCool was recognized as official champion. A similar situation happened in Ring of Honor (ROH) in 2017, where Bullet Club invoked \"Bullet Club Rules\", which allowed Cody, Kenny Omega and Marty Scurll to defend the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. However, only the title's original winners, Adam Page, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson, were recognized as official champions.\n\nThe Blackbirds were formed in 1988 in World Class Championship Wrestling by Iceman Parsons. He had just teamed with Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts as the \"Blackbirds\" in their feud with Michael Hayes. He teamed up with Perry \"Action\" Jackson and Harold T. Harris to form the Blackbirds. They also wrestled as the Blackbirds in the Global Wrestling Federation in 1992.\n\nThe Extreme Freebirds were formed in NWA Wildside and the NAWA by the son of Terry Gordy, Ray Gordy. He teamed up with Tank and Iceberg in 2004 to form this group.\n\nThe original three Freebirds briefly appear in a match against Greg Gagne, The Tonga Kid, and Jim Brunzell during the opening sequence of the 1986 fantasy film \"Highlander\", which occurs at a show in Madison Square Garden (although the scene was actually filmed at the Brendan Byrne Arena across the river).\n\n\nChampionship (1 time) – Hayes\n\n"}

He wrote commentaries on the hymns of the Salii (\"Carmen Saliare\"), and probably also on the \"Twelve Tables\". He analysed the authenticity of comedies supposedly by Plautus, and recognized 25 as canonical, four more than were allowed by Varro.\n\nIt is probable that he was the author of a general glossographical work, dealing with literary, historical and antiquarian questions.

{"id": "1873524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873524", "title": "Uterine myomectomy", "text": "Uterine myomectomy\n\nMyomectomy, sometimes also fibroidectomy, refers to the surgical removal of uterine leiomyomas, also known as fibroids. In contrast to a hysterectomy, the uterus remains preserved and the woman retains her reproductive potential.\n\nThe presence of a fibroid does not mean that it needs to be removed. Removal is necessary when the fibroid causes pain or pressure, abnormal bleeding, or interferes with reproduction. The fibroids needed to be removed are typically large in size, or growing at certain locations such as bulging into the endometrial cavity causing significant cavity distortion.\n\nTreatment options for uterine fibroids include observation or medical therapy, such a GnRH agonist), hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, and high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation.\n\nA myomectomy can be performed in a number of ways, depending on the location, size and number of lesions and the experience and preference of the surgeon. Either a general or a spinal anesthesia is administered.\n\nTraditionally a myomectomy is performed via a laparotomy with a full abdominal incision, either vertically or horizontally. Once the peritoneal cavity is opened, the uterus is incised, and the lesion(s) removed. The open approach is often preferred for larger lesions. One or more incisions may be set into the uterine muscle and are repaired once the fibroid has been removed. Recovery after surgery takes six to eight weeks.\n\nUsing the laparoscopic approach the uterus is visualized and its fibroids located and removed.\nStudies have suggested that laparoscopic myomectomy leads to lower morbidity rates and faster recovery than does laparotomic myomectomy. As with hysteroscopic myomectomy, laparoscopic myomectomy is not generally used on very large fibroids. A study of laparoscopic myomectomies conducted between January 1990 and October 1998 examined 106 cases of laparoscopic myomectomy, in which the fibroids were intramural or subserous and ranged in size from 3 to 10 cm.\n\nA fibroid that is located in a submucous position (that is, protruding into the endometrial cavity) may be accessible to hysteroscopic removal. This may apply primarily to smaller lesions as pointed out by a large study that collected results from 235 patients suffering from submucous myomas who were treated with hysteroscopic myomectomies; in none of these cases was the fibroid greater than 5 cm. However, larger lesions have also been treated by hysteroscopy. Recovery after hysteroscopic surgery is but a few days.\n\nComplications of the surgery include the possibility of significant blood loss leading to a blood transfusion, the risk of adhesion or scar formation around the uterus or within its cavity, and the possible need later to deliver via cesarean section.\n\nIt may not be possible to remove all lesions, nor will the operation prevent new lesions from growing. Development of new fibroids will be seen in 42-55% of patients undergoing a myomectomy.\n\nIt is well known that myomectomy surgery is associated with a higher risk of uterine rupture in later pregnancy. Thus, women who have had myomectomy (with the exception of small submucosal myoma removal via hysteroscopy, or largely pedunculated myoma removal) should get Cesarean delivery to avoid the risk of uterine rupture that is commonly fatal to the fetus.\n\nTo reduce bleeding during myomectomy, the use of misoprostol in the vagina and the injection of vasopressin into the uterine muscle are both effective. There is less evidence supporting the usefulness chemical dissection (such as with mesna), vaginal insertion of dinoprostone, a gelatin-thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, infusion of vitamin C, infiltration of a mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine into the uterine muscles, or the use of a fibrin sealant patch.\n\nLeiomyomata tend to grow during pregnancy but only the large ones causing endometrial cavity distortion could interfere with the growing pregnancy directly. Generally, surgeons tend to stay away from operative interventions during the pregnancy because of the risk of haemorrhage and the concern that the pregnancy may be interrupted. Also, after a pregnancy, myomas tend to shrink naturally. However, in selected cases myomectomy may become necessary during pregnancy, or also at the time of a caesarean section to gain access to the baby.\n"}

At only 14, the family published some poems, against his will - (he thought the poems were not good enough). In 1954, at the age of 16, Ary saw some of his poems being selected for the Anthology of the Almeida Garrett prize. After that, Ary fell out with his father and left his family home, working on several jobs, like errand boy, bubblegum and machines seller, tutor, docker, clerk and finally publicist. His poetic work continued to develop and in 1963 he published his first book, \"A Liturgia do Sangue\" [Liturgy of Blood].\n\n1969 was the year that changed Ary's life, as he liked to say. He became a member of the Portuguese Communist Party and quickly developed his revolutionary vein.\n\nAry dos Santos established himself as one of the best known poets of his time by virtue of his song-writing. Having a profound impact in the late 20-th century Portuguese music, Ary dos Santos authored more than 600 hundred lyrics, voiced by the most respected Portuguese singers such as Amalia Rodrigues, Simone de Oliveira, Carlos do Carmo, Paulo de Carvalho and Fernando Tordo.\n\nAry participated, under a pseudonym, in the 1969's RTP Song Contest, writing the lyrics of the winning song: \"A Desfolhada\", performed by Simone de Oliveira.\n\nDuring his career, Ary also wrote several revolutionary poems, for political intervention, about the Estado Novo regime's anti-democratic policies, the need for freedom and celebrating the post-revolutionary conquests, which led him to be called the poet of the revolution.\n\nAry dos Santos died at age 46 from cirrhosis.\n"}

{"id": "1873547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873547", "title": "Northleach", "text": "Northleach\n\nNorthleach is a market town in Northleach with Eastington civil parish in Gloucestershire, England. The town is in the valley of the River Leach in the Cotswolds, about northeast of Cirencester and east-southeast of Cheltenham. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,854.\n\nNorthleach seems to have existed by about AD 780, when one Ethelmund son of Ingold granted 35 \"tributarii\" of land to Gloucester Abbey. The abbey later granted estates including Northleach to Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester, probably in about 1058 when he had the abbey church rebuilt. In Ealdred was translated to York, taking the lordship of Northleach with him. The Domesday Book of 1086 assessed the manor of Northleach at 37 hides. In 1095 a later Archbishop of York, Thomas of Bayeux, restored manors including Northleach to Gloucester Abbey. His successors disputed this until 1157, when the claim was finally settled in the abbey's favour.\n\nIn 1539 Parliament passed the Suppression of Religious Houses Act, and in 1540 Gloucester Abbey was suppressed and surrendered its estates to the Crown. Northleach became a Royal manor and remained so until 1611, when James I sold it to George and Thomas Whitmore. By 1641 it had passed to their brother Sir Thomas Whitmore, 1st Baronet, of Apley, Shropshire. Sir Thomas was a Royalist, so in 1645 in the English Civil War the Parliamentarians sequestered his estates, but Northleach was given such a low valuation that he was allowed to keep it. Northleach stayed in his family until 1753, when William Whitmore sold it to James Lennox Dutton, who had inherited a number of houses in the town from his father. In 1771 his son John Lenox Dutton left Northleach to Rev. Richard Rice, Rector of Quenington. It then descended \"via\" Rice's son and was divided between his three granddaughters. Jevon Harper, husband of one of the three sisters, eventually obtained all three shares in the manor.\n\nBy 1863 the manor had passed to Rev. Richard Blanche, minister of Northleach's Congregational chapel. In 1870 and 1906 one Thomas Stephens held the manor. In 1914 it was held by one Charles Cole, who died in 1931, leaving it to Mrs Alice Cole.\n\nThe earliest record of the parish church is from about 1100. Little from this period survives in the current Church of England parish church of SS Peter and Paul except some Norman masonry in the west wall of the lady chapel. The next oldest part of the church is a 14th-century cusped doorway on the north side of the chancel.\n\nFrom the late 14th century the church was almost completely rebuilt in Perpendicular Gothic style. The west tower was built in about 1380–1400, and the font is also late 14th-century. The current nave and south porch were built in the first half of the 15th century, as was the pulpit. The nave has tall five-bay arcades with slender octagonal columns ornamented with concave sides. The nave clerestory was paid for by John Fortey, a wool merchant, who died in 1459. The lady chapel is south of the chancel, was completed in 1489 and has a squint to the high altar in the chancel.\n\nThe church was restored 1877–84 to designs by the Gothic Revival architect James Brooks. The chancel received a stained glass east window made by Alexander Gibbs in 1871. Little of Brooks' work at Northleach survives, except for his choir stalls in the north aisle. In 1920 a new high altar with riddel posts designed by FE Howard was installed in the chancel.\n\nIn 1961 a new restoration was begun, which includes seats designed by Sir Basil Spence and made by Gordon Russell. In the chancel Gibbs' 1871 east window was replaced by a modern one of Christ in Majesty made by Christopher Webb in 1963. The church is now a Grade I listed building. Its benefice is now combined with the parishes of Cold Aston, Compton Abdale, Farmington, Hampnett, Haselton, Notgrove and Turkdean.\n\nThe parish church has a number of monumental brasses. Most portray local wool merchants in civilian clothes with their wives: John Taylour (died 1400) and his wife Joane, Thomas Fortey (died 1447) with his wife Agnes and her first husband William Sors, John Fortey (died 1459), William Midwinter (died 1501) and his wife, Robert Serche (died 1501) and his wife Anne, Thomas Busshe (died 1526) and his wife Johane. In the chancel is a brass portraying a priest, William Lander (died 1530), in his Mass vestments.\n\nIn 1700 William and Robert Cor of Aldbourne, Wiltshire cast a ring of six bells for the west tower. In 1897, the year of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast a new treble and second bell to increase the ring to eight, and the enlarged ring was rehung. In 1922 the sixth (formerly the fourth) bell from 1700 was recast.\n\nThe church has been described by an authoritative arbiter as, \"next to Cirencester the most beautiful church in the Cotswolds\".\n\nDissenters were recorded in Northleach in the 17th and 18th centuries, and by 1796 a Congregationalist group established was meeting in a room in the town. A chapel for it was built at West End in 1798, with a burial ground that remained in use until the 1950s. The chapel was recorded in 1801 as sharing a minister with the chapel at Pancakehill in Chedworth, an arrangement that continued until about 1950. In 1851 the congregation numbered 80 and in 1860 a new chapel was built for it on the main street by the marketplace. In 1900 membership had declined to 28. In 1964 the chapel needed extensive repairs, so it was sold and converted into a house. For a while the congregation worshipped in the Cotswold Hall, but by 1969 it had so few members that it was meeting in a member's home.\n\nIn 1821 a group was recorded as meeting at Northleach who may have been Wesleyan Methodists. A small chapel for the group was built at Millend in 1827 and had a Sunday school by 1833. In 1851 the chapel's afternoon service had a congregation of 100 and its evening service had 117. The chapel was a member of the Cheltenham Circuit, and often members of the Cheltenham congregation walked each way on Sundays to conduct services at Northleach. Membership later declined, partly attracted by the new Congregational chapel opened in 1860, and the Wesleyan chapel was closed in 1883. The Primitive Methodists soon bought the chapel but their mission in Northleach was unsuccessful. By 1889 The Salvation Army had bought the chapel, but they too were unsuccessful. The Congregationalists had bought the former Wesleyan chapel by 1912 and used it as an institute until about 1923.\n\nIn 1219 or 1220 Gloucester Abbey founded the town as a borough with a charter to hold a regular market. The town is strategically placed on what used to be the main road between Oxford and Gloucester, just east of its junction with the Fosse Way Roman road. In the late Middle Ages the town prospered as a strategic centre for the wool trade.\n\nThe Oxford – Gloucester road was turnpiked in 1751, and by the 1770s it was the main road for both stagecoaches and mail coaches linking Gloucester and South Wales with London. Northleach became a staging post, with the King's Head became the main coaching inn, and by about 1820 the Sherborne Arms trying to win a share of the trade.\n\nIn 1841 the Cirencester Branch Line opened and the coach trade lost traffic to the Great Western Railway. A truncated coach service \"via\" Northleach then linked Gloucester and Cheltenham with Steventon railway station in what was then Berkshire, until in 1845 the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway completed the Golden Valley Line between and \"via\" . By 1853 Northleach's only remaining coach was a single service between Cheltenham and Oxford.\n\nProposals to build a railway \"via\" Northleach were brought forward through a Bill put to Parliament in 1860, however met with objections (chiefly from the Great Western Railway Company) and failed at the Committee Stage. In 1862 the Bourton-on-the-Water Railway opened, with its terminus at northeast of Northleach. In 1881 the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway was completed between Bourton and and opened a station at north of Northleach.\n\nThe Oxford – Cheltenham road ceased to be a turnpike in 1870. It has been classified as the A40 road since the 1920s, and later in the 20th century it was diverted north of the town by the building of a new bypass road, opening in 1984. Since the 1920s the Fosse Way between Cirencester and Halford, Warwickshire has been classified as the A429 road.\n\nIn 1962 British Railways closed and dismantled the line between Bourton and Cheltenham and withdrew passenger trains between Bourton and . In 1964 BR withdrew freight services from Bourton and dismantled the line between there and Kingham. Since then the nearest railway stations to Northleach have been Kemble on the Golden Valley Line and Kingham on the Cotswold Line between and . Kingham is nearer in a straight line, but each is about from Northleach by road.\n\nIn 1791 the House of Correction was built outside Northleach on land just west of Fosse Way. It was a new prison designed by the architect William Blackburn on principles advocated by the prison reformer Sir George Onesiphorus Paul. Petty sessions were held at the prison, serving a Petty sessional division whose extent was confirmed in 1836 as 25 parishes. By 1841 a detachment of the new Gloucestershire Constabulary was based at Northleach, and a women's wing was added to the prison in 1842. In 1857 the prison was reduced to holding only remand prisoners, and part of the building was converted into the police station. In 1859 part of the keeper's house was converted into the petty sessions court.\n\nParliament passed the Poor Law Amendment Act in 1834 and a poor law union based on Northleach was established in 1836. A workhouse was designed on a cruciform plan by George Wilkinson of Witney, Oxfordshire and built at the east end of the town.\n\nFrom 1846 a division of the Gloucester county court sat at Northleach, initially at the King's Head Inn. Under the Local Government Act 1894, a Northleach rural district was established in 1895 administering 29 local parishes. An electoral ward with the same name exists. The area and population of this ward are identical to that of the parish.\n\nIn 1936–37 the main cell blocks of the prison were demolished, the height of the perimeter wall was reduced and the building became the local police station. In 1972 the police moved to a new station in West End. The following year Northleach petty sessional division was merged with that of Stow-on-the-Wold, and all trials were moved there. In 1980 the surviving prison buildings were converted into a museum or rural life. They are now a Grade II* listed building.\n\nIn the late 1940s the workhouse was converted into a geriatric hospital. It was closed in 1987, sold, converted into a private nursing home and reopened as such in 1995. The County Court ceased sitting at Northleach in 1950. Under the Local Government Act 1972, Northleach Rural District Council was dissolved in 1974 and the area became part of the new Cotswold District Council.\n\nIn 1559 a bequest by wealthy landowner and sheep-farmer, Hugh Westwood of Chedworth, founded Northleach Grammar School. In 1560 a building on the corner of High Street and Conduit Street (now Farmington Road) was bought by the town to be the school building. In 1606 an Act of Parliament vested its patronage and rights of presentation in The Queen's College, Oxford. College House was built in the 17th century and extended in the late 18th or early 19th century. It was the headmaster's house and also lodged the boarding pupils. In 1877 it was reorganised under the Endowed Schools Acts of 1873 and 1874, and it had 30 pupils in 1885. It ran out of funds and was closed by its governors about 1904.\n\nIn 1927 a new, co-educational Westwood's Grammar School was built at the east end of the town. It later came under the administration of Gloucestershire County Council. In 1987 it had 305 pupils in 1987. In 1988 it was closed and its pupils were transferred to the Cotswold School at Bourton-on-the-Water. In 1989 the Westwood Educational Trust was established. Westwood's Grammar School has since been demolished and the Westwood Community Centre built on its site.\n\nA National School in Northleach was founded in 1831 and had 32 pupils in 1833. School buildings on a new site south of Millend were started in 1874 and completed the next year, when the school moved in with about 117 pupils. By 1897 it had been enlarged with capacity for 200 pupils, and average attendance was 144. In 1997 Northleach Church of England Primary School had 122 pupils.\n\nIt is one of the few Gloucestershire primary schools with its own outdoor swimming pool. The pool is open to the public for a small charge in the summer holidays.\n\nThe town has two pubs: The Sherborne Arms and The Wheatsheaf Inn. There are also a food takeaway, a butcher, a baker, art and antique dealers and other shops.\n\nNorthleach now has one museum. The former House of Correction is now the Old Prison museum and visitor centre, also called Escape to the Cotswolds. The World of Mechanical Music was a private enterprise that exhibited but closed in 2019 music boxes and other self-playing instruments. The building is now a private residence.\n\nNorthleach Town Football Club has two teams, both of which play in the Cheltenham Association Football League. Northleach Town Cricket Club has a first and second men's team, ladies' team and junior team. The first eleven played in the Cotswold District Cricket Association league until 2013, since which time it has played only friendly matches.\n\nNorthleach also has a sports and social club, darts, running, skittles, snooker and pool and tennis clubs. Most of the clubs use the Northleach Pavilion which is leased from the Town Council. Westwood Community Centre has facilities for a number of sports and community activities. The Snooker Club uses the ground floor of the Cotswold Hall which is located on West End, almost opposite the Wheatsheaf Inn.\n\nNorthleach has a coach link with Gloucester, Cheltenham, Burford and Oxford. It is route 853, run seven days a week by Swanbrook Services of Staverton. From Mondays to Fridays there are three journeys each way: two as far as Gloucester and one only as far as Cheltenham. On Saturdays there are four journeys each way: two as far as Gloucester and two only as far as Cheltenham. On Sundays and bank holidays there is only one journey each way.\n\nNorthleach has a bus link with Cheltenham, Charlton Kings, Andoversford, Sherborne, Clapton-on-the-Hill, Windrush and Little Barrington. It is run by Pulhams Coaches of Bourton-on-the-Water and is numbered 801 between Lechlade and Northleach but 809 between Northleach and Little Barrington.\n\nIn 1999, \"The Wyvern Mystery\", a BBC film was shot in Northleach. In 2002, \"The Gathering\" was shot in Northleach, taking over the entire market place with a fair and fake bomb explosion, upon release it went straight to DVD in several European countries, however it didn't make it to DVD in the UK until 2010. In Aug 2014, filming began for the BBC's adaptation of J. K. Rowling's \"The Casual Vacancy\" with the marketplace being transformed into the fictional town of Pagford. In 2015, filming started for \"You, Me and the Apocalypse\" a Sky 1 miniseries, the marketplace was again transformed to look like an apocalyptic version of a Suffolk village. In September 2016, BBC3 started filming \"This Country\", a mockumentary sitcom set in an anonymous Cotswolds village, first broadcast on BBC iPlayer. Filming of the first series took place over three weeks. In June 2017, the music video for \"Benz Truck\" by the now deceased American singer and rapper Lil Peep was released for his debut album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1. Several parts of the video were shot in Northleach; most notably outside the Northleach Church, as well as Russia and Los Angeles, California. As of November 2018, the video has garnered over one-hundred-million views on YouTube and forty-million listens on the streaming platform SoundCloud. Despite Lil Peep being filmed on the curiously named road \"All Alone\" in Northleach, it was a missed opportunity that he didn't find the nearby street known as \"The Peep\" immortalised in a painting of the Town by the renowned British artist, L S Lowry.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873579", "title": "Zaporizhia", "text": "Zaporizhia\n\nZaporizhia, Zaporizhzhia or Zaporizhzhya (, ; ), also known as Zaporozhye (; , ) and formerly as Alexandrovsk ( ; ), is a city in south-eastern Ukraine, situated on the banks of the Dnieper. It is the administrative centre of the Zaporizhia Oblast (region).\n\nZaporizhia is known for its island of Khortytsia and Dnieper Hydroelectric Station. It is also an important industrial centre producing steel, aluminium, aircraft engines, automobiles, transformers for substations, and other heavy industry goods.\n\nUntil 1921 the city bore the name of Aleksandrovsk after the name of a fortress that was a part of the Dnieper Defence Line of the Russian Empire. In 1921 the city name was changed to Zaporizhia (Zaporozhye).\n\nThe city's name \"Zaporizhia\" literally means the position of the city located \"beyond the rapids\" (later, in 1932 the rapids were flooded in order to build the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station).\n\nArchaeological finds show that about two or three thousand years ago Scythians lived around the modern city. Later, Khazars, Pechenegs, Kuman, Tatars and Slavs dwelt there. The trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks passed through the island of Khortytsia. These territories were called the \"Wild Fields\", because they were not under the control of any state (it was the land between the highly eroded borders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and the Ottoman Empire).\n\nIn 1552 Dmytro Vyshnevetsky erected wood-earth fortifications on the small island Little Khortytsia which is near the western shore of Khortytsia island. Archeologists consider these fortifications to be a prototype for the Zaporizhian Sich — the stronghold of the paramilitary peasant regiments of Cossacks.\n\nIn 1770 the fortress of Aleksandrovskaya () was erected and is considered to be the year of the foundation of Zaporizhia. As a part of the Dnieper Defence Line the fortress protected the southern territories of Russian Empire from Crimean Tatar invasions. It is uncertain in whose honour the fortress was named. Some believe that it was Aleksander Golitsyn, the general who served Catherine the Great. Other possibilities are Prince Aleksandr Vyazemskiy or Alexander Rumyantsev. In 1775, Russia and the Ottoman Empire signed the Küçük Kaynarca peace treaty, according to which the southern lands of the Russian Plain and Crimean peninsula became Russian-governed territories. As a result, the Aleksandrovskaya Fortress lost its military significance and converted into a small provincial rural town, known from 1806 under the name Alexandrovsk ().\n\nIn 1789, Mennonites from Danzig (Prussia) accepted the invitation from Catherine the Great to settle several colonies in the area of the modern city. The island of Khortitza was gifted to them for \"perpetual possession\" by the Russian government. In 1914, the Mennonites sold the island back to the city. The Mennonites built mills and agricultural factories in Alexandrovsk. During the Russian Revolution and especially by World War II most of the Mennonites had fled to North and South America as well as being forcefully relocated to eastern Russia. At present, few Mennonites live in Zaporizhia, although in the area many industrial buildings and houses built by Mennonites are preserved.\n\nIn 1829, it was proposed to build a cable ferry across the Dnieper. The ferry could carry a dozen carts. The project was approved by Tsar and later was used in other parts of the Russian Empire. In 1904 the ferry was replaced by the Kichkas Bridge, which was built in the narrowest part of the river called \"Wolf Throat\", near to the northern part of the Khortytsia Island.\n\nThe first railway bridge over the Dnieper was the Kichkas () Bridge, which was designed by Y.D. Proskuryakov and E. O. Paton. The construction works were supervised by F. W. Lat. The total bridge length was 336 meters. It crossed the river with a single span of 190 m. The upper tier carried a double-track railway line, whilst the lower tier was used for other types of vehicles; both sides of the bridge were assigned as footpaths. It was built at the narrowest part of the Dnieper river known as \"Wolf Throat\". Construction started in 1900, and it opened for pedestrian traffic in 1902. The official opening of the bridge was 17 April 1904, though railway traffic on the bridge only commenced on 22 January 1908. The opening of the Kichkas Bridge led to the industrial growth of Alexandrovsk.\n\nIn 1916, during the World War I, the aviation engines plant of DEKA Stock Association (today better known as the Motor Sich) was transferred from Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe Kichkas Bridge was of strategic importance during the Russian Civil War, and carried troops, ammunition, the wounded and medical supplies. Because of this bridge, Alexandrovsk and its environs was the scene of fierce fighting from 1918 to 1921 between the Red Army and the White armies of Denikin and Wrangel, Petliura and German-Austrian troops, and after their defeat, the struggle with insurgents led by Grigoriev and Makhno. The bridge was damaged a number of times. The most serious damage was inflicted by Makhno's troops when they retreated from Alexandrovsk in 1920 and blew a 40 m wide gap in the middle of the bridge.\n\nPeople's Commissar of Railways Dzerzhinsky of the Bolshevik government ordered the repair of the bridge. The metallurgical plant of (now Dneprovsky plant) in Dnipropetrovsk built a replacement section. The Kichkas Bridge reopened on 14 September 1921. On 19 October 1921, the Soviet Council of Labour and Defence (chaired by Lenin) awarded the Yekaterininsky railroad the Order of the Red Banner of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic for the early restoration of the Kichkas Bridge.\n\nAt the beginning of 20th century, Zaporizhia was a small unremarkable rural town of the Russian Empire, which acquired industrial importance during the industrialization carried out by the Soviet government in the 1920–1930th \nIn the 1929–1932 master plan for city construction was developed. At 10 km from the old town Alexandrovsk at the narrowest part of the Dnieper river was planned to build the hydroelectric power station, the most powerful in Europe at that time. Close to the station should be constructed the new modern city and a giant steel and aluminum plants. Later the station was named \"DnieproHES\", the steel plant – \"Zaporizhstal'\" (Zaporizhia Steel Plant), and the new part of the city – \"Sotsgorod\". (Socialist city)\nProduction of the aluminum plant (\"DAZ\"- Dnieper Aluminium Plant) according to the plan should exceed the overall production of the aluminum all over Europe at that time.\n\nState Institute for Design of Metallurgical Plants (GIPROMEZ) developed a project of creation of the Dnieper Industrial Complex. GIPROMEZ consulted with various companies, including the Freyn Engineering Company of Chicago (USA), which participated in the design and construction of the blast furnaces.\n\nIn the 1930s the American United Engineering and Foundry Company built a strip mill, which produced hot and cold rolling steel strip. This was a copy of the Ford River Rouge steel mill. Annual capacity of the mill reached 600,000 tons. Strip width was 66 inches. There was a second section that used a Soviet copy of the Demag AG strip mill that produced 45 inch wide strip steel.\n\nThe turning point in the history of the city was the construction of the hydro-electric dam (DniproHES), which began in 1927 and completed in 1932. The principal designer of the project was I. G. Alexandrov, the construction manager – A. V. Vinter, the chief architect – V. A. Vesnin and the chief American advisor – the colonel Hugh Cooper. According to the project, the installed generating capacity was 560 megawatts, the length of a convex dam was 760 m, the width – 56 m, the height – 60 m. Eight turbines and five electrical generators were designed and manufactured in the United States; the other three generators were made at the Leningrad factory Electrosila.\nAs a result of the commissioning of the station The Dnieper rapids were flooded, and the river became navigable from Kiev to Kherson. In 1980, in addition, a new generator building was built, and the station power was increased to 1.388 megawatts\n\nBetween the hydroelectric dam and industrial area in 10 km from the center of the old Alexandrovsk was established residential district No. 6, which was named \"Sotsgorod\". In 20th doctrinaire idealistic enthusiasm of the architects was reflected in the intense debate about the habitation of the socialist community. The architects believed that by using new architectural forms they could create a new society. District No. 6 was one of the few implementations of urban development concepts. The construction of the district began in 1929 and finished in 1932. The main idea guiding the architects was the creation of the garden city, the city of the future. Multi-storey houses (not more than 4 floors) with large, roomy apartments were built in Sotsgorod with spacious yards planted with grass and trees around the buildings.\nNikolai Kolli, V.A.Vesnin, G.M.Orlov, V.G.Lavrov and others designed the DniproHES and SotsGorod. Le Corbusier visited the town few times in the 1930s. The architects used the ideas of the constructivist architecture.\n\nThe ring house the building No. 31 at Independent Ukraine Street (formerly – 40 years of Soviet Ukraine Street) was designed by V.G. Lavrov. Families of the Soviet and American engineers, advisors, and industry bosses lived in Sotsgorod at that time. However, the most of the workers during the construction of the hydro-power station and plants lived in dugouts at No. 15 and Aluminum districts. The south border of the Sotsgorog is limited by Verkhnya Ulitsa (Upper Street) and north border – by the hydroelectric power station. At the intersection between Sobornyi Avenue and Verkhnya Street, architect I.L. Kosliner set a tower with seven stories. This tower supposedly indicates the entrance gate of Sotsgorod from the south (from Alexandrovsk). Closer to the dam, the second tower was raised (architects I.L. Kosliner and L.Ya. Gershovich). Both towers point out a straight line of the central street of the district.\n\nThe names of the streets have changed several times. The original name of Metallurgist Avenue was Enthusiasts Alley. This road leads to the factories. At that time, they believed that people going to the plant had only positive feelings like joy, pride, and enthusiasm. At the end of the road stands a 1963 sculpture of the metallurgist by sculptor Ivan Nosenko. During the German occupation, it was named Shevchenko Avenue. Later it was renamed Stalin Avenue; and after his death, it got the present name of Metallurgist Avenue. Sobornyi Avenue originally had the name Libkhnet Avenue. \"Forty Years of Soviet Ukraine\" Street was once called Sovnarkomovska Street and during the German occupation Hitler Alley.\n\nBig Zaporizhia\n\nDistrict No. 6 is a small part of the global project called \"Big Zaporizhia\". This project was designed for the city, to enable a half-million people to live in seven different areas: Voznesenka, Baburka, Kichkas, Alexandrovsk, Pavlo-Kichkas, Island Khortitsa, and (omitted). Each district must be independent of the others and yet part of а united city. The city line should be stretched along the banks of the Dnieper River for 22 km.\n\nThe location of the Kichkas Bridge was in the flood zone upstream of the hydroelectric dam. Initially, it was planned to disassemble it and rebuild it in another location. But expert advice was that this was not cost-effective as it was cheaper to build a new bridge.\n\nThe building of the hydroelectric dam meant that a new bridge was required to take the railway over the Dnieper. Instead of having a single bridge, as before, it was decided to take the railway over the island Khortytsia. The wide part of the river between Khortytsia and the city is known as the New Dnieper, and the narrower part between Khortytsia and the suburbs on the right bank of the river is known as the Old Dnieper. The New Dnieper was crossed by a three-arch two-tier bridge. Each of the arches spans 140 m. When the approach spans are included the total length is 715 m weighing 8,480 tons. The Old Dnieper was crossed by a single-span arch bridge with a total length of 370 m; the arch spans of 224 m and was then the largest single-span bridge in Europe. This bridge weighed 5,220 tons. Both bridges were designed by Professor Streletsky. They were made of riveted steel, and had two tiers: the upper tier for rail traffic and the lower tier for road traffic and pedestrians. They were assembled by a combination of Czechoslovakian and Soviet workers under the direction of a Soviet engineer named Konstantinov. The arches are steel made by the Vitkovetskom steel plant in Czechoslovakia, other steelwork was made at the Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Plant. The new bridges opened on 6 November 1931. The Kichkas Bridge was demolished afterwards.\n\nThe War between the USSR and Nazi Germany began on 22 June 1941. \n\nAfter the outbreak of the war, the Soviet government started the evacuation of the industrial equipment from the city to Siberia . The Soviet security forces NKVD shot political prisoners in the city. On 18 August 1941, elements of the German 1st Panzergruppe reached the outskirts of Zaporizhia on the right bank and seized the island Khortytsia.\n\nThe Red Army blew a 120m x 10m hole in the Dnieper hydroelectric dam (DniproHES) at 16:00 on 18 August 1941, producing a flood wave that swept from Zaporizhia to Nikopol, killing local residents as well as soldiers from both sides. \"Since no official death toll was released at the time, the estimated number of victims varies widely. Most historians put it at between 20,000 and 100,000, based on the number of people then living in the flooded areas\". After two days, the city defenders received reinforcements, and held the left bank of the river for 45 days. During this time people dismantled heavy machinery, packed and loaded them on the railway platform, marked and accounted for with wiring diagrams. Zaporizhstal alone exported 9,600 railway cars with the equipment. Zaporizhia was taken on 3 October 1941.\n\nThe German occupation of Zaporizhia lasted 2 years and 10 days. During this time the Germans shot over 35,000 people, and sent 58,000 people to Germany as forced labour. The Germans used forced labor (mostly POWs) to try to restore the Dnieper hydroelectric dam and the steelworks. Local citizens established an underground resistance organization in spring 1942.\n\nThe Krivoy Rog – Stalingrad and Moscow – Crimea railway lines through Zaporizhia were important supply lines for the Germans in 1942–43, but the big three-arch Dnieper railway bridge at Zaporizhia was blown up by the retreating Red Army on 18 August 1941, with further demolition work done during September 1941. and the Germans did not bring it back into operation until summer 1943. \"As a result all goods had to be reloaded and tank-wagons carrying petrol could not go through to the front.\"\n\nWhen the Germans reformed Army Group South in February 1943, it had its headquarters in Zaporizhia. The loss of Kharkiv and other cities caused Adolf Hitler to fly to this headquarters on 17 February 1943, where he stayed until 19 February and met the army group commander Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, and was persuaded to allow Army Group South to fight a mobile defence that quickly led to much of the lost ground being recaptured by the Germans in the Third Battle of Kharkov. Hitler visited the headquarters in Zaporizhia again on 10 March 1943, where he was briefed by von Manstein and his air force counterpart Field Marshal Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen. Hitler visited the headquarters at Zaporizhia for the last time on 8 September 1943. In mid-September 1943 the Army Group moved its headquarters from Zaporizhia to Kirovograd (now called Kropyvnytskyi).\n\nBoth the big railway bridge over the New Dnieper and the smaller one over the Old Dnieper were damaged in an air raid by a group of eight Ilyushin Il-2s led by Lieutenant A Usmanov on 21 September 1943.\n\nIn mid-August 1943, the Germans started building the Panther-Wotan defence line along the Dnieper from Kiev to Crimea, and retreated back to it in September 1943. The Germans held the city as a bridgehead over the Dnieper, with elements of 40th Panzer and 17th Corps. The Soviet Southwestern Front, commanded by Army General Rodion Malinovsky, attacked the city on 10 October 1943. Whilst the defenders held against the attacks, the Red Army reinforced its troops and launched a surprise night attack at 22:00 on 13 October, \"laying down a barrage of shellfire bigger than anything... seen to date (it was here that entire 'divisions' of artillery appeared for the first time) and throwing in no fewer than ten divisions strongly supported by armour\", the Red Army broke into the bridgehead forcing the Germans to abandon it on 14 October. The retreating Germans destroyed the Zaporizhstal steel plant almost completely; they demolished the big railway bridge again, and demolished the turbine building and damaged 32 of the 49 bays of the Dnieper hydro-electric dam. The city has a street between Voznesenskyi and Oleksandrivskyi Districts and a memorial in Oleksandrivskyi District dedicated to Red Army Lieutenant Yatsenko who commanded the tank, which first entered the city; he and his crew were killed in the battle for the city.\n\nThe Red Army did not recapture the parts of the city on the right bank until 1944.\n\nThe rebuilding of the Dnieper hydro-electric dam commenced on 7 July 1944; the first electricity was produced from the restored dam on 3 March 1947.\n\nThe automobile transport connection between the right shore city districts and city centre via the Preobrazhensky bridge was already congested in the late nineties. In 2004, construction began on new bridges across the Dnieper. These bridges are parallel to the existing Preobrazhensky bridge at a short distance downstream. Construction of the bridges halted soon after it began, and remain untouched due to lack of funding. The project design is dated and needs revising, and the cost of the bridge is estimated to reach 8 billion hryvnias (as opposed to the original 2 billion).\n\nDuring the 2014 Euromaidan regional state administration occupations protests against President Viktor Yanukovych were also held in Zaporizhia. On 23 February 2014 Zaporizhia's regional state administration building was occupied by 4,500 protesters, Mid-April 2014 there were clashes between Ukrainian activists and pro-Russians. The Ukrainian activists outnumbered the pro-Russian protesters.\n\nIn the year of the fall of the Russian Empire (1917), the population of Alexandrovsk was about 60,000 people. In the year of the fall of the Soviet Union (1992), the city's population reached almost 1 million people. In 70 years, a small rural town turned into a large industrial, cultural and scientific center. In other words, the modern city was created in times of socialism and as a result, after 19 May 2016, when the Ukrainian parliament issued Law No. 275, which Ukrainians briefly called as the \"Decommunization Law\", the city council is forced to rename more than 50 main streets and the names of the administrative parts of the city, the monuments of the Soviet Union leaders (Lenin, Felix Dzerzhinsky) were destroyed. The names in honor of the others the Soviet leaders in the titles of the plants, factories, culture centers DniproHES were also removed.\n\nThe city is located in south-eastern Ukraine. The Dnieper river splits the city for two parts between them is located the Khortytsia island. The city covers 334 km at an elevation of 50 m above sea level.\n\nTwo streams around Khortytsia island are called the New and Old Dnieper. The New Dnieper is about 800 m (2600 feet) wide and the Old Dnieper is about 200 m (650 feet). The island has sizes. There are also several small rivers in the city, which enter the Dnieper: Sukha and Mokra Moskovka, Kushuhum, and Verkhnia Khortytsia.\n\nThe flora of Khortytsia island is unique and diverse due to the dry steppe air and a large freshwater basin around, which cleans the polluted by industries air. Khortytsia Island is a national park. The island surface is cut by large ravines (\"balka\"), hiking routes and historical monuments. The island is a very popular recreational area for both kids and adults. There are a large number of sanatoriums, resorts and health centers. The comfortable sand beaches for swimming and other water activities are present here as well:\nZaporizhia is a regional seat of Zaporizhia Oblast and a city of regional significance meaning that it has a form of self-rule within the oblast (region).\n\nThe city is divided into 7 administrative raions.\n\nThe city population has been permanently declined since the first years of the state independence. In 2014–2015 the rate of the population decrease was −0.56%/year.\n\nIn January 2017, the city population equaled 750,685 inhabitants\nTotal reduction of the population of the city during the state independence was around 146 thousand people ( 2017–2018 years are not included in this estimation)\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, Zaporizhia had the following ethnic structure:\n\nZaporizhia residents speak mostly in Russian in the city itself but in the peripheral towns and villages Ukrainian language is dominant. For official government business Ukrainian is used.\n\nThe following religious denominations are present in Zaporizhia:\n\nMost of the citizens are Orthodox Christians of Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) or newly created Orthodox Church of Ukraine. Among of the Orthodox churches the Church of the Intercession, which is under the Moscow Patriarchate, is most popular. There are also St. Nicholas Church and St. Andrew's Cathedral in the city.\n\nProtestantism is represented by:\n\nCatholicism is represented by:\nThe biggest Catholic church is Church of God, the Father of Mercy\n\nOrthodox Judaism is represented by one union and six communities.\n\nIn the Zaporizhia district there are five communities which are part of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Ukraine and four independent Muslim communities.\n\nThe city hosts a branch of the Vedic Academy.\n\nZaporizhia is an important industrial center of Ukraine, the country's main car manufacturing company, the Motor-Sich world-famous aircraft engine manufacturer. Well supplied with electricity, Zaporizhia forms, together with the adjoining Donets Basin and the Nikopol manganese and Kryvyi Rih iron mines, one of Ukraine's leading industrial complexes.\n\nThe city is also a home of the Ukraine's main automobile production center which is based at the Zaporizhia Automobile Factory ZAZ producing such Ukrainian car brands like \"Zaporozhets\" and \"Tavria\".\n\nAfter the end of the Russian Revolution, the city became an important industrial center. The presence of cheap labor and the proximity of deposits of coal, iron ore, and manganese created favorable conditions for large-scale enterprises of the iron and mechanical engineering industries. Today Zaporizhia is an important industrial center of the region with heavy industry (particularly metallurgy), aluminium, and chemical industry. In the city cars, avia motors, radioelectronics are manufactured. The port of Zaporizhia is an important place of transshipment for goods from the Donbas.\n\nZaporizhstal, Ukraine's fourth largest steel maker, ranks 54th in the world and is based in the city.\n\nZaporizhia is a large electricity generating hub. There are hydroelectric power plant known as \"DniproHES\" Dnieper Hydroelectric Station and the largest in Europe nuclear power plant. Zaporizhia plants generate about 25% of the whole Ukrainian electricity consumption. The Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant is located near the Enerhodar (trans. Energygifter), around 60 km from Zaporizhia which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Also in Enerhodar, is the Zaporizhia Thermal Power Station.\n\nZaporizhia has a philharmonic, few museums, theaters, libraries. Among them are:\n\nThere are a number of small amateur groups of folk music bands, art galleries in Zaporizhia. The city regularly holds festivals and feasts, competitions of the Cossack martial arts and art exhibitions.\n\nZaporizhia has an open-air exhibition-and-sale of Zaporizhia city association of artists «Kolorit» near the 'Fountain of Life' at the Mayakovskoho square. A daily exhibition of artists' organizations of the city is a unique place in Zaporizhia, where people can communicate with craftsmen and artists, watch classes of carving, embroidery, beading and other creative works, receive lessons from professional artists, designers, and cartoonists.\n\nThe x island Khortytsia is located in the geographical center of the city. The city embraces the island by banks of the New and Old Dnieper streams.\nTwo concrete bridges connect the Island to the city.\nThey have been designed and constructed by the engineer Boris N. Preobrazhensky in 1952. Two level bridges have height about 54 meters. High level of the bridges is intended for rail and bottom – for cars and pedestrians.\nThe historical and cultural museum \"Zaporizhian Sich\" is placed on the northern rocky part of the island Khotritsa.\nThe museum is the reconstructed stronghold of the Zaporizhian Cossacks. All features of the military cossack's camp life and their lifestyle are presented in the museum.\n\nThe smaller islands are located between the dam and the island Khortytsia. Each of these islands has its own legend. On one of them named Durnya Scala (Rock of the Fool) Tzar Peter the Great punished the Cossacks by flogging for their betrayal on the side of Charles XII of Sweden during the Great Northern War between Russia and Sweden.\n\nThe another small island, named Stolb (Pillar), has a geological feature, which looks like a large bowl in granite slabs, its diameter equals 1,4 м, the depth – 1 м. This bowl is named Cossack's bowl. People say that in summer days under the hot sun, it is easy to boil water in this \"bowl\" and the Cossacks used it for cooking galushki\n\nThe panoramic view of the DnieproHES from Khortytsia island is very impressive.\nThe straight and long Sobornyi avenue (10 km) ends in the SotsGorod near the Dam, which built up of the constructivist architecture of the 20th century.\n\nThe city of Zaporizhia is an important transportation hub in Ukraine and has deeply developed transportation system that includes roadway, rail, river and air options for passenger, freight as well as public utilities transit. Public city transport includes buses, minivans, trams, trolleybuses and railways.\n\nOn the eastern outskirts of Zaporizhia passes a major national highway M-18 that connects Kharkiv with Simferopol. Three other national highways terminate in Zaporizhia, one H-23 which starts in Kropyvnytskyi and through Kryvyi Rih ends in Zaporizhia; the second H-08 which starts in Kiev and travels along Dnieper all the way south passing through number of important cities such as Kremenchuk, Kamianske, Dnipro, and others; and the other highway H-15 which arrives to Zaporizhia from Donetsk.\n\nThere are four road bridges over Dnieper and two rail bridges. All bridges but one connect the city with Khortytsia island. The other bridge goes over the river dam of DniproHES.\n\nThe Zaporizhia city has two railway stations, Zaporizhia-the-First and Zaporizhia-the-Second. The First is the central station. It is located in the southern part of the city and is a part of the \"north-south\" transit route Simferopol-Kharkiv. The line of the Zaporizhia-the-Second station connects the Donbas coalfield with Kryvyi Rih iron ore site.\n\nThe city's two river ports are part of the national water transportation infrastructure that connects Kiev to Kherson along Dnieper river and utilizes some freight ships as well as cutter boats to travel between Zaporizhia and nearby villages. The large island of Khortytsia splits the Dnieper into two branches (channels) the main branch that passes the island on its eastern side and the alternative branch also known as \"Staryi Dnipro\" (Old Dnieper) that flows past the island on its western side.\n\nThe city's sole airport that is located to the east of the city (left-bank of Dnieper) includes both domestic and international flights. To the west of the city (right-bank of Dnieper) is located smaller airfield Shyroke.\n\nZaporizhia is an important setting in two Axis victory in World War II short fictions by Harry Turtledove: \"Ready for the Fatherland\" (1991) and \"The Phantom Tolbukhin\" (1998). Turtledove always uses the Zaporozhye spelling.\n\nZaporizhia has an agreement about sister city relations with:\nIn addition, in 1969 the city renamed one of its streets \"Wrocław\", the Wrocław communist government acknowledging that they should honour the Ukrainian city in a similar way and a part of the Sudecka – Grabiszyńska street towards the square of the Silesian Insurgents – was renamed to Zaporoska street. It is about 1.3 km long.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873581", "title": "Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant", "text": "Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant\n\nRinghals is a nuclear power plant in Sweden. It is situated on the Värö Peninsula (Swedish: Väröhalvön) in Varberg Municipality approximately 65 km south of Gothenburg. With a total power rating of 3,055 MWe, it is the largest power plant in Sweden and generates 23 TWh of electricity a year, the equivalent of 15% of the electrical power usage of Sweden. It is owned 70% by Vattenfall and 30% by Uniper SE.\n\nThe plant has 3 operating reactors: one boiling water reactor (R1) and two pressurized water reactors (R3 and R4). A third pressurized water reactor, R2, was permanently shut off in 2019.\n\nPlanning and land procurement of the site started 1965. 2 reactors were ordered 1968, one boiling water reactor from ABB-ATOM (R1) and one pressurized water reactor from Westinghouse (R2). Construction work started 1969, and commercial operation started for R2 1975, and for R1 1976.\n\n2 more pressurized water reactors, R3 and R4, were ordered from Westinghouse 1971 and construction work started 1972.\n\nSo far the public and political opinion in Sweden was fairly positive to nuclear power. One reason was that until 1970 nearly all electricity came from a continuously increasing exploitation of the large and wild rivers in the north of Sweden, and the diminishing number of remaining, unexploited rivers created fierce opposition against further hydro power development.\n\nOpinion changed and in the parliamentary election 1976 a new government went into force with a clear agenda to phase out nuclear power no later than 1985. Formally this was imposed through a new law, which required proof of an \"absolute safe\" method for disposal of spent nuclear fuel before new reactors were allowed to be loaded with fresh nuclear fuel. The law went into force spring 1977 and hindered the recently completed unit R3 from being loaded with nuclear fuel. Swedish nuclear industry then developed a concept for disposal of high-level radioactive waste called KBS-1, later further developed to KBS-3.\n\nBased upon the KBS-1 concept R3 was, through a highly controversial process including a governmental crisis, granted permission to load fuel 27 March 1979. The TMI-accident occurred the following day which triggered a referendum about nuclear power. The referendum was held 23 March 1980 and the result was interpreted as a \"yes\" to completion of construction and operation of the whole Swedish nuclear program with 12 reactors. Hence R3 could be loaded with fuel and started commercial operation 9 September 1981 more than 4 years after essentially completed the construction phase 1977.\n\nR4 was also somewhat delayed due to the referendum but also due to remediation of some technical problems identified at the start-up of the sister-plant R3, and started commercial operation 21 November 1983.\n\nAs a result of the TMI-accident 1979 all Swedish reactors were required to install FCVS - Filtered Containment Venting System - and ICSS - Independent Containment Spray System. In case of an accident with core degradation and loss of all cooling systems the ICSS can still limit the containment pressure, and should this fail the FCVS can relieve the containment pressure with limited releases of radioactivity. The systems went into operation in Barsebäck 1985 and for the other plants 1989.\n\nAs a result of the Barsebäck strainer incident 1992 the recirculation strainer capacity was significantly increased for R1 1992 and R2 1994. Unit R3 and R4 made similar upgrades 2005.\n\nDuring the period 2005-2015 significant improvements were made especially for the older plants R1 and R2 regarding fire separation, redundancy and diversification of various safety systems.\n\nThe original steam generators for the Ringhals PWRs had tubes of Inconel-600 and details in the construction that made them prone to cracks and corrosion. This triggered huge efforts for inspection, maintenance and repair. Although designed for 40 years of operation, both unit R2 and R3 replaced their steam generators after 14 years, i.e. 1989 and 1995. Unit R4, starting later, could take advantage of being aware of the problems, and due to high attention to water chemistry and maintenance efforts the R4 steam generators were replaced 2011 after 28 years of operation. All the new steam generators have tubes of Inconel-690 and improved design, and have had very few problems and high availability. This is especially true for R2 which have (2017) been operating 28 years with the new steam generators.\n\nAs a result of analysis and observations from the TMI-accident the Ringhals PWR reactors installed PAR - Passive Autocatalytic hydrogen Recombiners in 2007. Each reactor contains a number of PAR units with catalytic plates, which after a severe core degradation can process the hydrogen emanating from the fuel cladding oxidation within a few hours and hence reduce the risk for violent hydrogen combustion.\n\nAll European nuclear power plants including Ringhals had to perform stress-tests after the Fukushima accident 2011, where consequences of certain beyond-design-events should be assessed. The availability of FCVS - Filtered Containment Venting System, ICSS - Independent Containment Spray System and PAR - Passive Autocatalytic hydrogen Recombiners, turned out to be valuable capabilities in these beyond-design-events and no immediate plant modifications were proposed as a post-Fukushima-response. On the contrary Ringhals made significant upgrades in the emergency preparedness organization in the size, education and training of the staffing, and in the independence and durability (power supply, communications, etc) for certain systems and buildings.\n\nIn December 2014, the Swedish regulator required that all Swedish reactors should be equipped with an Independent Core Cooling System - ICCS - before 31 December 2020. The system should be able to cool the reactor during 72 hours without any supply of water, power, fuel or other consumables, and should survive external events (seismic events, hard weather etc) with an estimated probability of exceedance of 10/yr. The requirements are influenced by the so called \"Forsmark-event\" 25 July 2006 and the Fukushima accident. Design of and preparations for ICCS is (2017) already underway for R3 and R4, but will not be made for R1 and R2 since they will be shut down before 2021.\n\nFollowing a number of observations of deficiencies in the safety culture since 2005, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority decided in 2009 to put Ringhals under increased surveillance. Ringhals made certain efforts in order to improve traceability and transparency in decision making, internal audits and analyses of incidents and mistakes. The regulator acknowledged the improvements, and the increased surveillance was waived 2013.\n\nIn 2012 a small amount of explosive, although without any firing device, was found during a routine check underneath a truck at the plant. For a short time all nuclear power plants in Sweden increased their alert level, but no more explosives were found, and no one could be tied to the finding.\n\nIn October 2012, 20 anti-nuclear Greenpeace activists scaled the outer perimeter standard industrial fence, and there was also an incursion at Forsmark nuclear power plant. Greenpeace said that its non-violent actions were \"intended to protest against the continuing operation of these reactors, which it argues were shown to be unsafe in European stress tests.\" The inner perimeter fence (with barbered wire, CCTV-surveillance, \"no-go\" zone etc) around the reactors was not scaled.\n\nOn 30 July 2018, Ringhals-2 was taken offline during the 2018 European heat wave, since the sea water temperature exceeded the design limit 25 DegC. The reactor was restarted on 3 August. The other reactors R1, R3 and R4 were not affected since they are licensed for slightly higher temperatures.\n\nIn October 2015, Vattenfall decided to close down Ringhals 1 by 2020 and Ringhals 2 by 2019 due to their declining profitability, instead of, as previously announced, around 2025. Ringhals 3 and 4 are still expected to continue in service until the 2040s.\n\nIn January 2016, Vattenfall announced that all its Swedish nuclear power plants, including the newer reactors, were operating at a loss due to low electricity prices and Sweden's nuclear power tax (\"effektskatt\"). It warned that it may be forced to shut all the nuclear plants down, and argued that the nuclear output tax, which constituted over 1/3 of the price, should be scrapped. Through an agreement 10 June 2016 the major part of the nuclear power tax was removed 1 July 2017, but combined with prolonged and enhanced support for renewable electricity production. The removal of the nuclear power tax corresponds to a tax reduction of approximately 7 öre or 0.007 EUR/kWh which corresponds to maybe 1/4th of the generating cost. This is a significant cost reduction and has been important for Vattenfall's decision to operate R3 and R4 until the 2040s.\n\nOn 2019-12-30, the R2 reactor was permanently shut off.\n\n"}

A member of the House of Yngling from the \"Ynglinga saga\", he was the son of Gudrød the Hunter and according to the late \"Heimskringla\", a half-brother of Halfdan the Black. Gudrød and Olaf ruled a large part of Raumarike.\n\nIn the \"Ynglinga saga\" portion of the \"Heimskringla,\" the king is reported to have died of a \"disease in his foot\" (\"fótarverkr\") or gout, although the \"Flateyjarbók\" suggests the king succumbed to a plague .\n\nThe \"Ynglinga saga\" also inserts the following verse by Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (original author of the \"Ynglingatal\"):\n\nOlaf was worshipped after his death as an \"elf\", and was called the \"Geirstad-alf\" (the \"elf of Geirstad\"). The account of this is recorded in the \"Þáttr Ólafs Geirstaða Alfs\" in the Flateyjarbók version of \"Óláfs saga helga\", and continues with a fantastical story of how he became a drow (\"draugr\") haunting his own (\"\", or grave-mound), but instructed to be destroyed so he can be reborn as Olaf the Saint.\n\nAccording to this version, Olaf was carried away by a plague that subsided after his death. Olaf had instructed his people to build a howe and lay him to rest inside, forbidding them to worship him after his death seeking propitious boon. But as Olaf suspected, once the next famine arrived, \"they resorted to the plan of sacrificing to King Olaf for plenty, and they called him Geirstaðaálfr\".\n\nLater, the spirit of Olaf appears in a dream to a man named Hrani, who is instructed to break into the howe, salvage the ring, with the sword named Besing (Bæsingr) and a belt which are to be presented to Queen Ásta for her future son. The man was also bidden to sever the head of the drow though making sure the head was set straight on its neck in the beheading process. The man does as instructed, and the queen gives birth to the future Olaf the Saint. Later on as Olaf the Saint is riding by the howe, one of his men remember him saying he had once been laid to rest there. The king vehemently denies this, saying his soul could not occupy two bodies. Davidson suggest the notion of rebirth is communicated here. At any rate, Olaf the Saint is thought to be eponymously named after Olaf Geirstad-Alf.\n\nThat the king came to be called an \"elf\" should not be taken too literally. Vigfusson and Powell discusses Olaf's rite and other example under the topical heading of \"Ancestor Worship\" and notes that in these instances, \"the dead were called 'Elves'\". H. R. E. Davidson gives a more extensive summary under the chapter \"The Cult of the Dead\", and notes that as for the animated corpse that he had become inside his grave-mound, \"the usual word for him is draugr\".\n\nA current hypothesis identifies Geirstad with Gjerstad near Gokstadhaugen and links Olaf's burial with the Gokstad Ship. This theory is unproven at present.\n\n"}

In 2016, Crabb was briefly Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. He has previously been a government whip, a junior minister for Wales and the Secretary of State for Wales.\n\nAlthough born in Inverness, to a Scottish mother, Crabb's upbringing was mostly in Haverfordwest, the county town of Pembrokeshire in Wales.\n\nHis father began claiming long-term sickness benefit – known then as Invalidity Benefit – the year before Crabb was born. His mother separated from his father when Crabb was eight years old. She raised him and his two brothers on a council estate, living on benefits and receiving help from family, friends and the Baptist church.\n\nCrabb has said that his early experiences informed his views on welfare: \"The most powerful thing to me, looking back, is the way that my mother went through a crisis in her life and became welfare-dependent. She started working just a few hours each week, increasing her hours and then moving to a position where with extra training she was able to move into full-time work, become a car owner, and reach full economic independence.\" He also said: \"I was brought up in a home where a huge amount of emphasis was put on work...so work and education as routes out of poverty were drummed into us\".\n\nCrabb was educated at local primary schools. From 1984-1991 he attended Tasker Milward School in Haverfordwest, created in 1978 after the closure of a former boys' grammar school and the local girls school, and which was a voluntary controlled school. He has said the education there was \"second to none...I tasted [the] very best of what a state education can provide\".\n\nCrabb went on to study politics at the University of Bristol and graduated in 1995. He joined the Conservative Party after graduating from university. Later, he gained an MBA at the London Business School.\n\nUpon graduating from university, Crabb took an unpaid post as a Christian Action Research and Education parliamentary intern.\n\nIn 1996, he became the Parliamentary Affairs Officer for the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services. In 1998, he served as an election monitor in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and started working as a policy manager at the London Chamber of Commerce. In 2002, he became a marketing consultant.\n\nIn 1998, whilst living in London, Crabb was elected as the chairman of the Southwark North and Bermondsey Conservative Association, a position he held until 2000.\n\nCrabb stood for Parliament in the constituency where he grew up, Preseli Pembrokeshire, in 2001. He finished in second place, but at the 2005 general election, he gained the seat from Labour with a majority of 607 votes, becoming one of three Welsh Conservative MPs who ended the \"Tory free zone\" that had existed in Wales since 1997. Crabb was the youngest member of the 2005 Conservative intake. He made his maiden speech on 25 May 2005.\n\nAt the 2010 general election, Crabb retained his seat with a majority of 4,605 votes, and 42.79% of the vote. In the general election on 7 May 2015, Crabb retained his seat with a majority of 4,969 votes and 40.4% of the vote.\n\nIn 2010, Crabb chaired the cross-party group for Democracy in Burma and was patron of the Burma Campaign UK. The Conservative Party website describes Crabb as someone who \"takes a strong interest in international development and believes firmly in the importance of UK aid\". From 2010 until 2012, he led the Conservative Party's Project Umubano, which works in Rwanda and Sierra Leone.\n\nCrabb has served on the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, the International Development Select Committee and the Treasury Select Committee. He was appointed to the Conservative front bench in 2009 as Junior Whip; when the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition was elected in 2010, Crabb was made Assistant Government Whip.\n\nDuring the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal, it was reported that Crabb had claimed £8,049 for refurbishments to his flat in London that was carried out from July 2006. He sold the flat the following year and switched his second home expenses to the house he had recently bought for his family in Pembrokeshire, allowing him to claim back £9,300 in stamp duty and £1,325 a month in mortgage interest for almost a year while designating another London flat he was renting with a fellow MP as his main home. Crabb said in response: \"I haven't claimed for things like plasma TVs, even though the rules allow it. My claims were always within the letter and the spirit of the rules\".\n\nIn 2012, Crabb was promoted to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales and became a Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, meaning he was a government minister and a government whip at the same time, which the BBC said had led to \"political pundits and opposition politicians scratching their heads\". Labour's Owen Smith, whose parliamentary career has mirrored that of Crabb, called the arrangement \"highly unusual and unsatisfactory\", adding, \"it's unheard of to have a whip also acting as a minister in a department\".\n\nAt the Wales Office, Crabb worked on maintaining the competitiveness of Wales' energy-intensive industries in the face of high energy costs. In the 2014 Spring Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the British government would compensate energy-intensive industries hit hard by the rising cost of energy.\n\nCrabb was named 'Member to Watch' in the Welsh Yearbook Political Awards 2012. His citation read: \n\nIn the reshuffle of July 2014, Crabb was promoted to Secretary of State for Wales and joined the Cabinet. One of his first acts as Welsh Secretary was to abandon his taxpayer subsidised car in favour of public transport. He has said his proudest moment in the post was brokering a deal between the Treasury and the devolved Welsh government to extend the electrification of the Great Western Main Line to Swansea and The Valleys.\n\nCrabb remained in the job after the post-general election cabinet reshuffle held on 11 May 2015. He welcomed the impact of Iain Duncan Smith's welfare reforms in Wales, saying: \"We can't go soft on welfare reform in a place like Wales – it's precisely the place that needs it.\"\n\nOn 2 March 2016, Crabb voted with the government to reduce by £30 per week the amount of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) paid to disabled people newly placed in the cohort of recipients known as the work-related activity group from April 2017. Crabb's constituency office was vandalised afterwards, with graffiti asking: \"Why do you hate the sick?\" seen on its facade on 12 March.\n\nIn a statement about the outcome of the vote issued on 14 March, Crabb explained: \"What this actually means is that those individuals who are considered to be able to work in the future will now access the same level of benefit as those on Jobseekers Allowance, but will be given better-tailored support to help them into employment. It doesn't affect those already claiming ESA. Of course, we are protecting those that are 'too ill to work'. There is no question about that.\" Three days later, Crabb claimed on his Facebook page that \"only those who are fit to work and actively seeking work are included in the work-related activity group\". His post had to be amended: the work-related activity group contains ESA claimants deemed 'too ill to work' but capable of participating in work-related activities, such as job-coaching and pre-employment training, who are assessed as likely to work within two years, not immediately.\n\nThe following week, Debbie Abrahams MP, Labour's spokesperson on disabilities, said: \"It doesn't bode well for David Cameron that the man he chooses to make the new work and pensions secretary doesn't even know the status of people in the ESA WRAG\", while Jonathan Portes, a former DWP chief economist and an expert on welfare policy, was puzzled that Crabb, as a Cabinet Minister, could vote on important changes to ESA while appearing to be confused about what the vote was about.\n\nOn 19 March 2016, Crabb was appointed to succeed Iain Duncan Smith as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions following the latter's sudden, unexpected resignation over proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), a disability benefit unrelated to the employment status of the claimant. In his first parliamentary statement as Welfare Secretary, Crabb said that the Government \"will not be going ahead with the changes to PIP that were put forward. We have no further plans to make welfare savings beyond the very substantial savings legislated for by parliament two weeks ago [cuts to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)] which we will now focus on implementing.\"\n\nShortly after being appointed, he outlined his views on social security: \"Every party should want to see welfare spending come down. That should be an aspiration for all of us because what you're saying is we are working towards a society where there are fewer people caught in dependency, fewer people who are out of work and need that intervention from the state.\" He also said: \"You have always got to handle issues of welfare with care because you are dealing with support mechanisms for Britain's most vulnerable people\".\n\nIn early April 2016, Crabb gave an interview where he was critical of ESA and its eligibility test. He said: \"ESA was a benefit the previous Labour government brought in when they brought in Work Capability Assessments (WCA) and the truth is it's never worked like it was intended. The WCA was a mess, it didn't recognise mental health issues and it didn't recognise other types of disability\".\n\nIn July 2016, Crabb resigned from the post, after admitting to sending sexually explicit messages to a 19-year-old woman he had interviewed for a job while he was Welsh Minister.\n\nIn June 2016, Crabb announced that he would stand in the Conservative party leadership election, following David Cameron's resignation over the outcome of the 2016 EU membership referendum. He stood on a \"joint ticket\" with the Business Minister, Sajid Javid, with Crabb to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Javid the Chancellor of the Exchequer if Crabb had won.\n\nCrabb promised to create a £100 billion \"Growing Britain Fund\", which he would use for flood defences, fibre-optic broadband, and Crossrail 2. He hoped to finance this through new government bonds, because \"the cost of borrowing is incredibly low. Spending government money on infrastructure has therefore never been more affordable\". He also said he would: allow the third runway at Heathrow to go ahead; create an advisory council with members from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London to help with negotiations with the EU; and not hold a snap election nor a second EU referendum.\n\nOn 5 July 2016, after the first ballot of Conservative MPs, he was in penultimate place. The tailender, Liam Fox, was eliminated from the contest; Crabb then withdrew from the race, giving his backing to Theresa May.\n\nIn the general election of 8 June 2017, Crabb again retained his seat, though with a majority of only 314; however, his share of the vote increased to 43.4%. He claimed that he had lost votes in the election through Conservative spending cuts. He also said local authority employees, nurses and teachers should get a pay rise.\n\nIn the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Crabb's majority increased to 5,042.\n\nCrabb is a Christian who believes in the practical value of prayer and who feels the church should play an active role in community life.\n\nHe has past links to Christian Action Research and Education (CARE), an advocacy group that is opposed to LGBT rights – during the 1990s Crabb was a parliamentary intern backed by the organisation, and he is one of around twenty MPs to have employed interns funded by CARE. When quizzed about his views during his party leadership bid in July 2016, Crabb said: \"I don't believe that being gay is a sin. I don't believe it's something to be cured. I've never said anything like that,\" and claimed accusations to the contrary were \"a complete falsehood spread by political opponents\". CARE has jointly sponsored a conference at which a discussion of \"therapeutic approaches to same sex attraction\" was discussed by one of the panel.\n\nOn 5 February 2013, in the House of Commons vote Crabb voted against same-sex marriage.\n\nCrabb is Parliamentary Chairman of Conservative Friends of Israel, a pressure or lobby group which stated in 2014 that it included among its membership 80% of Conservative Party MPs. In May 2016, he spoke at a meeting organised by an Orthodox Jewish youth movement to mark the establishment of Israel in 1948. He celebrated the claim that Israel is a country in the Middle East where Christians are not persecuted and said of his visit to Israel in 2007: \"As a Christian, I have always felt a very close affinity with the Holy Land. It was a delight to see places that I had learned about during my own childhood at Sunday school and in the pages of the scriptures we were encouraged to read.\" He went on to draw a parallel between the size and verdancy of Israel and that of his own \"homeland\", Wales.\n\nIn October 2017, newspapers reported that in 2013 a well-known male MP had been sending sexually explicit messages to a 19-year-old female candidate he had interviewed for a role in his office. On 28 October 2017, \"The Telegraph\" reported that Crabb was the MP responsible for sending the text messages.\n\nEarlier allegations about sending suggestive text messages had resulted in his resignation as Work and Pensions Secretary in 2016. Crabb apologised for the text messages, and on 23 December 2017 a Conservative Party investigating panel determined that his behaviour had been inappropriate, but did not constitute harassment.\n\nA friend of the woman said they saw messages in which the father-of-two \"said he wanted to have sex with her\". Crabb admitted sending the messages and saying \"some pretty outrageous things\" to the woman after interviewing her for a job, adding that the messages \"basically amount to unfaithfulness\".\n\nCrabb is married to Béatrice Monnier, who is French; they have two children. They met whilst studying at the University of Bristol. He is in the squad of the Commons and Lords rugby union team.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873589", "title": "Modekngei", "text": "Modekngei\n\nModekngei, or \"Ngara Modekngei\" (United Sect), is a monotheistic religious movement founded around 1915 by Temedad, a native of the island of Babeldaob, that spread throughout Palau. It rose to political significance between the First and Second World Wars and is currently professed by 8.8% of Palau's population.\nModekngei is a hybrid of ancient Palauan customs and Christianity. Followers of the religion believe in the Christian God and recognize Jesus Christ as their savior and simultaneously make appeasements to the traditional Palauan deities.\n\nWhile only about 8% of Palauans may practice Modekngei, a large concentration of these adherents actually reside in the village of Ibobang, a small town with a population of less than 100 in Ngatpang state.\n\nThe origins of Modekngei are unknown, but one theory is that Modekngei began as a form of cultural resistance to the Japanese occupation of Palau. By amalgamating native animistic and Christian beliefs in an oral tradition of chants called \"keskes,\" the islanders may have been better able to preserve and transmit their traditions.\n\nA common story in Ngatpang is that the religion developed from the efforts of Christian missionaries in Palau who hoped to convert the islanders. After visiting the village of Ibobang, the missionaries were so impressed by the villagers' commitment their customs that they allowed the Palauans to keep their goddess while still practicing Christianity.\n\nThe goal of Modekngei is to preserve ancient Palauan traditions in a way that aligns with Christianity.\n\nAdherents in Ibobang practice a traditional lifestyle centered on ancient ideas of family, community, and purity. The religion prohibits followers from all alcohol and drug use, and children in the village are required to be home by dark and abstain from making loud noises in sacred places.\n\nCitizens of Ibobang attend daily church services. The church building is located in the center of the village and is likewise the center of activity. One Modekngei custom requires members of the community to walk silently to church each morning. To speak, especially loudly, before a church service is disrespectful and borderline blasphemous.\n\nWomen in Ibobang usually dress in western apparel, but at church they are required to always wear a skirt or dress when either entering or passing the building. As a result, it’s not uncommon to see a woman in Ibobang dressed in pants to take a longer route to her destination to keep from crossing the church grounds without the proper attire.\nDaily Modekngei church services are short, consisting mostly of individual and group prayers. However, services celebrating both traditional and religious holidays are more elaborate and can last several days, with weeks of communal preparation.\n\nOne custom that most Palauans observe—regardless of religious affiliation—is the prohibition of alcohol or tobacco within the Ibobang city limits. According to tradition, violating this religious ban will bring terrible rainstorms upon the village that won’t go away until the sin has been forgiven by the Modekngei goddess.\n\nEven Palauans who may normally drink or smoke will abstain from bringing the banned substances within the city limits. The belief that rains will plague the village is so strong that Modekngei elders will hang fruit and other treats on tree branches throughout the village in hopes of bribing the goddess to be forgiving of outsiders' misconduct.\n\nAnother customary activity that takes place in Ibobang is the blessing of the roads. This particular custom coincides with the moon’s cycle. A few days before each full moon, the community works together to clean the entire village. Lawns are cut, trash is cleaned and houses are scrubbed. Then, the evening before the full moon dawns, everyone who lives in Ibobang waits inside their houses while a village elder walks up and down the streets chanting prayers and blessings over the village. This is a necessary practice in Modekngei because it’s believed that during a full moon, the Modekngei goddess is better able to see the malpractices of her people.\n\nIbobang is the home of Belau Modekngei School (BMS), a boarding school for high school students situated at the far end of the village. In 1974, a handful of Modekngei elders realized their desire to pass on the ancient traditions of the Modekngei religion to future generations.\n\nToday, between 25 and 30 students from the 9th to 12th grade are enrolled at BMS. Students and faculty have the option of living on campus in traditional dormatory-style housing with no electricity or running water, or in the surrounding villages of Ngatpang. Slightly more than half the students live on campus.\n\nThe student body at BMS is diverse. Some of the students attend because they come from families who value a traditional education. Other students enroll at BMS as a last resort. As one of very few private high schools on Palau, BMS has the option of accepting students who have been expelled from the island's only public high school.\n\nStudents at BMS study core academic subjects such as English, Math and Palauan, but they also take Modekngei religious classes, have the opportunity to farm ancient medicinal crops, and practice traditional customs with the wider village.\n\nBelau Modekngei's primary goal is to preserve Modekngei religion for future generations of Palauans.\n\n"}
{"id": "1873590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873590", "title": "Education Quality and Accountability Office", "text": "Education Quality and Accountability Office\n\nThe Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) is an arm’s-length Crown agency of the Government of Ontario in Canada. It was legislated into creation in 1996 in response to recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Learning in February 1995.\n\nEQAO is governed by a board of directors appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Cameron Montgomery has been the chair of the board since February 2019. EQAO has an annual budget of approximately $33 million CDN.\n\nThe stated purpose of EQAO tests is to ensure that there is accountability between school boards and schools in the publicly funded system in Ontario. Educational accountability is important to three key stakeholders: taxpayers, elected officials, and teachers. By providing yearly standardized tests, the Ministry of Education hopes to increase the quality of education in Ontario, while also using the tests to make plans for future improvement.\n\nEQAO tests are intended to measure the students' ability to:\n\nIt is important to note that EQAO tests have different goals and intentions than normal classroom tests. These tests are not the same, but when considering the EQAO test results along with the classroom results, they can provide a picture of the students' overall learning.\n\nClassroom tests:\n\nEQAO tests:\n\nEQAO’s mandate is to conduct province-wide tests at key points in every student’s primary, junior and secondary education and report the results to educators, parents and the public.\n\nThe specific responsibilities of the Office include:\n\nEQAO conducts province-wide tests annually. Students attending publicly-funded elementary and secondary schools in Ontario are required to take the respective tests at their grade level:\n\nFor students with special education needs, some accommodations that are consistent with regular classroom assessment practices are permitted on the provincial tests. Special provisions may also be permitted for English language learners. In extenuating circumstances, the principal may exempt a student from writing the test if they are unable to complete part or all of the test, even with the appropriate accommodations.\n\nThe question on EQAO’s tests are developed by Ontario educators and linked directly to the learning expectations in The Ontario Curriculum.\n\nEducators use the results of Ontario’s province-wide tests in combination with other important information, such as demographic information, to help improve student learning and achievement. According to a 2010 survey by EQAO, more than 95% of elementary school principals and 80% of Grades 3 and 6 teachers use EQAO test results to identify areas of strength and areas for improvement in reading, writing and math programs. More than 95% of principals also reported that they use the data to guide overall school improvement initiatives.\n\nOntario student achievement results have had mixed success and failure since the EQAO began. For example, in the last five years, Grade 6 student reading scores have increased from 79% to 82% of students meeting the provincial standard (up from an all time low in 1999 of only 48%). Similar improvements have been seen for writing with the percentage of students meeting the provincial standard increasing from 78% to 80% in the last 5 years (up from an all time low in 1999 of only 48%). However, over the last five years Math scores have degraded from 54% of students achieving the provincial standard in 2013 to only 49% in 2018. Previous EQAO math testing had a high score of 63% in 2009. The dramatic 14% decrease in math scores in only ten years has resulted in the province launching an entire new math curriculum for the 2019-2020 school year.\n\nEQAO tests are based on The Ontario Curriculum, which is the foundation for what is taught in classrooms every day. Therefore, students should not need to study or do extra preparation for the test. All of the information in the test will have been covered by the classroom teacher throughout the entire school year. The best way for parents to support their children in writing the test is simply to be supportive and a play an active role in their children's learning every day of the school year. This support includes being aware of what the students are learning, being in constant communication with the classroom teacher about the student's learning development and needs, and providing a welcoming environment at home where students are able to complete any homework or assignments they may have.\n\nAn additional way that parents can help students in preparing for the test is to visit the EQAO website (eqao.com) in order to find links explaining the format and sample test items, a result guide that explains how to interpret the marks, as well as a parent bulletin regarding the test. The school boards also provide parents with information sessions regarding the tests, to ensure that the parents are fully aware of the purpose, format and implementation of the test.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges surrounding EQAO testing is the idea that the traditional paper-and-pencil test does not assess all aspects of student learning. While the test is able to assess students' reading and writing, it struggles to effectively assess performance-based skills such as being able to work effectively in a group, designing a project or model, and speaking clearly.\n\nAnother challenge associated with EQAO testing is that students' ability to do their best on the test may be affected by feelings of stress and test anxiety. Some students may feel pressured to do well, because of external pressures from the teacher and parents, or pressure from themselves to succeed, and therefore may struggle to complete the test in a way that truly demonstrates their knowledge and learning.\n\nThe establishment of the EQAO, and in particular standardized testing in Ontario, has been criticized by a number of groups, including the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) and the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO). . Since the beginning, EQAO has received extensive criticism, especially about areas such as validity of the test, timelines for the tests, uses of the data results, and security. The ETFO published a video on August 17, 2010, titled \"Is EQAO Failing Our Children?\". This video provides an outlook on EQAO from the teachers perspective, discussing how the test may be causing more damage to children than good. This video can be seen on YouTube here.\n\nWhile technical reports are available on the agency’s Web site, some have complained that the Office publishes little technical information about its tests. An evaluation conducted for EQAO, published by it in 2013, and posted on the website mentions no aspects of reliability or validity other than inter-rater agreement, and inter-rater agreement is presented as evidence of validity rather than of reliability.\n\nSome have also pointed out that EQAO’s staff tends to be drawn from the provincial education establishment. For example, former chair Charles Pascal, is a former deputy minister of education. The Office's impartiality has been questioned when it has issued test results that might be taken as reflecting well on the provincial government.\n\nAnother major area of criticism is focused on the monetary expenses used each year to conduct the EQAO tests. The annual report states that $33 million was used in 2009/2010, plus an additional $77 million spent by the Literacy and Numeracy Secretariat, in hopes to improve future test scores. Some critics believe that the money poured into these annual tests could be better spent on things such as smaller class sizes, new schools, new classrooms, additional technology in classrooms, additional educational assistants, and additional classroom materials.\n\nSome critics believe that the teacher knows best about the students' learning, and that a standardized-test does not adequately assess the authentic learning that has gone on in the classroom throughout the year. Teachers are able to see the students everyday, track their learning progress, and provide the students with beneficial feedback to continue improving their work. EQAO tests on the other hand, approach learning from a structured and systematic perspective, forcing students to demonstrate their knowledge in a way very different from that which is typically done in the classroom. The test does not allow for the student to grow or learn from the process, due to the fact that feedback is prohibited throughout the time writing the test. The majority use of multiple-choice questions limits critical thinking, and restricts creativity in the students. In addition, the test provides only one form of assessment. Authentic assessment is that which provides students with multiple ways to demonstrate their learning (example, through writing, speaking, demonstration, and hands-on interactions). Other subjects such as science, business, visual arts, music and physical education are not being assessed in the test despite being part of the education system.\n\nAnother recognized flaw in the EQAO testing system is with regards to Ontario’s French Immersion program, which is consistently growing in attendance and popularity. Studies have shown that students enrolled in early French Immersion programs demonstrate a lag in their English literacy skills in the grade 3 EQAO test. These lower scores cause undue stress and concern for parents, students and teachers of these students. It has been recommended that EQAO offers the opportunity for early immersion students to opt out of the grade 3 testing as the results do not accurately represent the students’ abilities. \n\n\n"}

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Rochford and Southend East since May 2005. He served as a government whip between May 2010 and September 2012 and as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office between October 2015 and July 2016. He served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union from July 2019 until 31 January 2020 when the United Kingdom left the European Union and his office was abolished. In February 2020 he was appointed as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development.\n\nDuddridge was born on 26 August 1971 in Bristol. He was educated at Crestwood School, Huddersfield High School and The Blue School, Wells. He read Government at the University of Essex.\n\nDuddridge served as Chairman of the Wells Young Conservatives from 1989 until 1991, and was elected Chairman of Essex University's Conservative Association in 1990. In 1991, whilst at university, local Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin appointed him as a researcher.\n\nAfter graduating in 1993, Duddridge went on to pursue a career in the private sector. He was a banker with Barclays in the City of London and Africa for 10 years, rising to National Sales Director in the Ivory Coast and eventually running the bank's operations in Botswana with a staff of 750 people. He was also a founder member of the polling firm YouGov.\n\nDuddridge unsuccessfully contested Rother Valley at the 2001 general election for the Conservative Party, finishing second some 14,882 votes behind the sitting Labour MP, Kevin Barron but achieving a 5% swing in his favour. He was subsequently selected as the Conservatives' parliamentary candidate for Rochford and Southend East at the 2005 general election, following Sir Teddy Taylor's retirement. He held the seat for the Conservatives with a majority of 5,494 and delivered his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 9 June 2005.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Duddridge has served on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, and the International Development Committee from 2006 to 2008, and in January 2008, he was appointed an Opposition Whip. He was returned at the 2010 general election again as Rochford and Southend East's MP, becoming a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury (Government Whip) with responsibility for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Education, but later left government in Prime Minister David Cameron's September 2012 reshuffle.\n\nOn 3 December 2010, Duddridge was permitted to reply on HM Government's behalf from the Despatch Box during an Adjournment debate, a rarity as Commons Whips – particularly Government Whips – by convention do not speak in the Chamber.\n\nDuddridge voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill at both its second reading in February 2013 and its third reading in May 2013.\n\nOn 11 August 2014, it was announced that Duddridge would return to Government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs following the resignation of Mark Simmonds over his claims that he 'could not support his family in London on an MP's salary'.\n\nIn September 2014, he claimed £11,348 for accommodation in London on expenses, mostly for hotels, despite already owning two homes in the city. He stated that his claims were in accordance with the Independent Parliamentary Standards authority. The previous year, it was reported that he had the highest expenses claim of local MPs in Essex. He was accused by Sir Ian Kennedy of pursuing a \"squalid vendetta\" after he helped block the former head of the Commons expenses watchdog from an appointment to a new job of electoral commissioner in January 2018.\n\nDuddridge is seen as highly Eurosceptic having suggested in 2013 that the Government should tell the European Commissioner to \"sod off\" rather than pay benefits to Romanians and Bulgarians.\n\nIn January 2016, the Labour Party unsuccessfully proposed an amendment in Parliament that would have required private landlords to make their homes \"fit for human habitation\". According to Parliament's register of interests, Duddridge was one of 72 Conservative MPs who voted against the amendment who personally derived an income from renting out property. The Conservative Government had responded to the amendment that they believed homes should be fit for human habitation but did not want to pass the new law that would explicitly require it.\n\nOn 9 February 2017, Duddridge tabled an Early Day Motion following comments made by Commons speaker John Bercow on the subject of the pending state visit of US President Donald Trump. The motion proposed \"that this House has no confidence in Mr Speaker\", and received criticism from across the house. The bid to remove Bercow as Commons Speaker failed after just five MPs backed Duddridge's motion of no confidence.\n\nIn the House of Commons he sits on the High Speed Rail (West Midlands - Crewe) Bill Select Committee (Commons) and has sat on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, the International Development Committee, the Regulatory Reform Committee, the Procedure Committee and the International Development Sub-Committee on the Work of the Independent Commission for Aid Impact.\n\nOn 27 September 2017, \"The Times\" reported that Duddridge, who was Africa minister until 2016, was being paid £3,300 for eight hours' work a month as a consultant for Brand Communications on top of his MP's salary. The newspaper reported that this had led to renewed calls to review the rules surrounding jobs for former members of government. It was reported that he was working for Brand Communications and that the company was one of a handful that had not agreed to the industry's code of conduct that bans hiring sitting MPs. Duddridge told \"The Times\": \"The work I do involves helping companies going into the African marketplace re-brand themselves. It is not a public affairs role.\"\n\nOn 27 Jul 2019 he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union in Boris Johnson's administration.\n\n"}

Gordy is best known for his appearances in the United States with promotions such as World Class Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling and the Universal Wrestling Federation as a member of The Fabulous Freebirds, as well as his appearances in Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling as one-half of The Miracle Violence Connection.\n\nChampionships held by Gordy over the course of his career include the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, AJPW World Tag Team Championship, WCW World Tag Team Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, UWF Heavyweight Championship and SMW Heavyweight Championship.\n\nHe has been posthumously inducted into the Wrestling Observer, Professional Wrestling, and WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nGordy started wrestling in 1975 at the age of 14 as Terry Mecca for the International Wrestling Association. In early 1979, he began wrestling under his real name and formed The Fabulous Freebirds with Michael Hayes. Buddy Roberts was later added to the group.\n\nThe Freebirds came to Memphis the first time in 1979 and feuded mainly with Jerry Lawler & Bill Dundee. When in mid South Wrestling, he formed The Fabulous Freebirds as the suggestion by Bill Watts with Michael Hayes and Buddy Roberts. They returned in 1984 to feud with Lawler & Austin Idol and later with Lawler & Phil Hickerson.\n\nIn 1986, when the Freebirds were in the Universal Wrestling Federation, the former Mid South Wrestling, Gordy won the UWF Heavyweight Championship \ntitle and held it for six months, before losing it via forfeit to The One Man Gang, after an angle the same night in which Gordy was injured by \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams. During this time, Gordy and the Freebirds had an ongoing feud with the UWF fan favorite Hacksaw Jim Duggan, in which Duggan and Gordy frequently squared off, usually ending in a disqualification because of outside interference.\n\nIn 1982, the Freebirds went to World Class Championship Wrestling and had a heated and memorable feud with the Von Erichs (David, Kevin, Kerry and Mike) that was famously kicked off when Gordy slammed the Cage door on Kerry during his Cage Match at WCCW Star Wars (1982) against Ric Flair where Michael Hayes was the special guest Referee inciting a riot among fans attending. They traded the six man title back and forth a few times over the years. Gordy was also at one time one half of the WCCW American Tag Team champions. While in WCCW, Killer Khan taught Gordy how to perform the Oriental Spike.\n\nGordy teamed with Stan Hansen beginning in 1987 in All Japan Pro Wrestling. Gordy later teamed with Steve Williams as The Miracle Violence Connection. During his time there, he also held the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship on two occasions.\n\nThe Freebirds spent a very brief time in the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, but were fired after missing a show and showing up, many times, late and drunk.\n\nThe Freebirds spent some time in the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions where they split to feud briefly, but later reunited.\n\nIn 1989, Gordy helped Hayes to reform the Freebirds, with Jimmy Garvin, in Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), which became World Championship Wrestling in 1991. Later he alongside of Dr. Death Steve Williams defeated the Steiners to become World Tag Team Champions.\n\nGordy and Williams returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1992 and won the WCW World Tag Team titles. They also won the NWA World Tag Team titles in a tournament at the Great American Bash card in Albany, Georgia, one week later, and unified the titles. Their feud with Rick and Scott Steiner; in Japan, this was hyped as a feud between the best foreign teams of the two top Japanese promotions (the Steiners were competing for rival New Japan Pro Wrestling at the time). Despite advances by New Japan, Gordy and Williams, out of loyalty to the AJPW founder and promoter, Giant Baba, refused to compete for the promotion (which had business ties with WCW at the time), leading to Gordy's departure from WCW before Halloween Havoc and Williams' departure after Starrcade.\n\nIn 1993 Gordy, while traveling from the United States to Japan for a tour, took an overdose of pain medication and slipped into a coma, ultimately suffering permanent brain damage. He returned to action later that year, but never received a shot at the Triple Crown again. In 1994, Gordy had a small reunion with Hayes and Garvin as the Freebirds in the Global Wrestling Federation where he and Garvin won the GWF Tag Team titles.\n\nIn 1996, Gordy showed up in Extreme Championship Wrestling to challenge Raven for the ECW World Heavyweight title, as the \"internationally recognized #1 contender\". He had been working for the International Wrestling Association of Japan promotion in Japan, wrestling deathmatches. He lost, but went on to team up with Tommy Dreamer and later to reunite with \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams to wrestle The Eliminators. He also wrestled Bam Bam Bigelow in what was the second ever \"Battle Of The Bam Bams\" (The first happened on a Windy City Wrestling show). Gordy lost the match due to outside interference from The Eliminators.\n\nGordy had a brief run in the WWF as The Executioner in 1996 and 1997. He teamed up with Mankind, both managed by Paul Bearer, and feuded with The Undertaker. The Executioner came to the ring under a mask and carrying an axe. He made his TV debut at the In Your House pay-per-view, \"\", where he interfered in The Undertaker's Buried Alive match with Mankind, hitting Undertaker with a shovel and burying him with the help of Mankind and several other wrestlers. However, at \"\", The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an Armageddon Rules match, and Gordy left the promotion shortly afterwards. His final televised appearance was on the January 12, 1997 episode of \"WWF Superstars\", where he lost to Goldust, after which Paul Bearer turned on him by hitting him with his urn. He was advertised to be one of the 30 participants in the 1997 Royal Rumble match, but did not make an appearance.\n\nOn an episode of \"Something to Wrestle With\", Bruce Prichard claimed that the Executioner gimmick was given to Gordy because McMahon had doubts that Gordy could still compete effectively and the use of a mask was intended to protect Gordy so that if that were the case, Gordy's legacy would not be tainted. Had Gordy been able to compete at a high level then there would have been the opportunity later for Gordy to unmask. It was mentioned that the hiring was mostly done as a favor for Michael Hayes.\n\nGordy left behind 2 young daughters, Amber and Miranda Gordy, and a son, Ray Gordy. Ray Gordy wrestled for WWE as \"Jesse\" and \"Slam Master J\" before being released in 2010. His nephew is Richard Aslinger, who competed for All Japan Pro Wrestling as Richard Slinger. His daughter Miranda currently wrestles on the independent circuit and has also competed in Japan\n\nGordy died of a heart attack caused by a blood clot on July 16, 2001. He was 40.\n\nIn 2014, he was posthumously inducted into the Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame. A year later, he was also posthumously inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, Gordy was posthumously inducted by his son into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of The Fabulous Freebirds.\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the Cabinet under Theresa May, most notably as Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor from 2018 to 2019. First elected as a Conservative, Gauke had the Conservative whip removed on 3 September 2019 and until the dissolution sat as an independent politician.\n\nGauke served in the Cameron Government as Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury from 2010 to 2014 and Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 2014 to 2016. During the formation of the May Government in July 2016, he was appointed to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, where he remained until being appointed Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in 2017. Gauke was appointed Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor in January 2018. He resigned on 24 July 2019 following the Conservative Party leadership election.\n\nGauke was educated at Northgate High School in Ipswich, Suffolk. He read Law at St Edmund Hall, Oxford and the College of Law in Chester, where he graduated in legal practice in 1995.\n\nIn 1993, he was a researcher for Barry Legg, the Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South West. He worked as a trainee solicitor with Richards Butler from 1995, being admitted as a solicitor in 1997. From 1999 to 2005, he was a solicitor in the financial services group at Macfarlanes, a corporate law firm.\n\nGauke was elected as the vice-chairman of the Brent East Conservative Association for two years from 1998, and contested the seat at the 2001 general election finishing in second place 13,047 votes behind the Labour MP Paul Daisley.\n\nGauke was elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for Hertfordshire South West following the retirement of Richard Page. Gauke won the seat with a majority of 8,473, making his maiden speech on 9 June 2005. Between 2005 and 2008, he served as a member of the Procedure Select committee. He was a member of the Treasury Select Committee between 2006 and 2007, before joining the Opposition front bench as Shadow Treasury Minister.\n\nFollowing his re-election at the 2010 general election, he was appointed Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury.\n\nIn December 2013, Gauke was reported to HM Revenue and Customs after advertising an unpaid six-month \"training post\" at his constituency office in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire.\n\nAfter four years in the post of Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Gauke moved to become the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.\n\nOn 13 July 2016, Gauke was made a member of the Privy Council, giving him the style The Right Honourable. The following day, he was appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury following the appointment of Theresa May to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. \n\nOn 11 June 2017, Gauke was appointed Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, leaving the Treasury after seven years. \n\nOn 8 January 2018, Gauke succeeded David Lidington as Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor. He is the first solicitor to have held the post.\n\nOn 8 June 2019, following Gauke's \"refusal to enact the commitments made in the Conservative manifesto\" and his supporting the leadership candidacy of Rory Stewart in favour of persisting with May's withdrawal agreement, his constituency association wrote to all members calling a special meeting for a vote of no-confidence.\n\nOn 20 July 2019, Gauke confirmed to \"The Sunday Times\" that he would resign as Secretary of State after Prime Minister's Questions on 24 July 2019, citing that he could not serve Boris Johnson as Prime Minister and run the risk of pursuing a no-deal exit from the European Union. Gauke and other similarly minded MPs became known in the media as the \"Gaukeward Squad\".\n\nGauke claimed £10,248.32 in stamp duty and fees involved in the purchase of his second home in London, a flat. A Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" programme revealed that he was claiming expenses on the flat in central London despite having a property located only one hour away on public transport.\n\nGauke sold the flat in August 2012, keeping £27,000, the property price having increased by £67,000 since purchase. He paid nearly £40,000 of this to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) as MPs only have to pay back any profit made in the previous two years.\n\nHe told the British public that negotiating a price discount with tradesmen for paying in cash for the purposes of evading tax is morally wrong.\n\nOn 3 September 2019, Gauke joined 20 other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson. The rebel MPs voted with the Opposition to seize control of parliamentary business from the government, allowing the subsequent passage of the Benn act. The government had declared that voting against the original motion would be viewed as a matter of confidence in the government, as voting in favour of the motion would effectively be \"destroying the government's negotiating position and handing control of parliament to Jeremy Corbyn.\" After voting against the government on a \"confidence-issue,\" all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative whip, expelling them as Conservative MPs and requiring them to sit as independents. If they decided to run for re-election in a future election, the party would block their selection as Conservative candidates.\n\nGauke stood in his constituency as an independent candidate, but came second with 26% of the vote. The seat was retained by the Conservatives with a majority of 14,408.\n\nIn May 2020, six months after leaving parliament, it was announced that Gauke was re-joining Macfarlanes as their head of policy.\n\nGauke is married to Rachel (née Rank), who is a professional support lawyer specialising in corporate tax at legal research provider LexisNexis. They have three sons and live in Chorleywood in Hertfordshire.\n\nHe is a lifelong supporter of Ipswich Town F.C.\n\n"}

It is the country's main cup competition, being open to all clubs affiliated with the Romanian Football Federation (FRF) and the county football associations regardless of the league they belong to. Currently, the winner of the competition is granted a place in the UEFA Europa League qualifiers and plays the Supercupa României.\n\nMost finals have been held at the Stadionul Național (formerly known as \"23 August\"), and occasionally at other stadiums in Bucharest. During the construction of the new Stadionul Național, the final was staged each year in a different major city of the country. In 2007, the final was held in Timișoara at the Dan Păltinișanu stadium, this being the second occasion when the last game was played outside Bucharest (the first occurrence took place in 1989, when Brașov hosted the event). Then, the next three finals were staged in Piatra Neamț, Târgu Jiu, Iași and again in Brașov.\n\nThe competition has been dominated by Bucharest-based teams, the most successful performers being FCSB with twenty-three trophies, followed by Rapid București and Dinamo București with thirteen each. The record for the most consecutive Cups won is held by Rapid București, who won the Romanian Cup 6 times in a row, between 1937 and 1942.\n\nOn 22 July 2005, FRF and Samsung Electronics signed a one-year sponsorship deal. The name of the competition was changed to \"Cupa României Samsung\".\n\nOn 9 October 2006, FRF and Ursus Breweries (part of the SABMiller group) signed a sponsorship agreement for the next three seasons. Ursus Breweries changed the name of the competition to \"Cupa României Timișoreana\", after the Timișoreana beer brand.\n\nOn 16 May 2016, FRF announced the rebranding of competition and the signing of contracts with new sponsors like Kaufland, UPC Broadband and Stanleybet.\n\nOn 20 October 2017, FRF announced that the new main sponsor of the competition is the betting company Casa Pariurilor.\n\nThe competition has undergone minor changes in format over the years. The following format came in use in the 2009–10 season. The main differences between the current system and the last one are the dates at which rounds take place, and the two-legged format of the semifinals.\n\nThe competition at this phase is organized by the county football associations. Forty-two teams (one from each county) advance to the next phase.\n\nThe competition at this phase is organized by the Romanian Football Federation (FRF). For the first five rounds, teams are paired using geographical criteria in order to avoid long travel distances. The teams from a lower division or with a lower ranking in the last league season host the games.\n\n\n\nEvery year, based on the national and international football calendar, FRF's executive committee may choose a two-leg or one-leg system for the round of 16, quarterfinals and semifinals. Games at these stages are, when played using a one-leg system, hosted by a neutral venue. The final is held at a pre-established venue, normally in Bucharest.\n\nThe performance of various clubs is shown in the following table:\nThe following table sorts cities by the number of Cups won by local teams.

{"id": "1873613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873613", "title": "Jeremy Hunt", "text": "Jeremy Hunt\n\nJeremy Richard Streynsham Hunt (born 1 November 1966) is a British politician serving as Member of Parliament (MP) for South West Surrey since 2005. A member of the Conservative Party, he served in the Cabinet from 2010 to 2019, including as Foreign Secretary from 2018 to 2019. He identifies as a one-nation conservative, and has been associated with economically liberal and socially liberal policies. Hunt was a candidate for Leader of the Conservative Party, and Prime Minister, in the 2019 leadership contest, losing to Boris Johnson.\n\nThe son of a senior officer in the Royal Navy, Hunt was born in Kennington and studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was President of the Oxford University Conservative Association. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 2005, and was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for Disabled People and later as Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Hunt served in the Cameron Government as Culture Secretary and Minister for the Olympics from 2010 to 2012, where he led the drive for local TV, resulting in Ofcom awarding local TV broadcasting licences in respect of several cities and towns. Hunt also oversaw the 2012 London Olympics, which received widespread acclaim.\n\nHe served as Secretary of State for Health, later Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, from 2012 until 2018. He oversaw the imposition of a controversial new junior doctors' contract in England after the failure of negotiations. During the dispute, junior doctors undertook multiple strikes, the first such industrial action for 40 years. Hunt was re-appointed Health Secretary in the May Government; with an additional portfolio of social care in England in January 2018. On 3 June 2018, Hunt became the longest-serving Health Secretary in British political history. The following month, he was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, following the resignation of Boris Johnson over the Chequers Agreement. He resigned following Johnson's election as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister on 24 July 2019.\n\nJeremy Hunt was born in Lambeth Hospital, Kennington, the eldest son of Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt, who was then a Commander in the Royal Navy assigned to work for the Director of Naval Plans inside the recently created Ministry of Defence, and his wife Meriel Eve \"née\" Givan (now Lady Hunt), daughter of Major Henry Cooke Givan. The Hunt family were landed gentry, of Boreatton, Baschurch, Shropshire. A cousin was Agnes Hunt, pioneer of orthopaedic nursing. Through a paternal great-grandmother, Hunt is a descendant of Sir Streynsham Master, a pioneer of the East India Company.\n\nHunt was raised in Shere, Surrey, near the constituency that he represents in Parliament. He is a distant relation of Elizabeth II and Sir Oswald Mosley.\n\nHunt was educated at Charterhouse where he was Head of School. He then read Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Magdalen College, Oxford, and took a first class honours Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. He became involved in Conservative politics while at university, where David Cameron and Boris Johnson were contemporaries. He was active in the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), and was elected to serve as President in 1987. In addition to these activities, Hunt was a member of the infamous Bullingdon Club.\n\nAfter university Hunt worked for two years as a management consultant at OC&C Strategy Consultants, and then became an English language teacher in Japan. In April 2019, he has delivered a whistle-stop explanation of Brexit in Japanese to Japanese students during a visit to Hibiya High School in Tokyo.\n\nOn his return to Britain he tried his hand at a number of different entrepreneurial business ventures, with three failed start-ups including an attempt to export marmalade to Japan. In 1991, Hunt co-founded a public relations agency named Profile PR specialising in IT with Mike Elms, a childhood friend. Hunt and Elms later sold their interest in Profile PR to concentrate on directory publishing.\n\nHunt had been interested in creating a 'guide to help people who want to study rather than just travel abroad' and, together with Elms, founded a company known as Hotcourses in the 1990s, a major client of which is the British Council. Hunt stood down as director of the company in 2009; however, he still retained 48% of the shares in the company, which were held in a blind trust before Hotcourses was sold in January 2017 for over £30 million to Australian education organisation IDP Education. He personally gained over £14 million from the sale and in doing so became the richest Cabinet member.\n\nHunt was elected at the 2005 general election, after the previous Conservative MP Virginia Bottomley was created a life peeress. He was elected to represent the constituency of South West Surrey with a majority of 5,711.\n\nAfter supporting David Cameron's bid for leadership of the Conservative Party, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Disabled People in December 2005. In the same year, he was a co-author of a policy pamphlet \"Direct Democracy: An Agenda For A New Model Party\" which included statements supporting denationalising the NHS and suggested replacing it with \"universal insurance\". Hunt later denied that the policy pamphlet expresses his views. In David Cameron's reshuffle of 2 July 2007, Hunt joined the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. When the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats formed a coalition following the 2010 general election, Hunt was appointed Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport (combining the roles of leading the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with that of Minister for the Olympics). He was consequently appointed a Privy Councillor on 13 May 2010. He has been characterised as a \"metropolitan liberal\" by the \"Financial Times\" and he campaigned to remain in the 2016 EU referendum.\n\nIn 2009, Hunt was investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The commissioner found: \"Mr Hunt was in breach of the rules in not reducing his claims on the Additional Costs Allowance in that period to take full account of his agent's living costs. As a result, public funds provided a benefit to the constituency agent ... Mr Hunt received no real financial benefit from the arrangement and that the error was caused by his misinterpretation of the rules.\"\n\nHunt's offer to repay half the money (£9,558.50) was accepted. Hunt repaid £1,996 for claiming the expenses of his Farnham home while claiming the mortgage of his Hammersmith home. The commissioner said: \"Mr Hunt has readily accepted that he was in error, and in breach of the rules of the House, in making a claim for utilities and other services on his Farnham home in the period during which it was still his main home. He has repaid the sum claimed, £1,996, in full. It is clear that, as a new Member in May 2005, his office arrangements were at best disorganised.\" The \"Legg Report\" showed no other issues.\n\nHunt supported Britain remaining in the European Union (EU) in the 2016 referendum. After the result which supported Brexit was announced, Hunt suggested a second referendum on the terms of any exit deal with him personally backing one in which the UK would stay in the Single Market. In 2017 he stated that he had changed his mind, and now supported Brexit, citing the \"arrogance of the EU Commission\" in responding to the UK government in the Brexit negotiations.\n\nIn July 2018, Hunt expressed fears over the UK potentially leaving the EU without a deal. He said that it would be \"incredibly challenging economically\" and that \"It would lead to a fissure in relations which would be highly damaging for that great partnership that we have had for so many years, which has been so important in sustaining the international order.\" In a December 2018 interview with the \"Daily Telegraph\", he suggested the UK would \"flourish and prosper\" even without a deal, although he continued to back the Brexit withdrawal agreement proposed by Theresa May. In March 2019 he stated that a \"lot more work\" was needed to get MPs to back May's deal but there were \"encouraging signs\" that progress was being made.\n\nIn April 2018, \"The Daily Telegraph\" revealed that Hunt breached anti-money laundering legislation by failing to declare his 50 per cent interest in a property firm to Companies House within the required 28 days. Hunt also failed to disclose his interest in the property firm on the Parliamentary Register of Members’ interests within the required 28 days. Hunt later rectified the error. A spokesman for Hunt said that Hunt's \"accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.\" In response, a spokesman for Downing Street agreed with the Cabinet Office that there was no breach of the ministerial code. The Labour Party referred Hunt to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. \"The Guardian\" revealed that Hunt was able to buy seven luxury flats at Alexandra Wharf, Southampton, with the help of a bulk discount from property developer and Conservative donor Nicholas James Roach.\n\nIn September 2010, \"The Observer\" reported \"raised eyebrows\" when Hunt's former parliamentary assistant, Naomi Gummer, was given a job within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on a fixed-term civil service contract after Hunt had proposed departmental cuts of 35–50 per cent. The head of the Public and Commercial Services Union questioned Hunt's motives saying, \"Political independence of the civil service is a fundamental part of our democracy and we would be deeply concerned if this was being put at risk by nepotism and privilege.\" Gummer is the daughter of a Conservative life peer, Lord Chadlington, who was a director of Hotcourses between 2000 and 2004.\n\nAs Culture Secretary, Hunt devised and championed a plan to give Britain the fastest broadband speeds in Europe. There was initial scepticism about his plans with concerns they could lead to BT regaining its monopoly. While speeds did increase when he was in office this was, in the main, due to customers switching to different packages. He also spearheaded the drive for local TV and as a result of this policy Ofcom awarded local television licences to Belfast, Birmingham, Brighton & Hove, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Grimsby, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Plymouth, Preston, Sheffield, Southampton, and Swansea. In terms of culture policy, his main focus was to boost philanthropy given the spending cuts that the arts along with other sectors was experiencing. Changes were made to the inheritance tax - including measures to encourage private gifts to the arts.\n\nDuring Hunt's tenure, competition and policy issues relating to media and telecommunications became the responsibility of the Culture Secretary; they were removed from the purview of the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, after Cable was recorded stating that he had \"declared war\" on Rupert Murdoch.\n\nHunt was consequently given the quasi-judicial power to adjudicate over the News Corporation takeover bid for BSkyB. Hunt chose not to refer the deal to the Competition Commission, announcing on 3 March 2011 that he intended to accept a series of undertakings given by News Corporation, paving the way for the deal to be approved. Following a series of scandals concerning phone hacking, a House of Commons motion was planned that called on News Corporation to abandon the bid. The bid was eventually dropped. Hunt was alleged to have had improper contact with News Corp. Emails released to the Leveson Inquiry detailed contacts between Hunt's special advisor Adam Smith and Frédéric Michel, News Corp's director of public affairs and therefore a lobbyist for James Murdoch. The revelations led to calls from the Labour opposition and others for Hunt's resignation. Smith, Hunt's special adviser, resigned on 25 April shortly before Hunt made an emergency parliamentary statement in which he said that Smith's contact with Michel was \"clearly not appropriate\". Hunt said Lord Justice Leveson should be able to investigate and rule on the accusations and requested the earliest date possible to give evidence to the Inquiry to set out his side of the story.\n\nHunt appeared before the Leveson inquiry on 31 May 2012, when it emerged that Hunt had himself been in text and private email contact with James Murdoch. Journalist Iain Martin claimed that at a 2010 event held at UCL which Murdoch attended he saw Hunt hide behind a tree to avoid being seen by journalists: \"I wandered back into the party and ran into one of the organisers. The Culture Secretary is out there hiding behind a tree, I said. We know, came the response, but he doesn’t want to come in because all the media correspondents are here.\" Hunt later told the Leveson Inquiry that \"I thought, this is not the time to have an impromptu interview, so I moved to a different part of the quadrangle...there may or may not have been trees!\"\n\nLord Justice Leveson cleared Hunt of bias when the report was published, stating that \"in some respects, there was much to commend in Mr Hunt's handling of the bid\". He concluded: \"What was not evident from the close consideration of events which the Inquiry undertook was any credible evidence of actual bias on the part of Mr Hunt. Whatever he had said, both publicly and in private, about News Corp or the Murdochs, as soon as he was given the responsibility for dealing with the bid the evidence demonstrates a real desire on his part to get it right. His actions as a decision maker were frequently adverse to News Corp's interests. He showed a willingness to follow Ofcom's advice and to take action, to the extent recommended by the regulators, in response to the consultation.\"\n\nIn June 2010, Hunt attracted controversy for suggesting football hooliganism played a part in the death of 96 football fans in the Hillsborough disaster; when it has been established that a lack of police control and the presence of terraces and perimeter fences were the causes of the tragedy. Margaret Aspinall, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said of Hunt's comments: \"I am very angry that he has shown such ignorance of the facts. He is an absolute disgrace.\" Hunt later apologised saying: \"I know that fan unrest played no part in the terrible events of April 1989 and I apologise to Liverpool fans and the families of those killed and injured in the Hillsborough disaster if my comments caused any offence.\"\n\nIn April 2012, the \"Daily Telegraph\" disclosed that Hunt had reduced his tax bill by over £100,000 by receiving dividends from Hotcourses in the form of property which was promptly leased back to the company. The dividend in specie was paid just before a 10% rise in dividend tax and Hunt was not required to pay stamp duty on the property.\n\nAs Culture Secretary, Hunt was the government minister responsible for the London Olympics and Paralympics. When it transpired that contractors G4S could not provide enough security staff for the Games, Hunt announced that soldiers would be drafted in and that he had been forced to \"think again\" about the default use of private contractors. Hunt took the decision to double the budget for the Danny Boyle-directed opening ceremony which received acclaim, and overall the Games were considered a huge success internationally. According to Danny Boyle, the Artistic Director for the opening ceremony, the government initially suggested removing the section of the opening ceremony about the NHS, although Hunt denied this.\n\nThe Games received widespread acclaim for their organisation, with the volunteers, the British military and public enthusiasm praised particularly highly. In the aftermath, Hunt set up the school games as an Olympic Legacy project. Although there was criticism at the time of cuts in the school sports budget, 11,953 schools took part in the School Games in the first year. Hunt also campaigned to increase the emphasis on the importance of the tourism industry, especially the potential of the Chinese tourist market.\n\nHunt was appointed Health Secretary in the 2012 British cabinet reshuffle, succeeding Andrew Lansley. During his tenure, Hunt pursued ambitious reforms to address patient safety, regional variations in premature deaths, health tourism and A&E waiting times. He oversaw increased spending on the NHS but was criticised for controversial reforms, manipulating figures and increased privatisation. He has said he is in favour of reducing the abortion limit from 24 weeks to 12 weeks. He has also been known to have supported homoeopathy but has denied personally being a supporter unless recommended to patients by a doctor.\n\nHunt co-authored a 2005 book calling for the NHS \"to be replaced by a new system of health provision in which people would pay money into personal health accounts, which they could then use to shop around for care from public and private providers. Those who could not afford to save enough would be funded by the state.\" After becoming Health Secretary, Hunt declared patient choice was not key to improving NHS performance, in a major break from a policy favoured by Conservative and Labour governments over the previous 12 years. He stated that \"there are natural monopolies in healthcare, where patient choice is never going to drive change\". Hunt later also defended the universal coverage provided by the NHS against US President Donald Trump, saying \"NHS may have challenges but I'm proud to be from the country that invented universal coverage – where all get care no matter the size of their bank balance\".\nIn 2012, Hunt attempted to downgrade casualty and maternity units in Lewisham. Hunt stated the cuts were necessary because neighbouring South London Healthcare NHS Trust had been losing more than £1m every week. But a campaign led by GP Dr Louise Irvine defeated Hunt in court in 2012 on this issue, with the judge ruling that Hunt acted outside his powers when he announced casualty and maternity units at Lewisham Hospital would be downgraded.\nIn March 2014, Hunt announced the government would not give a recommended 1% pay rise to NHS non-medical staff receiving progression pay (around 55% of total non-medical staff). Following a pre-election report in April 2015 that hospital chiefs shared an average 6% pay rise totalling £35 million, Hunt promised to investigate if the Conservatives won the election.\n\nIn July 2015, Hunt became the subject of the first petition on a new UK government website to reach the threshold of 100,000 signatures required for a petition to be considered for debate in Parliament. The petition called for a debate on a vote of \"No Confidence\" in Hunt as Health Secretary, and ultimately recorded 222,991 signatures leading to a debate on the motion being scheduled in September 2015. However, the Petitions Committee would not have had the power to initiate a vote of no confidence so instead debated the contracts and conditions of NHS staff.\n\nIn 2015, an undercover \"Daily Telegraph\" investigation showed that in some cases locum agencies, Medicare and Team24 owned by Capita were charging some hospitals higher fees than others and giving false company details. The agencies were charging up to 49% of the fee. Hunt criticised those who sought \"big profits\" at the expense of the NHS and taxpayers and promised to \"reduce the margins rip-off agencies are able to generate.\"\n\nIn 2016, Hunt called for a reduction in the number of foreign doctors working in the NHS after the UK left the EU. At the Conservative Party Conference later in the month, Hunt pledged, by 2025, the NHS would be \"self-sufficient in doctors\". He announced an increase of up to 1,500 extra places at medical schools in the UK in 2018, with it being partly funded by an increase in international medical student fees. Hunt also stated UK medical students would be forced to work in the NHS for at least four years or have to repay the cost of their training, around £220,000.\n\nIn July 2015, Hunt indicated he would be prepared to impose a new consultant contract on doctors in England which would remove the opt out for non-emergency work at weekends to prevent \"about 6,000 avoidable deaths\" resulting from \"Monday to Friday culture\" in the NHS and to reintroduce \"a sense of vocation\" in consultants. The comments angered doctors who responded by sharing photographs of themselves working at weekends via social media using the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy. Hunt was criticised by statisticians David Spiegelhalter and David Craven, BMA council chair Mark Porter and Shadow Health Secretary Heidi Alexander for his claims not merely misrepresenting the facts but potentially causing patients to delay hospitals visits and put themselves at risk. His critics described the Hunt Effect where patients who needed medical attention at a weekend had been deterred from doing so because they were persuaded it would be better to wait until a Monday.\n\nIn October 2015, Hunt was accused by the editor of \"The BMJ\" Fiona Godlee of repeatedly misrepresenting a study published in the journal on the weekend effect. He had used the study as evidence when stating reduced staffing levels of doctors at weekends directly led to 11,000 excess deaths. Godlee asserted the study's authors did not specify the excess deaths were avoidable or staffing levels were the cause. The lead author of the study Nick Freemantle stated they did not identify a cause for excess deaths or establish the extent to which they were avoidable. Co-author NHS Medical Director Bruce Keogh in response to Hunt's comments in October stated \"It is not possible to ascertain the extent to which these excess deaths may be preventable\".\n\nIn January 2016, Hunt was criticised by stroke doctors for using out-of-date data to show stroke patients were more likely to die if admitted at weekends. They wrote there had been significant improvements since 2004–12, when Hunt's data came from, and new data showed there was \"no longer any excess of hospital deaths in patients with stroke admitted at the weekend.\" Stroke specialist David Curtis said even the outdated statistics did not support Hunt's claims. In February, a leaked internal report by the Department of Health stated the department was unable to prove a link between increased consultant presence, availability of diagnostic tests, and reducing weekend mortality and length of stay. It highlighted the seven-day NHS could cost an additional £900 million each year, required the recruitment of 11,000 more staff including 4,000 doctors and 3,000 nurses, and community and social services could struggle to handle more discharges at the weekend.\n\nIn May 2016, another study also concluded there was no evidence people were more likely to die in hospitals at the weekend. In August, internal Department of Health risk management documents were leaked. They described 13 major risks in delivering the \"truly seven-day NHS\" pledge promised by the Conservatives prior to the 2015 general election. These included a lack of staff and funding for the policy. The documents also stated no advance impact assessments had been made to show how the policy would affect the delivery of NHS services. Chief executive of NHS Providers Chris Hopson described the seven-day NHS plan as \"impossible to deliver\" due to a lack of funding and staffing. He also highlighted pressures on the NHS with 80% of acute hospitals in England in financial deficit compared to 5% in 2013 and an increase of missed A&E waiting time targets from 10% to 90% in the same time period. In May 2016, a report by the House of Commons public accounts committee criticised Hunt's plan for a seven-day NHS, saying \"no coherent attempt\" had made to understand staffing needs, the plan was \"completely uncosted\", and contained \"serious flaws\".\n\nUnder Hunt, the Department of Health announced they would impose new junior doctors' contracts in England which would extend \"normal hours\" for which doctors would not be paid a premium while increasing their basic pay in a move Hunt said would be cost neutral. In September 2015, the British Medical Association (BMA) said they would not re-enter negotiations unless Hunt dropped his threat to impose the contract and they balloted their members for industrial action. They argued the contract would include an increase in working hours with a relative pay cut of up to 40%. Many junior doctors said they would leave the NHS if the contract was forced through.\n\nHunt tried reassuring the BMA no junior doctor would face a pay cut, before admitting those who worked longer than 56 hours a week would face a fall in pay but said working these long hours was unsafe. In November 2015, he said he would offer a basic pay increase of 11%, but still removing compensation for longer hours. In response, BMA junior doctors committee chair Johann Malawana requested further details of the offer and said \"The increase in basic pay would be offset by changes to pay for unsocial hours, devaluing the vital work junior doctors do at evenings and weekends.\"\n\nOn 19 November 2015, the result of a BMA strike ballot was announced, with 98% voting for full strike action. After the results were announced, BMA council chair Mark Porter appealed to the health secretary to resume negotiations facilitated by Acas. Hunt agreed to discussions overseen by Acas and withdrew his threat to impose a new contract without agreement, and the first day of strike action was called off hours before it was due to start, which was too late to avoid some disruption.\n\nAn agreement was not reached by the junior doctors committee's 4 January 2016 deadline, so the BMA announced a strike would go ahead. The first day of strike action was in January 2016 and involved junior doctors only providing emergency care. Hunt said it was \"unnecessary\", patients could be put at risk and many junior doctors had \"ignored\" the strike call and worked anyway. The BMA responded saying many junior doctors were in work maintaining emergency care as planned. A second day of strike action occurred in February 2016 where doctors again provided only emergency care.\n\nFollowing the first two strikes, Hunt announced he would be unilaterally imposing the new contract without agreement or further negotiation, with NHS trusts instructed to introduce it in August. This followed government chief negotiator David Dalton reporting junior doctors contract negotiations had ceased after his final offer to the BMA had been declined. In response, the BMA announced three 48-hour long strikes and issued a legal challenge over the contract.\n\nFurther talks after the strikes resulted in an agreement to be put to a referendum. In the July referendum, 58% of BMA members rejected the offer. Following this, Johann Malawana resigned and Hunt rejected holding any further talks with the BMA and announced the imposition of the new contract on junior doctors starting from October. In the lead up to his imposition of the contract, Hunt stated publicly and in Parliament his intention and power to do so. This matter was challenged in the High Court by a group of doctors, \"Justice for Health\". Hunt won the case.\n\nIn February 2016, Hunt was polled as the \"most disliked\" frontline British politician. He acknowledged there would be \"considerable dismay\" and announced an urgent inquiry led by Academy of Medical Royal Colleges chair Susan Bailey into junior doctors' morale and welfare. The Academy Trainee Doctors' Group voted unanimously not to participate in the review under the offered terms. He said he had lessons to learn but denied any personal responsibility for the dispute.\n\nHunt was appointed Foreign Secretary in July 2018 following the resignation of Boris Johnson. Hunt said \"My principal job at a time of massive importance for our country is to stand four square behind the Prime Minister so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union based on what was agreed by the Cabinet last week at Chequers.\"\n\nHunt has supported the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen and described Saudi Arabia as a \"very, very important military ally\". In August 2018, Hunt defended Britain's alliance with Saudi Arabia after a bomb dropped on a school bus in Yemen killed 51 people, including 40 children, although he said he was \"deeply shocked\" at the deaths.\n\nIn July 2018, Hunt visited China and met China's foreign minister Wang Yi. Hunt said that the \"UK-China Strategic Dialogue is an important opportunity to intensify our cooperation on shared challenges in international affairs, ranging from global free trade to non-proliferation and environmental challenges, under the UK-China Global Partnership and 'Golden Era' for UK-China relations\".\n\nOn 23 August 2018, Hunt met U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss the 'threat' from Russia and Iran.\n\nDuring the September 2018 Conservative conference, Hunt likened the European Union to the former USSR, saying: \"It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving. The lesson from history is clear: If you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish.\" This comment was strongly criticised.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunt criticised the Xinjiang re-education camps and human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in China, saying: \"British diplomats who visited Xinjiang have confirmed that reports of mass internment camps for Uighur Muslims were 'broadly true'.\"\n\nAmid global outrage over the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Hunt rejected calls to end the UK's arms sales to Saudi Arabia, saying: \"There are jobs in the UK ... at stake so when it comes to the issue of arms sales we have our procedures.\"\n\nIn November 2018, Hunt threatened the United Arab Emirates with \"serious diplomatic consequences\" after it sentenced British research student Matthew Hedges to life in prison for allegedly spying for the UK. Hunt said that the verdict \"is not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom and runs contrary to earlier assurances\". Hedges was released at the end of November, after intense negotiations.\n\nIn February 2019, whilst on a Brexit related visit to Ljubljana, Hunt caused anger by congratulating his hosts on \"making really remarkable transformation from a Soviet vassal state to a modern European democracy.\" In fact Slovenia, as part of Yugoslavia, had previously been non-aligned.\n\nIn February 2019, Hunt urged Germany to lift ban on arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which has been waging the war on Yemen since March 2015, and warned that Germans are risking \"a loss of confidence in Germany’s credibility as a partner\", though he also admitted: \"Over 80,000 children [in Yemen] have died of starvation, there are about a quarter of a million people starving at the moment, and around 20 million people don't have food security – they don't know whether they’re going to be able to get the food they need in the days ahead.\" Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), said that Hunt \"played an utterly central and complicit role in arming and supporting the Saudi-led destruction of Yemen.\"\n\nIn April 2019, Hunt condemned the United States for recognising Israel's 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights, saying: \"We should never recognise the annexation of territory by force. (...) We want Israel to be a success and we consider them to be a great friend but on this we do not agree.\"\n\nFollowing the April 2019 arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London's Ecuadorian Embassy, Hunt thanked the Ecuadorean President Lenín Moreno for his cooperation.\n\nIn June 2019, Hunt stated that he shares the U.S. government's assessment that Iran is to blame for two attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nHunt announced his campaign to become the leader of the Conservative Party on 3 May 2019, following the resignation of Prime Minister Theresa May. On 20 June 2019, he was named one of the final two candidates. Hunt was defeated by Boris Johnson, having secured only one third of the vote.\n\nHunt's campaign was being funded by a close associate to Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.\n\nFollowing Boris Johnson's election victory, Hunt was offered a different role to Foreign Secretary in Johnson's Cabinet but had decided to turn it down. He said on Twitter: \"I would have been honoured to carry on my work at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office but understand the need for a new Prime Minister to choose his team. Boris Johnson kindly offered me another role but after 9 years in Cabinet and over 300 cabinet meetings now is the time to return to the backbenches from where the Prime Minister will have my full support.\"\n\nIn October 2019 he founded Patient Safety Watch, a charity which seeks to establish data to report on patient safety and harm in care, continuing the work on safety he started as Health Secretary. He chairs the organisation and said he planned to invest considerable sums of money into it.\n\nHunt held his seat at the December 2019 general election.\n\nHunt was elected as the new chair of the Health and Social Care Select Committee in January 2020, succeeding Sarah Wollaston who lost her seat in the general election. In February 2020, Hunt called for an inquiry into the National Health Service after the publishing of many reports regarding infant mortality in NHS hospitals.\n\nHunt's wife, Lucia Guo, comes from Xi'an. Hunt first met Guo in 2008 when she was working at Warwick University recruiting Chinese students for the university. Hunt is 11 years older than Guo. They married in July 2009 and have a son and two daughters; Guo and the three children are low-profile and rarely appear in public.\n\nHunt's brother Charlie runs a duvet and linens business.\n\nHunt speaks Japanese, having studied the language for two years while working in Japan as an English language teacher in the 1990s.\n\nHunt has named his personal political heroes as Margaret Thatcher and William Wilberforce. Hunt is a Church of England Christian and a rational optimist.\n\n\n"}

She was elected at the general election of 2005 as the Member of Parliament for St Albans in Hertfordshire, and was re-elected in 2010, 2015 and 2017. She lost her seat to Daisy Cooper, a Liberal Democrat, at the 2019 general election.\n\nMain was born in Cardiff, Wales in 1957. She was state-educated at the Bishop of Llandaff Church in Wales High School in Rookwood Close in Llandaff, Cardiff. She read English at Swansea University obtaining a BA Hons, where she met her first husband, Stephen. She then obtained a PGCE from the University of Sheffield. She moved to the London area, and taught English and drama at an inner London comprehensive school.\n\nMain's political career began in 1999, when she was elected as a town councillor in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire. She served as councillor for Beaconsfield South Ward on South Bucks District Council from 2001 to 2005. \n\nAt the 2005 general election, she was elected as the Member of Parliament for St Albans, defeating the sitting Labour MP Kerry Pollard, achieving a 6.6% swing.\n\nIn November 2005, Main endorsed David Cameron in the Conservative Party leadership election, after originally supporting his rival David Davis.\n\nAt the general election of 2010 she retained her seat with an increased majority, despite a 3.75% swing to the Liberal Democrats. She then increased her majority in 2015 to 12,732 votes, picking up some votes from the Liberal Democrats as part of the collapse of that party's support nationwide.\n\nAt the snap general election of 2017, Main received 43% of the vote, Daisy Cooper (Liberal Democrat) received 32%, Kerry Pollard (Labour) received 23% and Jack Easton (Green Party) received 2%. UKIP declined to stand a candidate in recognition of Main's eurosceptic views. She became Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Bangladesh, and served on a number of Select Committees; in addition she became a member of the Panel of Chairs. At the 2016 EU Referendum, Main campaigned for a \"Leave\" vote.\n\nMain largely voted in accordance with her party, but rebelled over Brexit (which she supports), high-speed rail (which she opposes) and equal rights for gay marriage (which she opposes).\n\nAgainst the national swing, she lost her seat to the Liberal Democrat candidate Daisy Cooper at the 2019 general election.\n\nMain was investigated by \"The Daily Telegraph\" in May 2009 for claiming a second home allowance and a council tax discount for an apartment for a constituency home, which was also lived in full-time and rent-free by her daughter. On 26 June 2009, it was reported that she would face a Parliamentary inquiry into these allegations under John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, following a formal complaint thought to be from a constituent.\n\nIn February 2010, Lyon concluded that the public should not have been expected to meet living costs for Main's daughter, and Main was ordered to repay £7,100 (being £2,100 wrongly claimed for food, along with an additional £5,000 to reflect the daughter's use of the flat), and to provide a written apology to the committee. Main had argued the Fees Office had told her it was permissible for her daughter to share the second home.\n\nMain claimed £22,000 a year for a second home, despite being able to commute both from her taxpayer-funded flat in St Albans, 26 miles from Westminster, or from her family house in Beaconsfield, 31 miles from Westminster.\n\nConcerns raised in connection with her parliamentary expenses resulted in an attempt by the local St Albans Conservative Association to deselect her, with a local party vote led by the association's chairwoman, Seema Kennedy, a future Member of Parliament who served as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Immigration under Boris Johnson. On 13 August 2009, the local association voted by a large margin (140 to 20 according to some sources) to retain her as its candidate for the forthcoming general election, which had to be held before 3 June 2010.\n\nMain lives with her family in Beaconsfield. She married her first husband Stephen Tonks in 1978, and they had a son and two daughters. Stephen Tonks died of cancer aged 34. In 1995 she married Andrew Jonathan Main, a director of IT, with whom she had a fourth child.\n\n"}

He lost his seat at the 2017 general election to Conservative Party candidate Jack Brereton.\n\nFlello was born in Bournville, Birmingham. He attended Bournville Junior and Infant schools before going to King's Norton Boys' School. At age 18 he went to University of Wales, Bangor to read Chemistry. He graduated in 1987 with a B.Sc (Hons).\n\nAfter graduating, Flello worked for a short time at Cadbury in Bournville before joining the Inland Revenue. In 1989 he left to join Price Waterhouse accountants as a personal tax advisor. In 1995 he moved to Arthur Andersen. In 1999, he co-founded Platts Flello Limited, tax and financial advisors. In late 2003 he left to work as the CEO of Malachi Community Trust until December 2004.\n\nFlello was elected as a councillor to the Longbridge ward of Birmingham City Council in 2002, stepping down in 2004. He is a former chairman of the Birmingham Northfield Constituency Labour Party. He served as a governor at the Newman College in Bartley Green, and was Chair of Governors for both Colmers Farm infants and junior schools. He was also a governor at The Meadows primary school. He served as a regional organiser for the Labour Party in 2004 until his election to Westminster.\n\nFlello was elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for Stoke-on-Trent South following the retirement of George Stevenson. Flello held the seat with a majority of 8,681 and made his maiden speech on 19 May 2005.\n\nIn parliament he was a member of the Science and Technology Select Committee. While Labour were in government he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary first to the Lord Chancellor, Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton, then to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Hazel Blears, and finally after 2009 to the Secretary of State for Defence, Bob Ainsworth.\n\nIn June 2016, Labour Party activists in Stoke-on-Trent South proposed a motion of no confidence in Flello after he called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to \"do the decent thing and resign\". He had supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.\n\nIn 2019 he defected to the Lib Dems and was selected as their parliamentary candidate for his old seat. 36 hours after his selection, however, the Lib Dems deselected Flello, citing \"how greatly his values diverge from ours\". It is believed that they objected to his socially conservative views on abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nFlello is a convert to Catholicism and stated in 2014 \"I could no more leave my faith at the door of the House of Commons than I could my name or my gender or my arms and legs\". He was a member of the anti-abortion All-Party Parliamentary Pro-Life Group. Flello also opposes same-sex marriage and was one of the few Labour MPs to vote against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, citing his religious views.\n\nIn 2007 Flello was accused of filibustering a fellow Labour backbencher's private members bill. The bill, introduced by neighbouring Staffordshire MP Paul Farrelly, aimed to give temporary and agency workers similar employment rights to permanent staff. It was backed by the Unite trade union. The incident provoked an angry response in the \"Daily Mirror\".\n\nIn 2017, Flello blamed \"shocking congestion\" in London on the loss of tarmac from building cycle lanes, which received a critical response from bike charity the London Cycling Campaign and cycling website road.cc, both pointing out that tarmac had been repurposed to another form of transport and that the increased number of journeys overall in Central London were what was causing congestion, not the segregated cycle tracks that are on less than 1% of London roads.\n\n"}
{"id": "1873633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873633", "title": "John Power (musician)", "text": "John Power (musician)\n\nJohn Timothy Power (born 14 September 1967) is an English singer, songwriter and rhythm guitarist, best known as the frontman of Cast. He was previously the bassist and backing vocalist for the La's from 1986 to 1991. Following the dissolution of Cast in 2001, Power embarked on a solo career. In 2005, he briefly reunited with the La's, who split up again without releasing new material. Cast reformed in 2010, releasing the album \"Troubled Times\" in March 2012, followed by \"Kicking Up the Dust\" in April 2017. Power was born in Allerton, Liverpool.\n\nHaving previously struggled to find a permanent bass player since their formation, the La's recruited then 18-year-old John Power in July 1986 after he met Mike Badger at a course for unemployed musicians. Whilst still quite inexperienced on bass guitar, Power was mentored by Lee Mavers (a former bass player himself) and the core trio of Mavers, Badger and Power rehearsed and performed extensively until December 1986 when Badger left the band. The La's fanbase grew rapidly after the arrival of Power and the group recorded some of the demos which helped them gain a record deal the following year.\n\nFor the remainder of the La's' history, the band's line-up would change frequently with a constant duo of Lee Mavers (guitar, vocals) and John Power (bass, backing vocals) and various other guitarists and drummers. Power played on the band's early singles \"Way Out\" (1987) and \"There She Goes\" (1988) and was part of the recording of the band's debut album \"\"The La's\"\" released in 1990.\n\nWhilst in the La's, John Power emerged as a songwriter himself and two Power-written songs \"Alright\" and \"Follow Me Down\" were performed live by the band during 1991. Following increased tension between Power and Lee Mavers, John Power left the La's in December 1991 and he went on to form Cast the following year.\n\nIt was then announced in 2005, that the La's were to reform for a series of headline and festival appearances in the UK, Ireland and Japan. Following these gigs and with no sign of new La's material, Power returned to his solo career.\n\nAfter leaving the La's in 1991 to form Cast, with whom he sang, played guitar and wrote songs, after four albums and a string of hit singles, Cast split in 2002.\n\nAfter undertaking a solo \"Cast Acoustic Show\" tour in June 2010, Cast announced they would reform to work on new material and tour in November/December 2010.\n\nFollowing the split, Power released the John Leckie produced solo album, \"Happening for Love\" in June 2003. Power would later comment on the album that \"\"after the demise of Cast, I was still writing Cast-like tracks, but without the verve I had when I believed in it. \"\n\nFollowing the La's reformation, Power went on to release 2 further solo albums, more in the acoustic folk vein on the Tanuki Tanuki label (set up by former La's A&R man and his then manager Jona Cox.), \"Willow She Weeps\" in October 2006 and \"Stormbreaker\" in January 2008. From 2006 to 2009, Power performed live with the John Power Band featuring backing musicians Jay Lewis (bass, slide guitar) and Steve Pilgrim (drums). Oli Hughes replaced Pilgrim as drummer after he left to play with Paul Weller. In 2013, Power played John Lennon in Bob Eaton's musical \"Lennon\" at the Royal Court Theatre. As of 2015, John is again performing a solo acoustic tour alongside Jay Lewis with a set of July dates scheduled in North West England.\n\nPower grew up in Allerton, Liverpool near Penny Lane and attended Quarry Bank Comprehensive School. Power is a passionate supporter of Liverpool F.C. and has been keenly involved in the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. Power sang the lead vocal on the 2009 recording of \"The Fields of Anfield Road\", commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. Power married Belinda Lang in 1995. They have two children, son Timothy Jaden Power (born 1998) and daughter Poppy Louisa Power (born 2001). They live in Liverpool.\n\nIn November 2019, along with 34 other musicians, Power signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2019 UK general election with a call to end austerity.\n\n"}

Minney.\n\nThe film, directed by Lewis Gilbert, is based on the true story of Special Operations Executive agent Violette Szabo, GC, who was captured and executed while serving in Nazi-occupied France. Szabo was played by Virginia McKenna.\n\nViolette Bushell is a young woman whose father is English, and whose mother is French, living in London early in the Second World War. She meets French Army officer Etienne Szabo, stationed in the city, and they become engaged to be married. They have a daughter, Tania, but Etienne never sees the child, as he is killed fighting in the North African front; Violette Szabo and her daughter move into her parents' home.\n\nBecause of her linguistic skills, the widowed Szabo is recruited as a spy by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) for operations in France. On her first mission, she is teamed with Captain Tony Fraser (Paul Scofield), a man she had met earlier socially and liked. She arrives by small plane in France, and shares a train compartment to Rouen with curious German soldiers. The French Resistance group Fraser had set up in Rouen has been betrayed. The job of the new arrivals is to contact any survivors and to blow up a major railway viaduct. One Resistance member who Szabo contacts tells her that another survivor, a garage mechanic (André Maranne), is suspect, but Szabo takes the risk of meeting him anyway. He informs her that only three of 98 group members remain. Nonetheless, she persuades him to try to blow up the viaduct. Szabo is picked up and questioned by the Gestapo. She is released, and meets in Paris with Fraser, who congratulates her: The viaduct was destroyed.\n\nThey return to Britain, and Szabo reluctantly agrees to another mission. Once again, she is under Fraser's command, this time in the Limoges region. She sets out with a guide to contact the various Resistance units to coordinate their actions. She and her guide become involved in a firefight with German soldiers. They are outnumbered and they flee. Szabo injures her ankle, and she insists on remaining behind. She runs out of ammunition and is captured.\n\nThough tortured, she defiantly refuses to provide any information. Eventually she is reunited with two fellow women agents she had befriended during their initial training, Lilian Rolfe and Denise Bloch, in a Nazi prison. As Allied forces advance on Paris, the women are placed on a train for Germany. When the train is bombed by Allied aircraft, the women have a chance to attempt to escape, but Szabo instead fetches water for male prisoners. One of them is Fraser. That night, Szabo and Fraser acknowledge their love for each other.\n\nThe men and women are separated. The three women are taken to a concentration camp, where they are executed.\n\nAfter the war, Tania and her grandparents go to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI gives the child her mother's posthumous George Cross. Afterwards, they meet Fraser.\n\n\nDon Sharp directed second unit.\n\nThe film was one of the twelve most popular at the British box office in 1958. \"Kinematograph Weekly\" listed it as being \"in the money\" at the British box office in 1958.\n\n\nWith her blonde hair and handsome angular features, Virginia McKenna bears no resemblance to the real Violette Szabo, a pretty if not ravishing brunette with dark eyes standing at less than 5 ft 5in tall. McKenna gives Szabo a marked south London accent brushed with received pronunciation, her performance being in the tradition of the \"stiff upper lipped\" strictly class-structured heroine that would be anticipated by audiences in the atmosphere of a pre-Bond 1950s Britain. The film itself, released in 1958, does not show the full horror of Szabo's treatment in captivity, especially in Ravensbrück concentration camp, or the true manner of her execution, but it gives a broad impression of her bravery and fortitude.\n\nSzabo was described in the citation to her posthumous George Cross as having shown a \"magnificent example of courage and steadfastness\", by her daughter, Tania, in the title of her 2007 book about her mother's missions, as \"young, brave, and beautiful\", and by fellow SOE agent, Odette Sansom, GC, who survived Ravensbrück, as \"the bravest of us all\".\n\nDenise Bloch and Lilian Rolfe were fellow SOE agents, and were executed with Violette Szabo on 5 February 1945 in Ravensbrück. Colonel Maurice Buckmaster was head of SOE F Section; Vera Atkins was his assistant and the section's intelligence officer, with special responsibility for female agents.\n\nVera Atkins, Odette Sansom, and Leslie Fernandez, one of Szabo's SOE instructors and a field agent himself, were advisors on the film.\n\nThe role played by Paul Scofield, \"Tony Fraser\", was created for dramatic purposes, but is based upon Szabo's actual male colleague on her missions to France, and organiser of the Salesman circuit, Philippe Liewer ('Major Charles Staunton').\n\nThe poem, \"The Life That I Have\", also known as \"Yours\", recited to Violette by her husband Etienne, was once believed to have been written especially for the film, but was in fact the actual code poem given to her in March 1944 by the SOE cryptographer Leo Marks, and written by him on Christmas Eve 1943 in memory of his girlfriend, Ruth, who had recently died in a plane crash. Marks, who became a scriptwriter after the war, would only let the poem be used on condition that his authorship was not revealed.\n\n"}

She attended Cefn Saeson Comprehensive School on Afan Valley Road in Cimla, Neath. James married at age 16 and had two children by age 20. Living as a young housewife, James said: \"As long as my lace curtains were the cleanest, my children immaculately dressed, their hand-knitted clothes made with love, I was happy.\"\n\nDuring the 1984 Miners' Strike, James helped feed over 1,000 families a week from nine different centres.

{"id": "1873649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873649", "title": "South African Defence Force", "text": "South African Defence Force\n\nThe South African Defence Force (SADF) comprised the South African armed forces from 1957 until 1994. Shortly before the state reconstituted itself as a republic in 1961, the former Union Defence Force was officially succeeded by the SADF, which was established by the Defence Act (No. 44) of 1957. The SADF, in turn, was superseded by the South African National Defence Force in 1994.\n\nThe SADF was organised to perform a dual mission: to counter possible insurgency in all forms, and to maintain a conventional military arm which could defend the republic's borders, making retaliatory strikes as necessary. As the military expanded during the 1970s, the SADF general staff was organised into six sections—finance, intelligence, logistics, operations, personnel, and planning; uniquely, the South African Medical Service (SAMS) was made co-equal with the South African Army, the South African Navy and the South African Air Force.\n\nThe military was mostly composed of white South Africans, who alone were subject to conscription. However, Black were the 2nd largest and were Asians and Coloured citizens with mixed ancestry were eligible to serve as volunteers, several even attaining commissioned rank. From 1971 onwards several Black battalions were raised in the Infantry and Service Corps on a tribal basis, and most Black soldiers served in these exclusive tribal Battalions, which had Black NCOs but White commissioned officers. The first Black personnel were accepted into commissioned ranks only from 1986, and then only for serving Black soldiers and NCOs. The regular Commission would not be open for Bantus until 1991, and then again they would serve only in Black units or Support/Service Support units, to avoid having position of authority over White combat arms personnel. The first Black officer to be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel rank and have command over a Battalion sized unit was only appointed in February 1994, by which time the old SADF was already on its deathbed. However, Black officer candidates from the various Homeland Forces and from South West Africa/SWATF had been accepted since 1981 Units such as the 32 Battalion incorporated many black volunteers, as did the 101 Battalion. Conscription was opposed by organisations such as the End Conscription Campaign, but overall, white morale remained high—as indicated by the few recruits tried for serious disciplinary offences.\n\nDuring apartheid, armed SADF troops were used in quelling opposition to minority rule, often directly supporting the South African Police. South African military units were involved in the long-running Mozambican and Angolan civil wars, frequently supporting Pretoria's allies, the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). SADF personnel were also deployed during the related South African Border War.\n\nBefore 1957, the Union of South Africa had relied on small standing cadres for defence, expanding during wartime through the use of white conscripts. During the Second World War the Union Defence Force initially fielded only 3,353 full-time soldiers, with another 14,631 active in reserve roles. These troops were not prepared to fight in Europe proper, as they had hitherto been trained only in basic light infantry tactics and bush warfare. However, Jan Christiaan Smuts proved remarkably resourceful in raising 345,049 men for overseas operations; South African soldiers went on to distinguish themselves as far abroad as Italy and Egypt.\n\nAfter 1957, the new South African Defence Force was faced with a post-war upsurge in African nationalism, and forced to expand its resources accordingly. In 1963 its total strength stood at around 25,000 men. By 1977, the United Nations was imposing arms sanctions on the republic due to its controversial policy of racial apartheid. South Africa responded by developing a powerful domestic arms industry, capable of producing quality hardware, including jet fighters, drones, guided missiles, armoured cars, multiple rocket launchers, and small arms. SADF units fought in the Angolan Civil War during Operation Savannah and were also active alongside Rhodesian Security Forces during the Rhodesian Bush War. Although both campaigns were strategically unsuccessful, it was clearly proven that South Africa's military was immeasurably superior in strength and sophistication than all her African neighbours combined. Further enlargement and modernisation of the armed forces continued under former defence minister Pieter Willem Botha, who became state president in 1984. Shortly after Botha took office, the SADF numbered some 83,400 men (including 53,100 conscripts and 5,400 non-whites): one armoured brigade, one mechanised infantry brigade, four motorised brigades, one parachute brigade, a special reconnaissance regiment, one Marine brigade, twenty artillery regiments, supporting specialist units, a balanced air force, and a navy adequate for coastal protection in all. In addition, numerous auxiliary formations were trained as support units capable of occupying strategic border areas, including the predominantly Angolan 32 Battalion, Namibia's South West African Territorial Force, and several Bantustan militias.\n\nDuring Botha's term, the SADF began focusing on taking a more aggressive stance to the ongoing war against communist-supported nationalist guerrillas in South Africa and Namibia (then South West Africa) and targeting neighboring countries that offered them support. This was partially justified as a new structure intended to turn back a \"total onslaught\" on the republic from abroad. The post-colonial rise of newly independent black governments on the apartheid administration's doorstep created a perceived menace to the existing structure, and Pretoria's occupation of Namibia threatened to bring it into direct confrontation with the world community. On the ground, militant guerrilla movements such as the African National Congress (ANC), South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) challenged white supremacy with force of arms. In 1984, at least 6,000 such insurgents were being trained and armed by Tanzania, Ethiopia, the Soviet Union, and Warsaw Pact member states.\n\nIn general the struggle went badly for South Africa's opponents. Mozambique provided support and shelter to ANC operatives; in retaliation South African units launched massive counterstrikes which the local security forces were in no position to block. Military aircraft and special forces units deployed across Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, and Zambia to attack suspected insurgent bases. 30,000 South African military personnel were posted on the Namibian border by late 1985, frequently crossing the frontier to battle SWAPO groups operating from southern Angola. SWAPO's MPLA allies, with the backing of the Cuban military, were often unable to protect them. These raids reflected the SADF's talent for combating rural insurgency. Major guerrilla camps were always chief targets, whether on foreign or domestic soil. Consequently, establishing good intelligence and effective assault strategy were commonly reflected in tactical priorities.\n\nThe SADF's success eventually compelled SWAPO to withdraw over 200 miles from the Namibian border, forcing their insurgents to travel great distances across arid bush in order to reach their targets. Many could no longer carry heavy weapons on these treks, occasionally abandoning them as they marched south. Moreover, serious SWAPO losses were already having a negative effect on morale. ANC operations fared little better. Most high-profile terrorist attacks were foiled or offered negative publicity from a normally sympathetic international stage. While it was clear that popular support was growing and guerrilla skills were being improved upon, affrays on South Africa itself did not seriously disrupt the economy or impact the country's superior military and industrial status.\n\nBy the fall of apartheid in 1991, the SADF was an uneven reflection of both the strengths and weaknesses of South Africa's white society at large. It employed many personnel with developed technical skills; thus, the military could more easily maintain and operate sophisticated hardware than black African forces drawn from underdeveloped regions. In an unusual contrast with Southern Africa's other white armies, the SADF had a stern sense of bureaucratic hierarchy. Commanders deferred to civilian supervisors and normally could not aspire to political power. The SADF's technical performance had also improved greatly, owing largely to realistic and efficient training procedures. The army in particular was skilled in both counterinsurgency warfare and conventional mechanised operations. In 1984, 11,000 infantrymen were even trained to execute blitzkrieg tactics. White soldiers were for the most part reasonably motivated; conscripts had a sense of defending their own country rather than some far-off foreign venture. Commissioned officers generally accepted in principle recruits of all colours, placed an emphasis on technical efficiency, and preferred to fight a foreign rather than domestic enemy despite extensive preparation for both.\n\nAs non-racial democracy was introduced to the republic in 1994, the SADF was amalgamated with the formerly independent Bantustan security forces, the ANC's Umkhonto we Sizwe, PAC's Azanian People's Liberation Army and the 'self-protection units' of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) to form the South African National Defence Force.\n\nThe State President was the Commander-in-Chief of the SADF with:\n\n\nStaff Divisions under the Chief of Defence Staff included:\n\n\nOther Support Services commands included:\n\n\n\nPrior to amalgamation, the SADF had the following force:\n\nPlus\n\nSouth Africa at one time possessed nuclear weapons, but its stockpile was dismantled during the political transition of the early 1990s.\n\n"}

He campaigned for Brexit in the EU Referendum and is part of the political advisory board of Leave Means Leave.\n\nBone was born in 1952 in Billericay and educated at Westcliff High School for Boys until 1971 then Chart Tutors – now part of Kaplan – till 1974.\n\nBone qualified as a chartered accountant in 1976. According to Conservative Home Bone has \"run both a public company and a family business.\"\n\nIn 1995, according to \"The Guardian\", Bone was described as Britain's \"meanest boss\" by the \"Daily Mirror\" when he defended paying a 17-year-old trainee at Palm Travel (West) 87p an hour. By way of context, the average wage was over £8 per hour in 1995. While appearing on the British satirical television programme \"Have I Got News for You\", Bone, to laughter, said the \"Mirror\"s claim was \"wholly correct\" but pointed out that the wage in question was part of a \"government training scheme\", paying \"£30 a week\".\n\nIn 1978, Bone was elected as a councillor for the Blenheim ward on Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, where he served for eight years until 1986. He was elected as the Deputy Chairman of the Southend West Conservative Association in 1977 and continued in the position until 1984. In 1982, he became press secretary to the Conservative MP Paul Channon.\n\nHe unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat of Islwyn in the South Wales valleys at the 1992 general election against the then Leader of the Opposition Neil Kinnock. He subsequently fought the European Parliament election in 1994 for Mid and West Wales coming third and suffering a swing against his party of 7.5%.\n\nBone was a member of the National Union Executive Committee between 1993 until 1996. He was chosen for the seemingly safe Conservative seat of Pudsey following the retirement of the veteran MP Giles Shaw at the 1997 general election but lost following a swing of 13.20% to the Labour's Paul Truswell, compared to a national swing of 10% from Conservative to Labour.\n\nIn the 2001 general election he fought the ultra-marginal seat of Wellingborough, where the sitting Labour MP Paul Stinchcombe was holding on with a majority of just 187, having defeated the veteran Tory MP Peter Fry in 1997. Stinchcombe held on to his seat by 2,355, a swing of 2.1% to Labour compared with a national swing of 1.75% to the Conservatives. However, four years later, in the 2005 general election, Bone ousted Stinchcombe in Wellingborough with a majority of 687 votes, a swing of 2.9% compared to a national swing of 3.1% to the Conservatives. He made his maiden speech on 7 June 2005.\n\nEarly on in his career he was described as one of the most active MPs in Parliament, in terms of Questions asked and other contributions. However, the quality of those interventions was questioned in a 2006 article in \"The Times\" about the Theyworkforyou website. Bone was one of three MPs specifically alleged to have \"boosted their ratings on the internet by saying very little, very often.\" Among his 109 speeches was one which ran to three short sentences (standing up for Royal Mail in that a sub-postmaster in Little Irchester had the only business in the village). He regularly referenced his then wife \"Mrs Bone\" in questions to the Prime Minister's Questions.\n\nBone is a member of the 1922 Committee and was an executive member from 2007 to 2012. In April 2012, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that the modernising \"301 Group\" was planning a coup to replace Bone and others. Bone was voted off the executive in May 2012.\n\nIn March 2009, Bone was one of the key speakers opposing the use of the House of Commons by the UK Youth Parliament, having been appointed one of the Tellers.\n\nAlthough Bone was not mentioned in the 2009 \"Legg Report\" that was central to the official investigation into the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal and therefore was not one of the 343 MPs required to pay back any money, he was subject to some later controversies relating to his expenses. He was one of 32 MPs who claimed the maximum allowance of £4,800 a year for food in 2010 and came under investigation in 2014 for expenses claims relating to the upkeep of his second home. In 2016 he was reported to be one of 26 MPs who had expenses debts of up to £500 written off after failing to pay them by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and in 2016 was criticised for using the government's help-to-buy scheme, which was meant to help young first time buyers, to buy himself a new constituency home.\n\nBone proposed a bill in July 2013, arguing that the August Bank Holiday should be renamed to Margaret Thatcher Day to commemorate her premiership. The bill ran out of time, due to filibustering by Labour MPs and formally ended its passage through Parliament in 2014.\n\nBone was frequently critical of the Coalition Government between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats and is rated as one of the Conservatives' most rebellious MPs.\n\nIn February 2014, \"The Times\" newspaper reported that Bone had been under investigation by the Police for the previous 12 months relating to an alleged £100,000 fraud concerning benefit payments of care home fees for his mother-in-law. Bone issued a lengthy statement denying fraud allegations. In March 2014 the Crown Prosecution Service said it had concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges.\n\nIn the 2015 general election, he increased his majority by 1,347 achieving 52.1% of the votes cast. And was re-elected again in the 2017 general election.\n\nIn February 2018, following the announcement that Northamptonshire County Council had brought in a \"section 114\" notice, putting it in special measures following a crises in its finances, Bone was one of seven local MPs who released a statement arguing that the problems with the authority were down to mismanagement from the Conservative councillors who led it rather than funding cuts from the Conservative Government. They further argued that government commissioners should take over the running of the Council.\n\nIn Parliament, he serves on the Procedure Committee, the Committee on Exiting the European Union and the Panel of Chairs. He has previously been a member of the Trade and Industry Select Committee, the Health Select Committee, the Backbench Business Committee, the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Commons Committee on Statutory Instruments.\n\nBefore they separated, Bone employed his wife, Jennie, as his executive secretary. In 2007–2008 he paid her \"in the top bracket of up to £40,000\" per annum. The practice of MPs employing family members has been criticised by some sections of the media as nepotism. Although MPs who were first elected in 2017 have been banned from employing family members, the restriction is not retrospective – meaning that Bone's employment of his wife was lawful.\n\nIn June 2018, Bone defended fellow Conservative MP Christopher Chope after he was widely criticised for blocking a government-backed bid to make it illegal to take photos of people aimed up their skirts. Bone argued that Chope was \"a great parliamentarian and public servant\".\n\nBone is regarded as being on the right wing of the Conservative Party, and is a member of the socially conservative Cornerstone Group. He has suggested major constitutional changes such as abolition of the Whips office and confirmation of new Cabinet appointees. His criticisms of the NHS include a 2007 report in which he argued that it \"would not be out of place in Stalin's Russia\". He has voted to lower the abortion time limit to twelve weeks and voted against abolishing the offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel. He has urged the Charity Commission to award the tax breaks of registration to any legal faith group. The abortion time limit vote failed, the blasphemy vote passed, and tax breaks were not awarded.\n\nBone opposed the introduction of the National Minimum Wage, which he claimed would \"condemn hundreds of thousands to the dole queue\", and later backed a private member's bill tabled by his colleague Christopher Chope proposing to enable employees to opt out of the minimum wage.\n\nBone described government proposals to introduce same-sex marriage rights as \"completely nuts\". He subsequently voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Bone was one of four MPs who camped outside Parliament in a move to facilitate parliamentary debate on what they called an \"Alternative Queen's Speech\" – an attempt to show what a future Conservative government might deliver. 42 policies were listed including reintroduction of the death penalty and conscription, privatizing the BBC, banning the burka in public places and preparation to leave the European Union. The \"Daily Telegraph\" believes the whips sent Edward Leigh to try to persuade the group not to table the amendments. Bone blamed the Liberal Democrats for tying David Cameron's hands.\n\nA prominent Eurosceptic, Bone has often been named as a potential defector to the United Kingdom Independence Party. Bone described UKIP's emergence as a \"good thing for British politics\", and criticised his own party for \"neglecting\" the views of traditional Conservatives on other issues such as immigration, but said he intended to campaign for withdrawal from the EU from within the Conservative Party. Bone is a director of Grassroots Out and was a director of the now dissolved Go Movement Limited with Nigel Farage and Tom Pursglove.\n\nIn 2009, Bone said: \"We have gone from having one of the best health services in the Western world to arguably the worst\", which had \"centralised and Stalinist management\".\n\nIn March 2019, Bone was one of 21 MPs who voted against LGBT inclusive sex and relationship education in English schools.\n\nIn September 2019, Bone expressed his beliefs that a general election would be a \"good thing\" and a necessary step in order to establish a \"Conservative government with a majority\" and prevent a no-deal Brexit. Bone also protested against a motion to debate attempts to stop Boris Johnson from taking the United Kingdom out of the European Union without a deal.\n\nBone has also criticised his fellow Conservative party members for refusing to support Boris Johnson's victory in the leadership race for a Prime Minister. Despite winning the vote, 21 Conservative MPs voted against him, a move which Bone has criticised, according to the \"Daily Express\". Bone has been quoted saying that Boris Johnson would be an \"excellent prime minister and get a proper Brexit deal and lead us to victory in the next general election\".\n\nBone primarily lives in London, but also owns a flat in the Denington Estate (formally John Lea School site) in Wellingborough. He married Jeanette Sweeney in 1981; together they had two sons and a daughter. Bone separated from his wife, who is a Conservative Councillor in the Borough of Wellingborough and his Executive Secretary, in 2016 and is now in a relationship with physiotherapist Helen Harrison, who is now his new Executive Secretary.\n\nBone played cricket as a left-arm bowler for Cambridge Methodists Cricket Club in Leeds, and has tweeted in the past of his matches playing with Wellingborough Old Grammarians 3rd XI, despite not actually being a member of the club. Bone has also played cricket as a member of a Parliamentarians team, alongside Crispin Blunt and Hugh Robertson. He is an active member of the Church of England and attends St Mary's Church in Rushden, as well as holding constituency surgeries in the church hall.\n\n"}

He was educated at Addey and Stanhope School and has a BSc, degree in agricultural economics from Wye College.\n\nAfriyie has seven half-siblings and one brother. He said of his upbringing: \"I never knew my father until I was much older and my mother, Gwen, brought us up alone. She was my rock, the gel at the centre of my life, although her tumultuous relationships with different men made for a constant state of flux at the boundaries of our family.\"\n\nAfriyie is chairman of Connect Support Services, an IT support company he set up in 1993. He owned two thirds of DeHavilland, a political monitoring company, which was sold to publishers Emap in 2005 for £18 million.

He is the son of Annie and James McFadden, both native Irish language speakers from the Falcarragh area of northern County Donegal in Ulster, Ireland. As a child he regularly visited Donegal. He went to Holy Cross RC Primary School on Calder Street and Holyrood Secondary School in Crosshill, south-east Glasgow. McFadden studied Politics at the University of Edinburgh, gaining a BA in 1988, and was chair of Scottish Labour Students in 1986–87 before becoming a researcher in 1988 for Donald Dewar, then Labour's Scottish Affairs spokesman. In 1993 he left this role to become a speechwriter and policy adviser to the Labour leader John Smith.\n\nPrior to becoming an MP, he worked in several advisory roles for Tony Blair, both in opposition and government, and was the Prime Minister's Political Secretary from 2002.\n\nMcFadden was elected as the MP for Wolverhampton South East at the 2005 general election, with a majority of 10,495, after Dennis Turner retired.\n\nIn the 2006 reshuffle he was appointed as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Exclusion at the Cabinet Office. In the 2007 reshuffle he was promoted to Minister of State in the then newly created Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform with responsibility for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs. In October 2008, when Lord Mandelson replaced John Hutton as Business Secretary, McFadden took on duties as his deputy in order to represent the department in the House of Commons as Mandelson is a peer and can only address the Lords. McFadden was contemporaneously appointed to the Privy Council.\n\nFollowing Labour's defeat in the 2010 election and the resignation of Gordon Brown, McFadden was named in interim leader Harriet Harman's shadow cabinet as Shadow Business Secretary.\n\nWhen Ed Miliband was elected as Labour leader in September 2010, McFadden announced his decision to stand in Labour's shadow cabinet election but was not elected. However, when he reshuffled his Shadow Cabinet in 2014, Miliband appointed him as shadow minister for Europe.\n\nIn the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, he nominated Liz Kendall.\n\nHe retained his post when Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader but was sacked along with Michael Dugher in January 2016. He was sacked for what the leadership described as repeated acts of disloyalty, including when, responding to a Stop the War article on the Paris bombings, he condemned \"the view that sees terrorist acts as always being a response or a reaction to what we in the west do\". John McDonnell said that McFadden's remarks, expressed in a question to the Prime Minister and interpreted as an attack on Corbyn, were an example of him undermining the leader's view. McFadden was defended by Ian Austin and Chris Leslie. Jonathan Reynolds and Stephen Doughty expressed support for McFadden in their resignation letters the following day.\n\nHe supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.\n\nHe voted in favour of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill to trigger Article 50 and exit the European Union. He is opposed to a no deal Brexit which he believes will make the country poorer and supports a close trading relationship with the European Union. He was in favour of a second referendum to give the people a final say on leaving the European Union.\n\nHe is part of Open Britain (a British pro-European campaign group) and defended Tony Blair's pro-European speech on February 2017. He is associated with the Labour right wing Labour First grouping and is a vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel.\n\nOn 9 April 2020, McFadden was appointed as Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury by new party leader Keir Starmer.\n\nMcFadden and his wife, Marianna, have a son and a daughter.

Her works have sold 50 million copies internationally.\n\nTourtel was born Mary Caldwell, the youngest child of Samuel Caldwell, a stained-glass artist and stonemason, and his wife Sarah. Mary studied art under Thomas Sidney Cooper at the Sidney Cooper School of Art in Canterbury (now the University for the Creative Arts), and became a children's book illustrator. In 1900 she married an assistant editor of \"The Daily Express\", Herbert Bird Tourtel, at Eton. Rupert Bear was created in 1920, at a time when the \"Express\" was in competition with \"The Daily Mail\" and its then popular comic strip \"Teddy Tail\", as well as the strip \"Pip, Squeak and Wilfred\" in \"The Daily Mirror\". The then news editor of the \"Express\", Herbert Tourtel, was approached with the task of producing a new comic strip to rival those of the \"Mail\" and \"Mirror\" and immediately thought of his wife Mary, already an established author and artist. Rupert Bear was the result and was first published as a nameless character in a strip titled \"Little Lost Bear\" on 8 November 1920. The early strips were illustrated by Mary and captioned by her husband, and were published as two cartoons a day with a short story underneath. Rupert was originally a brown bear until the \"Express\" cut inking expenses giving him his iconic and characteristic white colour. Mary’s Rupert was more like a real bear, with a lumbering gait and more fur. The vibrant red and yellow clothing of contemporary Rupert was originally a soft blue jumper with grey trousers. \n\nIn 1931 Herbert Tourtel died in a German sanatorium, and Mary retired four years later in 1935 after her eyesight and general health deteriorated. The Rupert Bear strips were continued by a \"Punch\" illustrator, Alfred Bestall. Mary lived most of her life in different hotels, never finding a fixed home as she preferred the freedom of travel. \n\nMary Tourtel died on 15 March 1948, aged 74, at the Kent and Canterbury Hospital, a week after she collapsed in Canterbury High Street from a brain tumour. She was buried with her husband at St Martin's Church, Canterbury; they had no children but travelled the world together. In 2003, the Canterbury Heritage Museum, which closed in 2018, opened a special wing dedicated to Rupert Bear. There is now a Rupert display case in the Beaney House of Art and Knowledge, alongside the Clangers.\n\nThe complete listing may be found at Rupert Little Bear Library.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a minimalist film about a man who drives through a city suburb, in search of someone who can carry out the task of burying him after he commits suicide. It was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, which it shared with The Eel.\n\nMr Badii (Homayoun Ershadi), a middle-aged man, drives through Tehran looking for someone to do a job for him, and he offers a large amount of money in return. During his drives with prospective candidates, Badii reveals that he plans to kill himself and has already dug the grave. He needs someone to throw earth on his body, after his death. He does not discuss why he wants to commit suicide.\n\nHis first recruit is a young, shy Kurdish soldier, who refuses to do the job and flees from Badii's car. His second recruit is an Afghan seminarist, who also declines because he has religious objections to suicide. The third is an Azeri taxidermist. He is willing to help Badii because he needs the money for his sick child, but tries to talk him out of it; he reveals that he too wanted to commit suicide a long time ago but chose to live when he tasted mulberries. The Azeri promises to throw earth on Badii if he finds him dead in the morning. That night, Badii lies in his grave while a thunderstorm begins. After a long blackout, the film ends by breaking the fourth wall with camcorder footage of Kiarostami and the film crew filming \"Taste of Cherry\".\n\n\nThe film is minimalist in that it is shot primarily with long takes; the pace is leisurely and there are long periods of ambient (background) sound, which the closing sequence shows the crew recording. Mr. Badii is rarely shown in the same shot as the person he is talking to (this is partly because during the filming, director Kiarostami was sitting in the car's passenger seat).\n\nThe film does not include a background score, except for the ending titles. This features a trumpet piece, Louis Armstrong's 1929 adaptation of \"St. James Infirmary Blues.\" The only song featured in the film is \"Khuda Bowad Yaret\" (May God be your protector) by Afghan singer Ahmad Zaher, which is played in the background on a radio.\n\n\"Taste of Cherry\" was awarded the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival in the year of its release, tied with Shohei Imamura's \"The Eel\".\nWhen the film was released in the United States, however, it met with a split reaction among critics and audiences. Roger Ebert wrote a scathing review in \"The Chicago Sun-Times\", giving the film a mere 1 out of 4 stars. Ebert dismissed the film as \"excruciatingly boring\" and added, \"I understand intellectually what Kiarostami is doing. I am not impatiently asking for action or incident. What I do feel, however, is that Kiarostami's style here is an affectation; the subject matter does not make it necessary, and is not benefited by it. If we're to feel sympathy for Badhi, wouldn't it help to know more about him? To know, in fact, anything at all about him? What purpose does it serve to suggest at first he may be a homosexual? (Not what purpose for the audience--what purpose for Badhi himself? Surely he must be aware his intentions are being misinterpreted.) And why must we see Kiarostami's camera crew--a tiresome distancing strategy to remind us we are seeing a movie? If there is one thing \"Taste of Cherry\" does not need, it is such a reminder: The film is such a lifeless drone that we experience it only as a movie.\" \n\nEbert later went on to add the film to a list of his most hated movies of all time. \n\nIn his own review of Kiarostami's film, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" awarded it a full four stars. Responding to Ebert's criticisms, Rosenbaum wrote: \"A colleague who finds \"Taste of Cherry\" \"excruciatingly boring\" objects in particular to the fact that we don’t know anything about Badii, to what he sees as the distracting suggestion that Badii might be a homosexual looking for sex, and to what he sees as the tired \"distancing strategy\" of reminding us at the end that we’re seeing a movie. From the perspective of the history of commercial Western cinema, he has a point on all three counts. But Kiarostami couldn’t care less about conforming to that perspective, and given what he can do, I can’t think of any reason he should care... the most important thing about the joyful finale is that it’s the precise opposite of a \"distancing effect.\" It does invite us into the laboratory from which the film sprang and places us on an equal footing with the filmmaker, yet it does this in a spirit of collective euphoria, suddenly liberating us from the oppressive solitude and darkness of Badii alone in his grave. Shifting to the soldiers reminds us of the happiest part of Badii’s life, and a tree in full bloom reminds us of the Turkish taxidermist’s epiphany — though the soldiers also signify the wars that made both the Kurdish soldier and the Afghan seminarian refugees, and a tree is where the Turk almost hanged himself. Kiarostami is representing life in all its rich complexity, reconfiguring elements from the preceding 80-odd minutes in video to clarify what’s real and what’s concocted. (The \"army\" is under Kiarostami’s command, but it is Ershadi — an architect friend of the filmmaker in real life — who passes Kiarostami a cigarette.) Far from affirming that \"Taste of Cherry\" is \"only\" a movie, this wonderful ending is saying, among other things, that it’s also a movie. And we don’t have to remember all of the lyrics of \"St. James Infirmary\" to know that death is waiting for us around the corner.\"\n\nSince the film's release, multiple other critics have also declared it a masterpiece; in the British Film Institute's 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" poll, six critics and two directors named \"Taste of Cherry\" one of the 10 best films ever made.\n\nOn June 1, 1999, The Criterion Collection released the film onto DVD. In April 2020, Criterion announced that on July 21, 2020, a 4K restoration of the film would be released on Blu-ray and DVD.\n\n"}

She was Cabinet member for Children and Young People, Early Years and Childcare and Health and Wellbeing. From 2002 to 2004, she was Cabinet member for Education, Children's Social Services and all services for children and young people and Director of a Pathfinder Children's Trust. She is a member of the GMB Union, the Co-operative Party and the Fabian Society.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2005, she worked as a consultant to the charity, the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, researching carers' issues — particularly those related to primary health care. She is co-author of the reports \"Carers Speak Out\" and \"Primary Carers\".\n\nIn the House of Commons, Keeley served as a member of the Constitutional Affairs Select committee and from February 2006, the Finance and Services Committee. On 8 February 2006, she was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Cabinet Office, working with the Cabinet Office Minister, Jim Murphy MP. In June 2006, she moved to be PPS to Jim Murphy as Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nOn 16 December 2006, she won the nomination to be the Labour Party candidate for the constituency of Worsley and Eccles South, following boundary changes affecting Worsley.\n\nIn 2007, she served as the Parliamentary Champion for Carers Week (11 June – 17 June). She introduced a Private Members Bill — The Carers (Identification and Support) Bill — into the House of Commons on 24 April that year. The Bill would have required health bodies to identify patients who are carers or who have a carer and would make provision in relation to the responsibilities of local authorities and schools for the needs of young carers.\n\nIn June 2007, Keeley was appointed as PPS to Harriet Harman as Secretary of State for Women and Equality and appointed by Gordon Brown to chair the Labour Party's manifesto group on Social Care.

In June 2010, she was appointed as a member of the Shadow Health Team and as the Shadow Deputy Leader of the House.\n\nShe stood in the 2010 Shadow Cabinet elections, coming 23rd. She was shadow minister for the Department of Communities and Local Government until October 2011.\n\nShe was appointed a member of the shadow health team in September 2015 as Shadow Minister for Older People, Social Care and Carers.\n\nShe supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.\n\nKeeley is concerned about a fall in the number of psychiatrists treating children and young people in England. She has said, \"These figures are a severe blow to the government’s plans for children and young people’s mental health, which will come to nothing unless the NHS trains and recruits more child psychiatrists.\" She has also said, \"Children in need of mental health services are being turned away in their droves despite showing evidence of self-harm, while many have to wait six months for treatment to start – all because of a shortage of key clinical staff.\"\n\nKeeley is also concerned about poor standards of care in many private care homes after an investigation found, elderly residents soiling themselves because staff did not attend to them in time, residents with autism suffering inappropriate and disproportionate physical force, patients waiting excessively long after ringing bells because staff are under pressure, elderly residents not treated with respect with underwear exposed and faeces smeared on a cushion, patients put at risk of attack from other patients and medicines handled unsafely. She stated, \"This investigation has exposed the appalling standards of care being provided by some of the largest providers of outsourced residential care which has left large numbers of vulnerable people in need of care suffering terrible indignity and neglect.\"\n\nKeeley is further concerned about care workers having their wages docked when they are sick. She has said this is \"symptomatic of our broken care system. (...) Good care quality depends on workers with good terms and conditions, but in hollowing out our social care system through relentless cuts to council budgets, this government has empowered irresponsible providers that are driving down workers’ conditions and at the same time damaging the quality of care.\"\n\nShe is married to Colin Huggett.\n\n"}

It was joined to Switzerland only during the Napoleonic period. It now forms a northwestern extension to the canton of Aargau to the east of Basel, between the High Rhine forming the border with Germany in the north and the Jura Mountains in the south. \n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, Fricktal formed part of the Alemannic \"Augstgau\" between the Rhine and Aar rivers, from the 10th century onwards of the smaller \"Frickgau\" region within Upper Burgundy, owned by the Counts of Homberg-Thierstein in the 11th and 12th centuries. The western Fricktal was held by the Burgundian Lords of Rheinfelden, their last scion Rudolf of Rheinfelden became Duke of Swabia in 1057 and upon his death in 1080 his possessions passed to his son in law Berthold II from the House of Zähringen. After the extinction of the line in 1218, the area eventually passed to the Counts of Habsburg, who already held the \"Vogtei\" of Laufenburg.\n\nAfter the Habsburg dynasty had lost large parts of its original Swabian possessions south of the Rhine to the Swiss Confederacy at the 1386 Battle of Sempach, the remaining Fricktal was administered from the \"Oberamt\" Breisgau of Further Austria (\"Vorderösterreich\") at Freiburg, while the adjacent Unteraargau region to the south was finally conquered by the Swiss at Bern in 1415. In 1469 the indebted Archduke Sigismund of Further Austria sold the Breisgau with Fricktal to the Burgundian Duke Charles the Bold, nevertheless upon Charles' death in 1477 it reverted to Archduke Maximilian I of Habsburg by marriage with the duke's daughter Mary the Rich.\n\nIn the early 18th century, the citizens of Bern attempted to purchase Fricktal from the Habsburg Emperors without success. Subsequent to the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio, France occupied Fricktal, and in 1802 it was briefly a canton of the Helvetic Republic, as the Canton of Fricktal. On 9 March 1803, Fricktal was integrated into the Aargau canton of the Swiss Confederation by order of Napoleon.\n"}

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for The Wrekin in Shropshire since the 2005 general election.\n\nPritchard was born on 22 November 1966. He was brought up and educated in Herefordshire. He remarked on BBC Radio 4 that he comes from an \"unorthodox background\" for a Conservative MP. For the first five years of his life he was brought up in an orphanage in Hereford, and later grew up in foster care living in a council house. He told his local newspaper that his early years were years of \"love and warmth\" and that he did not have \"a single bad memory\" of his time in the orphanage.\n\nPritchard was first elected for the Conservative Party as a councillor on Harrow Council in London. Under his former name of Mark Mallon, he was elected as the Conservative Party candidate at a by-election for Pinner West ward in January 1993, but lost his seat at the council elections in May 1994, coming fifth. A supporter of Margaret Thatcher, Pritchard worked as the campaign manager to her successor in the London seat of Finchley, Hartley Booth, who served in Parliament between 1992 – 1997. Pritchard, under his previous name Mallon, co-wrote a book with Booth on the subject of long-term unemployment and homelessness, which they self-published in 1994, shortly after Booth resigned as a parliamentary private secretary following press revelations of a relationship with a House of Commons researcher.\n\nAfter working for Hartley Booth, Pritchard spent a brief period at Conservative Central Office, working as a press officer, in the 1997 General Election campaign. He went on to set up his own business and was elected as a Conservative councillor in Surrey on Woking Borough Council, for the Brookwood ward, in May 2000. He did not defend his seat at the end of his term in 2004.\n\nPritchard unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Warley in the West Midlands for the Conservative Party in the 2001 general election where he was defeated by John Spellar of the Labour party.\n\nPritchard was first elected to parliament for The Wrekin constituency in 2005, defeating Peter Bradley, the incumbent Labour MP, by just 942 votes although this represented a 5.4% swing from Labour to Conservative. He was one of 130 candidates who received help from 20,000 countryside campaigners from the Countryside Party who \"poured into marginal seats all over Britain\" in an attempt to unseat anti-hunting Labour MPs. During the campaign pro-hunt supporters \"delivered 3.4 million leaflets, addressed 2.1 million envelopes, put up 55,000 posters and provided 170,000 hours of campaigning.\" Pritchard was also one of 30 Conservative MPs who benefited from large \"below the radar\" donations paid to candidates from a secret Conservative Party donors' fund set up by Lord Ashcroft, Lord Steinberg and the Midlands Industrial Council.\n\nAfter retaining his seat at the 2010 general election, he was joint secretary of the 1922 Committee between 2010–2012.\n\nPritchard was at the centre of a political story in 2010 when he had a public confrontation with John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, who had told him to stand aside in a corridor. Pritchard then told him, \"You are not fucking royalty, Mr Speaker!\"\n\nPritchard was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron as a member of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy 2010–2015. He was appointed by Foreign Secretary, William Hague to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly 2005–2010. He was a Member of the House of Commons Joint Committee on Human Rights 2015–2017.\n\nHe is a graduate of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme (Army). He has visited Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nPritchard was appointed to the post of deputy chairman of the Conservative Party's International Office in 2010 but resigned in January 2012 over policy differences on: \"a lack of national and individual aspiration, immigration, and Europe\" - what some commentators called \"the Holy Trinity of the Conservative right\".\n\nHe is the vice-chairman of the Conservative Parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. He formerly served as 'backbench support' to William Hague and to Dr Liam Fox, the former Defence Secretary, whilst in opposition. UK newspapers reported that Pritchard was to be offered the position of Parliamentary Private Secretary to Dr Fox, but the appointment was vetoed by David Cameron. Pritchard was one of the most vocal supporters of Cameron's leadership rival, David Davis MP.\n\nIn November 2013, Pritchard was subject to a series of articles in \"The Daily Telegraph \"regarding revelations from undercover investigations that he had offered to use his political contacts to set up business deals with foreign officials and ministers in return for being paid hundreds of thousands of pounds. Following the revelations Pritchard referred himself to the Standards Commissioner. Kathryn Hudson, the Standards Commissioner, subsequently announced that she would not investigate Pritchard, because there was \"insufficient evidence\", although the \"Daily Telegraph\" protested that the Commissioner has failed to contact the newspaper for its evidence. Pritchard maintained that he had not broken the Code of Conduct and that his business contacts were unconnected to his parliamentary work.\n\nIn December 2014, he was arrested and later bailed over an allegation of rape. On 6 January 2015, the police inquiry was dropped on the basis that there was insufficient evidence for a case to proceed. Pritchard urged a review of the law on anonymity for people accused of rape, saying that it was unfair that he was publicly identified whilst his accuser remained anonymous.\n\nHe was appointed by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond as a member of the British delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a 47-nation body - separate to the EU - which upholds human rights, democracy and the rule of law, from 2014–17.\n\nIn January 2017, it was reported that an inquiry had been launched into all-party parliamentary groups amid concerns they were being used to bypass lobbying rules. Pritchard was singled out in reports as the parliamentarian who sits on the most APPGs, with membership of 41 separate groups.\n\nIn December 2017, UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, appointed him to be the Leader of the UK's delegation to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Also in 2017, he was appointed as the UK's first Trade Envoy to Georgia and Armenia working with the Department for International Trade.\n\nIn the House of Commons he sits on the Panel of Chairs. Pritchard has served on several select committees: Transport, Works & Pensions, Wales, and Environmental Audit. He is chairman or vice-chairman of several all-party parliamentary groups, including the ASEAN region, and Africa. Pritchard is also an executive member of the British Parliamentary Group. In 2015, Pritchard succeeded Michael Connarty MP as the joint-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Jazz Appreciation Group \n\nAlthough a eurosceptic, Pritchard supported the official position of his party and campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union before the EU membership referendum on 23 June 2016. Since the result was announced, Pritchard has continued to support the party leadership and now advocates leaving the European Union. He has never rebelled against the Government in the current Parliament.\n\nIn March 2018, he was one of three MPs accused of using threatening and intimidating behaviour towards parliamentary clerks. An investigation by the BBC claimed Pritchard used foul language in an exchange with a clerk and was known for having a bad temper. He responded that \"there was no truth in the claims whatsoever\", saying that he never used foul language and had never had a complaint levelled against him.\n\nPritchard previously employed his wife as his Office Manager on a salary up to £45,000. The practice of MPs employing family members has been criticised by some sections of the media on the lines that it promotes nepotism.\n\nHe is Director of Mark Pritchard Advisory Ltd, a consultancy, from which he earns an annual income of over £65,000. Additional employment for MPs as consultants has been criticised and his Labour Party opponents have called for the practice to be outlawed, but it is currently legal.\n\nRegarded as right of centre, Pritchard nonetheless was one of the first advocates of compassionate conservatism in the United Kingdom and has vocally supported the coalition government's policy of increased spending on international aid. He believes in tougher sentences for criminals – but has also supported the coalition government's efforts to increase the number of treatment and rehabilitation centres. He is on record as saying he would not support the restoration of the death penalty and has served as the Joint Chairman of the All Party Group for the Abolition of the Death Penalty since 2012. His main political contributions focus on defence, foreign affairs, counter-terrorism, home affairs, anti-abortion and animal welfare issues.\n\nPritchard is not in favour of gay marriage, having voted against this on several occasions.\n\nPritchard is known for his advocacy of animal welfare issues and introduced three animal welfare related private Ten Minute Rule Bills in the period 2006–09. These were the Sale of Endangered Animals on the Internet (Prohibition) Bill, 2006; Primates As Pets (Prohibition) Bill, 2007 and the Common Birds (Protection) Bill, 2009.\n\nIn June 2011 he successfully moved a motion to ban wild animals in circuses. In the House of Commons he stated that he had been placed under pressure by the prime minister to withdraw the motion, first by being offered a job, and then by being threatened. Pritchard has been nominated for numerous animal welfare awards including the Dods Charity Champion Award for Animal Welfare.\n\nPritchard is a Eurosceptic, defining himself as a \"mainstream Eurosceptic\". He was one of the \"Tory Rebels\" who oversaw the largest post-war defeat of any Conservative government concerning a European Referendum. In 2011, he called for an \"in/out referendum\" on the European Union. Central to Pritchard's argument was that \"The majority of Britons living today have never had a say on Europe\". Pritchard referred to this group as \"the great disenfranchised\".\n\nPritchard supported the motion calling for a \"real terms cut\" in the EU's multi-annual budget in 2012. He was joined by fellow Eurosceptic MP, Mark Reckless, to draft the so-called 'Reckless-Pritchard amendment' which saw David Cameron's government defeated over the issue. Reckless later defected to Ukip. Pritchard said that the vote would \"strengthen David Cameron's hand in Brussels\".\n\nPritchard has also been outspoken on immigration issues, being one of the co-signatories of an amendment calling for the extension UK border controls for Romanians and Bulgarians beyond 1 January 2014. He also held a debate on the issue in April 2013.\n\nOn 31 January 2016, Pritchard declared himself a \"reluctant inner\", supporting Britain's membership of the EU. In the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the EU Pritchard campaigned for a Remain vote. He set out a number of security and foreign policy concerns in an article in \"The Sunday Times\".\n\nPritchard is registered as the vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary Pro-Life Group. He was the mover of an amendment to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 in the 2005–2010 parliament, which sought to reduce the term-limit for abortions from 24 weeks to 16 weeks.\n\nIn July 2013, Mark Pritchard announced that he was divorcing his wife of 15 years, Sondra, following their separation in April 2013.\n\nPritchard has several business interests outside of politics, with commitments to some 55 hours of non-parliamentary duties each month.\n\n"}

Situated at the end of \"Rua de Santa Justa\", it connects the lower streets of the \"Baixa\" with the higher \"Largo do Carmo\" (Carmo Square).\n\nSince its construction the Lift has become a tourist attraction for Lisbon as, among the urban lifts in the city, Santa Justa is the only remaining vertical (conventional) one. Others, including \"Elevador da Glória\" and \"Elevador da Bica\", are actually funicular railways, and the other lift constructed around the same time, the Elevator of São Julião, has since been demolished.\n\nThe hills of Lisbon have always presented a problem for travel between the lower streets of the main \"Baixa\" and the higher \"Largo do Carmo\" (Carmo Square)., In order to facilitate the movement between the two, the civil and military engineer Roberto Arménio presented a project to the Lisbon municipal council in 1874. A similar project was suggested in 1876, that included rail-lines that would be pulled by animals up an inclined plane. \n\nIn May 1882 founder and representative of the \"Companhia dos Ascensores Mecânicos de Lisboa\", Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, petitioned the city council for permission to explore alternative plans for constructing an inclined transport moved by mechanical means. On 1 June 1882, Mesnier, a Porto-born engineer of French parentage, was granted a licence to proceed.\n\nIn 1896 Mesnier petitioned for the concession of this project, in order to establish the \"Escadinhas de Santa Justa\", a request that was contested by Henry Lusseau. At the same time, the \"Serviços de Obras da Câmara\" (\"Municipal Public Services\") supported Mesnier's petition, and the concession to authorize the construction and exploration of the Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard Elevator was approved. It took two years to receive a provisional license to construct the structure. In 1899, the \"Empresa do Elevador do Carmo\" (\"Company of the Elevator of Carmo\") was founded (constituted by principal partners Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, medical surgeon João Silvestre de Almeida and the Marquess of Praia e Monforte, António Borges de Medeiros Dias da Câmara e Sousa) in order to secure the permanent concession of the elevator project for a period of 99 years.\n\nIn 1900, the formal contract was signed between the Municipal Council of Lisbon and the \"Empresa do Elevador do Carmo\" (extinct in 1939), on which the working group was obligated to present a project for an elevator in a period of six months; planning on the construction had already begun with the Lisbon branch of the metal constructors Cardoso D'Argent & Cia. (founded in 1897), on Rua Da Junqueira. The founder, Manuel Cardoso, had already been placed in charge of the offices of firm \"Empresa Industrial Portuguesa\" and was responsible for the workers in the Elevador de Santa Justa project. By the middle of the year, the land that would be the main site was already in movement, establishing the footings and equipment house (2 June of the same year).\n\nOn 31 August 1901, King Carlos inaugurated the metal bridge and awning, in a ceremony that included members of the royal family, the members of the elevator company, Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, and various members of the nobility and journalists. Its initial operation was delayed: the operating car was only inaugurated in 1902 in the presence of the managing director of the concessionary company, Dr. Silvestre de Almeida, accompanied by journalists and other invited guests, in a ceremony presided over by the Secretary-General of the Civil Government.\n\nThe operating concession was given to the company Lisbon Electric Tramway Ltd. in 1905. Originally powered by steam, the lift was converted to electrical operation in 1907 by the British company R. Waygood, and the respective concessionary company bought the Elevator in 1913, from the \"Empresa do Elevador do Carmo\".\n\nIn 1943, the Lisbon Electric Tramway Ltd. solicited the city council to authorize the transfer of the elevator to the \"Companhia da Carris\". The process was approved, with the condition that its operation should be integrated into the transport network, with the \"Companhia da Carris\" as the principal.\n\nBy 1973, a contract was signed between the municipal council of Lisbon, the Companhia da Carris and the Lisbon Electric Tramway Ltd., transferring the Elevator definitively into the city's historical tram network.\n\nIn July 2002, the Santa Justa Elevator celebrated its first centenary; along with the three remaining cable railways of Lavra, Glória and Bica, they were all classified as National Monuments in the same year.\n\nAfter remodelling and renovation, the elevator walkway was reopened in February 2006 for the general public and tourists.\n\nThe lift is included on the historical guides of Lisbon, within the down-town \"Pombaline Baixa\" area between several older historical buildings in the quarter. It is situated in the \"Escadinhas de Santa Justa\" which connects the \"Baixa\" to the \"Rua do Carmo\". The \"Escadinhas\" are actually part of the north-eastern urban wall of the \"Baixa\" and west of the \"Rua de Santa de Justa.\" The elevator gives access to many of the important zones of the city. To the north, towards the Rossio (\"Praça D. Pedro IV\" and \"Avenida da Liberdade\"); to the south, the (\"Terreiro do Paço\") Praça do Comércio and the river zone; while in the upper zone, there is access to the \"Largo do Carmo\", the \"Trindade\", Church of São Roque and the Bairro Alto quarter. In addition, the panoramic views allow glimpses of the Castle of São Jorge, the Tagus River, the lower part of the \"Baixa\", the National Theatre D. Maria II, while the upper entrance permits a view of the ruins of the Monastery of Nossa Senhora do Vencimento do Monte do Carmo.\n\nThe elevator is a vertical structure, developed along the \"Rua de Santa Justa\", consisting of a metal tower, observation platform, walkway and base. Its base includes four vertical columns, each composed of two pillars. The largest part of the structure runs parallel to the \"Rua de Santa Justa\". With a height of 45 metres, covering seven stories, the tower includes two elevator cabins, decorated in wood, mirrors and windows, and with an initial capacity for 24 passengers in each (updated to 29 people later). The structure includes a dozen transverse beams, forming a double lattice, supported at the top by foundations at the \"Escadinhas de Santa Justa.\" On the sides of the elevator, the walkway is articulated by means of bearings, as well as on the pillars, which is articulated at the base.\n\nThe top floor is a lookout, with panoramic views of the city, while connections to the floors below are made (in addition to the elevator) by two spiral staircases, with different patterns on each storey. The main machinery was installed at the base of the Elevator, while at the exit to the \"Largo do Carmo\" there is a veranda to allow circulation. The corridor that passes above the structure, was transformed into a terrace, and exits to \"Largo do Carmo\" through an iron gate. The space destined the electrical equipment was located under the \"Escadinhas\", in a space set aside for this purpose, under a vaulted ceiling.\n\nThe lift is decorated in a Neo-Gothic style in iron. Since iron was a new building material at the time of its construction, it is symbolic of the technical and memorial construction from this period, representing the culture of the 1900s, when the structure and elevators were considered a major innovation and portent of a modern age.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873766", "title": "Ryan Field (stadium)", "text": "Ryan Field (stadium)\n\nRyan Field is a stadium in Evanston, Illinois, a suburb north of Chicago. Near the campus of Northwestern University, it is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Northwestern Wildcats of the Big Ten Conference. It is the only FBS stadium without permanent lighting. Its current seating capacity is 49,256.\n\nOpened in 1926, it was named Dyche Stadium for William Dyche, class of 1882, a former Evanston mayor and overseer of the building project. The stadium was renamed Ryan Field in 1997 in honor of the family of Aon Corporation founder Patrick G. Ryan, who was then the chairman of Northwestern's board of trustees. The renaming was made by the other members of the board in recognition of the Ryan family's leadership and numerous contributions to Northwestern, including the lead gift to the Campaign for Athletic Excellence, Northwestern's fundraising drive for athletic facilities.\n\nAt the time it was constructed, Dyche Stadium was considered one of the finest college football stadiums in the country. The stadium originally consisted of two semi circular grandstands on either sideline, with the west (home) sideline having a small, curved upper deck whose 2 ends abut in matching concrete towers. The purpose of the curved grandstands was to maximize the number of fans sitting close to the action. End zone seating was later added in the south, and in 1952 McGaw Memorial Hall was built beyond the north end zone.\n\nThe stadium had a natural grass surface when it opened. It switched to artificial turf in 1973 and was used until 1996. Prior to the 1997 season, the natural grass surface was restored and the playing surface was lowered approximately to improve sight lines from the lowest rows of the stadium. As of 2017, Ryan Field is the only stadium in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) without permanent lights.\n\nThe Chicago Bears played their first home game of the 1970 season at Dyche Stadium on September 28 as an experiment; the NFL had required that the Bears move out of Wrigley Field because its seating capacity was under 50,000, which was below the minimum set out by the newly constituted post-merger NFL. Also, the Chicago Cubs were in a September pennant race with the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets in the National League East. If Wrigley Field was needed for postseason baseball games, the temporary grandstand for football along the east sideline (in right and center field) would not be available until late October. After Evanston residents petitioned city officials to block the team from moving there permanently, the Bears ended up moving to Chicago's Soldier Field the following year.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 1932 Women's (July 16) and 1948 Men's (July 9–10) US Olympic Trials for track and field. The venue also hosted the NCAA track and field championships in 1943.\n\nIt also hosted the summer College All-Star Game in 1943 and 1944, which had usually been instead held at Chicago's Soldier Field. Both games were played at night with the use of temporary lights. The college all-stars held their practices for the game at Ryan Field in years such as 1934 and 1935.\nNorthwestern's decision to rename Dyche Stadium to Ryan Field defied the university's own 1926 resolution that forbade such a change. School officials said that a private institution can override previous boards' decisions, and dismissed the earlier resolution as a \"show of appreciation.\" But NU did not explain why a mere gesture of appreciation would expressly state that any football stadium at any location would retain the name Dyche, as indeed the 1926 resolution does. The Dyche family wasn't notified of the change; NU claimed that the only descendant they found was a grandniece, despite other family members living in Chicago and being listed in the phone book. After the family protested, NU said it was willing to install an informational plaque at the stadium, noting its former name.\n\nThe closest transit stations are Metra commuter railroad's Central Street station and Chicago Transit Authority's Central station on the Purple Line.\n\nParts of \"\", a 2008 film about Syracuse University Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis starring Rob Brown as Davis, and Dennis Quaid as Davis' Syracuse coach, Ben Schwartzwalder, were filmed at Ryan Field.\n\nParts of \"Four Friends\", a 1981 film directed by Arthur Penn, were filmed at Dyche Stadium.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for football, and is the home field of the Michigan State University Spartans. After the addition of luxury boxes and club seating in 2004–2005, the capacity of the stadium grew from 72,027 to 75,005—though it has held more than 80,000 fans—making it the Big Ten's sixth largest stadium.\n\nIn the early 1920s, school officials decided to construct a new stadium to replace Old College Field. The resulting stadium—the lower half of the current stadium—was ready in the fall of 1923 with a capacity of 14,000. Over the years, the stadium grew. In 1935, the seating capacity increased to 26,000 and the facility was dedicated as Macklin Field. It was named in honor of former coach John Macklin, who put Michigan State football on the map with a 29–5 record from 1911 to 1915 with victories over big name programs such as Michigan, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Penn State, and Wisconsin. After admittance into the Big Ten in 1948, Michigan State increased stadium capacity to 51,000 and the field was renamed Macklin Stadium. With Spartan football attracting national attention under Clarence \"Biggie\" Munn and Hugh \"Duffy\" Daugherty, 9,000 seats were added in 1956. The following season, the east and west sides were double-decked, boosting the capacity to 76,000. That same season, the stadium received its current name, Spartan Stadium. The school installed permanent lights in 2017.\n\nIn 1969, TartanTurf replaced the natural grass field and a modern scoreboard was added in 1973. In 1978, AstroTurf replaced the TartanTurf. A new modern video scoreboard was added before the 1991 season. Renovations improving sight lines, field security, handicap access, and club seats in 1994 reduced Spartan Stadium's capacity to 72,027. New turf was also installed in the summer of 1994. In 1998, Spartan Stadium's sound system was upgraded, adding a 21' x 27' Mitsubishi Diamond Vision video board to the south end and a message board to the north end. Home to one of the top turfgrass research programs in the nation, Michigan State installed a natural grass field in 2002. The most recent expansion was completed in August 2005. A new press box, 24 luxury suites, and 862 club seats were constructed on the west side of Spartan Stadium. This addition made Spartan Stadium the tallest building in East Lansing.\n\nThrough the 2012 season until their game against Notre Dame, the Spartans had won 15 straight games in Spartan Stadium—the program's longest home streak since winning 19 straight from 1950-53. Michigan State went undefeated at home in back-to-back seasons (2010 and 2011) including marquee wins over Wisconsin, Michigan, and Notre Dame, marking the first consecutive perfect home seasons since 1955-56.\n\nFor almost nine years, the stadium held the world record for the largest ice hockey crowd in history. On October 6, 2001, a rink was constructed at the center of the stadium for Michigan State's season-opening game against archrival Michigan. Dubbed \"The Cold War\", 74,554 watched No. 1 nationally ranked Michigan State and No. 4 nationally ranked Michigan to a 3–3 tie. Country artist Shannon Brown sang during the second intermission. The game set off a wave of outdoor ice hockey games in large stadiums.\nOn September 3, 2005, Spartan Stadium unveiled an 8-story, expansion which had been under construction since 2003.

Segrest is best known for her 1994 autobiographical work \"Memoir of a Race Traitor,\" which won the Editor's Choice Lambda Literary Award.\nIn the 1970s, Segrest moved to North Carolina to attend Duke University, where she earned her PhD in English literature in 1979. While studying at Duke, and for several years thereafter, she taught English at nearby Campbell University. Segrest worked at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut since 2002 and in 2004 was appointed the Fuller-Matthai Professor of Gender and Women's Studies. She retired from teaching in 2014.\n\nSegrest has founded, served on the boards of, and consulted with a wide range of social justice organizations throughout her life and is a recognized speaker and writier on issues of sexism, racism, homophobia, classism, and other forms of oppression. From 1983 to 1990, Segrest worked with North Carolinians Against Racist and Religious Violence (NCARRV)., for which she is credited by many for ridding North Carolina of the Ku Klux Klan. From 1992 to 2000 she served as coordinator of the Urban-Rural Mission (USA), part of the URM network of the World Council of Churches.\n\nUntil it disbanded in 1983, Segrest was a member of the Southern feminist writing collective Feminary, which also produced a journal of the same name. Feminarians, including Segrest, saw writing as a force for political change, and the journal maintained a Southern feminist focus and was anti-sexist, anti-racist, anti-homophobic, and anti-classist.\n\nThrough the collective and other activist work, Segrest generated material for her first book of essays, \"My Mama's Dead Squirrel\".\n\nHer book narrating her experience working against the Klan with North Carolinians Against Racist and Religious Violence (NCARRV) is \"Memoir of a Race Traitor\", published in 1994. It was named an Outstanding Book on Human Rights in North America and was Editor's Choice for the Lambda Literary Awards. \"Memoir of a Race Traitor\" has been hailed by Howard Zinn as \"extraordinary . . . It is a 'political memoir,' but its language is poetic and its tone passionate.\" It is considered a key text in white studies and anti-racist studies. In this work, Segrest outlines her definition of \"queer socialism,\" which is how she defines her political stance. This version of socialism demands a more caring world where all citizens are taken into consideration when resources are allocated and opportunities are dispensed. She says that while there is no blueprint as yet for this form of socialism, it would be based in feminist theory and practice. It was re-released in 2019 by The New Press.\n\nSegrest's book, \"Born to Belonging: Writings on Spirit and Justice\" was published in 2002 and recounts her experiences in activism around the world. Segrest co-edited \"Sing, Whisper, Shout, Pray: Feminist Strategies for a Just World\" (2003) with Jacqui Alexander, Lisa Albrect and Sharon Day.\n\nSegres was awarded a fellowship at the National Humanities Center to support the writing of her \"Administrations of Lunacy: Racism and the Haunting of American Psychiatry at the Milledgeville Asylum\" on the history of the Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, Georgia, forthcoming in 2020 by The New Press.\n\nFounding Riot grrrl band Le Tigre mention Segrest's name in their 1999 single \"Hot Topic,\" from their debut album Le Tigre.

It is the home stadium of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes, in the sport of college football. First opened in 1929 to replace Iowa Field, it currently holds up to 69,250 people, making it the 7th largest stadium in the Big Ten, and one of the 20 largest university owned stadiums in the nation. It is named for Nile Kinnick, the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner and the only Heisman winner in university history, who died in service during World War II. It was named Iowa Stadium until 1972, when longtime lobbying by \"Cedar Rapids Gazette\" sportswriter Gus Schrader successfully convinced the UI athletic board to change the name. It is currently the only college football stadium named after a Heisman Trophy winner.\n\nIowa Stadium was constructed in only seven months between 1928 and 1929. Groundbreaking and construction began on March 6, 1929. Workers worked around the clock using lights by night and horses and mules as the primary heavy-equipment movers. There was a rumor for many years that horses that died during the process were buried under what now is the North end zone. Historians report this is a myth and the animals were disposed of in the nearby Iowa River. The round-the-clock construction came to an end in July. Despite several problems to overcome, including the athletic director's resignation and a slight redesign, the stadium was completed and the first game was played October 5, 1929, against Monmouth College. Iowa won the game 46–0. The stadium was dedicated two weeks later, when the Hawkeyes tied Illinois 7–7.\n\nThe playing surface is currently the synthetic FieldTurf (installed in 2009), although it was AstroTurf from 1972 until grass was reinstalled for the 1989 season. The installation of artificial turf came at the same time that Iowa Stadium was renamed Kinnick Stadium in honor of the Heisman winner who had perished 29 years earlier.\n\nWhen filled to capacity, Kinnick Stadium would be the sixth largest city in Iowa (after Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Sioux City, and Iowa City).\n\nPrior to the 2015 football season, the stadium did not have permanent lights; the school contracted Musco Lighting's portable light trucks for night games in previous years. The school had installed permanent practice lights at the stadium in 2012.\n\nBy capacity, Kinnick Stadium is the 27th largest college football stadium, the 42nd largest sports stadium in the United States, and the 86th largest sports stadium in the world. On November 14, 2015, Iowa set the national collegiate wrestling dual-meet attendance record at Kinnick with over 42,000 fans in a victory over #1 Oklahoma State.\n\nKinnick Stadium is well known for its pink visitors' locker rooms, a tradition started by emeritus Iowa coach Hayden Fry. Believing that pink would put opponents in a \"passive mood\", and because he thought that some believed pink was a \"sissy color\", Fry had the visiting locker rooms decorated completely in the color pink.\n\nThe pink locker room tradition has been continued with the newly renovated locker rooms, which include everything from pink urinals to pink lockers. Controversy flared during the 2005 season when a visiting law professor, along with other university faculty and students protested the pink coloration as demeaning to women and homosexuals. Despite these protests and with lots of student support, however, the locker room remains pink.\nA more recent feature is the bronze statue of Heisman Trophy winner Nile Kinnick, the statue depicts Kinnick dressed as a scholar, rather than in his football uniform. The bronze statue is placed near the team entrance to the stadium. When the renovation of the stadium was completed, and the statue unveiled, a tradition among the players began: one player, before entering the locker room, reached out and touched the helmet that was placed at Kinnick's feet. From that point on, all Iowa players, before entering the locker room, and after getting off the bus, walk up to the statue and rub the helmet, as a token of respect for Kinnick - the only Iowa player to ever win the Heisman Trophy.\nThe on-field entrances to the stadium all have one thing in common, a picture of Nile Kinnick is placed above the tunnel before exiting the tunnel to the field.\n\n After 75 years of operation, the Iowa Board of Regents endorsed a major renovation of Kinnick Stadium on March 10, 2004. The US$86.8 million project was to build a new state of the art press box, a new scoreboard with a new sound system, replace the \"temporary\" south endzone bleachers with permanent seating, triple the restroom facilities, and more than double the number of concession stands, as well as smaller changes such as new locker rooms, a bronze statue of Nile Kinnick and the dedication of the Krause Family Plaza to which Kinnick Stadium is now adjacent. Every brick for the renovation came from the Glen-Gery Brickyard in Redfield, which is located near Nile Kinnick's childhood home in Adel. The stadium was rededicated on September 1, 2006. Among other things, the rededication featured a flyover by a F4F Wildcat, the aircraft that Kinnick flew in World War II.\n\nThe stadium also underwent major renovations in 1956, 1983, and 1990 where capacity was gradually taken from 53,000 to 70,397.

These upgrades include the installation of new HD video displays in both the north and south endzones, as well as a new HD ribbon display above the north endzone. The upgrades were completed by the start of the 2013 football season.\n\nIn 2016, the Iowa Board of Regents approved an $89.9 million upgrade to Kinnick Stadium's north end zone. The renovation included the addition of box seating, outdoor club seating and a scoreboard larger than the board in the south end zone. These renovations lowered the total capacity of the stadium to 69,250. The project was completed shortly before the beginning of the 2019 season.\n\nIn 2019, the tunnel connecting the home locker room to the field was upgraded, with the addition of black and gold signage, lighting, and logos.\n\nThe University of Iowa Children's Hospital's new building overlooks the East stands of Kinnick Stadium. The opening of the new hospital in 2017 led to the creation of what ESPN called \"college football's coolest new tradition.\"\n\nThe new facility includes a top-floor lounge area known as the Press Box Cafe that has a view of the entire field, allowing patients and their families to see all Iowa home games live, and also includes big-screen TVs to allow them to watch Hawkeyes road games. A suggestion on a Hawkeyes fan page on Facebook led to \"The Wave\"—at the end of the first quarter of Iowa home games, the crowd faces the hospital and waves at the patients and their families watching in the Press Box. For the Hawkeyes' first night home game of the 2017 season against Penn State, the fan site where the idea of \"The Wave\" originated encouraged fans to turn on their cell phone flashlights while they waved to the patients. Ever since the humble beginnings of the “Kinnick Wave”, even players on both teams and the on-field game officials join in this heartwarming tradition now.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily used for football, and is the home field of the Indiana Hoosiers. The stadium opened in 1960 as part of a new athletics area at the university and currently has a capacity of 52,626. It replaced the original Memorial Stadium, built in 1925, a 20,000-seat stadium located on 10th Street where the arboretum now stands.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated or updated multiple times since the original construction, including the replacement of the original wooden seats with aluminum bleachers, installation of sound and lighting systems, and major structural overhauls.\n\nOn June 1, 2003, a $3.5 million renovation of the Memorial Stadium press box was completed, which also added 300 indoor club seats and 9 suites. In the summer of 2003, the Hoosier locker room in Memorial Stadium underwent a $250,000 renovation. The facelift to the original 1986 facility included renovating and modernizing the existing space with new carpeting, lighting, and a new bulkhead ceiling along with the installation of custom-built oak wood lockers for 105 football players. The renovation was funded in large part by former Hoosier quarterback Trent Green his wife Julie and philanthropist Ted Derheimer. In 2019, the $8.5 million Terry Tallen Indiana Football Complex opened, after J.C. Ripberger Construction Corp was able to finish the project in only 6 months, including an expanded and renovated locker room area, training room and sports lounge, to allow players to get acquainted with video games on 98\" televisions.\n\nA 36 x HD scoreboard from Daktronics was added to the South End Zone for the 2010 season (which is the 29th largest collegiate scoreboard in the country), along with a state-of-the-art sound system.\n\nThe field at the stadium was originally natural grass, but this was replaced in 1970 with artificial turf, which was updated to AstroTurf in 1986. The AstroTurf was replaced with grass in 1998, but the field soon reverted to an artificial surface (AstroPlay) in 2003. Heavy rains in June 2008 severely damaged the field, washing away the gravel substrate, and creating a large sinkhole in the south end zone, which led to the installation of a FieldTurf surface. A new FieldTurf Revolution 360 playing surface was installed prior to the 2016 season.\n\nIn 2005, head football coach Terry Hoeppner had a southern Indiana limestone boulder, nicknamed \"The Rock\", installed in the north end zone as a new campus tradition. This limestone boulder was found prior to Hoeppner's first season at IU in the practice field. It was removed, put on a granite slab and moved to the stadium. The Hoosiers and coach Hoeppner walked out and touched the Rock before running onto the field at every home game during Hoeppner's time as head coach (a tradition that continues today). Terry Hoeppner died of brain cancer on June 19, 2007, and The Rock (renamed \"Hep's Rock\" during a ceremony with the Hoeppner family on November 6, 2010) now serves as motivation for the team as well as a tribute to Hoeppner's influence on the football program.\n\nThe prow, mainmast, and two guns of the USS Indiana (BB-58) are erected at the western entrance of the stadium. The battleship saw extensive service in the Pacific Theater during World War II, taking part in the invasion of the Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, Marianas campaign, and the Battle of Iwo Jima and earning nine battle stars.\n\nIn September 2006, Indiana University announced plans to expand Memorial Stadium and enclose the north end zone. Demolition of the North End Zone bleachers took place in January 2007. This left capacity for the 2007 and 2008 seasons at 49,225.\n\nThe expansion provides additional space for classrooms, a weight/training room, a Hall of Fame, and expanded seating for football, raising the stadium's seating capacity to 52,692. The expansion is part of an overall $55 million expansion of several Indiana University athletic facilities. The project was completed as scheduled in August 2009, and was ready for the Hoosiers when they opened against Eastern Kentucky on September 3, 2009.\n\nIndiana Athletic Director Fred Glass announced in July 2009 $3 million of additional renovations to the stadium for the 2009 season, including a new \"retro\" North End Zone scoreboard, a \"Knothole Park\" kids area in the south end zone, upgrades to the press box, repainting walkways, renovated concession stands, additional ticket booths, and new fencing around the stadium.\n\nIndiana University Athletic Director Fred Glass said on October 9, 2014 that a project to enclose the south end of Memorial Stadium is being planned at an estimated cost of $10 million. The project will include: a new rehabilitation and treatment facility for athletes, additional academic and life skills support facilities, a \"multi-use\" outdoor terrace on the roof of the structure, an entry plaza and green space at the south end of the stadium. The project was confirmed in March 2016, and is expected to be completed for the 2018 season. The total cost is $53 million. A new video board was installed in the North End Zone for the 2017 season, with a video board installed prior to the 2018 season, in the completed south end zone.\n\n"}

It is named in honor of Purdue alumni David E. Ross and George Ade, the principal benefactors. In 1922 Ade and Ross bought of land for the site of the new stadium. They also provided additional financial support for construction of the facility. Ross–Ade Stadium opened on November 22, 1924, with a seating capacity of 13,500--roughly corresponding to the lower portion of the current facility's west grandstand---and standing room for an additional 5,000 people. A series of additions and renovations pushed the seating capacity to almost 68,000 (70,000 with standing room).

{"id": "1873861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873861", "title": "Claude Montefiore", "text": "Claude Montefiore\n\nClaude Joseph Goldsmid Montefiore, also Goldsmid–Montefiore or just Goldsmid Montefiore  (1858–1938) was the intellectual founder of Anglo-Liberal Judaism and the founding president of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, a scholar of the Hebrew Bible, rabbinic literature and New Testament. He was a significant figure in the contexts of modern Jewish religious thought, Jewish-Christian relations, and Anglo-Jewish socio-politics, and educator. Montefiore was President of the Anglo-Jewish Association and an influential anti-Zionist leader, who co-founded the anti-Zionist League of British Jews in 1917.\n\nClaude Montefiore was the youngest son of Nathaniel Montefiore and Emma Goldsmid. He had two sisters, Alice Julia and Charlotte Rosalind and one brother, Leonard (1853-1879). He was the great-nephew of Sir Moses Montefiore. \n\nMontefiore's first wife was Therese Alice Schorstein, who had been a student at Girton College. She died in 1889 and, two years later, he endowed a prize in her memory – the Therese Montefiore Memorial Prize. Their son was Leonard G. Montefiore. Montefiore remarried at the West London Synagogue on 24 July 1902. His second wife was Florence Fyfe Brereton Ward, daughter of Richard James Ward, and a Vice-Mistress at Girton, having started there as Librarian.\n\nPart of Montefiore's childhood was spent at his family's Coldeast estate in Sarisbury Green, Hampshire.\n\nHe was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class honours degree in the classical final examination, and where he came under the influence of Benjamin Jowett and T. H. Green. Intended originally for the ministry of the West London Synagogue, he studied theology in Berlin, but finding himself unable to sympathise with the arrest of the Reform Movement, he devoted himself instead to scholarly and philanthropic pursuits. He nevertheless continued to be a spiritual teacher and preacher, though in a lay capacity, and published a volume of sermons, in conjunction with Israel Abrahams, entitled \"Aspects of Judaism\" (London, 1894). In 1886, he was selected by the Hibbert Trustees to deliver their course of lectures for 1892 (\"The Origin of Religion as Illustrated by the Ancient Hebrews\"). In these lectures, Montefiore made a permanent contribution to the science of theology. In 1896, he published the first volume of his \"Bible for Home Reading,\" forming a commentary on the Bible with moral reflections from the standpoint of the \"higher criticism\"; the second volume appeared in 1899. In 1888 Montefiore founded and edited, in conjunction with Israel Abrahams, the \"Jewish Quarterly Review\", a journal that stood on the very highest level of contemporary Jewish scholarship, and in which numerous contributions from his pen have appeared.\n\nAmong Jewish religious leaders, Montefiore was unusual for the time and energy he devoted to the study of Christianity. He provoked considerable controversy for what was perceived by many to be an overly sympathetic attitude towards Jesus and Paul of Tarsus. Inter alia, he wrote a two-volume commentary on the \"Synoptic gospels\" in the early part of the twentieth century, \"What A Jew Thinks about Jesus\", published in 1935, and \"Judaism and St. Paul\" (1914).\n\nHe assisted Rev. Simeon Singer in preparing the standard Anglo-Jewish prayer book. This was acknowledged in the original preface, but his name was removed from the preface of the second edition.\n\nMontefiore was one of the leading authorities on questions of education. Montefiore was mainly instrumental in enabling Jewish pupil teachers at elementary schools to enjoy the advantages of training in classes held for the purpose at the universities.\n\nMontefiore showed great sympathy with all liberal tendencies in Jewish religious movements in London and was president of the Jewish Religious Union. He was president of the Jewish Historical Society of England in 1899–1900.\n\nHe ranked as one of the leading philanthropists in the Anglo-Jewish community and held office in various important bodies.\n\nAs a revered scholar, philanthropist and spiritual authority, Claude Montefiore belongs to that important group of learned laymen who have sought to revolutionise Judaism. He was a founder of British Liberal Judaism at the turn of the 20th Century, considered to be the most original Anglo-Jewish religious thinker of his day, and still remains a highly controversial figure. Montefiore infuriated his enemies and often alienated his supporters with his radical agenda in which he applied the findings of historical and literary analysis to the Jewish scriptures, attempted to radically systemise rabbinic thought, and by his desire to learn from and re-express aspects of Christian theology. The extent to which he incorporated the teachings of Jesus and Paul into his own ethical and theological musings makes him unique among Jewish reformers. In his dealings with Christians and Christian thought, he can also be regarded as a forerunner to those who would later fully partake in Jewish-Christian dialogue. Montefiore is an important figure in Anglo-Jewish history, not least for the way in which his complex identity reflects the difficulty inherent in attempting to make Judaism genuinely relevant to the modern world.\n\n\n\n"}

He had a brilliant privateering and naval career and eventually became \"Lieutenant-General of the Naval Armies of the King\" (i.e. Vice admiral) (French:\"Lieutenant-Général des armées navales du roi\"), and a Commander in the Order of Saint-Louis. Ten ships of the French Navy were named in his honour.\n\nHis family operated a shipping business in Saint Malo, a port favoured by corsairs.\n\nHe first went to sea as a volunteer aboard the privateer \"Trinité\", under Captain Legoux, on the 16 December 1690. \"Trinité\" subsequently captured \"François Samuel\" and \"Seven Stars of Scotland\". In 1692 his family provided him with command of his own vessel, a 14-gun lugger, \"Danycan.\"\n\nOn 6 June 1692, King Louis XIV appointed Duguay-Truin to command of the forty-gun ship \"Hercule\". He captured five ships at the entrance of the Channel.\n\nIn 1694 Louis XIV awarded Duguay-Trouin with a sword of honour, and made him a nobleman in 1709, with the motto \"Dedit haec insignia virtus\" (\"Bravery awarded these honours\"). At the time, he had captured 16 warships and over 300 merchantmen from the English and Dutch.\n\nOn 12 April 1694, Duguay-Trouin, aboard the ship \"Diligente\", covered the escape of a convoy which he was escorting but was defeated by a six-ship squadron commanded by Admiral David Mitchell. \"Diligente\", barely afloat and having lost most of her men, was forced to strike her colours and surrender and Duguay-Truin was taken as a prisoner to Plymouth.\n\nThe English admiralty, upon learning that Trouin had fired upon \"Prince of Orange\" while flying the English flag, had him locked in an iron room. On 19 June 1694, he made an adventurous escape, by capturing a small boat that he had bought from a friendly Swedish captain whose ship was lying nearby. He was accompanied by Lieutenant Nicolas Thomas, surgeon Lhermite, Pierre Legendre and the quartermaster. After a series of raids on coastal towns in Ireland, Duguay-Truin returned to Saint-Malo.\n\nIn 1697, the treaty of Ryswick put a halt to the privateers and Duguay-Trouin spent his time in Saint-Malo. He was involved in a duel with a gentleman, Charles Cognetz, who had allegedly cheated in a game of cards. Both were taken to the police officer, M de Vauborel, who explicitly forbade any further violence.\n\nIn 1702, as the War of the Spanish Succession broke out, Duguay-Trouin commanded \"Bellone\" and then \"Railleuse\". He became an officer in the French \"Marine Royale\". In 1704-1705 he commanded the ship \"Jason\" and captured the British ships of the line and .\n\nOn 21 October 1707, together with Claude de Forbin, he achieved his greatest victory against a British squadron, in the Battle at the Lizard.\n\nIn 1709 he captured the British ship of the line .\n\nOn 21 September 1711, in an 11-day battle, he captured Rio de Janeiro, then believed impregnable, with twelve ships and 6,000 men, in spite of the defence consisting of seven ships of the line, five forts, and 12,000 men; he held the governor for ransom. Investors in this venture doubled their money, and Duguay-Trouin earned a promotion to \"Lieutenant général de la Marine\".\n\nIn his late career, he commanded the fleet based in Saint-Malo, then the fleet based in Brest, the fleet for the East and eventually Toulon harbour. He died in 1736, after having written to Fleury to ask Louis XV to support his family.\n\nDuguay-Trouin is mentioned in Volume II, \"Within A Budding Grove\", of Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\" (previously published as \"Remembrance of Things Past\").

It commemorates Sir William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish hero.\nThe tower was constructed following a fundraising campaign, which accompanied a resurgence of Scottish national identity in the 19th century. In addition to public subscription, it was partially funded by contributions from a number of foreign donors, including Italian national leader Giuseppe Garibaldi. The foundation stone was laid in 1861 by the Duke of Atholl in his role as Grand Master Mason of Scotland with a short speech given by Sir Archibald Alison.\n\nIt was completed in 1869 to the designs of architect John Thomas Rochead at a cost of £18,000, the monument is a 67-metre (220 ft) sandstone tower, built in the Victorian Gothic style.\n\nThe tower stands on the Abbey Craig, a volcanic crag above Cambuskenneth Abbey, from which Wallace was said to have watched the gathering of the army of King Edward I of England, just before the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297. The monument is open to the general public. Visitors climb the 246 step spiral staircase to the viewing gallery inside the monument's crown, which provides expansive views of the Ochil Hills and the Forth Valley.\n\nA number of artifacts believed to have belonged to Wallace are on display inside the monument, including the Wallace Sword, a 1.63-metre (5 ft, 4 in) long sword weighing almost three kilograms. Inside is also a \"Hall of Heroes\", a series of busts of famous Scots, effectively a small national Hall of Fame. The heroes are Robert the Bruce, George Buchanan, John Knox, Allan Ramsay, Robert Burns, Robert Tannahill, Adam Smith, James Watt, Sir Walter Scott, William Murdoch, Sir David Brewster, Thomas Carlyle, Hugh Miller, Thomas Chalmers, David Livingstone, and W. E. Gladstone. In 2017 it was announced that Mary Slessor and Maggie Keswick Jencks will be the first heroines to be celebrated in the hall.\n\nThe original Victorian statue of Wallace stands on the corner of the monument and is by the Edinburgh sculptor David Watson Stevenson.\n\nIn 1996 Tom Church carved a statue of Wallace called \"Freedom\", which was inspired by the film \"Braveheart\". It has the face of Mel Gibson, the actor who played William Wallace in the film. Church leased the statue to Stirling Council, who in 1997 installed it in the car park of the visitor centre at the foot of the craig. The statue was deeply unpopular, being described as \"among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland\" \nand was regularly vandalised before being placed in a cage to prevent further damage. Plans to expand the visitor centre, including a new restaurant and reception, led to the unpopular statue's removal in 2008. It was returned to Church, who, after an unsuccessful attempt to sell it at auction, reportedly offered it to Donald Trump's Menie estate golf resort. However, it remained in the garden of the sculptor's home, where it was incorporated into a replica of a castle, and with additions to it that included the head of the decapitated governor of York. In April 2016, it was reported in local press that the statue might be moved to Ardrossan's old Barony Church.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873897", "title": "Ajiva", "text": "Ajiva\n\nAjiva (Sanskrit) is anything that has no soul or life, the polar opposite of \"jīva\" (soul). Because \"ajiva\" has no life, it does not accumulate \"karma\" and cannot die. Examples of ajiva include chairs, computers, paper, plastic, etc. According to Jain philosophy, \"Ajiva\" can be divided into two kinds, with form and without form.\n\nIn Jainism, there are five categories which \"ajīva\" can be placed into. Out of these, four categories, \"Dharma\" (medium of motion), \"Adharma\" (medium of rest), \"Akasha\" (space) and \"Pudgala\" (matter) are described as the \"asti-kaya dravya's\" (substances which possess constituent parts extending in space) while the fifth category \"Kala\" is an \"anasti-kaya dravya\" (which has no extension in space).\n\nDharmastikaya is formed from the two words: Dharma & Astikaya. Dharma here isn't referring to religion, but instead its referring to the medium of motion. Astikay itself is formed of two words: Asti & Kaya. Asti means space, body or mode and Kaya means collection. So Astikaya means a collection of spaces or regions. Dharmastikaya denotes the medium of motion for things in the universe. In the absence of this medium, living things (i.e. jiva) would not be able to move.\n\nAdharmastikaya is also formed from two words: Adharma & Astikaya. Adharma in this case means the\nmedium of rest. In the absence of this medium, Living things or jiva would continuously move.\n\nThe infinity of space, called \"ākāśa\" in Sanskrit, is divided by the Jain philosophy into two parts, namely, the \"lokākāśa\" (loka+ākāśa), that is the space occupied by the universe, and the \"alokākāśa\" (a not, and lokākāśa), the portion beyond the universe. The \"lokākāśa\" is the portion in which are to be found the remaining five substances, i.e., \"Jīvas\", Matter, Time, Dharma and Adharma; but the \"alokākāśa\" is the region of pure space containing no other substance and lying stretched on all sides beyond bounds of the three worlds (the entire universe). At the summit of the \"lokākāśa\" is the \"Siddhashila\" (abode of the liberated souls).\n\nThe word Pudgala is made up of two terms: \"Pud\" means supplement (integration) and \"Gala\" means disintegration (division). In other words, what continuously changes by supplementation and/or division (\"purayanti galanti cha\") is called Pudgala or matter. All matter in the universe is called Pudgala. Pudgala has form and shape. Pudgala can be experienced by touching, tasting, smelling, or seeing. Like Jiva Pudgala is also mobile. According to Jainism, The karma particles that attach to our souls are also Pudgala. Pudgala can only be divided and subdivided to a certain extent that it is not possible to further subdivide it. This indivisible part of Pudgala, which is separated from the main pudgala, is called Paramanu. A paramanu is much more minute than even an atom. When a Paramanu is attached to the main pudgala, it is called a Pradesha. These subatomic Paramanus are too minute to be detected by normal vision, but they can be combined. Thus when a paramanu is combined with one or more other paramanus, they are called a skandha which are more or less like a molecules. Part of skandha is called desha. Such sknadhas may be large or small. Small skandhas may be invisible to the eye, but they can be seen when the combinations are larger.\n\nKala refers to time that brings forth changes. Past, present, and future are the different modes of time and are measured in terms of years, months, days, hours, minutes or seconds. For practical purposes a second happens to be the finest measurement of time. Jainism however, recognizes a very small measurement of time known as \"samaya\" which is an infinitely small part of a second. \n\n\"Kala\" (time) is infinite, but there are cycles (\"kalachakra\"s) in it. Each cycle having two eras of equal duration described as the \"avasarpini\" and the \"utsarpini\". The former is a descending era in which virtue gradually decreases. The latter is an ascending era in which the reverse takes place. The present era is stated to be the former.\n\n<br>Indivisible time = 1 Samaya (smallest unit of measurement)\n<br>Countless Samayas = 1 Avalika\n<br>16,777,216 Avalikas = 1 Muhurt (48 minutes)\n<br>30 Muhurtas = 1 day and night\n<br>15 Days and nights = 1 Paksha\n<br>2 Pakshas = 1 Month\n<br>12 Months = 1 Year\n<br>Countless years = 1 Palyopam\n<br>1,000,000,000,000,000 (one quintillion) Palyopams = 1 Sagaropam; one quintillion is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000\n<br>1,000,000,000,000,000 Sagaropams = 1 Utsarpini or Avasarpini\n<br>1 Utsarpini or Avasarpini = 1 Kalchakra (One time cycle)\n\n"}

{"id": "1873914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873914", "title": "Veneti (Gaul)", "text": "Veneti (Gaul)\n\nThe Veneti (Gaulish: \"the kin, the friendly ones\") were a Gallic tribe who lived in Armorica (Brittany peninsula, France).\n\nA seafaring people, they strongly influenced south-west Brittonic culture by their trade. After they were defeated by Junius Brutus Albinus in a naval battle in 56 BCE, their maritime commerce eventually declined under the Roman Empire, although a prosperous agricultural life is indicated by archaeological evidence.\n\nThey are mentioned as \"Venetos\" by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC), Livy (late 1st c. BC) and Pliny (1st c. AD), as \"Ouénetoi\" (Οὐένετοι) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD) and Ptolemy (2nd c. AD), as \"Veneti\" on the \"Tabula Peutingeriana\" (5th c. AD), and as \"Benetis\" in the \"Notitia Dignitatum\" (5th c. AD). \n\nThe name \"Veneti\" stems from Gaulish \"uenet-\" ('kin, friendly', perhaps also 'merchants'), itself deriving from Proto-Celtic \"*wenyā\" ('family, kindred'; compare with Old Irish \"fine\"), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European \"*wenh₁-\" ('desire'; compare with OHG \"wini\" 'friend'). The root is attested in other parts of the Celtic linguistic area (\"Venedoti, Venetus Lacus\", etc.), and among Indo-European languages in general (Adriatic \"Veneti\", Vistula \"Veneti\", \"Eneti\").\n\nThe city of Vannes, attested as \"civitas Venetum\" ca. 400 ('civitas of the Veneti'; \"Venes\" in 1273) is named after the Gaulish tribe.\n\nThe Veneti built their strongholds on the tips of coastal spits or promontories, where shoals make approaching the headlands by sea dangerous, an unusual position which sheltered them from sea-borne attack.\n\nThey inhabited southern Armorica, along the Morbihan bay. Their most notable city, and probably their capital, was Darioritum (now known as Gwened in Breton or Vannes in French), mentioned in Ptolemy's \"Geography\". Other ancient Celtic peoples historically attested in Armorica include the Redones, Curiosolitae, Osismii, Esubii and Namnetes.\n\nCaesar reports in \"Bellum Gallicum\" that he sent in 57 BCE his \"protégé\", Publius Crassus, to deal with coastal tribes in Armorica (including the Veneti) in the context of a planned Roman invasion of Britain for the following year (which eventually went astray until 55 CE). Although Caesar claims that they were forced to submit to Roman power, there is no evidence of an initial opposition from the Gallic tribes, and the fact that Caesar only sent a single legion to negotiate with the Veneti suggests that no trouble was expected. Caesar's report is probably part of a political narrative set up to justify the conquest of Gauls and hide his aborted plan to invade Britain in 56 BCE.\" Scholar Michel Rambaud has argued that the Gauls initially thought they were making an alliance with the Romans, not surrendering.\n\nIn 56 BCE, the Veneti captured the commissaries Rome had sent to demand grain supplies in the winter of 57–56, in order to use them as bargaining chips to secure the release of the hostages they had previously surrendered to Caesar. Hearing of the nascent revolt, all the coastal Gaulish tribes bound themselves by oath to act in concert. This is the cause explicitly given by Caesar for the war.' This version is contradicted by Strabo, who contends that the Veneti aimed to stop Caesar's planned invasion of Britain, which would have threatened their trade relations with the island. Strabo's claim appears to be confirmed by the participation of other Gaulish tribes trading with Britain in the war, and by the involvement of Britons themselves.'\n\nCaesar had left for Illyricum at the beginning of the winter of 57–56. Informed of the events occurring in Armorica by Crassus, he launched the construction of a fleet of galleys, and placed orders for ships from the Pictones, Santones, and other 'pacified tribes'. War preparations were quickly achieved, and he joined the army 'as soon as the season permitted'. In response, the Veneti summoned help for further groups, including the Morini, Menapii and Britons.\"\n\nGiven the highly defensible nature of the Veneti strongholds, land attacks were frustrated by the incoming tide, and naval forces were left trapped on the rocks when the tide ebbed. Despite this, Caesar managed to engineer moles and raised siege-works that provided his legions with a base of operations. However, once the Veneti were threatened in one stronghold, they used their fleet to evacuate to another stronghold, obliging the Romans to repeat the same engineering feat elsewhere.\n\nJulius Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BCE, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both bodies of water when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain.\n\nSince the destruction of the enemy fleet was the only permanent way to end this problem, Caesar directed his men to build ships. However, his galleys were at a serious disadvantage compared to the far thicker Veneti ships. The thickness of their ships meant they were resistant to ramming, whilst their greater height meant they could shower the Roman ships with projectiles, and even command the wooden turrets which Caesar had added to his bulwarks. The Veneti manoeuvred so skilfully under sail that boarding was impossible. These factors, coupled with their intimate knowledge of the coast and tides, put the Romans at a disadvantage.\nHowever, Caesar's legate Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus was given command of the Roman fleet, and in a decisive battle, succeeded in destroying the Gaulish fleet in Quiberon Bay, with Caesar watching from the shore. Using long billhooks, the Romans struck at the enemy's halyards as they swept past (these must have been fastened out-board), having the effect of dropping the huge leathern mainsails to the deck, which crippled the vessel whether for sailing or rowing. The Romans were at last able to board, and the whole Veneti fleet fell into their hands.\n\nAccording to Caesar, the Veneti were the most influential tribe of Armorica, since they had the largest fleet, which they used for trade with Britain, and occupied a few harbours on the dangerous coasts of that region. This claim is evidenced by the fact that two officers (rather than one) went sent by the Romans to demand grain from them in the winter of 57–56 BCE.\n\nAccording to Strabo and Caesar, the Veneti had trading stations in Britain and regularly sailed to the island. Caesar further mentions that they charged customs and port dues on trade ships as they passed through the region, and Strabo suggests that they were also using the terrestrial routes and rivers of Armorica to trade with Britain.\n\nArchaeological evidence show a shift in trade with Britain from Armorica to the more north-easterly routes during the second half of the 1rst century BCE, following the Roman decisive victory over Gaulish Armorican tribes in 56 BCE.\n\nThe Veneti built their ships of oak with large transoms fixed by iron nails of a thumb's thickness. They navigated and powered their ships through the use of leather sails. This made their ships strong, sturdy and structurally sound, capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of the Atlantic. They controlled the tin trade from mining in Cornwall and Devon.\n\n\n"}

During World War II, the M3 and its variants were supplied to the U.S. Army and Marines, as well as British Commonwealth and Soviet Red Army forces, serving on all major fronts throughout the war. The M3 and its variants were produced by many manufacturers including Diamond T, White Motor Company and Autocar and were designed for a wide variety of uses, such as a self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon or self-propelled artillery. Although initially unpopular due to its lack of significant armor or a roof to protect the crew from shrapnel, it was used by most of the Allies during the war. \n\nIn the Cold War era, the vehicle was used by a variety of state and non-state operators in conflicts in South America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, remaining in service until as late as the mid-1990s. In Mexico they are still in use as of 2019.\n\nThe M3 half-track was long, wide, high and weighed . The wheelbase was long. The suspension consists of a leaf spring for the two front wheels, while the rear treads had vertical volute springs. With a fuel capacity of 60 US gallons (230 l), the M3 could carry its crew (one driver) and a squad of 12 soldiers before refueling, while protecting them from small arms with light armor (6–12 mm of armor). The vehicle was powered by a White 160AX, 386 in (6,330 cc), 6-cylinder gasoline engine, giving the vehicle a power-to-weight ratio of 15.8 hp/ton.\n\nThe design, which used many commercial components to improve reliability and the rate of production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. With a White 160AX engine, the M3 was driven through a manual constant-mesh (non-synchromesh) transmission with four forward and one reverse gear, as well as a two-speed transfer case. The front suspension uses leaf springs, while the tracks use vertical volute springs. Braking was hydraulic assisted while steering was manual. Onboard electronics run on a 12-volt system. The vehicle uses two tracks made of molded rubber over steel cabling with metal track guides.\n\nInfantry rifles were held in brackets behind the seats while ammunition and rations were generally stored underneath. In 1942, the vehicles were fitted with a small rack for land mines on the outside of the hull, just above the tracks. In combat, many squads found it necessary to stow additional rations, rucksacks and other crew stowage on the outside of the vehicle. Luggage racks were often added in the field, and later vehicles were fitted with rear-mounted racks for this purpose.\n\nEarly vehicles had a pintle mount, just behind the front seats, that mounted a .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine gun. The later M3A1 adopted a raised, armored pulpit mount for the .50-caliber and additional .30-caliber (7.62 mm) machine guns mounted along the sides of the passenger compartment. Many M3s were later converted to M3A1s. The body was fully armored, with an adjustable armored shutter for the engine radiator and a bulletproof windscreen.\n\nThe development of an armored half-track began with ordnance directive OCM 14188 to convert a M3 Scout Car into a half-track. The prototype was built at Rock Island Arsenal with help from White Motor Company and was designated the T7. It had the same chassis and engine as the M3, but had larger front wheels and a shorter front clip. The armor consisted of 1/4 inch of hardened armor plate and it was armed with two M1919 machine guns and one M2 Browning machine gun operated by a crew of eight. Tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1938 demonstrated unsatisfactory performance due to the front-wheel drive. The T7 was converted back into a scout car and returned to the Army.\n\nThroughout 1939 and 1940, the M2 half-track car was prototyped and developed by the Army at Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The M3 was developed as a larger version of the M2 equipped with two M1919 machine guns and an M2 Browning machine gun for combat usage. The M3 also added a rear door and five additional seats in the rear. The M3 was tested at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in the summer of 1941 and was accepted into service soon after.\n\nIn US service, it was intended that the M3 would be issued to armored infantry regiments. It was also quickly put into action with the Provisional Tank Group when the Japanese Army began their invasion of the Philippines. At first, there were multiple complaints due to several mechanical difficulties. These were rectified by the Ordnance Department after receiving field reports from the Philippines. The M3s first use in its intended role was during Operation Torch. Each armored division had 433 M2s or M3s, 200 in the armored regiments and 233 in the armored infantry regiment.\n\nThe half-tracks were initially unpopular and dubbed \"Purple Heart boxes\" (a grim reference to the US Army decoration for combat wounds) by American troops. The chief complaints centered on the complete lack of overhead protection from Air burst artillery shells and that the armor was inadequate against machine gun fire. Omar Bradley quoted in his report about half-tracks that it was \"a competent and dependable contrivance. Its bad name resulted from the inexperience of our troops who attempted to use it for too many things\". Another major issue with the M3 was its fixed rear idler, which often broke on rough terrain. Commanders in North Africa bought parts to build spring-loaded rear idlers that could handle the rough terrain, which the Ordnance Department then approved as an official fix. In 1943, the M3 served in Sicily and Italy and received positive reports of it in action. It operated in Operation Overlord and served in Europe for the remainder of the war.\n\nTotal production of the M3 and its variants ran to nearly 54,000 vehicles. To supply the Allied nations, International Harvester produced several thousand of a very similar vehicle, the M5 half-track, for Lend-Lease.\n\n\n\n\nVarious attempts were made to mate the 40 mm Bofors L/50 gun to the M3 chassis. In most cases the weapon's recoil was too severe or the mounting too heavy, and the attempts were finally stopped with the adoption of the M19 MGMC on the M24 light tank chassis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873943", "title": "WyoTech", "text": "WyoTech\n\nWyoTech, formerly known as Wyoming Technical Institute, is a for-profit, technical college founded in Laramie, Wyoming in 1966. WyoTech provides training programs that prepare students for careers as technicians in the automotive and diesel industry.\n\nIn July 2018, WyoTech was purchased from Zenith Education Group by a team of Wyoming locals, including former WyoTech president Jim Mathis. As of November 2018, the Laramie campus is the only location where classes are available.\n\nWyoTech was founded in 1966 as an automotive-themed school, offering programs in automotive repair. The first class in Laramie had 22 students, and its classes were housed in a 9,000 square foot building.\n\nIn 1969, WyoTech's Laramie campus became accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges, (ACCSC), formerly known as NATTS.\n\nCorinthian Colleges purchased Wyo-tech Acquisition Corporation on July 1, 2002, for $84.4 million in cash, which was 9.5 times EBITDA. At that point, there were two WyoTech campuses: One in Laramie, Wyoming, and a facility being constructed in Blairsville, Pennsylvania. The cohort default rate for WyoTech was 7.2 in 1998 and 5.0% in 1999.\n\nCorinthian College's rationale for the relatively high purchase price and swift expansion was based on Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) forecasts for a high demand for automotive technicians and a significant turnover of workers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) forecasted a 16.7% increase in auto technicians, from 790,000 in 1998 to approximately 922,000 by 2008. WyoTech became part of Titan Schools, Inc., Corinthian College's technical division. Titan Schools offered degree and diploma programs in aeronautical maintenance, heating/ventilation/air conditioning and plumbing technology as well as the automotive and diesel programs.\n\nIn December 2003, the Blairsville campus moved into expanded facilities at 500 Innovation Drive, which was considered a boon for the rural working-class Pennsylvania town. The Laramie campus also added a 75,000-square-foot building in 2003.\n\nIn a January 2003, Corinthian Colleges' earnings called WyoTech a \"tremendous acquisition\" and it was reported that 600,000 square feet of space were added to WyoTech. In October of the same year, Corinthian Colleges CFO Dennis Beal stated that WyoTech was using high school recruiters nationwide \"to sell everything from aviation maintenance, HVAC programs and things of that nature in addition to their auto and diesel repair.\"\n\nIn January 2004, Corinthian Colleges reported that the Blairsville campus was projected to break even in the next 12–18 months. \nIn February 2004, Senator Rick Santorum visited the Blairsville WyoTech, stating that \"the expansion is good news for Indiana County...Training centers like this offer students a competitive advantage when entering the workforce.\" When completed, the Blairsville WyoTech campus was expected to encompass 250,000 square feet.\n\nBy August 2004, WyoTech had seven sites, adding campuses in Boston (August 2003), Fremont, California (August 2003), Sacramento (January 2004), Oakland (March 2004), and Daytona Beach (August 2004). The Daytona campus offered programs to prepare students for jobs as motorcycle, marine, and personal watercraft technicians.\n\nIn 2004, more than 30 Laramie, Wyoming, WyoTech students, teachers and alums were featured on The Learning Channel's Overhaulin' series. The '56 Chevy that they redesigned was showcased in various venues by WyoTech and the WTI Foundation to \"increase awareness of the foundation's efforts to provide scholarship funding to deserving students.\"\n\nIn 2006, on the PR Newswire, WyoTech boasted of having seven schools nationwide, with more than 6,000 students. Courses in diesel technology began in 2006 and the Blairsville campus added light duty diesel and high-performance power trains advanced courses in 2007. WyoTech also formed a partnership with Summit Racing Equipment, the world's largest direct marketer of high performance automotive parts.\n\nBy late 2006, Corinthian Colleges reported that they had a team of more than 100 WyoTech admissions representatives and that each WyoTech student generated \"monthly revenue 2-3 times higher than the monthly revenue generated by a typical Diploma or Associate Degree student.\" The same September report noted \"some erosion in start growth.\" The Pittsburgh Tribune Review also reported that the Blairsville community had mixed reviews about the growth of the school and its perceived effects on the community. Some felt fortunate for the positive economic effects. Others blamed a surge in vandalism, underage drinking, traffic violations and petty theft on this growth.\n\nIn January 2007, Corinthian Colleges reported that WyoTech's \"\"show rate\"\" (the percentage of students who enroll and then show up for class) had fallen well below historic levels. In the same report, Corinthian Colleges stated that they had \"come to understand that the challenges in that business are deeper than previously anticipated.\" In response, Corinthian Colleges hired \nFrank Stryjewski as division president of WyoTech. Mr. Stryjewski had previously served as senior vice president operations for Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corporation.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, WyoTech divested from its Boston and Oakland campuses, which offered aviation maintenance. The Boston campus was sold in 2008 and the Oakland campus was expected to be sold in 2009.\n\nIn September 2010, WyoTech stopped enrolling students without a high school diploma or its equivalent, to reduce student loan defaults. However, this also reduced enrollment.\n\nIn 2011, WyoTech reported that its schools had some of the highest graduation rates of any two-year schools in the United States. WyoTech Blairsville had a graduation rate of 85.1 percent, and WyoTech Laramie a graduation rate of 80.1 percent. However, WyoTech's student loan default rates had risen to 16.8% at the Blairsville campus and 17.2% at the Laramie campus. A 2011 report by California Watch found that student loan default rates in 2009 were an alarming 27.4% at Long Beach and 24.6% in Fremont.\n\nIn its 2011 investigation and 2012 report, The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions also highlighted Corinthian Colleges, WyoTech's parent company, as a predatory corporation that misled students about costs and gainful employment. In HELP documents, the committee noted that the Long Beach WyoTech had a student loan default rate of 36.6%.\n\nFrom July 2011 to July 2014, Corinthian Colleges loaned students funds with its high interest in-house \"Genesis Loans\".\n\nIn 2012, WyoTech divested from its campuses in Sacramento and Daytona Beach. It also reported that its trademarks had been impaired by regulatory uncertainties surrounding gainful employment. \nIn 2013, WyoTech partnered with Mack Trucks and Volvo Trucks to create a curriculum for the new Diesel Advanced Technology Education for Mack Trucks and Volvo Trucks. However, WyoTech schools faced layoffs and site closings as Corinthian Colleges, its parent company, received greater government scrutiny for its questionable business and trading practices. One of the major criticisms of WyoTech and other for-profit colleges was that \ntuition was typically 300% to 400% more expensive than programs at community colleges, which triggered higher student loan default rates. Due to a lack of acceptable offers to buy the Daytona Beach campus, WyoTech continued operations there.\n\nIn a 2014 expose, The Center for Investigative Reporting found that three of WyoTechs' California campuses received more than $32 million in GI Bill funds during a 5-year span. WyoTech was labeled as a subprime college because its parent company, Corinthian Colleges, had used false and misleading advertising to recruit students.\n\nIn February 2015, Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) bought three WyoTech campuses and the remaining Everest College campuses under the name Zenith Education Group.\n\nOn April 27, 2015, Zenith Education Group closed its three WyoTech campuses in California, leaving the campuses in Laramie, Blairsville, and Daytona Beach remaining. A report by the US Department of Education found that WyoTech's placement rates in California were 2% to 14% below what WyoTech had claimed.\n\nIn July 2018, WyoTech was purchased by a local ownership group based in Laramie, Wyoming. Headed by former WyoTech president Jim Mathis, the new leadership team oversees operations of the Laramie campus. All other WyoTech campuses that operated under the previous ownership team remain closed.\n\nWyoTech is nationally accredited but not regionally accredited. Most public and private universities are regionally accredited and do not accept credits or degrees from WyoTech for transfer.\n\nAs of July 2018, the only operating WyoTech campus is located in Laramie, Wyoming.\n\n\nWyoTech degrees are completed in nine months, six months of Core classes and then three months of an Elective program.\n\nCore Classes - Diplomas and Certificates are available in the following subjects:\n\n\nElectives - Specialty courses offered to students who complete Core Classes:\n\nIn 2008, nine former WyoTech students who took heating and air-conditioning classes in Fremont claimed they had taken out student loans for as much as $40,000 each, but their training did not make them employable. According to the suit, instructors sometimes appeared to be drunk, fell asleep in class and could not answer basic questions, and equipment was outdated.\n\nIn 2013, WyoTech's parent company at the time, Corinthian Colleges, was sued by the state of California for \"false and predatory advertising, intentional misrepresentations to students, securities fraud and unlawful use of military seals in advertisements.\" and there are numerous other actions filed against Corinthian in various U.S. states as well as United States agencies.\n\nIn July 2014, Corinthian Colleges agreed they would close or sell all their schools in the next few months. The U.S. Department of Education announced former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, a well known corruption buster, would monitor the sale and closure of for-profit career colleges owned by the failing Corinthian Colleges.\n\nOn February 3, 2015, Corinthian sold 53 of its Everest and WyoTech campuses and online programs to the Zenith Education Group, a new subsidiary of the ECMC Group.\n\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, approximately 17-24% of WyoTech students have defaulted on their student loans.\n\nOn June 8, 2015, the US Department of Education announced that it was developing a process that would allow former students of Corinthian schools to apply for debt relief, if they believed they were victims of fraud. While the Department has still not created a formal process, they have provided the outlines of what borrowers should submit if they wish to pursue debt cancellation on the Federal Student Aid website. In addition, the advocacy group the Debt Collective has created its own, unofficial \"Defense to Repayment App\" that allows former students of Corinthian and other schools accused of fraud to pursue debt cancellation. The applications generated through the Debt Collective's online form was cited by the Department of Education in a Federal Register notice, which said that \"a need for a clearer process for potential claimants\" arose due to the submission of over 1000 defense to repayment claims by \"a building debt activism movement.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1873949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873949", "title": "Wiślica", "text": "Wiślica\n\nWiślica is a town in Busko County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Wiślica. It lies on the Nida River, approximately south of Busko-Zdrój and south of the regional capital Kielce. In 2016 the town had a population of 503. It was the smallest town in Poland in 2018.\n\nWiślica is one of the most ancient settlements in Poland, and has played an important role in Polish history. The town was founded more than 1000 years ago, close to the important commercial routes, running from Kraków to Sandomierz. At that time it was probably the capital of the famous tribe Vistulans. The land of Vistulans, after coming under temporary rule of Great Moravian and Bohemia, was incorporated into Poland by Mieszko I in 990. The first guarded settlement was probably founded at the end of the 9th century. The remains that survive today are of the settlement which was erected at the end of the 12th century. The city had regular streets, the well was inlaid with stones, and a water cistern and the remains of 47 wooden houses have been found. The area compromised ten sub-settlements, whose inhabitants worked for the needs of the city. It is very likely that the city was burnt down by Tatars during famous invasion of 1241 and it was never again inhabited by settlers.\n\nIn the late 1950s, archaeologists discovered the foundations of the St. Nicholas church, dating back to the 10th or 11th century, which is exposed at the museum pavilion. The church was small: 6.65 m long and 3.40 m. wide, with one aisle, and a semicircular apse. It is one of the oldest churches in market settlements of the Małopolska region.\n\nThe famous gypsum baptismal font located under the foundation of the church became a scientific sensation and the subject of heated discussions after its discovery. Probably it was served as a font for collective baptising in the 9th century. If so, it would be the place of the earliest baptism on Polish grounds. This event is mentioned in \"Life of st. Methodius\" as, so-called \"Pannonian Legend\".\n\nIn the 12th century Wiślica became an important centre of court, intellectual and political life. It was given the status of outstanding cultural centre by the wife of prince Casimir the Just. In the years 1166–1173 the town was the capital of the duchy of Wiślica. This is probably when the truly royal, unique in Poland, residential complex consisting two big palaces and the additional round chapels was erected. Also another church was founded. Its remains are hidden in Basilica vaults among the relicts of third Wiślica's sanctuary. Their discoveries turned out to be a great sensation, especially the floor of the burial crypt of the first Romanesque church built in this place around 1170. It is the priceless work of the art and monument of Romanesque style.\n\nLocated in the burial crypt of the 12th-century church, so-called Slab of Orants is a gypsum panel with engravings filled with black paste mixed with charcoal. It's showing two fields with plain figures separated and surrounded by decorated strips fringes, showing mythological creatures: griffins, a female centaur and the tree of life. Probably the figures represents prince Henry of Sandomierz and Kazimir the Just with their families. It is also a burial place of Henry of Sandomierz. The church with Slab of Orants was replaced in the 13th century by bigger, three-aisled basilica. Its remains are still visible in the vaults and are represented by decorative ceramic floor.\n\nAround half of 14th century another church was erected by king Casimir the Great. It is a beautiful example of the Gothic style in architecture while the most precious buildings of its kind in southern Poland. Also, it is a finest example of very rare two-aisled type churches. The Basilica interior is richly decorated by precious and unique wall paintings. They were commissioned around 1400 by king Vladislau Jagiello in his favourite Ruthenian-Byzantine style. Next to the basilica two buildings founded by Jan Długosz has been preserved. In 1442 he became a cantor in the Wiślica church and two years later its curator. Around 1460 he founded the belfry and a building for 12 canons and 12 assistant curates, which is today a rare monument of medieval residential architecture.\n\nWiślica was granted charter rights by king Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1326. Since this time it was a place of frequent political gatherings, as well as the place of reading out of Wiślica Statutes. His son, King Casimir the Great built the towns fortified walls with three gates and the castle which was later pulled down. The town's spacious layout changed in those years. The new center of Wiślica was located on the commercial route, so-called Via Salis. New bridges on the river Nida were constructed. Wiślica was granted important privileges, toll customs on the bridges, the exemption of towns people custom duties and the right of storing salt. The brewery of Wiślica was known as producing the excellent beer, which was delivered to Kraków for the royal table.\n\nFrom the 14th century Wiślica was the capital of a land, from the 15th century it was a county capital and the seat of starosta. In 1528 king Sigismund I the Old granted Wiślica the right to build municipal water works. By the end of the 16th century, the town was destroyed by successive fires, floods and epidemic, began to fall into the oblivion. The towns ultimate destruction took place in 1657 during the Swedish Deluge. Although Wiślica remained the county capital until the end of the 18th century, it never regained its previous splendor. In 1795 it became part of Austria as a result of the Third Partition of Poland.\n\nFrom 1809 it was in the Duchy of Warsaw, then from 1815 in the Congress Poland under Russian rule, and again in independent Poland since 1918. Wiślica lost its city charter in 1870, and it was again destroyed in the course of the First World War, in 1915.\n\nIn 1939 during the Invasion of Poland heavy fighting occurred near the village. In the course of the German occupation that followed, Wiślica's Jewish community perished in The Holocaust. Unfortunately, today Wiślica is still forgotten and marginalised by bigger intellectual centres, but remains as a charming town which offers monuments of great artistic merit, of long traditions and memories of important historical events.\n\nOn 1 January 2018 Wiślica regained its city charter, thus becoming the smallest town in Poland. \nBy comparison, the largest village in Poland (Kozy), had 12 529 inhabitants (as for 31.12.2013).\n\n\n\n\n"}

H. Solomon (R-NY) sponsored a series of \"Solomon amendments\" that conditioned eligibility for federal financial aid for higher education and job training, federal government employment, and other federal benefits on certification by the individual that they either had registered with the Selective Service System or were not required to register. This was successfully challenged in federal District Court in 1983 on the grounds that it determined guilt and inflicted punishment without judicial process. The Supreme Court reversed that decision in \"Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group\" (1984).\n\nThe Solomon Amendment relating to ROTC and military recruiting was passed in 1996. It denied federal grants from 8 federal agencies, including research grants, to colleges and universities that prohibit or prevent the U.S. armed forces from recruiting on campus in a manner \"at least equal in quality and scope\" as other employers or that fail to allow for ROTC programs as part of their academic programs subject to the same standards as other academic programs. It was recodified in 1999. The law was amended in 2002 to cover recruiting by the Coast Guard as part of the Department of Homeland Security. It also provides an exception for any institution with \"a longstanding policy of pacifism based on historical religious affiliation.\"\n\nIt was revised in later years, most importantly in 1999, when Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) sponsored an exemption for financial aid funding (Pub L. 106-79 Sec. 8120), and again in 2001, when the Republican leadership of the House Armed Services Committee included language denying all federal funding to a university if any of its schools blocked access to recruiters. This alteration significantly strengthened the reach of the Solomon Amendment, since recruiters were most often denied access to law schools, which receive little federal money.\n\nSince 1991, the Association of American Law Schools, the principal consortium of United States law schools, required that all of its member institutions establish a policy prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and that member schools require the same policy of any employer to which it grants access for recruiting employees. Many law schools used to oppose military recruitment on campus because the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy denying employment in the military to open gays and lesbians contradicted their non-discrimination policies.\n\nIn 2004, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals found for the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, a group representing law schools, led by Professor Kent Greenfield of Boston College Law School, opposed to the presence of military recruiters on campus.\n\nOn appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Rumsfeld v. FAIR\" upheld the Solomon Amendment in a unanimous decision on March 6, 2006. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, wrote: \"As a general matter, the Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech. It affects what law schools must do—afford equal access to military recruiters—not what they may or may not say.\"\n\nAt least two institutions (Vermont Law School, and William Mitchell College of Law) have declined to allow military recruiting on campus in the past. Both positions were taken as a protest to the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. These schools receive little in way of federal funds compared to large research universities, making it more feasible to forgo the federal funding. With the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\" in 2011, both schools removed their bans on campus military recruiting.\n\n"}

Clarke\n\nThe Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke, first published in 2001, is a collection of almost all science fiction stories written by Arthur C. Clarke. It includes 114 stories, arranged in order of publication, from \"Travel by Wire!\" in 1937 through to \"Improving the Neighbourhood\" in 1999. The story \"Improving The Neighbourhood\" has the distinction of being the first fiction published in the journal \"Nature\". The titles \"Venture to the Moon\" and \"The Other Side of the Sky\" are not stories, but the titles of groups of six interconnected stories, each story with its own title. This collection is only missing a very few stories, for example \"When the Twerms Came\", which appears in his other collections \"More Than One Universe\" and \"The View from Serendip\". This edition contains a foreword by Clarke written in 2000, where he speculates on the science fiction genre in relation to the concept of short stories. Furthermore, many of the stories have a short introduction about their publication history or literary nature.\n\nIn addition to the printed edition, an audio edition was published by Fantastic Audio in 2001. The audio edition, comprising five volumes, runs nearly fifty hours. An electronic edition of the book was published in four volumes by RosettaBooks in 2012.\n\nOf the above 114 pieces, 95 were published in six major short story collections during Clarke's lifetime. They are distributed as follows (all cross-references with the above list are noted):\n\nNote that nos. 50 and 68 above are not short stories but two cycles of six pieces each.\n\nLater collections consist mostly of previously collected material, with the following exceptions (all cross-references with the above list are noted):\n\nAs can be seen, of these 12 \"new stories\", 10 are reprinted in \"The Collected Stories\". The missing ones are a movie outline of \"The Songs of Distant Earth\" (from \"The Sentinel\"; this is not the short story of the same name) and a short sketch titled \"When the Twerms Came\", which originally appeared in Clarke's non-fiction book \"The View from Serendip\" (1978) and was later reprinted in the 1987 edition of \"The Wind from the Sun\".\n\nFor the remaining nine pieces (2, 4, 17, 29, 30, 112, 114–116) this is either their first appearance in book form at all or first appearance in a book by Arthur C. Clarke. There are, however, two exceptions. \"The Lion of Comarre\" (no. 17), although published in magazine form as early as 1949, first appeared in book form in 1968, in an omnibus edition together with Clarke's early novel \"Against the Fall of the Night\" (1953). \"The Steam-powered Word-Processor\" (no. 112) had previously appeared in Clarke's \"science-fictional autobiography\" \"Astounding Days\" (1989).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873971", "title": "Virotherapy", "text": "Virotherapy\n\nVirotherapy is a treatment using biotechnology to convert viruses into therapeutic agents by reprogramming viruses to treat diseases. There are three main branches of virotherapy: anti-cancer oncolytic viruses, viral vectors for gene therapy and viral immunotherapy. These branches utilize three different types of treatment methods: gene overexpression, gene knockout, and suicide gene delivery. Gene overexpression adds genetic sequences that compensate for low to zero levels of needed gene expression. Gene knockout utilizes RNA methods to silence or reduce expression of disease-causing genes. Suicide gene delivery introduces genetic sequences that induce an apoptotic response in cells, usually to kill cancerous growths. In a slightly different context, virotherapy can also refer more broadly to the use of viruses to treat certain medical conditions by killing pathogens.\n\nOncolytic virotherapy is not a new idea – as early as the mid 1950s doctors were noticing that cancer patients who suffered a non-related viral infection, or who had been vaccinated recently, showed signs of improvement; this has been largely attributed to the production of interferon and tumour necrosis factors in response to viral infection, but oncolytic viruses are being designed that selectively target and lyse only cancerous cells.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, studies were conducted in animal models to evaluate the use of viruses in the treatment of tumours. In the 1940s–1950s some of the earliest human clinical trials with oncolytic viruses were started.\n\nIn 2015 the FDA approved the marketing of talimogene laherparepvec, a genetically engineered herpes virus, to treat melanoma lesions that cannot be operated on; it is injected directly into the lesion. As of 2016 there was no evidence that it extends the life of people with melanoma, or that it prevents metastasis. Two genes were removed from the virus – one that shuts down an individual cell's defenses, and another that helps the virus evade the immune system – and a gene for human GM-CSF was added. The drug works by replicating in cancer cells, causing them to burst; it was also designed to stimulate an immune response but as of 2016, there was no evidence of this. The drug was created and initially developed by BioVex, Inc. and was continued by Amgen, which acquired BioVex in 2011. It was the first oncolytic virus approved in the West.\n\nViral gene therapy uses genetically engineered viral vectors to deliver therapeutic genes to cells with genetic malfunctions. Typically, the virus is administered to patients intravenously or by direct injection into target tissues. The molecular mechanisms of gene delivery and/or integration into cells vary based on the viral vector that is used.\n\nThere are many targets of viral gene therapy. While some therapies target the missing or mutated genes of inherited genetic disorders, others seek to deliver new genes to cancer cells in order to destroy tumors.\n\nCurrently, immune responses to viral gene therapies pose a challenge to successful treatment. However, responses to viral vectors at immune privileged sites such as the eye may be reduced compared to other sites of the body.\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, in which attenuated or killed virus/bacteria is used to generate an immune response, viral immunotherapy uses genetically engineered viruses to present a specific antigen to the immune system. That antigen could be from any species of virus/bacteria or even human disease antigens, for example cancer antigens.\n\nVaccines are another method of virotherapy that use attenuated or inactivated viruses to develop immunity to disease. An attenuated virus is a weakened virus that incites a natural immune response in the host that is often undetectable. The host also develops potentially life-long immunity due to the attenuated virus's similarity to the actual virus. Inactivated viruses are killed viruses that present a form of the antigen to the host. However, long-term immune response is limited.\n\nThere are two general approaches to develop these viruses using applied evolutionary techniques: Jennerian and Pastorian. The Jennerian method involves selecting similar viruses\nfrom non-human organisms to protect against a human virus while Pastorian methods use serial passage. This Pastorian method is very similar to directive evolution of oncolytic viruses. Selected viruses that target humans are passed through multiple non-human organisms for multiple generations. Over time the viruses adapt to the foreign environments of their new hosts. These now maladapted viruses have minimal capacity for harming humans and are used as attenuated viruses for clinical use. An important consideration is to not reduce the replicative ability of the virus beyond the point where the immune system response will be compromised. A secondary immune response would therefore be insufficient to provide protection against the live virus should it be reintroduced to the host.\n\nRIGVIR is a virotherapy drug that was approved by the State Agency of Medicines of the Republic of Latvia in 2004. It is wild type ECHO-7, a member of echovirus family. The potential use of echovirus as an oncolytic virus to treat cancer was discovered by Latvian scientist Aina Muceniece in the 1960s and 1970s. The data used to register the drug in Latvia is not sufficient to obtain approval to use it in the US, Europe, or Japan. As of 2017 there was no good evidence that RIGVIR is an effective cancer treatment. On March 19th, 2019, the manufacturer of ECHO-7, SIA LATIMA, announced the drug's removal from sale in Latvia, quoting financial and strategic reasons and insufficient profitability. However, several days later an investigative TV show revealed that State Agency of Medicines had run laboratory tests on the vials, and found that the amount of ECHO-7 virus is of a much smaller amount than claimed by the manufacturer. According to agency's lab director, \"It's like buying what you think is lemon juice, but finding that what you have is lemon-flavored water\". In March 2019, the distribution of ECHO-7 in Latvia has been stopped. \n\nCurrently, there are many viral gene therapy products in clinical trial phases. Listed below are the products that are (or were) approved for marketing in the US and/or European Union.\n\n\nViruses have been explored as a means to treat infections caused by protozoa. One such protozoa that potential virotherapy treatments have explored is Naegleria fowleri which causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). With a mortality rate of 95%, this disease-causing eukaryote has one of the highest pathogenic fatalities known. Chemotherapeutic agents that target this amoeba for treating PAM have difficulty crossing blood-brain barriers. However, the driven evolution of virulent viruses of protozoal pathogens (VVPPs) may be able to develop viral therapies that can more easily access this eukaryotic disease by crossing the blood-brain barrier in a process analogous to bacteriophages. These VVPPs would also be self-replicating and therefore require infrequent administration with lower doses, thus potentially reducing toxicity. While these treatment methods for protozoal disease may show great promise in a manner similar to bacteriophage viral therapy, a notable hazard is the evolutionary consequence of using viruses capable of eukaryotic pathogenicity. VVPPs will have evolved mechanisms of DNA insertion and replication that manipulate eukaryotic surface proteins and DNA editing proteins. VVPP engineering must therefore control for viruses that may be able to mutate and thereby bind to surface proteins and manipulate the DNA of the infected host.\n\nChester M. Southam, a researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, pioneered the study of viruses as potential agents to treat cancer.\n\n"}

Despite experiences of the Second Sino-Japanese War, armored personnel carriers were viewed as too slow compared to wheeled trucks and there was not much effort for their development in the army.\n\nProduction began in 1944 with the Type 1 Ho-Ha being an addition to the Type 1 Ho-Ki, an unrelated, yet similarly named armored tracked personnel carrier. The half-tracked Type 1 Ho-Ha was built by Hino Motors in unknown quantities.\n\nThe Type 1 Ho-Ha was based on the German Sd.Kfz. 251/1 (known popularly as \"Hanomag\"), the main armoured personnel carrier of the German Army, but did not use the overlapped and interleaved road wheels of the German design's suspension. Further, it had a \"vertical rear plate with a door\", akin to the American M3 Half-track; however, the door itself was a copy of the German \"two-leaf\" design.\n\nThe Type 1 Ho-Ha had a pair of road wheels in front, supported by a pair of short caterpillar tracks to the rear. It was equipped with a tow coupling in the front and a towing hitch at the rear to haul artillery or a supply trailer. The maximum armor thickness was 8 mm with sloping armor plates. As with the Type 1 Ho-Ki, the hull was welded construction and it was \"open-topped\".\n\nThe Type 1 Ho-Ha carried three Type 97 light machine guns as standard armament, one on each side, just to the rear of the driver's compartment and a third mounted to the rear as an anti-aircraft weapon. All of these weapons had constricted firing arcs, which made firing directly forward or directly rearward impossible.\n\nThe Type 1 Ho-Ha was initially deployed to China for operations in the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War, but never in any great numbers. It was later deployed with the Japanese reinforcements in the Battle of the Philippines in 1944. Post-war, some Type 1 Ho-Ha half-tracks were modified by cutting off the rear armored section and replacing it with a flat bed. They were then used for reconstruction work in areas of the country.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1873976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873976", "title": "United States Marine Band", "text": "United States Marine Band\n\nThe United States Marine Band is the premier band of the United States Marine Corps. Established by act of Congress on July 11, 1798, it is the oldest of the United States military bands and the oldest professional musical organization in the United States. Today, the Marine Band also includes the Marine Chamber Orchestra and Marine Chamber Ensembles.\n\nThe Marine Band is entirely separate from its sister military band, the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps (\"The Commandant's Own\") and the 10 active duty Marine Corps field bands.\n\nThe Marine Band has been uniquely known as \"The President's Own\" since 1801 due to the historic connection to the President of the United States. The relationship between the Marine Band and the White House began on New Year's Day 1801, when President John Adams invited the band to perform at the Executive Mansion. Later that year, Thomas Jefferson initiated the tradition of Marine Band performances by requesting that it perform at his inauguration. The Marine Band has played at every United States presidential inauguration since. President Thomas Jefferson gave the title \"The President's Own\" in 1801. This terminology emulated a long-established British usage, where various military units were designated as \"King's Own\" or \"Queen's Own\".\n\nToday, the Marine Band performs in approximately 500 events every year including state funerals, state arrival ceremonies, state dinners, parades, concerts, and other social events. The Marine Band also travels across the country each October and November during its fall concert tour, a tradition that began in 1891 under its most famous director, composer John Philip Sousa.\n\nThe Marine Band recruits experienced musicians; members are selected through a rigorous audition procedure and must satisfy additional security and physical requirements to be eligible. Selected band members serve under a four-year contract as active duty enlisted Marines and are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and physical standards. Members of The President's Own and the United States Coast Guard Band are the only members of the United States Armed Forces not required to undergo recruit training and do not perform combat missions. Also, they are not assigned to any unit other than the Marine Band. Musicians of other Marine bands are required to attend boot camp and Marine Combat Training (MCT).\n\nThe 'President's Own' band members start at the rank of Staff Sergeant, and wear rank insignia with a lyre replacing the normal crossed rifles. Commissioned officers are often drawn from within the band, although auditions are open to members of all Marine Corps bands. Drum majors are career Marines and are selected from the Marine Corps field bands, as they are responsible for the military development of the band's members. As of 2010, the USMC spends about $10 million annually to support the band.\n\nIn 2005, Sara Sheffield became the first female feature vocalist in the band's history.\n\nThe Marine Band's performance schedule is coordinated by the Marine Band Branch of Headquarters Marine Corps Public Affairs, which works with the Director of the Marine Band and the Marine Band Operations Office to schedule performances and ceremonies by the band, chamber orchestra, and chamber ensembles.\n\nThe Marine Band also has a professional support staff (Library, Recording Lab, Stage Managers, and Stage Crew) as well as the Administration, Public Affairs, and Supply offices, who work to coordinate, promote, and facilitate performances throughout the year.\n\nThe full band has a complement of about 130 members, although they all play together only rarely.\n\nA 42-piece band is used for all Pentagon and formal military arrivals and patriotic openers for large events. Patriotic openers are 15 minutes of patriotic music, including the presentation and retirement of the colors, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" (national anthem), and the \"Marines' Hymn.\" Patriotic openers are performed throughout the Washington metropolitan area at a variety of events for military organizations, federal agencies, and associations.\n\nEvents that the Marine Band participates in include:\n\nThe early leadership of the Marine Band consisted of both a Drum Major and a Fife Major, who wore identical uniforms. The Drum Major was considered the Leader of the Marine Band, while the Fife Major's responsibility was to train the fifers. The first leader of the United States Marine Band was William Farr, who is listed in historical records as having served as Drum Major from January 21, 1799.\n\nAfter the retirement of Drum Major Raphael Triay in 1855, then-Fife Major Francis Scala became Drum Major. On July 25, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln signed an Act of Congress to reorganize the Marine Band. This act abolished the rank of Fife Major (and in 1881 the fife was removed from Marine Corps instrumentation entirely), created the positions of Leader of the Band/Principal Musician, Drum Major, and authorized 30 musicians. Scala was the first Marine Band musician to receive the title \"Leader of the Band\"; John Roach was selected as Drum Major.\n\nThe earliest recorded Second Leader of the United States Marine Band was Salvador Petrola. Marine Band cornetist Walter F. Smith, who had performed under 17th director, John Philip Sousa, became the first official Second Leader when an Act of Congress established the positions of First Leader and Second Leader of the Marine Band in March 1899.\n\nMany changes took place during the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration. The titles First Leader and Second Leader were replaced by Director and Assistant Director. When Albert F. Schoepper was appointed as Director in 1955, a second Assistant Director was added to the Marine Band leadership. Today, the Assistant Director positions are designated in two titles: Senior Assistant Director and Executive Officer, and Assistant Director. It is also during the Eisenhower administration that the first \"Soloist and Moderator\" was appointed. William D. Jones, known as the original soloist with the new US Air Force Band and originator and director of the Singing Sergeants, was transferred by an Act of Congress to the USMC Band and given the title \"Ambassador of Music.\" The Soloist and Moderator served as the senior enlisted member until 1972, when Schoepper and Jones retired.\n\nToday, the Drum Major serves as the senior enlisted member of \"The President's Own\" and is responsible for the band's appearance, ceremonial drill, and military decorum. He is charged with directing the band in ceremonies, including the inaugural parade, and regularly leads the band in review for presidents and visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.\n\nThe Drum Major's uniform is unique; he wears a bearskin headpiece and carries a ceremonial mace used to signal commands to the musicians. The drum major also wears the officer's version of the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor (the Marine Corps emblem). He also wears an ornate baldric, similar to a sash, embroidered with the band's crest and the Marine Corps' battle honors, as well as miniatures of his own medals.\n\nSousa composed several of his finest marches, including \"Semper Fidelis\", while serving as director of the Marine Band.\n\nThomas Powell Knox joined the Marine Band in 1961 as a trumpet player and moved to the arranging staff in 1966. Three years later, Knox was appointed chief arranger and continued to compose and arrange for the Marine Band until his retirement in 1985. Some of his more notable compositions include \"God of Our Fathers\" (commissioned for Ronald Reagan's first inauguration) and \"American Pageant,\" which was commissioned for Richard Nixon's first inauguration. Knox arranged or composed over 300 pieces, many of which are still played by the Marine Band and other bands across America.\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873986", "title": "Huskie Stadium", "text": "Huskie Stadium\n\nBrigham Field at Huskie Stadium is a college football stadium in the central United States, located on the campus of Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois. Opened in 1965, it is the home field of the NIU Huskies of the Mid-American Conference (MAC).\n\nLocated on the west end of campus, Huskie Stadium is bordered by Stadium Drive to the south, the Yordon Athletic Center to the north, Mary Bell Field to the east, and Ralph McKinzie Field to the west. The playing field has a conventional north-south alignment at an elevation of above sea level.\n\nBefore the 1965 season, the Huskies played at Glidden Field, a 5,500-seat facility on the east end of campus. However, after quarterback George Bork lead them to an AP small college national championship in 1963, they began the construction of Huskie Stadium. Marred by construction setbacks that put the opening day two months behind schedule, the stadium played host to its first official NIU football game on November 6, when the Huskies defeated the Illinois State Redbirds, 48–6. Through 1968, the playing surface was natural grass.\n\nIn 1969, the home opener against Idaho on September 20 marked the state's first major college gridiron contest played on artificial turf, and the Huskies won the night game, 47–30. The field was re-carpeted in 1980 and 1990 before the introduction of infilled FieldTurf in 2001.\n\nThe stadium originally consisted of the main concrete west stands (which used to contain practice facilities for the gymnastics and wrestling teams) and much smaller temporary stands on the east side. The east side was completely redone in 1995, creating a steel structure to mirror the concrete one. The university has maintained and enhanced the institution's all-around athletics facility, updating the scoreboard and video display system in both 2000 and 2001, and creating the South End Zone berm in 2002. In 2003, the field was renamed \"Brigham Field\" in honor of Robert J. Brigham, a former NIU player, coach, and athletic director.\n\nThe stadium was also the site of a few NCAA records. Against Fresno State in 1990, quarterback Stacey Robinson rushed for 287 yards in the first half, and finished with 308 overall, as NIU upset the 24th-ranked Bulldogs 73–18. In that game on October 6, the Huskies established school records for rushing yards (733), total offense (806), and first downs (36). It was also the first victory over a ranked opponent at the stadium. In 2013, Jordan Lynch rushed for 321 yards on November 26, setting an FBS record for most rushing yards in a game by a quarterback.\n\nThe Huskies have experienced large amounts of success in the national spotlight, defeating the Alabama Crimson Tide, the Iowa State Cyclones,Purdue, Northwestern, Nebraska, and the Maryland Terrapins. Because of the Huskies success, NIU averaged the highest attendance per game in the MAC between 2004-2006.\n\nIn recent years, the football program has generated national headlines for the institution. With seven consecutive winning seasons (best in the MAC), NIU has the 25th best record in the nation since 2000 (53–30)---including triumphs over Bowl Championship Series programs such as Wake Forest, Minnesota, University of Alabama, Kansas, University of Maryland, Purdue University (2009, 2013), Iowa, and Iowa State University among others. The Huskies finished ranked in the Top 30 during the 2003 and 2004 seasons and defeated Troy University, 34–21, in the 2004 Silicon Valley Football Classic. In 2006, NIU faced off against TCU in the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego, California making it the second time in three years NIU had gone to a postseason bowl game. The Huskies made it four bowls in six years with a trip to the International Bowl in 2010 against the University of South Florida. Later, in 2012, they became the first non-AQ team with one loss to go to a BCS bowl game (Orange Bowl).\nWith the addition of the Yordon Athletic Center, the total capacity for the stadium has decreased to 23,595. In 2013, Huskie Stadium in its current seating format recorded two sellouts in the year. This was the first time since 2003 the Huskies recorded a sellout at the stadium.\n\nNIU plans to renovate Huskie Stadium. Following its renovation, the stadium will have a horseshoe shape, with end zone seating added to the south side of the stadium. The capacity will be raised to between 30,000 and 35,000, with the potential to expand it further to 42,000 in the future. The gymnastics and wrestling practice areas housed within the stadium will be moved to make room on the west side for a full concourse, more concessions, and more easily accessible restrooms. The east side will hold new luxury seating sections, including suites, double suites, loge box seating, a club lounge, as well as both indoor and outdoor club seats. Naming rights for the stadium might be sold after its renovation.\n\nWith a capacity somewhere between 30,000 and 35,000, the renovation will make Huskie Stadium amongst the MAC's largest in capacity. Both InfoCision Stadium (Akron) and Waldo Stadium (Western Michigan) hold 30,000; Rynearson Stadium (Eastern Michigan) holds 30,200; Kelly/Shorts Stadium (Central Michigan) holds 30,255. The only three of the venues mentioned that are in the West Division of the MAC alongside the Huskies are Waldo Stadium, Rynearson Stadium, and Kelly/Shorts Stadium, meaning that post-renovation, Huskie Stadium will quite possibly be the largest stadium in the division, if not the MAC.\n\nIn the announcement of the planned renovations, athletic director Sean Frazier commented, “We always want more seats, but we also people to fill those seats\"...\"We want something very intimate. We have a great, great facility right now. What we want to do is build off of that. When that thing is full nobody wants to play in Huskie Stadium. It is definitely a difference-maker when you’re out there.”\n\nThe renovations will be part of a $138 million overhaul to NIU's athletic facilities. As part of this overhaul, Ralph McKinzie Field, located just west of Huskie Stadium, will be replaced by a new artificial-turf baseball stadium to be built northeast of the Convocation Center and south of the Outdoor Recreation Sports Complex. A tennis facility featuring four indoor courts and locker rooms will be built to the west of the Chessick Practice Center and house NIU's tennis teams. An 'Olympic sports facility' containing practice areas for golf, gymnastics and wrestling, as well as locker rooms for multiple sports, will be built to the west of the tennis facility. The wrestling and gymnastics practice areas will replace those currently housed within Huskie Stadium. The Convocation Center will have a ring built behind the seating area to connect the lobbies on the north and south sides, allowing fans to walk from one side of the venue to the other using the concourse. Mary M. Bell Field will see an increase from 650 seats to 1,000 seats, and will also be given new restrooms, concessions and locker rooms.\n\nIn 2005, it was announced that the NIU Academic and Athletic Performance Center, a new field house and athletic training facility, would be built in the north end zone. At a press conference in conjunction with the annual NIU Spring Football Game, first-year Athletics Director Jim Phillips announced on April 23, 2005, that Huskie Intercollegiate Athletics would embark on the largest capital project in its history. Located at the north end zone, NIU began breaking ground for the new $14-million all-purpose facility in the fall of 2006, with the construction finishing the following summer and opening in August 2007.\n\nInside the Jeffrey and Kimberly Yordon Center is a football locker room with a gathering area, a strength and conditioning center (largest in the MAC), an academic support center, athletic training room with rehab pools, a 150-seat meeting room, video editing room, all ten coaches' offices, football equipment room, coaches' locker room, and computer classrooms for student-athletes.\n\nIn October 2013, NIU opened their indoor Chessick Practice Center.\n\nThe practice center features a full-size 120-yard practice field with two end zones and overrun buffer space around the field for safety. The practice room itself is , with in the adjoining Barsema Hall of Champions, and can house practice equipment for the NIU football, baseball, softball, and soccer teams.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873992", "title": "Tiger Stadium (LSU)", "text": "Tiger Stadium (LSU)\n\nTiger Stadium, popularly known as Death Valley, is an outdoor stadium located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on the campus of Louisiana State University. It is the home stadium of the LSU Tigers football team. Prior to 1924, LSU played its home games at State Field, which was located on the old LSU campus in Downtown Baton Rouge.\n\nTiger Stadium opened with a capacity of 12,000 in 1924. Renovations and expansions have brought the stadium's current capacity to 102,321, making it the third largest stadium in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), fifth largest stadium in the NCAA and the sixth largest stadium in the world.\n\nTiger Stadium is well known nationally for having among the best game day atmospheres in college football as well as being one of the most difficult places for an opposing team to play.\n\nDespite being 14–2 at Tiger Stadium, famed Alabama head coach Bear Bryant once remarked that \"Baton Rouge happens to be the worst place in the world for a visiting team. It's like being inside a drum.\" In 2001, ESPN sideline reporter Adrian Karsten said, \"Death Valley in Baton Rouge is the loudest stadium I've ever been in.\" In 2002, (Ohio) coach Terry Hoeppner said of Tiger Stadium, \"That's as exciting an environment as you can have ... we had communication problems we haven't had at Michigan and Ohio State.\" In 2003, ESPN's Chris Fowler called LSU his favorite game day experience. In 2009 former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee stated on Sean Hannity's Fox News show that \"Unfair is playing LSU on a Saturday night in Baton Rouge.\"\n\nSurvey after survey has concluded that Tiger Stadium is the most difficult place for a visiting team to play, including surveys by the College Football Association in 1987, \"The Sporting News\" in 1989, Gannett News Service in 1995, and \"Sport Magazine\" in 1998. More recently, in 2007, ESPN named Tiger Stadium \"the scariest place to play\", saying that \"Tiger Stadium is, by far, the loudest stadium in the country.\"\n\nIn 2009, ESPN writer Chris Low listed Tiger Stadium's Saturday night atmosphere as unsurpassed in the country, ranking it No. 1 out of the SE conference's 12 stadiums. In 2016, Tiger Stadium was again ranked No. 1 out of the conference's 14 stadiums by USA Today writers Laken Litman & Steven Ruiz.\n\nLSU prefers night games in Tiger Stadium with its opponents, but television coverage requires that many contests be played in the afternoons. The university is conflicted between maximizing its potential to win and needed advertising revenues from television coverage. As explained by Chet Hilburn in \"The Mystique of Tiger Stadium: 25 Greatest Games: The Ascension of LSU Football\", \"The Tigers are apt to win more games at night in Tiger Stadium but the university takes in much more revenue for a day game televised by CBS because of the Southeastern Conference contract with the network is so lucrative.\"\n\nIn 2008, as Alabama narrowly defeated LSU, Wright Thompson of ESPN.com described Tiger Stadium as \"the best place in the world to watch a sporting event.\"\n\nIn 2013, the NCAA ranked Tiger Stadium as the loudest stadium in all of college football.\n\nIn 2014, the No. 3-ranked Ole Miss Rebels played the No. 24-ranked LSU Tigers on October 25. After the Tigers held the Rebels to only 7 points in a 10–7 victory, Ole Miss quarterback Bo Wallace stated, \"It's a crazy atmosphere. This is the craziest place I've played.\"\n\nWith an official seating capacity of 102,321, Tiger Stadium is the sixth-largest stadium in the world by capacity. It is the fifth-largest stadium in the NCAA and the third-largest in the Southeastern Conference, behind Kyle Field at Texas A&M University (106,511 in 2014, 102,512 in 2015) and Neyland Stadium at Tennessee (102,455) and slightly larger than Bryant-Denny Stadium at Alabama (101,821). \n\nThe stadium opened in 1924 and originally seated 12,000—the lower half of the current facility's grandstands on the east and west sidelines. In 1931, 10,000 seats were added to the existing grandstands.\n\nIn 1936 capacity was more than doubled with 24,000 seats in the north end zone, turning the stadium into a horseshoe. Money was not allocated in the state budget for the seating expansion, but money was allocated for dormitories. According to local legend, Governor Huey P. Long, who had always taken a personal interest in LSU, ordered that dormitories be built in the stadium, with seating above the student living quarters. However, in a 2015 ESPN story, Bud Johnson, at the time director of LSU's athletics museum and also a former LSU sports information director, said that the idea actually came from LSU's athletic director T. P. \"Skipper\" Heard, while \"the governor helped in other ways.\" Until the late 1980s, the West, North and South Stadium dormitories were featured as part of student housing at LSU, and the football team even lived in them during the 1986 season while the athletic dormitory was being renovated. The dormitories were later converted to office space for Athletic Department staff and faculty and studios for the College of Art & Design's Fine Arts graduate students, but by 2015 were no longer used.\n\nMore than 21,000 seats were added in the south end zone in 1953, turning the stadium into a 67,720-seat bowl, making Tiger Stadium the largest on-campus stadium in the SEC, a distinction it would hold until Neyland Stadium expanded to 80,250 in 1976. Unlike the existing stadium structure, they were double-decked in order to fit within the space provided. The first of the two upper decks was added to the west side of the stadium in 1978 to bring capacity to approximately 78,000.\n\nThe stadium was upgraded multiple times in the 1980s beginning with replacement of bench seats with chair back seats and waterproofing of the east and west stands in 1985. The playing surface was moved to the south to center the field in 1986. The north and south ends of the stadium were waterproofed and chair back seats added in 1987 to bring those sections up to date with the 1985 improvements. Also in 1987 the press box was redecorated, a few more seats were installed at the upper portion of the west lower stands, and all seating within the stadium was renumbered using a uniform seat-width. By the end of the 1980s the stadium held 80,150 spectators.\n\nThe official capacity of the stadium was lowered to 80,000 in 1994 when a section of seating was removed for renovations to the visiting team locker room. The east upper deck seating 11,600 was completed in 2000 and brought total capacity to 91,600. The west upper deck was torn down at the end of the 2004 season, and construction began on \"The Stadium Club\". The new suites contain over 3,200 special amenity seats as well as a state-of-the-art press box. The \"Paul Manasseh Press Box\" has been named for and dedicated to the memory of the long-time and popular sports information director. Construction on this addition was scheduled to be completed by the beginning of September 2005, but delayed due to Hurricane Katrina. Construction was completed for the 2006 season, bringing the stadium's capacity to 92,400. A small number of club seats were added before the 2011 season, increasing the capacity to 92,542.\n\nDuring construction on the west side, a then-record-breaking crowd of 92,664 fans packed Tiger Stadium in a game against Auburn on October 22, 2005, as LSU defeated Auburn in overtime, 20–17. On October 6, 2007, a new record was recorded when 92,910 fans watched as the number 1-ranked Tigers defeated the number 9 Florida Gators, 28–24. A record-breaking attendance of 93,039 was again set on November 8, 2008, when number 1 Alabama defeated (16) LSU in overtime 27-21. The record was breached yet again on October 10, 2009 when the #1 ranked Florida Gators came into Tiger Stadium and defeated (4) LSU 13-3. The attendance was 93,129. The old capacity record of 93,374 was set on November 3, 2012 when (5) LSU lost to (1) Alabama 21-17, and the current record of 101,194 was set on September 13, 2014 when (10) LSU defeated Louisiana–Monroe 31-0.\n\nOn April 27, 2012, the LSU Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in favor of an $80 million south end-zone upper deck expansion that added 70 \"Tiger Den\" suites, over 3,000 club seats and 1,500+ general public seats to bring the total capacity of Tiger Stadium to 102,321, making it the fifth-largest college football stadium in the country. Construction began on October 17, 2012, and was completed by the summer of 2014. The project was privately funded by Tiger Athletic Foundation.\n\nBeginning with the 2017 football season, Tiger Stadium added the \"Skyline Club\". This open air seating located atop the south end zone upper deck is home to a 1,500 seat \"beer garden\". Purchase of a ticket in the Skyline Club includes admission to the seating area, admission to a self-serve food buffet, and the ability to purchase beer and wine. The 2018 football season saw the appearance of an additional \"beer garden\" called \"The Chute\". This new beer drinking area is located below the south endzone bleachers. It is limited to 1,500 patrons at a time. Fans entering The Chute must be at least 21 years of age, and pay a $20 admission fee that includes two complimentary beers. Additional beers must be purchased separately. The Chute has a large screen television set for watching the game, as well as a seating area consisting of tables and chairs. In 2019, alcohol sales were opened stadium wide.\nTiger Stadium first opened its gates to fans in the fall of 1924 as LSU hosted Tulane in the season finale. Since the first game in Tiger Stadium, LSU has gone on to post a 354-138-18 (.716) mark in Death Valley. Moreover, Tiger Stadium is also known for night games, an idea that was first introduced in 1931 against Spring Hill (a 35-0 LSU victory). In 2006, LSU celebrated its 75th year of playing night football in Tiger Stadium. LSU has played the majority of its games at night and the Tigers have fared much better under the lights than during the day. Since 1960, LSU is 201–59–3 (.773) at night in Tiger Stadium compared to a 21–22–3 (.488) record during the day over that span. LSU lost its first Saturday night game since 2009 against Alabama on Saturday November 3, 2012.\n\n\nIn 1974 and 1975 the NCAA Division II Grantland Rice Bowl was held in Tiger Stadium.\n\nInauguration party\n\nGovernor Edwin W. Edwards hosted a free public party at the stadium on May 9, 1972, the day of his inauguration for the first of his four terms as governor. \n\nBayou Country Superfest<br>From 2010 to 2016, Bayou Country Superfest is held each Memorial Day weekend. The concerts were moved to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in 2017 and 2018 due to renovations at Tiger Stadium.\n\nNotable concerts \n\nThe Jeff Boss Locker Room located in Tiger Stadium is and houses 126 lockers with LED lighting. It includes a state-of-the-art sound system, HDTVs, illustrative team graphics and a lighting system.<ref name=\"nola.com/The Times-Picayune\"></ref> The locker room area includes the main locker room, coaches lounge w/ lockers and a private lounge for the head coach. There is also an area dedicated to LSU's first round NFL Draft picks, a wall listing every Tiger that has been active for an NFL game, plus a list of LSU's all-time graduates. It was renovated prior to the 2014 football season and was previously renovated for the 1996 season.\n\nThe LSU Tigers football locker room in Tiger Stadium is named in honor of equipment manager, Jeff Boss. He was equipment manager for the LSU Tigers football team for 24 years from 1980 to 2003. The locker room was named after Boss on September 29, 2003.\n\nThe LSU Strength and Conditioning facility or LSU North Stadium weight room, is a strength training and conditioning facility at Louisiana State University. Built in 1997, it is located adjacent to the stadium. Measuring with a flat surface, it has 28 multi-purpose power stations, 36 assorted selectorized machines and 10 dumbbell stations along with a plyometric specific area, medicine balls, hurdles, plyometric boxes and assorted speed and agility equipment. It also features 2 treadmills, 4 stationary bikes, 2 elliptical cross trainers, a stepper and stepmill.\n\nThe facility was originally constructed to house all of LSU's sports teams, but is now home to the men's and women's basketball, gymnastics, softball, men's and women's swimming and diving, men's and women's tennis and volleyball teams. The LSU Tigers football strength training and conditioning facility is now located in the LSU Football Operations Center, where the baseball team also trains.\n\nTiger Stadium at LSU served as a temporary relocation site for the New Orleans Saints for four games of the 2005 NFL season after Hurricane Katrina damaged the Superdome and left much of New Orleans under water. The Saints, however, utilized only 79,000 of Tiger Stadium's seats (the new west side upper deck, which was still under construction, was closed for Saints games). The Saints' first two games in Baton Rouge came on the Sunday immediately following an LSU home game, meaning field crews had to repaint the field to NFL standards immediately following the completion of LSU's games, both of which kicked off at 7 p.m. Due to the time crunch, the NFL granted LSU's request to start the Saints' games in the late slot (3:05 p.m. CST). Although none of the Saints' four Baton Rouge dates sold out due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina, the NFL exempted the Saints from the league's blackout rules, and the games were televised locally by WAFB and WGMB, and in New Orleans by WWL and WVUE.\n\nThe Saints went 0-4 in Tiger Stadium. The first game saw the return of Nick Saban, who led LSU to the national championship two years earlier. Saban's Miami Dolphins defeated the Saints 21-6. The Saints subsequently lost to the Chicago Bears (20-17), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (10-3) and Carolina Panthers (27-10).\n\nTiger Stadium also hosted the Tulane Green Wave versus Southeastern Louisiana Lions football game on October 1, 2005 due to Hurricane Katrina. Tulane defeated Southeastern Louisiana 28-21.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1874011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874011", "title": "Lofa Tatupu", "text": "Lofa Tatupu\n\nMosiula Mea'alofa \"Lofa\" Tatupu (born November 15, 1982) is a former American football linebacker who played six seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He was an assistant linebackers coach with the Seattle Seahawks. He played college football for the University of Southern California (USC). Tatupu was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft.\n\nTatupu was born in San Diego, California and graduated in 2001 from King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts, where he played quarterback and linebacker in his junior and senior year. His high school coach was his father Mosi Tatupu, a fullback and special teamer who played for the New England Patriots. As a quarterback, Lofa Tatupu threw for 800 yards and 10 touchdowns and rushed for 450 yards and five touchdowns. As a linebacker, Tatupu made 100 tackles. \"The Sun Chronicle\" named Tatupu a local high school All-Star in 1999 and 2000.\n\nTatupu spent his freshman year of college at the University of Maine before transferring to the University of Southern California, where he majored in sociology and played for the USC Trojans football team. He wore the number 58, which was later worn by another USC linebacker of Samoan heritage, Rey Maualuga. Tatupu played within the player development program managed by head coach Pete Carroll and assistant head coach for defense and linebacker coach Ken Norton Jr. The USC linebacker system (\"USC Linebacker U\") has developed many NFL stars, often touted as the most talented linebacker corps in college football.\n\nTatupu started 25 games during his two years for the Trojans. He finished his USC career with 202 tackles, nine sacks, seven interceptions, three fumble recoveries, three forced fumbles, 18 pass deflections, and one touchdown. He received first-team All-American honors from \"Sports Illustrated\" following the 2004 season.\n\nTatupu was selected 45th overall in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks. Some teams had him rated lower than the second round. Seahawks general manager Tim Ruskell, who used two fourth-round picks to move up nine spots in the draft to get him, took some criticism for trading up for Tatupu, who was considered slightly undersized and a little slow. Upon joining the Seahawks Tatupu became a teammate of Matt Hasselbeck. Hasselbeck's father Don had been a teammate of Lofa's father Mosi during Mosi's career with the New England Patriots.\n\nTatupu quickly established himself as one of the top defensive players in the league as a rookie in 2005, in which he was named to the Pro Bowl, while leading the NFC Champion Seahawks in tackles, with 104, en route to their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. He also had four sacks and three interceptions, returning one for a touchdown in Seattle's 42-0 \"Monday Night Football\" victory against the Philadelphia Eagles. On December 2, 2007, he continued his success against the Philadelphia Eagles, intercepting three passes and returning them for a total of 100 yards off of Eagles' quarterback A. J. Feeley.\n\nIn Tatupu's first three seasons, he led the Seahawks in tackles. He was voted to the Pro Bowl for the first three years of his NFL career: 2005, 2006 and 2007. In 2007, Tatupu was voted to the All-Pro team by the AP. In 2008, Tatupu was hampered by nagging injuries which resulted in him playing at a lower level than he has in the past, and as a result cost him a chance to play in four consecutive Pro Bowls.\n\nTatupu emerged as the Seahawks' young and fiery leader on defense, making his teammates more attentive to preparation by watching more game tape and calling defensive signals on the field.\n\nOn March 21, 2008 the Seahawks signed Tatupu to a six-year contract extension through the year 2015. The deal was worth $42 million, with $18 million guaranteed alone in the years 2008 to 2010. The contract made Tatupu one of the six highest-paid linebackers in the league. Tatupu responded by stating, \"I'm going to end my career with the Seahawks.\"\n\nOn October 19, 2009, during a game versus the Arizona Cardinals, Tatupu tore his left pectoral muscle after a collision with teammate Deon Grant and was ruled out for the rest of the season, a huge loss to the already ailing Seahawks. This was the first major injury of Tatupu's professional career after missing only 1 game in his first 4 seasons in the NFL.\n\nAfter suffering through his worst season in 2009, Tatupu was able to play in every game for the Seahawks in 2010, including their two playoff games. Tatupu was released by Seattle on July 31, 2011, after he and the Seattle Seahawks could not come to an agreement on a re-structured contract.\n\nOn March 10, 2012, Tatupu signed a two-year, $5.75 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons. On July 24, 2012, Tatupu suffered a torn pectoral and would miss the entire 2012 NFL season. The Falcons released him the next day.\n\nThe Seahawks announced on February 9, 2015 that Tatupu would be joining Pete Carroll and new defensive coordinator Kris Richard's staff as assistant linebacker coach. He resigned from his position two years later.\n\nTatupu is of Samoan descent; he is the son of the late former USC Trojan and New England Patriots fullback Mosi Tatupu, and first cousin of Joe Tuipala former NFL linebacker. In 2019 he founded his own CBD company called ZoneIn CBD.\n\n"}

Jingmen is within an area where cotton and oil crops are planted. The population of the prefecture is 2,873,687 (2010 population census). The urban area of Jingmen City has a population of about 400,000. Jingmen is so named as in ancient times it was the gateway to Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces and means literally \"Gateway to Jingzhou\".\n\nJingmen municipality comprises two districts, two county-level cities, one county and three other non MoCA management areas:\n\nDongbao District \"downtown\" is located about 3 hours away from Wuhan by bus or rail. A new train service was introduced from Jingmen to Wuhan in 2004. Jingmen is very close to many great tourist attractions such as Changban Slope of Three Kingdoms fame, the Wudang Mountains, and the Ming Tomb in Zhongxiang (a World Heritage site only an hour away). As it is located in central China, Jingmen is within easy reach of almost anywhere in the country, taking about 18 hours to either Beijing or Guangzhou by train, or two hours by train to Yichang, home of the Gezhouba Dam project and Three Gorges Dam. From here travellers can fly to many destinations.\n\nThe Dongbao District \"downtown\" has 3 north-south parallel roads:\n\nCrisscrossing these three roads are the roads Xiangshan 1st to 3rd, so by using these main arteries it is possible to go almost anywhere in Jingmen. Xiangshan 3 road leads behind the Jingmen Foreign Language school and doesn't actually provide a direct link from Xiangshan Dadao to Changning Dadao.\n\nThe main commercial area is Zhongtian Street (formerly Jiefang (Liberty) Road), a pedestrian only street, which also crisscrosses the three main roads.\n\nJingmen is surrounded by hills within easy reach.\n\nJingmen has a typical humid subtropical climate, with January the coldest month and July the hottest month. The temperature goes up to 38 °C at noon with uncomfortable humidity in July, but also goes below 0 °C in winter, with snow every year. Rainfall is high in April to September, with less in autumn and winter.\nThe first member of the Jingmenvirus group was described in 2014 and named the Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) because it was isolated from a tick sampled in Jingmen.\n\nJingchu University of Technology (, JUT), Formerly Jingmen University) founded in early 2007, is the only university in the city of Jingmen. JUT has undergraduate programs on engineering, art, science, management, and nursing. Jingchu University of Technology is a public undergraduate institute approved by China's Ministry of Education.

Notable primary schools include Jingmen Experimental Primary School, Red Flag Primary School of Jingmen City and Daqiao (Rail Bridge) Primary School.\n\nTwo expressways go through Jingmen, the Wuhan-Jingmen-Yichang Expressway (part of G42 Shanghai-Chengdu Expressway) and the Xiangyang-Jingmen-Jingzhou Expressway (part of G55 Erenhot-Guangzhou Expressway). The Wuhan-Jingmen section has been completed by 2010. The completion halves traveling time between Wuhan and Jingmen to 2 hours. China National Highway 207 also passes through Jingmen City.\n\nJingmen is served by the Jiaozuo-Liuzhou Railway and the local Jingmen-Shashi Railway and Changjiangbu-Jingmen Railways. Traveling to Jingmen by railway is convenient, though takes time.\n\nThe economy in Jingmen consists mainly of agriculture and industry. The service sector is not as developed as manufacturing.\n\nJingmen is an important area for rice, cotton, and rapeseed production. An annual event in late March, Jingmen Rape Petal Tourism Festival, exhibits local agricultural production.\n\nThe largest industry in Jingmen is petroleum refining. The Jingmen Branch of Sinopec is a main producer of oil products in central China, refining crude oil extracted from Nanyang Oilfield in Henan province and the Jianghan Oilfield in Hubei province.\n\nJingmen is a developing logistic hub in central China. Li Ning has set up its largest distribution center in Jingmen, to link southeastern production and consumption from all over China.\n\nOther important industries include power generation, production of agricultural chemicals and cement, metal and electronic waste recycling, and beer-making.\n\nOn July 30, 2014 the mayor of Jingmen, Xiao Juhua, signed a Sister City agreement with the rural Canadian township of North Glengarry in Eastern Ontario.\n"}
{"id": "1874020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874020", "title": "Falcon Stadium", "text": "Falcon Stadium\n\nFalcon Stadium is an outdoor football stadium on the campus of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States. It is the home field of the Air Force Falcons of the Mountain West Conference, and also holds the academy's graduation ceremonies each spring.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1961, Air Force played its home games at various sites along the Front Range in Colorado. Most games were played in Denver at the University of Denver's stadium, but several were played in Colorado Springs, Pueblo, and CU's Folsom Field in Boulder.\n\nPlanned in 1955, Falcon Stadium opened in 1962, at a cost of $3.5 million, and has a current seating capacity of 46,692. The first game was on September 22, a 34–0 victory over Colorado State. It was officially dedicated four weeks later on October 20, with a ceremony which included the Thunderbirds.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force Academy lies at the base of the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains, northwest of adjacent Colorado Springs. Built into a natural bowl about two miles (3 km) southeast and below the cadet area, Falcon Stadium is approximately a mile west of Interstate 25.\n\nWith an unbalanced design and a traditional north–south alignment, the western sideline has the press box and two large grandstand tiers above the main bowl; the eastern side has a single tier, bordered by seven separate sections of grandstands.\n\nThe FieldTurf playing field is at an elevation of above sea level, the second highest in FBS college football, exceeded only by conference foe Wyoming's War Memorial Stadium in Laramie, which is higher.\n\nThe Walkup Skydome at FCS Northern Arizona in Flagstaff is also slightly higher, by .

As the stadium sits at an altitude of 7,200 feet (2195 meters) above sea level, Bill Belichick decided the elevation at Falcon Stadium was best for the Patriots to practice in preparation for the thin air in Mexico City. Same was the case for the 2018 Los Angeles Rams, however, the 2018 game was eventually cancelled because of poor field conditions at Azteca.\n\nFalcon Stadium had a natural grass field for its first 44 years, although the sideline areas where teams stood were artificial turf since the 1980s. Prior to the 2006 season, synthetic FieldTurf was installed at a cost of $750,000.\n\nThe stadium has been expanded twice, and the 2005 renovation lowered the total seating capacity. Permanent lighting was installed in Falcon Stadium in 2002 at a cost of $500,000, and the video screen at the south end of the field debuted in 2004. A new sound system was also installed for the 2006 season. The scoreboard was removed after the 2015 season, and a new, larger video board measuring tall by wide, with a total surface area of more than . At its installation in 2016, it was the largest in the Mountain West Conference and amongst the service academies. A second video board was also installed behind the northeast stands prior to the 2016 season.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, it was announced that Falcon Stadium would host the 2020 NHL Stadium Series outdoor game, with the Colorado Avalanche hosting the Los Angeles Kings.\n\n\n"}

The beach is south of San Clemente on Interstate 5 at Basilone Road. The state park is leased to the state of California by the United States Marine Corps. Governor Ronald Reagan established San Onofre State Beach in 1971. With over 2.5 million visitors per year, it is one of the five most-visited state parks in California, hosting swimmers, campers, kayakers, birders, fishermen, bicyclists, sunbathers, surfers, and the sacred Native American site of Panhe. It is named after the fourth-century saint Onuphrius.\n\nThe San Onofre Bluffs portion of San Onofre State Beach features of sandy beaches with six access trails cut into the bluff above. The campground is along the old U.S. Route 101 adjacent to the sandstone bluffs. San Onofre includes San Onofre Bluffs and Beach areas; San Onofre Surf Beach, a day-use facility; San Mateo campgrounds and day-use facility; and Trestles, accessible via a nature trail from San Mateo Campgrounds. Alcohol is banned from all beaches within the park.\n\nThe park includes a marshy area where San Mateo Creek meets the shoreline and Trestles, a surfing site. Whales, dolphins, and sea lions can be seen offshore. The park’s coastal terrace is chaparral-covered.\n\nA surfing and fishing camp had been there since the 1920s, before the U.S. government established Camp Pendleton, a U.S. Marine training camp during World War II. Surfers using redwood boards have visited San Onofre since at least the 1940s, including Lorrin \"Whitey\" Harrison, Don Okey, Al Dowden, Tom Wilson, and Bob Simmons.\n\nSan Onofre has several surf breaks on its of coast:\n\nPanhe at San Onofre is an Acjachemen village that is over 8,000 years old and a current sacred, ceremonial, cultural, and burial site for the Acjachemen people. Many Acjachemen people trace their lineage back to Panhe. It is the site of the first baptism in California, and in 1769 saw the first close contact between Spanish explorers, Catholic missionaries, and the Acjachemen people. The United Coalition to Protect Panhe and The City Project advocate for the preservation of the site. In keeping with the Padres’ tradition of naming areas after patron saints, this area was named after the obscure Egyptian, St. Onuphrius.\n\nOn November 10, 2016, the Transportation Corridor Agency abandoned plans to build a six-lane toll highway through San Onofre State Beach, other nearby sensitive environmental areas, and certain Native American cultural sites. The announcement brings to an end more than 10 years of effort to build through these areas. The abandonment of this route for the toll road was part of an agreement ending several lawsuits filed by the California attorney general and a coalition of environmental groups that sought to block the project.\n\nNudity is prohibited at all parts of San Onofre State Beach, A traditional \"clothing optional area\" was formerly at the extreme south end of San Onofre Bluffs beach, accessed via Trail number 6.

{"id": "1874032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874032", "title": "Kenan Memorial Stadium", "text": "Kenan Memorial Stadium\n\nKenan Memorial Stadium is located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and is the home field of the North Carolina Tar Heels. It is primarily used for football. The stadium opened in 1927 and holds 50,500 people. It is located near the center of campus at the University of North Carolina.\n\nThe previous home of the Tar Heels was Emerson Field, which opened in 1916 on the current site of Davis Library. By 1925, it was obvious that that 2,400-seat facility was not adequate for the increasing crowds. Expansion was quickly ruled out since the baseball team also used it. Any new football seats would have also been too far away for baseball.\n\nFunding for the stadium was originally supposed to come from alumni donations. William R. Kenan, Jr., a UNC alumni, scientist, industrialist and dairy farmer from Lockport, New York who would later become a prominent businessman in Miami, got word of the initial plans and donated a large gift to build the stadium and an adjoining field house. Kenan was an 1894 UNC graduate and grandson of one of UNC's original trustees. Kenan persuaded UNC to build the stadium as a memorial to his parents, William R. Kenan and Mary Hargrave Kenan.\n\nGround was broken in November 1926. The stadium was completed in August 1927. At the time, it was located on the far southern portion of campus, but expansions over the years have resulted in the stadium now being near the center of campus. The stadium officially opened on November 24, 1927. The Tar Heels defeated Davidson College 27-0, with the first touchdown in the new stadium by Edison Foard. The first game at Kenan Stadium brought in 9,000 spectators. It was officially dedicated to the Kenan family on Thanksgiving Day in 1927 in front of 28,000 fans, after the Tar Heels beat the Virginia Cavaliers 14-13.\nThe original stadium—the lower level of the current stadium's sideline seats—seated 24,000 people. However, temporary bleachers were added to the end zones to accommodate overflow crowds, allowing Kenan to accommodate over 40,000 people at times. This happened fairly often over the years, especially during the Choo Choo Justice era of the late 1940s.\n\nThe largest crowd to see a game at Kenan—and the largest to see a game on-campus in the state of North Carolina—was a standing-room-only throng of 62,000 when the Tar Heels hosted the Florida State Seminoles in 1997. The largest paid crowd was a crowd of 62,000 that saw the Tar Heels face Duke in 2013. The 1991 season opener versus Cincinnati and the Clemson game, which was televised nationally by ESPN, were UNC's first true night home games in school history.\n\nThe Tar Heels football team sold out every game from 1992 to 1999, and also sold out all but one game of Butch Davis's tenure. Most of the west end zone and three sections of the south stands are reserved for students. The student section of the west end zone is popularly known as the \"Tar Pit\"—a name applied to the entire stadium during the late 1990s.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010, fireworks were shot from atop Kenan Field House whenever the Tar Heels took the field, as well as after every score and win. They were removed in 2011, but reinstated in 2012 after Larry Fedora's arrival, and for the next three seasons were shot off behind the west end zone.\n\nWilliam R. Kenan, to whom the stadium was dedicated since its construction in 1927, \"was the commander of a white supremacist paramilitary force, which massacred scores of black residents in Wilmington, on a single day in 1898.\" In 2018 the University decided to remove the plaque on the stadium mentioning him, and to designate the stadium as named for his son William R. Kenan Jr.\n\nThe stadium was first expanded in 1963, when Kenan (who died in 1965) donated $1 million to double-deck the sideline seats and add permanent bleachers to the end zones, expanding capacity to 48,000. A seating adjustment in 1979 boosted capacity to 50,000. In 1988, the old press box and chancellor's box were replaced by 2,000 seats between the 40-yard lines, expanding capacity to 52,000.\n\nPart of the 1987-88 project were a permanent lighting system, a chancellor's lounge on the north side of the field and a football lettermen's lounge on the south side. The lights are part of a General Electric low-mount system which minimizes the height of the lightpoles. Cost of the entire project was $7 million. It was funded by private gifts and bonds.\n\nThe stadium's biggest renovation project to date took place from 1995 to 1998. Head coach Mack Brown wanted a better facility to showcase a resurgent football program, which had gone from consecutive 1-10 seasons in 1988 and 1989 to a run of success not approached since the 1940s. The stadium was lacking in many areas. For instance, Kenan was one of the few Division I stadiums not to have permanent seating in at least one end zone; the only end zone seats at the time were the portable bleachers added in 1963. Also, the locker rooms were somewhat cramped by 1990s standards.\n\nSeveral generous gifts resulted in the addition of a new playing field and a brand-new facility for the football team, the Frank H. Kenan Football Center, named for the great-grandson of the stadium's original benefactor. The Kenan Center included a memorabilia section showcasing the football program's history. The most visible addition, however, was 8,000 new seats in the west end zone, which turned the stadium into a horseshoe. Also added was a \"preferred seating box\" atop the north stands. Due to state law, only 6,000 of the new end zone seats were available in 1997. Capacity dropped to 48,500 in 1996, but leaped to 57,800 in 1997. The other 2,200 seats were added in 1998, bringing the stadium to a capacity of 60,000, not eclipsed until the 2011 season. In 2003, a modern scoreboard with video capability was added in front of Kenan Field House. The next addition came before the 2007 season, when the old matrix boards on the sidelines were replaced with ribbon boards.\nIn December 2006, the Chapel Hill Town Council approved changes to UNC's development plan that included at least 8,800 additional seats for Kenan Stadium.\n\nIn October 2007, athletic director Dick Baddour announced plans for extensive renovations to Kenan Stadium. Plans called for a new academic support center in place of Kenan Field House, plus anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000 additional seats. The new seats would be added in the east end zone, turning the stadium into a bowl. Plans would have to be approved by the chancellor and the board of trustees, and would almost certainly require a fundraising effort by the Rams Club. No specific timetable was set, but Baddour said that he hoped to begin construction within 18 months.\n\nThis \"masterplan\" was divided into two phases; phase one covering the west end zone and two covering the east end zone. The first phase consisted of adding a fifth floor (for recruiting and media space) along with remodeling the existing offices and team spaces in the Kenan Football Center. Approved on July 23, 2008, by the Board of Trustees for $50 million, Phase I renovations were completed on August for the 2009 Football Season.\n\nA third and final phase of the project was also planned. This includes new club-level seats around the perimeter of the stadium, a new suite level above the club seats, a much larger press box, and a brick facade encircling the outside of the stadium. Construction of this phase has not been scheduled, however, due to budgetary constraints.\n\nOn May 27, 2010, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Board of Trustees approved the immediate commencement on construction of the \"Carolina Student-Athlete Center for Excellence\", a $70 million expansion that would replace Kenan Field House. The entire project was funded by private donations and the selling of club seats and individual suites. This facility would be a combination of an academic center, \"Carolina Leadership Academy\", Olympic sports' strength and conditioning center, and visitor lockers within a span of two floors.\n\nHowever, the most significantly visible portion of the renovation was the addition of 2,980 seats. The additional seats in the end zone, named the Blue Zone, would be \"1,836 seats in the Concourse Club just a few feet from the field, 824 seats in the Upper Club/Loge on the fourth floor and 320 seats in 20 suites on the fifth floor\". The individual suites, each of which has 16 seats, will sell for $50,000 per year. Each seat in the club levels range from $750 to $2,500 per season. Furthermore, the construction of a new concourse in front of the Carolina Student-Athlete Center for Excellence would allow fans to move around the entire perimeter of Kenan Stadium for the first time. The exterior of the new section is similar in appearance to the Bell Tower.\n\nThe 2011 renovation and expansion fully enclosed the stadium for the first time in its history. This facility houses the Loudermilk Center for Student Excellence as well as 3,000 additional premium club, suite seating and lounge areas in the east end zone, bringing total stadium capacity to 63,000. As part of this addition, HD video boards were installed on each end of the stadium. In 2016, new ribbon boards and updated concessions were added. In 2018, the metal bleachers that had been in place for almost half a century were replaced with individual seats, reducing capacity to 50,500. The stadium switched the playing surface from natural grass to a RootZone synthetic grass surface manufactured by AstroTurf for the 2019 season. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1874050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874050", "title": "Coming of Age in Samoa", "text": "Coming of Age in Samoa\n\nComing of Age in Samoa is a book by American anthropologist Margaret Mead based upon her research and study of youth – primarily adolescent girls – on the island of Ta'u in the Samoan Islands. The book details the sexual life of teenagers in Samoan society in the early 20th century, and theorizes that culture has a leading influence on psychosexual development.\n\nFirst published in 1928, the book launched Mead as a pioneering researcher and as the most famous anthropologist in the world. Since its first publication, \"Coming of Age in Samoa\" was the most widely read book in the field of anthropology until Napoleon Chagnon's \"Yanomamö: The Fierce People\" overtook it. The book has sparked years of ongoing and intense debate and controversy on questions pertaining to society, culture, and science. It is a key text in the nature versus nurture debate, as well as in discussions on issues relating to family, adolescence, gender, social norms, and attitudes.\n\nIn the 1980s, Derek Freeman contested many of Mead's claims, and argued that she was hoaxed into counterfactually believing that Samoan culture had more relaxed sexual norms than Western culture. However, the anthropology community on the whole has rejected Freeman's claims, concluding that Freeman cherry-picked his data, and misrepresented both Mead's research and the interviews that he conducted.\n\nIn the foreword to \"Coming of Age in Samoa\", Mead's advisor, Franz Boas, writes:\n\"Courtesy, modesty, good manners, conformity to definite ethical standards are universal, but what constitutes courtesy, modesty, good manners, and definite ethical standards is not universal. It is instructive to know that standards differ in the most unexpected ways.\"\nBoas went on to point out that, at the time of publication, many Americans had begun to discuss the problems faced by young people (particularly women) as they pass through adolescence as \"unavoidable periods of adjustment\". Boas felt that a study of the problems faced by adolescents in another culture would be illuminating.\n\nMead introduces the book with a general discussion of the problems facing adolescents in modern society and the various approaches to understanding these problems: religion, philosophy, educational theory, and psychology. She discusses various limitations in each approach and then introduces the new field of anthropology as a promising alternative science based on analyzing social structures and dynamics. She contrasts the methodology of the anthropologist with other scientific studies of behavior and the obvious reasons that controlled experiments are so much more difficult for anthropology than other sciences. For this reason her methodology is one of studying societies in their natural environment. Rather than select a culture that is fairly well understood such as Europe or America, she chooses South Sea island people because their culture is radically different from Western culture and likely to yield more useful data as a result. However, in doing so she introduces new complexity in that she must first understand and communicate to her readers the nature of South Sea culture itself rather than delve directly into issues of adolescence as she could in a more familiar culture. Once she has an understanding of Samoan culture she will delve into the specifics of how adolescent education and socialization are carried out in Samoan culture and contrast it with Western culture.\n\nMead described the goal of her research as follows:\"I have tried to answer the question which sent me to Samoa: Are the disturbances which vex our adolescents due to the nature of adolescence itself or to the civilization? Under different conditions does adolescence present a different picture?\"\n\nTo answer this question, she conducted her study among a small group of Samoans. She found a village of 600 people on the island of Ta'ū, in which, over a period of between six and nine months, she got to know, lived with, observed, and interviewed (having learnt some Samoan) 68 young women between the ages of 9 and 20. Mead studied daily living, education, social structures and dynamics, rituals, etiquette, etc.\n\nMead begins with the description of a typical idyllic day in Samoa. She then describes child education, starting with the birth of children, which is celebrated with a lengthy ritual feast. After birth, however, Mead describes how children are mostly ignored, for girl children sometimes explicitly ritually ignored, after birth up to puberty. She describes the various methods of disciplining children. Most involve some sort of corporal punishment, such as hitting with hands, palm fronds, or shells. However, the punishment is mostly ritualistic and not meant to inflict serious harm. Children are expected to contribute meaningful work from a very early age. Initially, young children of both sexes help to care for infants. As the children grow older, however, the education of the boys shifts to fishing, while the girls focus more on child care. However, the concept of age for the Samoans is not the same as in the West. Samoans do not keep track of birth days, and they judge maturity not on actual number of years alive, but rather on the outward physical changes in the child. As a child gets bigger and stronger, he or she gets more work and responsibility.\n\nMead describes some specific skills the children must learn related to weaving and fishing, and then almost casually interjects the first description of Samoan sexuality, saying that in addition to work for adolescent girls: \"All of her [additional] interest is expended on clandestine sex adventures.\" This comes directly after a passage where Mead describes how a reputation for laziness can make an adolescent girl a poor candidate for marriage, implying that for Samoans a work ethic is a more important criterion for marriage than virginity.\n\nMale adolescents undergo various kinds of both encouragement and punishment to make them competitive and aggressive. Males have many different possible jobs (e.g., \"a house builder, a fisherman, an orator, a wood carver\") in the community. Status is also a balance between prowess and achievement and appearing humble. Also, \"social prestige is increased by his amorous exploits\".\n\nFor the adolescent girls, status is primarily a question of whom they will marry. Mead also describes adolescence and the time before marriage as the high point of a Samoan girl's life: \"But the seventeen year old girl does not wish to marry – not yet. It is better to live as a girl with no responsibility, and a rich variety of experience. This is the best period of her life.\"\n\nThe next section describes the structure of a Samoan village: \"a Samoan village is made up of some thirty to forty households, each of which is presided over by a head man\". Each household is an extended family including widows and widowers. The household shares houses communally: each household has several houses but no members have ownership or permanent residence of any specific building. The houses may not all be within the same part of the village.\n\nThe head man of the household has ultimate authority over the group. Mead describes how the extended family provides security and safety for Samoan children. Children are likely to be near relatives no matter where they are, and any child that is missing will be found quite rapidly. The household also provides freedom for children including girls. According to Mead, if a girl is unhappy with the particular relatives she happens to live with, she can always simply move to a different home within the same household. Mead also describes the various and fairly complex status relations which are a combination of factors such as role in the household, the household's status within the village, the age of the individual, etc. There are also many rules of etiquette for requesting and granting favors.\n\nMead describes the many group structures and dynamics within Samoan culture. The forming of groups is an important part of Samoan life from early childhood when young children form groups for play and mischief. There are several different kinds of possible group structures in Samoan culture. Relations flow down from chiefs and heads of households; men designate another man to be their aid and surrogate in courting rituals; men form groups for fishing and other work activities; women form groups based on tasks such as child caring and household relations. Mead describes examples of such groups and describes the complex rules that govern how they are formed and how they function. Her emphasis is on Samoan adolescent girls, but as elsewhere she needs to also describe Samoan social structures for the entire culture to give a complete picture.\n\nMead believes that the complex and mandatory rules that govern these various groups mean that the traditional Western concept of friendship as a bond entered into voluntarily by two people with compatible interests is all but meaningless for Samoan girls: \"friendship is so patterned as to be meaningless. I once asked a young married woman if a neighbor with whom she was always upon the most uncertain and irritated terms was a friend of hers. 'Why, of course, her mother's father's father, and my father's mother's father were brothers.\n\nThe ritual requirements (such as being able to remember specifics about family relations and roles) are far greater for men than women. This also translates into significantly more responsibility being put on men than women: \"a man who commits adultery with a chief's wife was beaten and banished, sometime even drowned by the outraged community, but the woman was only cast out by her husband\".\n\nMead devotes a whole chapter to Samoan music and the role of dancing and singing in Samoan culture. She views these as significant because they violate the norms of what Samoans define as good behavior in all other activities and provide a unique outlet for Samoans to express their individuality. According to Mead there is normally no greater social failing than demonstrating an excess of pride, or as the Samoans describe it, \"presuming above one's age\". However, this is not the case when it comes to singing and dancing. In these activities, individuality and creativity are the most highly praised attributes, and children are free to express themselves to the fullest extent of their capabilities rather than being concerned with appropriate behavior based on age and status:\n\nMead describes the psychology of the individual Samoan as being simpler, more honest, and less driven by sexual neuroses than the west. She describes Samoans as being much more comfortable with issues such as menstruation and more casual about non-monogamous sexual relations. Part of the reason for this is the extended family structure of Samoan villages. Conflicts that might result in arguments or breaks within a traditional Western family can be defused in Samoan families simply by having one of the parties to the conflict relocate to a different home that is part of the household within the village. Another reason Mead cites is that Samoans do not seem eager to give judgmental answers to questions. Mead describes how one of the things that made her research difficult was that Samoans would often answer just about every question with non-committal answers, the Samoan equivalent to shrugging one's shoulders and saying: \"Who knows?\"\nMead concludes the section of the book dealing with Samoan life with a description of Samoan old age. Samoan women in old age \"are usually more of a power within the household than the old men. The men rule partly by the authority conferred by their titles, but their wives and sisters rule by force of personality and knowledge of human nature.\"\n\nMead concluded that the passage from childhood to adulthood (adolescence) in Samoa was a smooth transition and not marked by the emotional or psychological distress, anxiety, or confusion seen in the United States.\n\nMead concluded that this was due to the Samoan girl's belonging to a stable, monocultural society, surrounded by role models, and where nothing concerning the basic human facts of copulation, birth, bodily functions, or death, was hidden. The Samoan girl was not pressured to choose from among a variety of conflicting values, as was the American girl. Mead commented, somewhat satirically:... [an American] girl's father may be a Presbyterian, an imperialist, a vegetarian, a teetotaller, with a strong literary preference for Edmund Burke, a believer in the open shop and a high tariff, who believes that women's place is in the home, that young girls should wear corsets, not roll their stockings, not smoke, nor go riding with young men in the evening. But her mother's father may be a Low Episcopalian, a believer in high living, a strong advocate of States' Rights and the Monroe Doctrine, who reads Rabelais, likes to go to musical shows and horse races. Her aunt is an agnostic, an ardent advocate of women's rights, an internationalist who rests all her hopes on Esperanto, is devoted to Bernard Shaw, and spends her spare time in campaigns of anti-vivisection. Her elder brother, whom she admires exceedingly, has just spent two years at Oxford. He is an Anglo-Catholic, an enthusiast concerning all things medieval, writes mystical poetry, reads Chesterton, and means to devote his life to seeking for the lost secret of medieval stained glass. Her mother's younger brother ...\n\nOn publication, the book generated a great deal of coverage both in the academic world and in the popular press. Mead's publisher (William Morrow) had lined up many endorsements from well known academics such as anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski and psychologist John Watson. Their praise was a major public relations coup for Morrow and drew popular attention to the book. Academic interest was soon followed by sensational headlines such as \"Samoa is the Place for Women\" and that Samoa is \"Where Neuroses Cease\".\n\nFor most anthropologists before Mead, detailed immersive fieldwork was not a common practice. Although subsequent reviews of her work have revealed faults by the standards of modern anthropology, at the time the book was published the idea of living with native people was fairly ground breaking. The use of cross-cultural comparison to highlight issues within Western society was highly influential and contributed greatly to the heightened awareness of anthropology and ethnographic study in the United States. It established Mead as a substantial figure in American anthropology, a position she would maintain for the next fifty years.\n\nAs Boas and Mead expected, this book upset many Westerners when it first appeared in 1928. Many American readers felt shocked by her observation that young Samoan women deferred marriage for many years while enjoying casual sex before eventually choosing a husband. As a landmark study regarding sexual mores, the book was highly controversial and frequently came under attack on ideological grounds. For example, the \"National Catholic Register\" argued that Mead’s findings were merely a projection of her own sexual beliefs and reflected her desire to eliminate restrictions on her own sexuality. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute listed \"Coming of Age in Samoa\" as #1 on its list of the \"50 Worst Books of the Twentieth Century\".\n\nAlthough \"Coming of Age\" received significant interest and praise from the academic community, Mead's research methodology also came in for criticism from several reviewers and fellow anthropologists. Mead was criticized for not separating her personal speculation and opinions from her ethnographic description of Samoan life and for making sweeping generalizations based on a relatively short period of study.\n\nFor example, Nels Anderson wrote about the book: \"If it is science, the book is somewhat of a disappointment. It lacks a documental base. It is given too much to interpretation instead of description. Dr. Mead forgets too often that that she is an anthropologist and gets her own personality involved with her materials.\"\n\nShortly after Mead’s death, Derek Freeman published a book, \"Margaret Mead and Samoa\", that claimed Mead failed to apply the scientific method and that her assertions were unsupported. This criticism is dealt with in detail in the section below.\n\nIn 1983, five years after Mead had died, Derek Freeman – a New Zealand anthropologist who lived in Samoa – published \"Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth\", in which he challenged all of Mead's major findings. In 1988, he participated in the filming of \"Margaret Mead in Samoa\", directed by Frank Heimans, which claims to document one of Mead's original informants, now an elderly woman, swearing that the information she and her friend provided Mead when they were teenagers was false; one of the girls would say of Mead on videotape years later:\n\nAnother of Mead's statements on which Freeman focused was her claim that through the use of chicken blood, Samoan girls could and do lie about their status of virginity. Freeman pointed out that virginity of the bride is so crucial to the status of Samoan men that they have a specific ritual in which the bride's hymen is manually ruptured in public, by the groom himself or by the chief, making deception via chicken blood impossible. On this ground, Freeman argued that Mead must have based her account on (false) hearsay from non-Samoan sources.\n\nThe argument hinged on the place of the \"taupou\" system in Samoan society. According to Mead, the \"taupou\" system is one of institutionalized virginity for young women of high rank, and it is exclusive to women of high rank. According to Freeman, all Samoan women emulated the \"taupou\" system, and Mead's informants denied having engaged in casual sex as young women and claimed that they had lied to Mead.\n\nAfter an initial flurry of discussion, many anthropologists concluded that Freeman systematically misrepresented Mead's views on the relationship between nature and nurture, as well as the data on Samoan culture. According to Freeman's colleague Robin Fox, Freeman \"seemed to have a special place in hell reserved for Margaret Mead, for reasons not at all clear at that time\".\n\nMoreover, many field and comparative studies by anthropologists have since found that adolescence is not experienced in the same way in all societies. Systematic cross-cultural study of adolescence by Schlegel and Barry, for example, concluded that adolescents experience harmonious relations with their families in most non-industrialized societies around the world.\n\nThey find that, when family members need each other throughout their lives, independence, as expressed in adolescent rebelliousness, is minimal and counterproductive. Adolescents are likely to be rebellious only in industrialized societies practicing neolocal residence patterns (in which young adults must move their residence away from their parents). Neolocal residence patterns result from young adults living in industrial societies who move to take new jobs or in similar geographically mobile populations. Thus, Mead's analysis of adolescent conflict is upheld in the comparative literature on societies worldwide.\n\nFirst, these critics have speculated that he waited until Mead died before publishing his critique so that she would not be able to respond. However, in 1978, Freeman sent a revised manuscript to Mead, but she was ill and died a few months later without responding.\n\nSecond, Freeman's critics point out that, by the time he arrived on the scene, Mead's original informants were old women, grandmothers, and had converted to Christianity, so their testimony to him may not have been accurate. They further argue that Samoan culture had changed considerably in the decades following Mead's original research; after intense missionary activity, many Samoans had come to adopt the same sexual standards as the Americans who were once so shocked by Mead's book. They suggested that such women, in this new context, were unlikely to speak frankly about their adolescent behavior. Further, they suggested that these women might not be as forthright and honest about their sexuality when speaking to an elderly man as they would have been speaking to a woman near their own age.\n\nSome anthropologists criticized Freeman on methodological and empirical grounds. For example, they stated that Freeman had conflated publicly articulated ideals with behavioral norms – that is, while many Samoan women would admit in public that it is ideal to remain a virgin, in practice they engaged in high levels of premarital sex and boasted about their sexual affairs among themselves. Freeman's own data documented the existence of premarital sexual activity in Samoa. In a western Samoan village, he documented that 20% of 15 year-olds, 30% of 16 year-olds, and 40% of 17 year-olds had engaged in premarital sex. In 1983, the American Anthropological Association held a special session to discuss Freeman's book, to which they did not invite him. Their criticism was made formal at the 82nd annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association the next month in Chicago, where a special session, to which Freeman was not invited, was held to discuss his book. They passed a motion declaring Freeman's \"Margaret Mead and Samoa\" \"poorly written, unscientific, irresponsible, and misleading\". Freeman commented that \"to seek to dispose of a major scientific issue by a show of hands is a striking demonstration of the way in which belief can come to dominate the thinking of scholars\".\n\nIn the years that followed, anthropologists vigorously debated these issues. Two scholars who published on the issue include Appell, who stated \"I found Freeman's argument to be completely convincing\"; and Brady, who stated \"Freeman's book discovers little but tends to reinforce what many anthropologists already suspected\" regarding the adequacy of Mead's ethnography. They were supported by several others.\n\nMuch like Mead's work, Freeman's account has been challenged as being ideologically driven to support his own theoretical viewpoint (sociobiology and interactionism), as well as assigning Mead a high degree of gullibility and bias. Freeman's refutation of Samoan sexual mores has been challenged, in turn, as being based on public declarations of sexual morality, virginity, and \"taupou\" rather than on actual sexual practices within Samoan society during the period of Mead's research.\n\nLowell Holmes – who completed a lesser-publicized re-study – commented later: \"Mead was better able to identify with, and therefore establish rapport with, adolescents and young adults on issues of sexuality than either I (at age 29, married with a wife and child) or Freeman, ten years my senior.\"\n\nIn 1996, Martin Orans published his review of Mead's notes preserved at the Library of Congress, crediting her for leaving all her recorded data as available to the general public. Orans concludes that Freeman's basic criticism (that Mead was duped by ceremonial virgin Fa'apua'a Fa'amu who later swore to Freeman that she had played a joke on Mead) was false for several reasons: first, Mead was well aware of the forms and frequency of Samoan joking; second, she provided a careful account of the sexual restrictions on ceremonial virgins that corresponds to Fa'apua'a Fa'amu's account to Freeman; and third, that Mead's notes make clear that she had reached her conclusions about Samoan sexuality before meeting Fa'apua'a Fa'amu. He therefore concludes, contrary to Freeman, that Mead was never the victim of a hoax.\n\nOrans points out that Mead's data supports several different conclusions, and that Mead's conclusions hinge on an interpretive, rather than positivist, approach to culture. Orans concludes that due to Mead's interpretive approach – common to most contemporary cultural anthropology – her hypotheses and conclusions are essentially unfalsifiable and therefore \"not even wrong\".\n\nIn 1998, Freeman published another book \"The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead\". It included new material, in particular interviews that Freeman called of \"exceptional historical significance\" and \"of quite fundamental importance\" of one of Mead's then-adolescent informants by a Samoan chief from the National University of Samoa (in 1988 and 1993) and of her daughter (in 1995). Correspondence of 1925–1926 between Franz Boas and Margaret Mead was also newly available to Freeman. He concludes in the introduction to the book that \"her exciting revelations about sexual behavior were in some cases merely the extrapolations of whispered intimacies, whereas those of greatest consequence were the results of a prankish hoax\".\n\nFreeman argues that Mead collected other evidence that contradicts her own conclusion, such as a tutor who related that as of puberty girls were always escorted by female family members. He also claims that because of a decision to take ethnological trips to Fitiuta, only eight weeks remained for her primary research into adolescent girls, and it was now \"practically impossible\" to find time with the sixty-six girls she was to study, because the government school had reopened. With the remaining time, she instead went to Ofu, and the bulk of her research came from speaking with her two Samoan female companions, Fa'apua'a and Fofoa. Freeman claims Mead's letters to Boas reflect that she was influenced by studies of sexuality from Marquesas Islands, and that she was seeking to confirm the same information by questioning Fa'apua'a and Fofoa. She sent her conclusions to Boas on March 14 and with \"little left to do\" she cut short her trip.\n\nFreeman claimed that \"no systematic, firsthand investigation of the sexual behavior of her sample of adolescent girls was ever to be undertaken. Instead, Margaret Mead's account of adolescent sexual behavior in \"Coming of Age in Samoa\" and elsewhere was based on what she had been told by Fa'apua'a and Fofoa, supplemented by other such inquiries that she had previously made.\" As Fa'apua'a told Freeman, in her 80s, that she and her friend had been joking, Freeman defends her testimony in the introduction of his second book about Mead: Both that the octagenarian's memory was very good, and that she swore on the Bible, as a Christian, that it was true.\n\nIn 2009, a detailed review of the controversy was published by Paul Shankman. It supports the contention that Mead's research was essentially correct, and concludes that Freeman cherry-picked his data and misrepresented both Mead and Samoan culture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1874074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874074", "title": "County Lock", "text": "County Lock\n\nCounty Lock is a lock on the River Kennet in Reading town centre in the English county of Berkshire. It is now administered by the Canal & River Trust as part of the Kennet and Avon Canal. Downstream from the lock is Brewery Gut, a particularly fast flowing, narrow and dangerous stretch of the river.\n\nCounty Lock has the lowest rise of the locks on the Kennet, as boats only rise or fall about 30 cm (1 foot) in the lock. The main stream of the Kennet flows down the weir on the far side of the lock, while another arm of the Kennet disappears under the Bridge Street Roundabout.\n\nThe first County Lock was built between 1718 and 1723, during the navigation works undertaken under the supervision of the engineer John Hore of Newbury in order to create the Kennet Navigation between Reading and Newbury. Initially the lock was located on the north side of the river, adjacent to Bear Wharf, but it was relocated to its current location on the south bank as part of the Reading waterworks improvement scheme of 1876.\n\nThe land on both sides of the river adjacent to County Lock was formerly part of the site of Simonds' Brewery. Brewery Gut takes its name from the brewery. In the days of horse haulage, this stretch of river had no towpath, and a long tow line had to be sent down-river on a specially designed float. To add to the difficulty, at its narrowest the gut is only wide, causing strong currents. Multiple vessels cannot safely pass due to the tortuous and narrow route, and there have been instances in the past of boats colliding and sinking. Today passage through the gut is controlled by traffic lights.\n\nSimonds' Brewery closed in the late 1970s, and most of the brewery buildings have been demolished. Around the lock itself they have been replaced by a mixture of apartments and offices, although the brewery's old stable building, which overlooks the lock, has been preserved and was formerly occupied by a Loch Fyne restaurant. The part of the brewery that enveloped \"Brewery Gut\" has been replaced by The Oracle shopping centre, and boats can be seen navigating through the middle of the \"Riverside Level\" of that complex, lined on both sides by restaurants and pubs.\n\n"}
{"id": "1874076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874076", "title": "Kibbie Dome", "text": "Kibbie Dome\n\nThe William H. Kibbie-ASUI Activity Center (commonly known as the Kibbie Dome) is a multi-purpose indoor athletic stadium in the northwest United States, on the campus of the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. It is the home of the Idaho Vandals and is used for intercollegiate competition in five sports: football, basketball, tennis, indoor track and field, and soccer.\n\nThe Kibbie Dome opened as an outdoor concrete football stadium in October 1971, built on the same site of the demolished wooden Neale Stadium (1937–68), seen in this early 1950s photo. Following the 1974 football season, a barrel-arched roof and vertical end walls were added in ten months and the stadium re-opened as an enclosed facility in September 1975.\n\nWith just 16,000 permanent seats, it was the second smallest home stadium for college football in Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A), but Idaho football has rejoined the FCS and is a member of the Big Sky Conference. Since February the Kibbie Dome has been reconfigured for basketball games and is referred to as the Cowan Spectrum, seating 7,000. The elevation of the playing surface is above \n\nThe stadium was built in stages and took several years to complete. Originally, the new football stadium was to be outdoors and seat over 23,000 spectators, with an adjacent 10,000-seat indoor arena for basketball. The Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA), known since 1988 as the Big West Conference, had been launched in 1969 and Idaho was attempting to join, but political wrangling in the state legislature and subsequent budget cuts caused a change in the scope of the stadium project. This ensured that Idaho could not make the move to the PCAA; the Vandals remained in the Big Sky Conference with the other state schools, Idaho State and new member Boise State. Idaho eventually joined the Big West in 1996.\n\nThe revised plan was for a smaller capacity football stadium, to be enclosed to allow use as a basketball arena (and indoor track and tennis as well). This multi-purpose concept had been recently used at Idaho State in Pocatello, where Holt Arena had opened as the Minidome in 1970.\nConstruction on the concrete grandstands started in February 1971, after a fire destroyed the previously condemned wooden Neale Stadium in November 1969. The stadium, which opened in 1937, had been condemned in August 1969 due to soil erosion beneath the grandstands. The Vandal football team played its limited home schedule for the next two seasons at WSU's Rogers Field in Pullman.\n\nAfter a fire significantly damaged Rogers Field's south grandstand in April 1970, WSU moved all of its 1970 and 1971 home games to Joe Albi Stadium in Spokane, but the Vandals remained at Rogers in Pullman for four \"home\" games in 1970. The Vandals' game with WSU on September 19 in Spokane was dubbed the A lopsided for the Cougars, it was WSU's only victory in a stretch of 22 games.\n\nBack in Moscow, weather-related construction delays in the spring put the new \"Idaho Stadium\" a month behind The Vandals played their first two \"home\" games in 1971 well away from campus, in Boise for the opener and Spokane two weeks later. Uncompleted, the stadium debuted on October 9 with a victory over Idaho State first football game on campus in nearly The Vandals went in 1971, which included a school-record eight-game winning streak, and won the Big Sky title. For its first four seasons the stadium was outdoors and In the summer of 1972, a Tartan Turf field was installed over a asphalt with a roll-up mechanism behind the west end zone; the one-piece field was the first in the world. In November 1974, approval was finally granted by the board of regents to enclose and vertical end walls were completed in time for the 1975 season's home opener on September 27, a deflating to Idaho State in front \n\nThe enclosed stadium was renamed that year for William H. Kibbie, a construction executive from Salt Lake City and a primary benefactor of the project; he contributed $300,000 in 1974 to initiate the funding drive. Bill Kibbie (1918–1988), originally of Bellevue in Blaine County, was a UI student for less than a month in 1936 when he withdrew due to his He entered the construction business, then served as a B-24 pilot in World War II, and eventually founded JELCO in 1957, later EMKO, a major contracting company in Utah. The acronym \"ASUI\" is for the \"Associated Students of the University of Idaho,\" the student government.\n\nWhen the university announced it would enclose its football stadium, the fledgling Trus-Joist Company of Boise bid on and won the project. While steel and aluminum were the products of the day for domes and large unsupported buildings, Trus-Joist saw the UI stadium as a chance to demonstrate the strength, durability, and economy of their engineered wood products. From the final design to the end of construction, the enclosure project took just ten months and $1 million to complete. In 1976, the Kibbie Dome roof won the \"Structural Engineering Achievement Award\" from the American Society of Civil Engineers. TJ International, the successor to Trus-Joist, was acquired by Weyerhaeuser \n\nFollowing the first indoor football season, the asphalt base underneath the field was covered with Tartan polyurethane in January 1976. The first basketball game was played on January 21, and the inaugural Vandal Invitational indoor track meet was held three days later.\n\nThe Kibbie Dome's roof spans from sideline-to-sideline, and its maximum height is above the hashmarks. (Holt Arena, completed in 1970 on the campus of Idaho State University in Pocatello, has an opposite geometry: its arched roof spans the \"length\" of the football field, rather than its width, resulting in a very low roof at the end lines and goal posts.)\n\nSoon after completion in 1975, problems arose with the roof's exterior. The outer surface of Hypalon and underlying polyurethane foam were improperly applied and a second attempt to seal the roof with Diathon in the late 1970s did not succeed. Leaks were occurring and wood rot was a potential problem by 1980. An infrared scan of the roof in the spring of 1981 showed that half of it was moist and the insulating foam was in poor condition. Various stopgap measures were taken to stop the leaks in 1981. After an extended period of finger-pointing and threatened legal action, an out-of-court settlement was reached. A new superstructure with a composite roof was built over the original. Completed in the fall of 1982, coinciding with the completion of the East End Addition, the second roof shielded the first and solved the problem.\n\nThe Kibbie Dome officially seats 16,000 for football. By the end of Idaho's tenure in Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A) in the 2017 season, it was the second-smallest FBS venue. A record crowd of 19,878 was recorded for the eighth consecutive rivalry game victory over Boise State in November 1989, during the schools' I-AA Big Sky era. The football field runs an unorthodox east–west, but even with the new translucent upper end walls (2009 and 2011), sun location is not a major visibility issue.\n\nFor two and a half seasons, 1999 to 2001, the Vandals used WSU's Martin Stadium in nearby Pullman as its home field, as Idaho transitioned back to Division I-A from Division I-AA. When Dennis Erickson returned as head coach in 2006, there was talk of adding a second deck to the Kibbie Dome to increase the football seating to 25,000, and building a new basketball arena. In February 2007, the state board of education appropriated funds to study expansion possibilities. On December 6, the board approved funding to begin design work for $52 million in improvements, including an expansion to 20,000 seats, lowering the elevation of the playing field, and other various safety and spectator improvements. However, the capacity was ultimately never expanded beyond its nominal 16,000.\n\nWhen not used for football, the former AstroTurf football field was rolled up in about an hour to reveal of polyurethane tartan surface, used for indoor tennis and track & field. The five-lane track is in length, and 9 tennis courts are lined on its infield. Basketball and volleyball courts are also lined on the tartan infield. The AstroTurf was spooled onto a large field-width reel at the base of the west wall.\n\nIn 1990, the original synthetic turf (3M Tartan Turf) of 1972 was replaced after 18 seasons, which included three years outdoors. At this time, the goal posts were modified and attached to the walls, eliminating the center support post. In the summer of 2007, the Kibbie Dome's AstroTurf was replaced with RealGrass Pro, a next-generation infilled synthetic turf similar to Field Turf. Unlike the carpet-like AstroTurf, the infilled synthetic turf is not easily rolled up in a continuous reel, and must be removed in sections. The turf sections are in width, running from sideline to sideline, attached to each other with velcro. Other stadiums with RealGrass Pro include Texas Stadium (the former home of the Dallas Cowboys), and the Alamodome in San Antonio.\n\nLife and safety upgrades to the Kibbie Dome began in the spring of 2009. The west wall was replaced with a non-combustible construction assembly; translucent plastic panels on the upper half and opaque metal siding on the lower. Concurrent with the end-wall replacement, a range of interior life safety work took place: field level exiting in the new west wall, addition of handrails in the seating aisles, provision of the required smoke exhaust systems; and other life safety and code mitigation improvements. The second phase of the project was completed in 2011 with the replacement of the east wall. A premium seating area (Litehouse Center) was established in 2011 in the former press box area above the south grandstand; a new press box was constructed above the north grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has also served as the home of the Vandal basketball teams, providing increased seating capacity over the venerable Memorial Gym (built in 1928), a block to the east. The basketball court is positioned at midfield on the south sideline, in front of the press box and the south grandstand, with temporary seating on the north, east, and west. The first basketball game was played against WSU on January 21, 1976, commemorated with an alumni game which included Vandal great The main court was originally smooth tartan rubber, poured directly onto the pavement floor, resulting in a very hard and unforgiving surface, but resulted in a tremendous home court advantage under head coach Don Monson in the early 1980s. After nine seasons, it was replaced with a conventional hardwood floor in the fall of 1984, acquired from the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nDuring basketball games, the converted Kibbie Dome is now referred to as the Cowan Spectrum, named for Bob and Jan Cowan, who financed the current configuration. Since February the new basketball layout has been separated from the rest of the stadium by massive black curtains to give the court a more intimate \"stadium-within-a-stadium\" feel, with a reduced seating capacity of 7,000. Temporary OES scoreboards are placed over the north and south stands during games. (video)\n\nDuring the early 1980s, with Don Monson as head coach, the Kibbie Dome was considered one of the 20 toughest home courts in college basketball by \"Sports Illustrated.\" Additional temporary seating was gradually increased on the north basketball sideline (center of the football field) and attendance exceeded 11,000 for several games during the 1982–83 season. From January 1980 to February 1983, the Vandals won 43 consecutive home games, and Monson's home record in his final four seasons was 51–2 (). A Big Sky record attendance of 11,800 witnessed the streak end against Montana.\n\nThe venue hosted three Big Sky Conference men's basketball tournaments (by winning the regular season title), in 1981, 1982, and 1993. (The Vandals departed the Big Sky for the Big West in 1996, then to the WAC in 2005 before returning its non-football sports to the Big Sky in 2014, and football in 2018.)\n\nIdaho is now preparing to build the new Idaho Central Credit Union Arena, north of the Kibbie Dome, to house men's and women's basketball, plus women's volleyball. The 4,200-seat venue is currently scheduled to open in time for volleyball in the fall of 2021.\n\nSince its enclosure in 1975, the Kibbie Dome has undergone several significant additions. The East End Addition was completed in the fall of 1982, providing the entire athletic department with locker rooms, offices, a weight room, athletic training facility, and equipment room. The formal dedication and open house for the $3.9 million addition was held in late October. Until the addition, the football and basketball teams, both Vandals and visitors, dressed in the Memorial Gym and made the lengthy walk (or run) west to the Kibbie Dome, often in rain or snow. This had been the practice for UI football for over 40 years, since the opening of Neale Stadium in 1937. Bill Kibbie also made a significant donation for this project in 1979.\n\nIn April 2004, the facilities were again enhanced with the addition of the Vandal Athletic Center, designed by Opsis Architecture, home to the Norm and Becky Iverson Speed and Strength Center; the renovation of the men's and women's basketball, football, and volleyball locker rooms, and the addition of a state-of-the-art hydrotherapy pool (ARC).\n\nAugust 2005 saw the installation of infilled SprinTurf on the former natural grass practice field east of the Kibbie Dome. The days of \"off-limits\" were eliminated, as UI students acquired state-of-the-art playing fields available for year-round use. A field that previously had just 300 usable hours annually as an \"intercollegiate athletics only\" field (primarily for natural turf varsity football practice), is now available for up to 2,000 hours per year. The project was funded through the Kibbie Dome turf replacement fund; the $1.2 million SprinTurf project included lighting and fencing.\n\nThe two fields are adequate for team practice for football (and soccer, lacrosse, rugby, and other sports) as well as for intramural competition, but short enough to have two fields in the space available. Each field is a full half-field (with end zone & goal post) plus an additional beyond the 50-yard line. An unmarked median separates the two fields; the total length, with end zones, is and runs north–south. The former natural turf fields were lined as a regulation football field running north–south, with a half field at the north end running east–west. An added benefit of the synthetic surface is an estimated $50,000 annual savings in field maintenance costs.\n\nOn the west side of the Kibbie Dome is the Dan O'Brien outdoor track & field stadium, which hosted its first meet in 1972, and was renamed in 1996 for the Olympic gold medalist world champion and former world record holder in the decathlon. A concrete grandstand at the finish area (southeast corner) has a seating capacity of 1,000. The first all-weather surface lasted less than a decade and was replaced in 1980. The facility underwent a major renovation in 2011 to host the 2012 WAC outdoor championships. South of the Dome is the university's 18-hole golf course, a challenging track due to its rolling Palouse terrain. A par-72 course with terraced fairways and significant changes in elevation, its back tees measure , with a course rating of 72.4, and a 135 slope rating. The course opened in 1937 with nine holes, then expanded from 1968–70, with the present clubhouse opening in 1969. To the east is the Memorial Gymnasium (1928), the swim center and the physical education building (both 1970), and six outdoor tennis courts. Four additional tennis courts are on the east side of campus, at the southeast corner of the Administration Lawn.\n\nAbout a half mile north (800 m) of the Dome are expansive natural grass intramural fields, west of the Wallace dormitories. Included here is the women's soccer field, in the far northwest corner bounded by Perimeter Road. Towards the center is Guy Wicks Field, the baseball field since the late 1960s. (Baseball was dropped as a varsity sport after the 1980 season, after more than 80 seasons, but continues as a club sport.)\n\n\n\n\n"}

This mill was supplied with bar iron from Sowley Forge in Hampshire; both sites were operated by Charles Pocock Sr., Thomas Golden and Charles Pocock Jr.\n\nIn 1850, a pumping station was built on the north side of the canal. The station was used to pump water to the Bath Road Reservoir in Reading to cater for the town's population expansion and provided the town its first filtered water supply.

An ATN can, theoretically, analyze the structure of any sentence, however complicated. ATN are modified transition networks and an extension of RTNs.\n\nATNs build on the idea of using finite state machines (Markov model) to parse sentences. W. A. Woods in \"Transition Network Grammars for Natural Language Analysis\" claims that by adding a recursive mechanism to a finite state model, parsing can be achieved much more efficiently. Instead of building an automaton for a particular sentence, a collection of transition graphs are built. A grammatically correct sentence is parsed by reaching a final state in any state graph. Transitions between these graphs are simply subroutine calls from one state to any initial state on any graph in the network. A sentence is determined to be grammatically correct if a final state is reached by the last word in the sentence.\n\nThis model meets many of the goals set forth by the nature of language in that it captures the regularities of the language. That is, if there is a process that operates in a number of environments, the grammar should encapsulate the process in a single structure. Such encapsulation not only simplifies the grammar, but has the added bonus of efficiency of operation. Another advantage of such a model is the ability to postpone decisions. Many grammars use guessing when an ambiguity comes up. This means that not enough is yet known about the sentence. By the use of recursion, ATNs solve this inefficiency by postponing decisions until more is known about a sentence.\n\n\n\n"}

The character primarily appears in the \"MC2\" future of the Marvel Universe. He was created by Tom DeFalco and Pat Olliffe and first appeared in \"Spider-Girl\" #2. (November 1998)\n\nReilly Tyne is the son of Ben Reilly (Spider-Man's clone) and Elizabeth Tyne. Before he reached his teens, his inherited powers began to manifest but brought with them clonal degeneration. Kaine, the degenerated first clone of Peter Parker, found him, and placed him within a regeneration tank to slow the process. Kaine's efforts were for two goals: to resurrect Daredevil, who had previously died saving Kaine, and to heal Tyne. Kaine summoned the demon Zarathos, which attempted to possess Tyne, but he was saved by the soul of Daredevil, who drove out Zarathos, although both Daredevil's soul and a piece of the demon remained within Tyne, and he was left with a demonic appearance and certain demonic abilities. Through meditation and concentration, Tyne eventually learned to project a human appearance, but he now looked to be in his twenties, almost twice his actual age. Following in both of Daredevil's paths, he studied law and became an attorney, while taking on a costume bearing a resemblance to Daredevil's and using his demonic abilities to fight crime as Darkdevil. He apparently has access to at least some of Daredevil's memories, since he knows Spider-Man's secret identity.\n\nDarkdevil has fought alongside Spider-Girl several times, as well as the semi-retired Spider-Man. Neither Spider-Man nor Spider-Girl are aware of his genetic relation to them, but Darkdevil has hinted that he owes his existence to the original Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Kaine. Mary Jane noticed Reilly at Normie Osborn and Brenda Drago's wedding party and attempted to point out to her husband the boy that resembled him. Peter Parker cluelessly mentions that Reilly resembles Tobey Maguire, a sly nod by writers to the fact that Maguire played Spider-Man in three films.\n\nWhen Doc Magus, Sorcerer Supreme (successor to Doctor Strange), delved into Darkdevil's mind, he found it had three inhabitants: Reilly himself as a young teen, Daredevil, and Zarathos in the form of Ghost Rider.\n\nRecently he has been seen working alongside Kaine, going as far as to refer to the man as Uncle Kaine, thus confirming that he is fully aware of his relation to both Kaine, Spider-Girl and her father Peter Parker. During a clone debacle which resulted in there being two May Parkers (one being a symbiote hybrid), Darkdevil assists Spider-Girl in her rescue attempt only to be confronted by the Goblin Queen and the clone Spider-Girl.\n\nDarkdevil possesses augmented levels of strength, speed, agility and reflexes, along with the ability to cling to solid surfaces. He also possesses an ability similar to Spider-Man’s spider-sense which allows him to detect immediate danger to himself. Due to his connection with the demon Zarathos, who is imprisoned in his body, he can also teleport, change his appearance from demon to human, manifest flaming constructs, such as billy clubs, and the ability to turn any part of his body into flame. Darkdevil is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and free style fighter, due to his link to the original Daredevil's soul. In his civilian guise as Reily Tyne, he is also a skilled and respected lawyer, much like Daredevil's alter-ego: Matt Murdock.\n\n\n"}

It is now home to the Schaumburg Boomers of the Frontier League which began play in May 2012 and captured the first-ever professional baseball championship for Schaumburg in 2013. It is primarily used for baseball, and was the home field of the Schaumburg Flyers baseball team from 1999 through 2010 before the Boomers resurrected the facility for pro baseball in 2012.\n\nSchaumburg Boomers Stadium opened in 1999 and the park holds 7,365 people for a baseball game or over 10,000 for a concert or other non-baseball event. Its field dimensions mimic those of Chicago's Wrigley Field, and the land the stadium is built on was originally purchased in the mid-1980s as a hopeful site for the New Wrigley Field, had the City of Chicago and the Chicago Cubs not come to terms to bring night baseball to the North Side. Some pro lacrosse as well as professional and amateur softball has also been played at Schaumburg Boomers Stadium due to the late start (mid-May) of the independent baseball season.\n\nThe Stadium itself is located west of I-355 off the Elgin-O'Hare Expressway. Now called Schaumburg Boomers Stadium, the Alexian Brothers Medical Center in nearby Elk Grove purchased the naming rights to the ballpark in 2000. The Stadium was host to the Schaumburg Flyers from its opening through the end of the 2010 season. At that point, the village and park district which owned the stadium began eviction proceedings against the Flyers for failure to pay $551,800 in back rent. On February 24, 2011, a Cook County court ruled the Flyers could be evicted, ordered the now defunct team to pay the back rent, and the naming rights contract was terminated when there was no professional baseball played in the park in 2011.\n\nFrom 2009-10, the Wheaton College Thunder, a Division III baseball program, played its home games at Schaumburg Boomers Stadium, and since 2008 the Dominican University Stars another Division III baseball program has played a majority of it home games at Schaumburg Boomers Stadium. In 2011, the Roosevelt Lakers, an NAIA baseball program, played its home games at the stadium as well.\n\nLater that year, in September 2011, Chicago attorney Patrick A. Salvi was awarded ownership of a Frontier League franchise that began play in May 2012. Salvi is also the owner of the American Association's Gary SouthShore RailCats. The franchise is known as the Schaumburg Boomers named after the \"booming dance\" of the male Greater Prairie Chicken and the team earned a 54-42 record during its Inaugural Season, falling one win short of a playoff berth.\n\nIn just the franchise's second season in 2013, the Schaumburg Boomers captured the first-ever pro baseball championship for the Village of Schaumburg in impressive fashion. After capturing the league's best record in the regular season (59-37), the Boomers became the first team in the Frontier League's 14-year history to sweep through the playoffs with a 6-0 record en route to claiming the 2013 Frontier League Championship. In doing so, the Boomers made good on a promise to win title in the \"first 100 years or your money back.\" The guarantee was featured on a billboard announcing the new team in March 2012 before the club's first season got underway.\n\n"}
{"id": "1874154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874154", "title": "Slipcasting", "text": "Slipcasting\n\nSlipcasting or slip casting is a ceramic forming technique for the mass-production of pottery and other ceramics, especially for shapes not easily made on a wheel. Slipcast ware should not be confused with slipware, which is pottery formed by any technique that is decorated using slip. In slipcasting, a liquid clay body slip (usually mixed in a blunger) is poured into plaster moulds and allowed to form a layer, the cast, on the inside walls of the mould.\n\nIn a solid cast mould, ceramic objects such as handles and plates are surrounded by plaster on all sides with a reservoir for slip, and are removed when the solid piece is held within. For a hollow cast mould, for objects such as vases and cups, once the plaster has absorbed most of the liquid from the outside layer of clay the remaining slip is poured off for later use. After a period for further absorption of water, the cast piece is removed from the mould once it is leather-hard, that is, firm enough to handle without losing its shape. It is then \"fettled\" (trimmed neatly) and allowed to dry out further, usually overnight or for several hours. This produces a \"greenware\" piece which is then ready to be decorated, glazed and fired in a kiln.\n\nThe technique is suited to the production of complex shapes, especially if with relief decoration and thin walls. Much modern fine factory porcelain is made by the technique, very often the entire production. It is also commonly used for sanitaryware, such as toilets and basins, and smaller pieces like figurines and teapots. The technique can also be used for small-scale production runs or to produce limited edition, one off objects, especially reproductions of antique dolls and modern porcelain doll-making.\n\nAn additive with deflocculant properties, such as sodium silicate, can be added to the slip to disperse the raw material particles. This allows a higher solid content to be used, or allows a fluid slip to be produced with a minimum of water so that drying shrinkage is minimised, which is important during slipcasting.\n\nThe French for slip is barbotine (\"Coulée en barbotine\" is slipcasting), and \"barbotine pottery\" is sometimes used for 19th century French and American pottery with added slipcast decoration, as well as (confusingly) being the English term for a variety of slipware that is decorated with thick blobs of slip.\n\n"}
{"id": "1874163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874163", "title": "USAT Buford", "text": "USAT Buford\n\nUSAT \"Buford was a combination cargo/passenger ship, originally launched in 1890 as the SS \"Mississippi. She was purchased by the US Army in 1898 for transport duty in the Spanish–American War. In 1919, she was briefly transferred to the US Navy, commissioned as the USS \"Buford\" (ID 3818), to repatriate troops home after World War I, and then later that year returned to the Army.\n\nIn December 1919, nicknamed the \"Soviet Ark\" (or the \"Red Ark\") by the press of the day, the Buford was used by the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Labor to deport 249 non-citizens to Russia from the United States because of their alleged anarchist or syndicalist political beliefs.\n\nShe was sold to private interests in 1923, contracted in mid-1924 to be the set for Buster Keaton's silent film \"The Navigator\", and finally scrapped in 1929.\n\nThe ship began life as the SS \"Mississippi\", constructed by Harland & Wolff of Belfast, Ireland for Bernard N. Baker of Baltimore and the Atlantic Transport Line. While under de facto American ownership, she would fly the British flag, due to the economies of the navigation laws of the period. The \"Mississippi\" was launched on August 29, 1890 and began her maiden voyage, from London, on October 28, 1890. In command was her first captain, Hamilton Murrell, \"Hero of the \"Danmark\" Disaster,\" who a year earlier had saved 735 lives from the sinking Danish passenger ship \"Danmark\", the largest single rescue at the time.\n\nFor the first year of her career, the \"Mississippi\" plied the waters between London, Swansea, Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n\nIn January 1892, the \"Mississippi\" was moved to the London-New York route, where she remained until she was purchased by the U.S. Army Quartermaster Department as part of a seven-ship deal on June 24, 1898, and became an army transport ship, serving in the Caribbean theater of the Spanish–American War. The \"Mississippi\" was assigned the number \"25\" on July 5, 1898. However, she sailed under her given name until March 2, 1899, the following year, when she was officially renamed the USAT \"Buford\", in honor of Gen. John T. Buford, the Union cavalry officer and hero of the Battle of Gettysburg of the American Civil War.\n\nOn May 28, 1900, the \"Buford\" entered the naval yards of the Newport News Ship-Building Company for a major refitting as a troop-ship for service between the United States and the Philippines. Two of her original four masts were removed; the other two were replaced with long masts. While under conversion, the \"Buford\" would miss the peak of the Boxer Rebellion. Once back in service in November of that year, the \"Buford\" took up regular service on the Pacific run from San Francisco to Honolulu and Guam terminating in Manila, and returning via Nagasaki and Honolulu.\n\nAt 5:12 a.m. on Wednesday, April 18, 1906, the \"Buford\" was in San Francisco when the Great Quake of 1906 struck. She was taken from the pier into the bay to avoid the resultant fire and was one of three transports - \"Buford\", \"Crook\" and \"Warren\" - used in the harbor as temporary storehouses for the supplies coming into the stricken city by sea in the weeks following the disaster.\n\nIn September 1906, the \"Buford\" was sent to rescue over 600 passengers and crew from the SS \"Mongolia\", which had pierced her hull after running aground at Midway Island. Before \"Buford\" arrived on the scene, the \"Mongolia's\" crew had freed her. However, the two ship captains determined it prudent to send the passengers back on \"Buford\". To ensure the safe arrival of \"Mongolia\"'s crew, should the passenger steamer's bilge pumps fail to keep pace with the leaks, the \"Buford\" escorted her during the five-day return to Hawaii.\n\nIn 1907 and 1911, the \"Buford\" was involved in famine relief missions to China. In 1912–1916, she was involved in refugee and troop missions during the Mexican Revolution. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the \"Buford\" continued her refugee rescue work, bringing away Americans who wished to flee the European fighting. She supported the American war effort once the U.S. entered the conflict.\n\nThe \"Buford\" was in Galveston harbor when a massive hurricane hit on August 17, 1915 and was the city's sole line of communication to the outside world through her radio.\n\nIn December 1918, the \"Buford\" underwent another refit to prepare her for transporting American Expeditionary Force troops home from the war.\n\nThe \"Buford\"s most notorious incarnation followed a few months later when she was pressed into service as the \"Soviet Ark\" (or \"Red Ark\"). On December 21, 1919, she was used to deport 249 political radicals and other \"undesirable\" aliens, mostly members of the Union of Russian Workers, to the Russian SFSR. Also swept up were the fiery anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. This occurred between the first and second Palmer Raids of the first \"Red Scare\" period in the U.S. After delivering her charges, the \"Buford\" returned to New York on February 22, 1920.\n\nDuring the First Red Scare in 1919-20 following the Russian Revolution, anti-Bolshevik sentiment quickly replaced the anti-German sentiment of the World War I years. Many politicians and government officials, along with a large part of the press and the public, feared an imminent attempt to overthrow the government of the United States and the creation of a new regime modeled on that of the Soviets. In that atmosphere of public hysteria, radical views as well as moderate dissents were often characterized as un-American or subversive, including the advocacy of labor rights and any less than complementary discussion of American society and its system of government. Close ties between recent European immigrants and radical political ideas and organizations fed those anxieties as well.\n\nThe Espionage Act of 1917 made it a crime to interfere with the operation or success of the armed forces of the United States. It effectively criminalized any act or speech that discouraged full compliance with the military draft. Convicted under this law, Eugene V. Debs, a five-time presidential candidate, served 3 years of a 10-year sentence before President Warren G. Harding commuted his sentence on Christmas Day, 1921. Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were likewise convicted under the Espionage Act and eventually deported. The Immigration Act of 1918 denied entry into the U.S. and permitted the deportation of non-citizens \"who disbelieve in or are opposed to all organized government.\"\n\nThe \"Buford\" steamed out of New York harbor at 6 A. M. on Sunday, December 21, 1919, with 249 \"undesirables\" on board. Of those, 199 had been seized in the November 7 Palmer Raids. Some were leftists or anarchists, though perhaps as many as 180 were deported because of their membership in the Union of Russian Workers, an anarchist organization which served social and educational functions for many Russian immigrants, had been the principal target of the raids. Other deportees, including the well-known radical leaders Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, had been detained earlier. All, by act or speech or membership in an organization, fell within the legal definition of anarchist under the Immigration Act of 1918, which did not distinguish between \"malignant conspirators and destructive revolutionists\" on the one hand or \"apostles of peace, preachers of the principle of non-resistance\" on the other. All met the law's requirement in that they \"believed that no government would be better for human society than any kind of government.\" Goldman had been convicted in 1893 of \"inciting to riot\" and in 1917 for interfering with military recruitment. She had been arrested on many other occasions. Berkman had served 14 years in prison for the attempted assassination of industrialist Henry Clay Frick after the Homestead Steel Strike in 1892. In 1917 he had been convicted alongside Goldman for the same anti-draft activities. The notoriety of Goldman and Berkman as convicted agitators allowed the press and public to imagine that all the deportees had similar backgrounds. The \"New York Times\" called them all \"Russian Reds.\"\n\nNot all the deportees were unhappy to be leaving the United States. Most were single, few were being separated from their families, and some anticipated a brighter future in the new Soviet Russia.\n\nTwenty-four hours after its departure, the \"Buford\"'s captain opened sealed orders to learn his projected destination. The captain only learned his final destination while in Kiel harbor while awaiting repairs and taking on a German pilot to guide the ship through the North Sea minefields, uncleared despite Germany's surrender a year earlier. The State Department had found it difficult to make arrangements to land in Latvia as originally planned. Though finally chosen, Finland was not an obvious choice, since Finland and Russia were then at war.\n\nF.W. Berkshire, Supervising Inspector of Immigration, made the journey to oversee the enterprise and, in contrast to his two most famous charges, reported little conflict. A \"strong detachment of marines\" numbering 58 enlisted men and four officers also made the journey and pistols had been distributed to the crew.\n\nIn \"\"My Disillusionment in Russia\",\" Emma Goldman wrote of the \"Buford\" voyage:\n\nAlexander Berkman, in \"\"The Russian Tragedy\",\" added,\n\nOn the evening of 9 January 1920, she arrived at Kiel and was docked for repairs. “It was not known how long the vessel will remain there, but her ultimate destination was reported to be either Libau or Riga.”\n\nThe \"Buford\" reached Hanko, Finland at 4:25 pm on Friday, January 16, 1920. The prisoners were kept between decks until they were landed the next day, Saturday, January 17, 1920, at 2 pm. They were taken off the transport and marched between a cordon of American marines and Finnish White Guards to a special train that was to take them to Terijoki, Finland, about two miles from the frontier. The 249 \"undesirable aliens\" were placed, 30 to a car, in [unheated] box cars fitted up with plank benches, tables and beds. Each car contained seven boxes of army rations. The supplies include bully-beef, sugar and hard bread.\n\nFinnish White Guards were stationed on each car platform. The party was to be completely isolated until it reached its destination. Once loaded, the train was then held overnight while rumors of the party being killed as they crossed the border caused a diplomatic flurry.\n\nThe journey began the next day, January 18, but the exiles were sidetracked at Viborg, Finland, remaining confined in their cars, while awaiting the British Prisoners' Relief Mission, which was to cross the Russian frontier at the same time. Delayed by storms, the \"Buford\" began her return voyage that same day.\n\nOn January 19, the trek continued to Terijoki. Once the deportees had arrived, and after trudging through a heavy snowstorm, a parlay was conducted under white flags of truce between Berkman, guarded by the Finns, and the Russians, out on the ice of the frozen Systerbak River, which separated the Finnish and Bolshevist lines. Things being settled, the \"undesirables\" then crossed over into Russia at 2 pm, Berkman and Goldman waiting until everyone else had safely crossed. All were enthusiastically received with cheers and a band playing the Russian national anthem. In the war-wrecked town of Bielo-Ostrov, which overlooked the stream, they boarded a waiting train which took them to Petrograd.\n\nMost of the press approved enthusiastically of the \"Buford\" experiment. The Cleveland \"Plain Dealer\" wrote: \"It is hoped and expected that other vessels, larger, more commodious, carrying similar cargoes, will follow in her wake.\"\n\nOn August 5, 1920, the \"Buford\" returned the ashes of Puerto Rican patriot Dr. Ramon Emerterio Betances to San Juan.\n\nOn May 2, 1921, once again in the Pacific, the \"Buford\" rescued sixty-five passengers and crew from the inferno of the Japanese steam freighter \"Tokuyo Maru\", which had caught fire and burned 60 miles southwest of the mouth of the Columbia River, off Tillamook Head, Oregon.\n\nIn mid 1922, as one of her final duties as a U. S. transport, the \"Buford\" conducted an inspection tour of Northwestern and Alaska Army posts and closed a number of posts in the territory abandoned by the War Department.\n\nIn early 1923, the \"Buford\" was sold to John C. Ogden and Fred Linderman of the San Francisco-based Alaskan Siberian Navigation Company. On July 20, the fledgeling company steamed the \"Buford\" north with a delegation from the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce on board to explore the business opportunities of the Alaskan and Siberian markets. On their outward bound stop in Seattle, a young, out of work, 25 year-old reporter joined the party, first as a passenger, then as part of the crew to earn his passage. His name was Elwyn Brooks White, later to become better known as E. B. White, an editor at The New Yorker and author of the children’s classic Charlotte’s Web.\n\nIn 1924, after a voyage to the South Seas, the \"Buford\" was chartered for three months by silent film comedian Buster Keaton for use as the principal set of his film \"The Navigator\". The \"Buford\" had been \"discovered\" by Keaton's Technical Director Fred Gabourie while scouting for ships for another, outside project, \"The Sea Hawk\". Released on October 13, 1924, \"The Navigator\" proved to be Keaton's most financially successful film and one of his personal favorites. After this moment in the limelight, the \"Buford\" slipped into dormancy and would occasionally reappear at the center of several financially dubious schemes.\n\nOn February 25, 1929, it was reported that the \"Buford\" would be scrapped in Yokohama, Japan by Hasegawa Gentaro. She sailed from Los Angeles on May 11, 1929, flying the American flag under the command of Capt. A. G. Laur to meet her final fate.\n\n"}

The expression formula_11 represents the maximum number of possible codewords in a formula_12-ary block code of length formula_2 and minimum distance formula_4.\n\nThen the Singleton bound states that\n\nFirst observe that the number of formula_12-ary words of length formula_2 is formula_18, since each letter in such a word may take one of formula_12 different values, independently of the remaining letters.\n\nNow let formula_1 be an arbitrary formula_12-ary block code of minimum distance formula_4. Clearly, all codewords formula_23 are distinct. If we puncture the code by deleting the first formula_24 letters of each codeword, then all resulting codewords must still be pairwise different, since all of the original codewords in formula_1 have Hamming distance at least formula_4 from each other. Thus the size of the altered code is the same as the original code.\n\nThe newly obtained codewords each have length\n\nand thus, there can be at most formula_28 of them. Since formula_1 was arbitrary, this bound must hold for the largest possible code with these parameters, thus:\n\nIf formula_1 is a linear code with block length formula_2, dimension formula_33 and minimum distance formula_4 over the finite field with formula_12 elements, then the maximum number of codewords is formula_36 and the Singleton bound implies:\nso that\nwhich is usually written as\n\nIn the linear code case a different proof of the Singleton bound can be obtained by observing that rank of the parity check matrix is formula_40. Another simple proof follows from observing that the rows of any generator matrix in standard form have weight at most formula_41.\n\nThe usual citation given for this result is , but according to the result can be found in a 1953 paper of Komamiya.\n\nLinear block codes that achieve equality in the Singleton bound are called MDS (maximum distance separable) codes. Examples of such codes include codes that have only two codewords (the all-zero word and the all-one word, having thus minimum distance formula_2), codes that use the whole of formula_43 (minimum distance 1), codes with a single parity symbol (minimum distance 2) and their dual codes. These are often called \"trivial\" MDS codes.\n\nIn the case of binary alphabets, only trivial MDS codes exist.\n\nExamples of non-trivial MDS codes include Reed-Solomon codes and their extended versions.\n\nMDS codes are an important class of block codes since, for a fixed formula_2 and formula_33, they have the greatest error correcting and detecting capabilities. There are several ways to characterize MDS codes:\n\nThe last of these characterizations permits, by using the MacWilliams identities, an explicit formula for the complete weight distribution of an MDS code.\n\nThe linear independence of the columns of a generator matrix of an MDS code permits a construction of MDS codes from objects in finite projective geometry. Let formula_66 be the finite projective space of (geometric) dimension formula_67 over the finite field formula_48. Let formula_69 be a set of points in this projective space represented with homogeneous coordinates.

He went on to become a professional fighter and worked in Japan. Cash met up with Ricky Morton during his travels, and took Cash on the road with him and continued his training. Working as a welder by day, Cash wrestled on the independent circuit. Under the name David Tyler Morton Jericho he formed a short lived tag team with Ricky Morton.\n\nKash started wrestling at age 20 in 1989.\n\nCash's first mainstream exposure came in late November 1996 with ECW. Cash, then wrestling as David Tyler Morton Jericho, went to Philadelphia with friend and sometimes tag team partner \"Heavy Metal\" Ric Savage. Cash was friends with New Jack of the Gangstas and Rob Van Dam, and it was Rob Van Dam who first introduced Cash to Paul Heyman. Cash shortly left ECW back to the indies and even wrestled house shows for WWF. He also appeared once at TV tapings, using ring name David Jericho, on April 28, 1998 at \"WWF Shotgun Saturday Night\" where he was defeated by Taka Michinoku. During a WWF house show against the tag team Too Cool, Cash broke both of his ankles after performing a botched hurricanrana on Scotty 2 Hotty.\n\nThe injury sidelined Cash for a while but upon his return to the ring he resurfaced in ECW in late 1999 under a new gimmick, Kid Kash. The name change was due to his uncanny resemblance to musician Kid Rock. Under this name, Kash would dress like Kid Rock from his \"Devil Without a Cause\" album, and even used the song (and named one of his finishers, The Bawitaba) during this phase in his career. Just months after his return Kash suffered a broken jaw in Atlanta at the hands of The Dupps. He had legitimate heat with the tag team for their supposed stiff and shoot moves on Kash during matches and as payback during a planned run in during Kash's match Bo Dupp did an unplanned frog splash right on Kash's face, breaking both sides of his jaw. At the time Atlanta was going through a flu epidemic and so Kash had to get a private physician to fix his jaw because the hospitals were swamped. Despite the injury Kash continued to wrestle, and never took a night off. He even wrestled on the Guilty as Charged PPV the very next night after driving from Atlanta to Birmingham, AL, less than 24 hours after his jaw was wired shut. This earned him the respect of Paul Heyman and several other ECW wrestlers. Kash recovered from the injury without any problems and went on to wrestle tag matches, cruiserweight-style matches, and even wrestled Mike Awesome for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Living Dangerously on March 12, 2000, although he lost after he was superbombed from the top rope through a Table. His tag team partners during the time include the likes of Rob Van Dam, Super Crazy, Nova and The Sandman. Kash won the ECW World Television Championship and defeating Rhino on August 26, 2000. A few weeks later, Rhino would reclaim the title from Kash. On October 1 at Anarchy Rulz, Kash pinned EZ Money in a singles match. At November to Remember, Kash defeat C. W. Anderson. On December 3 at Massacre on 34th Street, he and Super Crazy were defeated by The Unholy Alliance (Yoshihiro Tajiri and Mikey Whipwreck) in a tag team match. At Guilty as Charged, he and Super Crazy and F.B.I. (Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke) were both defeated by The Unholy Alliance in a three way dance tag team match. After Guilty as Charged, the promotion went defunct in 2001.\n\nTwo months later after ECW folded Kash was signed with World Championship Wrestling where they billed him as Cash. His only match was on the final episode of \"Thunder\", airing on March 21, where he lost to Jason Jett. That same week, WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nOn August 14, 2002, Kash re-emerged in TNA Wrestling as part of the X Division. Using the gimmick of a cocky, obnoxious heel (while still maintaining a degree of his Kid Rock mannerisms), Kash won the TNA X Division Championship from Sonny Siaki on February 12, 2003 and lost the title to Amazing Red on April 30. Some of the more notable feuds Kid Kash developed in TNA were against James Storm, Dusty Rhodes, Jeff Hardy, A.J. Styles, and even a few intergender matches with Trinity.
