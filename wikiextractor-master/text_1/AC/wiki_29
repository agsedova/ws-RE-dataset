It has both expensive and large detached properties as well as more modest town houses built in a variety of architectural styles. The area is popular with expatriates working in the emirate and is familiar to many tourists visiting Dubai.\n\nArchaeological excavations at Jumeirah Archaeological Site,<ref name=\"Emirates24/7 01-2020\"></ref> which was discovered in 1969, demonstrate that the area was inhabited as far back as the Abbasid era, approximately in the 10th century CE. At this time, it appears to have been the coastal part of an Eastern Arabian subregion referred to as 'Tawam', which comprises the city of Al Ain in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and the adjacent Omani town of Al-Buraimi. Measuring about , the site lay along a caravan route linking India and China to Oman and Iraq.\n\nHistorically, Emirati people living in Jumeirah were fishermen, pearl divers and traders. At the turn of the 20th century, it was a village of some 45 areesh (palm leaf) huts, inhabited mainly by settled Bedouin of the Bani Yas and Manasir tribes. At the time, Jumeirah was 'about 3 miles southwest of Dibai town'.\n\nIn modern times (1960 onwards), Jumeirah was the principal area for western expatriate residences. The beachfront area was previously called \"Chicago Beach\", as the site of the former \"Chicago Beach Hotel\". The locale's peculiar name had its origins in the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company which at one time welded giant floating oil storage tankers called 'Kazzans' on the site. The old name persisted for a time after the old hotel was demolished in 1997. \"Dubai Chicago Beach Hotel\" was the Public Project Name for the construction phase of the Burj Al Arab Hotel until Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the new name - \"Burj Al Arab\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality has a total land area of , representing about 11.59 percent of the total land area of the province.\n\nAt present, Basud is composed of 29 barangays after the poblacion was divided into two on June 6, 1988, through the initiative of late Municipal Councilor Modesto A. Zepeda during the incumbency of then Mayor Silverio F. Quiñones Jr. Population shown from 2010 census. Today, the town is headed by new administration under the name of elected Mayor Dominador \"Jun\" Davocol from 2010 to present.\nIn the , the population of Basud, Camarines Norte, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe municipal population is unevenly distributed over its 29 barangays and varies in terms of population sizes and growth rates. The barangays along the national road recorded the highest population share. In 2007 San Felipe recorded a population share of 8.63%, Barangay Poblacion 1 and Matnog followed with 8.02% and 7.79%, respectively. Binatagan has the least population with 295 or 0.80% of the total population.\n\nThe municipality's lands, which are devoted to agriculture, have an approximate area of 12,086.60 hectares or 47.38% percent of the municipality's total land area. The municipality is producing three major agricultural crops. Coconut land occupies the largest area that has 10,324 hectares. Rice land, which has the second largest area with 627.10 hectares irrigated and 254 hectares rainfed. The third is 586 hectares planted to pineapple. Other crops are seasonal crops and are being for family consumption only.\n\nCopra is known to be the chief product and the main source of income of the municipality. Coconut by-products such as brooms, baskets, charcoal and even soap making are the traditional sources of income of the people.\n\nThe second major product of the municipality is palay, which is harvested twice a year in irrigated areas of 627.10 hectares, which has an average yield of 80 cavans per cropping of 74.24 MT per year. Rainfed areas are being harvested once a year with 60 cavans per hectare per cropping or 17.04 MT per year and even lesser in times of calamities and drought.\n\nPineapple, which lately bloomed in production due to the government assistance on crop loan, has made farmers to plant most of the coco-based areas. It occupies an area of 586 hectares. Pineapple production is usually 18 to 20 months before it can be harvested.\n\nThe present livestock production is primarily on small-scale basis with mostly backyard farming except those who produce broilers, which range from 100 to 300 birds. Poultry such as native chicken are usually few in numbers per farmer and subsist on stray grain and grasses. Pest and diseases often attack the birds, thus dwindle the stock and produces low quality chickens.\n\nHogs are also a backyard activity. There are usually 1 to 2 stocks per farmer. The housing is built of light local materials. Breeding and inter-breeding with poor quality species results to a smaller and slower hog variety. Farmers cannot afford to have high quality breed because of high capital including the high cost of feeds and the risk in raising this kind of variety, thus diminishing the margin of profit.\n\nThe municipality has two coastal barangays namely: Taba-taba and Mangcamagong situated along the coast of San Miguel Bay. Most of the fishermen here are sustenance fishermen with limited fishing paraphernalia and few own fishing boats of three tons gross and less.\n\nFish caught in this area are customarily brought and hauled in Mercedes since most of these fishermen have consignment deals with fish dealers. Few are sold in Basud town proper through rigaton. The necessity to improve the road and market facilities will possibly change the trend of fish marketing here in Basud. Likewise, fishermen themselves could directly market their catch to Manila and command a higher price without so much cost on fuel.\n\nThe municipality of Basud significantly improved for the last ten years in terms of commerce. The municipal officials focused their attention at the municipality public market as the center of commerce. It was established in 1990 seven fresh fish stalls, meat stalls, vegetables stalls, dried fish stalls, sari-sari stores, agricultural stall, hardware, drugstore, bakery and dry good stall.\n\nStudy reveals that occupants vacated their stalls due to poor or lack of patronage on the part of the people and an insufficient capital on the part of the stallholders.\n\n\nThe municipality is rich in mineral resources such as diatomaceous earth (DE) or commonly called white clay. This is one of the income generating industries of the municipality. This non-metallic mineral can be found in barangays Caayunan, San Pascual, Oliva and San Felipe. It has a total approximate reserve of 1,289,600 metric tons.\n\n\nThe municipality has a viable source of sand and gravel. The Bactas River located in Pagsangahan and Oliva is a source of mixed gravel and coarse aggregate. It is being extracted by mining concessionaries. Matnog is another source of construction aggregates including sand that is being extracted by the barangay people.\n\n\nLand transportation is the primary means of transporting people, goods and services from the barangay to the town proper of Basud. While sea transport is being used by the municipality's two coastal barangays, namely: Taba-taba and Mangcamagong, they often use during summer as an alternative route to the fishing town of Mercedes.\n\n\nThe municipal proper is being linked to its different barangays by the municipality's two major roads, namely the Maharlika Highway and the Mangcamagong provincial road. The Maharlika highway has a total length of 25.50 kilometers stretching from the boundary of the municipality of Daet to the Camarines Norte - Camarines Sur boundary. The Mangcamagong provincial road has a total length of 9.46 kilometers, stretching from the municipal boundary of Basud and Mercedes to the junction of Maharlika highway.\n\nThe municipality has a total road network of 138.057 kilometers composed of 25.50 kilometers of national highway and 23.16 kilometers of provincial roads including 83.481 kilometers of barangay roads and 5.956 kilometers of municipal streets.\n\n\nBasud has fish ports serving the two coastal barangays of Mangcamagong and Taba-taba. To this date, said fish port that the government spent more than one million pesos cannot fully serve for its main purpose, first, due to its almost dilapidated structure and secondly, there is no big fishing vessels using the port.\n\n\nThe different barangays of the municipality is being served by levels I, II and III water supply. As of 2001, serving with potable water is 4,110 households. CNWD was serving 2,558 households mostly in barangays Poblacion I, Poblacion II and part of barangays Matnog, Bactas and Mocong. The municipality's water consumers are consuming an average of 07.4 cubic meters per day. To cope with the consumption demand especially during summer, the CNWD has constructed an elevated water tank with a capacity of 200 cubic meters and implementing the “Tubig ng Buhay, Hatid sa Barangay” program.\n\nBarangays San Pascual, Caayunan, Tuaca and San Felipe are being served by spring development. Other barangays are being served by shallow wells, deep wells or dug wells.\n\n\nBasud has been served by electric power, formerly by the defunct Hidalgo Electric Enterprise, now by the National Power Corporation through the Camarines Norte Electric Cooperative (CANORECO). After the establishment of this cooperative, there was a great improvement in terms of power supply condition in the municipality.\n\n\nBasud has a telecommunication system that is being run by one personnel of the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC). There are two satellites of Smart and Globe in Poblacion II. There is postal office and has a staff of one mail carriers serving all barangays in the municipality. These personnel cannot adequately serve the entire from the lack of personnel; another problem is the difficulty in the delivery of mails in the remote and far-flung barangays.\n\nThe municipality has 26 elementary schools, two National High Schools and 31 Day Care Centers. Barangay Caayunan has two elementary schools while barangays Mantugawe, Binatagan and Manmuntay has no existing one. There are four High School namely: Basud National High School at Poblacion Uno and Amoguis, San Felipe National High School at Barangay San Felipe, Tuaca National High at Barangay Tuaca and Dominador Narrido High School at Barangay Taisan.\n\nThere are five major tourist attractions in the municipality, this are;\nOther historic spots, religious shrine, natural and scenic spots, parks and other man made attractions is cherished places of the beautiful town of Basud.\n\nThe municipal government has many plans for the development of these tourist potentials but considering its limited resources, the same was left behind.\n\n"}

This name was derived from a wild plant called \"Palong Manok\", which looks like a rooster's comb. It is said that whenever the settlers of Apalong went to other places and asked where they came from, the usual reply is \"We came from Kapalungan\". Historians may comment that the natives were either referring to their place which has many \"Palong\" (roster's comb) or maybe they wanted identification for their settlement. Whatever it was, no record will show and no one at that time is still living, what is clearly known to Capalongueños is that this place was and still is an environment of flowers called Palong Manok.\nIn 1572, the Spanish Conquistador Capt Juan de Salcedo and his men reached pacific shores and landed on Kapalongan settlement. Instead of finding gold, they found abundant wild beautiful red flowers that looked like roster's comb. The Spaniards built a church, formed a government, and the village was made a town and officially named Capalonga. The Spaniards for some years persisted on mining for gold at Sitio Maglagonlong, and the Spanish control was described to be brutal, harsh and full of harassment until they went away leaving behind imprints on the community's cultural heritage.\n\nIt is also believed that the first migrants of Capalonga came from the neighbouring province of Quezon, formerly Tayabas. This is the reason that out of the twelve (12) municipalities of Camarines Norte, Capalonga has the highest rating and accent in speaking the Tagalog language. However, with the continuous migration process, mixed dialects has been produced. Today, like other places in the country, the dialects of the residents were enriched by various local medium of expression, thereby making no difference from the trend of other political units.\n\nWithout roads and being isolated from other towns by mountains, forest, rivers and sea, Capalonga remained relatively undeveloped by commerce and industry as late as the 1950s. In 1956, the road to Capalonga was opened. Still, growth had been slow until Martial law changed the pace. It was in the years 1987 to 1992 that all wooden and temporary bridges have been replaced by concrete bridges. Likewise, in the late part of 2003 up to the present, the paving of the Bagong Silang - Capalonga Road has started and existence of the air-conditioned van transport is now available as a result.\n\nIn the , the population of Capalonga was people, with a density of .\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is a popular surfing spot among surfers worldwide. It is also home to the annual Daet International Aerosports Show, first held in 2013.\n\nThe name \"Daet\" was derived from the Bikol word \"dai-daitan\" which means, \"close to each other\". \"Daet\" also originated from ancient Bicol term \"daet\" which, according to the first Bicol Spanish Dictionary \"Vocabulario de la Lengua Bicol\" authored by Fray Marcos de Lisboa, would mean \"to make friend\" or \"to be reconciled\".\n\nDaet was already an old community even before the discovery of the Philippines by Magellan in 1521. An ancient tomb unearthed in the Bicol region revealed references described in the Panayam manuscripts known to oriental history as corresponding to the first half of the thirteenth century. The early settlers were believed to be direct descendants of the group of datus who escaped from the court of Brunei (Borneo) to evade the enmity of a ruling rajah .\n\nIn 1571, Juan de Salcedo arrived at the Bicol Region in quest for gold found in Camarines Norte and discovered that Daet was already a thriving settlement and noted that the houses were clustered together for reason of safety and protection. In June 1583, through a Franciscan Order confirmed the founding of Doctrinas including Daet.\n\nLong after the implantation of the Spanish sovereignty, Don Juan de Salcedo, “talented, dashing grandson of Legazpi ” found this community in the course of an expedition in search of gold which the Camarines mountains were heart to abound, marking the beginning of over a three-century Spanish regime patterned after the sword and the cross.\n\nIn the meantime, an incident happened in the court of Spain over the romances of a woman which pressed the King to exile a Spanish noble to the Philippines who eventually chose to come this way to spend the rest of his life, forget all, and start life anew. This noble was Don Manuel de la Estrada, Marquis de Camarines , who devoted a lifetime to help implement the Spanish colonization blueprint in the building of a new town over our old community. He supervised the construction of the church as it stands today, the old Spanish to exile a Spanish noble to the Philippines who eventually bridge (now covered by a Bailey bridge ), other stone bridges buildings. He also brought the first abaca seedlings and encouraged its cultivation which has given the Philippines the world monopoly of hemp fiber. Incidentally, from the union of this noble to a Filipino woman followed a long line of blood relation which still link most of the old families of this community. The ruins of the palatial mansion of the Marquis de Camarines were still visible in recent years, on the spot where the new building of the Provincial Capitol now stands.\n\nExcept for recurring raids by the Moro pirates who occasionally came on their fast frail vintas to pillage this community causing the fortification of barrio Mercedes (now an independent municipality since 1948) during the Spanish regime, this community lived progressively in blissful peace and contentment. Formerly, the whole of the present Province of Camarines Norte was known as the District of Daet and this capital was a “Comandancia” of the original province of Camarines during the Spanish regime. In the few times that the Province of Camarines Norte was separated from and again fused with Camarines Sur from the Spanish to the American regimes, Daet always retained her importance as the provincial capital. In the ensuing changes, this municipality lost further much of her territory which was restored to Camarines Sur, and due to the segregation of the Municipality of Basud which was a former barrio of this community in the year 1908.\n\nNo less than thirteen martyrs were contributed by this community before the altar of liberty. They were butchered or burned alive and buried in a common grave during the Holy Week on Easter Sunday, April 1898. The local “insurrectus ”, however, made a remarkable feat in the last days of the Spanish regime when they succeeded in containing the Spanish local garrison and subjected them under relentless attack. The Spaniards were dramatically saved from annihilation by burning at the timely arrival of their rescue ship. Daet today takes a distinct pride for owning the first monument ever erected in the Philippines in honor of the foremost Filipino hero and martyr, Dr. Jose P. Rizal Protacio y Mercado , at the inspiration of Don Antonio Sans, Commanding Officer of the Philippine Revolutionary Forces in the sector.\n\nThe Philippine–American War was felt very little in this town. The American forces came unopposed on March 4, 1900 when almost the rest of the Bicol Region was subdued by Major McNamee under the overall command of General Bates before whom Commander Antonio Sans previously arranged in Camarines Sur the terms of surrender which were acceptable to the American Command. The strides undergone by this community under the American regime is yet to be written in bold letters of gold, a period which brought about the present day progress of this generation.\n\nOn the evening of September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos announced on television that he had placed the Philippienes, including Daet, under martial law. The marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one-man rule; even though the document proclaiming Martial Law was formally lifted on January 17, 1981, Marcos retained essentially all of his powers as dictator until he was deposed by the February 1986 People Power revolution.\n\nOn June 14, 1982 Marcos administration forces opened fire on protesters from different barrios, who were marching to demand an increase in copra prices, and to denounce \"fake elections\" and Cocofed. Four people died on the spot, and at least 50 were injured. Two of those who were seriously wounded died two months later. This has come to be known as the \"1981 Daet massacre,\" and four of those killed have since been honored by having their names engraved on the Wall of Remembrance at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani memorial.\n\nA P30-million government center, a P30-million transport terminal and an improved airport are among the large-scale face-lift projects that Camarines Norte's capital town plans to embark on as it aggressively vies for cityhood.\n\nThe projects, including a new face of the town plaza, were presented by Mayor Tito Sarion in an executive report last month. \"The enhancement of the elevated plaza is necessary to decongest the downtown in an attempt to rebuild the center of the commercial district,\" he said.\n\nSarion said the United Architects of the Philippines had agreed to design the new plaza through a P3-million grant provided by the party-list group Bayan Muna.\n\nThe funds for the government center and transport facility will be borrowed from the Land Bank of the Philippines, while the revitalized Bagasbas airport project will be funded by the Air Transportation Office (ATO).\n\nSarion said the proposed government center would make transactions with provincial and national government agencies more convenient while the new legislative hall would \"create a breathing space and a better working environment at the municipal hall, where offices are crowded.\"\n\nDaet is politically subdivided into 25 barangays.\nIn the , the population of Daet, Camarines Norte, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe municipality is rich in mineral resources such as diatomaceous earth (DE) or commonly called white clay.

Because of the attention it has gotten from the local surfing community, the Philippine Department of Tourism turned it into a local accredited surfing spot. \n\nAside from being a spot for surfing and kiteboarding, the Calaguas group of islands, in the jurisdiction of Vinzons, to its north has garnered attention from local and foreign tourists alike. The islands can be considered virgin since no resorts have been created there yet.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pineapple Festival (or \"Pinyasan\" as it is called by the locals) is considered to be the most colorful festivals in Camarines Norte. The festival started in 1992, and is about the province's prime agricultural product, which is the \"Queen of All Pineapple\" pineapple. Noted for its sweetness and flavor, this kind of pineapple is produced only in Camarines Norte, thereby making it a specialty in the province. The festival goes on for about 10 days, and several events are held in the municipality. The festival aims to promote the culture of Daet and its citizens. The Pineapple Festival is held every 22–26 June annually initiated by Mayor Tito Sarte Sarion\n\nThe Bantayog Festival celebrates the founding of Camarines Norte. As of 2009, it has been 89 years since the province has become independent, since March 3, 1975, when Ambos Camarines (At that time Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur were one province) was split from two. This festival promotes the province as one which has unnoticed potential in the fields of tourism and commerce, and also the rich culture and hospitality of the people of Camarines Norte. The Bantayog Festival is held every March or April annually. It was launched in April 1982.\n\n"}

It was the Spaniards, drawn by the rumor of immense gold deposits in the Mambulao-Paracale district, who mastered in exploring the gold mining potentials of these towns.\n\nFrom the 1750s to 1800s, Paracale held the major Spanish mines, but due to its closure in the 1790s, its people were living in desultory gold washing, fishing and selling betel nut to Mambulao which has now became the mining center. During that time, there were plenty of small shops but there’s no rice fields and vegetable gardening. All necessities came from Ambos Camarines and Tayabas (Quezon). Fifteen years later, the mines of Mambulao were no longer open. There was still some haphazard gold washing by women of Indio Class whose husbands, it was alleged, gambled away their meager earning in card games run by the town mayor. But by 1818, the population was back to the levels of the 1790s and by the mid-1820s annual gold production levels ran as 3,200 ounces (90.7 kg.) worth Php. 44,000 at prevailing prices. By 1829, Camarines Norte was considered to be wealthy and populous enough to warrant separation as province of its own for the first time. But after the 1840s the mining and population declined. Dr. Fedor Jagor (in his book Travels in the Philippines and The former Philippines thru Foreign Eyes), a well known German traveler who visited Mambulao in 1859, reported that it was thinly populated and that the mining mania was already ruined. From 1837 to 1876 the population of Mambulao and Paracale decreased by 30%.\n\nFrom 1900 until the early twenties, Mambulao was a sleepy town, isolated from the other towns of Camarines Norte. During the gold bloom, it was dubbed as “Little Manila”, due to flourishing business operated by Filipinos, Chinese, Japanese, Syrians and many others. Dutch-born Filipino citizen Jan Hendrik Marsman operated two rich mines during the American occupation, a substantial dredging operation and the Philippines only smelter located in the Mambulao- Paracale district. The population quadrupled between 1918 and 1938. One of the most notable mining company to operate in this municipality is the Philippine Iron Mines, then the largest iron mine in Asia.\n\nMining companies operating in Jose Panganiban include:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Larap (Jose Panganiban) Airport (ICAO Code: RPUP), formerly operated by the Philippine Iron Mines, covers an area of approximately 35 hectares and with existing 1,400 meter stretched runway.

Bagacay serves as a boundary between municipalities of Paracale and Labo and it as well guards the municipality from strong north winds especially during typhoons. Mt. Labo, Mt. Bagacay, and Mt. Cadig are the three major known dormant volcanoes in the municipality. The north-west portion of the municipality is greatly affected by 2 major fault and earthquake lines accruing in the province, while other trends affect north-north-west along Mt. Cadig passing through the barangays of Guisican and Bayabas. Like its neighbors, Panganiban and Paracale, there is a vast deposit of gold ore in the mountains of Labo, Camarines Norte. It is believed that Mt. Bagacay hides the treasures of Gen. Yamashita and is the target of both local and foreign treasure hunters and bounty seekers.\n\nThere is no pronounced dry season and maximum rain period from December to January.\n\nLabo is politically subdivided into 52 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Labo, Camarines Norte, was people, with a density of .\n\nLabo being located at the center of the province \nserves as the agricultural center as well as potential investment destination and promotion center for business, trades, and secondary industrial growth center. It is abundant with natural resources such as gold, nickel, iron, magnetite sand, copper, lead and manganese. Most of the provincial water supplies are located at barangay Tulay na Lupa and Lugui which serves seven out of the 12 municipalities. Agriculture is the leading livelihood of the residents of Labo. Due to abundant forest products such as rattan and bamboo, local folks tend to manufacture and market handicrafts.\n\nAn area of 390.39 km² (65.17% of municipal's land area) is devoted to agricultural crop production, 343.46 km² of which are coconut plantations. On the other hand, 18.47 km² is used for rice production. Banana production is also popular in the province, followed by Pineapple and Pili.\n\nTourism is also a good source of income for Labo, being surrounded by freshwater and mountains suitable for hikings.\n\nOther community livelihood follows: pineapple and coco-based processing and preservation, pineapple weaving (Barong), jewelry making and accessories, foods manufacturing and beverages processing, other tourism related industries and wood and bamboo furniture making.\n\n\nThese traditions and beliefs are still widely practiced. Despite the growth of modern technologies, almost everybody still believes in luck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Canyoning is frequently done in remote and rugged settings and often requires navigational, route-finding and other wilderness travel skills.\n\nOn April 9, 2017 five explorers from Camarines Norte was given a permit by Nelson P. Delos Santos (Municipal Mayor) and Mr. Manuel Racho (Municipal Tourism Officer) to explore the Nacali Falls river and mampurog river as part of their dream to create a comprehensive list of waterfalls and different natural attractions in the province. One member of the team, Mr. Benjie S. Ilagan is a resident of Barangay Mampurog and has visited Nacali Falls for more than five times. The other members of the team are as follows: Mr. Kimber Kaye S. Reyes as the team leader and navigator; Mr. Chris A. Camus the scribe; Mr. Gilbert Parale the timer and Mr. Jossiah Nathaniel M. Parena, aspiring to become a mountaineer and the youngest member of the group. \nA preliminary exploration was conducted prior to the actual exploration for the preparation and planning of the team. The team was surprised to see several meters of canyons and deep part of river that is suitable for canyoning Activities. The waterfalls can also be used for rappelling activities. The team also saw different waterfalls created by the big boulders present in the river.\nAfter six hours of river trekking and canyoning from the Nacali Falls river junction, the team found out that due to the limited time of the exploration, Mampurog river was not reached. Thus, the team recommends to the municipal Mayor and the tourism officer to allow them to explore the place in the future.\n\nThe recent discovery of a R. manillana haven in Mt. Guinatungan, a lesser-known mountain in Camarines Norte, Philippines, not only provided additional locality of distribution, but also resulted to better understanding of the taxonomic complexity of the \"Rafflesia species\". While available literatures cite Rafflesia as critically endangered, it seems otherwise in Camarines Norte. A recent Rafflesia expedition showed significant populations of this species. This situation calls for a multi-agency approach in management and actions integrating research and development that are focused on the conservation and protection not only of the species but more importantly its host and habitat.\n\nMr. George De Mesa Cordovilla, one of the participants in the “Tukad Bicol, Tukad Labo” Bantayog Festival climb organized by the Oryol Outdoor Group Inc. on April 15, 2016 was able to take a snapshot of the rafflesia flower.

{"id": "2083865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083865", "title": "A Ring of Endless Light", "text": "A Ring of Endless Light\n\nA Ring of Endless Light is a 1980 novel by Madeleine L'Engle. The book tells of teenager Vicky Austin and her struggle to understand life and significance in the universe as she deals with her dying grandfather, while at the same time finding true romantic love. The title originates from a phrase in the seventeenth-century Welsh poet Henry Vaughan's poem \"The World.\" \n\nFifteen-year-old Vicky Austin and her family are spending the summer on Seven Bay Island with her maternal grandfather, who is dying of leukemia. At the beginning of the story, Vicky attends a funeral for Commander Rodney, a family friend. Also present are the commander's wife, his sons Leo and Jacky who own a launch boat business, and Adam Eddington, an intern at the Island's research base and friend of Vicky's brother, John.\n\nAfter the funeral Vicky encounters Zachary Gray, her boyfriend from the previous summer whom her family does not particularly like. She soon learns that Zachary indirectly caused Commander Rodney's death; the commander had his heart attack while saving Zachary from a suicide attempt. This revelation and others set Vicky on a train of thought that continues throughout the book; the mysterious and (to Vicky) frightening topic of death. Death and the threat of it seem to loom everywhere, from news reports to the death of a baby dolphin, from the recent demise of Zach's mother in an automobile accident to Grandfather Eaton's slow deterioration.\n\nDuring the course of the story, Vicky finds herself in a tangle of three romances; one with the solid, unexciting Leo, one with dark and dangerous Zachary, and one with the gentle but emotionally damaged Adam, whom she is helping with a project on dolphin and human communication (ESP) with three dolphins: Basil, Norberta, and Njord. Vicky discovers a remarkable rapport with the dolphins, an unspoken communication that borders on telepathy. Her ability extends to communicating with Adam as well, but he pulls away, unwilling to allow that level of intimacy after a devastating betrayal the previous summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Vicky must help out at home, facing her grandfather's increasing confusion as he identifies Vicky with his dead wife. He has also been hemorrhaging, and Vicky often goes with Leo to pick up blood. There at the hospital, she meets a girl named Binnie who is sick with a type of leukemia and has seizures. Binnie's father is radically religious and is constantly disposing of the medication that controls the seizures.\n\nOne night, her grandfather starts to hemorrhage and is sent to the hospital. Vicky is on a date with Zachary, and does not know about her grandfather's medical crisis until they come to the dock and see that Leo is not there to pick them up. Zachary rushes Vicky to the hospital, and eventually abandons her there. As she waits in the emergency room, she is spotted by Binnie's mother, who leaves her unconscious daughter with Vicky while she goes to find a nurse. Binnie has a convulsion and dies in Vicky's arms. This latest trauma sends Vicky into a wave of darkness, an almost catatonic state in which she is only vaguely aware of reality. Vicky's parents and Leo, who are already upset because Vicky's grandfather has been bleeding internally, try unsuccessfully to comfort and communicate with her. Then she feels hands on hers - Adam's. He tells her that she \"called\" him (meaning with ESP) and he came.\n\nThe next day, Vicky is still in a wave of darkness. Her grandfather tells her that it is hard to keep focused on the good and positive in life but she must bear the light or she will be consumed by darkness. He also removes the emotional burden he placed on her earlier, when he asked her to tell him when it was time to die. Vicky is unable to listen, too caught up in her own misery. Finally Adam takes her into the ocean, where Vicky's dolphin friends break through her mental darkness, until she is able to play with them and face the light again.\n\nThe primary theme of the story is death, and continuing to appreciate and choose life in the face of it. Vicky is surrounded by death during the summer of the story, and the people around her have their own responses to it as well. Slowly dying from leukemia, Grandfather Eaton encourages Vicky to enjoy life while developing her talent for writing, and only gradually begins to make unreasonable demands as his own mental clarity starts to fail. Having lost his father, Leo Rodney questions his previously comfortable faith, while taking responsibility for the family's income. Zachary, whose mother died recently, alternately courts death - driving too fast, flying recklessly in a plane - and runs away from it. Adam, who holds himself responsible for the death of Joshua Archer the previous summer (in \"The Arm of the Starfish\") because he trusted a girl, is reluctant to open his heart and risk being hurt again. In addition to the deaths of Commander Rodney and Binnie and the impending death of her grandfather, Vicky meets a dolphin researcher who nearly dies in an accident, sees a dolphin swim with her dead baby, and even worries about baby swallows in a shallow, ill-placed nest.\n\nRelated to this is the theme of religious faith in the face of death, a problem Vicky previously confronted in \"The Moon by Night\". After observing her grandfather's joyful faith even in the midst of death and impending death at Commander Rodney's funeral, Vicky sees how Rodney's death has shaken his son Leo's once comfortable faith, and is confronted again with Zach's nihilism. After a brief period of despair after the death of Binnie, Vicky's faith is restored by the dolphins, whose songs she compares with \"alien alleluias\".\n\n\nThis is the fourth full-length novel about Vicky and her family, continuing a series that began in 1960 with \"Meet the Austins\". (There are also two shorter works that each take place at Christmas time.) Vicky first meets Zachary in the second novel, \"The Moon by Night\", as he follows her from campground to campground on a cross-country trip. In the next book, \"The Young Unicorns\", Zachary is mentioned only in passing. Concurrent with \"The Moon by Night\" is \"The Arm of the Starfish\", a book from the O'Keefe family series that takes place the same summer as the Austins' camping trip. \"The Arm of the Starfish\" introduces as its protagonist Adam Eddington. Adam continues his relationship with Vicky Austin in the sixth and final Austin family novel, \"Troubling a Star\".\n\n\"A Ring of Endless Light\" was named Newbery Honor Book in 1981. It also won the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award, the California Young Reader Medal (1982) and the Colorado Children's Book Award (1983).\n\nIn 2002, the Disney Channel made \"A Ring of Endless Light\" into a made-for-TV movie starring Mischa Barton and Ryan Merriman. The film's plot veered substantially from that of the book. Vicky's parents are conveniently absent for much of the movie. Vicky's astronomy-minded elder brother John is not mentioned, and Suzy is interested in astronomy instead of medicine. Grandfather Eaton's illness is undisclosed at first, instead of being the reason the family is spending the summer with him. Other examples of death and dying are absent entirely from the movie, along with such characters as Leo Rodney and his family, and the dying child Binnie. Whole-cloth additions to the story include Adam and Zachary teaming up to save dolphins from illegal drift nets, and Vicky being under pressure to study science in order to gain admission to an elite school.\n\n"}

{"id": "2083870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083870", "title": "Sita", "text": "Sita\n\nSita is the central female character and one of the central figures in the Hindu epic, \"Ramayana\" and its other versions. She is described as the daughter of the earth goddess, Bhūmi or Prithvi and the adopted daughter of King Janaka of Videha and his wife, Queen Sunaina. She has a younger sister, Urmila, and the female cousins Mandavi and Shrutakirti. Sita is known for her dedication, self-sacrifice, courage and purity.\n\nSita, in her youth, chooses Rama, the prince of Ayodhya as her husband in a swayamvara—bride choosing the best from a crowd of suitors after a contest, where Rama proves his heroism and valor and martial power and \"defeats\" the other seekers for Seeta's hand in marriage. After the swayamvara, she accompanies her husband to his kingdom, but later chooses to accompany her husband, along with her brother-in-law Lakshmana, in his exile. While in exile, the trio settles in the Dandaka forest from where she is abducted by Ravana, the Rakshasa king of Lanka. She is imprisoned in Ashoka Vatika in Lanka until she is rescued by Rama, who slays her captor. After the war, in some versions of the epic, Rama asks Sita to undergo Agni Pariksha (an ordeal of fire) by which she proves her purity before she is accepted by Rama, which for the first time makes his brother Lakshmana get angry at him.\n\nIn some versions of the epic, the fire-god Agni creates Maya Sita, who takes Sita's place and is abducted by Ravana and suffers his captivity, while the real Sita hides in the fire. During the Agni Pariksha, Maya Sita and the real Sita exchange places again. While some texts say that Maya Sita is destroyed in the flames of Agni Pariksha, others narrate how she is blessed and reborn as the epic heroine Draupadi or the goddess Padmavati. Some scriptures also mention her previous birth being Vedavati, a woman Ravana tries to molest. After proving her purity, Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen. One day a man questioned the purity of Sita and in order to prove her purity and maintain the unquestionable dignity of Ayodhya kingdom and King Rama, she decides to leave the kingdom and sacrifice her place. Rama gave order to Lakshman to drop Sita in the forest near sage Valmiki's ashram. Years later, Sita returns to the womb of her mother, the Earth, for release from a cruel world as a testimony of her purity after she reunites her two sons Kusha and Lava with their father Rama.\n\nThe goddess is best known by the name \"Sita\", derived from the Sanskrit word \"sīta\", furrow.\n\nAccording to \"Ramayana\", Janaka found her while ploughing as a part of a yagna and adopted her. The word \"Sīta\" was a poetic term, its imagery redolent of fecundity and the many blessings coming from settled agriculture. The Sita of the \"Ramayana\" may have been named after a more ancient Vedic goddess Sita, who is mentioned once in the Rigveda as an earth goddess who blesses the land with good crops. In the Vedic period, she was one of the goddesses associated with fertility. A Vedic hymn () recites:\nIn \"Harivamsa\", Sita is invoked as one of the names of the goddess Arya:\nThe \"Kausik-sutra\" and the \"Paraskara-sutra\" associate her repeatedly as the wife of Parjanya (a god associated with rains) and Indra.\n\nSita is known by many epithets. She is called \"Jānaki\" as the daughter of Janaka and \"Maithili\" as the princess of Mithila. As the wife of Rama, she is called \"Ramā\". Her father Janaka had earned the sobriquet \"Videha\" due to his ability to transcend body consciousness; Sita is therefore also known as \"Vaidehi\".\n\nDevi Sita while playing with her sisters in childhood had unknowingly lifted the table over which the bow had been placed; this was something that no one in Mithila could do. This incident was however observed by Janaka and he decided to make it a backdrop for Swayamvara because he wanted a son-in-law who was as strong as his daughter.\n\nThe birthplace of Sita is disputed. The Sita Kund pilgrimage site which is located in present-day Sitamarhi district,Bihar, India is viewed as the birthplace of Sita. Apart from Sitamarhi, Janakpur which is located in the present-day Province No. 2, Nepal, is also described as Sita's birthplace.\n\nWhen Sita reaches adulthood, Janaka organizes a Swayamvara in Janakpurdham with the condition that Sita would marry only that person who would be able to string \"Pinaka\", the bow of the god Shiva. Janaka knew that the bow of Shiva was not even liftable, let alone stringable for ordinary mortals, and for selfish people it was not even approachable. Thus, Janaka tries to find the best husband for Sita.\n\nAt this time, Vishvamitra had brought Rama and his brother Lakshmana to the forest for the protection of sacrifice. Hearing about this \"swayamvara\", Vishvamitra asks Rama to participate in it and takes Rama and Lakshmana to the palace of Janaka in Janakpur. Janaka is greatly pleased to learn that Rama and Lakshmana are sons of Dasharatha. Next morning, in the middle of the hall, Rama lifts up the bow of Shiva with his left hand, fastens the string taut and breaks the bow in the process. However, another avatar of Vishnu, Parashurama, became really angry as the bow of Shiva was broken. However, he does not realize that Rama is also an avatar of Vishnu, therefore after being informed of this, he apologizes for getting angry. Thus, Rama fulfills Janaka's condition to marry Sita. Later on Vivaha Panchami, a marriage ceremony is conducted under the guidance of Satananda. Rama marries Sita, Bharata marries Mandavi, Lakshmana marries Urmila and Shatrughna marries Shrutakirti.\n\nSome time after the wedding, Kaikeyi, Rama's stepmother, compelled Dasharatha to make Bharata king, prompted by the coaxing of her maid Manthara, and forced Rama to leave Ayodhya and spend a period of exile in the forests of Dandaka and later Panchavati. Sita and Lakshmana willingly renounced the comforts of the palace and joined Rama in exile. The Panchavati forest became the scene for Sita's abduction by Ravana, King of Lanka. Ravana kidnapped Sita, disguising himself as a mendicant, while Rama was away fetching a golden deer to please her. Some versions of the \"Ramayana\" describe Sita taking refuge with the fire-god Agni, while Maya Sita, her illusionary double, is kidnapped by the demon-king. Jatayu, the vulture-king, tried to protect Sita but Ravana chopped off his wings. Jatayu survived long enough to inform Rama of what had happened.\nRavana took her back to his kingdom in Lanka and Sita was held as a prisoner in one of his palaces. During her captivity for a year in Lanka, Ravana expressed his desire for her; however, Sita refused his advances and struggled to maintain her chastity. Hanuman was sent by Rama to seek Sita and eventually succeeded in discovering Sita's whereabouts. Sita gave Hanuman her jewellery and asked him to give it to her husband. Hanuman returned across the sea to Rama.\n\nSita was finally rescued by Rama, who waged a war to defeat Ravana. Upon rescue, Rama makes Sita undergo a trial by fire to prove her chastity. In some versions of \"Ramayana\", during this test the fire-god Agni appears in front of Rama and attests to Sita's purity, or hands over to him the real Sita and declares it was Maya Sita who was abducted by Ravana. The Thai version of the Ramayana, however, tells of Sita walking on the fire, of her own accord, to feel clean, as opposed to jumping in it. She is not burnt, and the coals turn to lotuses. After proving that Sita is still pure, she returns to Ayodhya. But the citizens of Ayodhya don't accept Sita and says that she is impure, and Ram has to forcefully send Sita against his wish. After 12 yrs he goes back to Sita and asks her to come back to Ayodhya. But Sita denies and says Bhumi to take her inside herself. Sita goes inside the earth and gives her sons to Rama.\n\nThis section is not a part of the original Valmiki Ramayan, but is a part of Uttar Ramayan.\n\nThe couple came back to Ayodhya, where Rama was crowned king with Sita by his side.\n\nWhile Rama's trust and affection for Sita never wavered, it soon became evident that some people in Ayodhya could not accept Sita's long captivity under Ravana. During Rama's period of rule, an intemperate washerman, while berating his wayward wife, declared that he was \"no pusillanimous Rama who would take his wife back after she had lived in the house of another man\". This statement was reported back to Rama, who knew that the accusation against Sita was baseless.\n\nSita upon hearing about this incident knew that it would bring disgrace to the entire clan and hence decided to go and live in the forest. Thus Sita was forced into exile a second time. Sita, who was pregnant, was given refuge in the hermitage of Valmiki, where she delivered twin sons named Kusha and Lava. In the hermitage, Sita raised her sons alone, as a single mother. They grew up to be valiant and intelligent and were eventually united with their father. Once she had witnessed the acceptance of her children by Rama, Sita sought final refuge in the arms of her mother Bhūmi. Hearing her plea for release from an unjust world and from a life that had rarely been happy, the Earth dramatically split open; Bhūmi appeared and took Sita away.(Abounding of Devi Sīta appears in Uttara Kānda which is considered by some people as later added kanda).\n\nSita's exile during her pregnancy was because of a curse during her childhood. According to Padma-puran, Sita had caught a pair of divine parrots which were from Valmiki's ashram when she was young. The birds were talking about story of Sri Ram heard in Valmiki ashram which intrigued Sita. She has the ability to talk with animals. The female bird was pregnant at that time. She requested Sita to let them go and return from Valmiki's Ashram as they knew only up to their marriage but Sita only allowed her male companion to fly away but female parrot died because of separation from her companion. As a result, the male bird cursed Sita that she would suffer a similar fate of being separated from her husband during pregnancy. The male bird was reborn as the washerman.\n\nWhile the \"Ramayana\" mostly concentrates on Rama's actions, Sita also speaks many times during the exile. The first time is in the town of Chitrakuta where she narrates an ancient story to Rama, whereby Rama promises to Sita that he will never kill anybody without provocation.\n\nThe second time Sita is shown talking prominently is when she speaks to Ravana. Ravana has come to her in the form of a mendicant and Sita tells him that he does not look like one.\n\nSome of her most prominent speeches are with Hanuman when he reaches Lanka. Hanuman wants an immediate union of Rama and Sita and thus he proposes to Sita to ride on his back. Sita refuses as she does not want to run away like a thief; instead she wants her husband Rama to come and defeat Ravana to save her.\n\nSita was the daughter of king ‘Janak’ and queen ‘Videha’ of ‘Mithalapuri’. She had a brother named ‘Bhamandal’ who was kidnapped soon after his birth by a deity due to animosity in previous life. He threw him in a garden of ‘Rathnupur’ where he dropped in the arms of the king ‘Chandravardhan’ of Rathnupur. The king and queen brought him up as their own son with lot of love and care. It turns out that Ram & Sita get married due to Bhamandal and in the course of events Bhamandal realises that Sita is his real sister. It is then that he meets his birthgiving parents.\n\nA female deity of agricultural fertility by the name Sita was known before Valmiki's \"Ramayana\", but was overshadowed by better-known goddesses associated with fertility. According to \"Ramayana\", Sita was discovered in a furrow when Janaka was ploughing. Since Janaka was a king, it is likely that ploughing was part of a royal ritual to ensure fertility of the land. Sita is considered to be a child of Mother Earth, produced by union between the king and the land. Sita is a personification of Earth's fertility, abundance, and well-being.\n\nSwami Vivekananda states that Rama is considered the type of the Absolute and Sita that of Power. Sita is the ideal of a woman in India and worshiped as God incarnate.\n\nAccording to Swami Vivekananda, Sita is typical of India – the idealized India. Swami Vivekananda assured that if world literature of the past and world literature of the future were thoroughly exhausted, yet, it would not be possible to find another Sita, because Sita is unique; the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.\n\nVivekananda said:\n\nSita was a true Indian by nature, Vivekananda concluded, who never returned injury.\n\nHindu tradition reveres Sita. She has been portrayed as an ideal daughter, an ideal wife and an ideal mother in various texts, stories, illustrations, movies, and modern media. Sita is often worshipped with Rama as his consort. The occasion of her marriage to Rama is celebrated as Vivaha Panchami.\n\nThe actions, reactions, and instincts manifested by Sita at every juncture in a long and arduous life are deemed exemplary. Her story has been portrayed in the book Sitayanam. The values that she enshrined and adhered to at every point in the course of a demanding life are the values of womanly virtue held sacred by countless generations of Indians.\n\nAlthough Sita's statue is always kept with Rama's statue in Rama temples, there are some temples dedicated to Sita:\n\n\n\n"}

This resident cuckoo is found from Mexico and Trinidad south to Bolivia and Argentina.\n\nThe striped cuckoo is found in open country with trees or shrubs, and the edges of mangrove forests. It is among the very few brood parasitic cuckoos of the Americas (only other are \"Dromococcyx\"), and typical hosts are spinetails, but often also wrens, and other species with domed nests. The female cuckoo lays one, sometimes two, white or bluish eggs in the host's large stick nest. The eggs hatch in 15 days, with a further 18 days until the cuckoo fledges. The young spinetails disappear.\n\nThis species is about long and weighs . The adult is mainly grey-brown above, streaked with black and buff. It has a pale supercilium and a chestnut and black crest which is raised as part of its display. The underparts are off-white and the tail is long and graduated. Immature birds are spotted with buff and are more rufous on the back and wings.\n\nThe striped cuckoo eats large insects, often taken off the ground. This is a solitary and fairly shy species which tends to keep to the cover of bushes, although it will sing from more open perches. It has a whistled call usually of two or three notes, \"wu-weee\" or \"wu-wu-wee\", and can be attracted by imitations of this.\n\nThis bird is very important in Brazilian folklore, being related to the legend of the saci, or matita-perê.

{"id": "2083887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083887", "title": "The Hand (comics)", "text": "The Hand (comics)\n\nThe Hand is a fictional supervillain organization appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Hand first appeared in \"Daredevil\" volume 1 #174 (September 1981) and was created by writer/artist Frank Miller.\n\nThe Hand is an order of evil mystical ninjas who are heavily involved in organized crime and mercenary activities such as assassination plots. The Hand covets power above all other objectives. They are primarily based in Japan, but operate internationally. They were founded in 1588 as a secret society of Japanese nationalist samurai but were soon co-opted by the Snakeroot, an ancient ninja clan which serves a primordial demon known only as \"The Beast of the Hand\".\n\nMembers of the Hand are practitioners of powerful occult magic and can murder a person and bring that person back to life as a servant of the Hand, but a few are known to have reversed this programming. The Hand's most dangerous adversary is The Chaste, a band of warriors once led by Stick, the blind martial arts master and mentor of Matt Murdock, who grew to become the costumed crime-fighter Daredevil. Murdock would eventually, after many bitter battles, accept the offer of becoming the master of the Hand for a time.\n\nThe Hand made appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television shows \"Daredevil\", \"Iron Fist\", and \"The Defenders\".\n\nThe Hand first appeared in \"Daredevil\" volume 1 #174 (September 1981) and was created by writer/artist Frank Miller.\n\nThe story begins 800 years ago, in feudal Japan. Seeking autonomy from the oppressive class system of the time, a few citizens fled into the mountainous regions of Iga and Kōga. There they developed ninjitsu, a stealthy martial art perhaps inspired by Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\". Over a period of centuries, they refined their art in secluded camps. Students trained and practiced the art from birth, playing children's games designed to impart expertise in unarmed combat, swordplay, weaponry, camouflage, escape, and evasion. Ninjitsu was also designed to encourage spiritual growth by pushing oneself physically and mentally beyond normal human limits. The ninja were experts in espionage and assassination, and offered their specialized services to samurai warlords and others who could afford them.\n\nMasters of every form of subterfuge, the ninja were the most efficient and deadly warriors on the face of the Earth and became feared throughout Japan. Hearsay gave rise to the myth that ninja were the spawn of the Tengu, and that their divinity gave them extraordinary abilities. These myths were likely spread by the ninja themselves. Nonetheless, it would seem that an ancient ninja clan known as the Snakeroot can and does trace their bloodline back to these demons.\n\nIn 1588, Kagenobu Yoshioka became sensei of the Ishiyama Sword School located in the Japanese village of Kyushua. Facing growing frustrations with the corrupt government that had been tainted by foreign influence, Yoshioka transformed the school into a training ground for samurais whose goal was to put power back in the hands of the Japanese people. Thus, the Hand was born. Just as a hand has five fingers, members of the inner circle of the Hand were leaders of organizations which each operated from one of Japan's five islands.\n\nUpon the mutinous murder of Yoshioka, the Snakeroot ninja clan took control of the Hand and corrupted it by imposing the cult of a demon known as The Beast, which imbued them with dark magic. One of these black spells causes a Hand ninja's lifeless body to return to dust and prevent another from directly gazing at the Beast itself. Unlike the other factions of ninja, this \"new\" Hand both worked as mercenaries and sought power themselves. The Hand sought dominance over all others, working for allies of convenience while seeking to eliminate their enemies.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, a select few of the more politically oriented members of the Hand formed the original HYDRA as a cabal of Japanese ultranationalists who plotted to overthrow the Japanese liberal democratic government, assassinate the prime minister, and install a neo-militarist government, which would rearm Japan. Shortly upon joining HYDRA, Baron Strucker seized control of the organization from its Japanese founders and slowly steered the organization towards the goal of world domination. The Hand and HYDRA have nevertheless collaborated in numerous subversive or criminal conspiracies over the years.\n\nThe Hand has survived into the early 21st century, still seeking power in various forms, and using their lethal skills and brutal methods. The Hand's most dangerous adversary is The Chaste, a band of warriors once led by Stick, the late, blind martial arts master and former mentor of the man who grew to become the costumed crime-fighter Daredevil (Matt Murdock). Another of his former pupils, Elektra Natchios, has also been involved with the Hand. She infiltrated the Hand, determined to prove herself to Stick. Instead, the ninja tricked her into killing one of her former sensei. Elektra served the Hand for a time, but after their ways corrupted her soul, she fled Japan back to America.\n\nEventually, the Hand sought to wipe out Stick and the good warriors of the Chaste altogether. Stick thwarted an assassination attempt by four Hand operatives; he then summoned the other members of his order (Shaft, Stone, and Claw) to New York City. With the assistance of his clan, Stick defeated Kirigi, the Hand's most lethal ninja at the time. The Hand regrouped and attacked Stick and his band of warriors that now included Daredevil and his current lover, Black Widow. The Hand had almost overpowered the small band of warriors, when Stick and Shaft resorted to an ancient technique that drained the life force from all ninja present. Unfortunately, the technique resulted in the explosion of Stick and his comrade as a result of the excess energy they had absorbed. Despite their casualties and the escape of the Chaste's superhero allies, the Hand considered the destruction of their nemesis and leader of their enemy a victory and turned their attention to other schemes.\n\nYears later, the Hand turned its attention to the leaderless Chaste, once again attempting to destroy them, this time to prevent the Chaste's members from locating the new-born child that would bear Stick's reincarnated soul. The Hand severely crippled Stick's soldiers, reducing their number to a handful of warriors. The few remaining Chaste traveled to New York, seeking the assistance of Daredevil. Reluctantly, the Man Without Fear aided his former mentor's disciples, returning with them to Japan. Once there, the Hand attacked the Chaste and Daredevil relentlessly. Fighting alongside Daredevil, the Chaste barely managed to escape and safeguard their master's reincarnated spirit.\n\nThe Hand has also frequently fought with Wolverine and come into conflict with superheroes such as Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the X-Men. The Hand played a particularly large role in the history of Psylocke.\n\nElektra led the Hand for some time but when she was killed it was revealed that this Elektra was actually a Skrull, temporarily leaving the Hand without a warlord. One faction, led by Lord Hiroshi and his lieutenant Lady Bullseye, has aimed to make Daredevil their new leader, an offer the latter rejected, only to be told that \"the Hand doesn't take no for an answer.\" They then instigated the return of the Kingpin to New York City, with the goal of offering him the leadership instead. Kingpin's first act in negotiations is to kill Hiroshi with his bare hands, to \"thank him\" for realizing he can't escape his role as the Kingpin, and for murdering his girlfriend and her kids. However, the proceedings were interrupted by Daredevil, who accepted their offer, on the condition that the Hand should not do business with the Kingpin or Lady Bullseye again. The three remaining ninja-lords accepted this arrangement. During that time, the Hand gains Black Tarantula and White Tiger as members.\n\nThe Hand plays a major part in the 2010 \"Shadowland\" storyline where Daredevil uses the Hand as a force of justice. When Bullseye attacks his fortress, Daredevil ends up killing him in the same manner as Bullseye did to Elektra. Most of the street-based superheroes (consisting of Spider-Man, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Misty Knight, Moon Knight, Shang-Chi, and Colleen Wing) try to reason with Daredevil only for Kingpin and Lady Bullseye to unleash Ghost Rider upon Shadowland. Daredevil blames them for the diversion and has the Hand attack them. Following a fight with the street-based superheroes who escaped with Punisher's help, Daredevil states that he will plan to resurrect Bullseye to serve him. He is then approached by Elektra, who apparently swears her allegiance to him. The street-based heroes are visited by Master Izo, who states that the Snakeroot Clan plan to make Daredevil a vessel for the Beast of the Hand (who desires nothing but darkness and destruction). Later Colleen Wing learns from Daredevil that her mother had led a female faction of the Hand called the \"Nail\". Colleen eventually accepts Daredevil's offer to join the Nail. It is shown that the Hand also has a faction called the Underhand which are a group of ninjas that are already dead. This, when Luke Cage is visited by his old friend Lacy Kimbro, who tells Luke that her son Darris is among the cops that are held prisoners by the Underhand. Realizing that Daredevil is possessed by the demonic Beast of the Hand, the heroes gather together to try to fight him themselves. Despite their efforts to interrupt Bullseye's resurrection ceremony, even a direct attack from Wolverine fails to kill the now-demonic Daredevil. Daredevil throws off Elektra and Spider-Man's attempts to reason with him, as he proclaims \"\"There is no Murdock! There is only the Beast\"!\". Although Iron Fist is able to heal Daredevil of the 'infection' by using his chi punch to cure Daredevil's soul, Kingpin and Typhoid Mary take advantage of the chaos in the aftermath of the war to take command of the Hand for themselves.\n\nThe Hand later ends up in a gang war with the Yakuza which has been orchestrated by Sabretooth. \n\nAs part of the 2012 Marvel NOW! branding, Shadowland is attacked by Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body) and his Spiderlings as the Hand ninjas engage them. In the aftermath of the attack on Shadowland, some of the Hand ninjas who evaded capture arrive in the sewers to join up with the Goblin Nation which is led by Goblin King.\n\nFollowing the 2016 \"Civil War II\" storyline, the Hand has entered an allegiance with Daniel Drumm's ghost. After the funeral of Bruce Banner, the Hand steals his body so that they can use it to strengthen their ranks. The Uncanny Avengers find where the Hand is performing their ritual and that they have already revived Bruce Banner, who appears before them as Hulk wearing samurai armor. During that time, it was revealed that the Beast of the Hand was in control of the Hulk. The Uncanny Avengers were able to sever the Beast of the Hand's control as Bruce Banner returns to the dead.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, the Hand is encountered by the Underground in Madripoor where they are under the control of Hive.\n\nWhen Old Man Logan faces off against the Hand, he faced their latest member called the Scarlet Samurai. Logan later discovered that Scarlet Samurai is Mariko Yashida who was resurrected by the Hand to serve them.\n\n\nThe Kingpin contacts the Hand for assistance against the Punisher in the \"Homeless\" story-arc of \"Punisher Max\". While the organization provides the Kingpin with Elektra for use as a bodyguard, it refuses to directly hunt and eliminate the Punisher due to having the utmost respect for the vigilante and his prowess at killing. The Hand is later revealed to be in league with Vanessa Fisk, who intends to have Elektra seduce and murder the Kingpin.\n\nAfter the Punisher cripples Elektra and kills the Kingpin, the Hand recovers the former, and euthanizes her when it becomes apparent that the severity of her injuries have rendered her incapable of ever walking again.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His wife, Pratibha Singh, was a Lok Sabha member from Mandi.\n\nVirbhadra Singh was born on 23 June 1934 at Sarahan, Shimla district in the royal family of the princely state of Bushahr.\n\nSingh was educated at Colonel Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun, St. Edward's School, Shimla & Bishop Cotton School, Shimla and later obtained a BA Honours degree from St. Stephen's College, Delhi. He is married to Pratibha Singh and has a son and four daughters including Abhilasha Kumari.\n\nSingh gained a seat in the Lok Sabha — which is the lower house of the Parliament of India — in the Indian general elections of 1962. He repeated that success in the elections of 1967 and 1971. He was again elected to the Lok Sabha in 1980 and a further election to that house came in 2009, following an absence from the intervening two Lok Sabhas. His wife had served a term following her victory in the 2004 elections.\n\nHe was a member of the Indian Delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1976.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1977, Singh held the national office of Deputy Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation in central cabinet. He was Minister of State for Industries between 1980 and 1983. From May 2009 until January 2011, he held the cabinet post of Minister for Steel. He then became cabinet minister with responsibility for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, until resigning from office in June 2012.\n\nAside from his role in national politics, Singh has also been elected on seven occasions to the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly. The first occasion was in a by-election in October 1983, when he was returned for the Jubbal-Kotkhai constituency. He won that seat again in the 1985 elections. Thereafter, he was elected from the Rohru constituency in 1990, 1993, 1998 and 2003.\n\nSingh became the Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh for the first time in April 1983 and held the post until March 1990. He was again appointed to the role between December 1993 and March 1998; and once more from March 2003. With reappointments within those years, this record amounted to him holding the office on five occasions.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, Singh was Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly. He was also president of the Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee from February 1992 to September 1994, and leader of the Congress Legislative Group. He was president of the State Congress Committee in 1977, 1979 and 1980. In July 2012, he quit all key party posts at a crucial time prior to the state elections of November 2012. It has been reported that the trigger for the resignations was his exclusion from the Screening Committee for short-listing of election candidates.\n\nSingh was appointed to lead the party on the eve of the November 2012 elections and did so with success. The party then agreed to him becoming Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh for a record sixth time. His party lost majority in the 2017 elections and he tendered his resignation afterwards.\n\nOutside of politics, Singh has involvement with various social and cultural bodies. A consequence of these interests is that he has been president of the Sanskrit Sahitya Sammelan and of the Himachal Pradesh branch of the Friends of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn 3 August 2009, a legal case was registered against Singh and his wife by the Anti-Corruption Bureau of Himachal Pradesh. The allegations were that they had breached the Prevention of Corruption Act in 1989, when Singh was Chief Minister of the state. The Bureau alleged that it had evidence in recorded conversations between the couple and various others concerning suspect financial transactions. The alleged recordings, which involved a now-dead officer of the Indian Administrative Service and several industrialists, dated from 2007 and were provided by a political opponent, Vijai Singh Mankotia.\n\nThe couple were granted bail in December 2010 but in April 2011 the state government requested that this be rescinded due to allegations of witness tampering. This request followed attempts by two industrialists to remove themselves from the prosecution case, claiming that the evidence was forged and incorrect.\n\nThe Singhs have attempted to have the matter taken out of police hands and passed to the Central Bureau of Investigation, as well as seeking a stay on further trial court proceedings. In January 2012, the Himachal Pradesh High Court had refused the latest of their petitions aimed at achieving the transfer and stay. The court ordered that the examination of potential charges and evidence by a trial court should go ahead. On 26 June 2012, Singh resigned from the Union Cabinet as a consequence of corruption charges being pressed against him. The couple were acquitted on the eve of Singh taking the role of Chief Minister in December 2012.\n\nIn 2015 the Central Bureau of Investigation filed a case against Singh and his family for owning assets to the tune of Rs. 6.1 crore disproportionate to his known sources of income when he was the union minister between 2009 and 2011. Cases have been filed against his wife Pratibha Singh, son Vikramaditya and daughter Aparajita as well.\nOn Saturday, 26 September, the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) raided 11 properties of Virbhadra Singh to probe the charges of accumulating disproportionate assets. A case had been filed by the agency one day before the raids.\nOn 26 October 2015, the Indian Supreme Court turned down a CBI plea seeking stay against an earlier order issued by Himachal Pradesh High Court granting protection from arrest and other relief to him and his wife in a disproportionate assets case. The SC, however, issued a notice to Singh and his wife, seeking response from Singh on the two petitions filed by the CBI.\n"}

After several trips, one to Brazil, and one to Nova Zembla, Keyser participated as the chief navigator and head of the steersmen for the first Dutch voyage to the East Indies (the \"Eerste Schipvaart\"), which left Texel with four ships on 2 April 1595 under Cornelis de Houtman. He had been trained by cartographer Petrus Plancius in mathematics and astronomy. Plancius, a key promoter to the Dutch East Indies expeditions, had instructed Keyser to map the skies in the southern hemisphere, which were largely uncharted at the time. When the fleet finally was able to obtain fresh supplies at Madagascar on 13 September, 71 of the 248 sailors had died, most of scurvy. The surviving crew stayed for several months on the island, to recover and make repairs, at which point Keyser probably made most of his celestial observations. He was aided in this by Frederick de Houtman and Vechter Willemsz. After leaving Madagascar, it took another four months (February to June 1596) for the ships to reach Sumatra and finally Bantam on Java. Trade negotiations went sour, perhaps caused by Portuguese instigators, perhaps by inexperience, and the crew was forced to find drinking water and other supplies on Sumatra across the Sunda Strait. Keyser apparently died during this crossing. On 14 August 1597, 81 survivors made it back to Texel, including de Houtman, who probably delivered Keyser's observations to Plancius.\n\nFrom the observations of the expedition, Plancius created a celestial globe in late 1597, published by Jodocus Hondius, showing twelve new constellations of the southern sky that have become accepted among the standard constellations codified by modern astronomers. The majority were named after various animals that 16th century explorers had encountered (e.g. Bird of Paradise, Chameleon, Toucan, Flying Fish). Willem Janszoon Blaeu copied these constellations on a 1602 globe and created a new globe in 1603 incorporating further observations made by de Houtman on a second voyage to the East Indies. Johann Bayer included these new southern constellations in his influential 1603 star atlas \"Uranometria\", crediting them to \"Petrus Theodori\" (Pieter Keyser), but not acknowledging their earlier publication. Bayer is therefore often mistakenly credited for introducing them.\n\nKeyser is commemorated by minor planet (10655) Pietkeyser.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2083906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083906", "title": "Specific volume", "text": "Specific volume\n\nIn thermodynamics, the specific volume of a substance is the ratio of the substance's volume to its mass. It is the reciprocal of density and an intrinsic property of matter as well. Specific volume is defined as the number of cubic meters occupied by one kilogram of a particular substance. The standard unit is the cubic meter per kilogram formula_1.\n\nSpecific volume for an ideal gas is also equal to the gas constant (R) multiplied by the temperature and then divided by the pressure multiplied by molar mass of that ideal gas.\n\nSince formula_3 and formula_4 \n\nTypically, the specific volume of a substance is expressed in terms such as formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, or formula_9 .\n\nSpecific volume is commonly applied to:\n\nImagine a variable-volume, airtight chamber containing a certain number of atoms of oxygen gas. Consider the following four examples:\n\nSpecific volume is a property of materials, defined as the number of cubic meters occupied by one kilogram of a particular substance. The standard unit is the meter cubed per kilogram (m/kg or m·kg).\n\nSometimes specific volume is expressed in terms of the number of cubic centimeters occupied by one gram of a substance. In this case, the unit is the centimeter cubed per gram (cm/g or cm·g). To convert m/kg to cm/g, multiply by 1000; conversely, multiply by 0.001.\n\nSpecific volume is inversely proportional to density. If the density of a substance doubles, its specific volume, as expressed in the same base units, is cut in half. If the density drops to 1/10 its former value, the specific volume, as expressed in the same base units, increases by a factor of 10.\n\nThe density of gases changes with even slight variations in temperature, while densities of liquid and solids, which are generally thought of as incompressible, will change very little. Specific volume is the inverse of the density of a substance; therefore, careful consideration must be taken account when dealing with situations that involve gases. Small changes in temperature will have a noticeable effect on specific volumes.\n\nThe chart below is a visual representation of the relationship between specific volume and temperature. As stated above, specific volume varies noticeably with changes in temperature while the gas phase.\n\nThe average density of human blood is 1060 kg/m. The specific volume that correlates to that density is 0.00094 m/kg. Notice that the average specific volume of blood is almost identical to that of water: 0.00100 m/kg.\n\nIf one sets out to determine the specific volume of an ideal gas, such as super heated steam, using the equation\nformula_10\nwhere pressure is 2500 lbf/in, R is 0.596, temperature is 1960 Rankine. In that case, the specific volume would equal 0.4672 in/lb. However, if the temperature is changed to 1160 Rankine, the specific volume of the super heated steam would have changed to 0.2765 in/lb, which is a 59% overall change.\n\nKnowing the specific volumes of two or more substances allows one to find useful information for certain applications. For a substance X with a specific volume of 0.657 cm/g and a substance Y with a specific volume 0.374 cm/g, the density of each substance can be found by taking the inverse of the specific volume; therefore, substance X has a density of 1.522 g/cm and substance Y has a density of 2.673 g/cm. With this information, the specific gravities of each substance relative to one another can be found. The specific gravity of substance X with respect to Y is 0.569, while the specific gravity of Y with respect to X is 1.756. Therefore, substance X will not sink if placed on Y.\n\nThe table below displays densities and specific volumes for various common substances that may be useful. The values were recorded at standard temperature and pressure, which is defined as air at 0 °C (273.15 K, 32 °F) and 1 atm (101.325 kN/m, 101.325 kPa, 14.7 psia, 0 psig, 30 in Hg, 760 torr).\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> values not taken at standard temperature and pressure\n"}

The station is owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications, as part of a duopoly with Flagstaff-licensed UniMás owned-and-operated station KFPH-DT, channel 13 (which KTVW simulcasts on its second digital subchannel). The two stations share studios on 30th Street in southern Phoenix; KTVW's transmitter is located atop South Mountain on the city's south side. \n\nThe station's signal is relayed on two low-power translators: Class A station KTVW-CD (UHF digital channel 27, virtual channel 6) in Flagstaff, and KDOS-LD (UHF digital channel 29, virtual channel 50) in Globe. KTVW is also rebroadcast on the second digital subchannel of KFPH, whose transmitter is located atop Mormon Mountain, about south of Flagstaff in the Coconino National Forest.\n\nIn addition, KUVE-DT (channel 46) in Green Valley and KUVE-CD (channel 42) in Tucson operate as semi-satellites of KTVW-DT, expanding the Univision signal into Southern Arizona. As such, they simulcast all Univision programming as provided through their parent, and share a website with KTVW. However, the Tucson stations air separate commercial inserts and legal identifications. There is also a three-hour overnight segment on Monday mornings, in which the Tucson stations broadcast locally produced programming in accordance with KUVE-CD's Class A license. Local newscasts, produced by KTVW and branded as \"Noticias 33\", are simulcast on KUVE and KUVE-CD. Although KUVE maintains its own studios on Forbes Boulevard in Tucson, master control and most internal operations are based at KTVW's facilities.\n\nKTVW-TV was granted an original construction permit on September 15, 1977 and applied for its license on September 4, 1979, two days before it first signed on the air as Arizona's first full-time Spanish-language television station on September 2. From the day it signed on, KTVW-TV has been owned and operated by the same company: the Spanish International Network (SIN), which became Univision in 1987. Prior to being used by channel 33 in Phoenix, the KTVW call letters were once allocated to channel 13 in Tacoma, Washington, (now Nexstar Media Group-owned Fox affiliate KCPQ). Channel 33 was the only full-powered Spanish-language station in the Phoenix metropolitan area from its sign-on until July 2006, when Telemundo station KTAZ began operations in Phoenix after a license transfer with KDTP. This head start has solidified its dominance in Spanish-language television in Phoenix.\n\nKTVW-DT also operates the UniMás station for the Phoenix market on low-powered KFPH-CD (channel 35), which broadcasts on full-powered KFPH-DT (channel 13) in Flagstaff (also a part of the Phoenix market), giving it \"must-carry\" broadcast station status on satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKTVW shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 33, at 10:59 p.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34 to channel 33 for post-transition operations. Prior to the shutdown of its analog signal, the station's personnel gave information on how to connect and operate their digital converters, and then counting down the last 15 seconds.\n\nKTVW presently broadcasts ten hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with one hour each day, consisting of two half-hour newscasts at 5 and 10 p.m. seven nights a week). The station does not have any on-air weather staffers of its own, instead weather segments during KTVW's newscasts are produced by Los Angeles sister station KMEX-DT.

The village is about 18 kilometres south-west of Grafton on the banks of the Orara River along the Armidale–Grafton Road. The village is named after Thomas Coutts, a settler who established the nearby Kangaroo Creek pastoral station in 1840. Coutts is best known as being the perpetrator of a mass poisoning of Aboriginals on the Kangaroo Creek run. This occurred in late 1847 and resulted in the deaths of 23 people. Coutts was arrested and sent to Sydney for trial but the case was dismissed. He returned to the area and was able to continue acquiring pastoral properties further north.\n\nBritish occupation in the immediate vicinity around Coutts Crossing began in 1840 with the arrival of pastoral squatter William Forster. He set up a sheep station in the area which he named Purgatory due to the high level of Aboriginal resistance he encountered while taking possession of the land. He later changed the name of the station to Geergarow, which is commemorated today in the name of the main road heading west from the township of Coutts Crossing.\n\nThe village itself was established as a service centre for the local farming community in the 1860s. However, today the village is a dormitory suburb with majority of residents commuting into Grafton. Despite this, the village boasts a tavern, general store, community hall and church. Coutts Crossing Public School was established in 1913 and has 99 pupils enrolled.\n\nIn the last twenty-five years, a number of sporting and community services have been established, including tennis and squash courts as well as football and croquet grounds, a nine-hole golf course, a pre-school, a heritage centre and a combined New South Wales Rural Fire Service and State Emergency Service centre, established in 1997.\n\n"}
{"id": "2083937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083937", "title": "OpenID", "text": "OpenID\n\nOpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol. Promoted by the non-profit OpenID Foundation, it allows users to be authenticated by co-operating sites (known as relying parties, or RP) using a third-party service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc login systems, and allowing users to log into multiple unrelated websites without having to have a separate identity and password for each. Users create accounts by selecting an OpenID identity provider and then use those accounts to sign onto any website that accepts OpenID authentication. Several large organizations either issue or accept OpenIDs on their websites, according to the OpenID Foundation.\n\nThe OpenID standard provides a framework for the communication that must take place between the identity provider and the OpenID acceptor (the \"relying party\"). An extension to the standard (the OpenID Attribute Exchange) facilitates the transfer of user attributes, such as name and gender, from the OpenID identity provider to the relying party (each relying party may request a different set of attributes, depending on its requirements). The OpenID protocol does not rely on a central authority to authenticate a user's identity. Moreover, neither services nor the OpenID standard may mandate a specific means by which to authenticate users, allowing for approaches ranging from the common (such as passwords) to the novel (such as smart cards or biometrics).\n\nThe final version of OpenID is OpenID 2.0, finalized and published in December 2007. The term \"OpenID\" may also refer to an identifier as specified in the OpenID standard; these identifiers take the form of a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and are managed by some \"OpenID provider\" that handles authentication.\n\n, there are over 1 billion OpenID-enabled accounts on the Internet (see below) and approximately 1,100,934 sites have integrated OpenID consumer support: AOL, Flickr, France Telecom, Google, Amazon.com, Canonical (provider name Ubuntu One), LiveJournal, Microsoft (provider name Microsoft account), Mixi, Myspace, Novell, OpenStreetMap, Orange, Sears, Sun, Telecom Italia, Universal Music Group, VeriSign, WordPress, Yahoo!, the BBC, IBM, PayPal, and Steam, although some of those organizations also have their own authentication management.\n\nMany if not all of the larger organizations require users to provide authentication in the form of an existing email account or mobile phone number in order to sign up for an account (which then can be used as an OpenID identity). There are several smaller entities that accept sign-ups with no extra identity details required.\n\nFacebook did use OpenID in the past, but moved to Facebook Connect.\nBlogger also used OpenID, but since May 2018 no longer supports it.\n\nAn \"end-user\" is the entity that wants to assert a particular identity. A \"relying party\" (RP) is a web site or application that wants to verify the end-user's identifier. Other terms for this party include \"service provider\" or the now obsolete \"consumer\". An identity provider, or \"OpenID provider\" (OP) is a service that specializes in registering OpenID URLs or XRIs. OpenID enables an end-user to communicate with a relying party. This communication is done through the exchange of an identifier or \"OpenID\", which is the URL or XRI chosen by the end-user to name the end-user's identity. An identity provider provides the OpenID authentication (and possibly other identity services). The exchange is enabled by a \"user-agent\", which is the program (such as a browser) used by the end-user to communicate with the relying party and OpenID provider.\n\nThe end-user interacts with a relying party (such as a website) that provides an option to specify an OpenID for the purposes of authentication; an end-user typically has previously registered an OpenID (e.g. codice_1) with an OpenID provider (e.g. codice_2).\n\nThe relying party typically transforms the OpenID into a canonical URL form (e.g. codice_3).\n\nThere are two modes in which the relying party may communicate with the OpenID provider:\n\nThe codice_6 mode can fall back to the codice_7 mode if the operation cannot be automated.\n\nFirst, the relying party and the OpenID provider (optionally) establish a shared secret, referenced by an \"associate handle\", which the relying party then stores. If using the codice_7 mode, the relying party redirects the end-user's user-agent to the OpenID provider so the end-user can authenticate directly with the OpenID provider.\n\nThe method of authentication may vary, but typically, an OpenID provider prompts the end-user for a password or some cryptographic token, and then asks whether the end-user trusts the relying party to receive the necessary identity details.\n\nIf the end-user declines the OpenID provider's request to trust the relying party, then the user-agent is redirected back to the relying party with a message indicating that authentication was rejected; the relying party in turn refuses to authenticate the end-user.\n\nIf the end-user accepts the OpenID provider's request to trust the relying party, then the user-agent is redirected back to the relying party along with the end-user's credentials. That relying party must then confirm that the credentials really came from the OpenID provider. If the relying party and OpenID provider had previously established a shared secret, then the relying party can validate the identity of the OpenID provider by comparing its copy of the shared secret against the one received along with the end-user's credentials; such a relying party is called \"stateful\" because it stores the shared secret between sessions. In contrast, a \"stateless\" or \"dumb\" relying party must make one more background request (codice_11) to ensure that the data indeed came from the OpenID provider.\n\nAfter the OpenID has been verified, authentication is considered successful and the end-user is considered logged into the relying party under the identity specified by the given OpenID (e.g. codice_1). The relying party typically then stores the end-user's OpenID along with the end-user's other session information.\n\nTo obtain an OpenID-enabled URL that can be used to log into OpenID-enabled websites, a user registers an OpenID identifier with an identity provider. Identity providers offer the ability to register a URL (typically a third-level domain, e.g. username.example.com) that will automatically be configured with OpenID authentication service.\n\nOnce they have registered an OpenID, a user can also use an existing URL under their own control (such as a blog or home page) as an alias or \"delegated identity\". They simply insert the appropriate OpenID tags in the HTML or serve a Yadis document.\n\nStarting with OpenID Authentication 2.0 (and some 1.1 implementations), there are two types of identifiers that can be used with OpenID: URLs and XRIs.\n\nXRIs are a new form of Internet identifier designed specifically for cross-domain digital identity. For example, XRIs come in two forms—i-names and i-numbers—that are usually registered simultaneously as synonyms. I-names are reassignable (like domain names), while i-numbers are never reassigned. When an XRI i-name is used as an OpenID identifier, it is immediately resolved to the synonymous i-number (the CanonicalID element of the XRDS document). This i-number is the OpenID identifier stored by the relying party. In this way, both the user and the relying party are protected from the end-user's OpenID identity ever being taken over by another party as can happen with a URL based on a reassignable DNS name.\n\nThe OpenID Foundation (OIDF) promotes and enhances the OpenID community and technologies. The OIDF is a non-profit international standards development organization of individual developers, government agencies and companies who wish to promote and protect OpenID. The OpenID Foundation was formed in June 2007 and serves as a public trust organization representing an open community of developers, vendors and users. OIDF assists the community by providing needed infrastructure and help in promoting and supporting adoption of OpenID. This includes managing intellectual property and trade marks as well a fostering viral growth and global participation in OpenID.\n\nThe OpenID Foundation's board of directors has four community members and eight corporate members:\nCommunity Board Members\n\nCorporate Board Members\n\nOIDF is a global organization to promote digital identity and to encourage the further adoption of OpenID, the OIDF has encouraged the creation of member chapters. Member chapters are officially part of the Foundation and work within their own constituency to support the development and adoption of OpenID as a framework for user-centric identity on the internet.\n\nThe OIDF ensures that OpenID specifications are freely implementable therefore the OIDF requires all contributors to sign a contribution agreement. This agreement both grants a copyright license to the Foundation to publish the collective specifications and includes a patent non-assertion agreement. The non-assertion agreement states that the contributor will not sue someone for implementing OpenID specifications.\n\nThe OpenID trademark in the United States was assigned to the OpenID Foundation in March 2008. It had been registered by NetMesh Inc. before the OpenID Foundation was operational. In Europe, as of August 31, 2007, the OpenID trademark is registered to the OpenID Europe Foundation.\n\nThe OpenID logo was designed by Randy \"ydnar\" Reddig, who in 2005 had expressed plans to transfer the rights to an OpenID organization.\n\nSince the original announcement of OpenID, the official site has stated:\n\nSun Microsystems, VeriSign and a number of smaller companies involved in OpenID have issued patent non-assertion covenants covering OpenID 1.1 specifications. The covenants state that the companies will not assert any of their patents against OpenID implementations and will revoke their promises from anyone who threatens, or asserts, patents against OpenID implementors.\n\nIn March, 2012, a research paper reported two generic security issues in OpenID. Both issues allow an attacker to sign into a victim's relying party accounts. For the first issue, OpenID and Google (an Identity Provider of OpenID) both published security advisories to address it. Google's advisory says \"An attacker could forge an OpenID request that doesn't ask for the user's email address, and then insert an unsigned email address into the IDPs response. If the attacker relays this response to a website that doesn't notice that this attribute is unsigned, the website may be tricked into logging the attacker in to any local account.\" The research paper claims that many popular websites have been confirmed vulnerable, including Yahoo! Mail, smartsheet.com, Zoho, manymoon.com, diigo.com. The researchers have notified the affected parties, who have then fixed their vulnerable code.\n\nFor the second issue, the paper called it \"Data Type Confusion Logic Flaw\", which also allows attackers to sign into victim's RP accounts. Google and PayPal were initially confirmed vulnerable. OpenID published a vulnerability report on the flaw. The report says Google and PayPal have applied fixes, and suggest other OpenID vendors to check their implementations.\n\nSome observers have suggested that OpenID has security weaknesses and may prove vulnerable to phishing attacks. For example, a malicious relaying party may forward the end-user to a bogus identity provider authentication page asking that end-user to input their credentials. On completion of this, the malicious party (who in this case also controls the bogus authentication page) could then have access to the end-user's account with the identity provider, and then use that end-user's OpenID to log into other services.\n\nIn an attempt to combat possible phishing attacks some OpenID providers mandate that the end-user needs to be authenticated with them prior to an attempt to authenticate with the relying party. This relies on the end-user knowing the policy of the identity provider. In December 2008, the OpenID Foundation approved version 1.0 of the Provider Authentication Policy Extension (PAPE), which \"enables Relying Parties to request that OpenID Providers employ specified authentication policies when authenticating users and for OpenID Providers to inform the Relying Parties which policies were actually used.\"\n\nOther security issues identified with OpenID involve lack of privacy and failure to address the trust problem. However, this problem is not unique to OpenID and is simply the state of the Internet as commonly used.\n\nThe Identity Provider does, however, get a log of your OpenID logins; they know when you logged into what website, making cross-site tracking much easier. A compromised OpenID account is also likely to be a more serious breach of privacy than a compromised account on a single site.\n\nAnother important vulnerability is present in the last step in the authentication scheme when TLS/SSL are not used: the redirect-URL from the identity provider to the relying party. The problem with this redirect is the fact that anyone who can obtain this URL (e.g. by sniffing the wire) can replay it and get logged into the site as the victim user. Some of the identity providers use nonces (number used once) to allow a user to log into the site once and fail all the consecutive attempts. The nonce solution works if the user is the first one to use the URL. However, a fast attacker who is sniffing the wire can obtain the URL and immediately reset a user's TCP connection (as an attacker is sniffing the wire and knows the required TCP sequence numbers) and then execute the replay attack as described above. Thus nonces only protect against passive attackers, but cannot prevent active attackers from executing the replay attack. Use of TLS/SSL in the authentication process can significantly reduce this risk.\n\nThis can be restated as:\nOn May 1, 2014, a bug dubbed \"Covert Redirect related to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID\" was disclosed. It was discovered by mathematics doctoral student Wang Jing at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\n\nThe announcement of OpenID is:\n\"'Covert Redirect', publicized in May 2014, is an instance of attackers using open redirectors – a well-known threat, with well-known means of prevention. The OpenID Connect protocol mandates strict measures that preclude open redirectors to prevent this vulnerability.\"\n\n\"The general consensus, so far, is that Covert Redirect is not as bad, but still a threat. Understanding what makes it dangerous requires a basic understanding of Open Redirect, and how it can be exploited.\"\n\nA patch was not immediately made available. Ori Eisen, founder, chairman and chief innovation officer at 41st Parameter told Sue Marquette Poremba, \"In any distributed system, we are counting of the good nature of the participants to do the right thing. In cases like OAuth and OpenID, the distribution is so vast that it is unreasonable to expect each and every website to patch up in the near future\".\n\nThe original OpenID authentication protocol was developed in May 2005 by Brad Fitzpatrick, creator of popular community website LiveJournal, while working at Six Apart. Initially referred to as Yadis (an acronym for \"Yet another distributed identity system\"), it was named OpenID after the openid.net domain name was given to Six Apart to use for the project. OpenID support was soon implemented on LiveJournal and fellow LiveJournal engine community DeadJournal for blog post comments and quickly gained attention in the digital identity community. Web developer JanRain was an early supporter of OpenID, providing OpenID software libraries and expanding its business around OpenID-based services.\nIn late June, discussions started between OpenID users and developers from enterprise software company NetMesh, leading to collaboration on interoperability between OpenID and NetMesh's similar Light-Weight Identity (LID) protocol. The direct result of the collaboration was the Yadis discovery protocol, adopting the name originally used for OpenID. The new Yadis was announced on October 24, 2005. After a discussion at the 2005 Internet Identity Workshop a few days later, XRI/i-names developers joined the Yadis project, contributing their Extensible Resource Descriptor Sequence (XRDS) format for utilization in the protocol.\nIn December, developers at Sxip Identity began discussions with the OpenID/Yadis community after announcing a shift in the development of version 2.0 of its Simple Extensible Identity Protocol (SXIP) to URL-based identities like LID and OpenID. In March 2006, JanRain developed a Simple Registration (SREG) extension for OpenID enabling primitive profile-exchange and in April submitted a proposal to formalize extensions to OpenID. The same month, work had also begun on incorporating full XRI support into OpenID. Around early May, key OpenID developer David Recordon left Six Apart, joining VeriSign to focus more on digital identity and guidance for the OpenID spec. By early June, the major differences between the SXIP 2.0 and OpenID projects were resolved with the agreement to support multiple personas in OpenID by submission of an identity provider URL rather than a full identity URL. With this, as well as the addition of extensions and XRI support underway, OpenID was evolving into a full-fledged digital identity framework, with Recordon proclaiming \"We see OpenID as being an umbrella for the framework that encompasses the layers for identifiers, discovery, authentication and a messaging services layer that sits atop and this entire thing has sort of been dubbed 'OpenID 2.0'. \" In late July, Sxip began to merge its Digital Identity Exchange (DIX) protocol into OpenID, submitting initial drafts of the OpenID Attribute Exchange (AX) extension in August. Late in 2006, a ZDNet opinion piece made the case for OpenID to users, web site operators and entrepreneurs.\nOn January 31, 2007, Symantec announced support for OpenID in its Identity Initiative products and services. A week later, on February 6 Microsoft made a joint announcement with JanRain, Sxip, and VeriSign to collaborate on interoperability between OpenID and Microsoft's Windows CardSpace digital identity platform, with particular focus on developing a phishing-resistant authentication solution for OpenID. As part of the collaboration, Microsoft pledged to support OpenID in its future identity server products and JanRain, Sxip, and VeriSign pledged to add support for Microsoft's Information Card profile to their future identity solutions. In mid-February, AOL announced that an experimental OpenID provider service was functional for all AOL and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) accounts.\n\nIn May, Sun Microsystems began working with the OpenID community, announcing an OpenID program, as well as entering a non-assertion covenant with the OpenID community, pledging not to assert any of its patents against implementations of OpenID. In June, OpenID leadership formed the OpenID Foundation, an Oregon-based public benefit corporation for managing the OpenID brand and property. The same month, an independent OpenID Europe Foundation was formed in Belgium by Snorri Giorgetti. By early December, non-assertion agreements were collected by the major contributors to the protocol and the final OpenID Authentication 2.0 and OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0 specifications were ratified on December 5.\n\nIn mid-January 2008, Yahoo! announced initial OpenID 2.0 support, both as a provider and as a relying party, releasing the provider service by the end of the month. In early February, Google, IBM, Microsoft, VeriSign and Yahoo! joined the OpenID Foundation as corporate board members. Around early May, SourceForge, Inc. introduced OpenID provider and relying party support to leading open source software development website SourceForge.net. In late July, popular social network service MySpace announced support for OpenID as a provider. In late October, Google launched support as an OpenID provider and Microsoft announced that Windows Live ID would support OpenID. In November, JanRain announced a free hosted service, RPX Basic, that allows websites to begin accepting OpenIDs for registration and login without having to install, integrate and configure the OpenID open source libraries.\n\nIn January 2009, PayPal joined the OpenID Foundation as a corporate member, followed shortly by Facebook in February. The OpenID Foundation formed an executive committee and appointed Don Thibeau as executive director. In March, MySpace launched their previously announced OpenID provider service, enabling all MySpace users to use their MySpace URL as an OpenID. In May, Facebook launched their relying party functionality, letting users use an automatic login-enabled OpenID account (e.g. Google) to log into Facebook.\n\nIn September 2013, Janrain announced that MyOpenID.com would be shut down on February 1, 2014; a pie chart showed Facebook and Google dominate the social login space as of Q2 2013. Facebook has since left OpenID; it is no longer a sponsor, represented on the board, or permitting OpenID logins.\n\nIn May 2016, Symantec announced that they would be discontinuing their pip.verisignlabs.com OpenID personal identity portal service.\n\nIn March 2018, StackOverflow announced an end to OpenID support, citing insufficient usage to justify the cost. In the announcement, it was stated that based on activity, users strongly preferred Facebook, Google, and e-mail/password based account authentication.\n\nOpenID is a way to use a single set of user credentials to access multiple sites, while OAuth facilitates the authorization of one site to access and use information related to the user's account on another site. Although OAuth is not an authentication protocol, it can be used as part of one.\n\nAuthentication in the context of a user accessing an application tells an application who the current user is and whether or not they're present.[...]Authentication is all about the user and their presence with the application, and an internet-scale authentication protocol needs to be able to do this across network and \nsecurity boundaries.\n\nHowever, OAuth tells the application none of that. OAuth says absolutely nothing about the user, nor does it say how the user proved their presence or even if they're still there. As far as an OAuth client is concerned, it asked for a token, got a token, and eventually used that token to access some API. It doesn't know anything about who authorized the application or if there was even a user there at all. In fact, much of the point of OAuth is about giving this delegated access for use in situations where the user is not present on the connection between the client and the resource being accessed. This is great for client authorization, but it's really bad for authentication where the whole point is figuring out if the user is there or not (and who they are).\n\nThe following drawing highlights the differences between using OpenID vs. OAuth for authentication. Note that with OpenID, the process starts with the application asking the user for their identity (typically an OpenID URI), whereas in the case of OAuth, the application directly requests a limited access OAuth Token (valet key) to access the APIs (enter the house) on user's behalf. If the user can grant that access, the application can retrieve the unique identifier for establishing the profile (identity) using the APIs.\nOpenID provides a cryptographic verification mechanism that prevents the attack below against users who misuse OAuth for authentication.\n\nNote that the valet key does not describe the user in any way, it only provides limited access rights, to some house (which isn't even necessarily the user's, they just had a key). Therefore if the key becomes compromised (the user is malicious and managed to steal the key to someone else's house), then the user can impersonate the house owner to the application who requested their authenticity. If the key is compromised by any point in the chain of trust, a malicious user may intercept it and use it to impersonate user X for any application relying on OAuth2 for pseudo authentication against the same OAuth authorization server. Conversely, the notarized letter contains the user's signature, which can be checked by the requesting application against the user, so this attack is not viable.\n\nThe letter can use public-key cryptography to be authenticated. \n\nPublished in February 2014 by the OpenID Foundation, the third generation of OpenID technology, OpenID Connect, is an authentication layer that sits on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. It allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain the basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. In technical terms, OpenID Connect specifies a RESTful HTTP API, using JSON as a data format. OpenID Connect allows a range of parties, including web-based, mobile and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The OpenID Connect specification is extensible, supporting optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID providers, and session management.\n\n"}

The player's character flies starfighters, including the eponymous X-wing, for the Rebel Alliance as part of a narrative that precedes and parallels the events of \"\".\n\nDesigned by Lawrence Holland and Edward Kilham's Totally Games for LucasArts, \"X-Wing\" was one of the first games to use 3D polygon graphics for spaceships and the first non-adventure game to use the iMUSE music system. The game was updated and re-released several times, and was followed by three sequels. \"X-Wing\" was a best-seller and received critical acclaim.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a Rebel pilot fighting the Galactic Empire before and during the climactic battle of the first \"Star Wars\" film. The story consists of three tours of duty of 12 to 14 operations each; although the tours can be played out of order, operations within each tour are played linearly. Briefings, cutscenes, and in-flight messages advance the plot. Additionally, a limited edition of the game came packaged with a 96-page novella, \"The Farlander Papers\" by Rusel DeMaria, that provides story information. The novella, later made part of Prima Publishing's strategy guide, presents a pilot name Keyan Farlander as the player's character for most of the operations.\n\nProgress through the game depends on fulfilling each operation's primary objectives; if the player fails an operation, he or she can attempt it again. The initial game's storyline concludes with the player flying as Luke Skywalker in his attack against the Death Star. Two expansion packs extend the story beyond the events in \"A New Hope\", up to the establishment of the Rebel base depicted at the beginning of \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\n\nAfter choosing a pilot file to play with, the player is presented with a \"concourse\" aboard the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser \"Independence\". From here, the player can choose between flying in a proving ground, historical simulator, or tour of duty. In the proving ground, the player maneuvers a starfighter through a series of gates within a time limit. The historical simulator depicts missions not tied to the main storyline. The game's plot is advanced through tour of duty operations. When the player completes a tour of duty operation, it becomes available for replay in the historical simulator. In addition to the flight options, players can access a technical room that shows images of the game's spacecraft, and a film room for reviewing recorded flight data.\n\nAs a space flight simulator game, \"X-Wing\" puts the player at the controls of various starfighters in space combat against enemy spacecraft. Drawing some influence from \"Star Raiders\" (1979), the game is played in first-person from inside the cockpit. The initial game offered pilotable A-wing, X-wing, and Y-wing craft; the \"B-Wing\" expansion adds the B-wing as a playable vehicle.\n\nAll flight takes place in space; the player does not encounter gravity or atmospheric effects. The starfighters are equipped with recharging laser weapons and limited warheads. The player controls power allocation between lasers, deflector shields, and engines. Charging the lasers and shields slows the player's craft, giving effective power management an important role in gameplay. The player can toggle the firing mode (separate or linked) of each weapon type, and balance the shields forward, aft, or evenly.\n\nMissions types include dogfights, escorting or disabling other vessels, convoy attacks, and strikes on capital ships. During missions, the player can send orders to friendly craft. In the original floppy disk version, the player can assign other saved pilot profiles to be his or her wingman; the higher the rank of the saved profile, the better the computer-controlled wingman would perform. This was removed from subsequent releases.\n\nThe player earns points for each tour of duty mission by completing objectives and destroying enemy spacecraft. Medals and ranks are awarded for campaign progress; if the player dies in combat, his or her score and awards are lost, but campaign progress is preserved.\n\nUntil 1992, Brøderbund held the license for Star Wars computer games. When the license reverted to LucasArts, designer Lawrence Holland decided to develop a Star Wars game that took advantage of his prior experience developing World War II air combat simulators. \"X-Wing\"s game engine was one of the first to use higher-detailed 3D polygonal graphics, rather than bitmap sprites.\n\nThe game's MIDI musical score includes pieces from John Williams' \"Star Wars\" score in addition to original compositions. \"X-Wing\" is the first non-adventure game to use the iMUSE \"Interactive MUsic Streaming Engine\", although the system's level of interactivity is reduced from previous iterations. For \"X-Wing\", iMUSE provides musical cues in response to in-game events, such as the arrival of friendly or hostile ships. Music designers Michael Land, Clint Bajakian, and Peter McConnell used familiar elements of Williams' music to create these cues. The musical cues were designed to blend seamlessly with the rest of the in-game music soundtrack.\n\n\"X-Wing\" was originally released on floppy disks in February 1993. Later that year, LucasArts released the \"Imperial Pursuit\" and \"B-Wing\" expansion packs on floppy disk. A sixth tour of duty, set during the Rebel Alliance's time at Echo Base, was planned but never produced; the medals case of the game was also designed to hold a sixth campaign ribbon row and medal. Some of the material for the sixth tour of duty was later incorporated into the \"X-Wing\" special edition and also the later game \"TIE Fighter\".\n\nLucasArts released the \"\" space combat simulator in 1994. That same year, it released the \"Collector's CD-ROM Edition\" of \"X-Wing\". This edition runs on the \"TIE Fighter\" game engine, itself based on the \"X-Wing\" engine. The newer engine supports Gouraud shading and other rendering enhancements. The \"Collector's CD-ROM Edition\" includes the base game and both expansions. It also includes some adjustments to missions, redesigned cutscenes, bonus missions, and voiceovers for the mission briefings and in-game radio messages. Erik Bauersfeld, who voiced Admiral Ackbar in \"Return of the Jedi\" provided the voice for Ackbar in the game. Additionally, Clive Revill, who voiced Emperor Palpatine in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (pre-2004 version), portrayed Admiral Dodonna. Owners of a floppy disk version could send payment and the back of their instruction manual to LucasArts and receive a special \"Gold Edition\" of the CD-ROM version, which included the game on a golden CD-ROM and a free gift.\n\nIn 1998, LucasArts released the \"X-Wing Collector Series Edition\". This product again changed the game engine, this time to the engine behind \"\". This update added 3D hardware acceleration and texture mapping to the game engine, and further changed some of the visuals before and during operation briefings. The game was designed to run under Windows 9x rather than DOS. Additionally, the MIDI-based iMUSE soundtrack was replaced with looping Red Book audio recordings of the \"Star Wars\" score.\n\nOn October 28, 2014, \"X-Wing\" along with \"TIE Fighter\" were released digitally for the first time. Both the original DOS and Windows editions were included, with updates to run on modern PCs.\n\n\"Star Wars: X-Wing\" was a commercial hit that surpassed the predictions of LucasArts. Its launch shipment of 100,000 units sold out during its debut weekend; nearly 500,000 units in total were ordered by retailers by December 1993.\n\n\"X-Wing\", which one author later stated \"skillfully captured the feel\" of the \"Star Wars\" films, was a best-seller in 1993. In its 1992 preview of the game \"Computer Gaming World\" wrote that the developers \"are taking aim at Chris Roberts and his megahit \"Wing Commander\" series\". The magazine said in its 1993 review that some of the missions were imbalanced, and criticized the need to identify and execute precise \"solutions\" to them. It praised the flight model as \"excellently executed and a joy to play\", however, and concluded \"I enjoyed the experience tremendously\" and looked forward to expansion disks and sequels. A 1994 survey in the magazine later gave the game four stars out of five, stating that it was \"A superb rendition of the Star Wars universe, albeit victory conditions in the scenarios are a bit too structured and rigid\". \"Compute!\" said \"X-Wing\" succeeds at being \"the first authentic space-combat simulator\", comparing it favorably to the contemporaneous \"Wing Commander\", while calling the game's rigid structure, leaving no margin for error, \"controversial\". A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" said \"X-Wing\" \"was a deserved, runaway hit\", and scored the Macintosh conversion four out of five stars. He praised the updating of the graphics with texture mapping, light sourcing, and higher resolution, as well as the inclusion of the Imperial Pursuit and B-Wing expansion packs. He criticized that the game's infamously rigid difficulty had not been fixed in the Macintosh version, but found it an overall welcome port of an outstanding game. In the following month's issue, \"Next Generation\" ranked \"X-Wing\" and \"\" collectively as number 23 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\".\n\nIn 1994 \"Computer Gaming World\" stated that \"B-Wing\" was a better value than \"Imperial Pursuit\" but \"To the avid \"X-Wing\" disciple both expansion disks should be considered must-buy products\".\n\n\"X-Wing\" was named the best \"general simulation\" of 1993 by \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\". It also received awards for \"Simulation of the Year\" from \"Computer Gaming World\" (with \"World Circuit\"), \"Best Simulation of 1993\" from \"Computer Game Review\", and \"Best Game of 1993\" from \"Electronic Entertainment\". In 1994 \"X-Wing\" won the Origins Award for \"Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1993\", and \"PC Gamer US\" named \"X-Wing\" the 5th best computer game ever. The editors wrote, \"For high-tech dog-fighting action, nothing can touch \"X-Wing\".\" That year \"PC Gamer UK\" named it the second best computer game of all time, calling it \"the only game of its type that we constantly find ourselves coming back to\". In 1995 \"PC Gamer US\" presented \"X-Wing Collector's CD-ROM\" with its 1994 \"Best CD-ROM Enhancement\" award. The editors wrote, \"This is enhancement above and beyond the call of duty, and sets the new standard by which all future CD editions will be judged.\" The \"Collector's CD-ROM\" was also named one of the top 50 CD-ROMs of 1996 by \"MacUser\".\n\n\"GameSpot\" called \"X-Wing\" \"one of the best\" \"Star Wars\" games and an example of how immersive a game can be; they specifically praised the game's graphics, attention to detail, audio, and story. The Keyan Farlander character later appears in two New Jedi Order books, and Hasbro in 2008 created a Keyan Farlander action figure. He also appears as a B-Wing pilot in the \"Star Wars: X-Wing\" and \"Star Wars: Armada\" miniatures games produced by Fantasy Flight Games.\n\n"}
{"id": "2083964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083964", "title": "Let's Scare Jessica to Death", "text": "Let's Scare Jessica to Death\n\nLet's Scare Jessica to Death is a 1971 American horror film co-written and directed by John Hancock in his directorial debut, and starring Zohra Lampert, Barton Heyman, Gretchen Corbett, and Mariclare Costello. The film depicts the nightmarish experiences of a psychologically fragile woman who comes to believe that another strange, mysterious young woman she has let into her home may actually be a vampire.\n\nInitially conceived by writer Lee Kalcheim as a satirical horror film about a group of hippies preyed upon by a monster in a lake, the screenplay was significantly reworked after director Hancock signed on to the project. Hancock took certain elements from Kalcheim's script, but opted to write a straightforward horror film set at a remote farmhouse. Inspired by the psychological implications of Henry James' novella \"The Turn of the Screw\" and Robert Wise's film \"The Haunting\" (1963), Hancock wanted to center the screenplay on a protagonist whose credibility interpreting events could be questioned by the audience so they could use their imagination. Filming of \"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" took place in various towns and villages in Connecticut, largely in Middlesex County.\n\nThough completed without a distributor, the film was purchased by Paramount Pictures, who gave it a wide release in the United States in late August 1971. The film received middling reviews from critics at the time, with some remarking the atmosphere and performances, while others criticized the sparse and ambiguous narrative. Though criticism of the film has been divided, it went on to attain a cult following, and some film scholars have drawn comparisons to Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's novel \"Carmilla\" (1871). In 2006, the Chicago Film Critics Association pronounced \"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" one of the scariest films ever made. The film was difficult to obtain on home media formats for several decades, available only on VHS until 2006, when Paramount issued a DVD version. A Blu-ray was released by Scream Factory in January 2020.\n\nJessica (Zohra Lampert) has been released from a mental institution to the care of her husband, Duncan (Barton Heyman), who has given up his job as string bassist for the New York Philharmonic and purchased a rundown farmhouse on an island in upstate New York. When Jessica, Duncan, and their hippie friend Woody (Kevin O'Connor) arrive, they are surprised to find a mysterious drifter, Emily (Mariclare Costello), already living there. When Emily offers to move on, Jessica invites her to dine with them and stay the night.\n\nThe following day, Jessica, seeing how attracted Woody is to Emily, asks Duncan to invite her to stay indefinitely. Jessica begins hearing voices and sees a mysterious young blonde woman (Gretchen Corbett) looking at her from a distance before disappearing. Later, Jessica is grabbed by someone under the water in the cove while she is swimming. Jessica is afraid to talk about these things with Duncan or Woody, for fear that they will think she is relapsing. She also becomes aware that Duncan seems to be attracted to Emily, and that the men in the nearby town, all of whom are bandaged in some way, are hostile towards them.\n\nDuncan and Jessica decide to sell antiques found in the house at a local shop, one of which is a silver-framed portrait of the house's former owners, the Bishop family—father, mother, and daughter Abigail. The antique dealer, Sam Dorker (Alan Manson), tells them the story of how Abigail drowned in 1880 just before her wedding day. Legend claims that she is still alive, roving the island as a vampire. Jessica finds the story fascinating, but Duncan, afraid that hearing about such things will upset his wife, cuts Dorker short. Later, as Jessica prepares to make a headstone rubbing on Abigail Bishop's grave, she notices the blonde woman beckoning her to follow. The woman leads Jessica to a cliff, at the bottom of which lies Dorker's bloodied body. By the time Jessica finds Duncan, however, the body is gone. Jessica and Duncan spot the woman standing on the cliff above them, causing Duncan to give chase. When the woman is caught and questioned by the couple, she remains silent and quickly flees when Emily approaches.\n\nThat night, Duncan tells Jessica that she needs to return to New York to resume her psychiatric treatment. Jessica forces him to sleep on the couch, where he is seduced by Emily. The next day, Jessica finds the portrait of the Bishop family, which she and Duncan had sold to Dorker the previous day, back in the attic; she observes that Abigail Bishop, as seen on the photo, bears a striking resemblance to Emily. Jessica agrees to go with Emily to swim in the cove. While swimming, Emily vanishes from sight; Jessica hears Emily's voice in her head and watches as Emily emerges from the lake in a wedding gown. Emily attempts to bite her neck, but Jessica flees, locking herself in her bedroom in the house. Hours pass and Jessica leaves to hitch a ride into town. Woody, who has been working in the orchard, returns to the house, where Emily bites his neck.\n\nWhen Jessica gets into town, she sees Duncan's car and asks about his whereabouts, but no one will speak to her; she then encounters Sam Dorker, and terrified, runs back to the house. She collapses in the orchard and later is found by Duncan, who takes her home. In their bedroom, the couple go to lie down; Jessica notices a cut on Duncan's neck, and Emily then enters the room brandishing a knife, with the townsmen following behind her. Jessica flees the house, knocking over Duncan's bass case, which contains the corpse of the mute woman.\n\nJessica runs through the orchard and comes across Woody's corpse, his throat slashed. At daybreak, Jessica makes it to the ferry and tries to board, but the ferryman refuses to let her on. She jumps into a nearby rowboat and paddles out into the lake. When a hand reaches into the boat from the water, she stabs the person in the back several times with a pole hook. As the body floats away, she sees that it is Duncan. From the shore, Emily and the townsmen watch her.\n\nSome literature and film scholars have drawn comparisons between \"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" and Irish novelist Sheridan Le Fanu's novel \"Carmilla\" (1871), which tells the story of a vampiress. Scholar Nancy West cites the film as one of several examples of horror films of the 1970s that directly lift the premise of the novel and place it in other historical or cultural contexts: \"This languid movie reimagines Le Fanu's Laura as Jessica...like Carmilla, Emily is a horror of a houseguest, and after both men have been bitten by her, it becomes apparent that Emily is none other than the one-hundred-year-old vampire who in the course of time has attacked all the men in the nearby town...Is Emily an imaginative projection of Jessica's murderous feelings toward her husband? Of Jessica's frustration with a mental condition that has rendered her sadly dependent on men? The film never makes clear.\"\n\nThe decline of 1960s counterculture has been cited as a theme by critics and observers. The hearse that Duncan and Jessica drive, which has with the word \"love\" spray-painted on it, has been noted as a blatant reference to the death of \n\"hippie values.\" Critic and biographer Michael Doyle describes the film as a \"haunting elegy\" for the failures of the hippie movement. Doyle elaborates that the film \"isolates and illuminates the death and corruption of counterculture values\" from the era, and anticipates the \"festering paranoia\" that occurred throughout the 1970s, with the Watergate scandal, the assassinations of Harvey Milk and George Moscone, and the Jonestown massacre. Director John Hancock, though ambivalent about whether it was consciously or subconsciously integrated into the screenplay, has conceded this interpretation, commenting: \"You could already feel that negativity brewing when we were making \"Jessica\"; that things weren't working out the way some of us had hoped and dreamed they would.\"\n\nAccording to Lee Kalcheim, the original script for the film was far different from the completed film. Hired by producer Charles B. Moss, Kalcheim's original screenplay, entitled It Drinks Hippie Blood, followed a group of hippies camping on a cove who are attacked by a creature that lives in the water. Kalcheim described his screenplay as a satire: \"John [Hancock] turned-the-screw so to speak making it a serious, darker theme. The simplicity of the film worked perfectly to create a scary mood.\"\n\nHancock agreed to direct the film only as long as he was allowed to redraft the screenplay, and proceeded to rework Kalcheim's original script in both tone and thematic content, but retained certain elements at the request of the producers; the mute girl, played by Gretchen Corbett, for example, was a character from Kalcheim's original script that Moss requested Hancock retain in his redraft. The scene in which the group attempt a séance was also requested to be kept in the film by both Kalcheim and the producers. Hancock stated that \"the scenes didn't make much sense to me, but the Mosses felt they would be particularly enjoyable and scary. I trusted their instincts because they had a concrete experience of audiences.\" Kalcheim is credited as a co-writer on the film under the pseudonym Norman Jonas. Certain elements of the film were drawn from Hancock's own life, such as the apple orchard settings and farmhouse, as he had grown up on an apple orchard, as well as Norman's career as a bassist, as Hancock's father was a professional double-bass player.\n\nIn writing the role of Jessica, Hancock sought to create a filmic equivalent to the unreliable narrator in literary fiction. Jessica was partly influenced by the governess in Henry James's novella \"The Turn of the Screw\", as well as the character of Eleanor Lance in Robert Wise's film \"The Haunting\" (1963). The theme of evil pervading the protagonist's mind was central: \"I was alarmed by the notion that you can't defeat or defuse evil—it forever lives inside and all around us—so I worked that fear inside the story,\" said Hancock.\n\nHancock, who had worked as a theater director prior, cast the film largely through his connections within the New York theater community, and the majority of the cast consisted of actors with whom Hancock had worked in stage productions. Auditions for the parts were held in the B.S. Moss Offices on Broadway in New York City. Actress Zohra Lampert was cast in the lead role of Jessica, the titular character who finds herself questioning her sanity. She was approached by Hancock, her former boyfriend, while performing in a Broadway production of \"Mother Courage and Her Children\" with Anne Bancroft. \"I accepted, trusting his judgement,\" Lampert recalled. \"I have a great fondness for John Hancock, and enjoyed working with him very much.\" Lampert \"got lost in her character\" as the script resonated with her, and she spent much of her time between takes remaining in character. Hancock recalled of her casting: \"I knew she would be perfect for the lead role. Zohra could play the fragility of the character, but she could also authentically convey the fear and the terror.\"\n\nMariclare Costello, an actress who had worked as a casting director on Hancock's stage production of \"The Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake\" (1967), was cast opposite Lampert as the mysterious hippie, Emily. Hancock was specifically taken by Costello's physical features, which included bright red hair and a pale complexion, which he felt was befitting of the vampiric Emily. Barton Heyman and Kevin O'Connor were given the roles of Jessica's husband Duncan, and the couple's friend Woody, respectively; Hancock had worked with Heyman and O'Connor previously, as they had appeared in his 1967–1968 stage production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Heyman had been Hancock's first choice in the role of Duncan. Alan Mason, who portrayed the doomed antique dealer Sam Dorker, had also acted in several of Hancock's plays. Gretchen Corbett, also an established New York-based stage actress from Portland, Oregon, was cast as the mysterious mute girl whom Jessica encounters, and was the only performer in the principal cast to have not worked with Hancock prior.\n\nIn preparation, both Lampert and Costello worked with acting coach Mira Rostova for their respective roles in the film. To prepare the performers for the tone he hoped to accomplish, Hancock screened several films by Alfred Hitchcock to the cast prior to filming.\n\n\"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" was filmed over a period of 26 days in the fall of 1970, in various towns in Connecticut; the production budget was $250,000. Principal photography began in November of that year in Old Saybrook. The exteriors of the house were shot at a farmhouse in Old Saybrook, while the E.E. Dickinson Mansion, located in the village of Essex, was used for the interior shots of the home. While shooting, the cast and crew used multiple rooms in the expansive mansion for dressing rooms and a headquarters for the film company.\n\nAdditional photography occurred in the villages of Chester, Lyme, and East Haddam. The Chester–Hadlyme Ferry is featured in the film crossing the Connecticut River. Co-producer William Badalato had suggested the location: \"My wife and I had a weekend house in Chester, Connecticut. We loved the area and shared our feelings with John [Hancock] and [producer Charles B. Moss Jr.] After a preliminary scout we all agree that this was where \"Jessica\" should be filmed.\"\n\nBadalato recalled of Hancock's direction: \"He was always responsible to our budget and was very confident with the actors. He felt close to the material as it spoke to him in some bizarre way. John actually used to take his own pulse while he was shooting and I was completely intrigued by this.\" Because the film was shot in the fall months, the sequences that were shot in the lake required the actors to swim in very cold water. The scene in which Costello's character emerges from the lake in a wedding dress was filmed in late November on a day in which it had snowed.\n\n\"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" was one of the first horror films to prominently feature a synthesizer in its musical score, which was composed by Orville Stoeber. The song sung by Costello's character was initially going to be dubbed by a professional singer, but Hancock and the producers decided to keep her voice as it was recorded.\n\nFilmed without a distributor and produced independently (under The Jessica Company), \"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" was sold to Paramount Pictures in early 1971. Frank Yablans, then an executive at Paramount, devised the film's title as they felt Hancock's working title, which was simply Jessica, was not commercially viable. Paramount gave the film a wide theatrical release in the United States. It premiered in New York City on August 27, 1971, and opened in Los Angeles, California the following week, on September 1, 1971. Fake plastic vampire fangs were given to patrons at some cinemas in promotion of the film, while a horse-drawn hearse and coffins were parked in front of Manhattan's Criterion Theatre during the film's opening week. During its opening week of August 27–September 1 at the Criterion, the film grossed a total of $47,651.\n\nContemporaneous\nUpon its release, Stanley Kanfer of \"Time\" gave the film a middling review, praising Lampert's performance but dismissing the rest of the cast's, adding that \"after the first reel, the vampires seem to have lost their bite.\" Roger Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" also praised Lampert's performance and lauded the film, calling it a \"thinking man's vampire movie, probably a secret dream for at least half the world's young filmmakers.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" remarked the \"strong sense of atmosphere\" in the film in addition to the four lead performances, who are \"likable, believable people,\" but conceded: \"There's no getting around the movie's poorly resolved script.\" \"The San Francisco Examiner\"s Stanley Eichelbaum also noted deficiencies in the screenplay, noting that the film \"seems improvised and nothing could be worse for this kind of structured suspense thriller. Hancock's direction is ridiculously disjointed and inconsistent.\" This sentiment was echoed by Kevin Kelly of \"The Boston Globe\", who felt the film contained so many idiosyncrasies that \"nothing rings true.\"\n\nJack Meredith of the \"Windsor Star\" described the film as a \"far-out bit of froth\" that \"nevertheless packs continuing suspense and a what's-going-to-happen-next element that never lets down through about 1½ hours of sustained action.\" Writing for the \"Edmonton Journal\", Barry Westgate was critical of the film, noting: \"Even contrived cinema has to have its share of rhyme or reason, and this effort by John Hancock doesn't have so much as a touch of either.\" Ann Guarino of the \"New York Daily News\" commented on the film's ambiguous plot, writing that it \"presents the problem and leaves you to solve it...  The film may not take the curl out of your hair, but it will hold your interest even if the title will throw you off—there actually is no plot to scare Jessica.\" She also praised the performances of Lampert and Costello, as well as those of Heyman and O'Connor, but noted of the latter that their \"characters are not well developed by the script.\" The \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\"s Donald Miller wrote that \"after the first ten minutes...  I thought director John Hancock...  was onto something—if not a new genre, then perhaps something as arresting as \"the Cat People\",\" but felt that it devolved into a \"routine vampire romp,\" though he did praise the cinematography and visuals.\n\nModern\nContemporary critical reviews of the film have been mixed: Film scholar John Stanley gave the film a favorable review in his 1995 book, writing: \"Director John Hancock is to be congratulated for a multi-layered horror film with frightening visuals. There isn't much logic to the story, yet the overall effect is unsettling... the film has a dream-like quality.\" AllMovie deemed it an \"eerie low-budget chiller.\" Film scholar Gary A. Smith remarked Lampert's performance as Jessica as \"laid back to the point of somnambulism. Lampert gives a performance so overwrought that it has to rank as one of the most eccentric ever captured on film.\"\n\nIn 2006, Eric Henderson of \"Slant\" gave the film an unfavorable review, writing: \"A lesbian panic melodrama in New England gothic drag, the only things separating \"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" from its cinematic descendants are its narrative incoherence, its lack of a directorial presence (especially surprising considering the colloquial implications of the director's name), [and] its drab, douche commercial mise-en-scène.\" Author and independent filmmaker John Kenneth Muir gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising the film's cinematography, \"unsettling\" mood, and its ability to generate a sense of unease, calling it \"very disturbing\" and noting its \"lovely and poetic\" visuals. Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2 out of a possible 4 stars, calling it \"creepy.\"\n\nIn a 2013 article published by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, Erik Luers wrote of the film: \"The technical qualities of \"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" are superb. With gorgeous cinematography and an audio track that takes on a life of its own, each sound and image presents a hazy version of reality. As the plot develops, we learn that the world around Jessica is scarier than anything her mind could concoct.\" Genre scholar Kim Newman has praised the film, specifically Lampert's performance, which he ranks as equal to those of Gena Rowlands in \"A Woman Under the Influence\" (1974), Carrie Snodgress in \"Diary of a Mad Housewife\" (1970), Shirley Knight in \"The Rain People\" (1969), and Susannah York in \"Images\" (1972), all \"portrait[s] of a woman in distress.\"\n\nThe film was released on VHS and Beta by Paramount Pictures in 1984, but later went out of print and was difficult to obtain. Paramount released the film on DVD on August 29, 2006, and reissued it on September 15, 2009. Warner Brothers later released the film on August 27, 2013, through its Warner Archive DVD-on-demand service. On July 20, 2019, Scream Factory announced at San Diego Comic-Con that they would be issuing the film on Blu-ray, marking its debut in this format. The Blu-ray was released on January 28, 2020 and includes a commentary track from director John D. Hancock and producer Phil Badalato, interviews with composer Orville Stoeber and historian Kim Newman, a documentary on the filming locations, and other bonus features.\n\n\"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" has been named one of the scariest films of all time by several critical publications: In 2006, the Chicago Film Critics Association pronounced \"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\" the 87th scariest film ever made. According to Steve Senski of \"Trailers from Hell\", \"Twilight Zone\" creator Rod Serling called the film \"one of the most frightening films he'd ever seen in his life.\" Film scholar Kim Newman, as well as fiction writers Charles L. Grant and Stephen King, are among those who have named it one of their favorite horror films.\n\nSara Century, writing for Syfy, noted the significance of the film: \"While the response is entirely subjective and it isn’t a film for everyone, \"Jessica\" did in many ways serve as a forerunner for what would come later, as filmmakers like David Lynch would delve into dreamscapes that refused to sustain themselves explicitly in cohesive narratives. As with many movies, the tone of \"Jessica\" is what matters, and that is indeed where it succeeds.\" In the early 2010s, London's \"Time Out\" conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films, who ranked the film number 86 in a list of 100 films.\n\n"}

{"id": "2083990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083990", "title": "Little Iliad", "text": "Little Iliad\n\nThe Little Iliad (Greek: , \"Ilias mikra\"; ) is a lost epic of ancient Greek literature. It was one of the Epic Cycle, that is, the Trojan cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The story of the \"Little Iliad\" comes chronologically after that of the \"Aethiopis\", and is followed by that of the \"Iliou persis\" (\"Sack of Troy\"). The \"Little Iliad\" was variously attributed by ancient writers to Lesches of Pyrrha (7th century BCE), Cinaethon of Sparta (8th century BCE), Diodorus of Erythrae, Thestorides of Phocaea, or Homer himself (8th century BCE) (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised four books of verse in dactylic hexameter, the heroic meter.\n\nThe \"Little Iliad\" was probably composed in the latter half of the seventh century BCE, but there is much uncertainty. Ancient sources date Lesches to the seventh century; but it is typical for ancient writers to place archaic literary authors earlier (sometimes centuries earlier) than the period they actually lived.\n\nThe \"Little Iliad\" is one of the better-attested epics in the Epic Cycle: nearly thirty lines of the original text survive. Nevertheless, we are almost entirely dependent on a summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the \"Chrestomatheia\" attributed to an unknown Proclus (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century CE grammarian Eutychius Proclus). Numerous other references give indications of the poem's storyline.\n\nThe poem, \"a fast-paced episodic epic with a lot of ground to cover\" — which opened it to Aristotle's criticism that it had more plot than an epic should have — opens with the judgment of Achilles's arms, which are to be awarded to the greatest Greek hero: the contest is between Ajax and Odysseus, who recovered Achilles's body in battle. With the help of Athena, the arms are awarded to Odysseus, and Ajax goes insane and attacks the Achaeans' herd. Later, in shame, he commits suicide, and is buried without full heroic honours, in a coffin rather than cremated on a funeral pyre, \"because of the anger of the king\", Agamemnon.\n\nCalchas, the Greek prophet, prophesies that the city of Troy will not fall unless the Greeks recover the arrows of Heracles from the hero Philoctetes, who was left behind on Lemnos when he was bitten by a poisonous snake. In accordance with this prophecy, Odysseus and Diomedes go to Lemnos to bring back Philoctetes, who is healed of his wound by Machaon. Philoctetes then fights Paris in single combat and kills him. After Paris's death, Helenus and Deiphobus fight over Helen. Deiphobus wins and marries her. The defeated Helenus angrily abandons Troy in spite and moves to Mount Ida.\n\nOdysseus, who is a recurrent figure of interest in the \"Little Iliad\", ambushes Helenus and captures him; Helenus then reveals three new prophecies concerning the preconditions for the Greeks' conquest of Troy, notably, that the city will not fall while it harbours the Palladium. The other two conditions are that the bones of Pelops are recovered from Pisa, a rival of Elis, and that Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, is brought into the war.\n\nWhile a ship of Mycenaeans sail to Pisa to bring back the bones of Pelops, Odysseus brings Achilles's son Neoptolemus to Troy, gives him his father's armor. Achilles's ghost appears to him. When the Trojan ally Eurypylus dominates the field in battle, Neoptolemus kills him.\n\nOdysseus and Diomedes go into Troy disguised as beggars, where Helen recognises them but keeps their secret; they return safely with the Palladium, killing some Trojans on the way.\n\nOn the goddess Athena's initiative, the Greek warrior Epeius builds the wooden horse, and the Greeks place their best warriors inside it, burn their camp, and withdraw to the nearby island Tenedos. The Trojans, believing that the Greeks have departed for good, breach a section of their city wall to bring the horse inside, and celebrate their apparent victory.\n\nThe emergence of the heroes from the horse, and the Greeks' destruction of Troy, seem not to be recounted in the \"Little Iliad\", but are left for the \"Iliou persis\". Nonetheless, a substantial fragment which is securely attributed to the \"Little Iliad\" describes how Neoptolemus takes Hector's wife Andromache captive and kills Hector's baby son, Astyanax, by throwing him from the walls of the city.\n\nThe \"Little Iliad\" does not seem to have been redacted in a single, authoritative version, according to varying accounts of its details that cannot securely be harmonised.\n\n"}

Exemplars of \"izbu\" compendia first appear in the old Babylonian period but it is not until the late second millennium that it is thought to have reached canonical form and exemplars of teratomantic texts from this era have been found in Assur and Babylon as well as further afield in Susa, Emar, Ugarit and Ḫattuša. The most complete form of the text comes from copies in the library of Ashurbanipal.\n\nIt was one of the works cited by the astrologer Marduk-šāpik-zēri as evidence of his learning in his letter to Aššur-bāni-apli in search of employment. Its esoteric nature was emphasized by the royal astrologer Balasi, in his letter to the same king:\n\nIn common with other works of omens, each clause is formed from a protasis giving the antecedent and an apodosis giving the consequence. In common with the Sakikkū (SA.GIG), it arranges the malformations \"ištu muḫḫi adi šēpi\", “from head to foot,” and in the color sequence: white, black, red, green–yellow, and variegated. Some of the tablets focus on malformations of single body parts, such as horns (tablet 9), eyes (tablet 10) and ears (tablet 11) and others record the behavior of adult animals as well as their offspring, such as tablet 22 which begins treating with the birth of piglets of monstrous shape (\"kūbu\") and then goes on to describe the behavioral anomalies in sows, pigs in general, and wild boars.\n\nThe series includes omens of public apodoses (mostly tablets 1–17), “If a woman gives birth, and at birth (the child) is already as white as alabaster—end of the reign; omen of a despotic king,” and private apodoses (mostly tablets 18–24), “If a woman gives birth to an ecstatic [\"maḫḫu\"], male or female, she has been impregnated in the street by a sinful man.” The sinful man being one who has leprosy (\"garbānu\") or dropsy (\"male mê\"). For the most part, private omens concerned the fortunes of the \"bēl bīti\", head of a household, or the owner of a flock or herd and related to life and death, health, general condition, relationship with the gods, social status, family and economic circumstances. “If a woman gives birth to a dog: the owner of the house will die, and his house will be scattered; the land will go mad; pestilence.” For public omens, the subject might relate to the king and his immediate family, or more generally the country as a whole, “There will be bad times. The mother will bar her door against her daughter; there will be no [sense of] brotherhood.”\n\nThe work follows the common left-right polarity, where right is generally auspicious, left not so, where for example a deformity to the right ear is bad, to the left ear is good and two right ears are good whereas two left ears are perceived to be bad. The work shares much in common with some of the \"izbu\" omens in the Šumma ālu series, from which it may have borrowed, or alternatively provided a source for these “unprovoked” omens. A late Babylonian commentary relates some of the omens to astrological observations:\n"}

{"id": "2084005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084005", "title": "National Library of Peru", "text": "National Library of Peru\n\nThe National Library of Peru () is the national library of Peru, located in Lima. It is the country's oldest and most important library. Like the majority of Peruvian libraries, it is a non-circulating library. It has two branches. The old building is on Abancay Avenue (Lima District) and the modern building is on Javier Prado Avenue (San Borja District). Both are open to the public.\n\nThe library was founded by José de San Martín in 1821, after he donated his collection of books and praised the new library as: \"... one of the most efficient mediums to place into circulation our intellectual values.\" The library has various duties, among which it must formulate, conduct, supervise, and evaluate the fulfillment of policies and plans of development of library service within a national and international sphere for educational purposes. These and other administrative decisions concerning the library also depend on the ministry of education of the country.\n\nHistorically, the library has passed through various phases of restructuring since its foundation. During the War of the Pacific, the Chilean army, after taking Lima, ransacked various items along with much capital stock from the library. Peruvian author and scholar Ricardo Palma, who was director of the library in 1884, noted in one of his recounts that of the 56,000 works the library possessed before the war, only 378 were left at the end of the occupation. In 2007, 3,778 books were returned to Peru from Chile. There are current talks between the director of the library and Chilean authorities on identifying works which might belong to Peru that would be eventually returnable. Another significant event the library has gone through was a fire which almost completely destroyed the grounds of the library on May 10, 1943, in which various highly valued historical works were lost. A new building was erected on the same grounds of the old library along with a training center for future librarian administrators.\n\nThe National Library of Peru is currently undergoing a modernization program which aspires to turn the library into one of Latin America's most modern libraries. It is located in Lima's San Borja district. After years of financial planning for the new building, the government of Peru financially collaborated to finish the building, along with a loan of up to seven million dollars from Spain to equip the new library with modern equipment. According to official sources from the library, it is said to have a bibliographic patrimony valued at around 400 million dollars. Among historical works the library has is the first book printed in Lima in 1584 along with other historical books dating back to colonial times. The new library will also attempt to connect to other Peruvian libraries in an effort to create an online national catalog of books and other materials for better research.\n\nThe new library was officially inaugurated on March 27, 2006. To mark the occasion, the then Minister of Education, Javier Sota Nadal, commissioned a symphonic poem from Peruvian composer Jimmy Lopez. The work titled, \"America Salvaje\", is inspired by the poem \"Blasón\" by José Santos Chocano. President Alejandro Toledo and National Library director Sinesio López were present at the inauguration.\n\nThe National Library (Biblioteca Nacional) is the head of the Sistema Nacional de Bibliotecas (SNB) del Perú.\n\n\n"}

As the Soviet-US Committee failed in 1946, a faction within the People's Party called \"forty-eighters\" left the party and formed the Workers Party of South Korea (남조선로동당), in a coalition with Communist Party of South Korea (조선공산당) and New People's Party (신민당).

{"id": "2084008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084008", "title": "Hotel (1967 film)", "text": "Hotel (1967 film)\n\nHotel is a 1967 American Technicolor film adaptation of the novel of the same name written by Arthur Hailey. The film stars Rod Taylor, Catherine Spaak, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Michael Rennie, Merle Oberon, and Melvyn Douglas. It is directed by Richard Quine.\n\nThe story takes place at the fictional St Gregory Hotel in New Orleans, owned by Warren Trent.\n\nThe hotel is in financial trouble. Hotel manager Peter McDermott involves himself in the proposals from three potential buyers of the property. He also takes a romantic interest in Jeanne Rochefort, the beautiful French mistress of one of the bidders, and deals with a wide range of routine problems, including a faulty elevator.\n\nJeanne is the mistress of Curtis O'Keefe, who intends to renovate and \"modernize\" the hotel, with conveyor belts carrying luggage automatically around the building as if it were some sort of modern airport terminal, and even presenting the customer's bill on a conveyor belt. While this is O'Keefe's vision for a hotel of the future, his immediate plans for the St. Gregory are different: He would remove the fountain in the center of the lobby and replace it with a circular news stand and bookstore; he would remove the comfortable lobby seating, forcing guests to go to a restaurant or lounge and spend money to sit; he would change the mezzanine promenade with rows of little shops; and he would chop up the great suites into smaller guest rooms.\n\nAmong the guests at the hotel are the Duke and Duchess of Lanbourne, a wealthy couple hiding out after fleeing from an accident in their car. A hotel detective, Dupere, attempts to blackmail the Duke and Duchess. The Duchess responds by asking Dupere to drive the car from the accident to Washington D.C. for $25,000 ($ today), but he gets caught outside of the city.\n\nKeycase, a professional thief, is working the hotel using a range of techniques and some female accomplices. In the beginning of the film he picks up a discarded key found in an ashtray at the airport. During the course of the film he sneaks into hotel rooms and steals the guests' money, but now that they can buy things by credit card, he finds that most of the guests carry very little cash.\n\nMeanwhile, a black couple, Dr. Elmo Adams and his wife, attempt to rent a room at the St. Gregory, having previously made a reservation. However, Trent tells the assistant manager filling in for McDermott (McDermott having been offered a sexual liaison with Jeanne at his French Quarter apartment) not to allow them accommodation. The Adamses are denied their room, the couple then disappear only to be followed by a man with a camera. When McDermott finds out he berates Trent for doing something that would jeopardize the preferred bid, from a union that will maintain the style – and jobs – of the St. Gregory. After tracking them down to another hotel, McDermott offers the couple their room back, but when he goes to pick them up, they have already left the hotel. After contacting the NAACP, they inform McDermott that they had not had anything planned (yet) for the St. Gregory in terms of pushing to allow blacks to check into the hotel. The couple then winds up in a Washington newspaper, damaging both O'Keefe's deal and the alternate deal with the union, leaving only the option of selling the hotel to a buyer who plans to destroy it and build an office tower.\n\nO'Keefe makes a final offer on the hotel and asks Trent, who brings McDermott along, to hear it. During the meeting, McDermott gets a call revealing that \"Dr.\" Elmo Adams is not a doctor after all and actually works as an employee for an O'Keefe Hotel in Philadelphia. McDermott also reveals that O'Keefe offered him $20,000 ($ today) to convince Trent to take the deal, and implies that Rochefort slept with him so that he wouldn't be at the hotel to properly handle the arrival of the black guests. Hotel owner Trent decides to reject the unscrupulous O'Keefe's offer and sell the St. Gregory to the man who will demolish it.\n\nKeycase's luck changes when he blithely talks himself out of one tough spot by grabbing an ordinary-looking attache case, which belongs to the Duke and Duchess. He gets to a room, calms his pounding heart, and uses one of his key collection to open the case to see what it contains. The case is filled with the cash to pay off Dupere. Counting himself lucky, Keycase heads for the elevator to leave.\nIn the elevator, Keycase is joined by the Duke and other guests. The elevator stops between floors as the control relays and emergency brakes begin to fail. McDermott and his assistant manager take the adjacent elevator to the same level and transfer passengers through the roof. The Duke and Keycase are the last two in the failing car. Keycase refuses to leave his briefcase, which contains the stolen money. The Duke is able to wrestle the case away and help Keycase out of the car, but right then the brakes completely fail, sending the Duke to his death.\n\nThe Duchess tells police she was responsible for the auto accident, hoping to save her late husband's reputation. She also saves Dupere by denying that any blackmail had occurred. The police detectives, seeing through the ruse, decide not to press charges. McDermott rounds up the remaining guests, including Jeanne, and buys drinks on the house as a final toast to the St. Gregory.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2084009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084009", "title": "Minnie Dean", "text": "Minnie Dean\n\nWilliamina \"Minnie\" Dean (September 2, 1844 – August 12, 1895) was a New Zealander who was found guilty of infanticide and hanged. She was the only woman to receive the death penalty in New Zealand, although several others were sentenced to capital punishment, but had their sentences commuted to either life or long duration imprisonment.\n\nMinnie Dean was born in Greenock, in western Scotland. Her father, John McCulloch, was a railway engineer. Her mother, Elizabeth Swan, died of cancer in 1857. It is unknown when she arrived in New Zealand, but by the early 1860s, she was living in Invercargill with two young children. She claimed she was the widow of a Tasmanian doctor, although no evidence of a marriage has been found. She was still using her birth name, McCulloch.\n\nIn 1872, she married an innkeeper named Charles Dean. The two lived in Etal Creek, then an important stop on the route from Riverton to the Otago goldfields. When the gold rush died down, the couple turned to farming, but were soon in dire financial straits. The family moved to Winton, where Charles Dean took up pig farming. Minnie Dean, meanwhile, began to earn money by taking in unwanted children in exchange for payment. In an era when there were few methods of contraception, and when childbirth outside marriage was frowned upon, there were many women wishing to discreetly send their children away for adoption – as such, Minnie Dean was not short on customers. It is believed that she was responsible for as many as nine young children at any one time. She received payment either weekly or in a lump sum.\n\nInfant mortality was a significant problem in New Zealand at this time (as it was estimated to run to about eighty to one hundred infants out of one thousand colonial births). As such, a number of children under Dean's care died of various illnesses. In March 1889, a six-month-old child had died of convulsions, while in October 1891, a six-week-old baby had perished from cardiovascular and respiratory ailments, while a boy allegedly drowned under her care during 1894. She hid the body in her garden, arousing further suspicions. A coroner's inquest was held, and Dean was not held responsible for the deaths, due to universally poor standards of hygiene, even at childbirth itself. Nevertheless, Dean came to be distrusted by the community, and rumours of mistreatment circulated. Additionally, children under Dean's care allegedly went missing without explanation. In the public's mind, this linked Dean to cases of infanticide or baby farming in the United Kingdom and Australia, where women killed children under their care to avoid having to support them. At the time, lax childcare legislation meant that Dean did not have to keep records of the children she agreed to take in, and so proving that the children had disappeared was difficult.\n\nBefore Dean's trial and execution, four other women had been tried and sentenced to death - Caroline Whitting (found guilty in 1872), Phoebe Veitch (1883) and Sarah-Jane and Anna Flannagan (1891). In each case, these sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. In each case, child murder was the culpable offence. Thirty years later, in 1926, Daniel Cooper was also convicted of baby farming and also executed for the offence, although Martha, his second wife, was acquitted. In a broader, international context, Dean's misdeeds may also have been viewed in the same light as late Victorian contemporaries and fellow \"baby farmers\" such as Amelia Dyer in the United Kingdom (convicted in 1896) and John and Sarah Makin (1893) and Frances Lydia Alice Knorr in New South Wales (1893), as well as previous New Zealand historical instances of ostensibly deliberate child deaths. Certainly, given the proximity of New South Wales, the Makin case featured in New Zealand newspapers during the same period as the Minnie Dean controversy and trial.\n\nIn 1895, Dean was observed boarding a train carrying a young baby and a hatbox, but observed leaving the same train without the baby and only the hatbox. As railway porters later testified, the object was suspiciously heavy. A woman, Jane Hornsby, came forward claiming to have given her granddaughter, Eva, to Dean, and clothes identified as belonging to this child were found at Dean's residence, but Dean could not produce the child herself. A search along the railway line found no sign of the child. Dean was arrested and charged with murder. Her garden was dug up, and three bodies (two of babies, and one of a boy estimated to be three years old) were uncovered. An inquest found that one child (Eva) had died of suffocation and one, later identified as one-year-old Dorothy Edith Carter, had died from an overdose of laudanum (used on children to sedate them). The cause of death for the third child was not determined. Dean was charged with their murder.\nIn her trial, Dean's lawyer Alfred Hanlon argued that all deaths were accidental, and that they had been covered up to prevent adverse publicity of the sort that Dean had previously been subjected to. On 21 June 1895, however, Dean was found guilty of Dorothy Carter's murder, and sentenced to death. Between June and August 1895, Dean wrote her own account of her life. Altogether, she claimed to have cared for twenty-eight children. Of these, five were in good health when her establishment was raided, six had died whilst under her care, and one had been reclaimed by her parents. Apart from her two adopted daughters, that left fourteen or so children unaccounted for, according to her own record.\n\nOn 12 August, she was hanged by the official executioner Tom Long at the Invercargill gaol, at the intersection of Spey and Leven streets, in what is now the Noel Leeming carpark. She is the only woman to have been executed in New Zealand, and as capital punishment in New Zealand has been abolished, it is likely that she will retain that distinction. She is buried in Winton, alongside her husband, who died in a house fire in 1908. Her crimes led to the belated passage of child welfare legislation in New Zealand—the Infant Life Protection Act 1893 and the Infant Protection Act 1896.\n\nIn 1985, Dean's trial was the subject of \"In Defence of Minnie Dean\", the first episode of the Emmy-nominated \"Hanlon\" New Zealand television drama series about the career of Dean's lawyer. The episode won the Best Director, Best Drama Programme, Drama Script, and Performance, Female, in a Dramatic Role categories at the 1986 Listener Television Awards (also called the GOFTA Awards), and \"contributed to a re-evaluation of Dean's conviction\".\n\nMinnie Dean is referenced in Dudley Benson's 2006 song \"It's Akaroa's Fault\" (\"I don't want to meet Minnie Dean at the end of my life/If I were to meet her I'd keep her hatbox in sight\"). Authors Lynley Hood and John Rawle wrote posthumous accounts and reconstructions of the case as the centenary of her apprehension and execution occurred, in 1995.\n\nOn Friday 30 January 2009 the \"Otago Daily Times\" reported that a headstone had appeared mysteriously on Dean's grave. The headstone reads \"Minnie Dean is part of Winton's history Where she now lies is now no mystery\". It is unknown who placed the headstone there. Her family had been considering it but claim that this was not their doing.\n\n\"The Southland Times\" reported on 23 February 2009 that the family laid a headstone to honour Dean and her husband's grave.\n\nAt the 2012 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, a play titled \"A Cry Too Far From Heaven\" was performed by a Southland (NZ) theatre company and featured Minnie Dean as one of the title characters on her last night before execution.\n\nIn 2013, the New Zealand musician Marlon Williams wrote a song inspired by Minnie's case, entitled \"Ballad of Minnie Dean\".\n\n\n\n"}

Ulmer and starring Boris Karloff and Béla Lugosi. The picture was the first of eight films (six of which were produced by Universal) to pair the two iconic actors. It became Universal Pictures' biggest box office hit of the year, and was among the earlier movies with an almost continuous music score. Lugosi also appeared in the 1941 film with the same title.\n\nThe film helped to create and popularize the psychological horror subgenre, emphasizing on atmosphere, eerie sounds, the darker side of the human psyche, and emotions like fear and guilt to deliver its scares, something that was not used in the horror genre.\n\nNewlyweds Peter (David Manners) and Joan Alison (Julie Bishop), on their honeymoon in Hungary, learn that due to a mixup, they must share a train compartment with Dr. Vitus Werdegast (Béla Lugosi), a Hungarian psychiatrist. Eighteen years before, Werdegast went to World War I, never seeing his wife again. He has spent the last 15 years in an infamous prison camp in Siberia. On the train, the doctor explains that he is traveling to see an old friend, Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff), an Austrian architect.\n\nLater, the doctor, Peter, and Joan, share a bus, which crashes on a desolate, rain-swept road. Joan is injured, and the doctor and Peter take her to Poelzig's home, built upon the ruins of Fort Marmorus, which Poelzig commanded during the war. Werdegast treats Joan's injury, administering the tranquilizing drug hyoscine, causing her to behave erratically. While Peter puts her to bed, Werdegast accuses Poelzig of betraying the fort during the war to the Russians, resulting in the death of thousands of Austro-Hungarian soldiers. He also accuses Poelzig of stealing his wife Karen while he was in prison. Previously, Werdegast killed Poelzig's black cat, and Poelzig explains that Werdegast has a strong fear of the animals. Poelzig carries a second black cat around the house with him while he oversees his \"collection\" of dead women on display in glass cases, including Karen.\nPoelzig plans to sacrifice Joan in a satanic ritual during the dark of the moon. Poelzig had married Werdegast's wife, and when she died, he married his daughter (who was told her real father died in prison). He is seen reading a book called \"The Rites of Lucifer\" while a beautiful blonde woman (Lucille Lund) sleeps next to him. The blonde is Werdegast's daughter – thus, Poelzig's stepdaughter – also named Karen. Werdegast, who is unaware of his daughter's presence, bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike the mad architect. He also tries to persuade his foe to spare Peter and Joan, at one point literally gambling with their lives by playing a game of chess with Poelzig, which he loses.\n\nThis moment comes during the beginning of the satanists' service, when a female acolyte sees something which causes her to scream and faint. Werdegast and his servant Thamal (Harry Cording) snatch Joan from the sacrificial altar and carry her into the catacombs beneath the house, where Peter is rendered unconscious by Poelzig's servant. Joan tells Werdegast his daughter is alive in the building somewhere. He discovers that Poelzig has killed his daughter, and in an insane rage, shackles him to an embalming rack, where he proceeds to literally skin Poelzig alive. Joan tries to tear a key from the dead hand of Poelzig's servant, and Peter, regaining consciousness, mistakes Werdegast's attempt to help her as an attack and shoots him. Fatally wounded, Werdegast blows up the house, first letting the couple escape but with Poelzig's \"rotten cult\" still upstairs. \"It has been a good game,\" he says before he dies.\n\nCast notes\n\n\"The Black Cat\" was the biggest box-office hit of the year for Universal and was the first of eight movies (six of which were produced by Universal) to pair actors Béla Lugosi and Boris Karloff. Director Edgar G. Ulmer's film was part of a boom in horror sound films following the release of \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" in 1931.\n\nThe film has little to do with Edgar Allan Poe's 1843 short story \"The Black Cat\", though Poe's name is listed in the credits. The film exploited a sudden public interest in psychiatry. Peter Ruric (better known as pulp writer \"Paul Cain\") wrote the screenplay.\n\nThe classical music soundtrack, compiled by Heinz Eric Roemheld (composed of pieces from Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Chopin and others) occupies nearly 80% of the film.\n\nThe movie bears no relation to the 1941 \"The Black Cat\", starring Basil Rathbone except for the presence of Lugosi in both pictures.\n\nThe film was released in UK cinemas under the title \"House of Doom\".\n\nThe film – and by extension, the character of Hjalmar Poelzig – draws inspiration from the life of occultist Aleister Crowley. The name Poelzig was borrowed from architect Hans Poelzig, whom Ulmer claimed to have worked with on the sets for Paul Wegener's silent film \"\".\n\nUpon the film's original 1934 release, \"The New York Times\" reviewer wrote: \"\"The Black Cat\" is more foolish than horrible. The story and dialogue pile the agony on too thick to give the audience a reasonable scare.\"\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating from critics of 87%. It was also ranked #68 on Bravo's \"100 Scariest Movie Moments\" for its \"skinning\" scene. (\"Karloff gets skinned alive at the end,\" noted Cramps guitarist and horror aficionado Poison Ivy, \"but they show the shadow of it and somehow that's more gruesome.\")\n\nThe critic Philip French called it \"the first (and best) of seven Karloff/Lugosi joint appearances. The movie unfolds like a nightmare that involves necrophilia, ailurophobia, drugs, a deadly game of chess, torture, flaying, and a black mass with a human sacrifice. This bizarre, utterly irrational masterpiece, lasting little more than an hour, has images that bury themselves in the mind.\"\n\nIn the 2010s, \"Time Out\" polled authors, directors, actors and critics who had worked in the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. \"Time Out\" placed \"The Black Cat\" at number 89 on the top 100.\n\n\n"}

The film takes place in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, during the summer of 1973. Its primary focus is a young girl, Troy (played by Zelda Harris), and her family. Throughout the film, Troy learns life lessons through her four rowdy brothers, her loving but strict mother (Alfre Woodard), and her naive, struggling father (Delroy Lindo).\n\nA distinctive characteristic of \"Crooklyn\" is its soundtrack, composed completely of music from the 1970s, except the hit single \"Crooklyn\" by the Crooklyn Dodgers, a rap crew composed of Buckshot, Masta Ace, and Special Ed. A two-volume release of the soundtrack became available on CD along with the release of the film.\n\nSimilarly to \"School Daze\", \"Do the Right Thing\", and \"She's Gotta Have It\", Spike Lee appears in \"Crooklyn\". He plays a young glue huffer named Snuffy, who likes to bully the local children.\n\n\"Crooklyn\" is the second of only two films directed by Spike Lee to earn a PG-13 rating in the USA, a distinction it shares with \"Malcolm X\".\n\nNew Yorkers selected the film for simultaneous screenings across New York City as part of the 2017 One Film, One New York contest.\n\nIn 1973, nine-year-old Troy Carmichael and her brothers Clinton, Wendell, Nate, and Joseph live in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The children live with their parents, Woody, a struggling musician, and Carolyn , a schoolteacher. Some of the impacting neighbors of this film are Jesse and Jose.\n\nThe neighborhood is filled with colorful characters. The Carmichaels' next-door neighbor, Tony Eyes, continuously sings and plays his electric keyboard. Snuffy and Right Hand Man are glue sniffers. Vic Powell is a war vet who lives upstairs from the Carmichaels.\n\nOne day, the Carmichael children get into a dispute with Tony who alleges that they are always throwing trash into his area. The argument escalates when Carolyn and several neighborhood children get involved. Tony is still yelling when Vic comes downstairs. Vic then punches Tony in the face. Troy, who has sneaked out to the corner store, sees Vic getting arrested as she leaves the store.\n\nOne night, Woody and Carolyn argue about money; Carolyn resents Woody because he is not appreciating their financial situation and uses their money carelessly to fund his solo career. The argument escalates as Carolyn yells for the children to turn off the television. Carolyn later turns off the TV.\n\nClinton turns his back on Carolyn and she grabs him for disobeying. Woody then grabs her and carries her out of the room. Woody carries Carolyn out of the room and down the stairs and Nate jumps on Woody's back. The other children hold Carolyn and Carolyn hurts her ankle in the struggle.\n\nCarolyn kicks Woody out of the house. Woody brings flowers to Carolyn and the two reconcile. The family then decides to go on a trip. As they are leaving, a worker from Con Ed comes by to shut off the electricity due to an unpaid bill. The trip is postponed and the family has to use candles for light.\n\nA few days later the family travels to the South to stay with affluent relatives. Troy stays with her cousin, Viola, who was adopted by Uncle Clem and Aunt Song. Troy has fun with Viola despite a dislike of her snobby Aunt Song and her dog, Queenie. On Troy's tenth birthday, she gets a letter from Carolyn. After reading the letter and dealing with constant bickering between Viola and Aunt Song, Troy decides she wants to go home.\n\nWhen Troy returns to New York, she is picked up at the airport by Aunt Maxine and Uncle Brown. Troy later learns her mother is in the hospital and is taken to see her.\n\nLater that evening, Woody tells the kids that their mother has cancer and must stay in the hospital. The boys cry, but Troy remains stoic. Troy then begins filling in the mother role while Carolyn remains in the hospital but later dies from her battle with cancer.\n\nIn the next scene, one of Troy's brothers wonder if they have to dress up for their mother's funeral. The day of the funeral, Troy is approached by her Aunt Maxine who tries to coax her into trying on the new clothes she's brought telling her it would make Carolyn proud. Troy calmly explains that her mother hates polyester and would never let her wear it then announces to Woody that she is not going to the funeral. After Woody explains that Carolyn would want them all together at church, Troy agrees to go.\n\nAt the house gathering after the funeral, Troy is withdrawn. Joseph comes inside crying, saying that Snuffy and Right Hand Man robbed him. Following her mother's wishes to protect her younger brother, Troy goes outside with a baseball bat and hits Snuffy, telling him to go sniff glue on his own block.\n\nEarly the next morning, Troy dreams she's hearing her mother's voice. She goes downstairs to see her father trying to kill a rat in the kitchen. Woody then tells her that it is all right to cry, saying that even Clinton has cried. Troy concludes that it is good that her mother is no longer suffering.\n\nIn the epilogue, the Carmichael family and their friends carry on with their lives as the summer draws to a close. Troy assumes the matriarch role that Carolyn left behind. Carolyn's spirit continues to visit Troy, praising her for taking on such responsibilities.\n\n\nSpike Lee was signed to a multiyear deal with Universal Studios, giving them the first look at buying any of his films, and in March 1993 they approved production for \"Crooklyn\", which would be the first one made under this deal. Lee co-wrote the script with two of his siblings, basing the story of the mother's illness on their own life experience. Zelda Harris was cast for the role of Troy through an open audition process. For the music in the film, Lee picked all the songs himself, choosing ones from his childhood. The filming took place on location in New York, including Fort Greene Park.\n\nDuring the scenes of the film that take place in the South, the shots were filmed with an anamorphic lens in such a way to give a squeezed appearance, illustrating the alienated feelings Troy was having in a place very strange to her. During the original run of the film, audience members were confused by these squeezed images, assuming there was some kind of technical error, so the studio put up signs in the theaters to explain the effect was intentional.\n\n\"Crooklyn\" premiered at the San Francisco International Film Festival on May 12, 1994. It was released to theaters in May 1994, and debuted at number three at the box office.\n\nAs of October 2019, \"Crooklyn\" holds a rating of 77% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. When the film was released, Janet Maslin of the \"New York Times\" wrote, \"Messy as the semiautobiographical \"Crooklyn\" often is, it succeeds in becoming a touching and generous family portrait, a film that exposes welcome new aspects of this director's talent.\" \"Variety's\" Todd McCarthy called the film \"both annoying and vibrant, casually plotted and deeply personal,\" adding that it \"ends up being as compelling as it is messy\". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars, stating, \"Lee's wonderful opening title sequence shows the children's street games that flourished in Brooklyn in the 1970s. Today, he says, those games have died, and he had to teach them to the actors who played the children. They have died because the kids in comparable neighborhoods today are afraid to go outside and play in the streets. \"Crooklyn\" is not in any way an angry film. But thinking about the difference between its world and ours can make you angry, and I think that was one of Lee's purposes here.\"\n\nIn a 2018 \"Variety\" article looking back on Lee's filmography, Joe Leydon ranked \"Crooklyn\" at ninth place: \"At once street smart and sweetly sentimental, this warmly nostalgic coming-of-age drama could be described as a Spike Lee movie for people who normally dislike Spike Lee movies.\"\n\nNew Yorkers selected the film for free, simultaneous screenings across all five New York City boroughs as part of the 2017 One Film, One New York contest.\n\n"}

It is an obvious portmanteau of the cities' names. There is an official Euroregion called Helsinki–Tallinn Euregio.\n\n\"Talsinki\" is often used to imply that the commercial centre of Tallinn has become \"the Helsinkians' living room\". Every summer, thousands of Helsinkian tourists travel to Tallinn and back the same day, spending their entire time in Tallinn shopping in the various department stores and markets in the city centre and the Old Town, attracted by the low prices. Very few tourists venture outside the centre, and fewer still travel to other Estonian cities.\n\nThe converse happens much more rarely. Many Estonian tourists like to visit Finland every year, but the shopping phenomenon on their side is not necessarily \"cheap\" shopping but rather \"different\" shopping - it is about finding different goods. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Estonian living standard (although still not on the level of Finland) has improved drastically. In fact, many goods are more expensive in Estonia than in Finland (e.g., some food supplies, clothes, etc.)\n\nThere are also have been proposals to connect Helsinki and Tallinn as one metropolitan area, like Copenhagen and Malmö (Øresund Region), by a railroad beneath the Gulf of Finland. Peter Vesterbacka has claimed the tunnel will be ready in the 2020s\n\n\n"}

Haas was credited with saving the once struggling company.\n\nHaas was born to a Jewish family, one of four children of Abraham Haas and Fanny Koshland. His father was an immigrant from Bavaria who founded the Hellman, Haas and Company which eventually became the Smart & Final grocery store chain. His mother was the daughter of Simon Koshland, one of the most successful wool merchants in San Francisco. His siblings were Charles, Ruth (1891), and Eleanor (1900). In 1910, Haas graduated with a BS degree from the University of California, Berkeley College of Commerce, where he was a member of the Order of the Golden Bear. Haas served in the U.S. Army Field Artillery during World War I.\n\nUpon his return to the United States in 1919, he worked at the Levi Strauss & Company, then a small drygoods wholesaler and maker of work clothing, owned by the family of his wife. In 1928, he became president and served in that position until 1955; thereafter, he served as chairman until 1970 and remained active in company affairs until his death in 1979. Haas' tenure and dedication at Levi Strauss – along with that of his business partner and brother-in-law Daniel E. Koshland Sr., father of biochemist Daniel E. Koshland Jr. – is widely credited with saving the company leading it through the Great Depression, racial integration at its factories, the global popularization of the Levi brand, and the creation of the Levi Strauss Foundation.\n\nA Republican, he was an alternate delegate to the 1952 Republican National Convention. He was Jewish, and served as president of the San Francisco Jewish Welfare Federation.\n\nIn 1914, Haas married Elise Stern, daughter of Sigmund Stern, the son of David Stern and the nephew of Levi Strauss (Strauss had died unmarried and without children and deeded his company to his four nephews). Haas had three children: Rhoda Haas Goldman, Peter E. Haas, and Walter A. Haas Jr. In 1989, the University of California, Berkeley Regents voted to rename the business school the Haas School of Business in his honor, after a large gift from the Haas family.\n\n"}

The museum was founded in the Dorobanți neighbourhood in 1947, closed by the Ceauşescu regime in 1977, and re-opened in 1992. It is now a branch of The National Museum of Art of Romania. Its collection includes works by Romanian artists—including a masterful portrait of Zambaccian himself by Corneliu Baba—and works by several French impressionists. It is located not far from Piaţa Dorobanţilor on a street now renamed after Zambaccian.\n\nAt the time the museum was founded, the act of donation stated that it must be housed in Zambaccian's former home. However, after the 1977 Bucharest earthquake (which did no detectable damage to the museum building), the Romanian government created the Museum of Art Collections, consolidating many of the city's smaller museums (and a good number of expropriated private collections). The Zambaccian collection still resided at the Museum of Art Collections at the time of the Romanian Revolution of 1989; it was returned to its historic location in 1992.\n\nArtists in the collection include Romanians Ion Andreescu, Corneliu Baba, Apcar Baltazar, Henri Catargi, Alexandru Ciucurencu, Horia Damian, Nicolae Dărăscu, Lucian Grigorescu, Nicolae Grigorescu, Iosif Iser, Ştefan Luchian, Samuel Mutzner, Alexandru Padina, Theodor Pallady, Gheorghe Petrașcu, Vasile Popescu, Camil Ressu, and Nicolae Tonitza, and French artists Pierre Bonnard, Paul Cézanne—the museum has the only Cézanne in Romania—, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Eugène Delacroix, André Derain, Raoul Dufy, Albert Marquet, Henri Matisse, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Maurice Utrillo, as well as pieces by two other artists who worked in France, the Spaniard Pablo Picasso and the Englishman Alfred Sisley.\n\nThe courtyard features a large sculpture by Romanian sculptor Oscar Han; other sculptors with works in the collection are Constantin Brâncuși, Cornel Medrea, Miliţa Pătraşcu, Dimitrie Paciurea, and Frederic Storck; Storck's own former home, also in the north end of Bucharest, is also now a museum.\n\n"}

Haas Jr. (January 24, 1916 – September 20, 1995) was a president and CEO (1958–1976) and chairman (1970–1981) of Levi Strauss & Co, succeeding his father Walter A. Haas (1889–1979). He led the company in its growth from a regional manufacturer and wholesaler of work clothes to one of the world’s leading apparel companies. In 1953, together with his wife, Evelyn, he founded the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund, a private family foundation based in San Francisco, California.\n\nHaas was born to a Jewish family in San Francisco, the son of Elise (née Stern) and Walter A. Haas. His mother was the daughter of Sigmund Stern (the nephew of Levi Strauss and the son of David Stern); and Rosalie (née Meyer) Stern (the daughter of Harriet Newmark Meyer and Marc Eugene Meyer; and the granddaughter of rabbi Joseph Newmark). Haas graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1937. His father was a prominent supporter of the university; the Haas School of Business was named in his honor. Haas attended the Harvard Business School and earned an MBA in 1939.\n\nHaas was the owner of the Oakland Athletics baseball club, acquiring the team from Charles O. Finley in August 1980 for less than $13 million. The acquisition was to prevent the team from moving, as Finley had wanted to sell to industrialist Marvin Davis, who planned to move the team to Denver. Under Haas' ownership, the Athletics won five American League West Division titles (the first in 1981 and the last in 1992, advancing to three consecutive World Series between 1988 and 1990, defeating the cross-bay rival San Francisco Giants in 1989 in a sweep marred only by the infamous Loma Prieta earthquake).\n\nHaas sought to strengthen Levi Strauss & Co.’s position as a socially responsible international corporation. During the 1950s, Haas, along with his brother, Peter E. Haas, oversaw racial integration of the company’s plants. He also led the creation of Community Involvement Teams for Levi Strauss & Co. employees. Haas served on the boards of the Ford Foundation and the National Park Foundation while leading Levi Strauss & Co. He was also involved in other nonprofit institutions such as the Hunter’s Point Boys’ Club and the San Francisco Chronicle’s Season of Sharing Fund.\n\nTogether with his wife, Haas established the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund in 1953 as a private family foundation. As its mission statement describes, the Fund “seeks to fulfill (its) founders’ vision of a just and caring society that provides fundamental rights and opportunities so that all people can live, work and raise their families with dignity.” Of his family’s philanthropy, Haas used to say, \"It's in the genes.\"\n\nIn 1940, Haas married Evelyn Danzig Haas; they had three children: Robert D. Haas, former chairman and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. who is married to Colleen Gershon Haas; philanthropist Betsy Haas Eisenhardt who is married to Roy Eisenhardt; and Walter J. Haas, co-chairman of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund and former chairman and CEO of the Oakland Athletics, who is married to Julie Salles Haas. Haas died at age 79 from prostate cancer at his San Francisco residence. Funeral services were held at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco.\n\n"}

Dworkin was also featured as a major character in a prequel series of four books written by John Gregory Betancourt.\n\nDworkin was born into House Barimen, a noble family in the Courts of Chaos. His usual appearance was that of a dwarf, although like many Lords of Chaos, he was able to change his shape.\n\nAfter obtaining the Left Eye of the Serpent of Chaos (which would later be known as the Jewel of Judgment) through methods unknown, he fled into Shadow and met the Unicorn of Order. With her help and using the Eye, he inscribed the Primal Pattern, giving form to Amber.\n\nEarly in Amber's history, Dworkin served in the court of his son, King Oberon, as an advisor and teacher of magical skills, including the power of creating Trumps. He was frequently absent from Amber, in places unknown. His students included many or most of Oberon's children, including Bleys, Brand, and Fiona, who received advanced instruction.\n\nPrior to the beginning of \"The Chronicles of Amber\", Dworkin went mad, apparently because of damage to the Primal Pattern, which was linked to and reflected in his own mind.\n\nPrince Corwin, Oberon's son and the protagonist of the first five books of \"The Chronicles of Amber\", learns that Dworkin had been imprisoned by Oberon for several centuries. Oberon had deemed Dworkin to be dangerous and unstable, after Dworkin privately proposed that the Pattern should be destroyed. This would clear the way to create a new and undamaged Pattern, but would also result in the destruction of Amber and all of the alternate realities it cast as Shadows.\n\nDworkin proves to be capable of leaving his prison at will, during lucid periods of temporary improvement in his madness. He voluntarily returns and confines himself when he feels madness coming upon him again.\n\nAfter Corwin is imprisoned for five years in the dungeons below Amber's castle, Dworkin helps Corwin escape by drawing a Trump depicting the Lighthouse of Cabra on the wall of Corwin's cell.\n\nOberon, the first king of Amber, was Dworkin's son. By some accounts, the Unicorn gave birth to Oberon.\n\nIn \"The Chronicles of Amber\", no other children of Dworkin were mentioned. However, in the \"Dawn of Amber\" prequel series (a set of four authorized Amber novels written by John Gregory Betancourt), many more children of Dworkin were introduced:\n\nComputer programmer Felix Croes uses \"Dworkin\" as a pseudonym, referring to Dworkin Barimen, and named his MUD software platform Dworkin's Game Driver.\n"}
{"id": "2084075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084075", "title": "Iliupersis", "text": "Iliupersis\n\nThe Iliupersis (Greek: , \"Iliou persis\", \"Sack of Ilium\"), also known as The Sack of Troy, is a lost epic of ancient Greek literature. It was one of the Epic Cycle, that is, the Trojan cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The story of the \"Iliou persis\" comes chronologically after that of the \"Little Iliad\", and is followed by the \"Nostoi\" (\"Returns\"). The \"Iliou persis\" was sometimes attributed by ancient writers to Arctinus of Miletus (8th century BCE) (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised two books of verse in dactylic hexameter.\n\nThe \"Iliou persis\" was probably composed in the seventh century BCE, but there is much uncertainty. Ancient sources date Arctinus to the eighth century BCE, but evidence concerning another of his poems, the \"Aethiopis\", suggests that he lived considerably later than that.\n\nOnly ten lines of the original text of the \"Iliou persis\" survive. For its storyline we are almost entirely dependent on a summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the \"Chrestomathy\" written by an unknown Proclus (possibly to be identified with the 2nd century CE grammarian Eutychius Proclus). A few other references give indications of the poem's storyline. A further impression of the poem's content may be gained from book 2 of Virgil's \"Aeneid\" (written many centuries after the \"Iliou persis\"), which tells the story from a Trojan point of view.\n\nNote that different sources record some details differently: for example the manner of Aeneas' departure from Troy, or the identity of Astyanax's killer. The version told here specifically follows what is known of the early epic poem, rather than any other source.\n\nThe poem opens with the Trojans discussing what to do with the wooden horse which the Greeks have left behind. Cassandra and Laocoön proclaim that there is an armed force of Greeks inside, but others say it is a holy relic of Athena. The latter opinion prevails, and the Trojans celebrate their apparent victory. The god Poseidon, meanwhile, sends an ill omen of two snakes which kill Laocoön and his sons; seeing this, Aeneas and his men leave Troy in anticipation of what is to come.\n\nWhen night comes, the Greek warriors inside the horse emerge, and open the city gates to let in the Greek army, which has sailed back from Tenedos. The Trojans are massacred, and the Greeks set fire to the city.\n\nNeoptolemus kills king Priam, even though he has taken refuge at the altar of Zeus; Menelaus kills Deiphobus and takes back his wife Helen; Ajax the Lesser rapes Cassandra and drags her from the altar of Athena. The gods consider whether they should stone Ajax in retribution, but he in turn also takes refuge at the altar of Athena. Later, when the Greeks are sailing home, Athena kills him at sea. Odysseus kills Hector's baby son Astyanax and Neoptolemus takes Hector's wife Andromache captive. The Greeks make a human sacrifice of Priam's daughter Polyxena at Achilles's tomb, to placate his angry spirit.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2084088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084088", "title": "Cloakroom", "text": "Cloakroom\n\nA cloakroom, or sometimes coatroom, is a room for people to hang their coats, cloaks or other outerwear when they enter a building. Cloakrooms are typically found inside large buildings, such as gymnasiums, schools, churches or meeting halls. In smaller buildings, people may hang their own coats, but in large buildings or complexes, coatcheck attendants may take the coats. In some venues, such as nightclubs, using the cloakroom's coat check service is mandatory.\n\nThe name comes from the French word \"cloque\", meaning \"traveling cloak\". In the UK, a cloakroom may also refer to a lavatory.\n\nAttended cloakrooms, or coat checks, are staffed rooms where coats and bags can be stored securely. Typically, a ticket or receipt is given to the customer, with a corresponding ticket attached to the garment or item. Coat checks are often found at the entrances to nightclubs, theaters, concert halls, larger restaurants, or museums. A fee may be charged, or a tip may be paid by the customer when they reclaim their item. Some coat checks post signs proclaiming any fees or tips, especially when their use is mandatory (as in many museums).\n\nThe United States Congress \"cloakrooms\" are locations where members of Congress may interact outside the formal meeting rooms, and are used by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The cloakrooms serve as a place for members to socialize, eat, and take naps without leaving the building. These rooms are closed to all except for Senators, Representatives, Senate Pages, and a few of their trusted staffers, and may even have their own private phone numbers.\n\nIn India, cloak rooms are available in all major railway stations, where railway passengers can keep their luggage for a specific amount of time. Some of the bigger stations have 24-hour manned facilities, while the smaller ones operate only early morning to evening. This often suits day traders or pilgrims coming from smaller towns to larger cities and people waiting for a changeover to another train. Cloak rooms enable passengers to avoid carrying their luggage through the city while they conduct their business or tourism. The facilities are operated by the Commercial Department of Indian Railways at all major railway stations; smaller railway stations may not have this facility. A clerk collects the luggage from the passengers alighting from a train at that station or passengers having a train from that station, after verifying their tickets. The locked luggage bags are collected and a receipt is issued, mentioning the date and time the luggage was surrendered. The items are then stored on racks in the cloak room. Passengers are advised not to store valuable items or personal effects in the bags. On return, passengers show their receipt, pay the necessary charges to the clerk, and collect their items.\n\nApart from the availability of cloakrooms in major railway stations, cloakrooms are present in airports in major cities in the form of a left luggage facility. The left luggage facility is present in one of the terminals of the airport (usually the terminal used for international travel). The prices of storing luggage varies according to size of the luggage and the number of hours. Prices are more expensive as compared to those at railway stations. One would require a copy of their boarding pass and a valid ID proof to store their luggage.\n\n"}
{"id": "2084095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084095", "title": "Capitol Hill (Denver)", "text": "Capitol Hill (Denver)\n\nLocated in the City and County of Denver, Colorado, the Capitol Hill neighborhood is bounded by Broadway, Downing Street, Colfax Avenue, and Seventh Avenue, which carry large volumes of traffic around the neighborhood. It is technically located in East Denver which begins immediately east of Broadway, the neighborhood's western boundary. Many consider the Cheesman Park neighborhood to be a part of the Capitol Hill neighborhood, but as defined by the city , Cheesman Park is a separate neighborhood. Denver also recognizes a statistical neighborhood called North Capitol Hill, also known as Uptown by some residents. Colfax Avenue is the border between these two neighborhoods.\n\nThe neighborhood was originally the home of Denver's elite who constructed elaborate mansions. As the economy of Denver slumped after the Silver Crash of 1893, construction in Capitol Hill concentrated on apartments. Three buildings still in existence are examples of the architecture of this time: The Colonnade, Alta Court (currently an office building), and the Hamilton. This cultural and demographic shift, from single-family mansions toward boarding houses and rental property for the transient middle class, marked a shift toward the present multi-family dominance of the neighborhood.\n\nCapitol Hill remained a solid middle-class neighborhood until after World War II, when middle-class families left Capitol Hill. The demographics of people left behind were transients and renters. \n\nAnother watershed in the history of Capitol hill was the completion of Interstate 70. No longer did incoming tourists drive down East Colfax Avenue on their way into downtown. The tourist dollar was effectively wiped out as a revenue source for East Colfax after this decade. So began another downward spiral. With no tourists to spend money along East Colfax the businesses suffered, as did the demand to go to Capitol Hill.\n\nThe affordability, urban character and eclectic architecture made the area appealing to young bohemians, artists, musicians (Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg were former neighborhood residents) which has led to a gradual gentrification that reached its height during the 2000s. The rents in the neighborhood have increased significantly over the past decade, and many of the cheap apartments in the area have been converted into more expensive condominiums. Nonetheless the neighborhood has an older housing stock which lacks off-street parking, contributing to a relative affordability compared to other central neighborhoods.\n\nCurrently many portions of East Colfax Avenue are undergoing redevelopment to make them denser and more pedestrian-friendly. Despite these redevelopment efforts, a brief stroll along Colfax Avenue through the Capitol Hill neighborhood will provide a glimpse of its history.\n\nIn 2012 the state history museum of Colorado, the History Colorado Center, was opened next to the new Colorado State Judiciary building.\n\nThe neighborhood is located just southeast of Denver's Central Business District (CBD) in a well-established residential neighborhood, with commercial centers located along major traffic routes (such as Colfax Avenue and Broadway) and interior arterials (such as East 13th and 14th Avenues). The neighborhood is directly east of the Civic Center neighborhood and the Colorado State Capitol. Over 95% of this neighborhood is developed. The average year of construction for buildings is 1920, with some of the oldest single-family homes in the city. The characteristics of Capitol Hill are closely related to other east Denver neighborhoods, which include the hospital district and the North Capitol Hill neighborhood. Public transportation and city support services are readily available.\nNeighborhood Boundaries:\n\nCapitol Hill is Denver's most densely populated neighborhood. It was once the home of Denver's elite and origination of Foursquare architecture in Denver. Today it consists of historic mansions, apartments and condo buildings. Because of the concentration of multi-family uses and the urban character of the neighborhood, parking is at a premium. The area is strongly influenced by the Colorado State Capitol, which is within its boundaries, and Downtown Denver which is adjacent to the northwest boundary of the neighborhood. Commercial uses are typically located on major arterials such as Colfax Avenue, East 8th Avenue, East 14th Avenue, East 13th Avenue, Lincoln Street and Broadway. A considerable number of mansion properties have been converted to office uses over the past several years due to zoning exemptions offered to historic structures which are zoned for residential uses. Office development in the neighborhood is primarily concentrated in the northwest portion of the neighborhood with small professional offices located throughout the neighborhood.\n\nThe Capitol Hill neighborhood is influenced by its proximity to the Colorado State Capitol, Downtown and its northern boundary, East Colfax Avenue.\n\nCapitol Hill is one of the most cosmopolitan neighborhoods in Denver, well known as a haven for artists and bohemians. There are numerous restaurants, clubs, bars, stores, concert venues, and other cultural amenities in the community. East 13th Avenue is the center of Denver's punk community with various stores that cater to punks and hipsters. Colfax Avenue has a reputation for a wild nightlife with multiple concert venues (The Fillmore Auditorium, The Ogden Theater, The Bluebird Theater, 1Up Colfax), and numerous late-night bars, coffeeshops, restaurants, and stores on the street. During the day, lobbyists and politicians from the Colorado State Capitol can be seen making deals in the restaurants and bars of the neighborhood. The neighborhood also has a reputation for being a very gay and lesbian friendly area of Denver. \n\nCapitol Hill is next to two major Denver parks, Civic Center Park and Cheesman Park. Both of these are meeting centers for the community; they host many festivals, including the Capitol Hill United Neighborhoods-sponsored People's Fair in early June.\n\nCapitol Hill has had a long bohemian reputation with the Colburn Hotel on Grant Street being a onetime residence of Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg.\n\n\nCapitol Hill is well known for its crime, particularly the sale and common use of drugs in the neighborhood. Recently drug sales have decreased in the neighborhood as policing initiatives brought down the crime rate and hastened the ongoing gentrification. The crime rate in 2014 in the Capitol Hill neighborhood was 8.63 incidents per 1,000 residents, one of the worst violent crime rates in Denver.\n"}

At the age of thirteen, he travelled to America with his father who was a diplomat (Consul General of France). He attended the Jesuit school in New Orleans and became a paper boy for the \"New Orleans Item\". He developed interests in travelling, writing and cars.\n\nLapierre renovated a 1927 Nash that his mother gave him and decided to travel across America during his summer holidays. To earn his way he painted mail boxes. Later, he received a scholarship to study the Aztec civilization in Mexico. He hitch-hiked throughout America living an adventurous existence, wrote articles, washed windows in churches, gave lectures, and even found a job as a siren cleaner on a boat returning to Europe. One day a truck driver who picked him up on the road to Chicago stole his suitcase. He found the driver before the police did. The \"Chicago Tribune\" paid him $100 for his exclusive story. His twenty thousand miles of adventure beginning with just thirty dollars in his pocket led to his first book \"A Dollar for a Thousand Kilometers\". It became one of the best sellers of postwar France and other European countries.\n\nWhen Lapierre was eighteen, he received a Fulbright Scholarship to study economics at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. He bought a 1937 Chrysler convertible for $30 and fell in love with a fashion editor. They were married in New York City Hall on his 21st birthday and drove to Mexico in the old Chrysler for their honeymoon. With only $300 in their pockets, they had just enough to buy gas, sandwiches, and cheap rooms in truckers’ motels. In Los Angeles, they won another $300 in a radio game show for Campbell Soup. The prize included a case of soup, which was their only food for three weeks. Lapierre sold the Chrysler for $400 in San Francisco and bought two tickets on the SS Presidential Cleveland for Japan. The honeymoon lasted for a year. They worked their way across Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and Lebanon. When they returned to France, Lapierre wrote his second book, \"Honeymoon around the Earth\".\n\nOn his return to Paris after his honeymoon, he was conscripted into the French army. After one year in the tank regiment, he was transferred to the SHAPE headquarters to serve as an interpreter. One day in the cafeteria he met a young American corporal, Larry Collins, a Yale graduate and draftee. They became friends instantly. When Collins was discharged he was offered a job with Procter & Gamble. Two days before reporting to the new job, the United Press offered him a job as caption writer at their Paris office, for much less money than offered by Procter & Gamble. Collins took the offer from United Press and was soon picked up by \"Newsweek\" to be their correspondent in the Middle East. When Lapierre was discharged, he found work as a reporter for the magazine \"Paris Match\". Collins became the godfather of the Lapierres' first child, Alexandra. On several occasions, Collins and Lapierre met while on assignment. In spite of their friendship they had to compete with each other for stories. But they decided to join forces to tell a big story which would appeal to both French and anglophone audiences. Their first bestseller \"Is Paris Burning?\" sold close to ten million copies in thirty languages. In this book they mixed the modern technique of investigation journalism with the classical methods of historical research.\n\nAfter that they spent four years in Jerusalem to reconstruct the birth of the State of Israel for the book \"O Jerusalem!\". Lapierre is proud that after spending a great deal of time in Jerusalem he knows each alley, square, street, and building in the Holy City intimately.\n\nTwo of Lapierre's books – \"Is Paris Burning?\" (co-written with Larry Collins) and \"City of Joy\" – have been made into films. Lapierre and Collins wrote several other books together, the last being \"Is New York Burning?\" (2005), before Collins' death in 2005.\n\nLapierre speaks fluent Bengali.\n\nThe \"City of Joy\" is about the unsung heroes of the Pilkhana slum in Kolkata. Lapierre donated half the royalties he earned from this book to support several humanitarian projects in Kolkata, including refuge centres for leper and polio children, dispensaries, schools, rehabilitation workshops, education programs, sanitary actions, and hospital boats. To process and channel the charitable funds he founded an association called Action aid for Calcutta lepers' children (registered in France under the official name of \"Action pour les enfants des lépreux de Calcutta\"). Aware of the corruption in India, he organizes all his fund transfers to India in such a way as to ensure that the money reaches the right person for the right purpose. His wife since 1980, Dominique Conchon-Lapierre is his partner in the City of Joy Foundation.\n\nThe royalties from \"Five Past Midnight in Bhopal\" go to the Sambhavna clinic in Bhopal which provides free medical treatment to the victims of the 1984 Union Carbide Bhopal disaster. Lapierre also funds a primary school in Oriya Basti, one of the settlements described in \"Five Past Midnight in Bhopal\".\n\nAt the age of six, he developed a passion for automobiles. Each summer, while at his grandparents' Atlantic coast beach house, he marvelled at the wonders of his uncle's American cars. When he was a Fulbright exchange student at Lafayette College, he bought, for thirty dollars, a convertible Chrysler Royal he found in a junkyard. Forty-five years later, he saw a photograph of the same Chrysler in a French vintage car magazine. The automobile was about to be auctioned in Poitiers. He rushed to the auction, made a bid, and won it. When he was a student at the University of Paris, he acquired an old Amil car, which he and a classmate drove all the way to Ankara, Turkey. He has told stories about how he drove the car in reverse to have enough torque to get through the mountain passes.

Economically, it reinvented itself from a manufacturing base into a financial centre.\n\nPolitical talks about the Second Convention of Peking resurfaced in the early 70s. The New Territories land lease agreement would end within 27 years in 1997. MacLehose began visiting Beijing to talk about the future of Hong Kong with PRC leaders.\n\nThe British and the PRC governments began a long negotiation process that would ultimately lead to the Handover of Hong Kong in 1997.\n\nUnder Sir Murray MacLehose, 25th Governor of Hong Kong (1971–82), a series of reforms improved public services, the environment, housing, welfare, education and infrastructure. MacLehose was the longest-serving governor and, by the end of his tenure, had become one of the most popular and well-known figures in the Crown Colony. MacLehose laid the foundation for Hong Kong to establish itself as a global city in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nA number of MacLehose's most significant policies included:\n\nWith the rising public service provision came a clampdown on the free flow of refugees from mainland China that had powered the growth of Hong Kong since the Second World War. In 1974, the 'touch base' was introduced, under which only those immigrant arrivals who reached the urban areas were allowed to stay. Six years later, it was replaced by a policy of repatriation for all illegal arrivals.\n\nThe Metric System was adopted under the 1976 Metrication Ordinance. Subsequently, many of the wet markets and traditional Chinese medicine shops used the old Chinese system for at least another decade.\n\nThe Hong Kong government introduced six years of free compulsory education in 1971, and expanded it to nine years in 1978. Companies were also seeking well educated employees for complex projects. Seventy-two percent of overseas graduates between 1962 and 1976 would come back to Hong Kong to take on highly skilled domestic positions.\n\nOn 7 September 1975, Commercial Television was established. It provided competition for the other two other companies: Rediffusion Television and Television Broadcasts Limited. Unable to compete, Commercial TV closed down on 22 August 1978 after only three years of operation.\n\nThe 1970s was when Hong Kong gained daily news broadcasts. News programmes ranked in the top 10 continuously for a decade. Other segments of the ratings included TV dramas, which averaged 80 to 120 episodes, usually broadcasting at 7:00 pm. 66% of the population tuned in regularly covering 2 to 3 million viewers nightly. Popular series finales would empty streets and restaurants. Most series did not contain much if any Chinese traditionalism. The theme songs of these dramas also helped revive Cantonese music - indeed the term Cantopop was coined during this period.\n\nHong Kong also found itself at a unique geographical and cultural crossroads. Many of the western artists like Elvis Presley and The Beatles were getting exposure in the music industry. Toys from Japan have arrived in Hong Kong via random and inconsistent shipments in the past. But the first big waves of Japanese products with staying power in the market place were mainly super robot toys. Gordian Warrior and Baxinger were some that were commonly available.\n\nThe 1975 Japanese series \"Ultraman\" was aired, and was named as such since the protagonist had eyes resembling eggs. The children were fascinated. Kids tried to \"fly\" in the air, imitating their heroes. Two kids (aged 3½ and 4½) attempted a flight jumping off a 7-storey building in Kowloon City on 26 July 1975. The younger brother was killed on the spot, while the elder was miraculously saved. The broadcast of the series was suspended for a while after the accident.\n\nThe martial arts films starred by Bruce Lee, including the 1971 \"The Big Boss\" () and \"Fist of Fury\" () the following year, were sensational. Cornered for some times by Western and Mandarin films, Cantonese films were much revived in the 1970s, with the great success of 1976 \"The Private Eyes\" (), directed by Michael Hui, which is said to remain the all-time box-office king of Hong Kong cinema when inflation is taken into account.\n\nThe James Bond film \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" in 1973 was filmed in Hong Kong including on the wreck of SS \"Seawise University\" the famous former Cunard Ocean liner RMS \"Queen Elizabeth\" which was destroyed by fire in 1972 and the wreck has been removed in 1975 before the film premiered.\n\nIn August 1971, Typhoon Rose passed over Hong Kong causing extensive damage, forcing the hoisting of Hurricane Signal No. 10 on 16 August. A total of 5,664 people from 1,032 families became homeless. The typhoon also destroyed 653 wooden huts and damaged 24 buildings, six beyond repair.\n\nIn June 1972, torrential rains caused two serious landslides in Sau Mau Ping and the Mid-levels respectively. Around 150 were killed and many buildings were destroyed.\n\nIn August 1979, Typhoon Hope reached Hong Kong but has weakened considerably from the 150 mph wind earlier.\n\nIn the 1970s, corruption was a way of life in Hong Kong, being the norm in all government departments. Policemen would often extract bribes (popularly called \"tea fee\") before they investigated a crime, as did firemen before they rescued people and put out fires. Many Chinese detective superintendents amassed incredible wealth from their corrupt dealings with triads and corporations. Their names have been seared into the memories of the older generations, their stories adapted into several popular movies such as \"To be Number One\" (跛豪) in 1991. That is not to say British officers were entirely clean in their dealings.\n\nIn 1974, Hong Kong Governor Murray MacLehose, realising the seriousness of the problem, founded the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). The investigations and arrests of many police officers created a furore among the police, who protested against the ICAC and even tried to overrun the headquarters in one protest.\n\nThe Governor, concerned to avoid a possible police strike or even rebellion, at last issued a pardon, preventing arrests in cases committed before 1977. However, the pardon did not extend to higher-level detective superintendents. These high-level Chinese officers, famous for their riches, left for exile to Taiwan, which had no extradition treaty with Hong Kong. In time, the efforts of the ICAC changed the habits of an entire population and turned Hong Kong into one of the least corrupt cities in the world.\n\nIn 1970, the American government returned to Japan the sovereignty of Ryukyu Islands and Diaoyutai Islands (known as the Senkaku Islands to Japan). The act stirred up campaigns for defending the Diaoyutai Islands among Chinese societies all around the world. The \"Hong Kong Federation of Students\" (香港專上學生聯會) requested a protest at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay on 7 July 1971. Having been frightened by the 1967 riots, the police tried to prevent the protest. Unnecessary violence erupted, leading to the arrests of students. The media criticised the violation of democracy. The British police officers involved were sent back to the UK and went unpunished. Protests concerning the defence of Diaoyutai Islands continued to be held the following months.\n\nMany factors contributed to the decline of manufacturing in Hong Kong. The late 1970s saw increases in land prices. Along with the opening up of global trade with China via the 1978 economic reforms, factories were gradually relocated to the mainland, where labour costs were lower.\n\nAt the same time, Singapore and Taiwan underwent similar developments to those of Hong Kong. The competitiveness of manufacturing similar products led to protectionism to shelter local companies. As a result, there was less demand for Hong Kong goods.\n\nFollowing decades of immense and sustained immigration, the shortage of housing in the territory became acute. Many lived in squatter settlements or boats, where they were susceptible to typhoons, fires and landslides. To improve the quality of public housing and relieve overcrowded conditions, the government announced the Ten-year Housing Programme (十年建屋計劃) in 1972, with the goal of providing quality housing for 1.8 million people in 10 years. The Hong Kong Housing Authority was formed to spearhead the programme. The government also introduced the Home Ownership Scheme (居者有其屋計劃) in 1976, building houses and selling them at below-market prices to help people own property.\n\nWellcome, the first supermarket in Hong Kong, was opened in Central in 1970. It was called \"Gweilo market\" by some locals, as most customers were westerners during the initial period of its operation, but Chinese citizens would soon embrace this new kind of store. By 1975, more than 200 big- and small-scaled supermarkets could be found in the city. These new stores eliminated most traditional rice dealers (米舖), wine shops (辦館) and convenient stores (See Dor) (士多). Wellcome and PARKnSHOP did not take long to capture the market. The front and full page ads of these two mega franchises aided in their increase in popularity where smaller traditional stores couldn't. The first McDonald's restaurant opened on Paterson Street, Causeway Bay in 1975.\n\nHong Kong's first modern rapid transit, the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) was opened in October 1979. The first line served eastern Kowloon from Shek Kip Mei to Kwun Tong. In December, services were extended to Tsim Sha Tsui, and by 1980, it was possible to ride from Kwun Tong to the central business district in Central on the other side of the harbour on Hong Kong Island.\n\nThe Cross-Harbour Tunnel, the first underwater tunnel in Hong Kong, opened in 1972. For the first time in the region's history, people could travel between Hong Kong and Kowloon without taking ferries. As a result, small electrical boats like sampans (小電船) were gradually eliminated.\n\nKai Tak Airport was expanded in the first half of the 1970s to handle Boeing 747s, despite of the limited land space and proximity to nearby hills.\n\nPeople grew richer entering the 1970s. Not surprisingly, people started to look for some means of investment. The passing of Banking Ordinance of 1964 would begin the tightening up of banks. A minimum capital of HK$5 million and liquidity ratio of 25% and limitation on loans and investments became the new requirements to operate legally. People began to have more trust in their banks, and the accumulation of savings led to people's willingness to invest.\n\nSoon, the stock rush began. New stocks were on sale every day; brokerage houses mushroomed; some people quit their jobs to become full-time investors, suffering a kind of urban disease that doctors called \"stock illness\". It is said that the investors during this period numbered to 500,000. The Hang Seng Index kept soaring, but then crashed in March 1973, leaving many people bankrupt. The Hong Kong economy recovered only slowly over the next few years.\n\nIn 1976, a \"Deposit-taking Companies Ordinance\" was also passed to enforce non-licensed bank institutions to register with the government. A minimum paid up capital requirement of HK$2.5 million was also required. The strategy was to mirror the Deposit Trust concept in the United States.\n\nAs a result of the water shut-down by mainland China during the Cultural Revolution riots in Hong Kong, the government responded with a desalination plant at Lok On Pai, Castle Peak in 1975. The High Island Reservoir construction went from 1969 to 1979, and was expected to be the same size as Plover Cove. The construction, contracted by a Japanese company cost more than HK$400 million.\n\nTsang Tsou Choi, or the \"Kowloon Emperor\", began his career of calligraphy graffiti in 1970.\n"}

Much like her debut album, \"Exile in Guyville\", \"Somebody's Miracle\" was originally modeled after another canonical album, \"Songs in the Key of Life\" by Stevie Wonder, though only elements of this exist in the final product. The first single, \"Everything To Me\" was released to radio on August 1, 2005. \"Somebody's Miracle\" debuted at #46 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and has sold over 83,000 copies in the U.S.\n\nThe album features a somewhat softer side of Phair, with themes of innocence, loss, and love. Many critics and fans accused Phair of having lost her edge. Phair responded to backlash by saying, \"If you are an old fan and it doesn't fit what you need, don't buy the disc.\" Prior to the album's release, Phair embarked on a short acoustic tour where she played in smaller venues, bars, and clubs. After the album's release, she and her band went on a more extensive tour playing at larger venues. Phair also performed the album's title track on the \"Charmed\" episode \"Battle of the Hexes.\" She was also the last artist to perform on the show.\n\nThe album so far has been given a score of 54 out of 100 by Metacritic based on \"mixed or average reviews\". One critic wrote, \"\"Miracle\" contains the singer's most winning melodies to date, not to mention her most confident vocals.\" MSNBC wrote that in comparison to her 2003 self-titled album, \"Somebody's Miracle\" was \"less blatantly commercial, but still smooth, reflecting her increasing shift toward a clearer sound\". Rolling Stone, however, gave the album just two stars, calling her vocals \"thin and dry\" and the album as a whole \"plain and forgettable\".\n\nThis was Liz Phair's last album for Capitol Records. Her next album, \"Funstyle\", was released on the independent label Rocket Science Records.\n\n\n"}

He served as Patriarch of Venice from 1958 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1958. He was considered to be overly dependent upon his advisers.\n\nGiovanni Urbani was born in Venice to Angelo and Elisabetta (née Borghi) Urbani, and was an artilleryman during World War I. After studying at the Patriarchal Seminary of Venice, he was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Pietro La Fontaine on September 24, 1922. Urbani then did pastoral work in Venice until 1925, furthered his studies for a year, and taught at the seminary from 1927 to 1945. He was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on November 12, 1936, and later Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on June 5, 1943.\n\nOn October 26, 1946, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Axomis. Urbani received his episcopal consecration on the following December 8 from Cardinal Adeodato Giovanni Piazza, OCD, with Bishops Giovanni Jeremich and Carlo Zinato serving as co-consecrators, in St. Mark's Basilica. Until 1955, he served as secretary and national counselor of Azione Cattolica's Central Commission, which included instructing Italian parishes against Communism. Urbani was promoted to Titular Archbishop of Sardes on November 27, 1948, and was later made Bishop of Verona, with the personal title of \"Archbishop\", on April 14, 1955.\n\nPope John XXIII named Urbani to succeed him as Patriarch of Venice on November 11, 1958. He was the first native Venetian to become Patriarch since Cardinal Ludovico Flangini Giovanelli (1801–1804), and was created Cardinal-Priest of \"S. Prisca\" by Pope John in the consistory of December 15 of that same year. His cardinalatial title was later changed to Cardinal Priest of \"S. Marco\" on March 19, 1962. From 1962 to 1965, the Cardinal attended the Second Vatican Council. He was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Pope Paul VI. Because of his moderate views, Urbani was widely seen as \"papabile\" at the conclave. In 1964, he prohibited Venetian priests and nuns from attending the Venice Biennale due to the nudism in its exhibitions.\n\nUrbani died from a heart attack in Venice, at age 69.

She was the wife of Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X and the mother of Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. She occupies as significant place as any in the annals of Mysore history. Her contributions to the citizenry, her roles of Maharani as regent and as queen mother of young prince Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, one of the most illustrious rulers of India, has remained commendable. She is considered as one of the three rare gems in the history of Mysore queens. \n\nShe was married to Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X on 26 May 1878. In 1881, the famous Rendition of Mysore was carried out and the British handed over the rule back to the natural prince Chamarajendra Wadiyar X, who was now 18, after 50 years. In 1884, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV was born to the royal couple. In quick succession, they also had another son, Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar, and three daughters.\n\nMaharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar, on a visit to Calcutta in 1894, developed diphtheria and succumbed to sudden death there, thus abruptly cutting short, a promising reign that lasted only 13 years. He was just 32 and had already left his mark as an excellent leader. His death suddenly created a void as prince Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV was still in minority. The unexpected tragedy was regarded as a great national misfortune throughout India and was deplored by the British Government as an Imperial loss. The royal family plunged into great sorrow and the citizens felt orphaned. Such was his stature. The burden fell on Maharani Kempananjammanni. History posed a new challenge to her: a severe bubonic plague struck Mysore city, reducing the population to half. Under such circumstances, she was nominated as queen-regent, a post she held for about eight tough years, from 1895 to 1902, and served the people with great aplomb, dignity, devotion, discipline and distinction. She earned the respect of one and all for the fabulous way she held fort.\n\nShe had the services of Dewan Sir K. Seshadri Iyer at that time and Sir T. R. A. Thumboo Chetty the Former Chief Judge, Senior Member of the Regency Council, who officiated many times as the Dewan, and later her brother Sir M. Kantaraj Urs (later Dewan) as her Private Secretary. She helped Mysore recover from slump. Progress in all fields resulted from their efficient administration and blessed the entire citizenry. Generation of electricity from river Cauvery, promoting Indian Institute of Science, construction of Mari Kanave Valley Anicut (Vani Vilas Sagara), construction of the new palace, extension of new localities in Mysore, water supply through pipes, and laying of foundation stone of Victoria Hospital in Bangalore were enough testimony.\n\nMaharani Kempananjamanni was a great believer in women's education and under her patronage Maharani's College got all due attention. She was a staunch follower of Hinduism, but respected all faiths equally.\n\nWhen Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV came of age, it was time for her to retire. On 8 August 1902, he ascended the throne that marked the end of memorable regency and the beginning of what was to become Mysore's Golden Era, an era that came to be known by the encomium 'Ramarajya'. The British Government awarded her with a CI. \n\nAfter a brief illness, she died on the midnight of 7 July 1934, in Bangalore.\n\nThere are many edifices in old Mysore area with prefix 'Vani Vilasa', like a Mohalla (extension), Water Works, Maternity Hospital, Girls High School, Bridge, Ladies Club, and a Road, which, to this day, commemorate her memory.\n"}

Erp was the son of Jonakr from an earlier marriage. Svanhild, the daughter of Sigurd and Gudrun, was also raised by Jonakr. \n\nKing Jörmunrek (Ermanaric) proposed to Svanhild through his son Randver, but the treacherous Bicke said that Randver tried to win Svanhild's love. Consequently, Jörmunrek sentenced Randver to death by hanging and had Svanhild trampled to death by horses. Gudrun then agitated her sons Hamdir and Sörli to avenge their half-sister. When Sörli and Hamdir met Erp en route, they did not understand his riddles and, thinking him arrogant, killed him.\n\nDuring the night, they arrived and they cut off Jörmunrek's hands and feet. This made Jörmunrek wake up and he cried for his housecarls. Hamdir said that if Erp had been alive he would have cut off the head. The housecarls could not kill the two brothers with sharp weapons, but an old one-eyed man (Odin) advised them to kill them with stones.\n\nThis is why scaldic poetry used the \"sorrow of Jonakr's sons\" as a kenning for stones.\n\nIn \"Ynglingatal\" (9th century), Þjóðólfr of Hvinir mentions their death in a comparison with the death of the Swedish king Anund:\n\nThe legend of Jörmunrek appears in the \"Poetic Edda\" as \"Hamðismál\" and \"Guðrúnarhvöt\".

The shallow sky is space within the Solar System, plus the Earth's atmosphere. Sky phenomena such as planetary conjunctions, solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, as well as atmospheric phenomena like haloes, rainbows, and noctilucent clouds, are all occurring in the shallow sky.\n\n\"The Shallow Sky Bulletin\" (ISSN 0897-2532) was published by Stephen M. Smith from 1986 through 2000. Mr. Smith operated The Comet Rapid Announcement Service (CRAS) to disseminate notices about newly discovered bright comets, news about comets and daily positions (ephemerides) for observable comets. The common practice for publishing comet tables was to display positions at 10-day intervals. All of the comet position tables published in \"SSB\" were at 1-day intervals. During the 14-year run of \"SSB\", CRAS subscribers were informed about all observable comets.\n\nIn the 2006 April 13 issue of \"The Minor Planet Circulars/Minor Planets and Comets\", published by The Minor Planet Center of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Mr. Smith's work was honored by the naming of minor planet 9891 Stephensmith.\n"}

It is a fatty alcohol. Sulfate esters of lauryl alcohol, especially sodium lauryl sulfate, are very widely used as surfactants. Sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and sodium laureth sulfate are all used in shampoos. Lauryl alcohol is tasteless and colorless with a floral odor.\n\nIn 1993, the European demand of dodecanol was around 60 thousand tons per year (Tt/a). It can be obtained from palm kernel or coconut oil fatty acids and methyl esters by hydrogenation. It may also be produced synthetically via the Ziegler process. A classic laboratory method involves Bouveault-Blanc reduction of ethyl laurate.\n\nDodecanol is used to make surfactants, lubricating oils, pharmaceuticals, in the formation of monolithic polymers and as a flavor enhancing food additive. In cosmetics, dodecanol is used as an emollient. It is also the precursor to dodecanal, an important fragrance, and 1-bromododecane, an alkylating agent for improving the lipophilicity of organic molecules.\n\nDodecanol can irritate the skin. It has about half the toxicity of ethanol, but it is very harmful to marine organisms.\n\nThe mutual solubility of 1-dodecanol and water has been quantified as follows.\n\n"}

{"id": "2084170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084170", "title": "DrayTek", "text": "DrayTek\n\nDrayTek () is a manufacturer of broadband CPE (Customer Premises Equipment), including firewalls, VPN devices, routers and wireless LAN devices. The company was founded in 1997. Their earliest products included ISDN based solutions, the first being the ISDN Vigor128, a USB terminal adaptor for Windows and Mac OS. This was followed by the ISDN Vigor204 ISDN terminal adaptor/PBX and Vigor2000, their first router. Their head office is in Hsinchu, Taiwan with regional offices and distributors worldwide.\n\nDrayTek was one of the first manufacturers to bring VPN technology to low cost routers, helping with the emergence of viable teleworking. In 2004, DrayTek released the first of their VoIP (Voice-Over-IP) products which has become one of their key areas. In 2006, new products aimed at enterprises debuted, including larger scale firewalls and Unified Threat Management (UTM) firewalls products however the UTM Firewalls did not sell in sufficient volume and the UTM products ceased development and production. \n\nDrayTek's product line offers business and consumer DSL modems with support for the PPPoA standard compared to the more the widely supported PPPoE for use with full-featured home routers and home computers without more expensive ATM hardware. PPPoA is used primarily in the UK for ADSL lines. Most Vigor routers provide a virtual private network (VPN) endpoint connection, either as LAN-to-LAN (to another router endpoint elsewhere on the Internet) or as teleworker 'dial in' for a single remote device. In 2011, DrayTek added SSL VPN facilities into their range.\n\nAlthough DrayTek do produce some products using Linux (in common with many other vendors), most of their products are based around their own proprietary DrayOS operating system. Linux products includes the Vigor 3900, 2960 and the VigorAP wireless access points, though each of these relies on a large proportion of proprietary code.\n\nDrayTek was floated on the Taiwanese OTC securities market in 2001.\n\nDrayTek released the Vigor2200USB router in the UK in 2002, a unique router for ADSL, the only router able to be connected to BT's newly launched USB-modem based ADSL service. The router did not incorporate a modem, but allowed certain specified USB ADSL modems to be connected; at the time many Internet Service Providers required their USB modems to be used rather than allowing connection of ADSL equipment directly to the telephone line (\"wires-only\" service). The product was devised in the UK by SEG Communications and developed by DrayTek engineers. This was the only router supporting a separate USB modem, and was the only router compatible with BT's new USB ADSL service. These factors made it very popular and firmly established DrayTek as a key player in the broadband Internet hardware market in the UK.\n\nFor the UK market, DrayTek were granted MCT approval for their VDSL2 products in 2015, a mandatory requirement for products connected to the UK network operated by BT Openreach (used by most ISPs).\n\nDrayTek released the VigorSwitch V1281 in 2018, starting a new product category converging AV (Audio/visual) applications with IP Switching. The VigorSwitch V1281 was an Ethernet switch, specifically intended for switching IP based video feeds between sources (DVD/Blu-Ray players, Set-top boxes, CCTV etc) and outputs (screens/projectors). A companion app for Android/iOS allowed selections of sources. The VigorSwitch V1281 was designed by Michael Spalter and developed by DrayTek's engineers using their new switch operating system. The V1281 was compatible with various 3rd party HDMI-IP adaptors, as well as DrayTek's own HVE290. A scripting API allows integration with 3rd party home automatic system. The VigorSwitch V1281 was initially available in the UK only.\n\nVigorACS is DrayTek's own management system which allows the mass management, reporting and control of DrayTek product estates. It supports the latest generation of routers, wireless access points and Ethernet switches. DrayTek VigorACS can be run on customer's own servers, on commercial cloud hosted platforms or as a subscription on DrayTek's servers (available in various regions).\n\nThe Vigor 120 (for ADSL) and Vigor 130 (for ADSL and VDSL) were modems introduced to allow the connection of Ethernet-based routers/firewalls to DSL lines. Many such products do not have built-in DSL interfaces of their own, or need additional modem connectivity for multiple WAN ports. The Vigor 120 was devised in the UK where PPPoA was commonly used for ADSL and where the PPPoA-to-PPPoE bridging provided a transparent connection for the secondary router/firewall. As a BT (MCT/SIN498) approved device, the Vigor 130 also ensures compliant with Openreach rules which mandate that approved. In some regions, the Vigor 120/130 were developed further to add very basic router facilities (but without the feature set of the main router series).\n\nThis is an approximate chronological order of all major DrayTek products from 1997:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2084194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084194", "title": "Thundersley", "text": "Thundersley\n\nThundersley is a district and an ecclesiastical parish based on a manor of early origin in the north of the Castle Point Borough, in southeast Essex, England. The settlement, between the size of a typical village and town, is clustered and sits on clay ridge shared with Basildon and Hadleigh, 31 miles east of Charing Cross, London.\n\nIts main parish takes in Daws Heath to the east which is also part of the current \"Cedar Hall\" local government electoral ward. The two areas have Anglican churches. A third Anglican church is in the secular ward of \"St John's\", which is commonly conflated on maps with South Benfleet which it adjoins and it is separated from Thundersley by a narrow green buffer. Between the two wards is the main ward of \"St Peter's\", which loosely resembles the very longstanding church parish. One ward is partially in Thundersley, \"Boyce\" which includes Thundersley Green and various short streets next to the town itself.\n\nThundersley derives from the Old English \"Þunres lēah\" = \"grove or meadow [perhaps sacred] belonging to the god Thunor or Thor\". It has also historically been known as \"Thunresleam\". The place-name is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as \"Thunreslea\".\n\nThe place-name is historically significant as a survival from England's pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon paganism.\n\nThe area is relatively hilly for Essex, a typical height for the central and eastern part of (old) Thundersley is about above sea level. The district is partly rural, with large woods and commons; including Thundersley Common (a Site of Special Scientific Interest), Shipwrights Wood (12 hectares) and Thundersley Glen all owned and managed by the council; West Wood (22½ hectares acres) owned by the council and managed by Castle Point Wildlife Group; Tile Wood (6½ hectares) and Pound Wood (22¼ hectares) are owned by the Essex Wildlife Trust; Starvelarks Wood and Wyburns Wood are both part of Little Haven Nature Reserve (37¼ hectares) which is owned by Havens Hospice Trust and leased to Essex Wildlife Trust; Coombe Wood is under mixed ownership and much of it has Village Green status.\nThundersley is partly suburban, with large areas of housing, mostly built since c.1950, and small industrial parks.\n\nA clear majority of households in all wards are economically employed (or in self-employment). The proportion of people who are retired is slightly higher than the national average.\nThe wards have a high rate of owner-occupation. In the 2011 census tenure is stated for all 8570 wards of England and Wales, all of Thundersley's wards ranked between 236th and 341st as to this statistic (the degree to which the census returnees stated they owned their homes either outright or with a mortgage). Specifically these varied in owner-occupation between 87.5% and 88.6%, the average in the jurisdiction being 67.8%.\n\nSamuel Lewis (publisher)'s major work, a \"Topographical Dictionary of England\" in 1848 gives this account:\nTHUNDERSLEY (St. Peter), a parish, in the union of Billericay [...] S.[outh] division of Essex, 2¼ miles (S. W. by W.) from Rayleigh; containing 596 inhabitants, of whom 120 are in the hamlet. This parish is about two miles in length [east-west], and a mile and a half in breadth, and comprises 2100 acres, of which 100 are common or waste; the village is on elevated ground, and the surrounding scenery is pleasingly diversified. The [parish priest] living...[was] valued in the king's books at £14. 13. 4., and in the gift <nowiki>[</nowiki>appointment of the Rev. G. Hemming: the tithes have been commuted [near-eliminated] for £570; there is a parsonage-house, and the glebe comprises 40 acres. The church is a venerable structure in the later Norman and early English styles, with a tower and spire.\n\nThere are three secondary schools in the district – The King John School and Sixth Form, The Deanes School and The Appleton School and Sixth Form College. Five primary schools are Thundersley, Westwood, Kingston, Montgomerie, and Robert Drake. The main campus of SEEVIC Further Education College is also in the district, now part of USP College.\n\nSince the Local Government Act 1972, Thundersley, along with Canvey Island, Hadleigh, and South Benfleet, has formed the parliamentary constituency of Castle Point and local government district and borough of Castle Point.\n\nThundersley elects one councillor to Essex County Council. Within Castle Point Borough Council, Thundersley is represented by 12 councillors, all Conservative, elected from the wards (from west to east) of St George, St Peter and Cedar Hall.\n\nThe Parish of Thundersley includes Daws Heath. The western part of Thundersley (approximately St George's parish or the St George ward) is known as New Thundersley.\n\nThundersley is within the SS7 Postcode Area..\n\nThundersley is bounded by the A127 road to the north, where it borders the Borough of Rayleigh, the A130 road to the west where it borders the villages of North Benfleet and Bowers Gifford in the Borough of Basildon, the A13 road to the south (bordering the South Benfleet district of Castle Point), plus a triangular salient further southward as far as Benfleet Road and Thundersley Glen, and eastwards beyond the A129 road bordering through Daws Heath, Belfairs Park in the Leigh-on-Sea Borough of Southend-on-Sea, and Hadleigh, also within the borough. The nearest railway stations are Benfleet railway station and Rayleigh railway station. The London Tilbury and Southend LT&SR 79 Class 4-4-2T No. 80 locomotive \"Thundersley\" was named after this area, and it is on exhibition at Bressingham Steam and Gardens in Norfolk, on loan from the National Railway Museum. The district has no fixed speed enforcement cameras, but mobile ones are sometimes observed in Daws Heath Road about 0.5 miles east of The Woodmans Arms junction.\n\nThundersley Rovers Sports Club was formed in 1963 by local football fan Keith Walker. The Club was a founder member of the Thundermite League in 1966 and it is from the club that the league took part of its name. From those early beginnings the club grew exponentially and within a decade Rovers boasted no less than three senior teams (two Saturday and one Sunday) plus six youth teams (under 10s through to under 15s), all of whom played in the Southend Junior League.\n\nIn 1980, the club found a permanent home at Thundersley Common having played at various venues (including Woodside Park, the John Borrows Ground, Benfleet Rec., Dark Lane and Scrub Lane). The Common, now synonymous with the club, has remained the club's home ground ever since. Since the beginning of the 2012/13 season, it has been the home venue for both junior and senior Thundersley Rovers teams.\n\nAlthough officially named Thundersley Rovers Sports Club, the only sport the club has participated in thus far is football. In 2013, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\nGreeves motorcycles were produced in a purpose-built factory at Thundersley from 1953 to 1976. Initially the bikes were an offshoot of the Invacar company, which produced invalid cars and needed to diversify its products.\n\nThe bikes were exclusively two-stroke powered, using proprietary engines from Villiers and British Anzani initially and always for the roadsters, but by 1964 they had developed their own engine for competition use. For a few years, Greeves were successful in competition, with wins in the European Motocross Championship, the Manx Grand Prix, the European Trials Championship and the Scottish Six Days Trial, and with Gold medals in the ISDT and the ACU 250 cc Road Race.\n\nAir Training Corps Squadron - (1341) is based in Thundersley.\n\nThe Parish of Thundersley has three Anglican churches: St Peter's, Thundersley, St George's, New Thundersley and St Michael's, Daws Heath the original of which has been replaced by an enhanced timber church, consecrated by the Bishop of Bradwell on 1 December 2012.)\n\nFully reformed Christian churches include Thundersley Congregational Church which runs as its mission The Beacon, Thundersley Gospel Hall, Daws Heath Evangelical Church\nand Thundersley Community Church at Cedar Hall School.\n\nThundersley Christian Spiritualist Church was formed in October 1933 and moved to a wooden hut on Bread and Cheese Hill in July 1947. A new building opened at the same site in 2008.\n\nA movie memorabilia barber shop, is among the many unusual businesses of note.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although the manga is primarily a comedy, it includes several scenes of serious, gripping drama, and the first volume's plot and theme are solidly based in noir fiction.\n\nFor the sake of clarity and brevity, this article refers to the original 15-page \"Rising Stars of Manga\" entry as \"the short story\" and the full-tankōbon graphic novels as \"the books\". Like almost all \"original English-language manga\", \"Dogby Walks Alone\" is \"straight to tankōbon\", and never had its individual chapters serialized in a magazine.\n\nDogby, the protagonist of both stories, is an amusement park mascot who never speaks, and never removes the head from his costume (at least not anywhere the \"camera\" can see).

{"id": "2084233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084233", "title": "Roosevelt University", "text": "Roosevelt University\n\nRoosevelt University is a private university with campuses in Chicago, Peoria, and Schaumburg, Illinois. Founded in 1945, the university is named in honor of both former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nThe university enrolls around 6,000 students between its undergraduate and graduate programs. Roosevelt is also home to the Chicago College of Performing Arts. The university's newest academic building, Wabash, is located in The Loop of Downtown Chicago. It is the tallest educational building in Chicago, the second tallest educational building in the United States, and the fourth-largest academic complex in the world.\n\nThe university was founded in 1945 by Edward J. Sparling, the president of Central YMCA College in Chicago, after a dispute. He refused to provide his board with the demographic data of the student body, fearing the board would develop a quota system to limit the number of African Americans, Jews, immigrants, and women at the school. As a result, Sparling resigned under protest and took with him many faculty and students to start a new college. Faculty voted in favor 62 to 1, and students 488 to 2 for the school. In the beginning, the university had no library, campus, or endowment.\n\nThe new college was chartered as Thomas Jefferson College on March 28, 1945 and had financial backing from Marshall Field III, the Julius Rosenwald Foundation, the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, and numerous other individuals and organizations. Two weeks later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt died. The college obtained his widow Eleanor's permission to rename the institution as Roosevelt College in his memory.\n\nIn 1947, the college purchased the Auditorium Building for one dollar, and it became the permanent home. The college was rededicated to both Franklin and Eleanor in 1959. Early advisory board members included Marian Anderson, Pearl Buck, Ralph Bunche, Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann, Gunnar Myrdal, Draper Daniels, and Albert Schweitzer. In August 1996, the university opened its Albert A. Robin Campus in Schaumburg, after a donation from Albert A. Robin, an entrepreneur and immigrant.\n\nOn March 9, 2020, Robert Morris University Illinois merged with Roosevelt University. The integrated university continued under the name of Roosevelt University. Robert Morris added its majors to Roosevelt’s large portfolio of undergraduate and graduate programs under the name Robert Morris Experiential College, one of several colleges of Roosevelt University.\n\n\nChicago classes are held within Roosevelt's historic Auditorium Building at 430 S. Michigan Avenue, blocks from the Magnificent Mile. The Auditorium Building houses the Auditorium Theatre of Roosevelt University and numerous administrative offices for the university. A second downtown campus building is the Gage Building, located at 18 S. Michigan Avenue. It also houses the Gage Gallery and administrative offices for the College of Education, Manfred Steinfeld School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Paralegal Studies Program and the School of Communication.\nPro football's 2015 NFL Draft was held in the Auditorium on April 30, 2015, the league's first time hosting the draft in Chicago in more than 50 years.\n\nIn Spring 2010, construction began on a new building for the downtown campus, which was completed in Spring 2012. The 32-story vertical campus, the Wabash Building, is the second-tallest higher-education building in the United States and the sixth tallest in the world. It serves as a multipurpose building: housing student services, classrooms, contemporary science labs, administrative offices, and student residences. Student residences are on the top floors (14-32), with a shared lounge overlooking Lake Michigan on each floor. The university held an open house in the summer of 2012, with classes beginning in the new addition during the fall 2012 semester.\n\nThe Lillian and Larry Goodman Center, the first stand-alone facility for college athletics in Chicago's Loop, is the latest addition to Roosevelt University's downtown Chicago campus and serves as the home for Roosevelt Lakers athletics.\n\nRoosevelt University's campus in Schaumburg is the largest four-year university in Chicago's Northwest suburbs, serving approximately 2,500 students. The campus is located in the former headquarters office building of the Pure Oil Company. Roosevelt converted the building into a comprehensive campus in 1996. The Albert A. Robin Campus is home to the Doctor of Pharmacy program, which accepted its inaugural class in July 2011. Roosevelt's PharmD program is the Midwest's only three-year, year-round program of its kind. In July 2014, it achieved full accreditation for its Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum. The campus is also home to the University's only PhD program (Industrial-Organizational Psychology), which began in August 2012.\n\nLocated on 30 acres, the Schaumburg Campus is on the north side of Golf Road Illinois Route 58 across from the Woodfield Mall and near the intersection with Meacham Road (). Recently, campus administrators have created prairies on sections of the land for environmental and educational purposes.\n\nThe university offers undergraduate and graduate degrees through seven schools: \nChicago College of Performing Arts (Music Conservatory), Chicago College of Performing Arts (Theatre Conservatory), College of Arts & Sciences, College of Education, College of Pharmacy, Heller College of Business and Robert Morris Experiential College. In addition, the university operates a variety of centers and institutes.\n\nSocial justice, a cornerstone of Roosevelt's history and development, has been purposefully embedded into the school's curriculum and is part of every student's academic experience. Topics previously covered have included such issues as public versus private rights to use city parks, the impact of gentrification following urban modernization projects, and the impact one can have to preserve the earth's natural resources. Student-led research projects and theses have also touched areas such as gender equality and the effects of minimum wage on the economy.\n\nRoosevelt University currently has three residence hall options, including the new vertical campus. The new Wabash building serves as housing for all incoming freshmen and transfers. The University Center of Chicago is the other main residence hall, with apartment style options. It was officially opened in the fall of 2004 and is located at 525 S. State Street. The UCC houses students from Roosevelt University, DePaul University, and Columbia College Chicago, totaling 1700 residents from these three schools combined. The second residence hall is Fornelli Hall, with apartment-only options, located in the Pittsfield Building at 55 E. Washington Street, Chicago. It opened in the fall of 2008. It provides apartment-style housing for upperclassmen from Roosevelt and Robert Morris Universities.\n\nThe Herman Crown Center, located at 425 S. Wabash Avenue, Chicago, was the main residence hall for Roosevelt until it was closed in the spring of 2008. Like the Herman Crown Center, the new 32-story vertical campus is connected to the Auditorium Building and provides direct access between the two buildings.\n\nThere are many active student organizations at both of the Roosevelt University campuses. \n\nRoosevelt University sports teams, known as the Lakers, compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA); the university is a member of the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, and track and field; women's sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, and track and field. The Lakers announced in April 2020 their addition of football and men's/women's ice hockey that will begin play in the 2020–21 academic year, having been acquired from Robert Morris when they competed as the Eagles. The Lakers ice hockey teams joined the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) and inherited the Eagles' former ACHA affiliation.\n\nThe 20,000-capacity Toyota Park is the home of the Roosevelt Lakers soccer teams.\n\nRoosevelt University revived its athletic program after a 20-year absence in 2010. Roosevelt added women's volleyball for the 2011-12 academic year, followed by men's golf, men's and women's soccer, and softball for the 2012–13 academic year. The expansion of the university's athletics has brought the number of sport offerings from the initial seven sports to fourteen. After the 2020 merger, Roosevelt's acquisition of Robert Morris's football and men's/women's ice hockey teams was completed.\n\nThe Lillian and Larry Goodman Center is located at 501 S. Wabash Avenue, which is the southeast corner of the intersection known as Ida B. Wells Drive and Wabash Avenue. The Goodman Center is a two-story, 27,834-gross-square-foot field house featuring a multi-purpose gymnasium on the second floor and first-floor space containing offices, meeting rooms, a team lounge, locker rooms, an athletic training room, and a strength and conditioning center.\n\nThe lobby stairwell of the Auditorium Building (430 S.

The lobby was also the set of a nightclub scene in the 2009 film \"Public Enemies\".\n\nIn the summer of 2005, the Murray-Green Library on the 10th floor of the Auditorium Building was used as a set for the film \"The Lake House\", in which the room doubled as an architect's office.\n\nThe university's alumni includes many entertainers, academics, and politicians such as Anthony Braxton, Danitra Vance, and Harold Washington, while its first advisory board lists figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Albert Einstein.\n\n"}
{"id": "2084240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084240", "title": "Tribunat", "text": "Tribunat\n\nThe Tribunat was one of the four assemblies set up in France by the Constitution of Year VIII (the other three were the Council of State, the Corps législatif and the Sénat conservateur). It was set up officially on 1 January 1800 at the same time as the \nCorps législatif. Its first president was the historian Pierre Daunou, whose independent spirit led to his dismissal from the post by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. The Tribunat assumed some of the functions of the Council of Five Hundred, but its role consisted only of deliberating projected laws before their adoption by the Corps législatif, with the legislative initiative remaining with the Council of State.\n\nAs with elections to the Corps législatif, members of the Tribunat were not elected by direct universal suffrage. They were chosen via a complex process by the Senate from the \"national lists of notables\" (\"listes nationales de notabilités\") set up following a series of votes \"en cascade\" - the citizens would first elect \"communal notables\" from one tenth of their number, who would choose \"departmental notables\" from one tenth of their number, who would in turn choose \"national notables\" from another one tenth of their number.\n\nThe Tribunat's function was to send three orators to discuss proposed laws with government orators in the presence of the Corps législatif. It could not vote on such laws, but its decisions did have some consequence, if only as a consultative opinion, with the final decision always coming back as a last resort to the First Consul, who might or might not take the Tribunat's opinion into account. The Tribunat could also ask the Senate to overturn \"the lists of eligibles, the acts of the Legislative Body and those of the government\" on account of unconstitutionality, but the Tribunat's opinion was, once again, non-binding.\n\nShortly after the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire, the Tribunat became a focus of opposition to the regime the First Consul was in the process of setting up. Also, on 7 January, Benjamin Constant entered the Tribunat and, in a speech that made him leader of the opposition, denounced \"the regime of servitude and silence\" Bonaparte was preparing. The Tribunat was made up of liberal personalities like Constant, whose independent point of view Bonaparte saw as prejudicial to the public order and political unity he was trying to establish. Thus it was first purged after its opposition to the projected Code civil in 1802 (a purge made possible by a manoeuvre - the Tribunat was partially renewed at the regular interval, but it was unknown who in the Tribunat would be the first to be removed, and therefore Napoleon chose his opponents), then suppressed by a decree of the Senate in 1807, with its remaining functions and members absorbed into the Corps législatif.\n\nIt is notable that the Corps législatif tended to reinforce the powers of the executive. The introduction of the plebiscite, reducing the chambers' legitimacy and thus their power, had the same aim. The Tribunat was an organ intended to improve separation of powers, but the way that the separation of powers was structured did not let the Tribunat run effectively.\n\nThe Constitution of Year VIII organised the Tribunat:\n\nThe Constitution of 16 thermidor year X (4 August 1802) foresaw:\n\nThe Constitution of the Year XII stated that:\n\n"}

{"id": "2084259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084259", "title": "Wilhelma", "text": "Wilhelma\n\nThe Zoo and Botanical Garden have been staffed since 1846. The Moorish Revival style echoing the Alhambra have been maintained and supplemented since 1960. Today, the zoo has an area of about , houses around 11,500 animals from around the world composed of roughly 1,200 species and roughly 6000 plants from all climates. Of Germany's zoos, Wilhelma's collection ranks second to the Berlin Zoological Garden. In addition to the public garden, Wilhelma also has a branch office located in Fellbach, where the zoo keeps its stallions.\n\nWilhelma receives gorilla juveniles rejected by their mother and reared by the zookeepers. At age 2-3, the gorillas are sent back to their original zoo(s).\n\nIn 1829, the property the zoo stood near the mineral springs on the Castle Rosenstein estate. Then Duke William I of Württemberg decided to build a royal bathhouse in the gardens. The Duke decided that the bathhouse should be built in the Moorish style in the same fashion as the Alhambra in the Spanish province of Granada, with an attached Orangery. Unfortunately, construction ground to a halt in 1816 due to economic woes caused by the Year Without Summer, so Wilhelma became just another summer residence of the Dukes and later Kings of Württemberg. Ludwig von Zanth was hired in 1837 to design and construct the Duke's bathhouse.\n\n1842 saw the completion of the first few buildings of the Duke's bathhouse and the site received the name \"Wilhelma\". The imaginative von Zanth knew how to fire up the Duke's mind and thus was able to complete the Duke's summer villa, which consisted of a residential building, a domed hall and two neighboring greenhouses, each with a corner pavilion. In 1846, the marriage between Charles I of Württemberg and Olga Nikolaevna of Russia was celebrated at Wilhelma, which by now had a banquet hall, two main building with several courtrooms, several gazebos, greenhouses and a large park. The cottage would be finished 20 years later.\n\nThe abdication of King in 1918 saw Wilhelma pass into the possession of the city of Stuttgart and state of Baden-Württemberg. To this day it has been maintained by the Ministry of Finances. Wilhelma was opened to the public in 1919 as a botanical garden. A significant part of the zoo's income was the orchid collection, which brought in money by selling offspring from the garden (a practice at that time unique in Germany). The Imperial Garden Show of 1939 took place in Stuttgart at Wilhelma.\n\nWilhelma was badly damaged during World War Two Allied bombing raids during the night of October 19 and 20, 1944. The Garden and Orangery suffered extensive damage; the plants that had not been moved prior to prevent their destruction were either destroyed or heavily damaged. The then director of the gardens, Albert Schöchle wanted to restore the gardens but also had an idea to once again incorporate animals on the property.\n\n1949 saw the reopening ceremony that featured an aquarium. In 1950 a bird exhibit featuring cassowaries, a pheasant, rheas, ostriches, and birds of paradise was unveiled at Wilhelma. This exhibition was followed by the \"Animals of the German Fairy Tale\" in the same year. It featured such animals as brown bears, lions, various snakes including anacondas and pythons, and dinosaurs, giant turtles, and crocodiles. Another exhibit, \"Animals of the Plains of Africa,\" once again featured lions, crocodiles, antelopes, waterbucks, zebras, wildebeests, and giraffes. The \"Indian Jungle Exhibit\" was the most successful exhibit in the entire history of Wilhelma. The display included elephants, tigers, leopards, Asiatic black bears, and Macaques. Even though the state of Baden-Württemberg's Ministry of Finances ordered the animals from those exhibits removed, the order was never carried out. 1965 saw the founding of the Association of Friends and Supporters of Wilhelma.\n\n1960 was a good year for Wilhelma; the Stuttgart Council of Ministers approved expansions of the zoo, and this was approved by the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg 1961. New additions to the zoo included the renovation of King Wilhelm's Moorish villa into the exhibit for nocturnal animals in 1962, the construction of a new modern building and an aquarium in 1967, and buildings and exhibits for big cats, rhinos, and hippos in 1968. Then director Albert Schöchle retired in 1970 and was replaced by Wilbert Neugebauer. Under Neugebauer, a building for the zoo's monkeys completed in 1973, South American plants in 1977, hoofed African animals in 1982, Sub Tropics exhibit in 1981, and Youngstock House in 1982. Biologist Dieter Jauch became the third director in 1989, previously working as the curator of the aquarium. In Jauch's tenure, the previous system for bears and climbing animals was revised in 1991, the zoo's demonstration farm was completed in 1993, and a new aviary for the zoo's penguins and kangaroo enclosure were completed in the same year. Wilhelma's Amazon House was finished in 2000, the insectarium in 2001, the Bongo exhibit was expanded in 2003, Crocodile Hall was renovated in 2006, the Elephant enclosure was renovated in 2012, the meerkat hall was finished in 2013, and the African Apes Hall was opened that same year. Further work by Jauch included a new outdoor terrarium and the expansion of the bison enclosure in 2013. Thomas Kölpin became director in 2014. His tenure saw the conclusion of the renovation of the old palace into the nocturnal animals hall (1962–2014) with the aim to build an entirely new building for the zoo's nocturnal animals in Elephant Park, and the finishing of the small animals house (1968–2014).\n\nBy 1993, Wilhelma reached its current size. A new ape house was opened in May 2013 (construction cost 22 million euros). The redesigned exterior of the elephant enclosure was completed in April 2012. To make room for even more elephants, the rhinos will be moving to their previous enclosure. A new hippo plant on the Neckar with a new pedestrian crossing is in development. A collaboration with the Neckar-Käpt'n and the National Museum of Natural History on this topic is being discussed. Construction will connect Wilhelma to Stuttgart 21 and B10 tunnel; Wilhelma will serve as a railroad stop on the B10 route. Construction is to begin in September 2015. Another 20 year bill granting funds for further expansion to Wilhelma was put up for consideration by the Ministry of Finances was approved July 2015.\n\nThe Elephant and Rhino houses were completed in 1968, and ropes were later installed in 1990 to replace the chains. The grounds of both buildings were redesigned in 2012 to include trees and an animal friendly scrub basin, increasing its total size to . In addition, a clay wallows and two basins with interchangeable substrates (e.g. bark mulch, gravel.) were added. Currently, there are two living elephants at Wilhelma: \"Pama\" (1966) and Vella (1967). Previous elephants include Vilja, the oldest living elephant in Europe, died July 10, 2010 (cause of death is thought to be circulatory collapse), and \"Molly\", whom was euthanized in July 2011 at the age of about 45 years. Other elephants at the zoo include the African elephant \"Jumbo\" and, briefly, an Asian bull elephant sent by the Indian state as a gift to Stuttgart. Another construction project, announced in a speech, that will begin in 2020 is in the planning stages.\n\nWilhelma's rhinos, housed in the same building as the elephants, include:\"Bruno\", the bull, who was raised in Cologne, and until 2019 \"Sani\" who was given to Stuttgart by the Nepalese state as a gift in 1993. Together, they made up the current breeding pair. Before them, Wilhelma's Rhino breeding pair were \"Nanda\" and \"Puri\".\n\nThe Tapir House, built in the Expansion era in 1968, housed the pygmy hippo bull, \"Hannibal\", the hippos \"Rosi\" and \"Maik\"and some warthogs. The building houses today malayan tapirs and babirusas. \n\nThe plant complex for African ungulates which includes the giraffe house, was opened 1980th Today there live zebras, giraffes, kudus, okapi, Dorcas gazelle, Marabou stork and Somali wild ass. Wilhelma has been very successful in the breeding of giraffes, Somali wild asses, bongos, okapi, bontebok and zebras. Since 1989, a total of 12 okapi have arrived at Wilhelma. In the giraffe house there are not only the indoor enclosure of giraffe and okapi, but also the home of Congo peacocks, Fennec foxes, short-eared elephant shrews and weaver birds. Former residents include Grant's zebras, shoebills, porcupines, klipspringers, waterbucks, warthogs and numerous antelopes.\n\nThe \"Ranch\" that borders the Tapir House, new Ape House, and excavation site of the tunnel to Castle Rosenstein, was built as a temporary holding area in the 1980s. It houses takins and the zoo's bison, and an onager.\n\nThe old Ape House, opened in 1973, was one of the most modern of its kind at the time. The building's design, since copied by numerous other zoos and again mimicked in the new ape house, was characterized by features like the carousel-style design of the enclosure and the tiles that line them and the specialized support disks that allowed increased force distribution. The last two chimpanzees at Wilhelma were acquired in the summer of 2010 due to European Endangered Species Programme drive begun at Veszprém. Since the opening of the new ape house, the old house has been used exclusively for the zoo's orangutans. In 2011, it was announced that the zoo wished to remodel the enclosures of the orangutans, lutungs and gibbons.\n\nWhen the old ape house (built in 1973) no longer met international standards, Wilhelma had to build a new ape house. In Spring of 2010, the project began to not only meet international standards, but to also include housing for gorillas and bonobos in an outdoor area. The new building, 13 times the size of the original structure at , was opened to the public on May 14, 2013. Construction of the New Ape House wound up costing the zoo about 22 million euros, 70% more than the original 9.5 million euros financed towards the project. The unfortunate deaths of two bonobos thanks to malfunctioning components in the ventilation system have called the construction quality of the building into question.\n\nThe Monkey facility, opened in 1973, now houses both gibbons and lutungs. Here, Wilhelma's breeding program for the Slim monkey is remarkable among other zoos in the world at 37 new pups. 2015 saw some remodeling done to the gibbons enclosure for visitor convenience. The building has housed Proboscis monkeys, Lion-tailed macaques, Drills, Doucs, and Spider and Capuchin monkeys.\n\nSince 1975, two other structures for (originally) housing primates were reconstructed. The larger of the two now houses Geladas, hyraxes, and Barbary sheep. The other still houses Japanese macaques.\n\nThe first major expansion to Wilhelma's collection of birds began with the Sub Tropics Aviary in 1981 that houses kookaburras, Marbled ducks, Northern bald ibises, numerous species of parrot. A special feature of the aviaries is the only New Zealand kaka outside of New Zealand and the first successful breeding of a Kea in Germany. Due to the strain put on the historic wall of the Sub Tropic Aviary by the New Ape House, a new project for a larger aviary is pending.\n\nThere are several aviaries behind Damascene Hall that were once used for Pheasantry when Wilhelma was still a palace for the King of Württemberg. In the post war period, these were used for housing small predatory animals including Canines, small cats, and civets. Since the restoration of the aviaries in the 1990s, they now hold native birds such as partridges, Eurasian bullfinchs, sparrows, and various pigeon species. In 2015, a modification was made to these aviaries to house capercaillies for Wilhelma's in situ participation of Species protection in the Black Forest region.\n\nFor the 1993 World Horticultural Exposition, a new enclosure for African penguins (who had been at Wilhelma since 1953) to replace their old habitat in the Garden's ponds near the Moorish villa adjacent to the bird aviary. There also were located Humboldt, Rockhopper, Gentoo, and King penguins. Public feedings occur daily.\n\nIn 1993, an aviary for birds from all over the world was constructed. Included are Black storks, ibises, Great hornbills, and an Asian and Australian community aviary that contains a Microbat exhibit and feeding kitchen.\n\nWilhelma's collection of cranes began with a bird exhibition in 1950: Redcrowned, Blue, and White-naped cranes and also a Hawaiian goose joined Wilhelma. Birds that used to have a presence at the zoo include other types of cranes, shoebills, geese, and curiously a Brush kangaroo.\n\n\n\n\"Warning: Most of these notes are in German.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2084265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084265", "title": "Unmarked grave", "text": "Unmarked grave\n\nAn unmarked grave is one that lacks a marker, headstone, or nameplate indicating that a body is buried there. However, in cultures that mark burial sites, the phrase unmarked grave has taken on a metaphorical meaning.\n\nAs a figure of speech, a common meaning of the term \"unmarked grave\" is consignment to an ignominious end. A grave monument (or headstone) is a sign of respect or fondness, erected with the intention of commemorating and remembering a person.\n\nConversely, a deliberately unmarked grave may signify disdain and contempt. The underlying intention of some unmarked graves may be to suggest that the person buried is not worthy of commemoration, and should therefore be completely ignored and forgotten, e.g., Seung-Hui Cho and Adam Lanza.\n\nUnmarked graves have long been used to bury executed criminals as an added degree of disgrace. Similarly, many 18th and 19th century prisons and mental asylums historically used numbered (but otherwise featureless) markers in their inmate cemeteries, which allowed for record-keeping and visitations while also minimizing the shame associated with having one's family name on permanent display in such a disreputable context. Plot E at Oise-Aisne American Cemetery (consisting entirely of soldiers executed for rape and/or murder) is a rare example of this policy persisting into the 20th century. More recently, the practice has been to cremate and secretly scatter the ashes of notorious criminals in some anonymous place. This was the fate of Nazi war criminals such as Adolf Eichmann, Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler, Fritz Sauckel, and Julius Streicher. The remains of British serial killers Myra Hindley, Dr Harold Shipman, and Fred West were treated in the same way. The headstone of disgraced television presenter and sex offender Jimmy Savile was removed and destroyed three weeks after being erected, when posthumous allegations of sexual abuse over decades came to light. Cremation and secret scattering of the ashes has the additional effect of removing all possibility of there being a grave to visit in the future.\n\nIn Judaism, contact with a corpse confers uncleanness (see Numbers 19:11-22 and Tractate Oholoth in the Mishna). Cohanim, descendants of Aaron, are prohibited from approaching within 4 cubits of a grave, except for when a funeral is of a close relative. Thus, an unmarked grave opens up the possibility that a pious Jew could become defiled without being aware that it happened. The Jews of early times, therefore, sought to avoid unmarked graves by two means: clearly designating cemeteries beyond the limits of their villages and cities, and making graves and tombs obvious by whitewashing them. This is the background for Jesus' comparison of the Pharisees of his time to white-washed tombs (see Matthew 23:27-28) and to \"unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it\" (Luke 11:44). Jesus warned that the Pharisees were defiling others by their hypocrisy, misplaced priorities, and selfish ambition.\n\nHowever, disdain and contempt are not the only reasons why graves remain unmarked.\n\nAs Alicia Hoyt reports: \"Historically, financial limitations and social status were factors in whether a person (even a famous one) was awarded a big fancy marker. Mass, unmarked graves were also common in times of widespread disease or war; plus older markers simply deteriorated over time or were stolen. Another reason might be: other gravesites reflect the wishes of the deceased or family members who simply don't want a marker, can't decide on wording, or plan to add one down the line when a loved one passes away and joins them in the plot. [sources: Texas Historical Commission, \"Washington Post\"]\"\n\nAdditionally, \"modern celebrity concerns\" may be related to a desire for privacy or to avoid vandalism. For example, basketball legend Kobe Bryant and daughter Gianna (whose grave sites lacks a headstone), Academy Award-winning actor George C. Scott, musician Frank Zappa, comedian John Belushi, and writer H. P. Lovecraft (discussed below) are notable people whose burial sites have been left unmarked (or marked deceptively) for reasons that are not financial.\n\nIn cases when a person's remains are lost, a cenotaph may be erected. This is what happened to comedian John Belushi. The gravestone at his grave in a Martha's Vineyard cemetery was removed and relocated, after operators of the cemetery found many signs of vandalism and rowdiness, where his body lies. In response, a cenotaph gravestone was erected at a nearby empty grave, to deter disrespectful visitors, leaving his actual final resting place without a marker. Another John Belushi cenotaph gravestone was erected by his family in a Chicago area cemetery, at the Belushi family plot, where his parents are now buried. Similarly, when H. P. Lovecraft's headstone in Providence, Rhode Island was stolen, a replacement marker was erected in a different location.\n\nDeceased monarchs and princes of Saudi Arabia are buried in unmarked graves in the public Al Oud cemetery in Riyadh. There is also typically no public funeral or national show of mourning. The Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam practiced in Saudi Arabia considers public shows of grief or memorials to the dead to be un-Islamic, and therefore the royal family typically practices austere, private burials.\n"}

It is the first season of \"The Real World\" to be filmed in the East North Central States region of the United States, specifically in Illinois.\n\nThe season featured seven people who lived in a converted bookstore/coffeehouse in the Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood, which production started from June 28 until November 3, 2001. This was also the first season in which production would start months (sometimes weeks) after wrapping the previous season allowing filming and broadcasting almost immediately unlike the usual annual season. The season premiered on January 15, 2002 and consisted of 24 episodes. This was the first of two seasons to be filmed in Chicago. Twelve years later, the show returned to the city in its .\n\nThe season depicted cast members dealing with learning of the September 11th attacks, although criticism was leveled at the series, as the cast was actually at Wrigley Field for a photo shoot when they learned of the event. However contrary to rumors this was not staged,\nit is just that producers brought a television in to the loft to see the attack footage to inform them and for their reactions.\n\nBunim-Murray Productions experienced a number of problems with the production of this season, including a nearby shooting, and numerous protests, vandalism, and arrests by locals critical of MTV and its parent company, Viacom, and opposed to the production's perceived contribution to the neighborhood's gentrification.\n\nThis was the first season of \"The Real World\" to feature two openly gay cast members, Chris Beckman and Aneesa Ferreira. A previous season, \"\", featured two LBGT cast members: Justin Deabler, who is gay, and Ruthie Alcaide, who is bisexual.\n\nAlmost every season of \"The Real World\", beginning with its , has included the assignment of a season-long group job or task to the housemates, continued participation in which has been mandatory to remain part of the cast since the Back to New York season. The Chicago roommates were assigned to three different jobs at the Chicago Park District. Some were lifeguards at the Lake Michigan beaches while others worked with inner-city children on a park mural. The cast then worked on \"Chicagoween\" (a portmanteau of \"Chicago\" and \"Halloween\") and had to devise a story to act out for the children at Chicago's Halloween celebration.\n\nThe cast resided in a loft at 1934 W. North Avenue in the Chicago neighborhood of Wicker Park, which had formerly served as a sweatshop, storage facility, and, after falling into disrepair in the 1980s, a drug den. After it was renovated, it served as Urbis Orbis Café, a classic hipster hangout, then an antique shop. Chicago Scenic Studios constructed the loft's interior, and interior decorating was overseen by local designer Suhail. After filming, fixtures and other items used during the production were auctioned off, and the space was converted into a Cheetah Gym, which opened in 2002.\n\nAfter the cast left the \"Real World\" loft, all seven of them appeared to discuss their experiences both during and since their time on the show, \"Stop Being Polite: The Real World Chicago Reunion\", which premiered on July 15, 2002, and was hosted by television personality Brian McFayden.\n\nAt the 2008 \"The Real World Awards Bash\", Chris received a nomination in the \"Hottest Male\" category, while Cara received one for \"Biggest Playa\".\n\nAfter the show, Kyle Brandt starred as Phillip Kiriakis on \"Days of Our Lives\" on NBC.

{"id": "2084272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084272", "title": "TAO (software)", "text": "TAO (software)\n\nThe ACE ORB (TAO) is a freely available, open-source, and standards-compliant real-time C++ implementation of CORBA based upon the Adaptive Communication Environment (ACE). It attempts to provide efficient, predictable, and scalable quality of service (QoS) end-to-end. TAO applies the best software practices and patterns to automate the delivery of high-performance and real-time QoS to distributed applications. TAO is for developers of distributed and embedded applications who have stringent performance demands.\n\nCertain real-time applications have benefited from TAO's use of familiar software concepts to present a solution to challenging real-time software problems. In general, real-time systems require predictable timing characteristics and robustness since they are used in mission-critical domains. Other real-time applications require low development cost and fast time to market. TAO addresses both of these by providing an already-implemented general-purpose communications framework that uses concepts familiar to non-real-time portions of the software industry.\n\nTraditionally, the barrier to viable real-time CORBA has been that many real-time challenges are associated with end-to-end system design aspects that transcend the layering boundaries traditionally associated with CORBA. That's why TAO integrates the network interfaces, OS I/O subsystem, ORB, and middleware services in order to provide an end-to-end solution. For instance, consider the CORBA Event Service, which simplifies application software by supporting decoupled suppliers and consumers, asynchronous event delivery, and distributed group communication. TAO enhances the standard CORBA Event Service to provide important features, such as real-time event dispatching and scheduling, periodic event processing, efficient event filtering and correlation mechanisms, and multicast protocols required by real-time applications.\n\nTAO brings familiar concepts from elsewhere in the software industry to real-time systems. These concepts include CORBA, RPC, an OO presentation, and Berkeley-sockets. In OO, RPC is usually termed “remote method invocation” (RMI), because subroutines or procedures that are directly associated with objects or classes are termed methods, but the concept is fundamentally the same in that the caller at the origin is suspended while the method at the destination object executes. This provides a simplicity of execution of software that can be desirable when subroutine is the idiom that is intended in the design or architecture.\n\nTAO, like all CORBA implementations, presents an OO RMI interface to the application. Invoking a subroutine suspends the execution of the superior who is delegating the operation and transfers the sole right to execute to the invoked method at the destination object, the subordinate to which the operation was delegated. Perhaps the caller could go on and perform other activities during that delegated operation, but the caller is suspended, awaiting the final accomplished result from the subordinate.\n\nThis becomes especially troublesome when the superior and subordinate are on different processors. Because the superior is suspended and only the subordinate is actively executing, two threads on two processors are occupied in the accomplishment of a single delegated operation. Typically, the counter-measure to this when using RMI/RPC is to increase the number of threads in the superior to match the desired total number of concurrent operations throughout the set of all subordinates. The resources consumed by a thread are typically greater than the resources consumed by communicating each delegated operation to the subordinate. Thus the overhead of concurrency is multiplied when using an RPC/RMI approach when compared to the approach of allowing the superior to continue executing to perform other tasks.\n\nThe alternative used by competitors to CORBA is simply to forgo the subroutine model so that the superior continues to execute concurrently with the delegated operations. The superior simply prepares a message that is sent to the subordinate. The subordinate immediately acknowledges the receipt of the message that requests the accomplishment of the delegated operation (without yet starting to accomplish the delegated operation itself). The superior then goes about other business, such as preparing messages for other delegated operations either to that same subordinate or to other subordinates. Each subordinate that has been delegated an operation, enqueues the operation's requesting message in a message queue that corresponds to the message's priority or deadline. A thread (perhaps in a thread pool) dequeues that message from that queue to accomplish the delegated operation. Upon accomplishment, the result is sent as a different message to the superior. The superior processes the result messages similarly to the way the subordinate processed the delegation messages.\n\nTAO provides this alternative through the asynchronous method invocation (AMI) and Asynchronous Method Handling (AMH) mechanisms. AMI is used by clients to make remote invocations without blocking for a response, the reply is received as a callback. AMH is used by servers to delay sending responses, for example, if the server itself needs to wait for other remote calls. AMI is part of the CORBA standard. AMH is a TAO extension to the CORBA specification.\n\nTAO can be downloaded from the Internet and freely used and redistributed without developer or run-time licensing costs. Commercial support, documentation, training, and consulting for TAO are available from multiple vendors. Many other third-party tools and services have also been integrated with TAO. Remedy IT created an extension for TAO called TAOX11 which adds support for the IDL to C++11 Language Mapping to TAO. TAOX11 is available for free as open source product.\n\nTAO has been ported to many operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Embedded systems such as VxWorks and LynxOS, high end systems like OpenVMS, and Unix systems such as Solaris and Linux.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2084276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084276", "title": "Cadmium telluride", "text": "Cadmium telluride\n\nCadmium telluride (CdTe) is a stable crystalline compound formed from cadmium and tellurium. It is mainly used as the semiconducting material in cadmium telluride photovoltaics and an infrared optical window. It is usually sandwiched with cadmium sulfide to form a p–n junction solar PV cell. Typically, CdTe PV cells use a n-i-p structure.\n\nCdTe is used to make thin film solar cells, accounting for about 8% of all solar cells installed in 2011. They are among the lowest-cost types of solar cell, although a comparison of total installed cost depends on installation size and many other factors, and has changed rapidly from year to year. The CdTe solar cell market is dominated by First Solar. In 2011, around 2 GW of CdTe solar cells were produced; For more details and discussion see cadmium telluride photovoltaics.\n\nCdTe can be alloyed with mercury to make a versatile infrared detector material (HgCdTe). CdTe alloyed with a small amount of zinc makes an excellent solid-state X-ray and gamma ray detector (CdZnTe).\n\nCdTe is used as an infrared optical material for optical windows and lenses and is proven to provide a good performance across a wide range of temperatures. An early form of CdTe for IR use was marketed under the trademarked name of \"Irtran-6\" but this is obsolete.\n\nCdTe is also applied for electro-optic modulators. It has the greatest electro-optic coefficient of the linear electro-optic effect among II-VI compound crystals (r=r=r=6.8×10 m/V).\n\nCdTe doped with chlorine is used as a radiation detector for x-rays, gamma rays, beta particles and alpha particles. CdTe can operate at room temperature allowing the construction of compact detectors for a wide variety of applications in nuclear spectroscopy. The properties that make CdTe superior for the realization of high performance gamma- and x-ray detectors are high atomic number, large bandgap and high electron mobility ~1100 cm/V·s, which result in high intrinsic μτ (mobility-lifetime) product and therefore high degree of charge collection and excellent spectral resolution. Due to the poor charge transport properties of holes, ~100 cm/V·s, single-carrier-sensing detector geometries are used to produce high resolution spectroscopy; these include coplanar grids, Frisch-collar detectors and small pixel detectors.\n\n\nBulk CdTe is transparent in the infrared, from close to its band gap energy (1.5 eV at 300 K, which corresponds to infrared wavelength of about 830 nm) out to wavelengths greater than 20 µm; correspondingly, CdTe is fluorescent at 790 nm. As the size of CdTe crystals are reduced to a few nanometers or less, thus making them CdTe quantum dots, the fluorescence peak shifts through the visible range into the ultraviolet.\n\nCdTe is insoluble in water. CdTe has a high melting point of 1041 °C with evaporation starting at 1050 °C. CdTe has a vapor pressure of zero at ambient temperatures. CdTe is more stable than its parent compounds cadmium and tellurium and most other Cd compounds, due to its high melting point and insolubility.\n\nCadmium telluride is commercially available as a powder, or as crystals. It can be made into nanocrystals.\n\nThe compound CdTe has different qualities than the two elements, cadmium and tellurium, taken separately. Toxicity studies show that CdTe is less toxic than elemental cadmium. CdTe has low acute inhalation, oral, and aquatic toxicity, and is negative in the Ames mutagenicity test. Based on notification of these results to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), CdTe is no longer classified as harmful if ingested nor harmful in contact with skin, and the toxicity classification to aquatic life has been reduced. Once properly and securely captured and encapsulated, CdTe used in manufacturing processes may be rendered harmless. Current CdTe modules pass the U.S. EPA’s Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test, designed to assess the potential for long-term leaching of products disposed in landfills.\n\nA document hosted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health dated 2003 discloses that:\n\nBrookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) are\nnominating Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) for inclusion in the National Toxicology Program (NTP). This nomination is strongly supported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and First Solar Inc. The material has the potential for widespread applications in photovoltaic energy generation that will involve extensive human interfaces. Hence, we consider that a definitive toxicological study of the effects of long-term exposure to CdTe is a necessity.\nResearchers from the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have found that large-scale use of CdTe PV modules does not present any risks to health and the environment, and recycling the modules at the end of their useful life completely resolves any environmental concerns. During their operation, these modules do not produce any pollutants, and, furthermore, by displacing fossil fuels, they offer great environmental benefits. CdTe PV modules that use cadmium as a raw material appear to be more environmentally friendly than all other current uses of Cd. CdTe PV provides a sustainable solution to a potential oversupply of cadmium in the near future. Cadmium is generated as a waste by-product of zinc refining and is generated in substantial amounts regardless of its use in PV, due to the demand for steel products.\n\nAt the present time, the price of the raw materials cadmium and tellurium are a negligible proportion of the cost of CdTe solar cells and other CdTe devices. However, tellurium is a relatively rare element (1–5 parts per billion in the Earth's crust; see Abundances of the elements (data page)). Through improved material efficiency and increased PV recycling systems, the CdTe PV industry has the potential to fully rely on tellurium from recycled end-of-life modules by 2038. See Cadmium telluride photovoltaics for more information. Another study shows that CdTe PV recycling will add a significant secondary resource of Te which, in conjunction with improved material utilization, will enable a cumulative capacity of about 2 TW by 2050 and 10 TW by the end of the century.\n\n"}

The island was sighted in 1768 by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville and explored 1793 by French explorer Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux.\nMisima island owes its name to , which was a lieutenant of the Counter admiral Antoine Bruny d'Entrecasteaux during his of scientific exploration.\nIn 1888 the British Empire annexed Misima Island, and it became part of British New Guinea (since 1904 - the Territory of Papua administered by Australia).\n\nGold was discovered on Misima late in 1888. By March 1889, eighty men were on the island digging for gold, and a storekeeper had set up a business.\n\nSince 1975, Misima belongs to the independent state of Papua New Guinea.\nA gold and silver mine was opened on the island in 1990, by an international corporation. \nThe mines provided plenty of work for the islanders. however, that mine was officially closed in 2004, because of excessive load on the environment and public health hazards.\n\nThe island is within the Samarai Murua District.\n\nThe island measures 40 km by 10 km and has an area of 214,5 km². It is located some 20 km north of the northwest extreme of the barrier reef of Vanatinai at Isu Raua Raua Island, and 80 km northwest of Vanatinai Island itself. \n\nMisima is mountainous and densely forested. Mt. Koia Tau, at a height of 1,036 meters, is the highest peak of the Louisiade Archipelago. \n\nIt was not until 24 December 2016 when Kolbe Bare, a Papua New Guinean geologist, and two Misimans, David Kaliton and Kaliton Ada, made the first recorded ascent to the Top of Oia Tau.[4] It was noted by Kolbe that even though the mountain is close to the sea, Higher altitude vegetation covers the top of the mountain at the time of ascent.\n\nThe local climate is tropical, moderated by northeast trade winds, with a dry season from 1 December to 31 May, and a wet season from 1 June to 30 November. it is usually very humid. Since it is fairly close to the equator, the temperature does not fluctuate much between winter and summer.\n\nMisima island is known as a mining island. A huge mine operated many years on the island. The mine was a joint venture by Placer Dome Inc (owning 80%) and the state-owned Orogen Minerals Ltd. In March 2012 Barrick closed its post closure monitoring office in Bwagaoia having successfully rehabilitated the mine and mill sites.\n\nSince 2004 when the mine closed, artisanal mining has become a major source of income in the island, with an association Misima Alluvial Gold Mining Association (MAGMA) starting in 2007. Other sources of income, especially for people living on the north coast, are cash crops of coconuts, copra, and cacao. A commercial fisheries project has been proposed, but has not been developed yet.\n\nThe island has a population of 19,330, spread across 78 villages, Misima is the most heavily populated island in the Louisiade Archipelago. By area, it is the third largest, after Vanatinai and Rossel Island.\nSince the mines have closed, there are signs of population decrease. people are moving to Alotau for jobs.\n\nThe main town of the island and the seat of the district is Bwagaoia, located on the southeast corner of the island. Other villages are Hinauta, Boiou, Gulewa, Bagilina, Liak, Siagara, Eiaus (on the eastern north coast, reachable by road from Bwagaoia), Gulewa and Ewena (on the western north coast), and Bwagabwaga, Gaibobo and Alhoga (on the south coast).\n\nAbout half the population identified themselves as members of a Christian church. see Religion in Papua New Guinea for more info.\n\nThe main language of the island is also called Misiman, though many residents speak English and also Tok Pisin as a third language.\n\nMisima has a working airport (four flights weekly to the mainland (POM via Alotau) through Airlines of Papua New Guinea, and one charter run by Porgera Joint Venture, a high school (grades 7-12), a small market, a few small stores and a clinic/hospital, a post office,--all of which are located in Bwagaoia. There are ferries from Alotau which service Misima Island, costing around K100 and taking 17 hours.\n\nThe following mammals are present on Misima Island:\n\nOther animals:\n\n"}

The first volume became available in October 2005, the second was released in November 2006, and the third was released on July 2008.\n\n\"Mark of the Succubus\" revolves around Aiden Landis, a normal 17-year-old boy, mild-tempered and indecisive, who’s never certain about what he wants for himself. His father wants him to be a lawyer while his girlfriend wants him to change for her own social desires. His teachers are all convinced that he could be a top student if he'd only stop daydreaming. Aiden just wants to play his guitar and, perhaps, write a meaningful song. Then he meets Maeve, a succubus-in-training.\n\nMaeve is a young succubus who hasn't yet gotten her license. She goes down to the human world nervously, enthralled by all she sees there- especially art and a certain teenaged human named Aiden Landis, who seems just as infatuated with her as she is with him. Maeve soon meets Aiden's quirky best friend, Devin, and his snobby, superficial girlfriend, Sandra, and learns about the wonders and perils of the human world.\n\nHowever, things may not go as smoothly as planned for Maeve. There is a demon on her tail who will do anything in her power to catch Maeve breaking the Rules of the demonworld, all in order to increase her own wealth and social status. What's more, Maeve must decide whom to place her deadly Mark upon- the Mark that inhabits the body of the first human she will kill.\n\nShe's not sure how to dress, or talk, or act around humans- and what's more, she isn't sure that she'd like to seduce and kill one. Which could prove a difficulty for her, as that is exactly the reason that she's being sent to mingle with humans in the first place. And when she ends up falling in love with the same mortal that she's placed her Mark on, sentencing him to die, only trouble can result from such a blatant breaking of demon law.\n\nIntent and studious, but a little absentminded, Maeve tends to stand out among demons and humans alike. Her quirky habits mark her as someone just learning the ways of a culture, and her utter inability to lie convincingly adds to the peculiar image. Despite her training, she often forgets what she's meant to be doing among the humans and loses herself in the fun of the moment.\n\nIndecisive, mild-tempered, and a bit withdrawn, Aiden rarely protests when others make his decisions for him, drifint along in whateverdirection he's pushed with no real enthusiasm. Al he really wants to do is play guitar but only his best friend knows he's good at it: instead he puts a weak effort into things he doesn't truly care about, avoiding conflict at the expense of his own dreams.\n\n\nFor most, Veril is a walking paradox. He has no qualms about seducing and killing humans, blackmailing superiors, or playing dirty to get his own way. At the same time however he has a strong sense of justice, and is fiercely loyal to those very few that are close to him. When his peculiar sense of is added to the mix, the incubus often comes across as a puzzle that is nearly impossible to figure out.\nVeril is an older brother/father figure to Maeve, whom he took in as his own when she was an infant or toddler. He cares deeply for her and will go to extreme lengths to keep her safe.\n\nLoud and quite purposefly obnoxious to anyone he doesn't like, Devin is considered something of an oddball including those closest to him. His love of science fiction and conspiracy theories has left more than one person wondering whether his somewhat far-fetched personal conjectures are real or just for fun\n\nCharming, intelligent, and collected, there isn't much about Sylne not to like - on the surface, at least. Underneath, the woman's hand is always in some sort of scheme, and she's willing to sacrifice even those closest to her in an effort to gain more power. She's two-faced and underhanded, two very good things for a succubus to be.\nDesiring a certain title, and the power, fortune, and recognition that comes with it, Sylne placed an illegal Human Spell on the Imp, Junael, forcing him t spy on her old student, Maeve, expecting the girl's nature would cause the younger succubus to slip just enough to use for her own selfish purposes.\nSylne is the top succubus in Erebus, a title she inherited from the prior top succubus (whose death Sylne arranged), and once had an intimate relationship with Veril but they grew apart.\n\nSomewhat reserved, Junael is the sort who prefers to handle things behind the scenes. He's meticulously neat and pays close attention to detail; usually, he knows more about any given situation than he lets on. though his work requires him to make sure the rules are followed, he's found that knowing them well enough allows them to be bent when the time clls for it. \nHe becomes a pawn of Sylne who places on him illegal Human Magic to control him, and he's forced to spy on Maeve, looking for any slip-ups or breaking the rules. He turns on Sylne and aids Maeve.\n\nWritten by Ashly Raiti and illustrated by Irene Flores, \"Mark of the Succubus\" was published by Tokyopop in three volumes from November 8, 2005 to July 9, 2008.

{"id": "2084339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084339", "title": "Steve Dalachinsky", "text": "Steve Dalachinsky\n\nSteven Donald Dalachinsky (September 29, 1946 – September 16, 2019) was an American downtown New York City poet, active in the music, art, and free jazz scenes. He wrote poetry for most of his life and read frequently at Michael Dorf's club the Knitting Factory, the Poetry Project and the Vision Festival, an Avant-jazz festival held annually on the Lower East Side of New York City. Dalachinsky also read his works in Japan, France and Germany. He collaborated with many musicians, writing liner notes for artists: William Parker, Susie Ibarra, Matthew Shipp, Roy Campbell, Daniel Carter, Sabir Mateen, Jim O'Rourke and Mat Maneri\n\nDalachinsky authored numerous books including a compendium of poetry written while listening to saxophonist Charles Gayle perform throughout New York City, and a collection of poems which focused on his time as a superintendent at an apartment building in Soho. Along with pianist Matthew Shipp, he co-authored the book \"Logos and Language: A Post-Jazz Metaphorical Dialogue\" and collaborated with French photographer Jacques Bisceglia on \"Reaching Into The Unknown\". His spoken word albums include \"Incomplete Directions\" and a collaboration with Shipp on the album \"Phenomena of Interference\". Dalachinsky's works also appeared in several journals and anthologies as well.\n\nHe received the Franz Kafka Prize, Acker Award, PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award and was nominated for a 2015 Pushcart Prize. He lived in Manhattan with his wife, painter and poet Yuko Otomo.\n\nDalachinsky was born in 1946, Brooklyn, New York, \"right after the last big war and has managed to survive lots of little wars\", which is how he is frequently described. He grew up in the Midwood section of the borough that was mostly an Italian and Jewish neighborhood with parents that were working class. Dalachinsky said he was \"always writing\" at an early age and was also \"involved in art\". His earliest notebooks of his writings that have survived go back to when he was between the ages of 13 and 15. He was once kicked out of a Hebrew school because he was \"wearing a cross\", and hung out with the Italian kids in the neighborhood which \"framed his perception of being Jewish\", according to him.\n\nDalachinsky started taking art lessons at the Pratt Institute where for 18 months he first attempted his hand at painting, eventually turning to writing poetry full-time. It was during this period in his life when he discovered beat poetry and found the poetry scene in Manhattan. He was given copies of Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s \"A Coney Island of the Mind\" and Allen Ginsberg’s \"Howl\", which he says changed his style of writing. Dalachinsky was also influenced by the writings of Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Ezra Pound, Delmore Schwartz, Federico Garcia Lorca, and William Blake, especially the work \"Auguries of Innocence\" by Blake. Besides writers, he counted obsession, socio-political angst, human disappointment, jazz music and abstract visual art among his influences. Dalachinsky related that writing process was as if \"spontaneity mixed with a conscious pushing\" and a \"descriptive transformation\". His works have been portrayed as leaning towards \"transforming the image rather than merely describing it\".\n\nFor 19 years, starting in the 1980s, he wrote some of his poems while listening to live jazz music, going to free jazz saxophonist Charles Gayle's performances, creating poems on scraps of paper. In 2006, Dalachinsky published a book of poems devoted entirely to Gayle, with the poems appearing chronologically in the order of the venues where Gayle performed at. The collection was honored in 2007 with a PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award. The book is also unusual because not only is it documenting the music, but also Dalachinsky's state of mind at the precise moment of capturing a musical phrase. Sometimes when Gayle's performance came with a sermon or lecture, commenting on topics like abortion or racial separatism, Dalachinsky would react with his poems reflecting the mood:\nDalachinsky also released a collection of poems, titled \"A Superintendent’s Eyes\", , which focused on his time as a superintendent at a Spring Street apartment building in Soho. It was published by The Unbearables, whom both him and his wife have a connection with, and describe themselves as a \"loose collective of noir humorists, beer mystics, anarchists, neophobes and passionate debunkers\". In his 2013 review of the book, Alan Kaufman wrote: \"It is the single most important volume of poetry to appear in the last ten years...he is the poet that America has been waiting for to free our national verse from its stratospheric sense of self-importance and return us to a poetry of flesh and heart, song and cement, just as Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass\" did in the nineteenth Century\". The poems were written over 20 years and described by Kaufman as, \"ash can sonatas to lovemaking with wife, eating out in restaurants, illness, cancelled hopes, money worries, cash scores, tenant complaints, landlord humiliations and ruminations on drug addiction\". In one poem written while his wife was away in Japan, and he was relocating his writing space, he begins:\nIn 2018, Dalachinsky released his poetry collection \"Where Day and Night Become One: The French Poems: 1983-2017\", , which assembled more than 30 years of writing journals from this trips to Paris. It was published by the New York-based publishing company Great Weather for Media, and was the Silver Award-Winner in the 31st Annual IBPA Benjamin Franklin Awards in Poetry. In his review of the book in Sensitive Skin, Valery Oisteanu wrote: \"The free-wheeling Dalachinsky jumps easily from free verse to concrete poetry, from chaotic typography to whimsical designs, word constructions and deconstructions, puns, sound percussion ('tachada, tachada'), plays on names and words à la Duchamp or 'mailtrate de la langue a la Americane'\". The poems were written over 34 years and described by Oisteanu as, \"a dream-like literary mindscape peppered with head-spinning references, using an erudite knowledge, ostentatious name-dropping and a post-beatnik morphistic narrative of rare synchronicity. A perfect collage of cut-ups; train-of-thought à la Allen Ginsberg; an awkwardly unsettling geography laced with hidden meaning\". Addressing a loved one, Dalachinsky writes:\n\nDalachinsky read throughout the New York City area including at the: Poetry Project, Vision Festival, ISSUE Project Room and the Knitting Factory. and also read in San Francisco. Abroad, he had read his works in Japan, Germany and England, where he read his \"Insomnia Poems\", a collaboration with composer Pete Wyer for BBC Radio 3. In France, Dalachinsky performed extensively. He read in Bordeaux, Sète and in Paris at Les Instants Chavirés and the L'Olympic Café. He read at the Centre international de poésie in Marseille, Maison de la Poésie de Nantes at Pannonica, participated in the Sons d'Hiver Festival and the Val-de Marne International Poetry Festival.\n\nIn 2011, he collaborated with French duet art-rockers The Snobs on \"Massive Liquidity\". In 2015, he worked with Alex Lozupone's group, Eighty Pound Pug on a jazz-metal album; and with German visual artist Sig Bang Schmidt on \"Flying Home\" In 2017, he collaborated with his wife on two projects, \"Frozen Heatwave\" and \"Black Magic\". Dalachinsky penned liner notes for recordings of several musicians: Roscoe Mitchell, Charles Gayle, Anthony Braxton, James Blood Ulmer, Matthew Shipp, Roy Campbell, Assif Tsahar, Derek Bailey and Rashied Ali. Additionally, he collaborated with musicians: William Parker, Susie Ibarra, Matthew Shipp, Roy Campbell, Daniel Carter, Sabir Mateen, Mat Maneri, Federico Ughi, Loren Mazzacane Connors, Rob Brown, Tim Barnes and Jim Rourke.\n\nOther books and chapbooks he wrote include: \"Quicksand\", \"The Invisible Ray\" with artwork by Shalom Neuman, \"Lautreamont's Laments\", \"Dream Book\", \"In Glorious Black and White\", \"St. Lucie\", \"Are We Not MEN & Fake Book\", \"Trial and Error in Paris\" and \"Where Night and Day Become One\", from his trips to Paris. His spoken word albums include \"Incomplete Directions\", \"Phenomena of Interference\" with Matthew Shipp and \"I thought it was the end of the world then the end of the world happened again\" with Federico Ughi.\n\nIn 2015, he released a heavy metal album, \"Leave The Door Open\". Culture Catch stated \"Dalachinsky's self-deprecating Brooklyn humor and existentialist beat musings, more usually accompanied by free jazz, prove highly compatible with this doomier sound keyed on Lozupone's electronically combined bass and guitar. Really, what better to accompany a 9/11 poem that starts, 'I thought it was the end of the world/And then the end of the world happened again'?\"\n\nHis poems are included in the anthologies:\nHis works have appeared in the journals:\nDalachinsky died of a stroke on September 16, 2019 at a hospital in Long Island, New York at the age of 72, thirteen days before his 73rd birthday.\n\nAvant-garde jazz has been a major inspiration for his writing, with five books of his poems dedicated solely to jazz musicians.

From 1899 to 1901, he explored and later described in a book the upper reaches of the Yellow River, Yangtze, and Mekong rivers, for which he received the Constantine Medal in 1902.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, when the Great Game reached its peak, Kozlov rivaled Sven Hedin and Aurel Stein as the foremost researcher of Xinjiang. Although he was on good terms with Hedin and other foreign explorers, the British government, as represented by George Macartney, monitored his movements across Central Asia. Kozlov's 1905 visit to the Dalai Lama in Urga gave \"the British War Office a fright\", especially after the Lama declared his intention to \"settle within the confines of Russia\".\n\nDuring his expedition of 1907–1909, Kozlov explored the Gobi Desert and discovered the ruins of Khara-Khoto, a Tangut city destroyed by the Ming Chinese in 1372. It took him several years to excavate the site and bring to St. Petersburg no less than 2,000 books in the Tangut language he uncovered there. Kozlov described his findings in a large volume entitled \"Mongolia and Amdo and the Dead City of Khara-Khoto\" (1923). He was awarded the 1911 Royal Geographical Society's Founder's Gold Medal for his explorations.\n\nHis last expedition to Mongolia and Tibet (1923–1926) resulted in the discovery of an unprecedented number of Xiongnu royal burials at Noin-Ula. After bringing to Petrograd some amazing samples of 2000-year-old Bactrian textiles, Kozlov retired from scientific work and settled in a village near Novgorod.\n\nKozlov married Elizabeth Kozlova, a woman 29 years his junior, who accompanied him on his final journey of exploration as the expedition ornithologist, and who was to publish many monographs and scientific papers on the avifauna of Central Asia.\n\n"}

{"id": "2084364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084364", "title": "City of Prospect", "text": "City of Prospect\n\nThe City of Prospect is an inner urban local government area (LGA) in Adelaide, South Australia. The council seat is the unusually-large suburb of Prospect, which makes up almost two thirds of the tiny council area which is less than 8km2. Established in 1872, it is one of the oldest local government bodies in South Australia.\n\nProspect's population is growing and reflective of a broader demographic. Prospect has a relatively young resident population (average age 36yo), many of whom are ‘knowledge workers’, with high education, skills, intellectual capacity and disposable incomes.\n\nThe community has embraced the significant change effected in recent years. The City of Prospect has had a clear intent over recent years to encourage new, mixed use, larger scale, high quality sustainable development along the arterial roads. This intent has been reflected in council's integrated strategic planning, master plans, public realm and infrastructure upgrades and changes to council's Development Plan. This has created many commercial and business opportunities along the main roads, more housing options to accommodate a growing and diverse residential population and greater capacity for jobs and positive impact on the local economy.\n\nThe current council is:\n\nPrior to European settlement in 1838, the Prospect area was a tiny part of the traditional lands of the Kaurna people, who lived in small bands across the Adelaide Plains.\n\nTo the new settlers, the locality presented a \"beautiful prospect\", being described as \"well timbered, with waving gum and shady trees\". Thus Prospect Village was named by Colonel William Light shortly after the colonisation of South Australia in 1838. George Fife Angas was given the right to make first choice of \"country section\", to which he and other early investors in South Australia were entitled by their purchase of land orders prior to settlement (see \"Lands administrative divisions of South Australia § Land division history\"). Under Light's plan for the city and adjoining rural areas, the present-day inner metropolitan area was laid out as hundreds which were further divided into sections, of about in size. Prospect was to fall within the Hundred of Yatala when it was proclaimed in 1846, but prior to this the section were simply referred to as \"country section\" and the number.\n\nAt a meeting in March 1838, Angas made his choice, selecting the triangular section 474, now the Collinswood but earlier split between Collinswood and the historic suburb of Rosebery. Later in 1838 further selections were made and six sections (four in the southernmost parts of present-day City of Prospect) were purchased by the Mechanics Land Company, including section 349 in which the village of Prospect arose. The company divided the 80-acre sections into blocks, and sold them for £10 a block.\n\nSection 348 immediately south of Prospect Village was known as Little Adelaide.\n\nAs early as November 1838, plots of land \"fronting the new road to the harbour\" had been created from subdivisions in the new village of Prospect and were being publicly advertised for sale. These subdivided sections came to be known as Prospect Village. Early attempts to garden in the vicinity of Prospect failed as the soil is naturally dry, the nearest source of water then being the River Torrens. For many years blocks of land in the area remained unfenced and, in springtime, livestock from nearby areas were not prevented from feeding on the thick grass growing on the hills of Prospect.\n\nIn 1853 the District Council of Yatala was established and included, at its extreme south centre, the future area of the City of Prospect. In 1868 Yatala DC was divided at Dry Creek into the District Councils of Yatala South and Yatala North. In August 1872 the new District Council of Prospect split from the Yatala South DC following lobbying by residents of Prospect village.\n\nIn the 1880s there was a land boom in Prospect. Many new subdivisions were made and new houses built. The 1890s saw a collapse of land values and vacant houses were available to rent for just a few shillings per week.\n\nIn December 1933, the district council was given municipal status as the Corporation of the Town of Prospect. As such it retained the five pre-existing wards of Nailsworth, Kingston, Fitzroy, St. John's Wood and Highbury, each represented by two councillors. The councillors named in the June 1933 proclamation were: Elder George Whittle as mayor, Leonard Andrew Day for Nailsworth, William Henry Verco for Kingston, Richard Angwin for St. John's Wood, and William Thomas Smith for Highbury, with an instruction that the remaining six vacancies be filled by elections later in that year.\n\nIn 1934 a competition to design a coat of arms for the Town of Prospect was held and a design by Mr. Allan F. Sierp was chosen. It contained the following emblems:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2084367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084367", "title": "Epic film", "text": "Epic film\n\nEpic films are a style of filmmaking with large scale, sweeping scope, and spectacle. The usage of the term has shifted over time, sometimes designating a film genre and at other times simply synonymous with big-budget filmmaking. Like epics in the classical literary sense it is often focused on a heroic character. An epic's ambitious nature helps to set it apart from other types of film such as the period piece or adventure film.\n\nEpic historical films would usually take a historical or a mythical event and add an extravagant setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by an expansive musical score with an ensemble cast, which would make them among the most expensive of films to produce. The most common subjects of epic films are royalty, and important figures from various periods in world history.\n\nThe term \"epic\" originally came from the poetic genre exemplified by such works as the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" and the works of the Trojan War Cycle. In classical literature, epics are considered works focused on deeds or journeys of heroes upon which the fate of many people depend. Similarly, films described as \"epic\" typically take a historical character, or a mythic heroic figure. Common subjects of epics are royalty, gladiators, great military leaders, or leading personalities from various periods in world history. However, there are some films described as \"epic\" almost solely on the basis of their enormous scope and the sweeping panorama of their settings such as \"How the West Was Won\" or \"East of Eden\" that do not have the typical substance of classical epics but are directed in an epic style.\n\nWhen described as \"epic\" because of content, an epic movie is often set during a time of war or other societal crisis, while usually covering a longer span of time sometimes throughout entire generations coming and passing away, in terms of both the events depicted and the running time of the film. Such films usually have a historical setting, although fantasy or science fiction settings have become common in recent decades. The central conflict of the film is usually seen as having far-reaching effects, often changing the course of history. The main characters' actions are often central to the resolution of the societal conflict.\n\nIn its classification of films by genre, the American Film Institute limits the genre to historical films such as \"Ben-Hur\". However, film scholars such as Constantine Santas are willing to extend the label to science-fiction films such as \"\" and \"Star Wars\". Lynn Ramey suggests that \"Surely one of the hardest film genres to define is that of the \"epic\" film, encompassing such examples as \"Ben-Hur\", \"Gone with the Wind\"...and more recently, \"300\" and the \"Star Wars\" films...none of these comes from literary epics \"per se\", and there is little that links them with one another. Among those who espouse film genre studies, epic is one of the most despised and ignored genres\". Finally, although the \"American Movie Channel\" formally defines epic films as historical films, they nonetheless state the epic film may be combined with the genre of science-fiction and cite \"Star Wars\" as an example.\n\nStylistically, films classed as epic usually employ spectacular settings and specially designed costumes, often accompanied by a sweeping musical score, and an ensemble cast of bankable stars. Epics are usually among the most expensive of films to produce. They often use on-location filming, authentic period costumes, and action scenes on a massive scale. Biographical films may be less lavish versions of this genre.\n\nMany writers may refer to any film that is \"long\" (over two hours) as an epic, making the definition epic a matter of dispute, and raise questions as to whether it is a \"genre\" at all. As Roger Ebert put it, in his \"Great Movies\" article on \"Lawrence of Arabia\":\n\nThe comedy film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" had the joking tagline \"Makes \"Ben-Hur\" look like an epic.\"\n\nThe epic is among the oldest of film genres, with one early notable example being Giovanni Pastrone's \"Cabiria\", a three-hour silent film about the Punic Wars, which laid the groundwork for the subsequent silent epics of D. W. Griffith.\n\nThe genre reached a peak of popularity in the early 1960s, when Hollywood frequently collaborated with foreign film studios (such as Rome's Cinecittà) to use relatively exotic locations in Spain, Morocco, and elsewhere for the production of epic films such as \"El Cid\" (1961) or \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962). This boom period of international co-productions is generally considered to have ended with \"Cleopatra\" (1963), \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1964), and \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965). Nevertheless, films in this genre continued to appear, with one notable example being \"War and Peace\", which was released in the former Soviet Union during 1967–1968 and, directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\nEpic films continue to be produced, although since the development of CGI they typically use computer effects instead of an actual cast of thousands. Since the 1950s, such films have regularly been shot with a wide aspect ratio for a more immersive and panoramic theatrical experience.\n\nEpic films were recognized in a montage at the 2006 Academy Awards.\n\nThe enduring popularity of the epic is often accredited to their ability to appeal to a wide audience. Many of the highest-grossing films of all-time have been epics. The 1997 film \"Titanic\", which is cited as helping to revive the genre, grossed $658 million domestically and over $2.1 billion worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film of all-time behind the 2019 film \"\" and the 2009 film \"Avatar\", another epic which grossed $2.7 billion worldwide. If inflation is taken into account, then the historical epic \"Gone with the Wind\" becomes the highest-grossing film ever in the United States. Adjusted for inflation it earned the equivalent of $1.6 billion in the United States alone. Adjusted for ticket price inflation, the science fiction/fantasy epic \"Star Wars\" stands at number 2, with an inflated gross of $1.4 billion in the United States.\n\nSo far the most Academy Awards ever won by a single film stands at 11. This feat has only been achieved by three films: \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), \"Titanic\" (1997) and \"\" (2003), all of which are above 3 hours long and considered epic films. The previous record holder was \"Gone With The Wind\" (1939), also an epic, with 10 awards.\n\n\n"}

The Gordon offers 350+ courses across several campuses located in Geelong City, East Geelong, Werribee and Hoppers Crossing. Sixty percent (60%) of The Gordon students live in the wider Geelong region.\n\nThe Gordon Institute of TAFE was opened in 1888 as the Gordon Memorial Technical College.\n\nThe college had its beginnings in 1885, when 500 people met at the Geelong Town Hall to decide upon a memorial to General Charles George Gordon, who died at Khartoum in January 1885. William Humble (owner of the Vulcan Foundry) and George link (Matthew Flinders school headmaster) decided that a school of art be erected in his honour.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid in July 1887 for the first building, Davidson Hall. The land selected for the school was originally part of Johnstone Park, Geelong. January 16, 1888 saw the first term at the Gordon Memorial Technical College commence. There were 63 students enrolled, in subjects ranging from mechanical drawing, to architecture, and languages.\n\nIn 1890 the two storey trade engineering and chemistry buildings opened on Fenwick Street. April 1891 saw the three storey administration building open next door. Behind this building a time capsule was laid. Opened in 1987, the capsule contained copies of Geelong and Melbourne newspapers of the time, as well as reports from the city council. The northern Fenwick Street building was added in 1916, and the Hitchcock art studio in 1910.\n\nIn November 1921 the college changed its name to the Gordon Institute of Technology.

{"id": "2084436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084436", "title": "Elephants Can Remember", "text": "Elephants Can Remember\n\nElephants Can Remember is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in 1972. It features her Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and the recurring character Ariadne Oliver. This was the last novel to feature either character, although it was succeeded by \"Curtain: Poirot's Last Case\", which had been written in the early 1940s but was published last. \"Elephants Can Remember\" concentrates on memory and oral testimony.\n\nAt a literary luncheon Ariadne Oliver is approached by a woman named Mrs Burton-Cox, whose son Desmond is engaged to Oliver's goddaughter Celia Ravenscroft. Mrs Burton-Cox questions the truth regarding the deaths of Celia's parents. Fourteen years before Oliver's close school friend Margaret Ravenscroft and her husband, General Alistair Ravenscroft, were found dead near their manor house in Overcliffe. Both had been shot with a revolver found between their bodies, which bore only their fingerprints. The investigation into their deaths found it impossible to determine if it was a double suicide, or if one of them murdered the other and then committed suicide. Their deaths left Celia and another child orphaned. After consulting Celia Mrs Oliver invites her friend Hercule Poirot to resolve the issue.\n\nPoirot and Mrs Oliver proceed to meet elderly witnesses associated with the case, whom they dub \"elephants\", and discover that Margaret Ravenscroft owned four wigs; that the Ravenscrofts' dog was devoted to the family, but bit Margaret a few days before her death; that Margaret had an identical twin sister, Dorothea, who had spent time in a number of psychiatric nursing homes, and was believed to have been involved in two violent incidents in Asia, including the drowning of her infant son after the death of her husband; and that a month before the couple died Dorothea had been sleepwalking and had died after falling off a cliff. Later Poirot learns the names of governesses who served the Ravenscroft family, one of whom, Zélie Meauhourat, travelled to Lausanne after the couple's deaths.\n\nPoirot soon turns his attention to the Burton-Cox family, and learns that Desmond was adopted and knows nothing about his birth mother. Through his agent, Mr Goby, Poirot learns that Desmond is the illegitimate son of a deceased actress, Kathleen Fenn, who once had an affair with Mrs Burton-Cox's husband and who bequeathed a considerable fortune to Desmond, to be held in trust until he was of age or had married, and which would go to his adoptive mother if he died. Poirot suspects that Mrs Burton-Cox wants to prevent the marriage of Desmond and Celia in order to obtain the use of the money, but he finds no suggestion that Mrs Burton-Cox wishes to kill her son. Eventually he begins to suspect the truth about the Ravenscrofts' death and asks Zélie to return to England to help him to explain it to Desmond and Celia.\n\nPoirot reveals that the woman who died with Alistair was not his wife but her twin, Dorothea. A month before the deaths she had fatally injured Margaret and Margaret had made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest. Alistair had Zélie help him to conceal the truth of his wife's death by planting her body at the foot of a cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died, then having Dorothea take the place of his wife. While she fooled the Ravenscrofts' servants, the family dog could not be deceived and thus bit her. A month after his wife's death Alistair murdered Dorothea to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making certain that she held the revolver before she was killed, and then he committed suicide. Knowing the facts, Desmond and Celia can face the future together.\n\n\nThe \"Elephants\"\n\nMaurice Richardson in \"The Observer\" of 5 November 1972 called the novel \"A quiet but consistently interesting whodunnit with ingenious monozygotic solution. Any young elephant would be proud to have written it.\"\n\nOther critics were less kind. Robert Barnard called the novel \"Another murder-in-the-past case, with nobody able to remember anything clearly, including, alas, the author. At one time we are told that General Ravenscroft and his wife (the dead pair) were respectively sixty and thirty-five; later we are told he had fallen in love with his wife's twin sister 'as a young man'. The murder/suicide is once said to have taken place ten to twelve years before, elsewhere fifteen or twenty. Acres of meandering conversations, hundreds of speeches beginning with 'Well, …' That sort of thing may happen in life, but one doesn't want to read it.\" According to \"The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English\", this novel is one of the \"execrable last novels\" in which Christie \"loses her grip altogether\".\n\n\"Elephants Can Remember\" was cited in a study done in 2009 using computer science to compare Christie's earlier works to her later ones. The sharp drops in size of vocabulary and the increases in repeated phrases and indefinite nouns suggested that Christie may have been suffering from some form of late-onset dementia, perhaps Alzheimer's disease. This could have also been done purposefully, to reflect the fickle nature of memory.\n\n\nThe novel was adapted into a TV film with David Suchet as Poirot, as an episode in the final series of \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\". It was broadcast on ITV on 9 June 2013, and later on the Acorn TV website on 11 August 2014, over a year later. Zoë Wanamaker returned to the role of Ariadne Oliver, marking her fifth out of six appearances on the show in total. Greta Scacchi (Mrs Burton-Cox), Vanessa Kirby (Celia Ravenscroft), Iain Glen (Dr Willoughby) and Ferdinand Kingsley (Desmond Burton-Cox) were also among the cast.\n\nThe adaptation is generally faithful to the novel, but includes some significant additions to the plot. Most notably, there is a gruesome present day murder for Poirot to solve, which raises the tension and allows for a suspenseful ending. The plot of the novel, involving delving into the past, is reduced to background information leading to the present-day murder. Characters such as Mr Goby, Miss Lemon, George, Marlene Buckle (whose mother becomes Mrs Matcham's housekeeper) and ex-Chief Superintendent Spence were removed from the story (Spence's character is replaced with an original character named Beale), whilst the characters of Zélie Meauhourat and Mme Rouselle were combined. \n\nInstead of immediately helping Mrs Oliver with the Ravenscroft case, Poirot instead chooses to investigate the murder of Dr Willoughby's father, which is a subplot that is not in the novel; as a consequence, Dr Willoughby's character is greatly expanded. When Poirot realises that Dr Willoughby and his institute have a connection to the Ravenscrofts, Poirot decides to solve both mysteries. This subplot also includes an original character named Marie McDermott, an Irish-American girl who works as Dr Willoughby's filing clerk and turns out to be his mistress. The character is ultimately revealed to be Dorothea Jarrow's daughter, who is avenging her mother for the cruel treatments she experienced at the hands of Professor Willoughby (an entirely fictional version of hydrotherapy), and also for her mother's murder (as she was at Overcliffe on the day of the tragedy and overheard General Ravenscroft make his plans) by trying to kill both Celia and Desmond. Zélie spirited her away to Canada after the tragedy, and she had to wait thirteen years before she could earn enough money to travel to England and exact her revenge. Also, in keeping with the other episodes, the story is moved from the early 1970s to the late 1930s. This leads to an anachronism when there are references to chemotherapy as a cure for cancer.\n\n\"Elephants Can Remember\" was adapted for radio by BBC Radio 4 in 2006, featuring John Moffatt as Poirot and Julia Mackenzie as Ariadne Oliver.\n\nThe 2007 Thai movie \"Alone\" is loosely inspired by \"Elephants Can Remember.\"\n\n\nThe novel was serialised in the \"Star Weekly Novel\", a Toronto newspaper supplement, in two abridged instalments from 10 to 17 February 1973 with each issue containing the same cover illustration by Laszlo Gal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2084440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084440", "title": "Ziyadid dynasty", "text": "Ziyadid dynasty\n\nThe Ziyadid dynasty () was a Muslim dynasty that ruled western Yemen from 819 until 1018 from the capital city of Zabid. It was the first dynastic regime to wield power over the Yemeni lowland after the introduction of Islam in about 630.\n\nMuhammad ibn Ziyad was a descendant of Yazid, younger brother of the first Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I. In 814 he was arrested and brought to the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun on account of his ancestry, but his life was spared in the end. He was merely placed under surveillance and became the protégé of the caliph's minister al-Fadl ibn Sahl. Three years later a letter from the governor of Yemen arrived to Baghdad, complaining about attacks by the Ash'arite and Akkite tribes. Al-Fadl recommended that al-Ma'mun send the capable Muhammad ibn Ziyad to Tihamah in order to suppress the tribes. The situation was particularly critical since the Alids under a leader called Ibrahim al-Jazzar threatened to detach Yemen from Abbasid control at this time. Muhammad ibn Ziyad was a sworn enemy of the Alids, which made him a suitable choice for the task. After performing the \"hajj\", Muhammad marched south to Yemen with an army of Khurasani soldiers and arrived there in 818. He fought numerous battles against the tribes and won control over the Tihama lowland in the next year.\n\nFollowing his victories, Muhammad was appointed amir of Yemen by al-Ma'mun with the task to restrain 'Alid Shi'a influence. Muhammad established a new city, Zabid, as his capital. It was built in a circular shape and situated midway between the sea and the mountains. He was able to expand his influence into Hadramawt and parts of highland Yemen, all the while recognizing Abbasid overlordship. The historian Umara enumerates his possessions as including Hadramawt, Diyar Kindah, Shihr, Mirbat in Oman, Abyan, Lahij, Aden and the maritime provinces as far north as Hali, as well as Janad, Mikhlaf al-Ma'afir, Mikhlaf Ja'far, San'a, Sa'dah, Najran, and Bayhan in the highlands. However, the sources are somewhat obscure since the historian al-Hamdani asserts that another family, Banu Shurah, exercised paramount power in the Tihama for parts of the ninth century and were established in Zabid. From other sources it appears that San'a in fact continued to be governed by an Abbasid governor up to 847.\n\nLittle is known about the economic structure of the Ziyadid realm, but the historian Umara writes that the dynasty was bolstered by the flourishing international trade. The ruler received duties from ships coming from India. From the east came luxury products such as musk, camphor, ambergris, sandalwood and porcelain. From Africa came Ethiopian and Nubian slaves via the Dahlak Archipelago. Umara also mentions taxes on ambergris collection at Bab al-Mandab and the south coast, and on pearl fishing.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbasid rule in Arabia was declining. After the violent end of caliph al-Musta'in in 866, the second Ziyadid ruler, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, kept the tax revenues for himself and adopted royal trappings. He nevertheless continued reciting the \"khutba\" in the name of the Abbasids. As the Ziyadids' power tended to be concentrated on the lowland, and the Abbasid governors in the highland lacked support from their home base in Iraq, other dynasties were established. The Yufirids established an independent state in San'a in 847 and forced the Ziyadid ruler to tolerate their rule in exchange for mentioning him on coins and in the Friday prayer. An imam of the Shi'ite Zaydiyyah sect, al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya established a power base in the northern highlands in 897; it was the beginning of the Yemeni imamate that endured until 1962. Furthermore, the late ninth and early tenth centuries saw a great deal of agitation by Ismaili figures who adhered to the Fatimid imam (whose descendants were later to become caliphs in Egypt). Zabid itself was sacked by the sectarian Qarmatians, an Ismaili branch, in 904. Under the lengthy reign of Abu'l-Jaysh Ishaq (r. 904-981), the Ziyadid dynasty experienced a temporary revival. However, when Abu'l-Jaysh grew old the outer regions began to fall away from Ziyadid rule. Towards the end of his reign the area between Aden and ash-Sharjah remained under his control. Even as late as 976, the royal revenues amounted to a million gold dinars.\n\nThe Yufirids again attacked in 989 and burnt Zabid. However, the Mamluk al-Husayn bin Salamah managed to save the kingdom from complete collapse. He defeated the mountain tribes and restored the Ziyadid realm to its old limits. Al-Husayn was remembered as a just and high-spirited regent who dug wells and canals and constructed roads across the kingdom. He governed until his peaceful demise in 1012. The back side of the coin was that the Ziyadid monarchs lost effective power after 981 while a succession of Mamluks held real power, which at length made for political turmoil. After al-Husayn's death, his slave, the eunuch Marjan, held power as wazir. He in turn raised two Ethiopian slaves called Nafis and Najah who received high offices in the state. According to Kamal Suleiman Salibi, the last Ziyadi ruler was murdered in 1018 and replaced by Nafis. Nafis adopted royal titles but was immediately challenged by Najah, who defeated Nafis and Marjan and founded the Najahid dynasty in 1022.\n\n\n\n"}

On September 21, 2001, she was arrested and subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit espionage for the government of Cuba. Montes eventually pleaded guilty to spying and in October 2002, was sentenced to a 25-year prison term followed by five years' probation.\n\nMontes was born in West Germany, where her father, Alberto Montes, was posted as a United States Army doctor. Her family was of Asturian origins (a region in Spain), and her grandparents had emigrated to Puerto Rico. The family later lived in Topeka, Kansas, and then Towson, Maryland, where she graduated from Loch Raven High School in 1975. In 1979 she earned a degree in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia, and in 1988 she finished a master's degree at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nMontes' brother and sister, Tito and Lucy, became Federal Bureau of Investigation officers and her former boyfriend, Roger Corneretto, was an intelligence officer specializing in Cuba for the Pentagon.\n\nMontes joined the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in September 1985 after working for the United States Department of Justice. Her first assignment was at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington where she worked as an intelligence research specialist. In 1992, Montes was selected for the DIA's Exceptional Analyst Program and later traveled to Cuba to study the Cuban military.\n\nPrior to her arrest, she lived in a two bedroom co-op in Cleveland Park, Washington, DC.\n\nMontes advanced rapidly through the ranks at the DIA and became its most senior Cuban analyst. Her co-workers regarded her as responsible and dependable, and noted her \"no-nonsense\" attitude. Prosecutors would later allege that Montes was already working for the Cubans when she joined the DIA in 1985.\n\nMontes had been recruited by Cuban Intelligence while she was a university student at Johns Hopkins University in the 1980's.She became known to other students for her strong opinions in support of left wing Latin American movements like the Sandinista National Liberation Front in Nicaragua. A Cuban agent eventually approached her. After recruiting her, the Cuban Intelligence Service groomed her to pursue employment with the Defence Intelligence Agency.\n\nIn their charging documents, federal prosecutors stated:\n\nThe prosecutors further stated that all of the information was on water-soluble paper that could be rapidly destroyed.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation against her, it was determined that Montes had passed a considerable amount of classified information to the Cuban Intelligence Directorate, including the identities of four US spies in Cuba. In 2007, American DIA counterintelligence official Scott W. Carmichael publicly alleged that it was Ana Montes who told Cuban intelligence officers about a clandestine US Army camp in El Salvador. Carmichael alleged that Montes knew about the existence of the Special Forces camp because she visited it only a few weeks before the camp was attacked in 1987 by Cuban-supported guerrillas of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN).\n\nCarmichael, who had led the DIA investigation of Montes, named her as being directly responsible for the death of Green Beret Sergeant Gregory A. Fronius who was killed at El Paraíso, El Salvador, on March 31, 1987, during the FMLN attack. Carmichael characterized the damage Montes caused to the DIA and other US intelligence agencies as \"exceptionally grave,\" and stated that she compromised a \"special access program\" that was kept even from him, the lead investigator on her case.\n\nIn a May 6, 2002, interview with CBS News, former Undersecretary of State John Bolton stated that an official 1998 US government report with significant contributions by Montes concluded that Cuba did not represent a significant military threat to the United States or the region. Bolton alleged that it was not possible to exclude the possibility that the administration of President Bill Clinton may have overlooked Cuba as a potential threat because of Montes' influence and the way she shaped reporting at the DIA.\n\nCarmichael further alleged that, unlike many in the US intelligence community, he believed that Montes' penetration of the DIA was not the exception, but the rule, and that the Cuban intelligence services had multiple spies and moles within US intelligence agencies.\n\nIn 2004 a federal indictment alleged that Montes had assistance from another Cuban agent, Marta Rita Velazquez, once a legal officer at the United States Agency for International Development, who was further alleged to have recruited Montes into espionage. The federal indictment was unsealed in April 2013. Velazquez has been outside the US since 2002, apparently in Sweden, which does not have an extradition treaty with the US for spy cases.\n\nMontes was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation at her office on September 21, 2001, soon after the September 11th attacks. Prosecutors stated that Montes had been privy to classified information about the US military's impending invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, and that they did not want her revealing this information to potential enemies.\n\nIn 2002, Montes pleaded guilty to the charge which could have carried the death penalty, but was sentenced to 25 years in prison in October of the same year after accepting a plea agreement with the US government. According to her lawyer, Plato Cacheris, Montes committed the espionage for moral reasons, as \"she felt the Cubans were treated unfairly by the U.S. government.\"\n\nAs of December 2019, Montes is incarcerated at FMC Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas. FMC Carswell is listed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons as a facility located in the northeast corner of the Naval Air Station, Joint Reserve Base, Fort Worth, which provides specialized medical and mental health services to female offenders.\n\nMontes is listed as FMC Register #25037-016. Her tentative release date is listed as January 8, 2023.\n\n\n\n"}

The act of so moving is termed pioneering. Baháʼís refrain from using the term \"missionary\". The first pioneer to enter a country or region mentioned in ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan is given the title of Knight of Baháʼu'lláh.\n\nDuring the Ten Year Crusade which ran from 1953 to 1963, hundreds of pioneers settled in countries and territories throughout the world, which eventually led to the establishment of 44 new National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies and the increase in the Baháʼí population.\n\nThe teaching work done by pioneers was done in many different ways including, but not limited to\nShoghi Effendi, the head of the Baháʼí Faith in the first half of the 20th century, has written:\n\nFor Baháʼís, pioneering refers to something similar to missionary work. However, Baháʼís do not consider pioneering to be proselytism, a word which often implies the use of coercion to convert someone to a different religion.\n\nThe following is a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual:\n\nDuring Baháʼu'lláh's lifetime (died 1892) he encouraged some of his followers to move to India. When the religion began to grow in India, other Baháʼís moved on - for example entering Vietnam and other places in 1950s. During the 1950s and 1960s the Baháʼí Faith spread rapidly in Vietnam, and the nearby countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. From 1957 to 1963 the Baháʼí community in Vietnam had more than tripled.\n\nThe \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\" to the followers of the religion in the North America, especially to the United States, in 1916-1917 by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, head of the religion until 1921 when he died, asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". Their publication was delayed in the United States until 1919 — after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. Following their publication the first Baháʼí permanent resident in South America, Leonora Armstrong, arrived in Brazil in 1921. Shoghi Effendi, who was named ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Baháʼí Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:\n\n\"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Baháʼí Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Baháʼu'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.\"\nFollowing the 1 May cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on 19 May calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Baháʼí North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Baháʼís to go to Latin America. In 1937 the \"First Seven Year Plan\" (1937-44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Baháʼís the goal of establishing the Baháʼí Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Baháʼís in Latin American, Baháʼí communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America. The first pioneer to Chile arrived in 1940 when her ship docked at Arica. After arriving in Panama in 1940, the first Guaymí Baháʼí converted in the 1960s. In 1985-6 the \"Camino del Sol\" project included indigenous Guaymí Baháʼís of Panama traveling with the Venezuelan indigenous Carib speaking and Guajira Baháʼís through the Venezuelan states of Bolívar, Amazonas and Zulia sharing their religion.\n\nIn 1946, a great pioneering movement began with sixty per cent of the British Baháʼí community eventually relocating. Internationally this effort would take the Baháʼí Faith to Scotland, Wales, and Ireland and raising the numbers of Local Assemblies in the British Isles. In 1950-1 the Baha'is of the British Isles pioneered to Tanganyika, Uganda, and Kenya. On August 3, 1951 pioneers arrived in Kampala from which pioneers went to French Equatorial Africa, and Cameroon and so on. From 1953 to 1963 some 250 Americans and Persians moved to many locations. Wide-scale growth in the religion was observed following this across Sub-Saharan Africa.\n"}

The lyrics are by Vasily Lebedev-Kumach.\n\nThe circumstances of the composition and first performance of the song were hurried; the lyrics were published on 24 June 1941, and Aleksandrov immediately wrote the music for them, writing the notes out on a blackboard for the singers to copy manually. The first performance was on 26 June at Belorussky Rail Terminal, where according to eyewitnesses it was sung five times in succession.\n\nThere are a number of foreign-language adaptations of this song, among them the German version \"Der Heilige Krieg\" (written by Stephan Hermlin), the Korean 정의의 싸움에 (\"Jeong-ui-ui Ssaum-e\") and the Hungarian version \"Fel, küzdelemre, hős haza\".\n\nIn the 1990s Russian media published the allegation that the lyrics had been plagiarized by Lebedev-Kumach, and that they were indeed written during the First World War by Aleksandr Bode (, 1865–1939).

Ataxites are the most nickel-rich meteorites known; they usually contain over 18% nickel. The high nickel content is the reason that they do not develop a Widmanstätten structure, because in this case kamacite can be exsolved from taenite only at such a low temperature (below about 600°C) where diffusion is already too slow.\n\nMost ataxites belong to the IVB group or are classified as \"Iron, ungrouped\" because they do not fit in any of the groups currently recognized by meteorite classification. Some ataxites belong to the IAB group and fall into the sHL (high-Au, low-Ni subgroup), sLH (low-Au, high-Ni subgroup), sHH (high-Au, high-Ni subgroup) and \"ung\" subgroup (does not fit any subgroup of IAB). Only a couple of ataxites have been classified into the IAB complex and the IIF, IVA, IIAB, IIIAB groups.\n\nThey are a rare class, with none of the about 50 observed iron meteorite falls being an ataxite, however, the largest meteorite ever, the Hoba meteorite (found 1920 in Namibia, weight 60 tons), belongs to this class. A Tibetan Buddhist statue, the \"Iron Man\", was likely carved from an ataxite meteorite. It might even be made from a fragment of the Chinga meteorite.

This was not on the site of the present station, but nearer to the Sea Wall by the footbridge which had been built across the line in 1873.\n\nThe original long platforms were lengthened to for the next summer to allow longer trains to call. From 1 July 1907 the station was provided with offices and staff and was therefore renamed Warren Platform. It received its final name of \"Dawlish Warren\" on 1 October 1911.\n\nWork soon started on a new station. A goods yard was opened on 10 June 1912 on the landward side of the line, and the new station, now nearer to Starcross, was opened to passengers on 23 September 1912. The platforms were now long. The building on the 'Down' platform (nearest the beach) was destroyed by fire on 9 January 1924.\nIn 1935 a camp coach was stationed in the goods yard which could be rented by holiday makers but the facility was withdrawn in 1940. Camp coaches were reintroduced in 1952, and by 1959 there were nine coaches stationed here. After 1964 the public camp coach service was withdrawn but the coaches at Dawlish Warren continued to be managed by the British Rail Staff Association for its members. The old coaches were replaced for the 1982 season by the current vehicles, since when the connection to the goods yard has been removed.\n\nThe Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. Goods traffic was withdrawn on 5 August 1967 and on 3 May 1971 the station became unstaffed. From 1974 to 1984 the buildings on the Up side housed the Dawlish Warren Railway Museum with its model railway. This building too burnt down in 2003, but in 2007 a new residential building was built on the site which is outwardly the same design as the former Dawlish Warren signal box. This had been located at the north end of the 'Down' platform until made redundant on 14 November 1986 by the West of England resignalling; it was demolished in May 1990.\n\nThere are four tracks through the station with platforms on the outer pair which allows fast trains to overtake trains stopped at the station. Trains towards Dawlish use the platform nearest the beach, which is only a few yards away.\n\nThe station has step-free access to both platforms. A narrow and low bridge beneath the line immediately south of the station allows access between the platforms.\n\nBehind the platform used by trains towards Paignton is a golf course and the salt marsh and dunes that make up the Dawlish Warren National Nature Reserve.\n\nDawlish Warren is served by Great Western Railway trains in both directions on an approximately hourly basis during the day. Most trains run between Exmouth and Paignton; on Sundays the service is less frequent and most trains only run between Exeter St Davids and Paignton. The route from Exeter St Davids through Dawlish Warren to Paignton is marketed as the \"Riviera Line\".\n\nA few trains run between Bristol & & points west, otherwise passengers travelling east or north change into main line trains at Exeter St Davids or at Newton Abbot if travelling westwards.

The organization was created by writer Peter David for the comic book series \"X-Factor\" (vol. 3). The agency first appears under the name XXX Investigations in the first issue of the Marvel Comics limited series \"Madrox\" #1 (November 2004). In the final issue, \"Madrox\" #5 (March 2005), the name is changed to X-Factor Investigations, and later abbreviated XF Investigations.\n\nPeter David introduced the agency in the limited series \"Madrox\". The \"Madrox\" series ended in March 2005, but with positive fan and retailer reaction to the book, Marvel relaunched the series under their oft-used title \"X-Factor\", David having considered \"Madrox\" an \"X-Factor\" book anyway. At the 2005 San Diego Comic Con Peter David announced the agency would continue, following events in \"Madrox\" and \"House of M\" and intended the agency to be \"dark and scruffy,\" inspired by the paranormal Fox TV series \"X-Files\". At the 2009 Fan Expo Canada, it was announced that the current X-Factor series would be re-numbered to #200 in December 2009, to take up the numbering of the original series. The series ended after issue #262, after 114 issues.\n\nX-Factor Investigations is a detective agency run by Jamie Madrox, formerly known as the costumed superhero Multiple Man. The agency was originally named \"XXX Investigations\", but team members thought that it sounded too much like Madrox was investigating pornography. The new name is taken from the government-sponsored mutant supergroup that the three founders had previously served on.\n\nThe initial staff consisted of Madrox's best friend and special enforcer, Guido Carosella (Strong Guy) and former teammate Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane). Following the House of M, Madrox's newfound wealth from winning a \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\"-style game show allowed him to recruit several of his former colleagues of the Paris branch of the now defunct X-Corporation. New members include Siryn, a powerless Rictor, M and Layla Miller, who has inserted herself into the group to keep them from discovering the truth behind the mutant Decimation, a catastrophic worldwide wiping out of mutant powers that took place during a storyline of the same name. The agency subsequently conflict with rival agency Singularity Investigations, after they ordered Siryn beaten and left for dead.\n\nIn the aftermath of the \"Decimation\" storyline, Madrox, after meeting with Singularity CEO Damian Tryp, asks Siryn to find out more about the Decimation from the heroes who might have been involved. She learns from Spider-Man that the X-Men (who had denied any involvement), as well as Quicksilver were, in fact, central to the ending of that event.\n\nLittle is known about Damian Tryp apart from that he runs Singularity Investigations, which is in direct competition with Jamie Madrox's X-Factor Investigations and his encounters with Madrox's team. He is also one of the few mutants that kept their superhuman powers after the M-Day event, although it has been revealed that he might not be a mutant, but a genetic throwback to an earlier time, (a \"changeling\"), a predecessor to mutants who develop powers at birth. Tryp's mutation enables him to live for a very long time, as evidenced by him being alive in the 12th-century Wales. He also is able to move through time in a similar fashion to Quicksilver, which enables him to bring together himself at three different times.\n\nDamian Tryp also seems to be involved in Jamie Madrox’s past. When Jamie was born, the doctor’s slap caused him to multiply into two identical babies, which was rather shocking to both his parents and the doctor. Professor Charles Xavier, a friend of the Madrox family, suggested that they move to Kansas to raise the boy in privacy with the possibility of the boy to be later taught at Professor X’s school for the gifted youngsters. However, when Madrox was still young, Tryp also makes an own offer to look after Jamie, claiming that Jamie was also a \"changeling\" like him. Jamie's parents, however, refuse to give Jamie to Tryp, who proceeds to create a freak tornado that kills Jamie's parents.\n\nThe all-out conflict between Tryp's Singularity Investigations and X-Factor Investigations began after the youngest version of Tryp badly beat Siryn (after shooting her in the neck with a dart that prevented her from using her powers) and left her for dead. Siryn, as part of her duties for X-Factor Investigations, was investigating the murder of the woman who died in Jack Vaughn's penthouse under suspicious circumstances. Jack Vaughn (a movie star) claimed that the woman was killed by her sister, Gloria Santiago, who was upset about the relationship (claiming that Jack was \"no good\" for her sister), and that all he was trying to do was wrestle the gun away from her. The sister thus hired X-Factor Investigations to help her clear her name and bring Jack to justice. Singularity Investigations was representing Jack Vaughn with Tryp, Junior (in other words, the youngest version) as the defense counsel. Siryn and X-Factor Investigations managed to incriminate Vaughn and to thwart SI's assassination attempt on Rictor. Tryp, Junior is so infuriated by this that he ambushes Siryn and beat her almost to death, leaving her to die in an alley.\n\nMadrox and Strong Guy give Tryp a very public warning as Tryp is jogging in the park. They tell Tryp that they know that it was he who hurt Siryn, and while they will not hurt him in broad daylight, he should watch his back. Tryp, Junior and Tryp, Senior make Madrox an offer to join their firm, and Madrox laughs in response.\n\nDuring the \"Civil War\" Quicksilver has returned to Mutant Town following the events of Son of M, having gained the ability to restore other mutants' powers from the Terrigen Mists. X-Factor used this to confront the X-Men with their knowledge of the Decimation. As a result, X-Factor has taken a public stance in defiance of the Superhuman Registration Act. However, Rictor and M were registered by a duplicate of Madrox who is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Madrox, Strong Guy, and Wolfsbane are already registered because of their membership in the previous, government-sponsored X-Factor. The X-Men have decided not to interfere with Quicksilver as long as he stays in Mutant Town.\n\nWhen a former Singularity employee came to X-Factor Investigations and related that Tryp is attempting to recreate the Legacy Virus, the plague that killed several mutants, including, briefly, Madrox himself, Strong Guy is sent to drive the man to safety. However, once they are alone, Strong Guy kills him and calls Tryp to report this. It is later revealed that Tryp has placed a hypnotic suggestion in Strong Guy's mind to turn him into a sleeper agent. According to the oldest version of Tryp (ancient), all of Singularity Investigations' efforts to create the Legacy Virus have been to prevent a possible future in which X-Factor manages to undo the Decimation, but as a result, humanity is wiped out by the re-powered mutants in a bloody conflict. As such, X-Factor Investigations' new goal is to undo the Decimation, but also to prevent the conflict Tryp predicted.\n\nDue to one of Madrox's dupes blowing up the SI building, apparently killing Tryp, Junior and Tryp, Senior (i.e., the middle-aged version), only the ancient Tryp (the one who has been alive the longest and has seen the grim future) is still alive.\n\nAfter the destruction of Singularity Investigations, the present form of Damian Tryp (the elder/ancient) reveals to Layla that her very existence had foiled his plans — she is a force of chaos like he is. Tryp also reveals that when he comes into conflict with Layla, terrible events occur as a result. Following her encounter with Tryp, Layla appears genuinely shocked for the first time: the glass of milk she is pouring overflows, spilling onto the floor.\n\nAfter finding out about the foretold event, each member of the X-Factor Investigations attends a session with Doc Samson.\n\nDuring the \"World War Hulk\" storyline, X-Factor comes to the aid of Professor Xavier when the Hulk seeks retribution on him due to his role within the Illuminati.\n\nAfter Madrox's experience with his S.H.I.E.L.D. dupe, a dupe he has forgotten about, Madrox went on a quest to gather his lost dupes and revealed an ability to absorb himself into dupes. This quest met an end when he found a dupe who had built his own family. Meanwhile, Siryn and Monet bonded in France and rescued a child from a riot. X-Factor was then attacked by the X-Cell and almost defeated. The X-Cell's members believed the government to be responsible for their lost powers. All but Marrow and Callisto were repowered by Quicksilver and Rictor—a process that resulted in the death of their leader and Abyss, Fatale and Reaper fleeing into the brimstone dimension to fate unknown. When Layla Miller revealed what truly happened to Callisto and Marrow, Rictor used his powers to expel the Terrigen crystals from Quicksilver's body (except for one, which Quicksilver kept) at the cost of his powers.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Madrox, Rictor, and an accompanying Layla Miller are alerted to the Xavier Mansion by Emma Frost during the mutant baby conflict. Madrox and Layla are sent to Forge's headquarters to send two dupes into different alternate realities. Layla, however, goes with one of the dupes at the last minute, claiming she has a part to play in their mission. Unfortunately, Forge informs Madrox that there is no way to retrieve Layla and his dupes, who received instructions to kill themselves once they received the information they needed to get reabsorbed into Madrox Prime. Layla and the Madrox-dupe land in Bishop's future, and are captured and held in mutant internment camps. Rictor is instructed to go undercover as a Purifer by pretending to shoot Rahne as she attacked the group's members. He has since gained information on their artillery until his cover was blown by Anole and the other New X-Men. Rahne later joins the mutant group X-Force to hunt down Cable using their hyper-keen senses. Siryn was called by the mutant named Peepers asking to help him out. When Siryn arrived on the scene, Peepers was eaten to the bone by Predator-X who was already on his way looking for the next mutant to kill. Strong Guy, Siryn, and M joined forces with the X-Men against the various groups trying to take control of the mutant baby.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Rahne, after a confrontation with Jamie about her leaving, reveals that she has seen herself murder Jamie and Layla Madrox on their wedding night, and not wanting to kill Layla upon her return from the dystopian future, leaves the team and joins X-Force. Meanwhile, Rictor, spots a girl he thinks is Layla, but discovers she is a young prostitute who resembles Layla. After some aggressive words with the young woman's pimp, he gets into a fight that leaves him wounded. After Guido joins in the fight, the men quickly disperse, and he escorts Rictor to a hospital. Elsewhere, Jamie is seen looking for a fight and finds himself at a Purifier gathering. After shooting their leader with a tranquilizer, Jamie makes three copies of himself and readies for a fight. Siryn reveals to a reverend that she is pregnant with Jamie's child, and later at a bar, reveals to Monet that she intends to give birth to the child.\n\nMeanwhile, Mutant Town is under the clutches of Silver Age X-Men villain Arcade with Rictor as his prisoner; Valerie Cooper returns as a supporting character and X-Factor relocates to Detroit, Michigan.\n\nTo address the absence of Layla Miller and Rahne Sinclair, and to add new character dynamics to the team, writer Peter David added new cast members to the book, Longshot and Darwin. David chose Longshot for the character's optimism and upbeat attitude, which David felt would be an appropriate replacement for Rahne and Layla respectively. He chose Darwin because the character was a relatively blank slate, that afforded David the freedom to write him however he wanted, as the character appeared only in the storylines \"\" and \"Rise and Fall of the Shi'Ar Empire\".\n\nDuring the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, Darwin goes in search of Professor Xavier because he wants to help him. He encounters Longshot, who tries to lead him to the Professor by using his powers. Longshot, however is unsure if his powers have been working correctly and tests them out on a group of people which turn on Darwin and attack. After a brief fight, Darwin manages to get away and the crowd turn on Longshot. Darwin's father hires X-Factor to find his son, supposedly because he feels bad for walking out on him and his mother when he was younger. Madrox, Monet and Guido track down Darwin and Longshot but Longshot is attacked by Jazinda and She-Hulk who are trailing after him because he is really a Skrull. After a fight between the two groups, they both realize Longshot is a Skrull, capture and hand him over to Jazinda and She-Hulk and go their separate ways.\n\nAfter Darwin is reunited with his father, only to be betrayed and sold out to by operatives of an organization known as the Karma Project, who are experimenting on living human beings. Meanwhile, the real Longshot shows up and he and Darwin join X-Factor. Valerie Cooper takes an interest in Siryn's unborn child. During a confrontation when Siryn is leaving for the hospital because her water broke, Val is accidentally shot. While Val recovers, Siryn gives birth and finally acknowledges that her father is dead and is never coming back. She names her son Sean after her father, but when Madrox holds him, he absorbs Sean. Jamie Madrox leaves X-Factor Investigations in order to talk to his last remaining dupe, John Maddox. Explaining to John that dupes are unable to have babies, John reveals that he already knew this. However, Jamie threatens to kill himself, knocking out John. Before he pulls the trigger, an older Layla Miller returns to stop him.\n\nJamie is transported to the future in the midst of the Summers Rebellion, where mutants rise up against Sentinel and human oppressors, which is led by Ruby Summers, the daughter of Cyclops and Emma Frost with her fathers' optic blasts and Emma's organic mineral body, Layla, and a cyborg Cyclops, whose predicament is Jamie's fault. After Jamie kisses Layla (now an adult) out of happiness at seeing her, Cyclops wants Jamie to find out why some mutants are winking out of existence. The group visit an aging, senile Doctor Doom, who says Layla told him in the past that he'd have to instruct Jamie and her on something in the future, and it is now.\n\nIn the present, X-Factor and new members Longshot and Darwin are battling Cortex, an agent of the Summers Rebellion era government. Cortex briefly controls Shatterstar and M, using them to respectively make assassination attempts on Reverend John Maddox and an X-Factor client. Cortex grabs Longshot, trying to also control him, and realizes he and Shatterstar are connected, and when Cortex loses control over Monet, she attacks him and his hood falls back revealing that he is the second Jamie Madrox duplicate from \"Messiah Complex\".\n\nThe Madrox dupe is teleported to the future once more, where his technological parts are taken over by an elderly Doom. There he engages in combat with the future X-Men. Although he manages to kill Fitzroy, Ruby begs Layla to bring him back revealing that Layla has the ability to resurrect the dead—however her powers restores them without a soul/conscience. The conflict reaches its peak when a massive Sentinel is about to destroy most of the mutants. Fitzroy absorbs Cortex's life energy and sends the massive sentinel in the past (where the sentinel crashes killing its constructors parents thus completing a chain of events that started all of this). Madrox is teleported back in the past to Detroit where he meets up with the rest of X-Factor.\n\nLayla however, goes further back, where she meets up with her younger past self. After telling her all of this she downloads her knowledge into her past self's mind thus further completing the causality loop and granting her the knowledge she had to begin with.\n\nFollowing the events in \"X-Factor\" #50, Madrox decides to move X-Factor Investigations back to New York City, which he believes is where the team should really be. In their first mission, the team is approached by Valeria and Franklin Richards, who ask for X-Factor's help to locate their mother, The Invisible Woman, who has mysteriously vanished. Upon going to the Baxter Building, X-Factor is stonewalled by Reed Richards, while Strong Guy and Shatterstar battle with Thing, ending in Thing's defeat. Longshot identifies from clues left on the Fantasticar that Sue was kidnapped to Latveria and in a vision sees Layla Miller allied with Doctor Doom. After much debate, the team travel to Latveria to assault Castle Doom and steal back Invisible Woman, where Monet, Shatterstar, and Thing go head-to-head with Doom himself.\n\nElsewhere, Monet returns home only to discover Val Cooper with bad news, her father has been taken hostage by terrorists and will only return him in exchange for Monet herself. Following from the events of the Latveria battle, Monet and Strong Guy travel deep into the unknown jungles in the hope of freeing Monet's father. It is revealed that the man behind the kidnapping is none other than Baron Mordo.\n\nDuring the \"Second Coming\" storyline, Bolivar Trask, after being given the mission to kill all members of the X-Factor team, assigns Absorbing Man and Bastion to the task. However, the team is weakened by the absence of Strong Guy, who is dealing with Baron Mordo and the kidnapped Monet.\n\nLayla and Rahne rejoin the team. While M was knocked out by Layla about her involvement with Doctor Doom in the disappearance of Sue Richards (a.k.a. The Invisible Woman), Rahne goes upstair and interrupts an intimate moment between Rictor and Shatterstar, as well as reveal her pregnancy. Rictor is shocked by Rahne's pregnancy because they slept together before she left to join X-Force, while Rahne is shocked that Rictor and Shatterstar are in a homosexual relationship. Because of her Catholic beliefs, she attacks Shatterstar in her wolf form and pushes him to the ground from the window for \"turning\" Rictor gay, but they are interrupted by Longshot. Rictor asks Rahne if he's the father of her baby, and she deceives him into thinking so by saying she wasn't with anyone else seven months ago. Madrox and Theresa have tracked down Pip the Troll and have taken from him an amulet that protected him from Hela's sight, leading to his capture by her. The team sets out to Las Vegas to rescue him by using Longshot's power to win at casino for four months to gain attention. They got attacked by Hela but were rescued by Thor and successfully rescues Pip with help from Darwin. However, a confrontation with Hrimhari—an Asgardian wolf prince—reveals that he actually is the father of Rahne's baby. Pip joins the team out of gratitude that they saved him but it is implied that he has his own agenda. Rictor is upset with the news but forgives Rahne when he learns that she's just worried about his soul.\n\nWhile in the heat of a battle to rescue J. Jonah Jameson, Strong Guy was shot and killed, but Layla revived him at the cost of his soul. Her action changed the future that was uploaded to her brain by her older self.\n\nAs the birth of Rahne's son is near, various forces of demons attack X-Factor headquarter. Rahne was forced to rely on her old pack to protect and gave birth to her son, Tier, through her mouth. He was left with Rahne's pack for his own survival.\n\nWhen the demon Bloodbath attacked X-Factor, Madrox was seemingly killed. However, he was revealed to be transported to an alternate reality by the corpses of Layla and himself on their wedding night, and confronted Vanora, whom Layla had paid to kill them. Jaime died and found himself in a reality in which humans were dominated by Deathlok. He died once more and found himself the apprentice of Doctor Strange, who had just died at the hands of Dormammu. The spirit of Doc Strange was able to send Jamie back to his reality, but complications drew Vanora, Deathlok and Dormammu with him. In his absence, Havok and Polaris joined and led the team, much to their dismay. Jamie came back from his body in the freezer and agreed to share the leadership with Havok.\n\nDuring the \"Breaking Points\" storyline, the team fights three interdimensional monsters brought on Earth by Damian Tryp. As a now soulless Strong Guy endangers people while fighting these monsters, M lashes out at him. This behaviour and the fact that their relationship did not work leads him to leave the team. He is then intercepted by a threatening silhouette whom he joins. The remaining monster, Vanora, daughter of a parallel universe Rahne, escapes. After that, Darwin finally catches up with Rahne's son and tries to kill him, only to be stopped by Werewolf by Night. A fight ensues between Rahne, Shatterstar, Rictor, Darwin and Vanora. Shatterstar apparently kills Vanora, and Rahne leaves the team to take care of her son, Tier. Later that day, crows are seen pecking at Vanora, though she somehow revives. Polaris learns of her true origins (and the fact that she murdered her parents, whereas she always believed that Magneto did it) thanks to Monet and Longshot. The revelation leaves her in a catatonic state. It is also implied that Banshee is having visions of her dead father. Siryn agrees to her destiny as the avatar of the ancient spirit of Morrigan - the Banshee and absorb it to save Polaris's sanity. She heals Lorna who was left in a catatonic state and leaves the team, confessing to Madrox that, in the end, she always loved him. Madrox confronts Havok on his leadership. Havok decides to leave the team to find his path whereas Lorna wants to stay. Madrox and Layla get married.\n\nWhen trying to take a honeymoon vacation, Jamie and Layla were attack by a legion of zombie while the rest of the team are attacked by a mysterious force. It was later reviewed that they are the Hell Lords who is awaken by Guido's resurrection by Layla and the birth of Rahne's baby son, Tier. Pip was seemingly killed by the Hell Lords in an effort to protect the team, and later possess M's body in order to escape his death. However, it is implied that he quits the team out of safety or Jamie fired him out of anger for his involvement in the event.\n\nThe X-Factor building is destroyed. Rahne, Tier rejoin the team in order to protect themselves and Darwin agrees to help and later rejoins the team Strong Guy killed Tier and became the King of Hell. Rictor and Shatterstar seemingly died.\n\nIt was later reviewed that Rictor and Shatterstar got transferred to a past version of Mojoworld. Shatterstar's origin and relationship to Longshot and Dazzler is reviewed: He was Longshot's genetic source, as well as his son with Dazzler, created a paradox where as Shatterstar is both Longshot's \"father\" / clone AND his son with different DNA.\n\nAfter the events of \"Hell on Earth\", each team members found themselves got blasted into different places without their teammates. Longshot left the team as he felt he has nothing left after the death of Shatterstar. Rahne found herself in Vermont and left the team for the guilt of bringing the war and the death of her son. Polaris found herself in NY without any member of her team, got drunk and attempted a suicide-by-cop and got thrown in jail, where she made a deal with a mysterious figure (later revealed to be Harrison Snow). Monet and Darwin found themselves in Las Vegas and rejoined the Jean Grey mutant school. Layla and Jamie found themselves in Morocco. They encountered Siryn and she restored Jamie from his demon form. Upon returning to where the X-Factor building once stand, Jamie, frustrated over the situation and concluded that the world is for \"other people to save\", sold the team to Harrison Snow - CEO and president of Serval Industry, and retired to his family farm with Layla - his pregnant wife. Snow renamed the team and began to recruit people into the \"All-New X-Factor\".\n\nNotes:\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, X-Factor nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book and eventually won in 2011. Peter David said this in an interview later: \"I’m appreciative of Marvel Comics allowing me so much latitude in X-Factor, particularly Joe Quesada's unequivocal public support when Rictor and Shatterstar first liplocked. I note that the award only names me, and I think that’s shortsighted, because there’s been a host of artists and editors along the way who have done a terrific job to bring the stories to the public. And ultimately I look forward to the day when this award is utterly unnecessary because the positive portrayal of LGBTs is simply so commonplace that it’s no longer newsworthy. It’s just the normal state of things.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2084531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084531", "title": "Baculoviridae", "text": "Baculoviridae\n\nBaculoviridae is a family of viruses. Arthropods, lepidoptera, hymenoptera, diptera, and decapoda serve as natural hosts. There are currently 84 species in this family, divided among four genera.\n\nBaculoviruses are known to infect invertebrates, with over 600 host species having been described. Immature (larval) forms of moth species are the most common hosts, but these viruses have also been found infecting sawflies, mosquitoes, and shrimp. Although baculoviruses are capable of entering mammalian cells in culture \nthey are not known to be capable of replication in mammalian or other vertebrate animal cells.\n\nStarting in the 1940s they were used and studied widely as biopesticides in crop fields. Baculoviruses contain circular double-stranded genome ranging from 80 to 180 kbp.\n\nThe earliest records of baculoviruses can be found in the literature from as early as the sixteenth century in reports of \"wilting disease\" infecting silkworm larvae. Starting in the 1940s the viruses were used and studied widely as biopesticides in crop fields. Since the 1990s they have been employed to produce complex eukaryotic proteins in insect cell cultures (see Sf21, High Five cells). These recombinant proteins have been used in research and as vaccines in both human and veterinary medical treatments (for example, the most widely used vaccine for prevention of H5N1 avian influenza in chickens was produced in a baculovirus expression vector). More recently it has been found that baculoviruses can transduce mammalian cells with a suitable promoter.\n\nThe baculovirus life cycle involves two distinct forms of virus. Occlusion derived virus (ODV) is present in a protein matrix (polyhedrin or granulin) and is responsible for the primary infection of the host while the budded virus (BV) is released from the infected host cells later during the secondary infection.\n\nBaculoviruses have very species-specific tropisms among the invertebrates with over 700 host species having been described. Immature (larval) forms of moth species are the most common hosts, but these viruses have also been found infecting sawflies, mosquitoes, and shrimp.\n\nTypically, the initial infection occurs when a susceptible host insect feeds on plants that are contaminated with the occluded form of the virus. The protein matrix dissolves in the alkaline environment of the host midgut (stomach), releasing ODV that then fuse to the columnar epithelial cell membrane of the host intestine and are taken into the cell in endosomes. Nucleocapsids escape from the endosomes and are transported to nucleus. This step is possibly mediated by actin filaments. Viral transcription and replication occur in the cell nucleus and new BV particles are budded out from the basolateral side to spread the infection systemically. During budding, BV acquires a loosely fitting host cell membrane with expressed and displayed viral glycoproteins.\n\nBaculovirus infection can be divided to three distinct phases: \n\nWhile BV is produced in the late phase, the ODV form is produced in the very late phase acquiring the envelope from host cell nucleus and embedded in the matrix of occlusion body protein. These occlusion bodies are released when cells lyse to further spread baculovirus infection to next host. The extensive lysis of cells frequently causes the host insect to literally disintegrate, thus the reason for the historic name \"wilting disease.\" The complete ODV-polyhedrin particles are resistant to heat and light inactivation, whereas the naked BV virion is more sensitive to environment.\n\nWhen infecting a caterpillar, the advanced stages of infection cause the host to feed without resting, and then to climb to the higher parts of trees, including exposed places they would normally avoid due to the risk of predators. This is an advantage for the virus if (when the host dissolves) it can drip down onto leaves which will be consumed by new hosts.\n\nThe most studied baculovirus is \"Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus\" (AcMNPV). The virus was originally isolated from the alfalfa looper (a lepidopteran) and contains a 134-kbp genome with 154 open reading frames (ORF). The major capsid protein VP39 together with some minor proteins forms the nucleocapsid (21 nm x 260 nm) that encloses the DNA with p6.9 protein.\n\nBV acquires its envelope from the cell membrane and requires a glycoprotein, gp64, to be able to spread systemic infection. This protein forms structures called peplomers on one end of the budded virus particle but is not found on ODV (although several other proteins are only associated with the ODV form). Some differences also exist in the lipid composition of the viral envelope of the two forms. While the BV envelope consists of phosphatidylserine, ODV contains phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine.\n\nA nucleocapsid assembly-essential element (NAE) was identified in the AcMNPV genome. The NAE is an internal \"cis\"-element within the \"ac83\" gene. The nucleocapsid assembly is not dependent on the Ac83 protein product.\n\nDuring periods of evolution, the baculoviral envelope glycoproteins have undergone changes. Ld130, also known as baculovirus F-protein from \"Lymantria dispar\" (LdMNPV) is suggested to be an ancestral envelope fusion protein which has been replaced by non-orthologous gene replacement with gp64 in AcMNPV, \"Bombyx mori\" (BmNPV) and \"Orgyia pseudotsugata\" (OpMNPV) while they still retain the ld130 gene.\n\nGp64 is a homotrimeric membrane glycoprotein which is polarly present on the rod-shaped virion. It consists of 512 amino acids (aa) with four glycosylation sites at asparagine residues and has a N-terminal signal sequence (20 aa), oligomerization and fusion domain and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain near the C-terminus (7 aa).\n\nIt is produced in both early and late phases of the infection cycle with a maximal rate of synthesis occurring in 24–26 h p.i.. Trimerization with intermolecular cysteine-bonds seems to be a crucial step for protein transport to cell surface, since only 33% of synthesized protein reaches cell surface as monomeric gp64 is degraded within the cells.\n\nGp64 is essential for efficient budding of the virion and for the cell-to-cell transmission during the infection cycle as well as viral entry i.e. causing viral trophism and endosome mediated uptake to the cell. The major function of the gp64 envelope protein is to cause the pH-mediated envelope fusion to the endosome. Although gp64 has variety of essential functions, it has been reported that gp64-null baculoviruses can be substituted with other viral glycoproteins such as Ld130, G-protein of \"Vesicular stomatitis\" virus. These substitutions will result in functional virons.\n\nBaculovirus expression in insect cells represents a robust method for producing recombinant glycoproteins or membrane proteins. Baculovirus-produced proteins are currently under study as therapeutic cancer vaccines with several immunologic advantages over proteins derived from mammalian sources.\n\nBaculoviruses are incapable of replicating within the cells of mammals and plants. They have a restricted range of hosts that they can infect that is typically restricted to a limited number of closely related insect species. Because baculoviruses are not harmful to humans, they are considered a safe option for use in research applications. They are also used as biological agents as in the case of the Indian mealmoth, a grain-feeding pest.\n\nThe name of this family has been derived from the latin word baculus, meaning stick. The family has been divided into four genera: Alphabaculovirus (lepidopteran-specific nucleopolyhedroviruses), Betabaculovirus (lepidopteran-specific Granuloviruses), Gammabaculovirus (hymenopteran-specific nucleopolyhedroviruses) and Deltabaculovirus (dipteran-specific nucleopolyhedroviruses).\n\nGroup: dsDNA\nBaculoviruses are thought to have evolved from the \"Nudivirus\" family of viruses .\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2084556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084556", "title": "Indirect grilling", "text": "Indirect grilling\n\nIndirect grilling is a barbecue cooking technique in which the food is placed to the side of or above the heat source instead of directly over the flame as is more common. This can be achieved by igniting only some burners on a gas barbecue or by piling coals to one side of a charcoal pit. A drip tray is placed below the food to prevent fat from the food igniting and generating a direct flame. Indirect grilling is designed to cook larger (e.g. pork shoulders, whole chicken) or tougher foods (e.g. brisket, ribs) that would burn if cooked using a direct flame. This method of cooking generates a more moderate temperature (about 275–350 °F) and allows for an easier introduction of wood smoke for flavoring.\n\nWhile placing the food to one side of the fire places the food further from the heat source and thus reduces the intensity of the radiation, the food is still exposed to direct radiation from the fire. Other variations of indirect grilling place a physical barrier between the food and the fire. One method is to place a plank or an unperforated tray on the grill as a base upon which to cook. If the plank is made from wood and is soaked before grilling, the wood can then be used to impart flavor to the food. Another method of indirect grilling is to place a physical barrier such as a pizza stone between the fire and the food. The heat rises from the fire around the edges of the barrier and then circulates around the food. Most brands of kamado style outdoor cookers have accessories known as heat deflectors which can be placed above the fire and below the food grate.\n\nIn the 1990s it became popular to stand a chicken on an open can of beer or other canned beverage inserted into the cavity when indirect grilling, a preparation known as \"beer can chicken\". Some believe that the contents of the can boil and flavor the food with the consequent vapor, however rigorous tests have invoked skepticism on this point. All modern canned beverages are lined with an epoxy resin to prevent the can's contents from reacting with the aluminum in the can. Heating the epoxy resin imparts wonderful flavor to the chicken.\n\nPlank cooking, also referred to as planking, is the technique of roasting or baking food, usually fish or meat, on wooden planks. Several cultures around the world did this in their pre-modern traditional cuisine. The Finnish dish \"loimulohi\" (\"blazing salmon\") is an example of this, while in North America the Northwest Coast Indians used predominately Western Red Cedar planks to cook Pacific species of salmon.\n\nPlanks can be put directly over open flames, or stood on edge and faced towards the flames (the Finnish method), either method infuses the food with the natural oils and moisture found in the woods adding flavor.\n\nSince the 1990s professional chefs in North America have experimented with expanding the list of foods prepared on planks beyond salmon and wild meats, to also include a variety of meats, poultry, vegetables, cheese, fruits and even pizza. For years, restaurants have kept the tradition alive by serving salmon cooked on planks. But more recently, as pre-cut boards have become widely available, chefs and home cooks across the continent have been experimenting with cooking on planks.\n\nBesides roasting over an open flame, planking can also be used in an oven, for breads and pastries as well as savoury dishes.\n\nPlank cooking has been the subject of parody. \n\nCanadian TV chef Ted Reader is a noted proponent of plank cooking.\n\n\n"}

It is also referred to as an overhead. A smash can usually be hit with a high amount of force and is often a shot that ends the point. Most smashes are hit fairly near the net or in mid-court before the ball bounces, generally against lobs that have not been hit high enough or deep enough by the opponent. A player can also smash a very high ball from the \"baseline\", generally on the bounce, although this is often a less forceful smash.\n\n\"Smash\" commonly refers to the forehand smash; backhand smashes are rarer and more difficult to execute, especially for beginners, since they are basically high backhand volleys generally hit at an exact angle causing the ball to spin. Rod Laver and Jimmy Connors, both left-handers, were known for their very powerful backhand smashes. The forehand smash was first used in Tennis by Helena Rice on championship point in the 1890 Wimbledon Championships final.\n\nIn his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, who had a fine overhead himself, devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He writes: \"OVERHEAD—Schroeder just tops here, ahead of Rosewall and Newcombe.\n\nThe grip used for a tennis smash is usually a continental grip although some players use an Eastern grip. The swing is an upward throwing motion, making the execution of the shot almost identical to a serve. The main difference from a serve is position and footwork. The positioning and footwork are more similar to a volley which is usually hit with a strong forward weight transfer from inside the court. The smash can be executed with one or both feet on the ground.\n\nJimmy Connors invented and popularized the \"skyhook\", a version of the overhead smash in which the Eastern grip used to hit the ball further behind the body than is possible with a traditional overhead smash.\n\nPete Sampras (and before him Yannick Noah) popularized the \"jump smash\", where the player jumps and then hits the smash in mid-air. The shot is often also called a slam dunk, as in basketball.\n\n"}

{"id": "2084583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084583", "title": "Dietrich v The Queen", "text": "Dietrich v The Queen\n\nDietrich v The Queen is an important legal case decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986. It concerned the nature of the right to a fair trial/and under what circumstances indigent defendants (who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay in most circumstances in which an accused is unrepresented. It is an important case in Australian criminal law and in Australian constitutional law since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.\n\nOn 17 December 1986, the accused, the career criminal Olaf Dietrich (born 1952), flew from Bangkok, Thailand, to Melbourne Airport. He had imported at least 70 g of heroin, which he concealed within condoms that he had swallowed. He was arrested the next morning by the Australian Federal Police, who searched his flat and found one of the condoms in the kitchen/and some heroin in a plastic bag under a rug in another room. He was taken into custody/and excreted the remaining condoms during the night at the hospital in Pentridge Prison.\n\nDietrich alleged that the drugs had been planted by the police.\n\nDietrich was tried in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a trafficking offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges. During the lengthy trial, the accused had no legal representation. Although he had applied to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, it said that it would help him only if he pleaded guilty, an option that Dietrich did not want to take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge, the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to what was involved in the first three charges, he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, which refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.\n\nIn his High Court appeal, Dietrich was represented by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice since he did not have legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense because of the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.\n\nDietrich suggested three different sources in law for the right to counsel that he asserted. The first was section 397 of the \"Victorian Crimes Act 1958\" (now repealed), which provided that \"every accused person shall be admitted after the close of the case for the prosecution to make full answer and defence thereto by legal practitioner\". However, the court found that the provision means only that an accused is entitled to counsel paid for by that person or someone else, not counsel provided by the state.\n\nThe second source that Dietrich proposed was Australia's obligations under international law, particularly under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which Australia is a signatory. Article 14(3) of the Covenant provides that an accused should have legal assistance provided \"in any case where the interests of justice so require\". Article6 of the European Convention of Human Rights to which Australia is not a party also guarantees that defendants to be provided with legal aid \"when the interests of justice so require\".\n\nAustralia has not incorporated the ICCPR into its domestic law with any specific legislation, unlike some other international treaties, such as World Heritage treaties (see \"Commonwealth v Tasmania\"). However, Dietrich argued that the common law of Australia should be developed in accordance with the principles in the ICCPR, as well as other international treaties to which Australia is a party. That is the approach used in the United Kingdom, in relation to decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, for example. However, the court pointed out that the practice was usually done in relation to interpreting legislation, and in this case, the court was being asked \"to declare that a right which has hitherto never been recognised should now be taken to exist.\"\n\nThe third source that Dietrich suggested was a group of similar cases in other common law countries such as the United States and Canada. In the United States, the right to counsel was guaranteed in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, part of the United States Bill of Rights. The Amendment says that \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence\". However, that did not necessarily mean that counsel had to be provided by the state.\n\nIn the case of \"Powell v. Alabama\" in 1932, the US Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to defendants in capital trials, with capital punishment being a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own counsel. In \"Johnson v. Zerbst\" (1938), the Supreme Court expanded that principle to cover all federal trials, and in \"Gideon v. Wainwright\" (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to state courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, the court has affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation after they have been arrested (\"Miranda v. Arizona\"), and for line-ups (\"United States v. Wade\").\n\nIn Canada, Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right \"to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right\", and Canadian case law has found that as a corollary of that right, there is a right to legal aid.\n\nAlthough it is common for Australian courts to acknowledge developments in other common law countries, including the United States and Canada, the law in those countries on the right to counsel is based on particular provisions of the Constitutions or Bills of Rights of those countries. Australia had no such provisions of rights in either the Constitution or in legislation. In taking that into account, it was argued by the court:\n\nThe High Court also examined a number of related propositions. In particular, it pointed out that when interpreting the legislation which established legal aid services, Australian courts did not recognise an absolute right to counsel in all circumstances and so the state does not need to provide counsel for the duration of the trial. The court also raised the question of what a right to counsel would actually mean in practice: would a right to counsel at public expense entitle a person to counsel of a certain degree of experience? Furthermore, the court suggested that having a right to representation would necessarily imply that a trial conducted without the accused being legally represented would necessarily be unfair, which has been rejected by the Australian courts. The accused must have lost a \"real chance of acquittal\" before a trial can be regarded as unfair. Essentially, Australian common law recognised a right to a fair trial, but the question of whether the lack of representation caused an unfair trial had to be based on the particular circumstances of each case.\n\nDietrich's other argument was that the trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself and that the failure to do so caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was in the interests of the community for the matter to be dealt with promptly.\n\nThe High Court said that the trial judge did not seem to be aware that he had the authority to adjourn the trial. Another factor that complicated the case was that although the jury found Dietrich guilty of importing the heroin in the condoms, it found him not guilty of owning the heroin which had been hidden in a plastic bag. For the High Court, that uncertainty meant that it was possible that Dietrich could also have been acquitted of the other charges if he had been legally represented:\n\nSignificantly, the possibility that Dietrich may have been acquitted differentiates the case from the unsuccessful 1979 \"McInnis v R.\" appeal. McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction by arguing that the failure to adjourn the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, the majority in the McInnis appeal found that McInnis was very unlikely to have been acquitted, even with full representation. That was clearly not the case with Dietrich.\n\nThe majority in the High Court decided that although there was no right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, some cases make representation appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a trial judge should use the power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel.\n\nTwo of the judges, Deane and Gaudron JJ, went further and suggested that the right to representation in some circumstances is founded in the Constitution. They claimed that Chapter III of the Constitution, which represents the Judicature with the notion of separation of powers and vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, requires judicial process and fairness to be observed. Another two judges, Brennan and Dawson JJ, dissented, Brennan J argued that it would not be proper for judges to use their power to adjourn trials to put pressure on the various legal aid agencies to change their decisions.\n\nAs a result of the majority decision, the court ordered the application to appeal to be granted, the conviction be quashed and Dietrich to be granted a new trial.\n\nThe case reinvigorated debate about who should be provided with legal aid and raised the possibility that those charged with serious offences could escape conviction if legal aid was not provided. That placed pressure on the legal aid authorities to fund those cases and fears emerged that they would need to pull funds from other cases to meet the new demands, especially when faced with \"complex criminal cases\" that may entail high costs over extended periods of time. Although there are no precise figures about the effect of the decision on legal aid budgets, a Senate inquiry agreed that the decision had the potential to divert legal aid funding towards criminal cases, at the expense of civil or family law matters. Among the solutions to those problems were proposals for the state legal aid commissions to maintain \"emergency funds\" that could be used in major criminal cases; the South Australian \"Criminal Law (Legal Representation) Act 2002\", which was designed to allow the courts to seize a defendant's assets to prevent false claims under the Dietrich principle; and the introduction of legislation in the Parliament of Victoria amending the Crimes Act 1958 to allow judges to directly order for legal aid funding to be granted, rather than simply ordering a stay.\n\nAlthough the High Court ordered for the verdict of the conviction to be overturned and for a retrial to be conducted, there was never any retrial since Dietrich had already served his sentence. Dietrich was released on parole in July 1990, and he subsequently changed his name by deed poll to Hugo Rich.\n\nIn 1995, he was convicted of three armed robberies and jailed for 13 years. Upon appeal, two of those convictions were quashed and retrials were ordered, and a third was upheld. Only one of these counts was retried, and once again, a guilty verdict was returned. In 2001, he was eligible for day leave, and he gained media attention by leaving the decision as to whether or not he should be allowed to do so up to the readers of the \"Herald Sun\". A poll conducted by that newspaper returned a convincing \"no\".\n\nAfter his release in October 2004, he once again faced court for firearms charges and then for the murder of security guard Erwin Kastenberger during an armed robbery in on 8March 2005. He was found guilty of the murder of Kastenberger in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 12 June 2009, and he was subsequently jailed for life with a non-parole period of 30 years. In 2014 the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.\n\n\n"}

The parish of Rustington includes the neighbourhood of West Preston.\n\nRustington was in World War I home to an American air base, at the east of the High Street.\n\nRustington contains a conservation area which extends from the south end of North Lane to \"The Lamb\" in The Street. Here, where trees are protected, are the largest number of pre-1850 listed buildings in the post town, with The Street and surrounding roads containing some of the finest 17th and 18th century Sussex flint cottages in West Sussex, some of which are thatched.\n\nThere is a village information centre at the Broadmark Lane car park, housed in the recently renovated WRVS building. It also houses Rustington's museum, containing artworks and artefact. The museum will re-open to the public in October 2019.\n\nRustington competes annually in the South-East in Bloom competition.

It is down the line from and measured from via .\n\nThe station is built on the sea wall, as is the railway line, and has often suffered from storm damage due its proximity to the sea. South of the station the line passes through five tunnels through the cliffs as it follows the coast.\n\nThe station was opened by the South Devon Railway on 30 May 1846. The strange wall with bricked up windows that can be seen in the car park is the remains of the engine house that used to power the trains while they were worked by atmospheric power from 13 September 1847 until 9 September 1848. At this time it was one of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's broad gauge railways.\n\nThe station initially had just one platform on the landward side with a loop line closer to the sea, but a second platform was added to serve the loop line on 1 May 1858. The original wooden station and train shed was burnt down on 14 August 1873. The South Devon Railway built a new station with the platforms connected by an iron bridge, roofed with glass. The principal buildings were constructed adjoining Station Road, and the booking office was fitted with pitch pine cornice and fittings. Star gas pendent lights were installed, and a lift for taking up luggage to the platform levels. The first-class waiting rooms were furnished with Brussels carpets and polished oak furniture. The contractor was Blatchford and Son of Tavistock and the cost was £4,000 (). The new station was re-opened on 12 April 1875\n\nAn unusual feature of the section of line running towards Teignmouth was the sudden 'dip' in the track that once existed, resulting from the demand by a local resident who did not wish to lose his view of the sea. This is noticeable in the photograph above.\n\nThe South Devon Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway on 1 February 1876, and on 20 May 1892 the line was converted to standard gauge. The Great Western in turn was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948.\n\nThe platforms have been extended several times to cope with the crowds and now nearly reach Coastguards' Footbridge, although the Exeter platform was shortened again in 1970. The decorative iron and glass canopies above the platforms were replaced by concrete beams and glass panels in 1961 but the glass has since been replaced by Perspex. Goods traffic was withdrawn on 17 May 1965.\n\nOn 22 September 1921 a Plymouth to passenger train collided with an to goods train that was shunting in the station. The passenger train, hauled by Star Class 4055 \"Princess Sophia\", failed to stop at a danger signal. Cranes cleared the line by lifting damaged wagons onto the beach, where they remained for a couple of days.\n\nOn the night of 4 February 2014, amid high winds and extremely rough seas, part of the sea wall at Dawlish was breached, washing away around of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind. The line was closed. Network Rail began repair work and the line reopened on 4 April 2014.\n\n\nThe first signal box was provided on the seaward platform beside the north end of the waiting room but this was replaced by a new two-storey signal box on 9 September 1920 on the opposite platform. So as to fit on the narrow platform the brick-built lower storey which contained the interlocking equipment was narrower than usual, with the upper storey was vaulted out from this to give a full size operating floor.\n\nAfter the summer of 1970 the signal box was only opened on summer weekends or if there were problems working along the sea wall. It finally closed on 27 September 1986 since when the trains have been controlled from Exeter. Despite attempts to find a commercial use for the redundant building, it remained empty until 2013 when it was demolished during the period 2–5 July.\n\nThe station is adjacent to the beach near the gardens at the centre of the town. The main frontage is in banded rusticated masonry. The remaining walls are rendered except for the east elevation, which faces the sea, which is in rubble stone. It has two storeys as the railway runs above street level and a café occupies most of the street frontage. The main entrance is at road level on the side served by trains to Exeter. This opens onto a booking office with an ornate ceiling from where a flight of stairs lead up to the Exeter platform, but step-free access can be obtained through a gate from the car park beside the station buildings, which is the only access route when the booking office is closed.\n\nAccess to the opposite platform is by way of a covered footbridge, the stairways of which are contained within the building. Passengers who cannot use the steps can be escorted across the barrow crossing at the south end of the station by the station staff.\n\nImmediately to the south of the station is the low Colonnade Viaduct, which carries the railway above the small river that runs through the gardens and the main footpath from the town to the beach and the South West Coast Path. To the north of the station is Coastguards Footbridge, with Coastguards Cottage, now a café, on the hill above the line to the west, and Brunel's Boat House between the line and the beach to the east.\n\nThe station buildings are Grade II listed. Simon Jenkins included in his 2017 book of the best 100 stations in Britain.\n\nThe revised timetable from 15 December 2019 has two or three Great Western Railway trains per hour calling at Dawlish in each direction. Most trains run between and although some start or finish at . On Sundays the service is less frequent and most trains only run between and Paignton. The line from Exeter St Davids through Dawlish to Paignton is marketed as the \"Riviera Line\".\n\nA few longer-distance Great Western Railway trains from , or from London Paddington also call at Dawlish as do CrossCountry services from the Midlands, North of England and Scotland. Most of these services, including the \"Torbay Express\" from Paddington, continue to Paignton but a few run instead to and even . At other times passengers travelling east or north catch a local train and change into main line trains at Exeter St Davids, or at Newton Abbot if travelling westwards.\n\n"}

{"id": "2084667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084667", "title": "Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front", "text": "Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front\n\nThe Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) is a political organisation active in both Pakistan-administered and Indian-administered Kashmir. It was founded by Amanullah Khan, with Maqbool Bhat also credited as a co-founder. Originally a militant wing of the Plebiscite Front, it changed its name to JKLF in Birmingham, England on 29 May 1977. From then until 1994 it was an active militant organisation. It first established branches in several cities and towns of the UK, and other countries of Europe, United States and Middle East. In 1982, it established a branch in Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir; in 1987, a branch in Indian-administered Kashmir Valley.\n\nAfter 1994, the JKLF in Kashmir Valley, under the leadership of Yasin Malik, declared an 'indefinite ceasefire' and reportedly disbanded its military wing. It committed itself to a political struggle for achieving its objective of independence for the entire region of the former princely state. The JKLF branch in Azad Kashmir did not agree with this change of direction and split off from the JKLF in the Valley. In 2005, the two groups merged again retaining the original identity.\n\nEven though the JKLF has only Muslim members, it is notionally secular. It continues to assert that a secular, independent Kashmir free of both India and Pakistan is its eventual goal. Despite having received weapons and training from Pakistani military, it regards Pakistan as an 'occupation power' and carries out political struggle against it in Azad Kashmir.\n\nThe JKLF in the Kashmir Valley was banned by Indian government under anti-terror law in March 2019.\n\nJKLF was founded by Amanullah Khan in Birmingham in June 1976 from the erstwhile UK chapter of the 'Plebiscite Front'. Maqbool Bhat is often credited as being its co-founder. Khan was born in Gilgit, studied in Srinagar and emigrated to Pakistan in 1952. Bhat was born in Kupwara and also emigrated to Pakistan after studying in Srinagar. The duo had earlier formed Jammu Kashmir National Liberation Front (NLF) in the late 1960s, along with Hashim Qureshi. The group carried out the hijacking of Ganga, an Indian Airlines plane flying from Srinagar to Jammu, in January 1971, and diverted it to Lahore. The Pakistan government returned all the passengers and crew to India, and subsequently tried the hijackers and several members of NLF on charges of being Indian agents. Khan was imprisoned in a Gilgit prison during 1970–72, released after protests broke out. Maqbool Bhat was released in 1974, and he crossed over into the Indian-administered Kashmir where he was arrested in a bank robbery.\n\nAmanullah Khan moved to England, where he received the enthusiastic support of the British Mirpuri community. The UK chapter of the Plebiscite Front was converted into the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) in May 1977. It also formed an armed wing called the 'National Liberation Army'. Amanullah Khan took charge as the General Secretary of JKLF the following February. With the active support of the British Mirpuris, the group expanded rapidly, setting up branches in Pakistan, Denmark, Holland, Germany, France, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the United States. It organised well-attended conventions in Birmingham (1981) and Luton (1982).\n\nIn 1979, the JKLF planned to disrupt the international cricket match being played in Srinagar. The visiting Australian team was guarded with high security and no untoward incidents occurred.\nPraveen Swami states that the JKLF made plans to bomb the March 1983 conference of non-aligned meeting in New Delhi and to hijack an airliner from New Delhi, both of which were aborted. After the arrival of Hashim Qureshi in the UK in January 1984, another hijacking was planned.\n\nHowever, on 3 February 1984, members of the National Liberation Army kidnapped the Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre in Birmingham and demanded the release of Maqbool Bhat as ransom. Amanullah Khan was named as the interlocuter. Unfortunately, the kidnappers panicked at the possibility of a police raid and, allegedly upon Amanullah Khan's instructions, shot the diplomat. India executed Maqbool Bhat six days later, turning him into a martyr and giving JKLF the visibility it lacked earlier. A British court convicted two members of the JKLF for the killing of Mhatre. Hashim Quresi and Amanullah Khan were expelled from the UK.\n\nAmanullah Khan and Hashim Qureshi returned to Pakistan in 1984, establishing the JKLF headquarters at Muzaffarabad. Pakistan under Zia ul-Haq, which was already supporting the Khalistani militants in Punjab, was ready to support an insurgency in Kashmir, and Khan was ready to work with the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Hashim Qureshi, on the other hand, refused and went into exile in Holland. JKLF started political planning and continued till the end of 1987.\n\nFollowing the allegedly rigged state election in Jammu and Kashmir in 1987, the disaffected youth of the Kashmir Valley started crossing the Line of Control to Azad Kashmir to obtain arms and training. Khan's JKLF was their natural destination. Scholar Paul Staniland states that the JKLF was \"reborn\" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir in this period. It was led by young activists from Srinagar and environs, who crossed into Azad Kashmir for arms and training and returned to Srinagar. Yasin Malik, along with Hamid Sheikh, Ashfaq Wani and Javed Ahmad Mir, formed the core group — dubbed the \"HAJY\" group — of the JKLF militants in the Kashmir Valley. The enormity of popular support received for their call for independence surprised them. Within two years, the JKLF in the Valley emerged as the \"vanguard and spearhead of a popular uprising\" against the Indian state.\n\nThe JKLF waged a guerrilla war with the Indian security forces, kidnapping of Rubiya Sayeed, the daughter of Indian Home Minister, and targeting attacks on the government and security officials. In March 1990, Ashfaq Wani was killed in a battle with Indian security forces. In August 1990, Yasin Malik was captured in a wounded condition. He was imprisoned until May 1994. Hamid Sheikh was also captured in 1992 but released by the Border Security Force to counteract the pro-Pakistan guerrillas. By 1992, the majority of the JKLF militants were killed or captured.\n\nA pro-independence JKLF was not in Pakistan's interest. Pakistan is believed to have accepted the collaboration with JKLF only as a \"necessary compromise,\" because the Islamist groups did not yet have currency in the Kashmir Valley. However, the cadres of Islamist groups were also trained in the JKLF training camps in Azad Kashmir. This quickly led to a dilution of the JKLF's nationalist ideology. Independence and Islam became interchangeable slogans. The Islamist attacks that ensued on Kashmiri Pandits, liberal women in general, liquor shops and beauty parlours were never condemned by the JKLF. According to Hasim Qureshi, such outrages were \"official Pakistan policy\" and the policy was endorsed by the Islamic Right as well as the Amanullah Khan's JKLF. \"The ISI ran this movement on communal lines right from the beginning,\" said Qureshi, \"and for that Amanullah and his underlings became its agents.\"\n\nBy 1992, the majority of the JKLF militants were killed or captured and they were yielding ground to pro-Pakistan guerilla groups such as the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, strongly backed by the Pakistani military authorities. Further encroachment by pan-Islamist fighters infiltrating into the Valley from Pakistan changed the colour of the insurgency. Pakistan ceased its financial support to the JKLF because of its pro-independence ideology.\n\nAfter release from prison on bail in May 1994, Yasin Malik declared an indefinite ceasefire of the JKLF. However, according to him, JKLF still lost a hundred activists to Indian operations. Independent journalists mentioned three hundred activists were killed. They were said to have been compromised by Hizb-ul-Mujahideen members, who informed their whereabouts to the security forces.\n\nMalik's call for peaceful struggle was unacceptable to Amanullah Khan, who removed him as the president of JKLF. In return, Malik expelled Khan from the chairmanship. Thus JKLF had split into two factions. The Pakistan government recognised Yasin Malik as the leader of JKLF, which further complicated the situation.\n\nEllis and Khan state that, during the Azad Kashmir elections in 1996, JKLF commanded more support than all the traditional parties, even though it was not allowed to contest elections due to its pro-Independence stance.\n\nThe JKLF split into two factions after the group based in Indian-administered Kashmir led by Yasin Malik publicly renounced violence in 1995. Their counterparts in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, led by Amanullah Khan refused to do so, thereby precipitating a split in the party.\n\nSince 1995, Yasin Malik has renounced violence and calls for strictly peaceful methods to come to a settlement on the Kashmir issue. Yasin Malik also considers the Hindu Kashmiris, about 400,000 Hindus who were driven out of Kashmir after violent attacks by the separatists presently staying in refugee camps in Jammu and other Indian cities, to be an integral part of Kashmiri society and has insisted on their right of return.\nYasin Malik said, \"We want our Kashmiri Pandit mothers, sisters and brothers to come back. It is their land. They have every right to live in it as we do. This is the time that Kashmiri Muslims must play a constructive role so that we can restore the culture for which we are famous all over the world.\"\n\nIn 2002, in an interview to Reuters, Amanullah Khan blamed Pakistani backed non-Kashmiri Muslim militants for having harmed his cause.\n\"I've been saying for the last two to three years that (non-Kashmiri militants) are changing the Kashmir freedom struggle into terrorism.\"\n\nAfter the December 2001 attack on Indian Parliament, Amanullah's name figured in the list of 20 wanted terrorists India provided to Pakistan to be extradited for various terrorism-related offences. In January 2002, Amanullah Khan offered to surrender to Indian authorities provided an \"international court issued a verdict against him\".\n\nIn 2005, India allowed Yasin Malik to visit Pakistan for the first time. The two leaders, Malik and Khan seized the opportunity to meet each other in Pakistan. In June 2005, a decade after the split, Malik and Khan agreed to reunite the JKLF. The JKLF in Pakistan-administered Kashmir is currently under the leadership of Sardar Saghir Ahmad.\n\nIn December 2005, some senior members of the JKLF separated from Yasin Malik and formed a new JKLF with Farooq Siddiqi (\"Farooq Papa\") as its Chairman along with Javed Mir, Salim Nannaji and Iqbal Gundroo, later joined by former militant Bitta Karate. Lately Tahir Mir, former chief of Students Liberation Front, too parted ways with Malik and joined JKLF headed by Farooq Papa. Kashmir watchers think that Yasin Malik's shifting policy of seeking an internal solution with India after its alleged secret meeting with the Prime Minister of India led to the secession of its senior leaders. Farooq Papa supports the involvement of the European Union in resolving the dispute, and has called on EU officials to follow up the visit of an ad hoc European parliament delegation to Kashmir in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2084670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084670", "title": "Neath and Tennant Canal", "text": "Neath and Tennant Canal\n\nThe Neath and Tennant Canals are two independent but linked canals in South Wales that are usually regarded as a single canal. The Neath Canal was opened from Glynneath to Melincryddan, to the south of Neath, in 1795 and extended to Giant's Grave in 1799, in order to provide better shipping facilities. With several small later extensions it reached its final destination at Briton Ferry. No traffic figures are available, but it was successful, as dividends of 16 per cent were paid on the shares. The canal was long and included 19 locks.\n\nThe Tennant Canal was a development of the Glan-y-wern Canal, which was built across Crymlyn Bog to transport coal from a colliery on its northern edge to a creek on the River Neath called Red Jacket Pill. It closed after 20 years, but was enlarged and extended by George Tennant in 1818, to provide a navigable link from the River Neath to the River Tawe at Swansea docks. In order to increase trade, he built an extension to Aberdulais basin, where it linked to the Neath Canal. The extension was built without an act of Parliament and there was a long delay while Tennant attempted to resolve a dispute with a landowner over the routing of the canal. Once opened, much of the Neath traffic used the Tennant Canal, as Swansea provided better facilities for transferring cargo to ships.\n\nUse of the canals for navigation ceased in the 1930s, but they were retained as water channels to supply water to local industries and to Swansea docks. The first attempts at restoration began in 1974 with the formation of the Neath and Tennant Canals Society. The section north of Resolven was restored in the late 1980s, and the canal from Neath to Abergarwed has been restored more recently. This project involved the replacement of Ynysbwllog aqueduct, which carries the canal over the river Neath, with a new plate girder structure, believed to be the longest single-span aqueduct in Britain. Some obstacles remain to its complete restoration. In 2003 a feasibility study was published, suggesting that the canal could become part of a small network, if it was linked through Swansea docks to a restored Swansea Canal.\n\nEncouraged by the recent grant of an Act of Parliament to authorise the building of the Glamorganshire Canal, it was resolved at a meeting at the \"Ship & Castle\" public house in Neath on 12 July 1790 to build a canal from Pontneddfechan to Neath, and another from Neath to Giant's Grave. Among those attending was Lord Vernon, who had already built a short canal near Giant's Grave to connect the River Neath to furnaces at Penrhiwtyn. Thomas Dadford was asked to survey a course, and he was assisted by his father and brother. He proposed a route which required 22 locks, part of which was a conventional canal, while other parts used the River Neath. Dadford costed the project at £25,716, but in early 1791 Lord Vernon's agent, Lewis Thomas, proposed two new cuts, and the idea of using the river was dropped soon afterwards.\nThe canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament passed on 6 June 1791, which created \"The Company and Proprietors of the Neath Canal Navigation\", who had powers to raise £25,000 by the issue of shares, and an additional £10,000 if necessary. As well as building the canal, the Canal Company could build inclined planes, railways or rollers if required, and could optionally use the bed of the River Neath. The canal was to run from Glynneath (called Abernant at the time), which was not as far up the valley as Pontneddfechan, to Melincryddan Pill at Neath, where it would join the river. Thomas Dadford was employed as Engineer, and construction started from Neath, northwards towards Glynneath. The canal had reached the River Neath at Ynysbwllog by 1792, when Dadford resigned to take up work on the Monmouthshire Canal. He was replaced by Thomas Sheasby, who failed to complete the canal by the November 1793 deadline given to him, and was arrested in 1794 for irregularities in the accounts of the Glamorganshire Canal. The canal company completed the building work by 1795, using direct labour, although the lock into the river was never built. Rebuilding of locks and other improvements continued to be made for several years afterwards.\n\nThere was no immediate pressure to extend the canal to Giant's Grave, as access to Neath for coastal vessels of up to had been improved in 1791 by the construction of the Neath Navigable Cut. However, a second Neath Canal Act was passed on 26 May 1798, to authorise an extension of about to Giant's Grave, where better facilities for transferring goods to seagoing vessels were available. Thomas Dadford again surveyed the route, but Edward Price from Gofilon acted as engineer. This part of the canal was financed by Lord Vernon, although he was also paid £600 for his Penrhiwtyn canal, which became part of the main line. The extension was completed on 29 July 1799, and terminated at a basin close to Giant's Grave Pill. Flood gates on the canal enabled water to be released into the pill to scour it of silt. The total cost of the project was about £40,000, which included 19 locks and a number of access tramways. Between 1815 and 1842, additional docks and wharfs were built at Giant's Grave, extending the canal slightly, and the canal was extended to Briton Ferry by the construction in 1832 of the Jersey Canal, which was about long, and was built without an Act of Parliament by the Earl of Jersey. Another short extension was made around 1842. The final length of the canal was .\n\nFrom the northern terminus, a tramway connected the canal to iron works at Aberdare and Hirwaun. This was built in 1803, and included an incline just north of Glynneath, which was powered by a high-pressure Trevithick steam engine. The Tappenden brothers had bought into the iron industry in 1802, and built the tramway because of high tolls on the Glamorganshire Canal, but by 1814 they were bankrupt, and had no further connections with the canal.\n\nMineral resources near the top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon be useless unless something was done.\n\nTrade steadily grew. Three small private branches were built to serve the industries of the valley. Near the top of the canal, a branch was constructed in 1800, which ran towards Maesmarchog, and was connected to collieries by nearly of tramroad. At Aberclwyd, a branch built in 1817 served the Cnel Bach limekiln on the river bank. Below Neath, a branch left the main line at Court Sart to connect to a tramroad serving the collieries at Eskyn. Although there are no figures for the tonnage carried, apart from a mention of 90,000 tons of coal in 1810, receipts increased from £2,117 in 1800 to £6,677 in 1830. Subscribers had paid a total of £107.50 for their shares, and dividends were paid from 1806, rising from £2 in 1806 to £18 in 1840. Based on the receipts, it has been estimated that some 200,000 tons of coal were carried when trade was at its peak, supplemented by iron, ironstone and fire clay.\n\nFacilities at Giant's Grave improved, and included jetties to enable ships' ballast to be landed and dumped, rather than being thrown overboard. This latter approach had caused problems at Newport for the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, where ballast had been thrown into the river, and at Cardiff for the Glamorganshire Canal, where it had been thrown into the canal basin. Efforts were also made to improve the facilities at Neath. From 1818, a Harbour Board was established, and banks of copper slag, marked with buoys, were used to confine the channel. This enabled ships of over 300 tons to reach Neath quays on spring tides, although on neap tides Giant's Grave still had to be used. From 1824, when the connection to the Tennant Canal opened, much of the trade crossed the river and passed down the western bank to the port of Swansea.\n\nThe Glan-y-wern Canal was built to connect Richard Jenkins' colliery at Glan-y-wern with the River Neath at Trowman's Hole, an inlet across the mud flats from the main channel of the river Neath, which was later known as Red Jacket Pill. Jenkins obtained a lease to build it from Lord Vernon on 14 August 1788, but died on the same day. Edward Elton took over management of the colliery, and the canal was constructed by 1790, although there was no actual connection to the river. At Red Jacket, cargos were transhipped from the small boats used on the canal to larger vessels in the pill, which was tidal. The canal remained in use for about 20 years. Elton became bankrupt and died in 1810 after which Lord Vernon, who had leased the land on which the canal was built to Elton, placed a distraint on the wharves at Red Jacket and on the barges and it became disused.\n\nGeorge Tennant incorporated the southern section into his Tennant Canal. The northern branch over the Crymlyn Bog was derelict by 1918. It branches northwards in Crymlyn Burrows and terminates at the Crymlyn Bog nature reserve, now a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The SSSI covers an area of , and has been designated because of the presence of fen and wet woodland habitats. It is also a RAMSAR site and a Special Area of Conservation. Rare flora and fauna include slender cottongrass, the fen raft spider, and groupings of rare and scarce invertebrates.\n\nGeorge Tennant, born in 1765 and the son of a solicitor in Lancashire, moved to the area in 1816, after he had bought the Rhydings estate. The Glan-y-wern Canal was unused at the time, following Lord Vernon's distraint, but Tennant, who had no previous experience with canals, decided to lease it, enlarge it and extend it. He planned to make it suitable for barges of , which would gain access to the river Neath through a lock at Red Jacket. Where the canal turned northwards across Crymlyn Bog, he would extend it to the west, to terminate at a lock into the River Tawe, near Swansea harbour. He believed that Swansea docks would provide a better shipping point than Neath or Giant's Grave, and hoped that the canal would encourage the development of the corridor through which it ran. He attempted to gain support for the scheme from local landowners, but when none was forthcoming, he decided to fund the project himself. Lord Vernon's estate had been inherited by the Earl of Jersey in 1814, and so Tennant leased the Glan-y-wern Canal from him.\n\nWork started in 1817, under the direction of the engineer William Kirkhouse, and the canal was completed by autumn 1818, running from near the east pier on the River Tawe at Swansea to the River Neath at Red Jacket. The canal was built to a grander scale than originally intended, and could be navigated by barges of . The main line was long, and the branch to Glan-y-wern was also reopened, for it supplied regular cargoes of coal. Other goods carried included timber, bark, fire-bricks and sand, but the volume of goods carried was not enough to make a profit. He negotiated with the Neath Canal, who gave him permission to build a lock into the river from their canal, either at Giant's Grave or Court Sart pill, but working canal boats across a tidal river would not have been ideal, and he did not build the lock.\nInstead, he decided to build an extension to link up with the Neath Canal basin at Aberdulais. Again he sought support from local landowners, including Lord Jersey, Lord Dynevor and the Duke of Beaufort, but again none was forthcoming. He decided to build it as a private canal, without an Act of Parliament, and work started in 1821. Engineering problems were experienced near Neath Abbey, where a cutting was required through what appeared to be quicksand. Eventually, an inverted masonry arch had to be built to contain the canal and stop the sand collapsing. The lack of an Act to authorise the canal proved to be a problem in April 1821, when L. W. Dillwyn refused permission for Tennant to cut through his land to pass under the Swansea road. In February 1822, Dillwyn obtained an injunction against Tennant, who then attempted to change Dillwyn's opinion by sending a stream of important people to argue his case. Finally, in the autumn, Tennant offered the Neath Canal terms for the use of the junction which were so favourable to them that they accepted. Dillwyn, who was a Neath Canal shareholder, was sent a conciliatory letter and eventually agreed to negotiate with Tennant, whom he described as \"that terrible plague Mr. Tennant.\" The final section included the only lock on the main line, which was followed by a ten-arched aqueduct across the River Neath, and the junction with the Neath Canal. The total length of the canal, when it was opened on 13 May 1824, was , and it had cost around £20,000, which did not include the price of the land or of the harbour at Port Tennant.\n\nAt the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats could enter Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His terminus was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was constructed by the Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal water by passing through the dock, and a wharf for the canal was constructed at the eastern end of the dock. Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the dock was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter the dock, even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a lay-by berth was provided on its north side.\n\nSometime before 1876 another branch was built along the south-western edge of the Crymlyn Bog to transport coal from a mine at Tir-isaf.\n\nPrior to its opening, Tennant estimated that the canal would carry 99,994 tons per year, and generate £7,915 in income. Traffic built up, and by the 1830s, annual tonnage was around 90,000 tons, but revenues were less than anticipated, and produced a profit of about £2,500 per year. Initially, it was known as the Neath and Swansea Junction Canal, but by 1845 it had become known as the Tennant Canal. The water was deep between Red Jacket and Aberdulais, and deep from Red Jacket to Swansea harbour. This provided a large reservoir of water, which was used to scour the tidal basin at Port Tennant. Boats typically carried 25 tons, which allowed them to work on the Neath Canal as well. Several short branches were built, including one to the Vale of Neath Brewery which opened in 1839 and was privately funded by the brewery. In the same year, the Glan-y-wern Canal was dredged and re-opened.\n\nGoods carried were mainly coal and culm, but also included timber, iron ore, sand, slag and copper ore, with smaller amounts of foodstuffs and general merchandise. Establishment of industries at Port Tennant, which included Charles Lambert's copperworks in the 1850s and a patent fuel works in the 1860s, resulted in increased traffic of coal, from both Glan-y-wern and Tir-isaf collieries. Tir-isaf was served by a branch built in 1863 by the Earl of Jersey, but leased to the Tennants. Traffic figures reached 225,304 tons in 1866, and then gradually declined after that, but this provided a steady revenue until 1895. The river lock at Red Jacket had a chequered history. Once the line to Aberdulais basin had been opened, it was barely used, and Tennant thought about removing it in 1832. However, it was back in use some time later, and was unused again in the 1880s, only to be rebuilt in 1898.\n\nThe canals faced competition from the Vale of Neath Railway after 1851, but remained profitable until the early 1880s, in the case of the Neath Canal, and the 1890s for the Tennant. An unusual aspect of the Tennant's success was that tolls were maintained, although tonnage dropped. Most canals at this time made significant cuts to tolls in an attempt to remain competitive with the railways. After 1883, the Neath Canal carried small amounts of silica and gunpowder, but traffic had virtually ceased by 1921. Navigation on the Neath Canal came to an end in 1934, and on the Tennant Canal soon afterwards. However, most of the infrastructure was maintained as the canals supplied water to local industries.\n\nWhen the Glynneath bypass was built in the 1970s, the canal was culverted above Ysgwrfa lock, to allow the road to be straightened, and reduced in width beyond that, to allow the road to be widened. Above Pentremalwed lock, the road was built over the canal bed, and all traces have gone. This road was superseded by the A465 dual carriageway when it opened in 1996, and has become the B4242 road. The part which covered the final section of the canal is no longer a road, although the dual carriageway runs over the site of the Glynneath basin.\n\nAt Port Tennant, the course of the canal has been covered over by railways, roads and other facilities of the port, but continues to supply water to the Prince of Wales dock through a large culvert, which helps to maintain water levels in the docks. The Tennant canal is still owned by the Coombe-Tennant family.\n\nThe canals are the subject of active restoration projects. Local interest resulted in the formation of the Neath and Tennant Canals Preservation Society in 1974, to promote restoration of the canal, and carry out clearance and repairs using volunteers. In 2006 it was renamed the Neath and Tennant Canals Trust. They have worked alongside the two Canal companies, Neath Port Talbot Council, and a wide range of funders and bodies working for regeneration of the Neath valley, to enable significant sections of the canals to return to use.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1990 the canal benefited from job creation schemes run by the Manpower Services Commission and Youth Training Scheme to work on the northern section from Resolven to Ysgwrfa. By 1990 there was of navigable canal, including 7 restored locks and a slipway at Resolven basin. It received a 1998 Europa Nostra award for the quality of the work, and a Civic Trust Award in 1992. The £4 million project was jointly funded by the Welsh Office and the Prince of Wales Trust. The Rheola aqueduct in the middle of this section was refurbished by the Canals Society in 1990. The stream that is now carried under the canal had previously been carried over it in a cast iron trough, but was diverted through a channel cut across the canal bed after high flows overtopped the trough. This required the construction of a new aqueduct, and once completed, the Canals Society launched their trip boat, named \"Thomas Dadford\", on 12 July 1990, to provide canal trips for the public. The \"Enfys\" also provided boat trips for the Enfys Trust from the Tŷ Banc former lock-keepers cottage at Resolven, until 2008.\n\nIn 1993 the stretch of canal from Abergarwed locks to Tyn-yr-Heol lock at Tonna was polluted when iron-bearing water began discharging from a mine adit of the Ynysarwed coal mine. This turned the water orange, and deposited ferruginous sediment along the canal. A treatment plant and reedbeds were installed to clean the mine water, and this £1.6 million project was commissioned in 1999.\n\nIn 2000 the \"Thomas Dadford\" canal boat was transferred from the northern to the southern section, and began running boat trips from Neath town centre. Initially these could only run as far as Tonna. A £2.7 million project involving staged draining of the polluted sections enabled the dredging and removal of 65,000 tons of polluted sediment, and rebuilding of much of the infrastructure. This extended the navigable section north-east past Aberdulais basin to Lock Machin, a stretch of .\n\nTo extend the canal further to the north-east, a £1.6 million project was funded by the European Union Objective 1 project, the Welsh Assembly and Neath Port Talbot Council. This included complete replacement of the Ynysbwllog aqueduct, part of which had been washed away in a flood in 1979. The commercial role of the canal at that time was to provide water to industries near Swansea, so the water flow had been maintained by replacing the missing arch with pipes. 20 years later a steel footbridge was built to reinstate the towpath. Finally, the canal itself was taken over a new aqueduct, completed in March 2008. The plate girder aqueduct is believed to be the longest single span aqueduct in the UK. It is wide, and includes a footpath on both sides of the navigation channel. A new car park and slipway were provided from the B4242, and the Clun locks were renovated, to give of navigable canal from central Neath to Abergarwen. Following improvements, the towpath between Briton Ferry and Tonna has become a cycle route, in conjunction with Sustrans, the sustainable transport charity.\n\nSeveral obstacles remain before the canal restoration can be completed. To join the two navigable sections a new bridge would be needed where the canal is culverted under Commercial Road, and the infilled section to Abergarwed would need to be excavated. The original bridge at Commercial Road is buried beneath the new embankment, and so there is sufficient headroom available through the embankment without major alterations to the road level. Rebuilding of the two Abergarwed locks and Resolven lock would then create a single stretch of canal some long. Extension to the south is blocked by a bridge at water level in Neath, but in 2009 Neath Port Talbot Council commissioned the Prince's Foundation and British Petroleum to investigate options for the regeneration of the Canal Green area, between the river and the railway line, and the proposals suggested that it should be replaced by a lifting or bascule bridge.\n\nThe Tennant Canal presents few problems beyond that of the aqueduct below Aberdulais basin, which is a scheduled ancient monument, and rebuilding of the lock below that. Resolution of these issues would create around of navigable canal.\n\nAt Briton Ferry, the canal ends under the M4 motorway at a scrapyard, but there are plans to refurbish Brunel's Briton Ferry dock, just to the south, and a short extension to it would provide a good terminus. In Neath itself, a masterplan for the Canal Green area, developing both the river frontage and canal sides, has the potential to provide a canal basin and moorings for Neath.\n\nAt the opposite end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment of the road and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.\n\nAt Swansea, the Tennant Canal could be relinked to the Prince of Wales Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, which has become a large marina since the construction of a tidal barrage. This could then provide a link to a restored Swansea Canal. Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, but since then the Prince of Wales Dock has become the subject of a regeneration scheme, and a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this scheme and a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including Crymlyn Bog. The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to the Prince of Wales Dock was again outlined in that report.\n\nThe opening of the Tennant Canal in 1824 inspired Elizabeth Davies, who owned a lollipop-shop in Neath, to write a 19-verse poem, which was published by Filmer Fagg of Swansea.\n\nNeath railway station on the South Wales Main Line.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2084672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084672", "title": "Maybourne Hotel Group", "text": "Maybourne Hotel Group\n\nMaybourne Hotel Group is an Irish and Qatar owned British luxury hotel operator, which owns and manages The Berkeley, Claridge's and The Connaught hotels in London.\n\nThe Maybourne Hotel Group, formerly The Savoy Hotel Group has been operating super luxury hotels in London with origins that go back 205 years. The group was renamed when the Savoy Hotel was sold off from the original group of four iconic hotels; The Savoy, Claridges, The Berkeley and The Connaught. The oldest hotel in the group is The Connaught which was originally built as the Prince of Saxe Coburg Hotel in 1815. It was renamed The Connaught in 1917 after Queen Victoria's third son, Prince Arthur, the first Duke of Connaught. In December 2019 Maybourne acquired the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills,California and said the acquisition is part of a global expansion strategy bringing Maybourne's European luxury concept to new markets across the globe.\n\nIts legacy and heritage make the Maybourne Hotel Group one of the most prestigious and oldest hotel management companies in the world. The Maybourne name was formed when a group of Irish investors headed by Patrick McKillen bought the Savoy group of hotels from Blackstone and Colony Capital in 2003 for £750m. It was decided soon afterwards that the Savoy Hotel did not fit into the plans and was sold to Kingdom Holdings for approximately £250m. As the three remaining hotels were in a very poor state of repair, McKillen immediately set out on a grand plan to completely refurbish the properties beginning with The Connaught. Finance for the purchase of the group was provided by Anglo Irish bank. When the financial crisis hit, Anglo Irish Bank was not able to survive and the group's fully performing loans were transferred to NAMA, a bad bank created by the Government of Ireland in response to the Irish financial crisis.\n\nIn a controversial move NAMA sold the loans which were the bank's best to the UK's Barclay Brothers while the company was finalising its refinancing away from Irish banks. This gave the Barclay Brothers a once in a lifetime opportunity to launch a hostile attack on the hotel company. The Barclay Brothers owned the Ritz Hotel in London and always nurtured an interest in the three Maybourne hotels. They immediately set a pre-pack administration in motion in an attempt to eliminate McKillen's shares and take over the company. McKillen went to the High Court on the day the attack was launched and succeeded in blocking the takeover attempt. This set in motion the most expensive High Court legal action of its time. The case became extremely bitter between McKillen and the brothers lasting 5 years and costing over £50m. \nThe Barclay Brothers amassed shares from original shareholders in the Maybourne Hotel group which McKillen claimed was illegal. McKillen lost every case in the marathon legal action but effectively wore down the Barclay Brothers and their interest in the company was successfully transferred to the Qatari royal family. McKillen continues to have a substantial investment in the hotel group and personally manages the group on a day-to-day basis.\n\nTHE CONNAUGHT HOTEL\n\nThe Connaught hotel on Carlos Place, Mayfair was closed for a year of restoration in 2008. It was reopened totally restored including a modern wing with 121 rooms, an Aman Spa, an underground swimming pool and a restaurant operated by the famous 2 star Michelin chef, Helene Darroze. Currently, The Connaught trades as one of the world's highest revenue performing hotels, with its suites among the most desirable internationally. The chef, Jean George Vongerichten runs the hotel's all day dining restaurant and also the recently opened Connaught Grill. The Connaught bar has won major international awards including World's Best Bar ( Tales of the Cocktail ) and is currently voted the best bar in Europe ( World's 50 Best 2019 ).\nCLARIDGE'S\n\nClaridges opened in 1898. Designed by CW Stephens, it is located in the heart of Mayfair and became famous for its legendary art deco design. By 2004 Claridge's with its famous Art Deco lobby was also in a poor state of repair. McKillen with the architect Michael Blair won a major planning permission to excavate a five level basement under the hotel by hand. Remarkably the hotel is maintaining normal business while this work is being carried out. The newly created space will provide new amenities and services to significantly improve the guest experience for the next generation. New Spas, swimming pools, a screening room, laundries and bakeries are being created. At the same time, three new floors will be added on the roof providing some of the world's most luxurious rooms and penthouses. These works are due to be completed by 2021. In 2019, the hotel unveiled a new restaurant, Davies and Brook, run by chef Daniel Humm, former holder of World's best restaurant at Eleven Madison Park in New York. The hotel is embarking on an ongoing series of room and suite restorations, recently unveiling a new Royal Suite, an award-winning Empress Eugenie Suite and Prince Alexander Suite.\n\nTHE BERKELEY\nThe Berkeley, which was built on its present site in 1972 in Knightsbridge, has been completely renovated over the last few years. In 2017 a major contemporary front facade face lift was unveiled. It was designed by The Pritzker prize winning architect, Lord Rogers. Michelin starred chef Marcus Wareing has his famous restaurant at the Berkeley, and it is home to the award-winning Blue Bar. Hong Kong based Designer Andre Fu completed a series of new pavilion penthouse suites at the hotel in 2018.\n\nMONTAGE, BEVERLY HILLS\nOn 20th December 2019 Maybourne acquired Montage Beverly Hills, its first hotel outside London. In 2020, Maybourne will announce further plans for the re-positioning and renovation of Montage Beverly Hills, to bring the hotel more in line with the three London properties. The acquisition is part of a global expansion strategy bringing Maybourne's European luxury concept to new markets across the globe.\n\nThe Maybourne Hotel Group are pioneers of bringing bespoke, creatively designed Christmas trees to London. Their most distinguished guests from the fashion/style and art world are invited to design Christmas trees for the hotels and this has become a world famous occasion. The tradition began in 2009 when John Galliano was invited to design the Christmas tree for Claridges. Subsequently, Alber Elbaz, Dolce & Gabbana, Christopher Bailey for Burberry, Jony Ive and Marc Newson, Karl Lagerfeld, Diane Von Furstenberg and Christan Louboutin designed trees. At the Connaught, the Christmas trees has been designed by leading artists from Damien Hirst and Anthony Gormley, to Tracey Emin, Michael Craig Martin and Sean Scully. At The Berkeley, Sir Richard Rogers has created an annual light installation called ‘Snowfall’ that has become a neighbourhood landmark.\n\nTHE CONNAUGHT\n\n2019\n\nForbes Travel Guide: 5 star rating *****\n\nWorld's 50 Best Bars: The Connaught Bar is awarded second place at the World's 50 Best Bars and named Best Bar in Europe.\n\n2018\n\nWorld of Fine Wine: Hélène Darroze at The Connaught wins the prestigious 3-star award for '2018 World's Best Wine List'.\n\nAA Hospitality Awards: Helene Darroze at The Connaught awarded 5 AA Rosettes\n\nMichelin Guide: Helene Darroze at The Connaught retains two Michelin Stars\n\n2017\nFood & Travel Reader Awards: The Connaught wins Best Hotel of the Year – City\n\nMixology Bar Awards 2017: Agostino Perrone, our Director of Mixology, wins the award for 'European Mixologist of the Year', while the Connaught Bar is named 'European Bar of the Year'.\n\n2016\nAA Rosette Awards 2016: Hélène Darroze at The Connaught wins the acclaimed 5 AA Rosettes Award.\n\n10th Annual Spirited Awards: The Connaught Bar wins the awards for 'World's Best Cocktail Bar' and 'Best International Hotel Bar'.\n\nWorld of Fine Wine 2016: Hélène Darroze at The Connaught wins the prestigious 3-star award for '2016 World's Best Wine List'.\n\nTime Out London Bar Awards 2016: The Connaught Bar is awarded 'Classiest Bar' at the very first Time Out London Bar Awards.\n\n2015\nVeuve Clicquot World's Best Female Chef 2015: Hélène Darroze is named the Veuve Clicquot World's Best Female Chef 2015.\n\n2014\nGood Food Guide 2014: Hélène Darroze at The Connaught makes first entry into top 50 UK restaurants.\n\n2013\nTravel & Leisure 2013: The Connaught listed in its Top 3 World's Best Business Hotels.\n\nBilanz Magazine Hotel Awards 2013: The Connaught is awarded Best City Hotel in the World 2013.\n\nInternational Traveller Magazine Australia 2013: The Connaught is listed in its Top 100 hotels in the world.\n\nConde Nast USA Traveler Reader Awards 2013: The Connaught is awarded Best UK Hotel 2013.\n\nThe World's 50 Best Bars 2013: The Connaught Bar is awarded fourth place this year.\n\nForbes Five Star rating 2013: The Connaught is awarded a Five Star rating by Forbes Travel Guide in 2013.\n\n2012\nHotel & Lodge Awards 2012: The Aman Spa at The Connaught wins the first prize award in the spa category.\n\nFodor's 100 Hotel Awards 2012: Selected as a Global Icon award winner.\n\nHotel Cateys Award 2012: Conference and Banqueting Team of the Year 2012.\n\nFood and Travel Reader Awards 2012: 'Bar of the Year' is awarded to the Connaught Bar.\n\nConde Nast Traveller Readers' Spa Awards 2012: Aman Spa is featured in The Best Spas in the world.\n\nTales of the Cocktail Spirited Award 2012: The Connaught Bar is voted 'World's Best Cocktail Bar'.\n\n'Best Hotel Spa' -

{"id": "2084687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084687", "title": "Direct sum", "text": "Direct sum\n\nThe direct sum is an operation from abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics. For example, the direct sum formula_1, where formula_2 is real coordinate space, is the Cartesian plane, formula_3. To see how direct sum is used in abstract algebra, consider a more elementary structure in abstract algebra, the abelian group. The direct sum of two abelian groups formula_4 and formula_5 is another abelian group formula_6 consisting of the ordered pairs formula_7 where formula_8 and formula_9. (Confusingly this ordered pair is also called the cartesian product of the two groups.) To add ordered pairs, we define the sum formula_10 to be formula_11; in other words addition is defined coordinate-wise. A similar process can be used to form the direct sum of any two algebraic structures, such as rings, modules, and vector spaces.\n\nWe can also form direct sums with any finite number of summands, for example formula_12, provided formula_13 and formula_14 are the same kinds of algebraic structures (that is, all groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.). This relies on the fact that the direct sum is associative up to isomorphism. That is, formula_15 for any algebraic structures formula_4, formula_5, and formula_14 of the same kind. The direct sum is also commutative up to isomorphism, i.e. formula_19 for any algebraic structures formula_4 and formula_5 of the same kind.\n\nIn the case of two summands, or any finite number of summands, the direct sum is the same as the direct product. If the arithmetic operation is written as +, as it usually is in abelian groups, then we use the direct sum. If the arithmetic operation is written as × or ⋅ or using juxtaposition (as in the expression formula_22) we use direct product.\n\nIn the case where infinitely many objects are combined, most authors make a distinction between direct sum and direct product. As an example, consider the direct sum and direct product of infinitely many real lines. An element in the direct product is an infinite sequence, such as (1,2,3...) but in the direct sum, there would be a requirement that all but finitely many coordinates be zero, so the sequence (1,2,3...) would be an element of the direct product but not of the direct sum, while (1,2,0,0,0...) would be an element of both. More generally, if a + sign is used, all but finitely many coordinates must be zero, while if some form of multiplication is used, all but finitely many coordinates must be 1. In more technical language, if the summands are formula_23, the direct sum formula_24 is defined to be the set of tuples formula_25 with formula_26 such that formula_27 for all but finitely many \"i\". The direct sum formula_24 is contained in the direct product formula_29, but is usually strictly smaller when the index set formula_30 is infinite, because direct products do not have the restriction that all but finitely many coordinates must be zero.\n\nThe \"xy\"-plane, a two-dimensional vector space, can be thought of as the direct sum of two one-dimensional vector spaces, namely the \"x\" and \"y\" axes. In this direct sum, the \"x\" and \"y\" axes intersect only at the origin (the zero vector). Addition is defined coordinate-wise, that is formula_31, which is the same as vector addition.\n\nGiven two structures formula_4 and formula_5, their direct sum is written as formula_6. Given an indexed family of structures formula_35, indexed with formula_36, the direct sum may be written formula_37. Each \"A\" is called a direct summand of \"A\". If the index set is finite, the direct sum is the same as the direct product. In the case of groups, if the group operation is written as formula_38 the phrase \"direct sum\" is used, while if the group operation is written formula_39 the phrase \"direct product\" is used. When the index set is infinite, the direct sum is not the same as the direct product since the direct sum has the extra requirement that all but finitely many coordinates must be zero.\n\nA distinction is made between internal and external direct sums, though the two are isomorphic. If the factors are defined first, and then the direct sum is defined in terms of the factors, we have an external direct sum. For example, if we define the real numbers formula_40 and then define formula_41 the direct sum is said to be external.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we first define some algebraic structure formula_42 and then write formula_42 as a direct sum of two substructures formula_44 and formula_45, then the direct sum is said to be internal. In this case, each element of formula_42 is expressible uniquely as an algebraic combination of an element of formula_44 and an element of formula_45. For an example of an internal direct sum, consider formula_49 (the integers modulo six), whose elements are formula_50. This is expressible as an internal direct sum formula_51.\n\nThe direct sum of abelian groups is a prototypical example of a direct sum. Given two abelian groups formula_52 and formula_53, their direct sum formula_54 is the same as their direct product, that is the underlying set is the Cartesian product formula_55 and the group operation formula_56 is defined component-wise:\nThis definition generalizes to direct sums of finitely many abelian groups.\n\nFor an infinite family of abelian groups \"A\" for \"i\" ∈ \"I\", the direct sum\nis a proper subgroup of the direct product. It consists of the elements formula_59 such that \"a\" is the identity element of \"A\" for all but finitely many \"i\".\n\nThe \"direct sum of modules\" is a construction which combines several modules into a new module.\n\nThe most familiar examples of this construction occur when considering vector spaces, which are modules over a field. The construction may also be extended to Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.\n\nThe direct sum of group representations generalizes the direct sum of the underlying modules, adding a group action to it. Specifically, given a group \"G\" and two representations \"V\" and \"W\" of \"G\" (or, more generally, two \"G\"-modules), the direct sum of the representations is \"V\" ⊕ \"W\" with the action of \"g\" ∈ \"G\" given component-wise, i.e.\n\nSome authors will speak of the direct sum formula_60 of two rings when they mean the direct product formula_61, but this should be avoided since formula_61 does not receive natural ring homomorphisms from \"R\" and \"S\": in particular, the map formula_63 sending \"r\" to (\"r\",0) is not a ring homomorphism since it fails to send 1 to (1,1) (assuming that 0≠1 in \"S\"). Thus formula_61 is not a coproduct in the category of rings, and should not be written as a direct sum. (The coproduct in the category of commutative rings is the tensor product of rings. In the category of rings, the coproduct is given by a construction similar to the free product of groups.)\n\nUse of direct sum terminology and notation is especially problematic when dealing with infinite families of rings: If formula_65 is an infinite collection of nontrivial rings, then the direct sum of the underlying additive groups can be equipped with termwise multiplication, but this produces a rng, i.e., a ring without a multiplicative identity.\n\nAn additive category is an abstraction of the properties of the category of modules. In such a category finite products and coproducts agree and the direct sum is either of them, cf. biproduct.\n\nGeneral case:\nIn category theory the direct sum is often, but not always, the coproduct in the category of the mathematical objects in question. For example, in the category of abelian groups, direct sum is a coproduct. This is also true in the category of modules.\n\nThe direct sum formula_24 comes equipped with a \"projection\" homomorphism formula_67 for each \"j\" in \"I\" and a \"coprojection\" formula_68 for each \"j\" in \"I\".

{"id": "2084716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084716", "title": "Takaful", "text": "Takaful\n\nTakaful (, sometimes translated as \"solidarity\" or mutual guarantee) is a co-operative system of reimbursement or repayment in case of loss, organized as an Islamic or \"sharia\" compliant alternative to conventional insurance, which Takaful proponents believe contains forbidden \"riba\" (usury) and \"gharar\" (excessive uncertainty).\n\nUnder takaful, people and companies concerned about hazards make regular contributions (\"donations\") to be reimbursed or repaid to members in the event of loss, and managed on their behalf by a takaful operator. Like other Islamic finance products, Takaful is grounded in Islamic \"Muamalat\" (commercial and civil acts or dealings branch of Islamic law).\n\nBy the end of 2011, the takaful industry had grown to $12 billion \"contributions\" and has been forecast to reach $20 billion by 2017. The total global Takaful contributions were estimated at US$14.9 billion in 2015, representing a double-digit growth rate of 14% in 2015. The movement has been praised as providing \"superior alternatives\" to insurance that \"reinvigorate human capital, emphasize personal\ndignity, community self-help, and economic self-development\"; but also criticized as having \"dwindled\" in scope to an industry of \"conventional insurance with Arabic terminology and language of contract\".\n\nTheoretically, takaful is perceived as cooperative or mutual insurance, where members contribute a certain sum of money to a common pool. The purpose of this system is not profits, but to uphold the principle of \"bear ye one another's burden\". The principles of takaful are as follows:\n\n\nMuslims scholar have \"hardly any difference of opinion\" on \"the need for managing, redeeming and mitigating general, business and life risks covered by the insurance business\". But whether conventional insurance is forbidden (\"haram\") is disputed.\n\nIn its second session (December 1985), the Fiqh Academy of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (also called the International Islamic Fiqh Academy) ruled conventional commercial (but not social insurance) insurance \"haram\" (forbidden). Its ninth resolution stated: The commercial insurance contract, with a fixed insurance premium, as practiced by commercial insurance companies, contains substantial \"gharar\", which renders the contract defective. Consequently, it is legally forbidden. \n\nIslamic scholars began forbidding commercial insurance as early as the late nineteenth century C.E. Orthodox (i.e. most) Islamic scholars believe commercial insurance is disallowed for Muslims because it contains\nThey have two main concerns about conventional insurance:\n\nA minority of Islamic scholars argue that insurance is not like gambling because in gambling, no risk is covered and no damage is mitigated. The gamblers play a game of chance for entertainment and profit in which they can win or lose, based on a conscious decision. Insurance provides coverage for events out of the insured policyholder's control. When the policyholder collects a payout, they are not a winner, but a loser who at least has some compensation. Furthermore, while insurance involves uncertainty, \"statistical techniques and actuarial sciences have progressed to a stage where the insurance company can calculate its risks and benefits with great precision,\" so that the uncertainty involved in insurance can scarcely be called excessive in normal circumstances.\n\nIslamic scholars supporting takaful point to Qur'an \n\"Basis of Co-operation\": Help one another in \"al-Birr\" and in \"al-Taqwa\" (both: virtue, righteousness and piety), but do not help one another in sin and transgression. (Sūrat al-Māʼidah, Verse 2)\n\n\nThe fundamentals underlying takaful are very similar to co-operative and mutual principles, to the extent that the co-operative and mutual model is one that is accepted under Islamic law.\n\nThe concept of takaful has reportedly been practised in various forms since 622 AD. Muslim jurists acknowledge that the basis of shared responsibility (in the system of \"aquila\" as practised between the Muslims of Mecca and Medina) laid the foundation of mutual insurance.\n\n\"In the case of insurance, as with commercial banks, orthodox opinion prevailed,\" and with \"a consensus among Muslim scholars\" about the legitimacy of takaful and the illegitimacy of conventional insurance, the \"movement for Islamizing the contemporary insurance business\" started around the mid-1970s. In 1976, a fatwa was issued by the Higher Council of Saudi Arabia \"in favor of an Islamic model\" of insurance. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy, Jeddah of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation also approved takaful as a legitimate form of business in 1985. The Islamic Insurance Company of Sudan started as the first takaful company in 1979. By the mid 1990s, there were seven takaful companies in Sudan, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan.\n\nThe industry grew from $1.384 billion in 2004 to $5.318 billion in 2008. By the end of 2011, total takaful contributions amounted to $12 billion (as compared to $4 trillion for conventional insurance).\nIn 2005, there were 82 companies around the world engaged in takaful business (77 dedicated takaful companies, and five \"offering takaful products\" from \"Islamic windows\"). By 2006, there were 133.\nAs with the traditional forms of insurance, reinsurance of a takaful operation may be used, known as \"retakaful\". Also in 2006, AIG, a non-Muslim US-based company (with more than 88 million customers in 130 countries), established a takaful subsidiary called AIG Takaful Enaya, headquartered in Bahrain. \nAs of 2013 the leading takaful countries are \"Malaysia and the Gulf states\". It was reported in 2016 that out of total 308 takaful companies, 93 are takaful windows; however, these takaful windows own only 2.5% of the total takaful assets.\n\nThere are several models (and several variations) of how takaful can be implemented:\n\nAccording to this principle the \"al-Mudharib\" (takaful operator) accepts payment of the takaful installments or takaful contributions (premiums, known as \"ra's-ul-mal\") from investors or providers of capital or funds (takaful participants), acting as \"sahib-ul-mal\". The contract specifies how the profits (or surplus) from the operations of the takaful is to be shared in accordance with the principle of \"al-mudharabah\" between the participants (as providers of capital) and the takaful operator. The sharing of such profit may be in a ratio of 50:50, 60:40, 70:30 and so forth, as mutually agreed between the contracting parties.\n\nIn order to eliminate the element of uncertainty in the takaful contract, the concept of \"tabarru'\" (\"to donate, contribute, or give away\") is incorporated. Relating to this concept, a participant agrees to relinquish (as \"tabarru\"') a certain proportion of his takaful installments (or contributions) that he agrees or undertakes to pay, should any of his fellow participants suffer a defined loss. This agreement enables him to fulfill his obligation of mutual help and joint guarantee.\n\nIn essence, \"tabarru\"' enables participants to perform their deeds in assisting fellow participants who might suffer a loss or damage due to a catastrophe or disaster. The sharing of profit (or surplus) that may emerge from the operations of a takaful is made only after the obligation of assisting the fellow participants has been fulfilled. It is imperative, therefore, for a takaful operator to maintain adequate assets of the defined funds under its care whilst striving prudently to ensure the funds are sufficiently protected against over-exposure. Therefore, the provision of insurance coverage is in conformity with Shariah based on the Islamic principles of \"al-takaful\" and \"al-mudharabah\".\n\n\"Al-mudharabah\" is the commercial profit-sharing contract between the provider or providers of funds for a business venture and the entrepreneur who actually conducts the business. The operation of a takaful may thus be envisaged as the profit-sharing business venture between the takaful operator and the individual members of a group of participants who desire to reciprocally guarantee each other against a certain loss or damage that may be inflicted upon any one of them.\n\nOne complaint made against (most) takaful (by Muhammad Akram Khan) is that despite the talk of solidarity, (most) takaful-holders \"do not have any 'voice'\" in the management of the takaful. The \"TO (takaful operator) makes all the crucial decisions, such as rate of premium, risk strategy, asset management and allocation of surpluses and profits\". The shareholders of the TO, and \"not the takaful-holders, appoint and dismiss managers of the takaful\". Similarly, Mahmud El-Gamal complains that \"even companies that use the term \"takaful ta'āwun\" (cooperative mutual guarantee or insurance) are structured with stockholder rather than policyholder ownership\", despite the 9/2 ruling of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy that permitted insurance as \"cooperative insurance, built on the principles of voluntary contribution (tabarru') and mutual cooperation\". An exception to this state of affairs can be found in Sudan, where the takaful-holders have more say in the management of the takaful business.\n\nWhether takaful is significantly different from conventional insurance has been questioned. Islamic economist Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui writes that \"The form of organization chosen to take advantage of the law of large numbers does not change the reality. We can make insurance a not-for-profit activity (provided we can ensure efficient management), but it does not change the essential nature of what is being done.\"\n\nAccording to Rakaan Kayali, the fact that benefits for the takaful members are distributed as funds allow, rather than defined by the policy, may lead to conflict among members — if, for example, one member's claim uses up takaful funds so that another member with an equally valid claim a short time later is not compensated, or not compensated in full.\n\nAdditionally, there has been doubt cast on the legitimacy of claiming that takaful participants are making \"donations\". This is because the word \"donations\" implies giving with no expectation of worldly return. This is clearly not the case with takaful participants who are seeking insurance.\n\n\nChakib Abouzaid: Presentation of the World Islamic Insurance Directory at the World Takaful Conference (2006/07/08/09/10/11/12) www.takaful-re.ae \n"}
{"id": "2084721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084721", "title": "Tennis shots", "text": "Tennis shots\n\nIn tennis, there are a variety of types of shots (ways of hitting the ball) which can be categorized in various ways. The grip you place on will help you have different types of shots, the lower your grip means that the ball is most likely going to be a ground stroke. According to William T. Tilden, \"All tennis strokes, should be made with the body' at right angles to the net, with the shoulders lined up parallel to the line of flight of the ball .\" The serve is the opening shot of a point. Groundstrokes are hit after the ball has already bounced, and can be either forehands or backhands depending on which direction the racket is swung relative to the body. A lob is a groundstroke hit well over the head of an opponent who is positioned at the net. A passing shot is a groundstroke that is hit out of reach of an opponent at the net far to his left or right. A \"cross-court shot\" is a shot hit from the left (or right) side of one player's court to the left (or right) side of the other player's court (from each player's own point of view), so that it crosses the lengthwise centerline of the court. A \"down-the-line shot\" is one that is hit more or less parallel to, and near to, one of the sidelines, so that it never crosses the centerline.\n\nShots hit during a point without the ball having bounced are called volleys, while shots hit just a split second after the ball bounces are called half volleys. A smash is hit with the racket well above one's head with great velocity. A drop shot is a groundstroke or volley that is hit lightly so that it barely goes over the net.\n\nA \"slice\" is a groundstroke or volley hit with backspin, while a \"topspin shot\" is a groundstroke or occasionally a volley hit with topspin.\n\nThus tennis shots can be categorized according to when they are hit (serve, groundstroke, volley, half volley), how they are hit (smash, forehand, backhand, flat, side spin, block, slice, topspin shot), or where they are hit (lob, passing shot, dropshot, cross-court shot, down-the-line shot).\n\nAll shots that pass either over or around the net and land anywhere within the confines of the court, lines included (except for serves, which need to land inside the designated service box), are considered \"good\".\n\nA serve (or, more formally, a service) in tennis is a shot to begin the point. The most common serve is used is an \"overhead serve\". It is initiated by tossing the ball into the air over the server's head and hitting it when the arm is fully stretched out (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The server may employ different types of serve: a flat, a top-spin, an American twist (or kick), or a slice serve. A severely sliced serve is sometimes called a sidespin. Some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an \"ace\".\n\nThe \"forehand\" is struck from the dominant side of the body by swinging the racquet in the direction of where the player wants to place the shot. It is called a forehand because the racquet is held in such a way that if one were to strike the ball without the racquet, it would hit the palm of your hand. This is the opposite side from a \"backhand\". It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke. Beginners and advanced players often have better forehands than any other shots and use it as a weapon.\n\nThere are various grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the \"Continental\", the \"Eastern\", and the \"Western\". The key differences between grips are the different angles they create between the angle of your palm and the angle of your racquet face. You are used to sensing the direction your palm is facing, so your palm makes the most intuitive basis for sensing the direction your racquet is facing. For a number of years the small, apparently frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a \"western\" grip. Few top players used the \"western\" grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the \"western\" forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racquet, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand to devastating effect against larger, more powerful players, and many female and young players use the two-handed stroke today.\n\nThe \"backhand\" is struck from the non-dominant side of the body by bringing the racquet across the body (showing the \"back\" of your hand to the opponent) and swinging the racquet away from one's body in the direction of where the player wants the ball to go. It is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. It can be executed with either one or both hands. For most of the 20th Century it was performed with one hand, using either an \"eastern\" or a \"continental\" grip. The first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich. The Two handed backhand was used more often since it allowed easy access to power and control. Players such as Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, and Andre Agassi have used this stroke to its highest potential to win many grandslams. Two hands give the player more power so it provides the player with an advantage on power-focused shots. However, one hand is useful in that it can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, Don Budge, had a very powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and '40s that imparted topspin onto the ball. Ken Rosewall, another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a deadly accurate slice backhand with underspin through the 1950s and '60s. A small number of players, notably Monica Seles, use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.\n\nA volley is made in the air \"before\" the ball bounces, generally near the net or inside of the service line. Volleys consist of the forehand volley and backhand volley and are usually made with a stiff-wristed \"punching\" motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent's court. The half volley is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, once again generally in the vicinity of the net. From a poor defensive position on the baseline, the lob can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber (the player hitting the lob) to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, the opponent may then hit an overhead smash, a hard, serve-like shot (hit over the players head), to end the point. Finally, if an opponent is deep in his court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected drop shot, softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it.\n\nThe \"tweener\" is a rarely used shot in which a player hits the ball between his/her legs, generally with their back facing the net. Also known as the between-the-legs shot or the \"Gran Willy\" (after Guillermo Vilas, an early pioneer), it is generally performed when the player must run to recover a lob and has no time to turn back to face the net before attempting their return. The shot was pioneered in the 1970s by Guillermo Vilas and Yannick Noah, both of whom claimed to have invented it; later players to use it include Ilie Năstase, Boris Becker, Gabriela Sabatini (whose version was called the \"Sabatwini\"), Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Nicholas Kyrgios who helped popularize the shot. Forward-facing between-the-legs shots are also occasionally employed; they are sometimes called \"front tweeners\".\n\nThe \"Bucharest Backfire\" is an over-the-shoulder backward shot, generally used to recover lobs. Tennis writer Bud Collins named it in honor of Romanian player Ilie Năstase, who popularized it. Another seldom used shot is a behind-the-back shot, which, as its name suggests, is hit by crossing the preferred arm across his/her back without swinging. It is generally hit while stationary, and can occasionally be used as a volley shot. It is challenging to master as it is hard to predict where the ball may strike the racket, if not at all in most cases. Accurately hitting the ball to the desired location is also extremely hard to do.\n\nForehand Videos\n"}

{"id": "2084734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084734", "title": "Nenano", "text": "Nenano\n\nPhthora nenano (Medieval Greek: , also νενανὼ) is the name of one of the two \"extra\" modes in the Byzantine Octoechos—an eight mode system, which was proclaimed by a synod of 792. The phthorai nenano and nana were favoured by composers at the Monastery Agios Sabas, near Jerusalem, while hymnographers at the Stoudiou-Monastery obviously preferred the diatonic mele.\n\nToday the system of eight diatonic modes and two ' (\"destroyers\") is regarded as the modal system of Byzantine chant, and during the eighth century it became also model for the Latin \"tonaries\"—introductions into a proper diatonic eight mode system and its psalmody, created by Frankish cantores during the Carolinigian reform. While φθορά νενανῶ was often called \"chromatic\", the second ' was named \"nana\" (gr. φθορά νανὰ) and called \"enharmonic\", the names were simply taken from the syllables used for the intonation (enechema). The two \"\" were regarded as two proper modes, but also used as transposition or alteration signs. Within the diatonic modes of the octoechos they cause a change into another (\"chromatic\" or \"enharmonic\") genus (\"metavoli kata genos\").\n\nThe earliest description of and of the eight mode system (octoechos) can be found in the \"Hagiopolites\" treatise which is known in a complete form through a fourteenth-century manuscript. The treatise itself can be dated back to the ninth century, when it introduced the book of \"tropologion,\" a collection of troparic and heirmologic hymns which was ordered according to the eight-week cycle of the octoechos. The first paragraph of the treatise maintains, that it was written by John of Damascus. The hymns of the ' provided the melodic models of one mode called \"echos\" (gr. ἦχος), and models for the ' appeared in some mele of certain ' like ' and \"\".\n\nFor the songs in this book eight Echoi are said to be necessary. But this is not true and should be rejected. In fact the Plagios of Deuteros is mostly sung as Mesos Deuteros—e.g. «», the «» and other pieces written by Master Cosmas and Master John of Damascus \"from the Mousike\". (If, however, you try to sing the compositions of Master Joseph and others \"with the Mousike\", they will not fit, having not been composed \"according to the Mousike\"). Similarly the Plagios of Tetartos is mostly sung as Mesos Tetartos like over «» and many others. For these cases we can see that ten Echoi are used (for the repertory of this book) and not eight, only.\n\nThe author of the treatise wrote obviously during or after the time of Joseph and his brother Theodore the Studite, when the use the mesos forms, phthorai nenano and nana were no longer popular. The word \"mousike\" () referred an autochthonous theory during the 8th century used by the generation of John of Damascus and Cosmas of Maiuma at Mar Saba, because it was independent from ancient Greek music. But it seems that it was regarded as inappropriate to use these for the hymn melodies composed by Joseph and other hymns composed since the ninth century, since they must have preferred the diatonic octoechos based on the and the instead of the .\n\nThe concept of ' in the Hagiopolites was less concerned that the Nenano and Nana were somehow bridges between the modes. As an introduction of the tropologion it had to integrate the mele composed in these within the octoechos order and its weekly cycles. Since they had their own mele and compositions like the other echoi, they were subordinated to the eight diatonic according to the pitches or degrees of the mode (') of their cadences.\nThey were called Phthorai (i.e. destroyers), because they begin from their own Echoi, but the thesis of their cadences and formulas are on notes (\"phthongoi\") from other Echoi.\n\nThey had to be classified according to a certain echos of the eight-week cycle by adding the intonation \"nenano\" to the intonation of the main diatonic echos (usually abbreviated by a modal signature). For example, the intonation formula of (E) could be followed by the intonation of which leads to the (a), as a kind of \"\", which lies in between the finalis of the kyrios (b natural) and the one of its (E). Usually the diatonic (a) could end on its (D) in the diatonic genus, but the chromatic makes it end in the (E).\n\nIn the period of the psaltic art (gr. ψαλτική τέχνη, \"the art of chant\", 1261-1750) the Late Byzantine Notation used four additional phthorai for each mode, including the eight diatonic ', in order to indicate the precise moment of a transposition (\"metavoli kata tonon\"). The former system of sixteen echoi (4 , 4 , 4 , and 4 ) which was still used in the old books of the cathedral rite (asmatikon, kontakarion, etc.), was replaced by the Hagiopolitan octoechos and its two . The new book ' which replaced the former book and established a mixed rite in Constantinople, introduced into eight diatonic echoi and two phthorai. In rather soloistic chant genres, the ' were turned into the chromatic genus by an abundant use of the '. Hence, it became necessary to distinguish between the proper echos and its phthora, nenano and nana as \"extra modes\", and their use for temporary changes within the melos of a certain diatonic echos.\n\nIn his theoretical treatise about \"psaltic art\" and in response to the \"wrong ideas\" that some singers already had some years after the conquest of Constantinople (1458), the famous Maïstoros Manuel Chrysaphes introduced not only into the two and nana, but also into four which bind the to the diatonic echoi of , and .\n\nAll six , two of them belonged to the (the phthora of and the one of ), could dissolve the former melos and bind it to the of the following echos defined by the next medial signature. The diatonic was no longer the destruction of the diatonic modes and its genus, , and its tonal system, it could change each mode and its into another echos by a simple transposition. Hence, the list of mentioned in each Papadikai, was simply a catalogue of transposition signs, which were written over that where the transposition has to be done.\n\nIn that respect , as well as , stuck out, because within their own they were both directed to certain other .\n\nWhenever it stands in the melody [] of another echos, it creates its own melody [] and cadence [] which the other phthorai cannot do, and its resolution never closes into another mode apart from the . If one uses this phthora and it does not resolve [] into the echos but into another mode, this is not artistic []; for we said before that this is the by parallage [].\n\nIt was the psaltic art itself which moved the \"\" of to the one of . It is possible, that the of was needed to change again into diatonic genus. According to the New Method (since 1814) was always chromatic and based on the of , memorised as . This was Chrysanthos' way to understand Manuel Chrysaphes—probably a contemporary way, since the 17th-century Papadike introduced a seventh for .\n\nAccording to the rules of psaltic art could connect the and as well as and , as can be seen from the solfège diagram called the \"parallage of John Plousiadenos\" (see the first X in the first row around the centre of the enechema of ).\n\nDespite this possibility Manuel Chrysaphes insisted, that and its chromatic has always to be resolved as , any other echos would be against the rules of psaltic art. The living tradition today still respects this rule, since of the () has become the same like (): (D).\n\nAlready in the thirteenth century, there were interval descriptions in Latin and Arabic treatises which proved that the use of the chromatic was common not only among Greek psaltes.\n\nQuţb al-Dīn al-Shīrīz distinguished two ways of using the chromatic genus in parde hiğāzī, named after a region of the Arabian Peninsula. The exact proportions were used during changes to the diatonic genus. In both diatonic and chromatic divisions the ring finger fret of the oud keyboard was used. It had the proportion 22:21—between middle and ring finger fret—and was called after the Baghdadi oud player Zalzal. These are the proportions, presented as a division of a tetrachord using the proportions of 22:21 and 7:6:\n\n12:11 x 7:6 x 22:21 = 4:3 (approximate intervals in cents: 151, 267, 80 = 498)\n\nThis Persian treatise is the earliest source which tried to measure the exact proportions of a chromatic mode, which can be compared with historical descriptions of phthora nenano.\n\nIn his voluminous music treatise Jerome of Moravia described that \"Gallian cantores\" used to mix the diatonic genus with chromatic and the enharmonic, despite the use of the two latter were excluded according to Latin theorists:\n\nEspecially when they mix the ecclesiastical chant with the organum mode, they like not only to abandon the first mode [simple plainchant in monophonic realization?], but the confusion of both [plainchant and ars organi] includes another [confusion of the diatonic] with the other genera, because they associate the enharmonic diesis and the chromatic trihemitonium with the diatonic genus. They replace the semitonium by the tonus and vice versa, in doing so they differ from the other nations, as far as chant is concerned.\n\nDuring the seventies of the thirteenth century Jerome met the famous singers in Paris who were well skilled in the artistic performance of \"ars organi,\" which is evident by the chant manuscripts of the Abbey Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, of the Abbey Saint-Denis, and of the Notre Dame school. Despite the fact that no other Latin treatise ever mentioned that the singers were allowed to use enharmonic or chromatic intervals, and certainly not the transposition practice which was used sometimes by Greek psaltes, they obviously felt free enough to use both during the improvisation of organum—and probably, they became so familiar with the described enharmonic chromaticism, that they even used it during the monophonic performance of plainchant. Jerome as an educated listener regarded it as a \"confusion\" between monophonic and polyphonic performance style. Whatever his opinion about the performance style of Parisian cantores, the detailed description fit well to the use of the phthora nenano as an \"echos kratema\", as it was mentioned in the later Greek treatises after the end of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nAccording to a Papadike treatise in a sixteenth-century manuscript (Athens, National Library, Ms. 899 [EBE 899], fol.3f), the anonymous author even argues that and are rather independent modes than , because singers as well as composers can create whole kratemata out of them.\n\nThere are two phthorai which can be sung as those [of the Octoechos]: νανὰ and νενανὼ. There are also the phthorai of the other <nowiki>[</nowiki>kyrioi<nowiki>]</nowiki> echoi, but those are not as perfect <nowiki>[</nowiki>they have no proper melos like nana and nenano?<nowiki>]</nowiki>, because they just cause a temporary transition [] from one to another echos, while the former have been used by composers of various epochs to create kratemata like they were <nowiki>[</nowiki>independent<nowiki>]</nowiki> kyrioi echoi. Hence, it is justified to call them rather \"perfect echoi\" than just \"phthorai\".\n\nKratemata were longer sections sung with abstract syllables in a faster tempo. As a disgression used within other forms in papadic or kalophonic chant genres—soloistic like cherubim chant or a sticheron kalophonikon. From a composer's point of view who composed within the mele of the octoechos, a kratema could not only recapitulate the modal structure of its model, but also create a change into another (chromatic or enharmonic) genus. If a composer or protopsaltes realised a traditional model of a cherubikon or koinonikon within the of , the will always end the form of the kratema in echos , only then the singer could find a way back to the main echos. In the later case the kratema was composed so perfectly in the proper melos of , that it could be performed as a separate composition of its own, as they were already separated compositions in the simpler genres like the troparion and the heirmologic odes of the canon since the 9th century.\n\nGabriel Hieromonachus (mid fifteenth century) already mentioned that the \"nenano phone\"—the characteristic step (interval) of nenano—seemed to be in some way halved. On folio 5 verso of the quoted treatise (EBE 899), the author gave a similar description of the intervals used with the intonation formula νε–να–νὼ, and it fitted very well to the description that Jerome gave 300 years ago while he was listening to Parisian singers:\n\nPlease note, what is called \"phthora\": phthora is called, if you make a half phonic step in descending [direction], (or more precisely a third of it, while [the second interval] has an ascending) one and a half, as in nenano. Listen:\n\nThis is the intonation of phthora which is ascending. Concerning the final phonic step <nowiki>[</nowiki>which was a third of tonus in a descending melos], half of it is now part of the <nowiki>[</nowiki>second<nowiki>]</nowiki> να step [] and the rest <nowiki>[</nowiki>interval is sung<nowiki>]</nowiki> on νω!\n\nThe upper small tone leading to the final note of the protos, has a slightly different intonation with respect to the melodic movement, at least according to the practice among educated psaltes of the Ottoman Empire during the eighteenth century. But Gabriel Hieromonachos described already in the fifteenth century, that the singers tend to stray away from their original intonation while they were singing the melos of phthora nenano:\n\nBecause when we sing a nenano melody, we don’t end on the tone, from which we started, but if you look at it closer, you will find that we come down to a somewhat lower pitch. The reason for this is the nenano interval; for it seems to be in some way halved, even if we are not aware of it; in other words, we perform the nenano intervals weakly in upward direction, in order to give the characteristic colour of nenano, but in downward direction [we perform them] correctly, and this causes the melody to get out of tune.\n\nLater use of the enechema (initial incantation formula) of nenano as well as the phthora (alteration and transposition sign) of nenano in manuscripts makes it clear that it is associated with the main form of the second plagal mode as it survives in the current practice of Byzantine (Greek Orthodox) chant. Furthermore, the phthora sign of nenano has survived in the nineteenth-century neo-Byzantine notation system which is still used to switch between a diatonic and chromatic intonation of the tetrachord one fourth below.\n\nIn the chapter \"About apechemata\", Chrysanthos quoted the medieval apechema of the as a chromatic tetrachord between the pitch () of and .\n\nThis intonation formulas avoids the enharmonic step (diesis) which is expected between (δ') and (α').\n\nHis exegesis of this short apechema sets the chromatic or enharmonic tetrachord between (πλ α') and (δ'), so that the diesis lies between tritos (γ') and tetartos (δ'):\n\nThe common modern enechema places the tetrachord likewise:\n\nChrysanthos of Madytos offered following exegesis of the traditional echema which was originally diatonic, but it is currently sung with the chromatic nenano intonation (see in Chrysanthos' parallage).\n\nChrysanthos' exegesis employed the concluding cadence formula of the chromatic which was obviously an exegesis based on psaltic rules, as Manual Chrysaphes had once mentioned them.\n\nHe described the correct intonation as follows:\n\n§. 245. 3:12.\n\nThe chromatic scale: D πα—[high E flat]—[high F sharp]—G δι—a κε—[high b flat]—[high c sharp]—d πα', consists of two tetrachords. In each tetrachords the hemitones are placed in a way, that the interval D πα—E βου [ὕφεσις] is the same as a κε—b ζω' [ὕφεσις], Ε βου [ὕφεσις]—F sharp γα [δίεσις] is the same as b ζω' [ὕφεσις]—c sharp νη' [δίεσις], and F sharp γα [δίεσις]—G δι is the same as c sharp νη' [δίεσις]—d πα', so that both tetarchords, D πα—G δ and a κε—d πα', are unisono. This means that the interval D πα—E βου [ὕφεσις] is unisono with the small tone (ἐλάχιστος τόνος), Ε βου [ὕφεσις]—F sharp γα [δίεσις] with the trihemitone, and F sharp γα [δίεσις]—G δι with the hemitone: 3:12—a quarter of the great tone (μείζων τόνος) [7+18+3=28].\n\nDespite of this tradition modern music teachers tried to translate this sophisticated intonation on a modern piano keyboard as \"a kind of gipsy-minor.\"\n\nIn a very similar way—like the classical intonation—also the soft chromatic intonation of the is represented as a kind of . Here according Chrysanthos of Madytos the exegesis of the traditional intonation can be sung like this:\n\nHe explained that the intonation of the modern was not based on tetraphonia, but on trichords or diphonia:\n\n§. 244. .\n\nThe chromatic scale C νη—[D flat]—E βου—F γα—G δι—[a flat]—b ζω'—c νη' is not made of tetrachords, but of trichords which are absolutely equal and conjunct with each other—in this way:\nC νη—[D flat]—E βου, E βου—F γα—G δι, G δι—[a flat]—b ζω', b ζω'—c νη'—d πα'\nIf the scale starts on G δι, and it moves towards the lower, the step G δι—F γα requests the interval of a great tone (μείζων τόνος) and the step F γα—E βου a small tone (ἐλάχιστος τόνος); likewise the step E βου—[D flat] πα [ὕφεσις] an interval of μείζων τόνος, and the step πα [ὕφεσις] [D flat]—C νη one of ἐλάχιστος τόνος. When the direction is towards the higher, the step G δι—[a flat] κε [ὕφεσις] requests the interval of a small tone and [a flat] κε [ὕφεσις]—b ζω' that of a great tone; likewise the step b ζω'—c νη' an interval of ἐλάχιστος τόνος, and the step c νη'—Cd πα one of μείζων τόνος. Among the \"phthongoi\" of this chromatic scale only the \"phthongoi\" βου, γα, and δι can be identified with the same \"phthongoi\" of the diatonic scale, while the others are moveable degrees of the mode. While this scale extends between E βου and C νη over one great and one small tone [12+7=19], the diatonic scale extends from the middle (ἐλάσσων τόνος) to the great tone (μείζων τόνος) [12+9=21], for the interval between G δι and b ζω' it is the same.\nBecause of its early status as one of the two mysterious extra modes in the system, nenano has been subject of much attention in Byzantine and post-Byzantine music theory. Papadikai like the manuscript EBE 899 and other late Byzantine manuscripts associate nenano and nana with the chromatic and the enharmonic genus, one of the three genera of tuning during Classical antiquity that fell into early misuse because of its complexity. If the phthora nenano was already chromatic during the 9th century, including the use of one enharmonic diesis, is still a controversial issue, but medieval Arabic, Persian and Latin authors like Jerome of Moravia rather hint to the possibility that it was.\n\nGreek music theoreticians such as Simon Karas continue up to the end of the twentieth century to regard the intonation nenano as \"exotic,\" although they do not always agree, whether the intonation is hard or soft chromatic. Anonymous authors like the one of the 16th-century Papadike (EBE 899) maintained, that one of the minor tones in the tetrachord of nenano should be either smaller or larger than a tempered semitone, approaching the smallest interval of a third or a quarter of a tone. The banishment of instrumental musical practice and its theory from the tradition of Byzantine chant has made it very difficult to substantiate any such claims experimentally, and traditional singers use different intonations depending on their school. The only possible conclusions can be drawn indirectly and tentatively through comparisons with the tradition of Ottoman instrumental court music, which important church theoreticians such as the Kyrillos Marmarinos, Archbishop of Tinos considered a necessary complement to liturgical chant. However, Ottoman court music and its theory are also complex and diverging versions of modes exist according to different schools, ethnic traditions or theorists. There, one encounters various versions of the \"nenano\" tetrachord, both with a narrow and with a wider minor second either at the top or at the bottom, depending on the interval structure of the scale beyond the two ends of the tetrachord.\n\nAlthough the phthora nenano is already known as one of two additional phthorai used within the Hagiopolitan octoechos, its chromaticism was often misunderstood as a late corruption of Byzantine chant during the Ottoman Empire, but recent comparisons with medieval Arabic treatises proved that this exchange can dated back to a much earlier period, when Arab music was created as a synthesis of Persian music and Byzantine chant of Damascus.\n\n\n\n"}

However, Tichborne is not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Tichborne family has held the manor since the 12th century. Tichborne House was built shortly after 1803 while a longstanding baronetcy (indicating the use of 'Sir') was held by the family.

He worked alongside Chris Moyles at BBC Radio 1, having originally been a broadcast assistant on Moyles' early morning show. He became the show's head writer and 'Director of Comedy' and moved with Moyles to the drivetime slot, and then to \"The Radio 1 Breakfast Show\", during which time the programme was known as \"The Chris Moyles Show\". In total, he spent 14 years from 1998 to 2012 working alongside Moyles.\n\nDave has also presented other shows on Radio 1 and BBC Radio 5 Live, as well as some presenting work on television, including Channel 4's \"Coach Trip\". He is a former contestant on \"Dancing on Ice\".\n\nComedy Dave was educated at Glenealy Junior School and Bedford School, the name 'Comedy Dave' came from when he ran the tuck shop in the school hall and would regularly tell jokes in order to make more sales, many included impersonations of the teachers accents. After school, Vitty studied Radio Production at college, but never had any ambitions to be on-air. He began working as a copywriter and then moved onto becoming a \"tech op\" for Radio 1 on 5 December 1996. In 1997, he then met Chris Moyles – they got on well with each other and Moyles invited Vitty to work with him on his early morning show. When Moyles transferred to drive time in 1998, Vitty went with him and became \"Comedy Dave\" after comedian Lee Hurst asked Vitty on the show who he was, he said \"Super Dave\" to which Hurst sarcastically responded \"Comedy Dave more like\" in reference to his formative years nickname. .\n\nOn 22 April 2011, Vitty and his wife, Jayne Sharp announced they were to split.\n\nVitty's regular daily contribution to \"The Chris Moyles Show\" was the \"Tedious Link\" (which launched September 2002 – a parody of Jo Whiley's now-defunct \"Tenuous Link\"), a collection of loosely connected information, where one fact lead into another by way of juxtaposition, which then eventually lead into the title of a song (or the musicians responsible for it), often a \"classic\" or memorable tune, which was usually played at precisely 9am, preceded by the Greenwich time pips. Once the song had been played he was questioned by listeners and the rest of the crew about the validity of the information given out during the \"Tedious Link\" (the theme tune from \"Treasure Hunt\" is usually played in the background). The theme music from the TV comedy show \"Bottom\" was used as the \"bed\" (underlying music) for the feature but for January 2009 Chris Moyles unveiled a new purpose-written jingle and music.\n\nAround 9:05am, Vitty sang \"Let's get ready to ramble\", signifying the start of the feature \"Half-Time in the Show\", holding onto the last syllable for a good ten to twenty seconds, in the style of Michael Buffer. This feature was dropped on the show's return for the new year in January 2009.\n\nIt was announced on the show on 11 July 2012 that Chris Moyles would be leaving the Radio 1 Breakfast Show in September 2012. Moyles went on to play Herod in a UK tour of the Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber musical \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" in September – October 2012. It was unclear what activities Comedy Dave would move on to, but on this show Moyles simply said \"We're off..\" implying that the whole team was leaving.\n\nVitty did not return when \"The Chris Moyles Show\" did in September 2015 on Radio X, as he is currently running a production company, called \"Stripey Horse\".\n\nMoyles announced in February 2011 that both he and Vitty would, in aid of Comic Relief, attempt to present Radio 1's Longest Show Ever with Chris Moyles and Comedy Dave for Comic Relief, a record previously held by Simon Mayo. The show began at 6:30am on Wednesday 16 March and at 7:31pm on Thursday 17th Moyles and Vitty reached the 37-hour mark which gained them the record for the Longest Radio Show in BBC Radio 1 history. They continued to broadcast and at 8.30am Friday 18th broke the Guinness World Records' record for the 'Longest Marathon Radio DJ (Team) Show'. By the end of the show at 10.30am, they had set a new record of 52 hours and raised £2.4 million for Comic Relief 2011 via online and SMS donations.\n\nSubsequently, the total raised has increased to £2,821,831 and with an audience of 2.84 million, it was the most popular live BBC Red Button radio feature ever. 3.8 Million people watched on the Radio 1 Website.\n\nOn 5 January 2013 Dave made his debut on BBC Three Counties Radio presenting \"Saturday Breakfast\" for two weeks.\n\nin 2018 Dave returned to early morning on the new \"Hits Radio\". It was announced on 30th May 2019 that Dave along with Gethin and Gemma are to leave the breakfast show in July, and Gemma will move to a drivetime show in Autumn 2019\n\nIn 2014 Dave set-up a production company called Stripey Horse along with Nic Franklin, Luke Hammersley and Nicola Martin.\n\nVitty was part of the comedy folk band Folk Face with Dominic Byrne who is the newsreader on \"The Chris Moyles Show\".\n\nVitty appeared on the 6th series of \"Dancing on Ice\" with British adagio ice skater Frankie Poultney. He was knocked out in the skate-off on Sunday 13 February 2011.\n\nVitty has co-presented cover shows on Radio 1 entitled \"Chappers and Dave\", with the ex- \"The Scott Mills Show\" sidekick Mark Chapman. On 30 December 2006, on the \"Celebrity Couples Edition\" of \"The Weakest Link\", Chapman and Vitty won, beating the Chuckle Brothers in the final round. They both toured student unions across the UK regularly on their 'Chappers and Dave World Tour', and raised money for both Comic Relief and Sport Relief by visiting football stadiums across the UK.\n\nVitty once accidentally fingered Simon Mayo's mum on his Radio 1 morning show for fifteen minutes.\n\nOn 28 February 2007, Vitty appeared in an edition of \"Ready Steady Cook\", beating radio colleague, and former band member of Folk Face, Dominic Byrne. He previously presented a programme called \"Shed Sports 1\" on Nuts TV and co-presented on UK Play's \"The Chris Moyles Show\".\n\nVitty appeared on BBC game show, \"Hole in the Wall\" in an episode aired on 26 September 2009. He failed to get through any of the holes except for the very first hole, although he did so very awkwardly. (One hole in which his whole team was attempting was ruled a success, but it came at a cost.)\n\nOn 29 December 2009, Vitty appeared on \"Celebrity Mastermind\", raising money for Cancer Research UK. He finished third overall on 17 points after the general knowledge round, having recovered from scoring 6 points on the first round answering questions about British motorways.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2012, David provided the narration for Channel 4 series \"Coach Trip\" for a total of four series.

The Scottish version is a common variation of the word Moray, an anglicisation of the Medieval Gaelic word \"Muireb\" (or \"Moreb\"); the \"b\" here was pronounced as \"v\", hence the Latinization to \"Moravia\". These names denote the district on the south shore of the Moray Firth, in Scotland. \"Murray\" is a direct transliteration of how Scottish people pronounce the word \"Moray\". The \"Murray\" spelling is not used for the geographical area, which is \"Moray\", but it became the commonest form of the surname, especially among Scottish emigrants, to the extent that the surname \"Murray\" is now much more common than the original surname \"Moray\". See also Clan Murray.\n\nIn addition to the Scottish derivation, the Irish version may derive from Ó Muireadhaigh, Mac Muireadhaigh. and Mac Giolla Mhuire.\n\nA considerable number of present bearers of this surname are of Scottish origin, especially in Ulster. Possible etymologies are:\n\nThe motto for Murray is . \"Murrays\" trace their heritage back to the 12th century and take their name from the province of Moray, once a local kingdom. It was during this time that the Flemish lords crossed the North Sea and established themselves in the Scottish realm. Among them was Freskin. It is possible that either Freskin or his son William intermarried with the ancient royal house of Moray. The senior line of the Murrays took the surname of Sutherland and became Earls of Sutherland by 1235.\n\nThereafter, the chiefs of the Murrays were the Lords of Petty in Moray, who also became Lords of Bothwell in Clydesdale before 1253. An heir of this line, Sir Andrew Moray, was the brilliant young general who led the Scots in 1297 in their first uprising against English rule. He was mortally wounded while winning his famous victory at Stirling Bridge.\n\nHis son, Sir Andrew Murray, 4th Lord of Bothwell, third Regent of Scotland, married Christian Bruce, a sister of King Robert the Bruce. He was captured at Roxburgh early in 1333 and was a prisoner in England at the time of the Battle of Halidon Hill. He obtained his freedom in time to march to the relief of his wife, who was defending Kildrummy Castle. Sir Andrew commenced with unabated spirit to struggle in the cause of independence and died in 1338.\n\nThe last Murray Lord of Bothwell died in 1360 of the plague. By the 16th century, the Murrays of Tullibardine in Strathearn had assumed the leadership of the Murrays. This was formally confirmed by Bands of Association in 1586 and 1589.\n\nSir John became the 1st Earl of Tullibardine in 1606. Thus, the Tullibardine hegemony was firmly established among the Murrays; and George Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl was also Marquis of Tullibardine as recognized in Lyon Register as Chief of the Murrays. The 2nd Earl of Tullibardine William Murray, 1574 circa – 1628, married Lady Dorothea Stewart, heiress of the Earls of Atholl in 1629 and Marquises from 1676. To their medieval peacock's head crest (motto-Praite), they added the mermaid (motto-Tout Pret), as Lords of Balquidder; and in the seventeenth century, they took the demi-savage holding a sword and a key commemorating the capture of the last Lord of the Isles by the 1st Stewart Earl of Atholl in 1475: hence the motto Furth, Fortune, and Fill the Fetters. (Go forth against your enemies, have good fortune, and return with hostages and booty).\n\nSince 1703, the Murray's chiefs have been Dukes of Atholl. For a time in the 18th century, the Murray dukes were also Sovereign Lords of the Isle of Man, with their own coinage and parliament, The House of Keys. The 1st Duke's younger son, Lord George Murray, was the Jacobite general responsible for the highlander's successes through the early part of the 1745 uprising.\n\nMuch of the above information about the Murrays was taken from the book \"The Highland Clans\", by Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk.\n\nLord George's descendant George Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl, died in February 1996. The new Duke of Atholl is John Murray, 11th Duke of Atholl, a South African.

The museum was a renewal of the Royal Artillery Museum, with roots in Woolwich stretching back to the eighteenth century. The museum closed in 2016 but is expected to reopen in Wiltshire in 2022.\n\nThe collection was housed in some of the former buildings of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, which was Britain's principal ordnance manufacturing facility from the late 17th century until the mid-20th century. The Royal Regiment of Artillery was formed in the Arsenal in 1716 and the regiment had its home in Woolwich for over 290 years.\n\nThe forerunner of the Royal Artillery Museum was the Royal Military Repository, which was established on the Royal Arsenal site in May 1778. After a fire in 1802, the surviving artefacts were rehoused in the Old Royal Military Academy. In 1820 the main collection was moved to the Rotunda on Woolwich Common where it was opened to the public for the first time; the museum remained in the Rotunda for the next 180 years.\n\nThe collection then moved back into the Arsenal, where Firepower opened to the public in April 2001. All of Firepower's buildings were once part of the Royal Laboratory Department, which controlled the manufacture of ammunition; they are for the most part Grade II listed. The adjacent Greenwich Heritage Centre tells the story of the local people of Greenwich who worked in the Arsenal and made the guns. \n\nThe following buildings were leased to Firepower by Greenwich London Borough Council, or were previously used by the museum's predecessor:\nFirepower closed in July 2016 and its buildings were acquired by Greenwich Council, which has hopes of establishing a \"significant new cultural and heritage quarter\" on the site. The relocation of the museum was described by a board member as a \"missed opportunity\". Greenwich Heritage Centre tried to fill the gap by creating a new permanent exhibition \"Making Woolwich: The Royal Regiment of Artillery in Woolwich\". The project was supported amongst others by the Royal Regiment of Artillery, Royal Artillery Museums Ltd, Friends of the Royal Artillery Collections and the Royal Artillery Historical Trust.\n\nIt is planned that the Royal Artillery Museum will be re-established on a site at Avon Camp West, adjacent to the village of Netheravon. , a new two-storey building is scheduled to open in spring 2022. Until then, the exhibits are being stored and conserved in a museum store in Wiltshire, but there is no public access.\n\nIn 2017 it was announced that the Royal Borough of Greenwich has acquired five historic buildings around No 1 Street to create a £31 million cultural district.

It told the story of the development of artillery through the ages by way of an unrivalled collection of artillery pieces from across the centuries.\n\nThe museum had its roots in an earlier institution, the Royal Military Repository (established in Woolwich in the 1770s as a training collection for cadets of the Royal Military Academy); items which were once displayed in the Repository form the nucleus of the Royal Artillery Museum collection.\n\nThe museum continued in Woolwich until 2016. Following the closure that year of 'Firepower – The Royal Artillery Museum', the museum's historic collection has been placed in storage pending the establishment of a new Royal Artillery Museum, scheduled to open in Spring 2022 close to the home of the Gunners in Larkhill, Wiltshire https://royalartillerymuseum.com/ .\n\nThe Royal Regiment of Artillery was established by the Board of Ordnance in 1716. It began within the Warren (later renamed the Royal Arsenal) in Woolwich, which for some 250 years was Britain's principal ordnance manufacturing facility. In 1741 the Board opened a Military Academy within the Warren to train prospective officers for its Artillery and Engineer corps.\n\nIn 1778 Captain William Congreve set up a training establishment within the Warren, as an offshoot of the Royal Military Academy, to instruct officers in handling heavy equipment in the field of battle. His 'Repository of Military Machines' (soon given the title of Royal Military Repository ) was housed in a long two-storey building alongside the Carriage Works: cannons used for field training were stored on the ground floor while smaller items and models used for teaching purposes were displayed upstairs. Training initially took place on land to the east of the Warren and later moved to the woods to the west of Woolwich Common, close to the new Artillery Barracks, which are known still as 'Repository Grounds'. The Repository building itself was seriously damaged by fire (probably arson) in 1802. Those items that were saved or salvaged soon found a new home in the old premises of the Royal Military Academy, which itself moved from the Arsenal to Woolwich Common in 1806.\n\nThe Repository collection found a new home in a building of unusual provenance, secured for this purpose by the son of the Repository's founder (also named William Congreve). The Rotunda was initially erected in London in 1814 as an elaborate temporary marquee in the grounds of Carlton House. It was built for a ball given by the Prince Regent in honour of the Duke of Wellington in anticipation of victory over Napoleon Bonaparte; designed by John Nash, it was made to resemble a military bell tent. After the victory celebrations were over the building languished without a use; but in 1818 the Prince Regent authorised the Rotunda's removal to Woolwich \"to be appropriated to the conservation of the trophies obtained in the last war, the artillery models, and other military curiosities usually preserved in the Repository\" and it was rebuilt on the eastern edge of the Repository Grounds.\n\nIn its new accessible location the Repository became 'an early and free permanent public museum'. Inside, trophies and weapons were arranged around the central column with display cases all around containing models and smaller exhibits; larger artillery pieces were displayed outside.\n\nThe museum continued in the Rotunda through to the very end of the 20th century, despite attempts at various times (including in 1932, 1953, in the 1960s and 1980s) to move it elsewhere. Eventually accommodation was secured for a new museum within what had been the Royal Arsenal after the Army left the site in the 1990s. The Royal Artillery Museum in the Rotunda closed in 1999 (though the Rotunda continued thereafter to house the museum's reserve collection until 2010).\n\nFirepower – The Royal Artillery Experience opened on Royal Arsenal Riverside on 27 May 2001; it was housed in a set of buildings that had once been part of the Royal Laboratory where ammunition was manufactured on the Arsenal site. Its collections combined those of the historic Royal Artillery Museum with those of the former regimental museum of the Royal Artillery, a collection of uniforms, personal belongings and other artefacts which had been curated since 1946 by the Royal Artillery Institution and housed in the former Royal Military Academy building on the Common. (The Royal Artillery Institution Library and Archives were also moved from the RMA in 2001 into the former Royal Laboratory administrative block adjoining the museum, which was named the James Clavell Library.)\n\nThe museum told the story of the Regiment, and of the development of Artillery, in a series of galleries encompassing past and present military service. The former Paper Cartridge Factory (an innovative iron-framed building of 1855) housed the main Gunnery Hall and Historic Gallery, in which examples of guns from the 15th through to the 20th centuries were displayed. A new entrance building told the story of 'The Modern Gunner', and there was also an interactive 'Field of Fire' gallery.\n\nThe museum closed in 2016 having consistently failed to meet its target of 200,000 visitors a year. It had suffered financial problems for some years and was running at a deficit, kept afloat by cash injections from the Royal Borough of Greenwich, the Royal Regiment of Artillery and others.\n\nIt is planned that the Royal Artillery Museum collection will be displayed in a new museum on Salisbury Plain in the near future. In the meantime, the exhibits are being professionally stored and conserved in a museum stores nearby, but there is limited public access. At Woolwich a permanent Royal Regiment of Artillery gallery is planned as part of the Greenwich Heritage Centre on the Arsenal site.\nPlease visit https://royalartillerymuseum.com/ for more information on the Royal Artillery Collection and plans for the new Museum.\n"}

{"id": "2084802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084802", "title": "John Vassall", "text": "John Vassall\n\nWilliam John Christopher Vassall (20 September 1924 – 18 November 1996) was a British civil servant who spied for the Soviet Union, allegedly under pressure of blackmail, from 1954 until his arrest in 1962. Although operating only at a junior level, he was able to provide details of naval technology which were crucial to the modernising of the Soviet Navy. He was sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment, and was released in 1972 after ten. The Vassall scandal greatly embarrassed the Macmillan government, but was soon eclipsed by the more dramatic Profumo affair.\n\nBorn in 1924 and known throughout his life as John Vassall, he was the son of William Vassall, chaplain at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and Mabel Andrea Sellicks, a nurse at the same hospital. He was educated at Monmouth School. In World War II, he worked as a photographer for the Royal Air Force. After the war, in 1948, he became a clerk (clerical officer) at the Admiralty.\n\nAlthough his father was an Anglican priest, his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, a decision that led to tensions within their marriage. John himself converted in 1953.\n\nIn 1952, Vassall was appointed, still as a clerical officer, to the staff of the Naval Attaché at the British embassy in Moscow. There, he said later, he found himself socially isolated by the snobberies and class hierarchies of diplomatic life, his loneliness further exacerbated by his homosexuality, which was still illegal in both Britain and the Soviet Union at the time. He became acquainted with a Pole named Mikhailsky, who worked for the Embassy, and who introduced him to the homosexual underworld of Moscow. In 1954, he was invited to a party, where he was encouraged to become extremely drunk, and where he was photographed in compromising positions with several men.\n\nThe party, arranged by the KGB, had been a classic \"honeytrap\". The Soviets used the photographs to blackmail Vassall into working for them as a spy, initially in the Moscow embassy, and later in London, following his return there in June 1956. He returned to the Admiralty, where he worked first in the Naval Intelligence Division, and then, as the clerical officer assistant to the Private Secretary, in the Private Office of Tam Galbraith, a Conservative Party politician and Civil Lord of the Admiralty. At the time of his arrest he was working in Military Branch II. During his espionage career, Vassall provided the Soviets with several thousand classified documents, including information on British radar, torpedoes, and anti-submarine equipment. His obituary-writer in \"The Times\" commented that \"Vassall was never more than a low-level functionary, but there was nothing low-level about the damage he was able to inflict\". Similarly, Chapman Pincher regarded Vassall as \"the classic example of the spy who, while of lowly rank, can inflict enormous damage because of the excellence of his access to secret information\". Pincher continued: \"I am in no doubt that the recruitment and running of Vassall was a major triumph for the K.G.B. He provided information of the highest value to the Soviet defence chiefs in their successful drive to expand and modernise the Red Navy.\"\n\nRebecca West, in her book \"The New Meaning of Treason\" (1964) demurred from the notion that Vassall was \"a weak and silly little man … This was unlikely to be the correct view of a man who for seven years had carried on an occupation [espionage] demanding unremitting industry in a skilled craft carried on in clandestine conditions, an endless capacity for dissimulation, and sustained contempt for personal danger.\" West termed him, rather, \"a professional spy, working within the conventions of his profession, [who] had no more been blackmailed into the exercise of his profession than any lawyer\". West suggested that the claim of blackmail was \"putting up a smoke-screen to conceal what he had done.\" Observing that Vassall had been well paid by the Soviets for his spying, West wrote: \"The drunken party may have taken place, but it was probably engineered so that Vassall might refer to it should his treachery ever be discovered … Only a very stupid and helpless man would have succumbed [to a blackmail threat], and Vassall was not stupid; he was extremely resourceful.\"\n\nVassall was identified as a potential spy after Anatoliy Golitsyn, a senior member of the KGB, defected to the United States in 1961. The KGB, worried that Vassall would be exposed, ordered him to cease operations until further notice. Another defector, Yuri Nosenko, added to the case against Vassall, but doubts about the evidence provided by both Golitsyn and Nosenko persisted. Vassall soon resumed his work. It had become obvious to his colleagues that Vassall had some other source of income, for he moved to an expensive flat in Dolphin Square, took foreign holidays, and was said to own 36 Savile Row suits. His annual expenditure was later estimated at about £3,000, when his official salary was £750; but he explained that he had an inheritance from a distant relative.\n\nOn 12 September 1962, Vassall was arrested and charged with spying. He made a full confession, and directed detectives to the cameras and films concealed in his flat. The documents that he admitted to stealing did not account for everything believed to have been taken, however, which led to speculation that there was another spy still operating in the Admiralty. Some have suggested that Vassall was deliberately sacrificed by the KGB in an attempt to protect the other (possibly more senior) spy. In October, Vassall was sentenced to 18 years in jail.\n\nThe scandal caused the Macmillan government considerable embarrassment, erupting as it did at the height of the Cold War, only a year before the still-more dramatic revelations of the Profumo affair. The Vassall Tribunal was held to inquire into whether the failure to detect Vassall earlier amounted to a failure of intelligence, as many British newspapers had claimed. It also investigated suggestions that the close relations between Vassall and Galbraith had been improper. However, in its conclusions it found no evidence for impropriety, and largely exonerated the government.\n\nVassall served ten years of his sentence, in Wormwood Scrubs, Maidstone and Durham prisons. Many considered him to have been a relatively innocent victim of circumstances, and he was befriended in prison by the social reformer, Lord Longford. He was eventually released on parole in October 1972.\n\nHe then wrote a memoir, published in 1975 as \"Vassall: the autobiography of a spy\". He described it as \"a kind of self-justification, not as regards my espionage activities, but as regards my position as a human being, and, perhaps, my ability to make and keep friends in all walks of life\". Rex Winsbury called the book \"[a] cross between Jennifer's Diary [the society column of \"Queen\" magazine] and James Bond, ... bewildering both for Vassall's own transparent naivety and social snobbism, ... and for the equally transparent naivety of the British Foreign Office and security forces\". Hungarian émigré George Mikes similarly concluded that it was Vassall's \"vanity, his childish snobbery, his devouring ambition and complete lack of humour that pushed him so deep into the quagmire\".\n\nVassall subsequently changed his surname to Phillips, settled in St John's Wood, London, and worked quietly as an administrator at the British Records Association, and for a firm of solicitors in Gray's Inn. He died after suffering a heart-attack on a London bus in November 1996: it was not until nearly three weeks later that the press became aware of his death.\n\nThe suggestion of an improper relationship between Vassall and Tam Galbraith inspired a memorable sketch on the satirical BBC programme \"That Was the Week That Was\", which was broadcast in 1963, in which Lance Percival played a senior civil servant detecting sexual innuendo in such conventional pleasantries as the salutation \"My Dear Vassall\" at the beginning of a letter.\n\nIn 1980 the BBC broadcast a docudrama about the affair, in which Vassall was played by John Normington as \"weak, vain and keen to be thought a gentleman\". The play caused some controversy when it became known that neither Lady Hayter, the Ambassador's wife when Vassall arrived in Moscow, nor Captain Geoffrey Bennett, the naval attaché, had been consulted or advised that they were to be portrayed: they learnt only when \"Radio Times\" was published four days before the broadcast.\n\n\n\n"}

ITN's rolling news service ultimately went on air as part of the multiplex, later joined by a business news service provided by Bloomberg. \"Club Dance\", however, never made it to air. The space released by the absence of the Club Dance and Sports Channel services from the eventual lineup was used to allow the Oneword service to end at midnight rather than the proposed 7pm, and also freed up a slot for a melodic easy-listening music service aimed at an older audience, the Saga-operated PrimeTime Radio.\n\nAfter the closure of PrimeTime Radio in 2006, the original licence was amended to allow the launch of a new classic and contemporary jazz service, TheJazz which was launched on 25 December 2006, before 31 December 2006 deadline set in the licence amendment.\n\nOn 11 February 2008 GCap announced that it was selling its interest in Digital One to Arqiva and that \"non-core\" DAB stations Planet Rock and TheJazz would be closing by the end of March 2008.

Rivas was the third player from Puerto Rico to play in the NBA (after Butch Lee and José Ortiz), and half of the first duo of Puerto Ricans to be active in the NBA simultaneously (with Ortiz). Rivas has played in the NBA, NCAA Division I, and in the Puerto Rican National Superior League (BSN), with the Carolina Giants.\n\nRivas also played internationally, in Spain, Greece, and Italy. Rivas was also a member of the senior Puerto Rican National Basketball Team for several years. He represented Puerto Rico at the following tournaments: the 1986 FIBA World Championship, in Málaga, Spain; the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, in Seoul, South Korea; the 1990 FIBA World Championship, in Buenos Aires, Argentina; the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, in Barcelona, Spain; and the 1996 Summer Olympics, in Atlanta, United States.\n\nAs a youngster, Rivas played at The San Juan Y.M.C.A, for Millin Romero. He progressed through Carolina's minor basketball tournaments, becoming one of the best centers in Puerto Rico, while he played for Levittown's Pedro Albizu Campos High School's team. Flor Melendez took note of his progress, and signed him to play for the Carolina Giants, of Puerto Rico's top-tier level league, the BSN. That year he was selected BSN Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe changes on the Carolina Giants were evident, when Rivas joined the team: From being one of the worst teams in the league, during the 1983 tournament, they got better every year. In 1987, the team almost reached the BSN playoffs, and, in 1988, the team finally reached the BSN playoffs, for the first time, having the best record in the regular season (1989 Regular Season: PPG.24.4, Reb.17.4 in 30 games).\n\nRivas attended Temple University, where he played NCAA Division I college basketball with the Temple Owls, from 1984 to 1988, going on four occasions to the NCAA post season tournament. He was coached by Hall of Fame head coach John Chaney. Temple was ranked 1st in the nation in his senior year, with a record of 34 wins and 2 losses. Playing with the Owls helped him gain experience, and improve his game in the NCAA. He became well-known in the United States, as a center who could score points, and rebound in double figures, and was a respected player among his peers.\n\nThanks to his notable NCAA Division I college basketball career, the Boston Celtics announced that they would sign Rivas for a full season, towards the end of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, in Seoul. Having coincided with José Ortiz's signing by the Utah Jazz two weeks prior, Rivas' signing by the Celtics was a cause of great celebration for Puerto Ricans, many of whom felt their efforts in basketball were finally being recognized by the NBA.\n\nWith the Celtics, Rivas had the opportunity to share playing time alongside Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Dennis Johnson, Robert Parish, Reggie Lewis, and Brian Shaw, among others. The Celtics reached the playoffs, by beating the Washington Bullets by two games, for the eighth and final playoff spot in the NBA east that year, but were swept in three games, by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons, in the playoffs' first round.\n\nBecause of his height, Rivas had to change playing positions when he arrived to the Celtics, going from playing center in Puerto Rico, to power forward in Boston.\n\nAfter that season with the Celtics, he came back to Puerto Rico, and received his first Puerto Rican League MVP honor, while playing for the Carolina Giants. That summer, he was signed by a basketball club in Spain, called Taugrés, which became his home for the next 7 years.\n\nRivas played for Taugrés in the Spanish League from 1989 until 1996, winning the Spanish King's Cup in 1995. He arrived with the Vitorian team to the FIBA European Cup (later called FIBA Saporta Cup) Finals in three consecutive years (1994, 1995, 1996) finally winning it in the 1995–96 season, against Peja Stojaković's team PAOK, and becoming the Finals MVP, with 32 points and 15 rebounds. In the 1996–97 season, he won the Spanish league with FC Barcelona and also finished runner-up of the 1996–97 FIBA EuroLeague, losing to Olympiacos from Greek Basket League. The following season went to Athens to play for AEK of Giannis Ioannidis, one of the biggest clubs in Greece, and played in another EuroLeague Final (1997–98 FIBA EuroLeague) against Ettore Messina's Kinder Bologna. In 1998, he went back to Spain, for his final year with the club Cáceres. In 1999, he played in Italy for the club Fabriano.\n\nRivas represented Puerto Rico, as a member of the senior Puerto Rican national basketball team, at the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, in Seoul, South Korea, the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, held at Barcelona, Spain, and the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, held in Atlanta. He also won the gold medal at the 1991 Pan American Games, and he also played at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, and the 1990 FIBA World Championship.\n\nRivas worked for the Orlando Magic for 9 years, as a sports broadcasting color analyst, and for 5 years, for Fox Sports in Spanish.

Renshaw shared the all-time male record of seven Wimbledon singles titles with American Pete Sampras until 2017 when Roger Federer won his eighth singles title. His six consecutive singles titles (1881–86) is an all-time record. Additionally he won the doubles title five times together with his twin brother Ernest.

Seven of those were in singles, which was a record shared with Pete Sampras which was surpassed in 2017 by Roger Federer who won his eighth title. The first six were consecutive, an achievement which has been unequaled to this day . Since 1922 the reigning champions have had to play in the main draw, making such feats considerably more difficult.

In singles play he played his twin brother Ernest Renshaw three times (1882, 1883 and 1889) in the Wimbledon final, triumphing on all three occasions. He was unable to defend his title in 1887 because of tennis elbow, the first time this injury received public attention, and during his absence took up golf. The other five titles were in the Gentlemen's doubles, partnering with Ernest. Additionally, he and his brother dominated the sport for many years in a time when the only other Grand Slam was the U.S. Championships, and by custom players did not travel far. The rise in popularity of tennis in this period became known as the 'Renshaw Rush'. In 1888 William was elected the first president of the British Lawn Tennis Association (LTA). In 1983, William Renshaw was elected posthumously into the International Tennis Hall of Fame together with his brother.\n\nHe died in Swanage, Dorset on 12 August 1904, aged 43, of epileptic convulsions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2084848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084848", "title": "Baron of the Exchequer", "text": "Baron of the Exchequer\n\nThe Barons of the Exchequer, or \"barones scaccarii\", were the judges of the English court known as the Exchequer of Pleas. The Barons consisted of a Chief Baron of the Exchequer and several puisne (\"inferior\") barons. When Robert Shute was appointed second baron in June 1579 the patent declared \"he shall be reputed and be of the same order, rank, estimation, dignity and pre-eminence to all intents and purposes as any puisne judge of either of the two other courts.\" The rise of commercial trade in Elizabethan England occasioned fraudulent application of the \"Quo minus\" writ. More taxation demanded staff at the exchequer to sift an increase in the case load causing more widespread litigation cases to come to the court. From 1580s onwards the Barons of Exchequer were no longer held in such low regard, and more likely to be Serjeants-at-law before qualification. The Inns of Courts began to exclude solicitors, and held posts for judges and barons open equally to barristers. In 1591, Regulations reflected a case in which the Lord Keeper Egerton banned solicitors from seeking cases in the Exchequer.\n\nTogether they sat as a court of common law, heard suits in the court of equity, and settled revenue disputes. A puisne baron was styled \"Mr Baron X\" and the chief baron as \"Lord Chief Baron X\".\n\nThey were originally the same judges as those of the Court of King's Bench, only becoming independent positions after the Exchequer's separation from the \"curia regis\". In the early years of the Exchequer's existence, the Barons were the chief auditors of the accounts of England, a role passed to dedicated auditors during the reign of Edward II. With the Exchequer's expansion during the Tudor era, the Barons became more important; where previously only the Chief Baron had been appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, with the other Barons mere barristers, it became practice for all Barons of the Exchequer to be Serjeants. This further increased the Exchequer's standing, since for the first time it put the Exchequer at the same level as the Court of Common Pleas and Court of King's Bench, where all judges were already required to be Serjeants. Prior to the changes of 1533, Serjeants held precedence over barons \"sitting in the high court...of great eminence\". Thereafter they held the degree of coif to qualify at the Inns of Court as the senior court at Westminster.\n\nFrom 1550 to 1579, there was a major distinction between the chief baron and the second, third and fourth puisne barons. The difference was in social status and education. All of the chief barons had been trained as lawyers in the inns of court. With the exception of Henry Bradshaw and Sir Clement Higham, both barristers-at-law, all of the chief barons who served Queen Elizabeth I, had attained the highest and most prestigious rank of a lawyer, serjeant-at-law. By 1841, the equitable jurisdiction was transferred to the Court of Chancery, which deals with pecuniary cases. \n\nBy 1272, individuals were nominated to the office of Baron of the Exchequer from time to time. From 1278, there were three Barons, with a fourth being appointed in 1296 and a fifth in 1299. By 1308, one of the Barons was recognised as \"Capitalem Baronem\" (Chief Baron). By the reforms of the reign of King Richard II, barons were not necessarily qualified special pleaders or serjeants; office was in the gift of the king, and barons were not usually permitted to refuse appointment. From then until 1478, it was recognised that there should be four puisne Barons. One was frequently named as Second Baron and rarely appointments were named as Third Baron and Fourth Baron. From then until 1547, the three puisne barons were always appointed to numbered offices, but in 1549, Edward Saxleby as successor to John Darnall was merely appointed as 'one of the Barons of the Exchequer'. However, he and his successors held the office of Cursitor Baron. An additional Baron was appointed in 1604. The number of puisnes generally remained at three until the 19th century, but there was a fourth from 1708 to 1725 due to John Smith having leave of absence to attend to the office of a Baron of the Scottish Exchequer. A fourth puisne baron was appointed in 1830 and a fifth in 1868.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2084871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084871", "title": "Scarf joint", "text": "Scarf joint\n\nA scarf joint (also known as a scarph joint) is a method of joining two members end to end in woodworking or metalworking. The scarf joint is used when the material being joined is not available in the length required. It is an alternative to other joints such as the butt joint and the splice joint and is often favored over these in joinery because it yields a barely visible glue line.\n\nIn woodworking, there are two distinctly different categories of scarf, based on whether the joint has interlocking faces or not. A \"plain\" scarf is simply two flat planes meeting on an angle relative to the axis of the stock being joined, and depends entirely on adhesive and/or mechanical fasteners (such as screws, nails, or bolts) for all strength. \"Interlocking\" scarf joints, such as a hooked, keyed, and nibbed scarves, offer varying degrees of tensile and compressive strength, though most still depend on mechanical fastening to keep the joint closed.\n\nThe plain scarf is not preferred when strength is required, so it is often used in decorative situations, such as the application of trim or moulding. The use of modern high-strength adhesives can greatly increase the structural performance of a plain scarf.\n\nThe keyed-hook scarf is common in ship and boat-building, as well as timber framing and wooden bridge construction. In large timbers such as these the scarf is virtually always secured with through bolts, and is frequently reinforced externally with iron or steel fishplates, and/or strapping.\n\nA scarf joint may also be used to fix problems caused when a board is cut too short for the application. The board can be cut in half with a tapered cut yielding a scarf joint. When the joint is glued together, the tapers are slid against each other so that the two sections are no longer in line with each other. This has the effect of making the board longer. Once the glue has set, the board can be planed down to an even thickness, resulting in a longer but thinner board.\n\nIn traditional timber framing there are many types of scarf joints used to join timbers.\n\nThe joint is formed by cutting opposing tapered ends on each member which are then fitted together. When working with wood, this gives better long grain to long grain gluing surface, which yields a stronger joint than would be achieved with a simple butt joint. The tapers are generally cut at an angle between 1:8 to 1:10. The ends of a plain scarf are \"feathered\" to a fine point which aids in the obscuring of the joint in the finished work, while in other forms of scarf the ends are frequently cut to a blunt \"nib\" which engages a matching shoulder in the mating piece.\n\nWhere scarfed joints are used in the restoration of vintage aircraft most developed countries will only issue an airworthiness certificate if all such joints have used an angle no less than 1:8.\n\nDetermination of the maximum axial force for two pieces joined by adhesive can easily be determined using two equations that can be derived from the geometry of the problem by breaking the axial force component into a tensile force and shear force normal and parallel to the scarf joint. Shear strength is assumed to be equal to σ/2. The following equations need to be adjusted if the shear strength is greater than σ/2. The two equations that give a maximum axial force are F=σ/sin(α)^2 and F=σ/sin(2α), where α is the angle from the horizontal to the joint. Both should be evaluated for a given problem, and the smaller F of the two is the magnitude of the maximum allowable axial force. The first equation accounts for failure in tension. The second equation accounts for failure in shear. Some special angles should be noted or the graphs of two equations should be compared on the same plot. The joint is weakest at α=90° due to tension limits and 45° due to shear limits. However, α=45° will be stronger than α=90° if shear strength is greater than σ/2. The joint is strongest between these two angles at 63.4°. The joint becomes stronger than 63.4° at 25.4°. At a shallow enough angle, strength of the joint continues to increase and failure will occur anywhere in the two pieces, possibly outside the joint.\n\n"}

{"id": "2084907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084907", "title": "The Heart of Midlothian", "text": "The Heart of Midlothian\n\nThe Heart of Mid-Lothian is the seventh of Sir Walter Scott's Waverley Novels. It was originally published in four volumes on 25 July 1818, under the title of \"Tales of My Landlord, 2nd series\", and the author was given as \"Jedediah Cleishbotham, Schoolmaster and Parish-clerk of Gandercleugh\". Although the identity of the author of the Waverley Novels was well known by this time, Scott still chose to write under a pseudonym. The book was released only seven months after the highly successful \"Rob Roy\". Scott was at the time recovering from illness, and wrote at an even more furious pace than usual. When the book was released, it more than matched the popularity of his last novel.\n\n\"The Heart of Midlothian\" is often regarded as Scott's finest novel. Much of the dialogue is in Lowland Scots, and some editions carry a glossary.\n\nScott signed the contract for a second series of \"Tales of my Landlord\" with Archibald Constable on 25 November 1817. He had the conception of \"The Heart of Mid-Lothian\" in his head by that date, and indeed it is possible that he had already produced the introductory chapter as early as April that year, but the main writing was done between January and July 1818. The original intention had been that \"The Heart of Mid-Lothian\" would occupy three of the four volumes and another tale the fourth, but at some stage during composition Scott decided that \"Mid-Lothian\" should be a four-volume work.\n\nFor the Porteous Riot Scott was able to draw on the extensive records of criminal trials arising from it, and these were published simultaneously with the novel as \"Criminal Trials, Illustrative of the Tale Entitled \"The Heart of Mid-Lothian,\" Published from the Original Record\". The central business of Jeanie and Effie Deans was suggested by a true story sent (anonymously) by Mrs Helen Goldie of Dumfries. Both the riot and the story of the sisters were radically reworked by Scott for his fictional purposes. For David Deans's rhetoric Scott drew extensively on the Covenanting lives by Patrick Walker (\"c\". 1666–1745), and for English dialect two compilations by Francis Grose: \"A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue\", of which he owned the third edition (1796) and \"A Provincial Glossary\" (1787.\n\nThe first edition, in four volumes, was published by Archibald Constable in Edinburgh on 25 July 1818 and became available in London on the 28th. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. It is possible that Scott had some input into the text of this novel in the 1823 \"Novels and Tales\", but the evidence is not strong. In the second half of 1829, though, he revised the text, concentrating on the first half of the work, for the 'Magnum' edition and provided notes and an introduction: it appeared as part of Volume 11, all of Volume 12, and part of Volume 13 in April, May, and June 1830. The standard modern edition, by David Hewitt and Alison Lumsden, was published as Volume 6 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 2004: this is based on the first edition with emendations principally from Scott's manuscript; the new Magnum material is included in Volume 25a.\n\nThe title of the book refers to the Old Tolbooth prison in Edinburgh, Scotland, at the time in the heart of the Scottish county of Midlothian. The historical backdrop was the event known as the Porteous riots. In 1736, a riot broke out in Edinburgh over the execution of two smugglers. The Captain of the City Guards, Captain John Porteous, ordered the soldiers to fire into the crowd, killing several people. Porteous was later killed by a lynch mob who stormed the Old Tolbooth.\n\nThe second, and main element of the novel was based on a story Scott claimed to have received in an unsigned letter. It was about a certain Helen Walker who had travelled all the way to London by foot, to receive a royal pardon for her sister, who was unjustly charged with infanticide. Scott put Jeanie Deans in the place of Walker, a young woman from a family of highly devout Presbyterians. Jeanie goes to London, partly by foot, hoping to achieve an audience with the Queen through the influence of the Duke of Argyll.\n\nJeanie Deans is the first woman among Scott's protagonists, and also the first to come from the lower classes. While the heroine is idealised for her religious devotion and her moral rectitude, Scott nevertheless ridicules the moral certitude represented by the branch of Presbyterianism known as Cameronians, represented in the novel by Jeanie's father David. Also central to the novel is the early-18th-century Jacobitism, a theme found in so many of Scott's novels. Scott's sympathies can be seen in the ideal figure of the Duke of Argyle, a moderate on these issues.\n\n\"La Vendéenne\", described by Francis Gribble as \"a drama based on the plot of \"The Heart of Midlothian\"\" was written for the stage debut of the celebrated French actress Rachel and was first performed 24 July 1837. Though, doubtless there were many unlicensed adaptations of Scott's work produced for the stage on earlier dates, \"The Heart of Midlothian\" was adapted for the stage by Dion Boucicault in the 1860s. It has been adapted for the screen twice in 1914, once under the same name, and once under the title \"A Woman's Triumph\". A television version was released in 1966. Two operas have also been based upon the novel – \"La Prigione di Edimburgo\" (Imprisoned in Edinburgh) by the Italian composer Federico Ricci (1809–1877) and \"Jeanie Deans\" by the Scottish classical composer, Hamish MacCunn (1868–1916).\n\n\"principal characters in bold\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The chapter numbering follows the Edinburgh Edition where Chapter 18 is divided in two.

After a further ten years in fashionable society, his mother retired to the convent on the Continent where she had been educated.\n\n\"The Heart of Mid-Lothian\" was the first of the full-length Waverley novels to disappoint the majority of its reviewers. Although the author's genius was not in doubt with most critics, almost all of them found the new novel prolix and the fourth volume surplus to requirements. There were objections to the plot's coincidences and to signs of hastiness. Several reviewers found it remarkable that a simple country girl like Jeanie Deans could be rendered so interesting, and her interview with Queen Caroline was generally admired. Her sister Effie was also found fascinating, though there were differing views on the moral effect of her later career. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2084908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2084908", "title": "Super Girl (TV series)", "text": "Super Girl (TV series)\n\nSuper Girl or Super Voice Girls (; literally: \"Super Female Voice\", as it is homonym with \"Super girl\") was a Chinese singing contest for female contestants, organized by Hunan Satellite Television between 2004 and 2006. The show's official name was Mengniu Yoghurt Super Girl Contest until 2009; later it was known as BBK Music Phone Super Girl Contest, after the company that sponsored the series. It was generally described as the unofficial mainland Chinese version of the global television franchise \"Pop Idol\" (2001) and became one of the most popular entertainment shows in the country. Despite \"Super Girl\"'s major popularity and success, the show was heavily criticised by Liu Zhongde, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He essentially claimed \"Super Girl\" was poison for the youth.\n\nThe program was relaunched in 2009. The Chinese title was changed to \"Happy Girls\" () though the official English title remains unchanged as \"Super Girl\". In 2011, the Chinese government banned Super Girl from airing, claiming the program to be too long. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) told the Hunan station that Super Girl broke time rules for this kind of show. They should be no more than 90 minutes long, but episodes of \"Super Girl\" can last more than three hours. More than 2.5 billion people watched the show.\n\nHuanan announced a third incarnation of the show on October 30, 2015. Auditions for the series closed on April 16, 2016.\n\nPartly inspired by the many spinoffs of the UK show \"Pop Idol\", the competition was open to any female contestant regardless of her origin, appearance, or how she sings. The almost unrestricted audition sessions drew contestants of ages ranging from 4 to 89 years old. The 2005 season attracted more than 120,000 applicants during the preliminary selection rounds, held in the five provinces of Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Henan and Zhejiang. Many applicants travelled long distances to take part in the competition hoping to become a star. Each contestant was allowed 30 seconds to perform in front of judges and find out if they were selected for the preliminary regional rounds. To prevent another overwhelming audition season, a minimum age of eighteen was later set during the 2006 season.\n\nFollowing the selection of contestants in the five regions, the competition began with the preliminary rounds. Preliminaries were held in each of the five locations where auditions were located. Television viewers were able to watch each of the preliminaries and vote for their favorite singers. Voting was conducted by telephone and text messaging.\n\nThe regional preliminaries were followed by a weekly broadcast knockout competition held in Changsha, Hunan province. Viewers called in to vote for their favourite singers, and the weakest two—as voted by the judges and the audience's weekly SMS— faced-off subsequently in a \"PK\", short for \"Player Kill\". The term is derived from kill-or-be-killed multiplayer online games. The singer with the fewest votes was then eliminated. Unlike \"Pop Idol\", the last event was contested between the final three, rather than the final two contestants.\n\nUnlike \"American Idol\", judges for the competition were selected from different backgrounds in society, but they were all still Chinese. A few dozen \"audience judges\" were selected in addition to several professional judges.\n\nThe original version of the show was known as \"Super Boy\", and aired in 2003 on Hunan Entertainment Channel, a local broadcaster based in Changsha, Hunan province in South Central China. The show was a success and its counterpart, \"Super Girl\", aired at the beginning of 2004 with the slogan, \"Sing as you want, sing out loud,\" and became the most viewed show in Hunan. However, the programme's impact was limited as the channel does not broadcast outside the province.\n\nOn May 6, 2004, \"Super Girl\" was introduced to a national audience by its producer Liao Ke through Hunan Satellite Television. In addition to broadcasting the original episodes created by Hunan Entertainment Channel, the network also developed this show in other 3 cities: Wuhan in Hubei province, Nanjing in Jiangsu province, and Chengduin Sichuan province. This show attracted an average of 10,000 contestants in each city and received nationwide attention.\n\nHunan Satellite Television introduced a second season of \"Super Girl\" on March 19, 2005. The preliminary rounds were filmed in five cities: Changsha in Hunan province, Guangzhou in Guangdong province, Zhengzhou in Henan province, Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, and Chengdu in Sichuan province. By the middle of the season, the competition captivated a nationwide audience and became one of the most watched television entertainment shows in mainland China with tens of millions of viewers.\n\nThe final episode of the 2005 season was one of the most popular shows in Chinese broadcast history, drawing over 400 million viewers, more than the China Central Television New Year's Gala earlier that year. The final peaked at 280 million viewers at a given time, dwarfing the 12-million-viewer figure for the finals of \"Pop Idol\". Despite the show being condemned by China Central Television as being \"vulgar and manipulative\", a third season of the show was launched and finished in early October 2006.\n\nOn January 18, 2006, China National Philatelic Corporation released a postage stamp issue featuring 2005 winner Li Yuchun. The set was released ahead of Li's 22nd birthday in her commemoration.\n\nOn May 11, 2009, \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", a worldwide famous television show, invited Zhang Liangying, who ranked 3rd overall in the 2005 contest, to make an American television singing debut. The subtitle of the show was \"The World's Got Talent\" and Zhang Liangying was the only East Asian singer in the show.\nSome who were not chosen as winners have also been able to enter the recording industry through other means. Ji Minjia, who ranked 5th overall in the 2005 contest, worked in Los Angeles in 2006 to help with production of the title song for Japanese anime series \"The Galaxy Railways\". On March 15, 2007, Japanese recording group Hello! Project announced Li Chun, one of the top 50 contestants in the 2006 Changsha regional, as one of two new members of Chinese ancestry of its pop group Morning Musume.\n\nThe contest has also inspired television producers to create other talent search shows, including ones based on American shows such as \"The Apprentice\".\n\nThe show was the feature of a 2007 documentary titled \"Super, Girls!\", produced and directed by independent Chinese filmmaker Jian Yi during the 2006 contest season and released at the Cambridge Film Festival. An ARTiSIMPLE Studio production, \"Super, Girls!\" is the only independent feature-length documentary ever made about the \"Super Girls.\"\n\nOne of the main factors contributing to the show's popularity was that viewers are able to participate in the judging process by sending text messages with their mobile phones to vote for their favorite contestants. During the 2005 regional contest in Chengdu alone, 307,071 message votes were cast for the top three contestants, each vote costing 0.5 to 3 yuan. This was, according to Jim Yardley of International Herald Tribune, considered as one of the largest \"democratic\" voting exercises in mainland China.\n\nOver 800 million text messages were sent during the third season of \"Super Girl\", and fan clubs began to appear throughout the country.\n\nWhile some culture and media experts praised \"Super Girl\" in blazing \"a trail for cultural democracy\" and breaking elitism in China's entertainment industry, others were quick in pointing out that the show represented a superficiality in society, \"propelled by behind-the-scenes manipulation and state-of-the-art pomp and circumstance\".\n\nLiu Zhongde of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference criticised both the show and its negative influence on society, saying the audience watches the program under a distorted mentality and in an unhealthy condition. He claimed that the government departments oversee culture and art, and they should not permit something like \"Super Girl\" to exist. He admitted it was the choice of the market while claiming it as low culture. He said it wasn't as bad as the 1983 Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign, but the elements are there: cultural invasion, suspicion of market forces, spiritual health, preservation of national culture, and allegations of popular entertainment spreading corruption among the youth, all facing off against a new concept of socialist morality.\n\nIn the end of 2011, China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) has suspended the show from future production. While the official reason for such decision is the fact that the show exceeded its airing time throughout the season, many believe that the moral issue was behind this act. This claim is reinforced by Hunan TV news spokesman, Li Hao, who admitted the network will incorporate more 'positive' content in its 2012 programs.\n\nMengniu Milk Group reportedly paid ¥14 million to Hunan Television for rights to sponsor the show's broadcast outside Hunan province beginning with the 2005 season. According to one of China's leading thinktanks, the 2005 contest was estimated to have drawn in a total of ¥766 million (US$95.75 million). Indirect business impact of the competition was estimated at several billion yuan.\n\nTelevision advertisement slots cost an average of ¥33,400 for 15 seconds in 2006, compared to the average of ¥28,000 in 2005. Advertising sales were expected to reach ¥200 million (US$25 million), nearly double that of the previous year.\n\nThe first season of \"Super Girl\" aired from May 6 to September 22, 2004. Although the winners of the competition were not promised recording contracts, the top three winners signed such deals.\n\n\nThe second season of \"Super Girl\" aired from March 19 to August 26, 2005. The announcement of Li Yuchun as the season's grand champion came under scrutiny as she had been leading voting results despite having the weakest voice among the top finalists. Despite the heavy criticism that arose during the competition season, the three 2005 finalists have been considered the most successful singers from the entire show.\n\nThe third season of \"Super Girl\" aired from April 2 to September 30, 2006. Shang Wenjie's selection as grand champion over Tan Weiwei, who is a professional vocalist from Sichuan Conservatory of Music, raised questions over each candidate's public appeal. Speculations arose that Shang, who appeared to be a copycat of Li Yuchun's image (somewhat androgynous), was voted grand champion due to the appeal of her Cinderella story.\n\nE Media CEO Long Danni stated that through this competition, in addition to singers, the judges would also be looking for budding actresses and those that excel in other areas. Some of the Super Boys would also be co-hosts for the regional contests of Super Girls. The finale took place in August.\n\n Qualified\n Eliminated\n\nThe 2011 season was won by Jeremy Duan Linxi from Yunnan. The runner-up was Cici Hong Chen.\n\n\n\n"}

It is notable in that it was the first number in Porter's first fully integrated-book musical \"Fifty Million Frenchmen\" (1929). In the original production, the song was performed by Genevieve Tobin and William Gaxton, performing the roles of Looloo Carroll and Peter Forbes, respectively.\n\nThe song has been revived and rerecorded many times since, notably by Howard McGillin and Susan Powell in 1991. There are two verses and two rounds of the chorus. The song has been described as \"a tender prequel\" to \"Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love,\" Porter's first popular song. The song has been recorded by artists including Mario Lanza, Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Doris Day, Sonny Rollins, Susannah McCorkle, Bryan Ferry, Sinéad O'Connor on \"Red Hot + Blue\" (1990). Ella Fitzgerald, the First Lady of Song, recorded this song on both her \"Cole Porter Songbook\" albums and on her Pablo classic, \"Ella à Nice\". Bing Crosby recorded the song in 1955 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set \"The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56)\" issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009. Bette Midler's version of the song plays over the final credits of the 1991 film \"Scenes from a Mall\", which starred her and Woody Allen.\n\nThe song was featured in the film Introducing Dorothy Dandridge (1999).\n\nAccording to the liner notes for \"It's De Lovely — The Authentic Cole Porter Collection\", the line \"the voodoo that you do so well\" is quoted in the 1993 Salt-N-Pepa song \"Shoop\".\n\nThe \"voodoo\" line is also quoted by Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) in the 1974 film \"Blazing Saddles\" as he exhorts his gang to attack a frontier town.\n\n"}

It is a recent development, with no skyscrapers, and the area also contains jungles atop rocky cliffs and hills. High waves permit surfing at Recreio Beach and the white sand beach is used by beach volleyball players. It is about 35 km from the Rio de Janeiro city centre, and most of the people living there are middle-class and high middle-class families, who moved in trying to escape the growing violence of both the North and South Zones.\n\nApocryphally, the neighborhood received the name Recreio dos Bandeirantes, or \"Bandeirantes' Leisure\" because the company that mapped and hired a real estate agent to sell lots there had that name. Another version says that many of the newcomers were from São Paulo, the city from which the Bandeiras departed in colonial times, and therefore Paulistas are associated with them. Still another version states that Recreio was the first (or last) resting place with fresh water for Bandeirantes traveling between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.\nDevelopment in the area began in 1959, and only more recently, have well-to-do residents discovered and made Recreio their home. It does not have the hustle and bustle of bohemic Lapa, Copacabana, Leblon, and Ipanema, but there has been an increase in the number of restaurants, pizzerias, bars, private schools and colleges. There are a few ', or slums, in the section. However, the Taxas Canal is often polluted by slum residents through trash dumping. Recreio has an organized association of residents who communicate online with tips and news about the neighborhood.

In 2005, she appeared in the ITV programme \"Celebrity Wrestling\" and went on to win it.\n\nMost recently she has been a presenter for Eurosport, Sky Sports and the BBC.\n\nAfter winning the Wimbledon and Australian Open girls' tournaments in 1984, Croft won the Virginia Slims of San Diego tournament in 1985, beating Wendy Turnbull in the final in straight sets. In December 1985, she achieved a world ranking of 24. She played for Great Britain in the Fed Cup in 1985 and 1986, and in the Wightman Cup from 1983 to 1986.\n\nDespite her potential and being amongst the world's top 25 players, Croft retired from professional tennis at the age of only twenty-one, tired of the relentless travel and keen to start a family. Reflecting on her retirement in 2011, she noted that the tour was stressful as it was like \"having an argument every day and preparing for another one tomorrow\". Immediately after her retirement, Annabel became the new face of Channel 4’s prime time show \"Treasure Hunt\", following Anneka Rice's successful run.

{"id": "2085003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085003", "title": "Still Game", "text": "Still Game\n\nStill Game is a Scottish sitcom, produced by The Comedy Unit with BBC Scotland. It was created by Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill, who played the lead characters, Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade, two Glaswegian pensioners. The characters first appeared in the pair's previous TV sketch show \"Chewin' the Fat\", which aired in Scotland from January 1999 until December 2005.\n\nFollowing its debut on 6 September 2002, 62 episodes of \"Still Game\" were aired, including Christmas and Hogmanay specials. The first three series were broadcast only on BBC One Scotland, though five episodes selected from the first two series were later broadcast throughout the UK on BBC Two from January to February 2004. From the fourth series, \"Still Game\" was broadcast across the UK on BBC Two. With the seventh series in 2016, the programme began to be broadcast on BBC One.\n\nIt was announced on 13 July 2018 that a ninth and final series would be produced later in the year which would see the characters go into \"comedy retirement\". The last day of production was on 14 September 2018, and it started airing on 24 February 2019, being one of the first programmes to be shown on the brand new BBC Scotland channel.\n\n\"Still Game\" started as a stage play featuring three characters: Jack Jarvis, Victor McDade, and Winston Ingram. Due to a broken lift, the three men are stranded in Victor's flat and discuss a variety of subjects ranging from death to sex. The stage play toured Scotland, England, Ireland and Canada before returning to Glasgow, where the show was filmed at the Cottiers Theatre in 1999 and released on video on 22 November 1999. A DVD of the show was later released on 2 December 2002\n\nA small number of revisions accompanied \"Still Game\"'s transition from stage to television. Gavin Mitchell, who originally played Winston (and was replaced by Paul Riley for later performances), played the part of Boabby in the series. Characters mentioned in passing were later fleshed out into supporting characters.\n\nIn 1998, Jack and Victor appeared in a number of skits in a tongue-in-cheek documentary about Scottish pop music called \"Och Around the Clock\". In these, they are shown to be watching while sitting in Victor's flat. Their skits centred on the duo's disparaging comments about the performers.\n\nThe characters reappeared in Kiernan and Hemphill's sketch show \"Chewin' the Fat\", nearly every episode of which featured Jack, Victor, Tam and Winston, with minor differences from their counterparts in the series. By the time \"Still Game\" became a show in its own right Winston's physical appearance had changed significantly, but he was still played by Paul Riley. As the show evolved, supporting characters assumed greater prominence. Jack and Victor made their final appearance on \"Chewin' the Fat\" in the 2002 Hogmanay Special.\n\nFor the show's first three series, the broadcast of \"Still Game\" was limited to BBC One Scotland. The show was then moved to BBC Two for the fourth series and shown throughout the UK. On 28 December 2005, the first Christmas special was shown on BBC One, the first national broadcast of the show on the channel. A fifth series of the show started filming in February 2006 and was shown the following June on BBC Two. As of 2006, series three had not been shown nationally, and only five episodes from the first two series were shown on national BBC Two from 17 January to 14 February 2004. The second series was shown nationally from 10 July 2008. This meant it was listed as a new series in TV listings, even though it was not for Scottish viewers.\n\nIn the first three series, the episode titles were all Glaswegian dialect words that were related to the episode. Starting from series four, the episodes were titled using standard English, so that general audiences could understand them.\n\nThe events of \"Still Game\" take place in a floating timeline where the characters remain the same age from series to series. One of the most prominent examples of this is that Victor reveals that he is 74 years old in \"Scran\", an episode of the second series, but it is not until the fifth series (\"Smoke On The Water\") that he celebrates his 75th birthday.\n\nThe sixth series of \"Still Game\" ended on BBC Two on 23 August 2007. A Christmas special was aired on BBC One Scotland on 23 December and for the rest of the UK on BBC Two on 28 December. There was also a Hogmanay special called \"Hootenanny\" aired on BBC One Scotland, later aired to the rest of the UK on 2 January 2008.\n\nFord Kiernan, Greg Hemphill and Paul Riley's company Effingee Productions is thought to have split up after Riley walked away to go it alone after being refused more control over the future of the company by Kiernan. Hemphill stated that he didn't want a \"boardroom battle\".\n\nOn 15 October 2013, the \"Daily Record\" ran a front-page story that the show would be returning. On 23 October 2013, Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill announced details of live shows entitled \" Still Game Live\" at The SSE Hydro in Glasgow at a press conference. They were scheduled to perform four shows beginning in September 2014, but due to high demand, it was extended to 16 and then 21 shows.\n\nThe 21 shows at The Hydro ran from 19 September 2014 until 10 October 2014, played to 210,000 fans and made £6,000,000 in ticket sales. The show received mixed reviews.\n\nIn November 2014, a special sketch featuring Jack and Victor visiting the set of \"River City\" was made for Children in Need. The sketch also featured a cameo of a director played by Still Game director Michael Hines. On Hogmanay 2014, BBC Scotland showed a documentary celebrating the show titled \"Still Game: The Story So Far\". The programme featured interviews with the cast, celebrities who have appeared on the show and super fans, including a look at some favourite moments.\n\nOn 12 May 2016, the BBC announced that the show would return in 2016 with a six-part seventh series, nine years after the previous series concluded. Filming of the new seventh series started in the summer and the series began on 7 October 2016. The show's return attracted its highest ever overnight audience for a single episode on 7 October, taking a 58% share of the Scottish TV audience with 1,300,000 viewers. The show also aired for the first time on BBC One across the UK nationwide and drew a total audience of 3,200,000.\n\nIn September 2016, a second live show \"Still Game Live 2: Bon Voyage\" was announced for the SSE Hydro. The second stage show was to run for ten nights beginning 4 February 2017, but in October 2016, a further five performances were added. Unlike the previous live show, this show was not televised or recorded in any other way.\n\nOn 16 March 2017, it was announced that an eighth series has been commissioned to air on BBC One with plans to broadcast towards the end of 2017. The series was pushed back to start on 8 March 2018.\n\nBefore the start of the eighth series, Hemphill revealed that he and Kiernan were about to start writing the ninth series and plan to do a third and final live show after that.\n\nOn 13 July 2018, the BBC announced that Still Game would return for the ninth and final series later in 2019, after which the show will end. Filming for the ninth series started in August 2018 and was completed on 14 September 2018.\n\nThe third and final SSE Hydro live show \"Still Game: The Final Farewell\" was officially announced on 1 November 2018, with five shows in September 2019 taking place over three days. A further 5 shows were announced on 2 November.\n\n\"Still Game\" is set in the fictional Craiglang area of Glasgow, and the Maryhill district of the city is a popular filming location. The early part of the first episode \"Flittin\" was filmed in the South Nitshill area of Glasgow, where Jack lived before he moved into the flat next-door to Victor at Osprey Heights. The block of flats which was used to film Osprey Heights can be found at Collina Street in the Maryhill area of Glasgow. The shops featured in the series can be found in the Townhead area of Glasgow. The Forth and Clyde Canal and its locks are used in background shots, along with the nearby high-rise tower blocks (flats) including the one used for Osprey Heights. For the first three series of the show, a pub (\"The Gimlet\") in Ruchill served as the set exterior of Jenny's pub, originally \"The Clansman\". Between series three and four, the building owner had it demolished. A reproduction exterior set was constructed by the production team in the Glasgow North Media Park, Maryhill for filming starting with the fourth series. An outdoor market in Possilpark was used in the episode \"Cauld\" when Winston buys several electric heaters. The bingo scene in \"Courtin\" was filmed at the Gala Bingo hall in Possilpark and was a scene that coincidentally brought two old friends together, as Paul Riley (Winston) and Joe Houston (the Gala Bingo caller featured in filming); were friends in their youth. Scene interiors (Jack and Victor's flats, hallways and the interior of Harrid's) were constructed sets in a warehouse of a complex now a Maryhill industrial estate and part of Craigmont Studios). Scenes from several episodes were also filmed in the Knightswood area of Glasgow, including exterior scenes in the episode \"Courtin\", and the golf course scenes in the episode \"Tappin\".\n\nFinport, as mentioned and seen in the fifth series, was filmed on location in Largs and Saltcoats, North Ayrshire, both of which were once popular seaside resorts with Glaswegians. The shots of the promenade and the sea wall is that of Saltcoats' harbour area. The café that Jack and Victor walk past is The Melbourne Café in Saltcoats. The pub scene is set in the Royal Oak pub in Largs, while the bed and breakfast where Jack and Victor stay overnight is located at the north end of Largs promenade. In the scene where Jack and Victor arrive on the bus from the right in Finport, this leads from the sea, as there is no road there. In the scene where Jack and Victor find Winston, a wide panning shot reveals the famous Nardini's ice-cream building and the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry to Millport.\n\nArdgowan House, a late eighteenth-century mansion at Inverkip, Inverclyde, was used as the setting for Blairtunnoch in the episode \"Fly Society\". Jack and Victor buy tickets for a meal and evening at the theatre from Tam who won them in a radio quiz. During the pre-theatre meal, they meet two apparently sophisticated, attractive ladies, played by Una McLean and Jeannie Fisher, whom they try to impress with tall tales of overseas adventures and wealth: the women thus invite them to a country house party at Blairtunnoch.\n\nThe area where Jack and Victor are sitting during the court recess in the episode \"Recipe\" of series six is the Main Lounge of The Crookston Hotel in Glasgow. The interior shots of the bakery in the same episode \"Recipe\" were filmed at factories in Glasgow, one of which Tunnocks factory in Uddingston (the baker at the start of this episode is also the Tunnocks baker in Uddingston) and also Pars Foods for the production line scene with Winston.The court scenes were filmed in Court No. 2 of Hamilton Sheriff Court.\n\nThe bar used during the Hogmanay Special in 2007, Hootenanny, was The Red Hoose in Dunipace, chosen by producers for its old world qualities.\n\nNavid's shop interior was a set in Hillington industrial estate, the exterior shots being a row of shops in Kennedy Path, Townhead, Glasgow.\n\nThe shots where Jack and Victor visit Barbara at her workplace were filmed in Clydebank, a town 8 miles west of Glasgow. The interior of the shop was also filmed on site in a local charity shop which is still in use today.\n\nJust before the fifth series started filming, a pest control team had to be called into the Maryhill studio set when it was discovered that rats had infested Navid's shop and were eating their way through the stock. The alarm was raised after Jane McCarry (Isa) found a dead rat on the set. The high rat population in the area was due to the proximity of the Forth and Clyde Canal.\n\nThe Children In Need sketch was filmed on the River City set at the BBC Scotland studios in Dumbarton, Scotland, as was much of the seventh series.\n\nThe theme music used on the TV broadcasts of the show is an excerpt from \"Cuban Boy\", as recorded by The Cuban Boys, which is itself based on a sample of Frank Chacksfield's track of the same name from the album \"West of Sunset\". The opening and ending theme tune was changed to an entirely different theme on the BBC DVD releases: the reason behind this is still unexplained, however licensing could be a possibility. The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra recorded an updated version of the theme tune for Series 7, which is also used on the DVD release of that series.\n\nReferring to the fifth series' finale, Scottish tabloid newspaper the \"Daily Record\" heralded for \"Still Game\" to be added to the ranks of the \"greatest sitcoms ever\". They called the episode \"classic comedy\" and said it was \"a perfect mix of empathetic friendship, laugh-out-loud gags, real feeling in the acting and genuine warmth and chemistry between the characters\". The Daily Record also reported that \"Still Game\" had higher ratings than rival comedies \"The Catherine Tate Show\" and Steve Coogan's \"Saxondale\" with 300,000 and 700,000 more viewers respectively. Creator and star Ford Kiernan said of the ratings: \"I am absolutely delighted. The figures have gradually increased – episode after episode.\"\n\n\"Still Game\" was criticised for its \"reliance on expletives\" by Teddy Jamieson, television critic for \"The Herald\". He also commented that the sitcom \"paints [Scotland] in broad strokes\", through its use of stereotypes. TV Today praised the show for being \"refreshing\" in the age of dying sitcoms. It said the show was funny in a \"straight down the line way\". \"Still Game\" has attracted interest from known screen legends, such as Sir Sean Connery (who even requested a role in the show). Actor Bill Nighy is also reported to be a fan, calling upon the distinct Glaswegian accent for his role as Davy Jones in \"Pirates of the Caribbean\". The show has won awards in both the 2004 and 2005 \"BAFTA Scotland\" awards and was named as the winner in the Best Broadcast category at the 2004 Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards.\n\nIn 2006, \"Still Game\" was once again nominated for a \"BAFTA Scotland\" award for the \"Most Popular Television\" category. Other contenders included \"Rebus\" and \"Taggart\". Paul Riley, who plays Winston, was also awarded for his role in the show.\n\nThe series revival in 2016 received some negative reviews. Julie McDowall, writing for \"The National\", said of the first episode \"You're going to hate me for saying this. I already hate myself for even daring to hold these thoughts, but I need to be honest with you: this was a disappointment.\" She later said of the series, \"I fear this once brilliant sitcom is turning into \"Mrs. Brown's Boys\". Just like an auld yin in The Clansman, its teeth have been removed and it’s gumsy and ineffectual and a bit of a bore.\" A review in \"Chortle\" said \"I suspect a lot of new viewers will wonder what all the fuss is about, as this episode seems clunky and dated,\" going on to say \"in truth no one here appears to be a great actor\" and that \"it seems to be a little crudely edited, too, with the timing of cutaways off the pace. And when you start to notice things like that, it’s got to be a sign that something’s wrong.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2085032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085032", "title": "Motril", "text": "Motril\n\nMotril () is a town and municipality on the Mediterranean coast in the province of Granada, Spain. It is the second largest town in the province, with a population of 60,368 as of 2016. The town is located near the Guadalfeo River and from Granada. The council of Motril includes the city of Motril and the neighbourhoods of El Varadero, Carchuna, Calahonda, Puntalón, Playa Granada, Las Ventillas, La Perla, La Garnatilla and La Chucha. The town is the capital of the region of the Coast of Granada.\n\nKing Baudouin of Belgium died in Motril of heart failure during a visit to his summer residence, \"Villa Astrida\" in 1993.\n\nAlthough its origin still remains unclear, it was a Phoenician enclave. It already existed in Roman times.\nWhen the Christians conquered Motril, there were 2,000 inhabitants whose main activities were agriculture, fishing and the production of silk and sugar. The city centre size was around . Outside the city there are two suburbs: Al-Majon suburb and al-Couruch suburb and a neighborhood called Jandara.\n\nThere was a Moorish uprising in 1569 that finished in 1570 with the Christians' victory.This made a recession of sugar production but this finished 5 years later with the repopulation of old Christians..reference to\n\nBy the end of 1600s, \"Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza\" church was built.\n\nSugar cane was the most important crop, which was later processed in the sugar refineries. The most important of these was \"La Casa de la Palma\". Now it's the place where the \"Museo Preindustrial de la Caña de Azúcar\" or Sugar Cane Museum is found.\n\nIn 1657, Philip IV granted Motril the title of city, separating its jurisdiction from Granada.\n\nAt the beginning of the next century, Philip V distinguished Motril as \"Muy Noble y Leal\" , which is now found on Motril's shield.\n\nAfter the War of Independence, in which Motril was occupied by French troops, the city started a new expansion of sugarcane and the sugar industry.\n\nIn the 19th century Motril participated in a singular event, it was proclaimed Independent Canton from July 22 to 25 of 1873.\nIn a few years, due to the increase in the number of sugar refineries, it went to the first position in the Granada industrial ranking. It opened to the public on most traditional ride in the city, \"Las Explanadas\", in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn 2011, the PP with Carlos Rojas got the mayoral service for a third time, with absolute majority. In 2012 he left his charge of mayor to be a spokesman of the \"Partido Popular Andaluz\", leaving the mayoral service to Luisa Garcia Chamorro.\n\nMotril is synonymous with sugar and sugar cane. The process from sugar cane transformation into various types of sugar, even liquors like the cherished rum of Motril, has always been the basis of the local economy. Sugar refineries were for many years the \"future\" of the city. Now they are one of Motril's legacies.\n\nSugar cane refineries in Motril are\n\nThis refinery is located next to the public swimming pool and the \"Parque de las Américas\".\nIt was founded by the Larios family in 1885, a family which founded a company based on the production of sugar and alcohol.\nAt present, the company makes gin.\n\nIn the past, many people lived thanks to the work of the refineries due to the sugar cane. Due to the low salaries, later, the workers burned the refinery. The sugar refinery will not be destroyed, as the Town Hall wanted, because it has been declared of historic heritage by the Andalusian Government. Also the chimney, store, distillery and the terrain are protected.\n\nLeaving Motril, towards Puntalón and La Garnatilla we find the sugar refinery of Nuestra Señora de las Angustias, dated 1868 and from which are restored some premises now intended for municipal usage, highlighting the magnificent \"Nave de los Arcos\". Juan Ramón La Chica owned two refineries called \"Nuestra Señora de las Angustias\", but one of them was in Granada and the other one in Motril. He gained full ownership over this last one in 1874. He also owned another sugar cane refinery called \"Nuestra Señora del Carmen\" in Pinos Puente (Granada).\n\n\nThis church is one of the most important and emblematic monuments in Motril. It is on a hill called Virgin's Hill. The church was built on the ruins of a nazari (Nasrid) fortress in the 17th century by the architect Isidro de la Chica. The building was damaged during the Civil War in the 20th century and it was restored by the sculptor Manuel Gonzales, a sculptor from Motril, in the 1960s. Inside the church is the patron saint of Motril, the Virgen de la Cabeza. Nowadays, the church is next to the Parque de los Pueblos de América and the first fountain built in Motril where there is a big Spanish flag.\n\nMotril has 61,171 inhabitants spread out over 110 km . There has been an increase of the population. Emigration was the first cause. Until 1610 there were 4,300 inhabitants. In 2012 there were 61,171 inhabitants. The population kept growing the last centuries.\n\nSituated in the south coast of Andalusia, Motril has main crops like avocado, custard apple, guava, mango and banana; as well as greenhouse cultivation and sugarcane (but 2006 was the last year in which sugarcane was cultivated).\n\nIn the ancient countryside of Motril was very important the sugarcane to the production of sugar, for that Motril have several sugar refineries such as:\n\nThese refineries are now abandoned. The potato was also very important.\n\nMotril and the villages of its the municipality: \"Carchuna\", \"Calahonda\", \"Castel de Ferro\" ... live of the crops in greenhouse. On one hand we have crops in greenhouse, the more importants are the tomatoes and the cucumbers. And on the other hand in a more reduced proportion crops outside such as custard apple, beans and peas.\n\nIts geographical position makes it a commercial and industrial centre. The most important industry in Motril is the paper mill that gives 400 jobs and produces around 250 tons of paper per year. \"The Port of Motril\" is a commercial and fishing port. Fishing is the second most important industry in Motril after the paper industry.\nThere is a museum in Motril, \"The Sugarcane Museum\" because, some years ago, there was a sugarcane refinery, where they extracted the sugar to sell it.\n\nThe climate in Motril is determined by two important geographic factors:\nThe set of both factors allows the presence of a subtropical microclimate. The annual average temperature is between 17 and 18 degrees Celsius. Summers are warm, between 25 and 30 degrees and winters are mild, with temperatures usually over 12 and 13 degrees.\n\nMotril's theater, named \"Teatro Calderón de la Barca\", organises many shows such as plays, exhibitions,concerts and monologues; and there is a local orchestra, the \"Joven Orquesta Ciudad de Motril\".\nIn Motril, there is a strong music development. Young people study several instruments at the professional conservatory and there is a local music school too. You can also find many small music bands created by Motrilians.\n\nFlamenco is also performed here in dance academies and exhibitions along the whole year, specially in the Cruces. Flamenco is the most characteristic dance style but other style are also practised, like ballet.\n\nYouth Area proposes many activities organised by local associations to contribute to the city's leisure like video games tournaments, crafts workshops and once a year, an event called \"Encuentro Joven\" where young people and children meet and these association prepares games to pass a journey all together and meet new people. This area has a centre called the \"Centro Joven\" where expositions of young local artists draws are passed so it helps to get to know their work.\nThe Holy week in Motril has been declared \"National Tourist Interest\", It consist of 12 brotherhood, 23 \"pasos\" and more than 6000 followers. There are processions every day.\nThe \"Holy week\" in Motril started in 1600 with the eldest brotherhood, called \"Vera Cruz\". After the civil war every brotherhood had to restore its patrimony.\n\nAlmost all the statues in Motril are made by some artists from the province of Granada.\nThe most interesting processions are:\n\n-The starting procession is on Palm Sunday. In this procession we can see two different pasos, it is so interesting because there is a lot of people that accompany it with palm.\n\n-On Easter Sunday there is a procession called \"Dulce Nombre de Jesus\", it is really special. It consists on a group of children carrying the statue. It is accompanied by a lot of little children carrying bells.\n\nNowadays, the members of the brotherhood accompany the image with special clothes that cover their face.\n\nIn Spain there is a tradition of not to eat meat on Holy Thursday and on Good Friday.\nEach city has their own stew. The typical menu in Motril is the stew made with chickpeas and cod, the cod with tomato, and some cod omelette. Also, there are different desserts like rice pudding, torrija ... In these days it's common meeting the family.\n\nThe most popular dish from Motril is \"migas\" (crumbs), made of bread. Fish is also very popular in Motril, due the town's important fisheries. The most popular fish are anchovy (locally named \"boquerón\"), sardines and shrimp. The most famous drink, exclusive to the area, is \"ron pálido\" which is a locally produced rum.\n\nMotril is a growing dynamic city, a place of service where visitors feel at home, thanks to the great hospitality of its people.\nYou can visit many places to have fun and meet new people, for example:\n\n-Paseo de las explanadas: pubs normally open from 4 pm until 4 am.\n\n-Parque de los Pueblos de América: The main feature of this park is great variety of tropical flora to be found in it.\n\nMotril is within the Costa Tropical, a large tourist region on the coast. Motril has small beaches (bays) and large beaches (like Playa Granada). They are popular during the summer with people from the surrounding as well as the interior regions. The main problems are the wind and the jellyfish.\n\nBeaches in the area include Playa de Poniente (a large gravel/shingle beach), Playa Granada (shingles), Playa Carchuna (gravel and pebbles), and Playa Calahonda (gravel). Many of the area's beaches include car parking facilities, first aid stands, showers, beach cleaning, bars and restaurants, typical beach facilities (such as beach umbrellas and hammocks) and S.O.S. telephones.\n\nMotril is served by autovías A-7 to Málaga and Almería, and A-44 to Granada. The Port of Motril offers ferries to Melilla, and shipped 2.8 million tonnes of cargo in 2019. Motril is the only Spanish Mediterranean port that lacks a rail service; building a line which would take 25 minutes to travel to Granada railway station was estimated to cost €400 million in 2017. In 2019, political party Vox announced its support for a rail link.\n\nOn July 22, 2008, a second time capsule in Spain was buried as part of an official event organized to commemorate the 135th anniversary of the cantonal movement in Motril, which began on July 22, 1873, and ended on 25 March. The president of the canton was Ruperto Vidaurreta de la Camara. This time capsule will be opened on July 22, 2023, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of this event. It is located at coordinates \n\n\nIts story is particularly tragic: On 13 January 1804 there was a very strong earthquake which had devastating effects: it caused the partial destruction of the city and the death of two people. Currently it recalls a vote conducted by the neighborhood because of the misfortunes suffered by hundreds of families during these disastrous years.\n\n\nThis day, Andalusia's flag is hoisted at Puchilla's roundabout and the Andalusian anthem is sung. On this day there are numerous acts of civil and military authorities. A popular race is also celebrated in which the runners go from the square of the \"Explanadas\" to the fire station in the port. After this race there are numerous sports-related activities.\n\n\nMotril is considered the second most famous city of \"Las Cruces\", after Córdoba. It's an important festivity considered National Tourist Interest. During the three days of celebration there are several types of singing and dancing shows. There are carriages decorated with traditional objects of the popular culture around the town and in some special squares neighbours make big crosses decorated with flowers. The most typical clothing for this day is the flamenco outfit.\n\n\nBonfires are lit on the beach, and people are allowed to camp, there is a tradition by which you throw three wishes written on a piece of paper into the fire and throw three negatives ideas into the sea for the tide to take them.\n\n\nIt is celebrated on 13 June and it is celebrated in the north of Motril, in the neighbourhood where there is the old chapel of the Saint. The neighbourhood helps with the organization of this event.\n\n\nThese are the festivities of the neighbourhood \"El Varadero\", on Motril's port. There, a mass in the \"Lonja Pesquera\" is celebrated and fishermen sing a \"Salve Mariner\". At sunset, after a procession in the streets, the virgin is boarded and leaves from the port followed by all the fleet, decorated for the events. In this festivity show fireworks.\n\n\nIn the first half of August the patronal festivities of Motril in honour of the \"Virgen de la Cabeza\" are celebrated. On these weeks, different events are celebrated in the \"Ferial del Cortijo del Conde\", with some concerts, night fair, dances, sport shows, fireworks with music on the beach, morning fair ... On the 15th, the Virgin goes through the city streets.\n\nThese two popular neighbourhoods of Motril celebrate their patronal celebrations during the month of October. Both the \"Virgen de Las Angustias\" and the \" Virgen de la Pastora\" leave their churches and they go all over the neighbourhoods with the fervour of their neighbours.\n\n\nThe town has a football team, Motril CF.\n\n\n"}

It has a population of about 100, including Foolow , Grindlow plus Little Hucklow and being measured at 427 in the 2011 Census. The area is now mainly agricultural, but the village was formerly a centre of the Derbyshire lead mining industry. The lead vein or rake outcrops to the surface to the west of the village and dives under the rocks of Hucklow Edge on the western side of the village where an adit, known as Milldam Mine, has recently been reopened by Glebe Mines Ltd that connects the various deep mines that had formerly been dug along the edge. This mine is being worked for fluorspar, which is frequently found associated with lead in the vein.\n\nIn the village, there is a thriving primary school, which is located up a short lane (School Lane), under the edge, and a pub, the Queen Anne.\n\nIt had a theatre for 40 years, which was run by L. du Garde Peach and the actors and staff were from the local area. The first production (The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare) was in 1927 staged in the Hucklow Holiday Homes. The first set of plays in the New Play House was in 1938, with four one act plays written by Peach. The New Play House was in a converted lead mining building (known locally as cupolas from the lead smelting furnace). The first 200-second hand seats cost 1 shilling and 9 pence each. The stage was wide by deep. For many years the theatre brought many visitors to Great Hucklow from all parts of the north of England. The theatre building is still used as an activity centre.\n\nThe Unitarian Old Chapel was founded in 1696 and is still in use; it also has a small meeting room which is well used by the community. The Methodist Chapel, built in the early part of the 19th century, was converted to offices in 1999.\n\nThe Nightingale Centre, which belongs to the Unitarians, is in the middle of the village and accommodates groups for school and community visits to the area, conferences and provides country holidays for children from inner cities. The Centre brings many visitors to the village from all over the world.\n\nRecently, Great Hucklow has taken control of the Silance Mine Heritage Site, jointly with the village of Foolow. This is a four hectare area of scrub, woodland and grassland on a south facing slope on Hucklow Edge which was the previous location for lead working at both Silence and Old Grove Mine and more recent re-working of the surface mineral heaps for fluorspar. The site straddles the parish boundary between Grindlow to the west and Foolow to the east. It is positioned on the boundary between the White and Dark Peak character areas. The long history of mining has resulted in the development of very complex surface soils with those derived from the shales lying in intimate association with soils developing from limestone and mineral material brought to the surface during the mining operations. Both Silence and Old Grove Mines have been extensively reworked for fluorspar at surface, but at the top end of Silence Mine there are the previously unrecognised remains of steam engine buildings and associated structures. These include the back walls of a horizontal engine house and boiler house, the possible base of a chimney, and a small sunken ‘chamber’ that originally was one half of a wheel pit which contained a large flywheel and/or winding drum associated with the engine house. Hillocks remain in the northern part of Old Grove Mine. The Peak District Mines Historical Society are currently excavating the remains of Silance Mine.\n\nThe village is twinned with Parisot, Tarn-et-Garonne which is a rural village of similar size in the south west of France.\n\nThe land rises steeply to the north of the village to Hucklow Edge and at Camphill on the plateau above it there is a popular gliding field, operated by the Derbyshire and Lancashire Gliding Club, which in July 1954 hosted the World Gliding Championships. On 9 August 2011 the UK's longest paraglider flight began in the village, ending over 250 km away in Suffolk.\n\nThe village is accessed from the B6049 about a mile north of where it crosses the A623 at the Anchor Inn. The road to the village goes off to the east at the Windmill triangle.\n\nThe village is host to an annual martial arts residency; this is a tradition dates back almost 30 years.\n\n"}

His parents, Samuel and Margaret sent him to school, although he could already read fluently by the age of four. He initially got a job keeping accounts locally but then went to apprentice as a courier in Chesterfield at the age of fourteen. He was able to extend his linguistic skills by learning French from prisoners of war. He learnt maths and music and at age of seventeen he was a Wesleyan preacher.\n\nFour years later he walked to London, and enlisted as a soldier. He did not, however, give up preaching. At the request of Dr. Adam Clarke, he spoke at the City Road Chapel. After a year he returned to Derbyshire. He separated from the Methodists about this time because he wrote a patriotic song which was sung in a public-house. In 1813 he started business at Eyam as a currier, but trade was neglected for music, poetry, and mathematics.\n\nHis prospects were not improved when in 1816 he ran away with and married Frances Ibbotson of Hathersage. In 1821 he became schoolmaster in the free school at Dore which was then in Derbyshire. He also acted as vestry and parish clerk, but showed his independence of mind and action by invariably closing his book and resuming his seat at the recitation of the Athanasian Creed. He practised medicine and surgery, and when the ancient chapel of Dore was pulled down, his plans for a new one were adopted. He only superintended the erection of the building, but carved the ornamented figures which adorn the structure. On a change of incumbent at Dore he retired from his office of schoolmaster on a pension of £15. The only duties he had now to perform were those of district registrar, which yielded him twelve pounds a year. In no year of his life did his income exceed eighty pounds.\n\nHis first publication was a satirical poem entitled the ‘Rag Bag,’ 1832. His next was ‘Medicus-Magus, a poem, in three cantos,’ Sheffield, 1836, 12mo, in which he depicted the manners, habits, and limited intelligence, in the more remote parts of Derbyshire, the local terms being elucidated by a glossary. The title was afterwards altered to ‘The Astrologer.’ Many of his miscellaneous poems were printed in the ‘Sheffield Iris.’ After his death a collected edition of his ‘Poetical Works,’ with a sketch of his life by Dr. G. Calvert Holland, was published (Sheffield, 1858, 8vo). His verse is antiquated but forcible. One of his short pieces, the ‘Old Year's Funeral,’ was thought by James Montgomery to be worthy of comparison with Coleridge's ode ‘On the Departing Year.’\n\nHis wife died in 1844, and in 1850 he took as a second wife, Mary, widow of John Lunn of Staveley, Derbyshire. He died on 13 Dec. 1857, and was buried at Eyam church.\n\n"}
{"id": "2085068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085068", "title": "Gödel metric", "text": "Gödel metric\n\nThe Gödel metric is an exact solution of the Einstein field equations in which the stress–energy tensor contains two terms, the first representing the matter density of a homogeneous distribution of swirling dust particles (dust solution), and the second associated with a nonzero cosmological constant (see lambdavacuum solution). It is also known as the Gödel solution or Gödel universe.\n\nThis solution has many unusual properties—in particular, the existence of closed timelike curves that would allow time travel in a universe described by the solution. Its definition is somewhat artificial in that the value of the cosmological constant must be carefully chosen to match the density of the dust grains, but this spacetime is an important pedagogical example.\n\nThe solution was found in 1949 by Kurt Gödel.\n\nLike any other Lorentzian spacetime, the Gödel solution presents the metric tensor in terms of some local coordinate chart. It may be easiest to understand the Gödel universe using the cylindrical coordinate system (presented below), but this article uses the chart that Gödel originally used. In this chart, the metric (or equivalently the line element) is\nwhere formula_2 is a nonzero real constant, which turns out to be the angular velocity of the surrounding dust grains around the \"y\" axis, as measured by a \"non-spinning\" observer riding one of the dust grains. \"Non-spinning\" means that it doesn't feel centrifugal forces, but in this coordinate frame it would actually be turning on an axis parallel to the \"y\" axis. As we shall see, the dust grains stay at constant values of \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\". Their density in this coordinate chart increases with \"x\", but their density in their own frames of reference is the same everywhere.\n\nTo study the properties of the Gödel solution, we will adopt the frame field (dual to the coframe read off the metric as given above),\nThis frame defines a family of inertial observers who are \"comoving with the dust grains\". However, computing the Fermi–Walker derivatives with respect to formula_7 shows that the spatial frames are \"spinning\" about formula_8 with angular velocity formula_9. It follows that the \"nonspinning inertial frame\" comoving with the dust particles is\n\nThe components of the Einstein tensor (with respect to either frame above) are\nHere, the first term is characteristic of a lambdavacuum solution and the second term is characteristic of a pressureless perfect fluid or dust solution. Notice that the cosmological constant is carefully chosen to partially cancel the matter density of the dust.\n\nThe Gödel spacetime is a rare example of a \"regular\" (singularity-free) solution of the Einstein field equation. Gödel's original chart (given here) is geodesically complete and singularity free; therefore, it is a global chart, and the spacetime is homeomorphic to R, and therefore, simply connected.\n\nIn any Lorentzian spacetime, the fourth-rank Riemann tensor is a multilinear operator on the four-dimensional space of tangent vectors (at some event), but a linear operator on the six-dimensional space of bivectors at that event. Accordingly, it has a characteristic polynomial, whose roots are the eigenvalues. In the Gödel spacetime, these eigenvalues are very simple:\n\nThis spacetime admits a five-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing vectors, which can be generated by \"time translation\" formula_17, two \"spatial translations\" formula_18, plus two further Killing vector fields:\nand\nThe isometry group acts \"transitively\" (since we can translate in formula_21, and using the fourth vector we can move along formula_22 as well), so the spacetime is \"homogeneous\". However, it is not \"isotropic\", as we shall see.\n\nIt is obvious from the generators just given that the slices formula_23 admit a transitive abelian three-dimensional transformation group, so a quotient of the solution can be reinterpreted as a stationary cylindrically symmetric solution. Less obviously, the slices formula_24 admit an SL(2,R) action, and the slices formula_25 admit a Bianchi III (c.f. the fourth Killing vector field). We can restate this by saying that our symmetry group includes as three-dimensional subgroups examples of Bianchi types I, III and VIII. Four of the five Killing vectors, as well as the curvature tensor, do not depend upon the coordinate y. Indeed, the Gödel solution is the Cartesian product of a factor R with a three-dimensional Lorentzian manifold (signature −++).\n\nIt can be shown that the Gödel solution is, up to local isometry, the \"only\" perfect fluid solution of the Einstein field equation admitting a five-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing vectors.\n\nThe Weyl tensor of the Gödel solution has Petrov type D. This means that for an appropriately chosen observer, the tidal forces have \"Coulomb form\".\n\nTo study the tidal forces in more detail, we compute the Bel decomposition of the Riemann tensor into three pieces, the tidal or electrogravitic tensor (which represents tidal forces), the magnetogravitic tensor (which represents spin-spin forces on spinning test particles and other gravitational effects analogous to magnetism), and the topogravitic tensor (which represents the spatial sectional curvatures).\n\nObservers comoving with the dust particles find that the \"tidal tensor\" (with respect to formula_26, which components evaluated in our frame) has the form\nThat is, they measure isotropic tidal tension orthogonal to the distinguished direction formula_28.\n\nThe gravitomagnetic tensor \"vanishes identically\"\nThis is an artifact of the unusual symmetries of this spacetime, and implies that the putative \"rotation\" of the dust does not have the gravitomagnetic effects usually associated with the gravitational field produced by rotating matter.\n\nThe principal Lorentz invariants of the Riemann tensor are\nThis gives the conditions\nPlugging these into the Einstein tensor, we see that in fact we now have formula_32. The simplest nontrivial spacetime we can construct in this way evidently would have this coefficient be some nonzero but \"constant\" function of the radial coordinate. Specifically, with a bit of foresight, let us choose formula_33. This gives\nFinally, let us demand that this frame satisfy\nThis gives formula_36, and our frame becomes\n\nFrom the metric tensor we find that the vector field formula_38, which is \"spacelike\" for small radii, becomes \"null\" at formula_39 where\nThis is because at that radius we find that formula_41 so formula_42 and is therefore null. The circle formula_43 at a given \"t\" is a closed null curve, but not a null geodesic.\n\nExamining the frame above, we can see that the coordinate formula_44 is inessential; our spacetime is the direct product of a factor R with a signature −++ three-manifold. Suppressing formula_44 in order to focus our attention on this three-manifold, let us examine how the appearance of the light cones changes as we travel out from the axis of symmetry formula_46:\n\nWhen we get to the critical radius, the cones become tangent to the closed null curve.\n\nAt the critical radius formula_43, the vector field formula_38 becomes null. For larger radii, it is \"timelike\". Thus, corresponding to our symmetry axis we have a timelike congruence made up of \"circles\" and corresponding to certain observers. This congruence is however \"only defined outside the cylinder\" formula_39.\n\nThis is not a geodesic congruence; rather, each observer in this family must maintain a \"constant acceleration\" in order to hold his course. Observers with smaller radii must accelerate harder; as formula_50 the magnitude of acceleration diverges, which is just what is expected, given that formula_39 is a null curve.\n\nIf we examine the past light cone of an event on the axis of symmetry, we find the following picture:\n\nRecall that vertical coordinate lines in our chart represent the world lines of the dust particles, but \"despite their straight appearance in our chart\", the congruence formed by these curves has nonzero vorticity, so the world lines are actually \"twisting about each other\". The fact that the null geodesics spiral inwards in the manner shown above means that when our observer looks \"radially outwards\", he sees nearby dust particles, not at their current locations, but at their earlier locations. This is just what we would expect if the dust particles are in fact rotating about one another.\n\nThe null geodesics are \"geometrically straight\"; in the figure, they appear to be spirals only because the coordinates are \"rotating\" in order to permit the dust particles to appear stationary.\n\nAccording to Hawking and Ellis (see monograph cited below), all light rays emitted from an event on the symmetry axis reconverge at a later event on the axis, with the null geodesics forming a circular cusp (which is a null curve, but not a null geodesic):\n\nThis implies that in the Gödel lambdadust solution, the absolute future of each event has a character very different from what we might naively expect.\n\nFollowing Gödel, we can interpret the dust particles as galaxies, so that the Gödel solution becomes a \"cosmological model of a rotating universe\". Besides rotating, this model exhibits no Hubble expansion, so it is not a realistic model of the universe in which we live, but can be taken as illustrating an alternative universe, which would in principle be allowed by general relativity (if one admits the legitimacy of a nonzero cosmological constant). Less well known solutions of Gödel's exhibit both rotation and Hubble expansion and have other qualities of his first model, but travelling into the past is not possible. According to S. W. Hawking, \"these models could well be a reasonable description of the universe that we observe\", however observational data are compatible only with a very low rate of rotation. The quality of these observations improved continually up until Gödel's death, and he would always ask \"is the universe rotating yet?\" and be told \"no, it isn't\".\n\nWe have seen that observers lying on the \"y\" axis (in the original chart) see the rest of the universe rotating clockwise about that axis. However, the homogeneity of the spacetime shows that the \"direction\" but not the \"position\" of this \"axis\" is distinguished.\n\nSome have interpreted the Gödel universe as a counterexample to Einstein's hopes that general relativity should exhibit some kind of Mach's principle, citing the fact that the matter is rotating (world lines twisting about each other) in a manner sufficient to pick out a preferred direction, although with no distinguished axis of rotation.\n\nOthers take \"Mach principle\" to mean some physical law tying the definition of nonspinning inertial frames at each event to the global distribution and motion of matter everywhere in the universe, and say that because the nonspinning inertial frames are precisely tied to the rotation of the dust in just the way such a Mach principle would suggest, this model \"does\" accord with Mach's ideas.\n\nMany other exact solutions that can be interpreted as cosmological models of rotating universes are known. See the book \"Homogeneous Relativistic Cosmologies\" (1975) by Ryan and Shepley for some of these generalizations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2085073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085073", "title": "Primacy of Peter", "text": "Primacy of Peter\n\nThe primacy of Peter, also known as Petrine primacy (from Latin: \"Petrus\", \"Peter\"), is the position of preeminence that is attributed to Saint Peter among the Twelve Apostles.\n\nIt is to be distinguished from but forms the basis of the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, also known as papal primacy or Roman primacy.\n\nThe \"Evangelical Dictionary of Theology\" illustrates the leading role that Peter played among the Apostles, speaking up on matters that concern them all, being called by Jesus by a name linking him with the rock on which Jesus would build his church, being charged with pastoring the flock of Christ, and taking the leading role in the initial church as described in the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nThere is general agreement among scholars on the preeminence that the historical Peter held among the disciples of Jesus, making him \"the most prominent and influential member of the Twelve during Jesus' ministry and in the early Church\".\n\nIn one interpretation the prominence that the New Testament and other early Christian writings attribute to Peter is due to their seeing him as a unifying factor in contrast to other figures identified with disputed interpretations of Christianity.\n\nControversy has surrounded one particular text that is linked with the Aramaic nickname name כפא (\"Cepha\"), meaning \"rock,\" that Jesus gave the man previously known as Simon. The Greeks translated it as Πέτρος (\"Petros\"), a new form, appropriately masculine, of the standard feminine word πέτρα (\"petra\"), also meaning \"rock;\" and the Latins translated it as \"Petrus\".\n\nWhile the reasons for disagreement on the nature of the primacy are complex, hinging on matters of doctrine, history and politics, the debate is often reduced to a discussion of the meaning and translation of Matthew 16:18: \"And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" \n\nIn the Greek text, the new name given is Πέτρος (\"Petros\"), and in the second half of the same verse the word translated as \"rock\" is πέτρα (\"petra\"). A literal translation, in the style of the King James Version, of the words presumably used by Jesus would be \"Thou art Rock, and upon this rock will I build my church\". To preserve a supposed pun, the Greek text chose to translate Peter's name as \"Πέτρος\" rather than as \"Κηφᾶς\" (Cephas).\n\nOne common Protestant argument historically has been that the translation from the New Testament in Hebrew into Greek is tenuous at best as there is no real evidence or indication that the New Testament (in Greek) was ever translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts; for that argument see Aramaic primacy. According to the Protestant transliteration argument, in the language that Jesus spoke, the same word, כפא (cepha), was used for both Peter's name and for the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church. Since the Protestant Reformation, many non-Catholics, in disagreement with the historic Catholic Church view, have disputed whether the feminine πέτρα refers to Peter, claiming it instead refers to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.\n\nIn Catholicism, it is argued that the primacy of Peter is a basis for the primacy of the bishop of Rome over other bishops throughout the Church. This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the papacy has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the entire Church. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and passed on. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of pope which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Protestants do not believe the pope holds any authority over the universal Church.\n\nSome Catholics believe that Saint Paul saw Judaism as the type or figure of Christianity: \"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure...\" In the Old Law, attributes to the High Priest the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic suggests that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church, though the relevance of Biblical law in Christianity is still disputed; see also New Covenant and New Commandment. Furthermore, it is typically the local bishop who is considered the high priest of his flock, rather than the pope alone.\n\nIn the New Testament, which some call the \"New Law\" or \"New Greek Testament\", reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul).\n\nJesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \"I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the Book of Revelation, that He has the \"keys of death and hell,\" which means that He has power over death and hell; also supports this. Cardinal Gibbons, in his book \"The Faith of Our Fathers\", points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence. In receiving the keys, Peter takes on the office of prime minister, which was well-known to ancient and contemporary Hebrews, and depicted in the Old Testament, as the one who had authority from the King to bind and loose.\n\nAnother source indicating Peter's supremacy can be found in where Christ tells Peter three times to \"feed His sheep\" and \"feed His lambs.\" The \"sheep\" might be understood to be the stronger portion of Jesus' flock (the clergy), and the \"lambs\" as the weaker portion (the laity). From this, Catholics believe that Peter was given charge over Christ's whole flock, that is, the Church.\n\nMoreover, Peter is always named first in all listings of the Apostles; Judas is invariably mentioned last. In Peter is described as the \"first Apostle\". It is important to note that Peter was neither the first Apostle in age nor election; therefore, Peter must be the first Apostle in the sense of authority, if one ignores the possibility of him being first in the sense of first in the list of Twelve Apostles. According to , St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. Jesus also instructed St. Peter to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles, according to .\n\nBoth Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. John Chrysostom) referred to \"rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.\n\nVatican Council I defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint. At the same time, the history of papal primacy has always been imperfect and much-debated. This is reflected in the Catechism of the Catholic Church:\n\nRegarding the Catholic interpretation of Matthew 16:18-19, Jaroslav Pelikan writes: \"As Roman Catholic scholars now concede, the ancient Christian father Cyprian used it to prove the authority of the bishop—not merely of the Roman bishop, but of every bishop,\" referring to Maurice Bevenot's work on St. Cyprian.\n\nEastern Catholics agree with the above, but also consider Peter to be representative of all bishops. In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the Eastern Orthodox in the next section.\n\nThough among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of Acts of the Apostles, James \"the brother of the Lord\" is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first Bishop of Jerusalem. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the Council of Jerusalem and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as circumcision) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \"pillars of the church\" in Jerusalem. James was indeed the first bishop or patriarch of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \"Rock\" and \"Chief Shepherd\". It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to Herod Agrippa's persecution. \n\nHowever, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek \"exegesato\" to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \"declaring\" or \"issuing a ruling.\" However, James uses the Greek word \"akouoo\" in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \"giving one's opinion,\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his \"Saint Peter and the Popes\" in the following terms: \"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\"\n\nThe Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed,\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem, and again, \"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\" \n\nThis view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople:\n\nFor Catholics, the fact that the new name for Simon is Peter is in fact itself very significant. In the Old Testament God is frequently referred to as a Rock or stone. Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone. The Book of Daniel contains a prophecy that a Rock or stone from the mountain of God (heaven) will come down to earth and destroy the pagan kings. The rock will then grow itself until it covers the entire earth. Protestants consider this prophecy to allude to the end times but Catholics consider the prophecy to refer specifically to Jesus as the Rock from Heaven. Further, Catholics see the fact that the Rock does not leave but stays to until it covers the entire earth to mean that the Church, built of the Rock of Peter, is the body of Christ, the Rock from Heaven, and that the Rock will eventually cover the entire Earth which is why the term Catholic (universal or worldwide) is the most common designation for the Catholic Church.\n\nIrenaeus has been called the most important witness of the Christianity of the 2nd century. Taught by Polycarp, who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became Bishop of Lyon in 178. In his \"Against the Heresies\", Irenaeus wrote, \"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world.\" In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way … gather more than they ought.\"\n\nIrenaeus asserted the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession to counter the claims of heretics, especially the Gnostics who were attacking the theology and authority of the mainstream Church. He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans.\n\nIgnatius, bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at Smyrna in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church.\"\n\nBorn in Carthage around 155 AD, Tertullian became a priest around the age of forty and worked tirelessly to defend the faith. In his \"Scorpiace\" of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold. …For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\" \"Scorpiace\" is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \"everyone\" if they \"made confession\", rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia, listing various reasons why the Keys of Peter pertained to Peter alone. The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power.\n\nThascius Caecilius Cyprianus was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\" In his 251 AD \"De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate\", Cyprian asks, \"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\"\n\nJohn Chrysostom was born at Antioch around 347 and would fight for the reform of the Church until his exile in 404. His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy. He called Peter \"the leader of the choir, the mouth of all the apostles, the head of that tribe, the ruler of the whole world, the foundation of the Church, the ardent lover of Christ.\" His writings also emphasize the mortality of Peter, linking him more closely to the people of the Church.\n\nSaint Augustine was born in Numidia in 354 AD and was baptized in Milan in 387 AD. He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church. His \"Sermo\" states, \"Peter in many places in the Scriptures appears to represent the Church, especially in that place where it was said 'I give to thee the keys … shall be loosed in heaven'. What! did Peter receive these keys, and Paul not receive? Did Peter receive and John and James not receive, and the rest of the apostles? But since in a figure Peter represented the Church, what was given to him singly was given to the Church.\" His 395 A.D. \"Contra Epistolam Manichaei\" states, \"There are many other things which rightly keep me in the bosom of the Catholic Church. …The succession of the priests keeps me, from the very seat of the apostle Peter (to whom the Lord after his resurrection gave charge to feed his sheep) down to the present episcopate.\"\n\nInnocent I held the papal office from 402 to 417. Modern theories of papal primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to Decentius, bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\" It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes to the authority of \"his holiness\" drawn from the authority of Scripture. The doctrine of primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy.\n\nBased on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that Leo I identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted to but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter. …So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles.\" The Council of Chalcedon would later refer to Leo as \"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\"\n\nThe Gregorian Reform movement was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by Gregory VII, formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general. Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and King Henry IV of Germany, known as the \"Investiture Contest\". Gregory's \"Dictus Pape\" outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops. This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\" The Petrine primacy was now more affirmed than ever.\n\nMany challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The Edict of Milan, the Council of Nicea, and the First Council of Constantinople all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The Council of Ephesus in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD). Although the highlight of the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD was the confession of the Person of Christ, the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops. Many letters of the Council identify its position as in agreement with papal primacy. Those present employ titles such as \"the most holy and beloved of God\" and \"ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome\" to address Pope Leo. Thus, as not all can be satisfied with the results, the Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism with the Oriental Orthodox Church.\n\nInternally, people questioned who rightfully was pope, while others wondered as to the role the pope was to play outside of Rome. The papacy's most widely known crisis, as well as its largest challenge to authority, came with the \"Western Schism\" in the late Middle Ages, dating from 1378–1417. Seven popes ruled from Avignon in France in the early 14th century, until Gregory XI risked returning to turbulent Italy and the Roman seat. Following the close of the Avignon papacy in 1377, Urban VI, an Italian, took the reins over a predominantly French college of Cardinals. The Cardinals called the election into question and elected Clement VII as Pope. Germany, Italy, England, and the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe remained loyal to Urban, while France, Spain, Scotland, and Rome followed Clement VII (1378–1394) and his successor, Benedict XIII (1394–1417) who would reside in Avignon.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church regards the Apostle Peter, together with the Apostle Paul, as \"preeminent apostles\". Another title used for Peter is \"Coryphaeus\", which could be translated as \"Choir-director,\" or lead singer.\n\nOrthodox scholars follow St. John Chrysostom and the Byzantine tradition in seeing Peter as the icon of the episcopate with his title of protos (first) implying a certain level of authority over the other apostles. In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\"the diocese\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \"Chair of Peter\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair.\n\nAs John Meyendorff explained:\n\nThe notion that many Sees were ‘’of Peter’’ had also once been held in the West. We hear from Pope Gregory the Great:\n\nConsequently, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the unique successor of St. Peter and consider him to be in a state of schism and heresy. However, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul.\n\nThe Orthodox also consider that St. Linus, not Peter, was actually the first Bishop of Rome.\nEastern Orthodox theologians agree that in , \"rock\" is a likely reference to Peter personally since the very name \"Peter\" means \"rock.\". However implies that the other Apostles were given the same powers. Although the word \"keys\" is \"explicitly\" absent from this later verse a number of Church Fathers recognised that the meaning of \"keys\" is \"implicitly\" there; that the rest of the church has the keys:\n\nTertullian\nHilary of Poitiers\nJohn Chrysostom\nAugustine\n\nMoreover, Eastern Orthodox theologians follow such Fathers as St. John Chrysostom by clarifying that \"rock\" simultaneously refers to Peter (instrumentally) as well as Peter's confession of faith which is what has ultimate significance in establishing the Church.\n\nSome Orthodox scholars do not see Peter as being in any way above the other apostles, arguing that Peter did not have power and authority over them during Christ's public ministry. There were no positions of power between the twelve, only \"degrees of intimacy\" or \"degrees of honor.\" According to this view, Peter has a weak symbolic primacy or primacy of honor (in the sense of a purely honorary primacy). In the patristic era, this was actually the Western view held by St Augustine. Others (see above), following the traditional Byzantine view of St John Chrysostom see Peter as the icon of the bishop and therefore endowed with authority in the Church (i.e. the diocese).\n\nTertullian\n\nJohn Chrysostom\nPope Leo I\nOther biblical texts seem to suggest that Peter was not \"head of the church\" in any \"de jure\" sense. shows the apostles considering a question by means of calling a Council. Although Peter is mentioned as speaking first, and all are silent – all are silent too when Paul speaks. Further, if Peter's pronouncement was authoritative then Paul speaking afterwards would be superfluous; given that the \"decision\" had already been made.\n\nEquality of all the Apostles is shown in ; that all the Apostles together are the foundation of the church.\n\nThe \"forgiveness of sins\" (one of the powers of \"the keys\") is granted to many; see and .\n\nOrthodox historians also maintain that Rome's authority in the early Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) empire was recognized only partially because of Rome's Petrine character, and that this factor was not the decisive issue. Moreover, the Orthodox view is that Rome's privileges were not understood as an absolute power (i.e., the difference between primacy and supremacy). In the East, there were numerous \"apostolic sees\", Jerusalem being considered the \"mother of all churches\", and the bishop of Antioch could also claim the title of successor to Peter, being that Peter was the first bishop of Antioch. \"Canon 28 of Chalcedon was for [the Byzantines] one of the essential texts for the organization of the Church: 'It is for right reasons that accorded privileges to old Rome, for this city was the seat of the Emperor and the Senate.' ...The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\"\n\nA major debate between Catholics and Protestants centers on Matthew 16:18 where Jesus tells Peter: \"You are \"Peter\", and on this \"rock\" I will build my Church.\" Catholics interpret the verse as saying that Jesus would build his church on Peter, the apostle: Jesus told Peter (Rock) that he would build his Church on this Rock (Peter), and that Peter was made the shepherd of the apostolic flock – hence their assertion of the Primacy of the Catholic Pontiff.\n\nOne Protestant view on the Matthew verse agrees with the Catholic view and again the disagreements about primacy stem from doctrinal sources, and disagreements such as those over the identification of Simon Peter with the Pope. Other Protestants assert the following, based specifically on the verse in Matthew:\n\nJesus gives Simon the new name \"petros\". However he refers to the \"rock\" as \"petra\". The inspired New Testament Scriptures were written in Greek, not Aramaic. What Jesus \"might\" have said in Aramaic is conjecture. In Greek, there is a distinction between the two words, πέτρα being a \"rock\" but πέτρος being a \"small stone\" or \"pebble\". (James G. McCarthy translates the two as \"mass of rock\" and \"boulder or detached stone\", respectively.) Jesus is not referring to Peter when talking about \"this rock\", but is in fact referring to Peter's confession of faith in the preceding verses. Jesus thus does not declare the primacy of Peter, but rather declares that his church will be built upon the foundation of the revelation of and confession of faith of Jesus as the Christ.\n\nMany Protestant scholars, however, reject this position, such as Craig L. Blomberg who states, \"The expression ‘this rock’ almost certainly refers to Peter, following immediately after his name, just as the words following ‘the Christ’ in verse 16 applied to Jesus. The play on words in the Greek between Peter's name (Petros) and the word ‘rock’ (petra) makes sense only if Peter is the Rock and if Jesus is about to explain the significance of this identification\" (New American Commentary: ).\n\nDonald A. Carson III (Baptist and Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Seminary) states:\nAn alternate Protestant argument is that when Jesus said \"upon this rock\" in the aforementioned Matthew verse, he referred to himself, in reference to , which states that \"God ... is the Rock, his work is perfect\". This idea also appears in , which says \"...that Rock is Christ.\" In , Jesus is called \"the chief cornerstone\".\n\nIn the original Greek the word translated as \"Peter\" is \"Πέτρος\" (Petros) and that translated as \"rock\" is \"πέτρα\" (petra), two words that, while not identical, give an impression of one of many times when Jesus used a play on words. Furthermore, since Jesus presumably spoke to Peter in their native Aramaic language, he would have used \"kepha\" in both instances. The Peshitta Text and the Old Syriac text use the word \"kepha\" for both \"Peter\" and \"rock\" in . says Jesus called Simon \"Cephas\", as does Paul in some letters. He was instructed by Christ to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles. Peter also had a leadership role in the early Christian church at Jerusalem according to The Acts of the Apostles chapters 1–2, 10–11, and 15.\n\nEarly Catholic Latin and Greek writers (such as St. John Chrysostom) considered the \"foundation rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his confession of faith (or the faith of his confession) symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large. This \"double meaning\" interpretation is present in the current \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\".\n\nProtestant counter-claims to the Catholic interpretation are largely based on the difference between the Greek words translated \"Rock\" in the Matthean passage. In classical Attic Greek \"petros\" generally meant \"pebble,\" while \"petra\" meant \"boulder\" or \"cliff\". Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean \"pebble\", they argue that the \"rock\" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koiné Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of \"petros\" and \"petra\".\nHowever, even though the feminine noun \"petra\" is translated as \"rock\" in the phrase \"on this rock I will build my church,\" the word \"petra\" (πέτρα in Greek) is also used at in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: \"They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.\"\n\nAlthough is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the sixteenth century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.\n\nAnother rebuttal of the Catholic position is that if \"Peter\" really means \"the Rock\" which makes him the chief of Apostles, it would contradict the Bible's teaching in which says that the church's foundation is the apostles and prophets, not Peter alone. They posit that the meaning of is that Jesus uses a play on words with Peter's name to say that the confession he had just made is the rock on which the church is built.\n\nOther theologically conservative Christians, including Confessional Lutherans, also rebut comments made by Karl Keating and D.A. Carson who claim that there is no distinction between the words \"petros\" and \"petra\" in Koine Greek. The Lutheran theologians state that the dictionaries of Koine/NT Greek, including the authoritative Bauer-Danker-Arndt-Gingrich Lexicon, indeed list both words and the passages that give different meanings for each. Conservative Lutheran apologists state:\n\nPartial support for the Catholic position comes from Oscar Cullmann. He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \"rock\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter \"was\" the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\" Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic Koine dialect in which there is no distinction in meaning between \"petros\" and \"petra\". Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of \"petros\" was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in Sophocles, \"Oedipus at Colonus\" v. 1595, where \"petros\" refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a \"petros\"/\"petra\" distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun \"petra\" could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of \"Petros\" as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic \"Kepha\".\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact \"did\" mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun \"taute\", which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", \"kai\". It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with \"kai\", the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.\n\nThe New Apostolic Church believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first Chief Apostle in the Early Church.\n\nFrom the \"Book of Concord\": \n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, Confessional Lutherans and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, \"not\" Aramaic.\n\nModern Lutheran historians even disclose that the Catholic church didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the \"Rock\" until the 1870s:\n\nLutheran apologists criticize:\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) accept the primacy of Peter, although it does not generally use the term. The LDS Church teaches that Peter was the chief apostle and head of the Church after Christ's ascension. The LDS Church further teaches that all Melchizedek Priesthood authority in the Church must come through a line of authority traceable directly from Christ through Peter. However, in contrast to other groups, they believe that the line of succession was at some point broken following the death of the apostles, necessitating a restoration of the priesthood authority. The LDS Church teaches that this restoration occurred with the appearance of the resurrected Peter, James, and John, who ordained Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in 1829. All ordained members of the LDS Church can obtain a written line of authority tracing back to Christ through Peter.\n\nDespite the acceptance of Peter's primacy, several leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) have taught that the rock referred to by Jesus in Matthew 16:18 was neither Peter nor his confession, but the gift of revelation from the Holy Spirit which made Christ's divinity known to Peter. Apostle Howard W. Hunter taught: \n\nChurch founder Joseph Smith is quoted as having said: \n\nIt is important to note that although these quotes may represent normative LDS belief, none of them are from canonized doctrinal sources. The LDS Church therefore has no official doctrinal interpretation of Matthew 16:18 in this respect.\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Las Parejas, Santa Fe Province, and played as a forward throughout his footballing career. He is currently working as a commentator for BeIN Sports (Spain).He had a major influence in Argentina's 1986 World Cup triumph, including a goal in the final, the Real Madrid striker scored a total of 4 goals in the 1986 World Cup, and played a major role in Argentina's 1986 World Cup victory.\n\nWith the Argentina national team, Valdano took part at the 1975 Copa América as well as the 1982 and 1986s FIFA World Cups, the latter of which Argentina won. He scored four goals in the 1986 tournament, including Argentina's second goal against West Germany in the final. In total, he earned 23 caps for his nation between 1975 and 1990, scoring seven goals.\n\nAlthough he initially played for Newell's Old Boys, Alavés and Real Zaragoza, his most successful period at club level was at Real Madrid, where he won La Liga twice, the Copa de la Liga and two UEFA Cups. As a manager, he coached Spanish sides Tenerife, Real Madrid and Valencia. Considered a benchmark for the way he addressed various football clubs, Valdano participated in 2013 at the World Leadership Forum and in the World Business Forum in Mexico City, where he associated the world of sports and business behind it, where he listed the 11 powers of leadership, based on his last book.\n\nValdano is sometimes nicknamed \"The Philosopher of Football\". He was part of the Argentine team that won the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico (he scored Argentina's second goal in their 3–2 victory over West Germany), a starter for La Liga giants Real Madrid, and later became sporting director of the Spanish club.\n\nValdano started playing when he was 16 years old for Rosario's club Newell's Old Boys, where he also started playing professionally, as well as with the Argentina national football team, in 1972.\n\nIn 1975, he was transferred to Alavés of the Spanish Segunda División, where he played until 1979. In that year, he moved to Real Zaragoza of the Primera División, and then to Real Madrid in 1984, playing with the \"Quinta del Buitre\". He helped them win the UEFA Cup in 1985 and 1986, scoring once in the 1985 final and twice in the 1986 final.\n\nStricken by hepatitis, he decided to retire in 1988 and became a sports commentator \n\nValdano began his management career as the Real Madrid youth team coach. In April 1992, just before the end of the 1991–92 season, he became head coach of Tenerife, replacing fellow Argentinian Jorge Solari. He helped Tenerife avoid relegation at the end of 1991-92, and then the following season helped them qualify for the UEFA Cup. He also twice led Tenerife to final day victories that denied his former club Real Madrid winning the La Liga title (Barcelona winning it instead on both occasions). He then returned to Real Madrid in 1994, now as a coach, and led them to the 1994–95 Liga title.\n\nHe finally coached Valencia in 1996–97 before becoming Real Madrid's sporting director until his resignation in June 2005. In June 2009, he again returned to Real Madrid as director general and presidential aide. He was sacked from the position on 25 May 2011, however, after his relationship with the coaching staff, particularly head coach José Mourinho, had deteriorated.\n\nValdano played 23 times for the Argentina national team between 1975 and 1990, scoring seven goals, four of them in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, including one against West Germany in the final. Other than the 1986 triumph, he also took part in the 1975 Copa América and the 1982 World Cup, but missed most of the latter tournament after being injured in Argentina's second game, against Hungary.\n\nValdano also wrote the book \"Sueños de fútbol\" (\"Dreams of football\") and edited the book \"Cuentos de fútbol\" (\"Football short stories\") by diverse authors.

At the time of his birth, he had an older sister, Hōjō Masako. Later on in the decade, he would have another brother, Hōjō Tokifusa, and a sister whose name remains unknown, but their birth dates are not known. The Hōjō clan was at that time in control of Izu, and Yoshitoki, being a Hōjō, was also a descendant of the Taira clan and also of the imperial family.\n\nAt that time, the Taira, under Taira no Kiyomori, had consolidated their power in Kyoto, the capital, and expelled the Minamoto clan, their rival. Minamoto no Yoshitomo, the head of the clan, was executed, while his sons who were not executed were exiled or ordered into monasteries. The cloistered emperor, Emperor Go-Shirakawa, as well as his son, the emperor at that time (who was a puppet), Emperor Nijō, were also in Kyoto. Minamoto no Yoritomo, Yoshitomo's heir, was exiled to Izu, which was where the Hōjō domains were. (His other brothers, Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori were ordered into monasteries near Kyoto).\n\nYoshitoki was from the first day of his life expected to succeed his father as the head of the Hōjō clan in Izu. He had a very close relationships with his siblings, especially his sister Masako, who was very tomboyish and would eat with the men (including her father, Tokimasa, and her brothers, Yoshitoki and Tokifusa) rather than with her sister and mother.\n\nIn 1179, Yoshitoki's sister Masako fell in love with the young Minamoto exile, Minamoto no Yoritomo, and they wed. The marriage was supported fully by the young heir, Yoshitoki. In 1180, Masako and Yoritomo had a daughter, Ō-Hime, who was very close with her maternal uncle, Yoshitoko. That same year, a disgruntled Prince Mochihito, a son of Go-Shirakawa, grew weary of the Taira leadership, believing he was denied the throne just so his young nephew, Emperor Antoku, who was half Taira, could be enthroned. He called the Minamoto leaders all over Japan to overthrow the Taira.\n\nYoritomo responded readily, and Yoshitoki, Masako, Tokimasa, and the entire Hōjō clan supported him. His half-brothers, Yoshitsune and Noriyori joined him. Yoritomo created his base east of Izu in Kamakura, located in Sagami Province. The Genpei War had begun, and Yoshitoki was ordered by his father to aid Yoritomo in any way he can. The next year, 1181, Taira no Kiyomori died, and was succeeded by his son, Taira no Munemori.\n\nIn 1182, the 19-year-old Yoshitoki, amidst the war, wed. His wife is unknown. We do know that in 1183, they had their first child, Hōjō Yasutoki, who would become the heir to the Hōjō following his father's death. The previous year, Yoritomo and Masako had a son, who would be the Minamoto heir, Minamoto no Yoriie. In 1183, Yoritomo's rival and cousin, Minamoto no Yoshinaka, entered Kyoto and drove out the Heike (and the young Emperor Antoku). Yoshinaka was then driven out of Kyoto by Yoshitsune in the name of Yoritomo. The Minamoto quickly enthroned Emperor Go-Toba.\n\nIn 1185, the Genpei War ended when the Minamoto defeated the Taira at the Battle of Dan no Ura, and most of the Taira leaders were executed or committed suicide (including Emperor Antoku, who drowned). The Minamoto were now in control of Japan, and established their base in Kamakura. This also placed the Hōjō in a very powerful position as well. That year, Hōjō Tokimasa received from Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa the first appointments for \"jitō\" and \"shugo\", or constable and steward.\n\nIn 1192, cloistered emperor Go-Shirakawa (who died later that year) bestowed upon Yoritomo the title of \"shōgun\". That same year, Masako and Yoritomo had another son, Minamoto no Sanetomo. Yoshitoki was now also in a very powerful position, especially after Yoritomo died in 1199. Masako became a nun, but was still involved in politics, while Yoshitoko prepared to be heir.\n\nHōjō Tokimasa became regent for Shogun Yoriie, Yoritomo's son who disliked the Hōjō and preferred his father-in-law's family, the Hiki clan under Hiki Yoshikazu. Yoshitoki, Masako, and Tokimasa presided over a council of regents in 1200 to help Yoriie in ruling the country, but Yoriie distrusted the Hōjō, and in 1203 plotted with Yoshikazu to have Hōjō Tokimasa murdered. Yoshitoki had no idea about this, but Masako found out and told her father. Tokimasa had Yoshikazu executed in 1203. During the gore, Yoriie's son and heir, Minamoto no Ichiman, was also executed. Yoriie, out of support, abdicated in 1203, went to live in Izu, and was executed on Tokimasa's orders in 1204. Both Masako and Yoshitoki were not expecting this.\n\nLater on, Minamoto no Sanetomo, Yoritomo's second son, became shogun. Tokimasa ruled as regent for him also, but he fell out with the Hōjō, and Tokimasa plotted to have him executed. During this period, a certain Hatakeyama Shigetada, Yoshitoki's brother in law who had married his sister (not Masako) was executed by Tokimasa's men, on false charges of treason. Yoshitoki had been close with him, and began to distrust his father. When there were plans to have Sanetomo executed also, Masako and Yoshitoki ordered their father to abdicate or they would rebel. Tokimasa shaved his head, became a monk, and retired to a monastery/nunnery in Kamakura, only dying in 1215.\n\nHōjō Yoshitoki thus succeeded Tokimasa as \"shikken\" (regent).\n\nYoshitoki's regency was very quiet and uneventful until the final few years of it. He was aided by his sister, the \"nun-\"shōgun\"\" Masako. In 1218, Regent Yoshitoki sent Masako to Kyoto to ask the now Cloistered Emperor Go-Toba if one of his sons, Prince Nagahito, could become Shogun Sanetomo's heir, since he had no children. She was refused.\n\nIn 1219, Shogun Sanetomo was assassinated by his nephew, the late Yoriie's son, who was later murdered himself. Thus, the Minamoto line died out. That same year, Regent Yoshitoki chose a distant Minamoto relative, Kujō Yoritsune, who was of the Kujō clan and thus a Fujiwara. He was the new Shogun, but Yoshitoki was still regent.\n\nIn 1221, the Jōkyū War occurred. Cloistered emperor Go-Toba, disillusioned with the Hōjō, declared Regent Yoshitoki an outlaw and wanted him executed. Kyoto was now in open rebellion, Yoshitoki ordered his troops to attack Kyoto, and the city was taken in 1221. Masako helped discover the plot. Go-Toba was exiled to the Oki Islands. Yoshitoki's son, Hōjō Yasutoki, took the capital.\n\nNonetheless, in 1224, Hōjō Yoshitoki suddenly died of an illness. He was 61 years old. He was succeeded by his son and heir, Hōjō Yasutoki, as the third \"Shikken\" for Shogun Yoritsune. His sister Masako survived him for a year, before she to succumbed in 1225 at the age of 69.\n"}

The muscles in the throat are then held apart with forceps, and the protruding cartilage is shaved down with a scalpel, thus making the throat appear smoother and less angular. The incision is then closed with sutures, and a red line will mark the incision for about six weeks. Little scarring occurs in most cases because the surgeon will usually make the incision in one of the minuscule folds of skin that cover the Adam's apple.\n\nThe surgery is usually outpatient unless it is combined with other surgeries that require hospital stays. Particular care must be taken by the surgeon to not remove too much cartilage, as doing so can reduce the structure of the trachea and cause breathing difficulties.\n\nMost surgeons who specialize in sex reassignment surgery offer the procedure, and some general plastic surgeons will as well. It is one of the more common surgeries performed on trans women, along with genital reconstruction.\n\nDue to the proximity of the vocal folds, there is the small possibility that they may be damaged during this type of surgery. Generally, however, the patient's voice is unaffected, although there have been reports of slight change in pitch. Some patients will choose to undergo additional vocal surgery at the same time in order to minimize voice-related dysphoria.\n\nIt is recommended by many surgeons that the patient frequently rub the site of the incision to prevent noticeable scar tissue from forming. Swelling and bruising around the site of the incision is common, and patients may also experience difficulty swallowing and speaking, to a greater or lesser degree depending on the individual.\n\nThe average time for complete recovery is about two weeks, although it can sometimes take longer if the patient has pre-existing medical conditions such as anemia.\n\n"}

It is part of the Greater Western Sydney region.\n\nThe land currently occupied by the present-day suburb of Oakhurst was originally zoned as rural, with poultry and vegetable farms existing well in the mid-20th century. In 1981, the land was zoned as residential by the NSW State Government. Shortly after, the Land Commission of NSW (Landcom) began developing land bounded by Jersey Rd to the south, Daniels Rd to the west, Cook Rd to the north and Rooty Hill Rd North to the east. Landcom named the development, at this point still officially recognised as Plumpton, \"The Oaks Estate\", in honour of a historical residence retained by Landcom on Hyatts Road. Landcom constructed an Exhibition Village at Bancroft Street and Darkon Place, where prospective buyers could view a selection of homes prior to purchase and construction. An Information Centre was located at the entrance of the Village, and both were featured in an official Landcom television advertisement starring Australian television personalities Julie McGregor and Dave Gibson.\n\nThe majority of \"The Oaks Estate\" had been completed by 1985, and the NSW Geographical Name Board moved quickly to officially name the suburb \"Hassall\", in honour of Reverend Thomas Hassall who established Western Sydney's first Sunday School. However, the name was a source of contention amongst local residents, who cited ridicule and irrelevance to the area as justification for a name change. It was assumed the official suburb name would be reflective of Landcom's estate name, \"The Oaks\", and in their first act as a community, residents successfully lobbied the Board to have the name changed to \"Oakhurst\". Residents to the west of Daniels Rd who were also part of Landcom's Oaks Estate, were left disappointed when their section of the development was incorporated into Hebersham, a neighbouring public housing community, rather than Oakhurst.\n\nBy 1991, construction of a new estate to the north of Oakhurst, known as Hassall Grove, had commenced. However, developers and the community alike agreed that Cook Rd was insufficient to handle the increased traffic volume another suburb would bring. As such, Luxford Road was extended in a south-easterly direction and joined with an upgraded portion of Cook Road to become the area's new thoroughfare. Developers agreed the new road would form a more suitable boundary between Oakhurst and the new development. \n\nConsequently, the small portion of houses that had already been constructed, or were in the process of construction, along Southee Circuit, Bancroft Street, Westcott Place, Ophelia Place, Rotuma Street, Appletree Grove and Dimascio Place, were officially severed from Hassall Grove and absorbed into Oakhurst. Major portions of Cook Rd that were not utilised in the Luxford Rd extension, were either closed to traffic, or rejuvenated with lawns and children's play equipment.\n\nOakhurst's local shopping centre is Plumpton Marketplace, home to major retailers and corporations including Woolworths, BigW, the Commonwealth Bank and Flight Centre. Hassall Grove Plaza, on the other hand, provides residents with a local green grocer, bakery, hair salons and take-away shops.\n\nRichard Johnson Anglican School is Oakhurst's flagship school, serving students from Kindergarten to Year 12.\n\nOakhurst shares a local soccer team with Plumpton, the Plumpton/Oakhurst Soccer Club inc., whose home ground is located at Hanna Reserve, Hyatts Road. The team is a part of the Blacktown & Districts Soccer Football Association incorporated, which hosts annual competitions that involve teams from surrounding suburbs and districts, with players of varying age groups.\n\nOakhurst has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nOakhurst is ideally located between Plumpton and Marsden Park.

It was developed by J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves at SRI International. The full name of the algorithm is DUAL finite-state machine (DUAL FSM). EIGRP is responsible for the routing within an autonomous system, and DUAL responds to changes in the routing topology and dynamically adjusts the routing tables of the router automatically.\n\nEIGRP uses a feasibility condition to ensure that only loop-free routes are ever selected. The feasibility condition is conservative: when the condition is true, no loops can occur, but the condition might under some circumstances reject all routes to a destination although some are loop-free.\n\nWhen no feasible route to a destination is available, the DUAL algorithm invokes a diffusing computation to ensure that all traces of the problematic route are eliminated from the network. At which point the normal Bellman–Ford algorithm is used to recover a new route.\n\nDUAL uses three separate tables for the route calculation. These tables are created using information exchanged between the EIGRP routers. The information is different than that exchanged by link-state routing protocols. In EIGRP, the information exchanged includes the routes, the \"metric\" or cost of each route, and the information required to form a neighbor relationship (such as AS number, timers, and K values). The three tables and their functions in detail are as follows:\n\n\nDUAL evaluates the data received from other routers in the topology table and calculates the primary (successor) and secondary (feasible successor) routes. The primary path is usually the path with the lowest metric to reach the destination, and the redundant path is the path with the second lowest cost (if it meets the feasibility condition). There may be multiple successors and multiple feasible successors. Both successors and feasible successors are maintained in the topology table, but only the successors are added to the routing table and used to route packets.\n\nFor a route to become a feasible successor, its RD must be smaller than the FD of the successor. If this feasibility condition is met, there is no way that adding this route to the routing table could cause a loop.\n\nIf all the successor routes to a destination fail, the feasible successor becomes the successor and is immediately added to the routing table. If there is no feasible successor in the topology table, a query process is initiated to look for a new route.\n\n\"Legend:\"\n\nNow a client on router E wants to talk to a client on router A. That means a route between router A and router E must be available. This route is calculated as follows:\n\nThe immediate neighbours of router E are router C and router D. DUAL in router E asks for the reported distance (RD) from routers C and D respectively to router A. The following are the results:\nThe route via C is therefore in the lowest cost. In the next step, the distance from router E to the neighbours are added to the reported distance to get the feasible distance (FD):\nDUAL therefore finds that the route via D has the least total cost. Then the route via D will be marked as \"successor\", equipped with passive status and registered in the routing table. The route via C is kept as a \"feasible successor\", because its RD is less than the FD of the successor:\n"}

The conjecture also ascribes an asymptotic density to these primes. This conjectural density equals Artin's constant or a rational multiple thereof.\n\nThe conjecture was made by Emil Artin to Helmut Hasse on September 27, 1927, according to the latter's diary. The conjecture is still unresolved as of 2019. In fact, there is no single value of \"a\" for which Artin's conjecture is proved.\n\nLet \"a\" be an integer that is not a perfect square and not −1. Write \"a\" = \"a\"\"b\" with \"a\" square-free. Denote by \"S\"(\"a\") the set of prime numbers \"p\" such that \"a\" is a primitive root modulo \"p\". Then the conjecture states\n\nSimilar conjectural product formulas\n\nexist for the density when \"a\" does not satisfy the above conditions. In these cases, the conjectural density is always a rational multiple of \"C\".\n\nFor example, take \"a\" = 2. The conjecture claims that the set of primes \"p\" for which 2 is a primitive root has the above density \"C\". The set of such primes is \nIt has 38 elements smaller than 500 and there are 95 primes smaller than 500. The ratio (which conjecturally tends to \"C\") is 38/95 = 2/5 = 0.4.\n\nIn 1967, Christopher Hooley published a conditional proof for the conjecture, assuming certain cases of the generalized Riemann hypothesis.\n\nWithout the generalized Riemann hypothesis, there is no single value of \"a\" for which Artin's conjecture is proved. D. R. Heath-Brown proved (Corollary 1) that at least one of 2, 3, or 5 is a primitive root modulo infinitely many primes \"p\". He also proved (Corollary 2) that there are at most two primes for which Artin's conjecture fails.\n\n"}

It is named for the two streets that cross at its center, northeast-only Fairlie and southeast-only Poplar. Fairlie–Poplar is immediately north of Five Points, the definitive centerpoint and longtime commercial heart of Atlanta. It is roughly bounded on the southwest by Marietta Street, on the southeast by Peachtree Street or Park Place, on the northeast by Luckie Street or Williams Street, and on the northwest by Cone Street or Spring Street. It has smaller city blocks than the rest of the city (about half by half), and the streets run at a 40° diagonal.\n\nFairlie–Poplar contains many commercial and office buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Local interpretations of prevailing national architectural styles, including Chicago, Renaissance revival, neoclassical, commercial, art deco, Georgian revival, and Victorian styles, are found here. The buildings of the district also represent the shift in building technology from load-bearing masonry and timber walls to steel and concrete framing. Individual buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Places that lie within the Fairlie–Poplar Historic District include the Flatiron Building, Rhodes-Haverty Building, the Empire/C&S Building, the Healey Building, the Prudential/W.D. Grant Building, the Retail Credit Company Home Office Building, the Elbert P. Tuttle United States Court of Appeals Building.\n\nFairlie–Poplar developed during the late 19th century, when Atlanta emerged as the commercial center of Georgia and the Southeast. At the time, the area was promoted as \"Atlanta's new modern fireproof business district\". It constituted a major northward expansion of Atlanta's post-Civil War business district, which was largely concentrated along Peachtree and Alabama Street (now Underground Atlanta) and along Marietta Street. The new business district contained a wide variety of wholesale and retail operations, which marketed a broad spectrum of consumer goods and services. Public agencies and many of Atlanta's business offices were also located there.\n\nBuilding materials included brick, stone, cast iron, wood, pressed metal, glazed terra-cotta, and plate glass. The buildings in the district range in height from two to 16 stories, the taller ones constructed with concrete or steel frames, while the smaller buildings were built with load-bearing masonry and timber structural systems.\n\nA few of the buildings that make up the Georgia State University campus are woven into the Fairlie–Poplar district. The first building that was acquired in Fairlie–Poplar was the former C&S Bank Building on Marietta Street in 1993, which became the J. Mack Robinson College of Business Administration Building. The Rialto Center for the Arts and the Haas-Howell Building followed in 1996 on the corner of Forsyth St. and Luckie St. The Helen M. Aderhold Learning Center is also located on Luckie Street and is one of the most modern lecture buildings on the campus. The Aderhold Center also provides retail and restaurant space on the street level surrounding it, causing it to further blend into the district.\n\nThe Georgia State University School of Music occupies the Standard Building on the corner of Fairlie St. and Luckie St., as well as the Haas-Howell Building on Poplar St.\n\n"}

His novel \"A Disaffection\" was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction in 1989. Kelman won the 1994 Booker Prize with \"How Late It Was, How Late\". In 1998 Kelman was awarded the Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Award. His 2008 novel \"Kieron Smith, Boy\" won both of Scotland's principal literary awards: the Saltire Society's Book of the Year and the Scottish Arts Council Book of the Year.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Kelman says:\n\nMy own background is as normal or abnormal as anyone else's. Born and bred in Govan and Drumchapel, inner city tenement to the housing scheme homeland on the outer reaches of the city. Four brothers, my mother a full time parent, my father in the picture framemaking and gilding trade, trying to operate a one man business and I left school at 15 etc. etc. (...) For one reason or another, by the age of 21/22 I decided to write stories. The stories I wanted to write would derive from my own background, my own socio-cultural experience. I wanted to write as one of my own people, I wanted to write and remain a member of my own community.\n\nDuring the 1970s he published a first collection of short stories. He became involved in Philip Hobsbaum's creative writing group in Glasgow along with Tom Leonard, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Aonghas MacNeacail and Jeff Torrington and his short stories began to appear in magazines. These stories introduced a distinctive style, expressing first person internal monologues in a pared-down prose using Glaswegian speech patterns, though avoiding for the most part the quasi-phonetic rendition of Tom Leonard. Kelman's developing style has been influential on the succeeding generation of Scottish novelists, including Irvine Welsh, Alan Warner and Janice Galloway. In 1998, Kelman received the Stakis Prize for \"Scottish Writer of the Year\" for his collection of short stories \"The Good Times\".\n\nIn 2019, James Kelman's official website was launched, JamesKelman.Net, which is accessible via: \n\nKelman's Booker Prize win was, at the time, controversial due to what some saw as the book's casual use of bad language: one of the judges, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, denounced the awarding of the prize to Kelman's book as \"a disgrace\". Kelman has since said that his Booker Prize win, specifically the negative publicity and attacks made as a result, made publishers more reluctant to handle his work.\n\nThe debate surrounding the use of this \"offensive\" language has been picked up by Kelman himself, who argues that the \"Standard English\" of traditional English novels is unrealistic. In his essay \"The Importance of Glasgow in my Work\", he compares the presentation of working class and Scottish characters with those of the traditional \"upper class\" English protagonist:\n\nKelman's work has been described as flowing \"not only from being an \"engaged\" writer, but a cultural and political activist\". At the time of Glasgow's Year as City of Culture he was prominent in the Workers' City group, critical of the celebrations. The name was chosen as to draw attention to the renaming of part of the city centre as the Merchant City, which they described as promoting the \"fallacy that Glasgow somehow exists because of (...) 18th century entrepreneurs and far-sighted politicians. (The merchants) were men who trafficked in degradation, causing untold misery, death and starvation to thousands\" The Workers' City group campaigned against what was seen as the victimisation of People's Palace curator Elspeth King and a Council attempt to sell off one third of Glasgow Green. Their activities drew the ire of Labour Party councillors and commentators, with Kelman, and his colleagues Hugh Savage and Farquhar McLay, being described as \"an 'embarrassment' to the city's 'cultural workforce'\".\n\nKelman was involved in the Edinburgh Unemployed Workers Centre, giving a speech at its opening, and has expressed support for the Autonomous Centre of Edinburgh (ACE), its successor organisation.\n\nKelman has been a prominent campaigner, notably in issues of social justice and traditional left-wing causes, although he is resolutely not a party man, and remains at his heart a libertarian socialist anarchist, saying \"the parliamentary opposition parties are essential to the political apparatus of this country which is designed to arrest justice\". He lives in Glasgow with his wife and children, though has also lived in London, Manchester, the Channel Islands, Australia and America.\n\nIn his introduction to \"Born up a Close: Memoirs of a Brigton Boy\" (2006), an edition of Glaswegian political campaigner Hugh Savage's writings, Kelman sums up his understanding of the history of national and class conflict as follows:\nIn an occupied country indigenous history can only be radical. It is a class issue. The intellectual life of working class people is ‘occupied’. In a colonised country intellectual occupation takes place throughout society. The closer to the ruling class we get the less difference there exists in language and culture, until finally we find that questions fundamental to society at its widest level are settled by members of the same closely knit circle, occasionally even the same family or ‘bloodline’. And the outcome of that can be war, the slaughter of working class people.\n\nDespite reservations about nationalism, Kelman has voiced his support for Scottish independence, stating \"Any form of nationalism is dangerous, and should be treated with caution. I cannot accept nationalism and I am not a Scottish Nationalist. But once that is said, I favour a Yes or No decision on independence and I shall vote Yes to independence.\" In 2012 a film was made based on the short story \"Greyhound For Breakfast\". He has voiced criticism of Scottish arts funding council Creative Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The secular and aesthetic mix of the city with its prominent buildings based on French and Indo-Saracenic architecture self-narrate its princely past. It is also known as city of Palaces & Gardens. According to the 2011 Census, Kapurthala is the least populated city in India.\n\nKapurthala was once the capital of Kapurthala State, a princely state in pre-independence India, ruled by the Ahluwalia Sikh rulers. \nKapurthala flag has two color background, with insgnia and moto that says \"pro rege et patria\" (in Latin) meaning \"For king and country\"\n\nAs per provisional data of 2011 census Kapurthala had a population of 101,854, out of which males were 55,485 and females were 46,169. The literacy rate was 85.82 per cent.\n\nThe City of Kapurthala has several buildings and places of interest linked to its local history such as the Sainik School (Formerly \"Jagatjit Palace\"), Shalimar Bagh (Gardens), District Courts buildings, Moorish Mosque, Panch Mandir (\"Five Temples\"), Clock Tower, State Gurudwara, Kanjli Wetlands, Guru Nanak Sports Stadium, Jagjit Club, and the NJSA Government college.The city also have first climatic change theater of country.\n\nThe Sainik School, formerly known as Jagatjit Palace, is housed in what was formerly the palace of the erstwhile Maharajah of Kapurthala state, Maharajah Jagatjit Singh. The palace building's architecture is based on the Palace of Versailles and Fontainebleau and is spread over a total area of . It was designed by a French architect M. Marcel and built by a local builder Allah Ditta. It was built in renaissance style with the sunken park in the front (Known as Baija). Its Durbar Hall (Diwan-E-Khas) is one of the finest in India, and the Plaster of Paris figures and painted ceilings represent the finest features of French and Italian art and architecture. The construction of this palace was commenced in 1900 and completed in 1908 in time for the new wife of the Maharajah Anita Delgado.\n\nThe Elysee Palace was built by Kanwar Bikrama Singh in 1862. This building has now been converted into MGN School of Kapurthala.\n\nAn example of the secular history of Kapurthala is the Moorish Mosque, a replica of the Grand Mosque of Marakesh, Morocco, was built by a French architect, Monsieur M Manteaux. Its construction was commissioned by the last ruler of Kapurthala, Maharajah Jagatjit Singh and took 13 years to complete between 1917 and 1930. It was then consecrated in the presence of the late Nawab of Bhawalpur. The Mosque's inner dome contains decorations by the artists of the Mayo School of Art, Lahore. The Mosque is a National Monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. It was one of the monumental creations in the State during the premiership of late Diwan Sir Abdul Hamid Kt., CIE, OBE. It was his keen interest with Maharaja's blessings that the mosque was completed. Its wooden model lay at the entrance of the Lahore Museum.\n\nJagatjit Club is an elegant building situated in the heart of the city based on the Greek roman style of architecture. Its design loosely resembles the Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens and features the Coat of Arms of the erstwhile ruling family of Kapurthala with their royal motto \"Pro Rege et Patria\" (For King and Country) on its pediment. The building has been used for a variety of purposes since it was constructed, it was used as a church in the early nineteenth century, as a cinema hall in the 1940s and now houses a local club which includes a well built badminton court, a card room and a dining hall.\n\nShalimar Gardens are situated in roughly the centre of the city and provide an escape from the hustle-bustle of the city. The Shahi Samadhs (The Royal Cenotaphs) in the Shalimar Gardens emphasize the traditions of its ruling Dynasty. Marble obelisks inside the red sandstone Chambers, are Memorials to the former Rulers and their families. Nearby, a grand structure built in 1880 and built on a marble plinth, houses the Samadhs of Maharajas Kharak Singh, Jagatjit Singh and Paramjit Singh.\n\nPanch Mandir of Kapurthala is a place of reverence for all faiths. The temple complex is home to five small temples. Built during the reign of Sardar Fateh Singh, an extraordinary feature of this temple is that from the entry door, one can view all the five idols and pay obeisance to all. There is a temple Mandir Shivala Dewan Banna Mal Gautam in Nawanshahr Which is replica of Panch Mandir Kapurthala. Dewan Banna Mal Gautam was Chief Minister of Kapurthala State and Manager of His Highness Maharaja Sir Randhir Singh Bahadur of Kapurthala's estates in Oudh.\n\nThe large and imposing red sandstone building (now painted white) of the State Gurudwara was consecrated in 1915 under the in charge of Revail Singh. Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, it has vast expanses of marble haloed by the feet of the hundreds of devotees. It is situated in the center of the city on the Sultanpur road. Recently, it is being renovated. There is a big park behind the Gurudwara building.\n\n11 Mukhi Shiv Ling Brahmkund Temple is jathere of Gautam Brahmin Family of Dewan Banna Mal Gautam (Misr).

Dewan Banna Mal was Dewan of Maharaja Randhir Singh Bahadur of Kapurthala and Manager of Kapurthala's estate in Oudh. Bana Mala Wala village in Mand area of Kapurthala is after Banna Mal's Name and Dewan Banna Mal has also built Shivala Dewa Banna Mal in Nawanshahr.\n\nThe Gurdwara Ber Sahib is situated at Sultanpur Lodhi, which is one of the four sub-divisions (Tehsil) of Kapurthala. This historic site is of great importance to Sikhism as it is said to be the very place where the First Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak, spent 14 years(14 years 9 months 13 days) of his life . The place derives its name from a \"Ber\" tree (Zizyphus Jujuba) said to be planted by Guru Nanak himself and under which he first uttered the Mool Mantra or the \"Sacred Word or Revelation\" of Sikhism.\n\nKanjli Wetlands, on the western Bein rivulet at the outskirts of the city, has been included in under the Ramsar Convention. It is a common site for bird watching and boating. An enormous project is currently being undertaken here to develop it into a destination for bird watching replete with modern-day facilities.

It was named \"Feniton\" after the nearest village, but less than a year later it was renamed (on 1 July 1861) as \"Ottery and Sidmouth Road\". In February 1868 this was changed again to \"Feniton for Ottery St Mary\". On 6 July 1874 a branch line to was opened and the station changed its name once more to become \"Sidmouth Junction\", a name that it managed to retain for more than 90 years.\n\nOn 1 May 1897 a new line to was opened and this was extended on 1 June 1903 to . Although the junction for this line was at , Sidmouth Junction was the \"de facto\" junction as it was situated on the London main line. A third platform was provided to accommodate branch line trains; this was a terminal bay at the Yeovil end of the westbound platform. It was on this platform that the main two-storey building was situated.\n\nA goods yard and goods shed was provided adjacent to the bay platform. This was closed on 6 September 1965. The following year saw the withdrawal of local stopping trains on the main line, but Sidmouth Junction remained open until 6 March 1967 when passenger services were withdrawn from the branch lines.\n\nThe station was however reopened by British Rail on 5 May 1971 as a result of local campaigning by the residents of the expanding village, assuming the original \"Feniton\" name. A ticket office was erected in 1974 as the original building had been demolished while the station was closed. The platform was rebuilt and lengthened in 1992 but is still shorter than many of the trains that call.\n\nThe station was built next to the level crossing of the Ottery Road which was operated by the station staff. A signal box was provided in 1875 at the east end of the station on the north side of the line, opposite goods yard. Because it was too far from the level crossing a small signal box was provided at that end of the station to control the level crossing. The main signal box was closed on 21 May 1967 but the level crossing box was retained. The line through the station reduced to just a single track on 11 June 1967. In 1974 the level crossing gates were replaced by lifting barriers; the level crossing box was abolished at the same time and the barriers were operated from a panel within the station building until March 2012 when signalling and level crossing control was transferred to Basingstoke Area Signalling Centre.\n\nThe platform is on the south side of the line, east of the level crossing of Ottery Road. It is only long enough for 3 car trains so only the doors on the front unit are opened if the train is longer. The disused eastbound platform still stands but the goods yard site is now occupied by houses.\n\nSouth Western Railway operate at least a service every two hours between London Waterloo and Exeter St Davids. Due to the short platform at this station, passengers wishing to alight need to be in the front 3 coaches of the train as the platform can only take 3-car trains.\n\n\n"}

He is the twin brother of Dylan Sprouse and is known for his role as Cody Martin on the Disney Channel series \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" and its spinoff \"The Suite Life on Deck\". In 2017, Sprouse began starring as Jughead Jones on The CW television series \"Riverdale\".\n\nCole Mitchell Sprouse was born in Arezzo, Italy, to American parents Matthew Sprouse and Melanie Wright, while they were teaching at an English language school in Tuscany. Cole was born 15 minutes after his older twin brother Dylan Sprouse. Cole was named after jazz singer and pianist Nat King Cole. Four months after his birth, the family moved back to their parents' native Long Beach, California.\n\nCole and his brother, Dylan, began acting at the age of eight months following a suggestion from their grandmother, Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress. Much of Sprouse's early career was shared with his brother—some of their earliest roles were shared roles as one baby or child in commercials, television shows, and films. Due to child labor laws in California restricting the amount of time children can be filmed in a day, casting twins in a single role allows more time for one character to be filmed. Some notable roles he shared with his brother include the characters of Patrick Kelly in the sitcom \"Grace Under Fire\" from 1993 to 1998, Julian in the 1999 film, \"Big Daddy\", and young Pistachio Disguisey in 2002's \"The Master of Disguise\". In 2001, Cole began appearing in episodes of NBC's television sitcom \"Friends\", as Ross Geller's son, Ben; this role was his first role in which he did not appear with his brother. As he and his brother grew older, they began taking on more roles as separate characters but often still worked on the same projects. Their first role as separate characters in the same production was as kids in a \"MADtv\" sketch. Sprouse portrayed Cody Martin in the 2005 Disney Channel original series, \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\" alongside his brother; he reprised the role in the show's 2008 spinoff, \"The Suite Life on Deck\" and its related film.\n\nOn February 9, 2016, Sprouse was cast as Jughead Jones in The CW's teen drama series \"Riverdale\", based on the characters of \"Archie Comics\". The series premiered on January 26, 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Sprouse starred in \"Five Feet Apart\", a romantic drama which was released in March and performed well at the box office. He plays a cystic fibrosis patient who falls in love with a girl (played by Haley Lu Richardson) with the same disease. It was his second lead role in a major theatrical film, 20 years after his first, \"Big Daddy\".\n\nSprouse will produce and star in the eight-episode podcast \"Borrasca\", which is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\nSprouse is a fan of comics and worked at the Los Angeles comic store Meltdown.\n\nSprouse began attending New York University in 2011, after deferring one year. Initially interested in studying film and television production, he decided to enroll instead in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, pursuing the humanities and in particular archaeology. He graduated alongside his brother in May 2015. Sprouse worked briefly in the field of archaeology, participating in excavations and performing lab work. He specialized in geographical information systems and satellite imaging. During his studies he performed summer digs in both Europe and Asia. While engaged in his undergraduate work, he unearthed a mask of Dionysus on a dig in Bulgaria.\n\nSprouse has an avid interest in photography. In 2011, he launched a personal photography website and took classes at NYU. He has had shoot assignments for major fashion publications including \"Teen Vogue\", \"L'Uomo Vogue\", \"The Sunday Times Style\", and \"W Magazine\", among others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2085345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085345", "title": "Carbide lamp", "text": "Carbide lamp\n\nCarbide lamps, or acetylene gas lamps, are simple lamps that produce and burn acetylene (CH) which is created by the reaction of calcium carbide (CaC) with water (HO).\n\nAcetylene gas lamps were used to illuminate buildings, as lighthouse beacons, and as headlights on motor-cars and bicycles. Portable acetylene gas lamps, worn on the hat or carried by hand, were widely used in mining in the early twentieth century. They are still employed by cavers, hunters, and cataphiles. Small carbide lamps called \"carbide candles\" or \"smokers\" are used for blackening rifle sights to reduce glare. They are used because of the sooty flame produced by acetylene.\n\nA mining or caving lamp has calcium carbide placed in a lower chamber, the generator. The upper reservoir is then filled with water. A threaded valve or other mechanism is used to control the rate at which the water is allowed to drip into the chamber containing the calcium carbide. By controlling the rate of water flow, the production of acetylene gas is controlled. This, in turn, controls the flow rate of the gas and the size of the flame at the burner, and thus the amount of light it produces.\n\nThis type of lamp generally has a reflector behind the flame to help project the light forward. An acetylene gas powered lamp produces a bright, broad light. Many cavers prefer this type of unfocused light as it improves peripheral vision in the complete dark. The reaction of carbide with water is exothermic and produces a fair amount of heat independent of the flame. In cold caves, carbide lamp users can use this heat to help stave off hypothermia.\n\nAcetylene is produced by the reaction:\n\nThe acetylene combusts easily in the atmosphere:\n\nWhen all of the carbide in a lamp has been reacted, the carbide chamber contains a wet paste of slaked lime (Ca(OH)) which can be used to make a cement. This is emptied into a waste bag and the chamber can be refilled.\n\nIn 1892, Thomas Willson discovered an economically efficient process for creating calcium carbide in an electric arc furnace from a mixture of lime and coke. The arc furnace provides the high temperature required to drive the reaction. Manufacture of calcium carbide was an important part of the industrial revolution in chemistry, and was made possible in the US as a result of massive amounts of inexpensive hydroelectric power produced at Niagara Falls before the turn of the twentieth century. In 1895, Willson sold his patent to Union Carbide. Domestic lighting with acetylene gas was introduced circa 1894 and bicycle lamps from 1896. In France, Gustave Trouvé, a Parisian electrical engineer, also made domestic acetylene lamps and gasometers.\n\nThe first carbide bicycle lamp developed in the United States was patented in New York on August 28, 1900 by Frederick Baldwin. Another early lamp design is shown in a patent from Duluth, Minnesota on October 21, 1902. In the early 1900s, Gustaf Dalén invented the Dalén light. This combined two of Dalén's previous inventions: the substrate Agamassan and the Sun valve. Inventions and improvements to carbide lamps continued for decades.\n\nAfter carbide lamp open flames were implicated in an Illinois coal-seam methane gas explosion that killed 54 miners, the 1932 Moweaqua Coal Mine disaster, carbide lamp use declined in United States coal mines. They continued to be used in the coal pits of other countries, notably USSR.\n\nIn the birth of the cinema of Iquitos, a carbide lamp was used as light support to project the first film in the Casa de Fierro, in 1900.\n\nCarbide lighting was used in rural and urban areas of the United States which were not served by electrification. Its use began shortly after 1900 and continued past 1950. Calcium carbide pellets were placed in a container outside the home, with water piped to the container and allowed to drip on the pellets releasing acetylene. This gas was piped to lighting fixtures inside the house, where it was burned, creating a very bright flame. Carbide lighting was inexpensive but was prone to gas leaks and explosions.\n\nEarly models of the automobile, motorbike and bicycle used carbide lamps as headlamps. Acetylene gas, derived from carbide, enabled early automobiles to drive safely at night. Thick concave mirrors combined with magnifying lenses projected the acetylene flame light. These type of lights were used until reliable batteries and dynamos became available, and manufacturers switched to electric lights.\n\nAcetylene lamps were also used on riverboats for night navigation. The National Museum of Australia has a lamp made in about 1910 that was used on board , a paddle steamer which has been restored to working order and also in the museum's collection.\n\nThey are also used for night hunting.\n\nEarly caving enthusiasts, not yet having the advantage of light-weight electrical illumination, introduced the carbide lamp to their hobby. While increasingly replaced by more modern choices, a substantial percentage of cavers still use this method.\n\nIn cave surveys, carbide lamps are favoured for the lead or \"point\" surveyor, who must identify suitable points in the cave to designate as survey stations. The sooty carbide flame may be used to mark cave walls with a station label. Especially favoured for this purpose are all-brass lamps or lamps made with no ferromagnetic metals, as these lamps do not deflect the needles of a magnetic compass, which is typically read while brightly illuminated from above using the caver's lamp.\n\nApart from their use as cave surveying tools, many cavers favour carbide lamps for their durability and quality of illumination. They were once favoured for their relative illumination per mass of fuel compared to battery powered devices, but this advantage was largely negated with the advent of high-intensity LED illumination.\n\nThe acetylene producing reaction is exothermic, which means that the lamp's reactor vessel will become quite warm to the touch; this can be used to warm the hands. The heat from the flame can also be used to warm the body by allowing the exhaust gases to flow under a shirt or poncho pulled out from the body, a technique discovered almost immediately by cold miners, and nicknamed by cavers the \"Palmer furnace\".\n\n\n\n"}

In a few cases the \"sanjak-bey\" was himself directly answerable to Istanbul.\n\nLike other early Ottoman administrative offices, the \"sanjak-bey\" had a military origin: the term \"sanjak\" (and \"liva\") means \"flag\" or \"standard\" and denoted the insigne around which, in times of war, the cavalrymen holding fiefs (\"timars\" or \"ziamets\") in the specific district gathered. The \"sanjakbey\" was in turn subordinate to a \"beylerbey\" (\"Bey of Beys\") who governed an \"eyalet\" and commanded his subordinate \"sanjak-beys\" in war. In this way, the structure of command on the battlefield resembled the hierarchy of provincial government.\n\nThe office of \"sanjak-bey\" resembled that of the \"beylerbey\" on a more modest scale. Like the \"beylerbey\", the \"sanjak-bey\" drew his income from a prebend, which consisted usually of revenues from the towns, quays and ports within the boundary of his \"sanjak\". Within his own sanjak, a governor was responsible above all for maintaining order and, with the cooperation of the fief holders, arresting and punishing wrongdoers. For this, he usually received half of the fines imposed on miscreants, with the fief holder on whose lands the misdeed took place, receiving the other half. \"Sanjak\" governors also had other duties, for example, the pursuit of bandits, the investigation of heretics, the provision of supplies for the army, or the despatch of materials for shipbuilding, as the sultan commanded.\n\n"}

A Great Britain and England international, he played for the Leeds Rhinos (with whom he won the 1999 Challenge Cup), Sydney Roosters (winning the 2002 NRL Premiership and 2003 World Club Challenge), Bradford Bulls (winning Super League X in 2005), Warrington Wolves (winning the 2009, 2010 and 2012 Challenge Cups) and the Salford Red Devils. With a reputation as a tough, uncompromising competitor, Morley was the first British player to win both NRL and Super League championships.\n\nMorley was born in Salford, Greater Manchester, England.\n\nHe played for Leeds between 1995 and 2000. He made his England and Great Britain débuts in 1996. In the 1997 post-season, Morley was selected to play for Great Britain in all three matches of the Super League Test series against Australia. Morley played for Leeds as a in their 1998 Super League Grand Final loss to Wigan. He won the Challenge Cup with Leeds in 1999 when they defeated 52–16 at Wembley. He was offered a chance to play alongside his brother Chris Morley, who played for Wales, but chose to commit to England in the 2000 World Cup. In July 2000, Morley agreed to join Australian side Sydney Roosters in the National Rugby League at the end of the season, who were being coached by former Leeds boss Graham Murray.\n\nThe 2000 NRL season was Morley's first at the Roosters. After taking twelve months to fully acclimatise, the tough forward became a central figure in the club's twelfth Premiership – their first in 27 years – playing as a in the 2002 NRL Grand Final, a 30–8 victory over the New Zealand Warriors at Telstra Stadium. Having won the 2002 NRL Premiership, the Roosters travelled to England to play the 2003 World Club Challenge against Super League champions, St. Helens. Morley played and scored a try in the Roosters' victory. Later that year Morley played in the for the Roosters in the 2003 NRL Grand Final which was lost to Penrith Panthers.\n\nMorley played for the Roosters as a in their 2004 NRL Grand Final loss to cross-Sydney rivals, the Bulldogs. Morley was then selected in the Great Britain team to compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Australia he played as a in the Lions' 44–4 loss.\n\nIn a round 20 match towards the end of his final season (2006) with the Roosters, Morley was sent off after attempting to knee Bulldogs player Corey Hughes in the face as the player attempted to play the ball. Afterwards he was suspended by the NRL Judiciary, and the Roosters released him from his contract. He returned to the UK before the season's end.\n\nMorley had helped the Roosters to a World Club Challenge title as well as two further Grand Final appearances before joining English club Warrington. He is one of only eight Englishmen to have played in NRL Grand Final-winning teams. Morley is the only player to win Great Britain caps whilst at the Roosters, although Phil Clarke had won England caps whilst at the club.\n\nIn 2005 Morley became the first Englishman to have won Premierships in the NRL and Super League and the Rugby League Challenge Cup. In late 2005, although still contracted to Roosters; Morley joined Bradford Bulls towards the end of the season and helped them to claim the Super League championship against his old team Leeds. He played for the Bradford Bulls from the interchange bench in their 2005 Super League Grand Final victory against the Rhinos. His stay at Bradford was short as he joined Warrington the next season.\nMorley signed a 4-year deal with Warrington, beginning in 2006. He captained the Great Britain test side that faced France in 2007. He was also appointed captain of Warrington. It was while playing for Warrington that he made his 400th competitive senior appearance.\n\nMorley was named in the 24-man England squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and also played against Wales at the Keepmoat Stadium, Doncaster prior to England's departure. In Group A's first match against Papua New Guinea he played from the interchange bench in England's victory.\n\nMorley guided Warrington to Challenge Cup glory in 2009, beating Huddersfield in the final at Wembley. He was selected to play for England against France in the one-off test in 2010. \n\nMorley captained Warrington in the 2010 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium.\n\nMorley was to lead England in the 2010 Four Nations but was ruled out after injuring himself in a warm up match against the New Zealand Māori rugby league team.\n\nMorley played for England in the 2011 Four Nations. England made the tournament's final and in the final, Morley made his 50th international appearance.\n\nHe played in the 2012 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium.\n\nHe played in the 2012 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford.\n\nMorley's autobiography, \"\"Moz\"\", was released on 12 November 2012 and reprinted twice in the run up to Christmas 2012.\n\nHe played in the 2013 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Wigan Warriors at Old Trafford.\n\nMorley signed a one-year deal for his hometown club Salford for the 2014 season, aiming to finish his career with his hometown club. The 36-year-old forward was appointed the Salford Red Devils' captain at the start of the 2014 season.\n\nOn 10 September 2015, Adrian announced that he would retire from playing rugby league at the end of the 2015 season.\n\nOn 14 October 2015, it was announced that Morley would play one more rugby league match.

{"id": "2085458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085458", "title": "Ullenhall", "text": "Ullenhall\n\nUllenhall is a village and civil parish in the Stratford district of Warwickshire, England, situated about West of Henley in Arden and West of the county town of Warwick. The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 census was 717. The name means Ulla's nook, the Old English word hahl, meaning a nook or corner of land, suggesting the hollow in which the village is situated, being compounded with a personal name of Scandinavian origin.\n\nUllenhall is also going to be the home of an absolutely massive warehouse for Amazon, I mean absolutely massive \n\nThe manor is recorded in the Domesday Book where it is listed as \"Holehale\", one of the lands of Robert de Stafford. \"In Ferncombe Hundred in Holehale (Ullenhall) 1 hide. Land for 15 ploughs. 17 villagers and 11 smallholders with 6 ploughs. Woodland ½ league long and 1 furlong wide. The value was and is £3 Waga held it.\" Waga, whose name is preserved in the nearby village of Wootton Wawen, was one of the witness's to Earl Leofric's, husband of Lady Godiva, foundation of the monastery at Coventry during the first year of the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042/3). His lands extended beyond those at Ullenhall, but, following the Conquest, Ullenhall was bestowed by the conqueror on Robert de Stafford, descended from the de Tonei family and who had fought stoutly with Duke William against King Harold. He made Stafford his principal seat, where he had a strong castle and assumed his surname from thence.\n\nUllenhall stands on lands that were originally part of the Barrells Hall estate. The earliest mention of Barrells was a reference to a Richard Barel in 1405. In 1554 the estate was purchased by Robert Knight of Beoley, 4 miles west of Ullenhall, and remained in the Knight family until 1856. An inventory taken in 1652 shows that it was then an ordinary farmhouse, and a member of the Knight family appeared in the 1682 Heralds' Visitation of Warwick. The future 1st Earl, Robert Knight, Lord Luxborough, purchased Barrells from a cousin in 1730. When Henrietta St John was banished to Barrells in 1736 it was still a relatively simple house, in very poor condition. When his son married in 1750 he commissioned the Italian architect Joseph Bonomi the Elder to build an imposing extension, which thereafter became the main house. On Henrietta's death in 1756 her husband rebuilt large parts of it.\n\nHis wife Henrietta, Lady Luxborough, made the house the hub of a literary circle after her husband banished her to Barrells following a romantic indiscretion. She was one of the first to establish a \"ferme ornée\" and is credited with the invention of the word \"shrubbery\". She was a prominent member of the Warwickshire Coterie, a group of poet friends including the poet William Shenstone, who had developed his own \"ferme ornée\" at The Leasowes in Halesowen, Shropshire.\n\nThe family crest was a winged spur which gives its name to the village pub to this day. The Newtons owned the house after the Knights and extended it dramatically. However, the house was very seriously damaged by fire in 1933 and lay derelict until 2005 when it was restored as a family home.\n\nDespite its ancient roots, Ullenhall was not established as a separate Ecclesiastical Parish until June 1861 when the old manors of Apsley, Forde Hall and Mockley were also included in the parish.\n\nUllenhall is part of the Tanworth ward of Stratford on Avon District Council and represented by Councillors Peter Oakley and George Atkinson, Conservative. Nationally it is part of Stratford-on-Avon (UK Parliament constituency), whose current Member of Parliament is Nadhim Zahawi of the Conservative Party. It is included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament, following the 2014 elections the seven members are; Philip Bradbourn OBE, (who died in December 2014) and Anthea McIntyre (Conservative), Neena Gill and Sion Simon (Labour) and Jim Carver, Bill Etheridge and Jill Seymour (UK Independence).\n\nThe soil is clay, gravel, and marl and the subsoil keuper marl. The area of the ecclesiastical parish is 2,933 acres.\n\nThe village has two churches. Situated on a hill to the north of the village is the old parish church of St Marys which is locally referred to as the Chapel. The oldest part of the building has been dated back to the 13th century but only the chancel of the original building now remains, to which a western porch has been added. There remain some ancient stained glass in the windows and some encaustic tiles in the floor. The font, of the 15th century, has an octagonal bowl with a moulded lower edge, and a plain stem. In the bowl one of the two staples remains. The memorials are to the Knights of Barrells Hall and a coloured memorial to Sir Francis Throkmorton who died in 1554 The roof and bell tower were still under restoration at the turn of the 2000 millennium but at a service attended by 80 parishioners on the morning of 1 January 2000 the old bell was made to \"ring in\" the 21st Century by throwing Golf balls into the bell tower. The balls were recovered some years later when the restoration was completed.\n\nThe modern church of St Mary is down in the village and was constructed in 1875 at a cost of £5,000 to an odd idiosyncratic design by John Pollard Seddon in the Early English style by the three Newton brothers of Barrells Hall and Glencripesdale Estate in memory of their parents William & Mary Newton.\n\nA significant local landmark is The Crowley Oak which can be located just outside the village heading towards the A435. It has ancient oak status according to the Woodland Trust and with a girth of over seven metres, it certainly makes an impressive sight at the roadside.\n\nThe Winged Spur public house, which stands in the centre of the village, was closed for a few months during early 2011 but reopened on 31 Oct 2011. It also has a tennis club and a village hall.\nRetired semi professional cricketer and legend Matthew ‘Badger’ Harvey who captained Solihull Blossomfield First XI with distinction is a resident of the village. He now plays as a key member of the side for Temple Grafton CC, single handedly saving them from relegation most seasons. His most famous achievements include hitting multiple centuries in match winning performances, removing 6 batsmen in 8 balls to win the game from an almost lost cause against a strong Tanworth side, claiming a first class wicket against Menorca CC, and hitting the biggest 6 in the Cotswold Hills Cricket League.\n\n"}

{"id": "2085485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085485", "title": "Australian Story", "text": "Australian Story\n\nAustralian Story is a national weekly current affairs and documentary style television series which is broadcast on ABC Television. It is produced specifically by the ABC News and Current Affairs Department. The program first aired on the 29 May 1996, and since then it has continued to profile various Australian people, typically ones with a diverse background or notable reputation. \n\n\"Australian Story\" tends to explore themes such as ‘heroic achievement’, ‘taking a stand’ and ‘human weakness’ . The episodes are known to frame people or situations in a sympathetic light. This personal approach to story-telling has been well received by many, with the program winning many awards including multiple Walkley Awards for excellence in journalism and four consecutive Logie Awards (2003-2006). As of 2013, it attracted an average audience of more than one million viewers each week, making it one of the most popular programs on ABC Television.\n\n\"Australian Story\" is a weekly half hour program which airs on Monday’s at 8:00pm (AEST). The program is categorised as a documentary style current affairs program. This hybrid categorisation is a result of the program’s decision to present newsworthy stories without the presence of an onscreen reporter. Instead, the program aims to have subjects tell their own stories in their own words. \n\nEach week the program presents a story relating to a notable Australian figure. These are referred to as profiles and they convey subjective experiences. Profiles account for both Australian celebrities and lesser known more ordinary Australians. The program has an intimate approach to storytelling . The subjects are filmed in relevant environments such as their respective home or workplace. Profiles also include footage of and confessionals made by relevant family and friends . Each profile on average, is filmed over a period of 10-12 days, and each episode has an eight-week turnaround.\n\nIn 1996 the ABC restructured its current affairs program \"The 7:30 Report,\" turning separate state editions into one centralised national program. As a result, \"The 7:30 Report\" had less scope for localised, human interest stories. ABC in Brisbane established \"Australian Story\" as a result of the restructuring, and they were given a remit for rural coverage . The program began screening on the 29 of May 1996 .\n\n\"Australian Story\" was initially supposed to be a series of small magazine-style stories. It quickly started focusing on one single story for each episode, this is the format it still uses today. Given it was shot predominantly outside of a studio and always without the presence of a reporter, \"Australian Story\" was originally considered to be a novelty current affairs program. Other unconventional elements included their camera work and pacing which were considered to be slow and cinematic. These characteristics of the show contribute to its classification as a documentary. \n\nIn 2016 \"Australian Story\" celebrated it's 20th anniversary and broadcast a two-part special. The special acknowledged many notable stories covered since the program's inception, such as Hazel Hawke's Alzheimer's diagnosis, Australian actress Jacki Weaver's bought with alcoholism and Gail Shann's life in rural Queensland after losing her arms. The special revealed that over the span of 20 years \"Australian Story\" had covered over 800 stories.\n\nCaroline Jones was previously the program's presenter and would introduce the subject at the beginning of an episode. Occasionally a high-profile person would fill this role, such one off presenters included the likes of Matt Damon, Elton John and Dawn Fraser. Jones announced she was leaving \"Australian Story\" at the end of 2016. As a result of her departure, it was decided that episodes would no longer be introduced by a presenter.\n\nEpisodes of \"Australian Story\" have always aired on a Monday night at 8:00pm (AEST) on ABC TV. They are now also posted weekly to Youtube. In addition to this, episodes are made available via the Australian \"Story\" webpage and ABC iview . \n\n\"Australian Story\" has received criticism due to the fact that it does not belong solely to one genre. The program is classified by the ABC as a News and Current Affairs Program as well as a documentary series. \"Australian Story’s\" status as a documentary program though has been contested by Australian documentary filmmakers. This is because the program is a serial production made for a television network and from a formal broadcasting location. The program's status as a News and Current Affairs Program has also been questioned by academics who claim \"Australian Story\" exhibits a soft journalistic approach. Such critiques suggest the program has become a platform for people with high-profile stories who want to manage their image and the publicity surrounding it.\n\n\"Australian Story\" aired an episode on January 13 of 2006 entitled ‘The Road to Kerobokan’ . It detailed the story of Scott Rush, a 20-year-old Australian male who was on trial in Bali, Indonesia for his part in a heroin smuggling attempt. The episode aired only hours after Rush received a life sentence. Producers Helen Grasswill and Ruth Dexter chose not to disclose Rush’s previous criminal misdemeanours in the episode per legal advice. This was because such information could damage Rush’s appeal process. The episode still acknowledged that Rush had previous misdemeanours but did not detail them. The following morning on the 14 of February, the day after the \"Australian Story\" episode aired, the Queensland Courier-Mail published a front-page story with the headline ‘Mule had history of crime’ . This article exposed in more detail Rush’s prior drug offences. In response, an episode of ABC’s program \"Media Watch\" exposed that a negative sentiment was shared among many \"Australian Story\" viewers because the program had chosen not to disclose such information . As reported by Media Watch, Paul Toohey of Australian Magazine \"The Bulletin\" said ‘whatever that Australian Story was, it was not journalism’ . Such backlash has contributed to the idea that \"Australian Story\" is too soft on its subjects.\n\nIn 2010, \"Australian Story\" aired a two-part profile entitled \"Something in the Water\", broadcast on the 15 and 22 of February. The profile was on Alison Bleaney, a doctor and member of local council in the Tasmanian town of St Helens. Bleaney raised concerns about links between forest industry practices and the supposed presence of toxins in Tasmanian waterways. The episodes aired during the Tasmanian State election campaign, and garnered political attention. Accusations arose after the episodes aired, that they had been deliberately broadcast during the 2010 Tasmanian State Election campaign, in order to influence the result. Deborah Fleming who was \"Australian Story’s\" executive producer at the time responded to such criticism by saying that the program had sought only to report concerns rather than facts. Although past public surveys have revealed that Australians rely on the ABC News and Current Affairs Department as a source of trustworthy political information. It is expected that when this department gives an issue in-depth attention, it will become legitimated and treated as a current affair rather than solely a human interest story. Because of this, \"Something in the Water\" came under scrutiny with critics arguing it should have been more scientifically credible.\n\nIn 2002, \"Australian Story\" aired a profile on the former Australian Governor-General and Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane Dr Peter Hollingworth. The episode was entitled \"The Gilded Cage\". This was a notable episode because \"Australian Story\" had the exclusive interview with Hollingworth after a major school sex abuse scandal he had inadvertently played a part in. Whilst Hollingworth was Archbishop there were two serial pedophiles active in three Brisbane Anglican schools and the way he handled the situation was widely deemed across Australia as inappropriate. In \"The Gilded Cage\" Hollingworth implied that a 14 year old girl was the one to initiate the sexual relationship she had with a Priest. These comments were met with controversy from the Australian public and he eventually resigned from his position as Governor-General over the matter . The candid and confessional nature of the interview served \"Australian Story's\" reputation as being a provider of real and personal stories. \n\n\"Murder He Wrote\" is a notable \"Australian Story\" profile as it was the program's first ever two-part profile, spanning over two episodes . Prior to this profile \"Australian Story\" had never dedicated more than one episode to a story. The episodes were broadcast respectively on the 29 of July 2002 and the 5 of August 2002. They detailed the story of John Button, a man from Western Australia who was wrongfully convicted of murder. Button had been convicted of killing his girlfriend Rosemary Anderson, but the case was reopened when he appealed the conviction and attributed her death to the very high-profile serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke. Producer of these episodes, Wendy Page, had researched the case for 6 years before pursuing the story. Herself and Ian Harley won the Walkley Award for 'Current Affairs, Feature, Documentary more than 10 minutes' with this profile . \"Australian Story\" interviewed members of the Button, Anderson and Cooke families throughout the appeal process. The profile concluded with Button’s exoneration, his case was one of the longest-standing convictions to be overturned in Australia's legal history. \n\nIn 2004 on the 1st of November, \"Australian Story\" aired the first episode of a two-part profile entitled \"Into the Forest\". This two-part profile explores the crimes of infamous Australian serial killer Ivan Milat. In Part 1, \"Australian Story\" spoke to Milat's younger brothers Bill and Richard, older brother Boris and sister-in-law Caroline as well as Clive Small who was the NSW Police Superintendent whilst Milat's case was open. According to Screen Australia this episode was the number 1 top rated Australian documentary on television in 2004. Producers Ben Cheshire and John Stewart won the TV Week Logie Award for ‘Most Outstanding Public Affairs Programme’ for this profile.\n\n\"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\" was \"Australian Story’s\" first ever three-part profile with three episodes broadcast in 2006 on the 17 of July, 24 of July and 31st of July. The case generated heated public debate and was of great interest to The Australian public at the time. It followed three men, Fazzari, Pereiras and Martinez who had been convicted for the murder of Phillip Walsham in 1998 . The episodes focus heavily on Mirella Scaramella, the girlfriend of Fazzari and her efforts to fight the verdict. A year following this \"Australian Story\" profile, the three men were exonerated by the Western Australia Court of Appeal .\n\nThe \"Australian Story\" special entitled \"Unbreakable\" detailed the experience of competitor Garry Robinson who managed to survive a Black Hawk helicopter crash in Afghanistan in 2010 and went on the compete in the Invictus Games. The episode is notable because it attracted a complete audience of 2 million people. Most episodes generally garner an audience of 1 million people. \"Unbreakable\" aired on Monday the 15th of October, 2018\". Australian Story\" spoke exclusively to Prince Harry throughout this episode, as he is the founder of the Invictus Games. He was interviewed from inside Kensington Palace.\nIn April 2014, \"Australian Story\" broadcast a two-part profile on Australian media mogul Kerry Packer . The profile detailed the life of Kerry Packer who had died in 2005 after a long and highly influential career. Part two of this profile garnered the highest average audience for 2013-14, with 1.6 million viewers. The profile was of great interest to Australians as it included interviews with particularly powerful men such as John Howard, Malcolm Turnbull and Richard Walsh. The profile also included an interview with Jodhi Meares, Packer's former daughter-in-law, who had never before spoken out about her experience being a part of the Packer family.\n\n\n"}

They were a development by Frederick Hawksworth of Charles Collett's earlier Hall Class named after English and Welsh country houses.\n\nAlthough the GWR had been at the forefront of British locomotive development between 1900 and 1930, the 1930s saw a degree of complacency at Swindon reflected in the fact that many designs and production methods had not kept pace with developments elsewhere. This was especially true with the useful GWR 4900 Class, the design of which largely originated in the 1900s and had not fundamentally changed since the mid-1920s. Charles Collett was replaced as the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Railway by F.W. Hawksworth in 1941 who immediately created a modified version of the design, known as the 'Modified Hall Class'.\n\nThe Modified Halls marked the most radical change to Swindon Works' practice since Churchward's time as chief mechanical engineer and was very far from a simple modification of the Hall design. 'Although in outward appearance it looked almost the same, nearly everything about it was new.' Hawksworth's use of plate frames throughout the design was a break with Churchward's practice for 2 cylinder locomotives. The cylinders were cast separately from the smokebox saddle and bolted to the frames on each side. A stiffening brace was inserted between the frames and extended to form the smokebox saddle. The exhaust pipes leading from the cylinders to the blastpipe were incorporated into this assembly.\n\nAdditionally, Churchward's bar framed bogie which had been adapted for the original Hall prototype in 1924 was replaced by a plate frame structure with individual springing. There were changes, too, above the running board. Hawksworth decided that the declining quality of coal reaching Great Western depots necessitated a higher degree of superheating. A larger three-row superheater and header regulator were fitted into Swindon No.1 boiler. Improvements were subsequently made to the draughting on some engines, while others were fitted with hopper ashpans.\n\nThe first batch of twelve Modified Halls was delivered from Swindon works between March and September 1944. They carried plain black livery were unnamed and numbered 6959-6970 (immediately following the Hall Class sequence). They were all subsequently named between 1946 and 1948.\n\nA further batch of ten locomotives appeared during October and November 1947 and others were on order when the nationalisation or Britain's railways took place in 1948. British Railways continued construction of this class until November 1950, by which time there were seventy-one examples.\n\nSome modified Halls were equipped with a flat, high-sided Hawksworth tenders. Once he became Chief Mechanical Engineer, many earlier locomotives also received these tenders so a Hawksworth tender does not necessarily mean a Hawksworth locomotive.\n\nThe Modified Hall class 'ran freely, steamed well and were popular with both footplate and maintenance staff. After the unambitious designs of Collett's final years, they restored Swindon's reputation.' Fourteen survived until the end of steam on the former GWR in 1965.\n\n\nSix Modified Halls have been preserved on various heritage railways. A seventh survivor no 7927 \"Willington Hall\" is being used as a donor for the Grange and County re-creation projects.\n\nOut of the six engines to be preserved, five engines have run in preservation. The only engine yet to run is 6984 \"Owsden Hall\". Half of the class have also seen main line operation: Nos. 6960 \"Raveningham Hall\", 6990 \"Witherslack Hall\" and 6998 \"Burton Agnes Hall\". 6960 and 6998 saw main use in the 1980s, especially in 1985 when the locos were regularly used during the GW150 Celebrations. 6998 was a popular mainline performer in the late 1980s, and also in the 1990s, until 1996 when she was withdrawn from operation awaiting an overhaul. Four of the class are currently operational but since 6998 was withdrawn no Modified Halls have been seen running on the main line.\n\n"}

{"id": "2085536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085536", "title": "Inchgarvie", "text": "Inchgarvie\n\nInchgarvie or Inch Garvie is a small, uninhabited island in the Firth of Forth. Its name comes from \"Innis Garbhach\" which is Scottish Gaelic for \"rough island\". On the rocks around the island sit four caissons that make up the foundations of the Forth Bridge.\n\nInchgarvie’s fortifications pre-date the modern period. In the days when boats were the only way to cross the Firth of Forth, the island was on the main route between North Queensferry in Fife and South Queensferry in Lothian. This made it strategically important. Although now uninhabited, Inchgarvie has been inhabited throughout various periods of history. The first recorded time was in the late 15th century. \n\nLike nearby Inchmickery, its profile and colour makes it look like a small warship from a distance. It was armed with coast defence guns from 1901 until 1906, and again from 1908 until the 1930s.\n\nRecords of Danish attacks on nearby islands, particularly Inchcolm as well as Fife and Lothian may mean that it was used in some capacity by them.\n\nThe island was licensed by King James IV to John Dundas of Dundas with the power to build a fort on 20 March 1491. John Dundas did not build the castle, and James IV himself ordered a strong tower to be built in 1513.\n\nOn 8 March 1514 Margaret, the widow of William Dundas of Dundas, undertook to manage the completion of the fortress that James IV and her father-in-law had begun building on her island. From 23 December 1514, Charles Dennison, Captain of Inchgarvie managed and fed a large royal construction team. The master mason was John of Cumbernauld, with his \"servitor\" John Strathauchin, who directed eight other masons and ten labourers. Margaret, Lady of Dundas gave them two boats. Two 'serpentine' guns and guns from Colstone were placed on the island after a visit by artillery experts in July 1515, and the island was equipped with a \"blawing horne.\" There was also a chapel.\n\nThe fort was captured by Richard Brooke in the \"Galley Subtile\" on 6 May 1544 during an attack on Edinburgh and demolished a week later. The English commander Lord Hertford wrote that it would have been useful to garrison Inchgarvie, but his orders from Henry VIII would not allow it. In 1547, after the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, Inchcolm and Inchkeith were fortified by the English, and held for two years; it is possible that Inchgarvie was fortified at this period too.\n\nBetween 1519 and 1671, the castle was used as a prison, and in 1580 Inchkeith and Inchgarvie were made a place of exile for the plague-stricken by order of the Privy Council. On 6 September 1627, the Laird of Dundas was invited to meet the Privy Council at South Queensferry and discuss building a modern fort on the island. Like Inchkeith, Inchgarvie had a quarantine hospital, and a prison. Oliver Cromwell had this demolished.\n\nDuring the reign of Charles II as King of Scots, the island was subject to continued maintenance for defensive purposes. The island was inspected by Charles in 1651 before falling into disrepair after his army was defeated by Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester.\n\nIn 1707 the island is known to have been rented to Archibald Primrose, 1st Earl of Rosebery. In 1779, however, the island's fortifications were renewed once more, in response to the threat posed by John Paul Jones, American Naval Commander, who harassed British ships from a base in the Forth. These fortifications were never used in anger.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic period, the threat from the sea meant gun batteries were created in 1806.\n\nIn 1878 the foundations for Thomas Bouch's Forth Bridge were laid on Inchgarvie (and their bricks remain), but after the Tay Bridge Disaster, these plans were abandoned, and the island languished until the west end of the island was extended with a pier, and used as the foundation for one of the Forth Bridge's cantilevers. The island, due to its proximity to the bridge, was also used as a construction office for the bridge, as well as accommodation for its workers within the re-roofed castle buildings. Some of the stone from the former castle was used to help build the caissons of the Forth Bridge.\n\nThe island became of renewed importance to the security of the Firth of Forth at the beginning of the 20th century. It was armed with two 12-pdr guns in 1901, in conjunction with gun emplacements on the mainland to the north (at North Queensferry) and to the south (at Dalmeny). Although the island's guns were removed from the approved armament in 1906, they were re-instated in 1908. The number of guns was increased to four in the early months of the First World War. The island's guns were removed from the approved armament of the Forth in the early 1930s. The guns may have survived for drill and practice until the beginning of the Second World War, during which the island was armed only with machine guns. The island's defences were intended (until 1905) to cover the controlled minefield laid across the river and later to tackle fast-moving torpedo boats attempting to enter the naval anchorage above the Forth Bridge or to damage the lock gates of the Rosyth Dockyard.\n\nInchgarvie is of igneous origin, and partly made up of picrite. Studies of the landscape beneath the waters of the firth have revealed that the visible surface of Inchgarvie is only the top of a larger crag and tail structure similar in structure to Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile created by glacial action.\n\n"}

Scotland won the 2007 event, followed by Sweden in 2008 and Italy in 2009. The contract ran for 12 years; however, Mission Hills' Shenzhen resort no longer hosted the event. The event's organizer, the International Federation of PGA Tours, announced in 2010 that the World Cup would become a biennial event held in odd-numbered years. When the World Cup resumed in 2011, the tournament moved to another property owned by the Mission Hills company, Mission Hills Haikou, located on Hainan Island, a tournament won by the United States.\n\n\nIn addition to golf courses, Mission Hills also features the Mission Hills Spa, Mission Hills Resort, Country Club featuring the largest tennis centre in Asia with 51 courts, including a 3,000 seat stadium court, Mission Hills In Residence, many function Rooms, recreation facilities, Mission Hills Golf Academy, Mission Hills Golf Academy, and Mission Hills Golf Academy by Zhang Lianwei. 15 km², 216 holes, 2 clubhouses (the new Dongguan Clubhouse at 63,000 m²), 4 spa locations, a 5-star hotel.\n\nMission Hills Centreville is a large 5 billion RMB (US$793 million) new development located next to the golf courses. Termed a HOPSCA project, meaning Hotel, Offices, Parks, Shopping, Convention and Apartment complex. Built on an area of 500,000m², it features a 700-room 5-star hotel, IMAX theatre, exhibition halls, 200 retailers, an international school, 1,000 apartment homes and all surrounded by extensive parkland. It is intended to be the first high-end shopping mall in northern Shenzhen. It is expected to open in mid-2013.\n\nThe land on which this golf club was built was stolen from the people of Songyuanxia village, Guanlan township. First of all, the villagers were told that there was a government requisition order requiring the villagers to turn their land over to the government for the purpose of creating an orchard. Apparently, the order came from Ye Xuanping, son of Ye Jianying. Then once the land was handed over, somehow it came into the hands of a Thai Chinese. This happened during the time when a blind eye was turned to corruption.\nMission Hills Golf Club was established in 1992 and 1993 saw the opening of its public driving range. By February 1994, the People's Government of Shenzhen entered into an agreement with the International Golf Association, announcing that Mission Hills Golf Club would be the host venue for the 1995 World Cup of Golf - the first international golf tournament in China. That year, an estimated 30,000 fans lined the fairways to see the United States team of Fred Couples and Davis Love III win its fourth consecutive World Cup title by 14 strokes over Australia (Brett Ogle and Robert Allenby).\n\nSince its inception, Mission Hills Golf Club has hosted over 50 international matches and is regularly visited by dignitaries, royalties, celebrities, world business, and political leaders, and a steady stream of the world's greatest golfers, including Annika Sorenstam, Nick Faldo, Zhang Lianwei, Colin Montgomerie, Retief Goosen and Tiger Woods.\n\nYouth development at Mission Hills: New major grants and scholarships for young Chinese Golf Talents, announced by Chinese 'Mission Hills' and R&A in November 2018.\n\nThe vice president of the course is Tenniel Chu.\n\nMission Hills Golf Club sponsored the \"Mission Hills Cup\" football match between FC Barcelona and a Mission Hills Invitation XI, which was played at the Hong Kong Stadium on 10 August 2007.\n\n"}

In 2011, it evolved into \"7.30\", a revamped current affairs program.\n\n\"The 7.30 Report\" began on 28 January 1986, screening Tuesday to Friday evenings. The program extended to Mondays the following year.\n\nUntil the end of 1994 the program had separate editions for each state and territory, presented by Alan Carpenter, Mary Delahunty, Quentin Dempster, Trisha Goddard, Sarah Henderson, Genevieve Hussey, John Jost, Leigh McClusky, Kelly Nestor, and Andrew Olle. Kerry O'Brien took over as the presenter of the national program in 1995, with Maxine McKew serving as the main relief presenter until 2006.\n\nO'Brien remained the editor and presenter of the program from the time it went national. He announced in 2010 that he would be leaving at the end of the year. He presented his final edition of the program on 9 December 2010.\n\nIn February 1996, the Friday episode of the show was replaced with \"Stateline\", a similar show with a separate edition for each state and territory.\n\nThe ABC announced in December 2010 that the program would return in 2011 in a new form, under the name \"7.30\". The revamped program was first presented by Leigh Sales from Sydney. Chris Uhlmann was \"<nowiki>7.30'</nowiki>\"s first political editor and Canberra presenter.\n\nThe ABC also announced that Stateline would be folded into the \"7.30\" program. The change saw \"7.30\" extended to five nights a week, although Friday editions continued to be presented locally and focus on state affairs.\n\nThe program usually comprised several pre-recorded items and live interviews, focusing on issues of national or global significance. The program traditionally featured interviews with politicians.\n\nReporters in its last season included: Tracy Bowden, Matt Peacock, Andy Park, Sean Rubinsztein-Dunlop, Dylan Welch, Louise Milligan, Madeleine Morris, Conor Duffy, Sarah Whyte, David Lewis, Monique Schafter, Alex Mann, Michael Atkin(s), and political editor Sabra Lane.\n\nFormer reporters had included political editor Heather Ewart, Deborah Cornwall, Greg Hoy, Mark Willacy, Michael Brissenden, Murray McLaughlin, Mary Gearin, Mike Sexton, John Taylor, Peter McCutcheon, Paul Lockyer, Lisa Whitehead, Natasha Johnson, David Mark, Genevieve Hussey, Mark Bannerman and Jonathan Harley. Paul Lyneham also hosted \"The 7.30 Report\" for several years.\n\nUntil 2010, satirists John Clarke and Bryan Dawe presented a (usually) weekly mock interview covering a topical issue. Dawe played the interviewer, while Clarke played a prominent public figure but, unusually for satire, he deliberately made no attempt to imitate the appearance, voice, or mannerisms of the person he portrayed. When portraying Julia Gillard he placed a flower pot behind him to give the impression of him being a woman. These interviews were a continuation of the pair's work for \"A Current Affair\", beginning in 1989, for which they won a number of awards.\n\n\n"}

He is also a member of Golden Smog.\n\nMurphy was the secondary songwriter in Soul Asylum, with Dave Pirner responsible for writing most of the band's material. Some of Murphy's solo writing credits include \"Can't Go Back\" from \"Made to Be Broken\", \"Cartoon\" off \"Hang Time\" and \"Gullible's Travels\" from \"And the Horse They Rode in On\". Additionally, he and Pirner co-wrote \"Easy Street\" which appeared on \"And the Horse They Rode in On\", and he co-wrote \"Promises Broken\" off \"Let Your Dim Light Shine\" with Marc Perlman.\n\nIn 1988, Murphy formed Golden Smog, a Minneapolis supergroup made up of members of The Replacements, The Jayhawks and Run Westy Run. Murphy was credited as 'David Spear' on the group's second album, \"Down by the Old Mainstream\", because of contractual obligations.\n\nIn 1992, Murphy appeared on the debut solo album by former Replacements drummer Chris Mars, \"Horseshoes And Hand Grenades\".\n\nSoul Asylum's success in the early 1990's gave Murphy the funds to start collecting pin-up art.

{"id": "2085577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085577", "title": "Corstorphine", "text": "Corstorphine\n\nCorstorphine ( ) is a village and parish to the west of Edinburgh, now considered a suburb of that city.\n\nCorstorphine retains a busy high street with many independent small shops, although a number have closed in recent years since the opening of several retail parks to the west of Edinburgh, especially the Gyle Centre. Traffic on the main street, St John's Road, is often heavy, as it forms part of the A8 main road between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The actual \"High Street\" itself is no longer the main street, an anomaly shared with central Edinburgh.\n\nFamous residents have included Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, Bible translator Alexander Thomson and Scottish Renaissance author Helen Cruickshank. Corstorphine is also featured in Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novel \"Kidnapped\" and mentioned in Danny Boyle's 1996 film \"Trainspotting\".\n\nEdinburgh Zoo is situated to the south-east of Corstorphine, and is the area's largest and most popular tourist attraction.\n\nCorstorphine has one of Scotland's best-preserved late medieval parish churches, Corstorphine Old Parish Church, with a short tower and spire and several well-preserved stone effigies of the local noble family, the Forresters of Corstorphine. The church of St Thomas houses a lively evangelical Episcopalian congregation.\n\nClose to Corstorphine Old Parish Church is Corstorphine public library.\n\nCorstorphine Hill is one of the so-called \"Seven Hills of Edinburgh\". Queen Margaret University's main campus was located there from 1970 until 2007, when the university moved to Musselburgh.\n\nThe earliest known form of the name is \"Crostorfin\", recorded in 1128. This possibly means 'Torfin's crossing'; in ancient times, much of the land in the area consisted of small lochs and marshes, with Corstorphine situated at an ideal crossing point. The identity of Torfin is not certainly known, but he was likely a local baron who commanded a stronghold by the crossing. The name is a Gaelicised version of the Norse name \"Thorfinnr\", and was popular in Scotland around 1000.\n\nA popular legend, now widely discredited, states that a 'cross of fine gold' was presented to the church by a Norman baron, and thus the village came to be known as \"croix d'or fine\".\n\nOld Corstorphine stood on a piece of dry land, between two lochs, the Gogar Loch and Corstorphine Loch, though both have now been drained.\n\nThe first noticed proprietors of Corstorphine were David le Mareschall, in the reign of Alexander II, and Thomas le Mareschall and William de la Roche, whose names occur in Ragman Rolls of 1296. The estate remained in the possession of the families of Thomas le Mareschall and William de la Roche until the reign of David II, when it was forfeited by David le Mareschall and given by the King to Malcolm Ramsay. It was next held by William More of Abercorne, who left it to his brother, Gilchrist More, who sold it to Adam Forester.\n\nAn important family in the area were the Lords Forresters, whose name has been given to several streets and whose large house can still be seen on Corstorphine High Street. Their main home, Corstorphine Castle, a 14th-century stronghold, was in ruins by the end of the 18th century and does not exist today. The only remnant of the castle is the 16th century doocot () which stands alongside Dovecot Road and a commemoration in a street name, Castle Avenue.\n\nThe lands and Barony of Corstorphine have long been associated with the Forrester family. The first firm link with Corstorphine comes with Adam Forrester a wealthy burgess of Edinburgh in the 1360s when he began to acquire land in the vicinity.\n\nBetween 1374 and 1377 King Robert II confirmed Adam Forrester in the lands of the Lordship of Corstorphine, which had previously been owned by William More of Abercorn. Forrester founded a chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist, connected to the parish church of Corstorphine.\nSir John Forrester, who succeeded his father upon his death, was granted various lands, mostly in West Lothian, in 1426 which were united into the barony of Liberton. In Perth on 4 February 1431 James I confirmed him in the house and lands of Corstorphine, which would be thereafter known as the Barony of Corstorphine. He likely founded the Corstorphine Collegiate Church in 1429, which forms part of today's parish kirk. Sir John is thought to have died in 1448 and was buried in Corstorphine Kirk, where recumbent effigies of him and one of his wives survive. He had four children: John, Henry, Elizabeth, and Janet.\n\nWilliam Dunbar mentions a poet, \"Roull of Corstorphin\" in his \"Lament for the Makaris\" c.1505. Little else is known of the poet Roull, though one poem by him may be extant. Stewart Conn, Edinburgh's first appointed Makar, has celebrated Roull's memory in his volume \"Ghosts at Cockcrow\".\n\nThe title then fell to his eldest son John, who is believed to have been more of a soldier than a civil servant. In 1443 he was with the Earl of Douglas when he destroyed Barnton castle, a stronghold of the Crichtons. As a direct consequence Forrester's house at Corstorphine was razed. He died in 1454 and was buried in Corstorphine Kirk, where his tomb can still be seen.\nJames Forrester of Corstorphine (son of the previously mentioned James Forrester), husband of Janet Lauder, was confirmed by Mary, Queen of Scots, on 5 February 1556 in the Barony of Corstorphine. In 1577 Sir James presented the parish kirk with a bell for its steeple. This bell still survives, although it was renewed in 1728.\n\nOn 22 October 1599 Henry Forrester of Corstorphine sold various lands within the parishes of Corstorphine and St Cuthbert's. Henry died sometime around 1615 and his eldest son George became laird. James VI had already confirmed George Forrester, son and heir apparent of Henry Forrester of Corstorphine, and his wife Christine Livingstone in various properties in the barony of Corstorphine, on 15 November 1607.\n\nAt Holyrood House on 30 July 1618 King James confirmed Sir George Forrester of Corstorphine in the lands and barony of Corstorphine. On 22 July 1633 he was created Lord Forrester of Corstorphine by Charles I. Lord Forrester had no sons, so resigned most of his properties, including Corstorphine, in favour of James Baillie.\n\nDuring the mid-17th century the family seems to have experienced some financial problems which resulted in lands being temporarily out of their control. On 3 August 1663 the lands and Barony of Corstorphine, except for the castle of Corstorphine and the town of Corstorphine, were granted to Sir John Gilmour. Oliver Cromwell had granted Laurence Scott of Bavelaw and his wife Katherine Binning, the lands, Lordship and Barony of Corstorphine, tower, manor-place, mills, mill-lands, parsonage etc., in lieu of the money due by James, Lord Forrester, to Beatrix Ramsay in Corstorphine who had assigned the debt to the said Laurence Scott, 1654. On 5 August 1664 the lands, Lordship and Barony of Corstorphine formerly belonging to James, Lord Forrester, and his brother German William Baillie which had been taken in lieu of debt, were granted to Florentius Gardner, baillie of Grangepans.\n\nOn 10 May 1666, land was similarly granted to John Boyd, merchant burgess of Edinburgh. The Forresters soon reacquired much of their lands around Corstorphine.\n\nJames Baillie's first wife Johanna died early. He then married Janet Ruthven, daughter of the Earl of Forth. This latest Lord Forrester was a man of dubious morals and seduced his niece, the wife of an Edinburgh burgess James Nimmo. She, however, later quarrelled with Forrester and stabbed him to death in his garden at Corstorphine on 26 August 1679. Mrs Nimmo was later executed at the Cross of Edinburgh for the murder. The titles then fell to William, the son of his brother William Baillie and his wife Lillias, daughter of the first Lord Forrester.\n\nIn 1698, the estate of Corstorphine was sold to Hugh Wallace of Ingliston, a Writer to the Signet. In 1713, he sold it to Sir James Dick of Prestonfield, in whose family it remained until 1869. The Dicks were a prominent family of lawyers and merchants in Edinburgh. Sir James Dick (1643–1728) was a merchant and baillie of Edinburgh and also served as Dean of Guild and later as Lord Provost.\n\nThe Register of the Great Seal records the transfer of the lands and Barony of Corstorphine to Sir James Dick on 2 June 1713.\n\nUnlike some other areas of Edinburgh, Corstorphine escaped widespread industrialisation in the 19th century. It only started to be absorbed into the Edinburgh urban area in the mid-20th century. But even before then, it had started to transform into a middle-class dormitory area for Edinburgh workers. By the late 20th century, Corstorphine had an ageing demographic. In 1961, Queen Margaret College (now QMU) obtained land up on the edge of Corstorphine next to Clermiston, and set up a campus there. This was closed in 2007, when they moved all their facilities out to Musselburgh.\n\nBefore Edinburgh's roads were improved, Corstorphine was on a major route from central Edinburgh to Glasgow (hence the name \"Glasgow Road\" in the west of Corstorphine). However, Corstorphine has failed to integrate its retail sector, and by building a large retail park, many of its small businesses have fallen by the wayside, and been mostly replaced by charity shops.\n\nThere are two rugby clubs based in Corstorphine: Corstorphine Cougars RFC and Forrester RFC. Because of its proximity to Murrayfield Stadium, Corstorphine picks up much of the passing trade from rugby internationals and this helps support the local hotels and pubs.\n\nThe local football club is Beechwood FC who play at Gyle Park pitches and at Tall Oaks. These are two of a number of football grounds in the area. There are also two tennis centres at St.Margaret's Park and on Belgrave Road.\n\nRH Corstorphine Cricket Club play home games at the Royal High School in Davidson's Mains.\n\nThere are also two golf clubs based at Carrick Knowe nearby, and also another over on the other side of Corstorphine Hill. Corstorphine Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1902. The club and course disappeared in the late 1920s. The area once occupied by the course now forms part of Edinburgh Zoo.\n\nCorstorphine has its own tennis club, which is over a hundred years old., and there are additional tennis facilities at the David Lloyd Centre in Gyle Park, and at the nearby Murrayfield Tennis Club.\n\nIn the area is Corstorphine Primary School, a state school catering for children between typically 5–12 years of age. There are also several other state primary schools near Corstorphine: Carrick Knowe Primary School, East Craigs Primary School, Fox Covert Primary School, Fox Covert Roman Catholic Primary School, Gylemuir Primary. The state secondary school that serve the area are Craigmount High School, which is situated between Corstorphine and East Craigs, and the nearest Roman Catholic secondary school is St. Augustine's, which shares a campus with Forrester High School.\n\nCorstorphine contains one of the busiest routes out to the west, and Glasgow Road's name reflects its former connection to that city. St John's Road, the main street in Corstorphine rather than the High Street, has been consistently rated as among the most polluted in Scotland. Lothian buses has introduced low-emission buses to try and deal with this problem. Large sections of this main road have been turned into bus lanes where the road is wide enough. Cycling routes run mainly from east to west as the topography is dominated by the ridge of Corstorphine Hill\n\nThe area is served by a number of buses operated by Lothian Buses including route numbers 1, 12, 21, 26, 31, as well as the airport buses, the 100 & 200.\n\nOther companies also run bus routes through Corstorphine, including First Buses, and also CityLink.\n\nThe Corstorphine and Pinkhill railway stations were closed to passenger service in 1968, but some of the track bed remains and is used as a footpath and part of the cycle network. The nearest extant railway stations are at Edinburgh Gateway and South Gyle, and slightly further away, Haymarket.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The reason for this is because of all the camps and student experiences in the Mannix campus (Year 9).\n\nSalesian is a member of the Associated Catholic Colleges.\n\n\nThroughout years 7 to 11, weekly sporting activities are conducted and compulsory to students in those year levels. The college also offers a number of other sporting clubs, teams, trips and activities.\n\nThis sporting ethos is heavily embedded in the school life and has allowed the school to compete with many of the larger schools in the ACC.\nSalesian has also gone back to the housing system of competitive sport in the school at the beginning of 2007. The four houses compete with each other in many sports, most notably swimming and athletics.\n\nSalesian Old Boys Cricket Club is a cricket club situated at the college. It currently hosts a Juniors Academy and several junior and senior teams. The club currently plays under the Southern Districts and Churches Cricket League.\n\nThe Mannix Campus is a special campus, a state-of-the-art facility, dedicated to the education of students in year 9.

A host of various styles of bands are offered to the students to suit their needs. These bands will play often throughout the year in many of the college's assemblies, masses, plays and other music activities. The college bands have also been involved in many other major events including: Olympic Torch Relay, The ACC \"ACCent on Music\" inaugural concert, State Ministerial performances, the College's Annual Dinner Dance, Band Festivals and Eisteddfods. An annual band camp is also held during the year for the students involved. To encourage new students to begin an instrument, a free semester of music tuitions is given as part of the year 7 students curriculum. Once completed, students may elect to continue or change their preferences.\n\nThe Bosco program is a unit of study for Year 9 students that educates them about the environment, urbanism, community service and personal development. This gives the students a chance to explore the city and the environment of the community. Every Friday students are taught skills necessary for life, such as using Melbourne's Public transport system. They engage in hands-on activities that the students regard as \"fun\" and a \"wonderful learning experience\".\n\nThe Biretta program is an educational curriculum which was introduced to cater for boys with high intelligence. It does this through the implementation of challenging mental tasks, designed especially to promote growth in such areas. It began during 2010 and is still ongoing. The Biretta program is especially aimed at boys that don't want to go through the chaos of a standard classroom. .\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1826 he attended and graduated from Davidson Academy. Two years later, he was admitted to the Tennessee Bar. George C. Childress studied law for two years later he became chief editor for the \"Nashville Banner\" which he remained for 10 years. \n\nAfter spending some time raising money and volunteers in Tennessee for the Texas army, Childress left permanently for Texas. He arrived at the Red River on December 13, 1835, then illegally crossed the Red River into the nation of Mexico in violation of the Law of April 6, 1830. He reached Robertson's Colony on January 9, 1836. The following February he and his uncle, Sterling C. Robertson, were elected to represent Milam Municipality (formerly known as Viesca) at the Convention of 1836. Childress called the convention to order and subsequently introduced a resolution authorizing a committee of five members to draft a Declaration of Independence. Upon adoption of the resolution, he was named chairman of the committee by Richard Ellis (the other members of the committee were Edward Conrad, James Fannin, Bailey Hardeman, and Collin McKinney). The committee finished the drafting in only one day, leading many to believe that Childress had gone to the convention with a draft already prepared (as such, Childress is almost universally acknowledged as the primary author of the document and a newspaper article for his brother Wyatt's memorial states George wrote it in his brother's blacksmith shop).\n\nThe convention approved the document on March 2, 1836. The document is modeled closely on the United States Declaration of Independence, where most of the signatories had moved from, often illegally. Although the document is dated March 2, the actual signing took place on March 3, after errors were discovered when it was read. On March 19, 1836, Childress and Robert Hamilton were sent to the United States to gain recognition of the new Republic of Texas. They were later replaced by James Collinsworth and Peter W. Grayson.\n\nOn June 12, 1828, he married Margaret Vance. Seven years later, she gave birth to a son, but died from complications a few months afterward.\n\nOn December 12, 1836, Childress married Rebecca Stuart Read Jennings. This union produced two daughters.\n\nIn despair at the loss of his law practice, on October 6, 1841, while living in Galveston, Childress took a Bowie knife and committed suicide by cutting open his abdomen.\n\nChildress County, Texas is named in his honor. The city of Childress, Texas is named in his honor. In 1936, the year of the Texas Centennial, the state erected a statue of Childress in Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas.\n\n"}

{"id": "2085633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085633", "title": "Azacitidine", "text": "Azacitidine\n\nAzacitidine (INN; trade name Vidaza) is a chemical analog of cytidine, a nucleoside in DNA and RNA. Azacitidine and its deoxy derivative, decitabine (also known as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine), are used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Both drugs were first synthesized in Czechoslovakia as potential chemotherapeutic agents for cancer.\n\nAzacitidine, marketed as Vidaza, is used mainly in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, for which it received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 19, 2004. In two randomized controlled trials comparing azacitidine to supportive treatment, 16% of subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome who were randomized to receive azacitidine had a complete or partial normalization of blood cell counts and bone marrow morphology, compared to none who received supportive care, and about two-thirds of patients who required blood transfusions no longer needed them after receiving azacitidine.\n\nIt is also sometimes used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, as a hypomethylating agent; an oral version called CC-486 is being tested as an easier to administer treatment for AML.\n\nAzacitidine can be used \"in vitro\" to remove methyl groups from DNA. This may weaken the effects of gene silencing mechanisms that occur prior to methylation. Certain methylations are believed to secure DNA in a silenced state, and therefore demethylation may reduce the stability of silencing signals and confer relative gene activation.\n\nAzacitidine induces tumor regression on isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutant glioma xenografts in mice.\n\nIn research, 5-azacitidine is commonly used for promoting cardiomyocyte differentiation of adult stem cells. However, it has been suggested that this drug has a compromised efficacy as a cardiac differentiation factor because it promotes the transdifferentiation of cardiac cells to skeletal myocytes.\n\nAzacitidine also has antiviral effects in animal studies as well as its anti-cancer actions, but has not been tested for clinical use.\n\nAzacitidine is a chemical analogue of the nucleoside cytosine, which is present in DNA and RNA. It is thought to have antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms – at low doses, by inhibiting of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and at high doses, by its direct cytotoxicity to abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA, resulting in cell death. Azacitidine is a ribonucleoside, so it is incorporated into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. In contrast, decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a deoxyribonucleoside, so it can only incorporate into DNA. Azacitidine's incorporation into RNA leads to the disassembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and inhibition of the production of proteins. Its incorporation into DNA leads to covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequent leads to cytotoxicity. It has been shown effective against human immunodeficiency virus \"in vitro\" and human T-lymphotropic virus.\n\nAfter azanucleosides such as azacitidine have been metabolized to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-triphosphate (aka, decitabine-triphosphate), they can be incorporated into DNA and azacytosine can be substituted for cytosine. Azacytosine-guanine dinucleotides are recognized as substrate by the DNA methyltransferases, which catalyze the methylation reaction by a nucleophilic attack. This results in a covalent bond between the carbon-5 atom of the cytosine ring and the enzyme. The bond is normally resolved by beta-elimination through the carbon-5 atom, but this latter reaction does not occur with azacytosine because its carbon-5 is substituted by nitrogen, leaving the enzyme covalently bound to DNA and blocking its DNA methyltransferase function. In addition, the covalent protein adduction also compromises the functionality of DNA and triggers DNA damage signaling, resulting in the degradation of trapped DNA methyltransferases. As a consequence, methylation marks become lost during DNA replication.\n\nAzacitidine causes anemia (low red blood cell counts), neutropenia (low white blood cell counts), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), and patients should have frequent monitoring of their complete blood counts, at least prior to each dosing cycle. The dose may have to be adjusted based on nadir counts and hematologic response.\n\nIt can also be hepatotoxic in patients with severe liver impairment, and patients with extensive liver tumors due to metastatic disease have developed progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially when their albumin levels are less than 30 g/L. It is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors.\n\nKidney toxicity, ranging from elevated serum creatinine to kidney failure and death, have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for conditions other than myelodysplastic syndrome. Renal tubular acidosis developed in five patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (an unapproved use) treated with azacitidine and etoposide, and patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys, so patients with chronic kidney disease should be closely monitored for other side effects, since their levels of azacitidine may progressively increase.\n\nBased on animal studies and its mechanism of action, azacitidine can cause severe fetal damage. Sexually active women of reproductive potential should use contraception during while receiving azacitidine and for one week after the last dose, and sexually active men with female partners of reproductive potential should use contraception during treatment and for three months following the last dose.\n\nA study undertaken to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of a single-day exposure to Azacytidine (5-AzaC) on neurobehavioral abnormalities in mice found, that the inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-AzaC treatment causes neurodegeneration and impairs extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation and the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) protein expression in neonatal mice and induces behavioral abnormalities in adult mice, as DNA methylation-mediated mechanisms appear to be necessary for the proper maturation of synaptic circuits during development, and disruption of this process by 5-AzaC could lead to abnormal cognitive function.\n\nAzacitidine can also cause nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, redness at its injection sites, constipation, bruising, petechiae, rigors, weakness, abnormally low potassium levels in the bloodstream, and many other side effects, some of which can be severe or even fatal.\n\n\n"}

He was the father of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and of socialite Lee Radziwill, and was the father-in-law of John F. Kennedy.\n\nJohn Vernou Bouvier III was born in East Hampton, New York. His nickname, \"Black Jack\", referred to his perpetually dark-tanned skin and his flamboyant lifestyle.\n\nBouvier's great-grandfather, Michel Bouvier, was a French cabinetmaker from Pont-Saint-Esprit, in the southern Provence region. Michel immigrated to Philadelphia in 1815 after fighting in the Napoleonic Wars, married, was widowed, and then married Louise Clifford Vernou. \n\nIn addition to crafting fine furniture, Michel Bouvier had a business distributing firewood. To support that business, he acquired large tracts of forested land, some of which contained a large reserve of coal. Michel further grew his fortune in real estate speculation. His sons, Eustes, Michel Charles (M.C.), and John V. Bouvier Sr., distinguished themselves in the world of finance on Wall Street. They left their fortunes to their only remaining male Bouvier heir, Major John Vernou Bouvier Jr., who used some of the money to buy an estate known as Lasata in East Hampton, Long Island. \n\nMajor John Vernou Bouvier, Jr. (born 1866), a successful attorney, and Maude Frances Sergeant (born 1869) had five children, of whom John Vernou Bouvier III was the eldest. Their other children were William Sergeant \"Bud\" Bouvier, who was born in 1893 and died from alcoholism in 1929; Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale, who was born in 1895 and became the wife of Phelan Beale, Sr. and the mother of Edith Bouvier Beale, Phelan Beale, Jr., and Bouvier Beale; and twins Maude Reppelin Bouvier Davis and Michelle Caroline Bouvier Scott Putnam (born 1905).\n\nJohn Vernou Bouvier III attended Philips Exeter Academy and Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School. He then studied at Columbia University before transferring to the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. While attending Yale, he was a member of the Book and Snake secret society and the Cloister Club. He graduated in 1914.\n\nUpon his graduation, he went to work as a stockbroker at his father and uncle's firm: Bouvier, Bouvier & Bouvier. In 1917, he left the firm to join the United States Navy. When the Navy proved to be too strenuous , he transferred to the United States Army, where he served as a major. Bouvier was discharged in 1919, whereupon he went back to work as a stockbroker on Wall Street.\n\nBouvier married Janet Norton Lee, the daughter of real estate developer James T. Lee, on July 7, 1928, at St. Philomena's Church in East Hampton. They had two daughters, Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Bouvier (1929–1994) and Caroline Lee Bouvier (1933–2019). Bouvier's drinking, gambling, and philandering led to the couple's divorce in June 1940. Bouvier never remarried.\n\nIn June 1942, Janet Lee Bouvier married Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr. Janet reportedly did not want her ex-husband to escort his daughter, Jacqueline, down the aisle for her 1953 wedding to John F. Kennedy, so Jacqueline was instead escorted by her step-father. However, some reports indicated Bouvier was too intoxicated to escort his daughter, leading Auchincloss to step in to give the bride away.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Bouvier had sporadic contact with his daughters and family. He spent the majority of his time drinking alone at his New York City apartment located at 125 East 74th Street.\n\nIn the spring of 1957, Bouvier was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. He checked into Lenox Hill Hospital on July 27, 1957 to undergo chemotherapy. On August 1, he fell into a coma. He died two days later, on August 3, aged 66. His funeral, which was arranged by his daughters Jacqueline and Lee, was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan after which his body was buried in the Bouvier family plot at Most Holy Trinity Catholic Cemetery in East Hampton, New York.\n\nBouvier is thought to be the \"Wall Street Jack\" mentioned in the lyrics of \"Forty Second Street\", from the musical \"42nd Street\".\n"}

While the prosecution is not required to search for exculpatory evidence and must disclose only the evidence in its possession, custody, or control, the prosecution's duty is to disclose all information known to any member of its team, e.g., police, investigators, crime labs, et cetera.

It linked the quays at Wadebridge with the town of Bodmin and also to quarries at Wenfordbridge. Its intended traffic was minerals to the port at Wadebridge and sea sand, used to improve agricultural land, inwards. Passengers were also carried on part of the line.\n\nIt was the first steam-powered railway line in the county and predated the main line to London by 25 years.\n\nIt was always desperately short of money, both for initial construction and for actual operation. In 1847 it was purchased by the London and South Western Railway, when that company hoped to gain early access to Cornwall for its network, but in fact those intentions were much delayed, and the little line was long isolated.\n\nChina clay extraction was developed at Wenfordbridge and sustained mineral traffic on the line for many years, but passenger use declined and the line closed to passengers in 1967, the china clay traffic continuing until 1978.\n\nMuch of the route now forms part of the Camel Trail, a cycle and footpath from Wenfordbridge to Padstow\n\nLocal interests obtained parliamentary authority to construct the Bodmin & Wadebridge Railway from metal ore mines near Wenford to the port at Wadebridge for onward transport by coastal shipping. Sea sand, then used for improving agricultural land, was also to be brought up from Wadebridge. The line was also to have a branch to Bodmin and also a one-mile branch to Ruthern Bridge.\n\nThe line was formally opened on 30 September 1834 although trial operation, conveying revenue passengers and minerals had taken place in July. The permanent way consisted of 15 foot parallel rails 42 lbs per yard on stone blocks 20 inches square. The track gauge was the standard gauge.\n\nAt first there was only one locomotive, called \"Camel\", a single passenger coach, and desperately few wagons, but a second engine, called \"Elephant\" was obtained from June 1836.\n\nThe passenger service only ever operated between Bodmin and Wadebridge, and never on the branches; there were no intermediate stations, but boarding at any intermediate place was semi-officially permitted.\n\nThe train service seems to have been very irregular, probably because of mechanical problems with the locomotives, and for many years (probably from 1841) the passenger service consisted of a train from Wadebridge on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, returning on the other weekdays.\n\nMinerals and goods were the dominant traffic, and there were numerous wharves—the company used the term borrowed from canal operation, and the person in charge of each wharf was a wharfinger.\n\nWharves and siding connections were at:\n\n\nAlthough export of granite and the carriage of sea sand grew in volume, passenger traffic remained insignificant, and the line remained hopelessly weak financially, and a series of disasters including serious floods which damaged bridges and culverts, wiped out any small operating profit.\n\nIn the period from 1835, business interests in the Falmouth area were concerned to regenerate that town's waning importance, and railway connection to London was in their thoughts. Several proposals came forward and failed, but a scheme called the Cornwall & Devon Central Railway gained support for a standard gauge line following an inland route, forming an alliance with other lines to get access to London over the London & South Western Railway. The Cornwall & Devon Central company had yet to get parliamentary approval for construction, but it purchased the Bodmin & Wadebridge line for £35,000.\n\nIn fact the C&DC lost out in its bid for approval for its line, and the London & South Western company itself purchased the Bodmin & Wadebridge line for the same £35,000 from the C&DC company in 1847. The LSWR now owned a heavily loss-making little line more than a hundred miles from its own network. The purchase did not have parliamentary authority, and the purchase is often described as illegal. In fact the activities of companies incorporated by Act of Parliament were limited by the terms of the Act, and the LSWR did not have the power to acquire another railway company; their action in doing so would better be described as ultra vires.\n\nNotwithstanding the remoteness of the new owner, the LSWR brought financial resources to bear and the local line continued its operations with a little more certainty than previously, while still making considerable losses. However the Bodmin & Wadebridge continued to play a role in the battle between the LSWR and its allies, and the GWR and its satellites.\n\nSeveral nominally independent companies sought support and parliamentary powers for lines connecting with the Bodmin & Wadebridge; among these was the Launceston, Bodmin & Wadebridge Railway, which obtained its powers in 1864 but never succeeded in using them.\n\nIn 1873 the Devon & Cornwall Railway, a narrow gauge company, tried to obtain parliamentary authority to make extensions in the two counties in its name, including a railway from near Okehampton to Wenfordbridge, so as to gain access to Wadebridge; but this was rejected in Parliament.\n\nA new halt, called Shooting Range Platform, was opened about 1880. It was long enough for a single coach, located on the south-west side of the line; the shooting range was in the otherwise inaccessible land between the railway and the loop of the River Camel, opposite Derry's Wood. Trains stopped there only with written authority from the Army.\n\nIn 1882 an Act was passed for a railway called the North Cornwall Railway to build a line from Padstow via Wadebridge to Halwill, where the LSWR now had its line; running arrangements for the North Cornwall trains as far as Okehampton were agreed. The North Cornwall Company had wanted running rights as far as Exeter, but by now the LSWR sought friendlier terms with its rival, the GWR, and to avoid offending them, the powers were stopped short at Okehampton. There was to be a triangular junction at Pendevy Bridge, the point where the new Halwill line met the Bodmin & Wadebridge, a little east of Wadebridge, and the Act included powers to improve the Bodmin & Wadebridge line, including the making of seven deviations to eliminate the very sharp curves on the line.\n\nIn fact by an Act in 1883 the LSWR took over the role of making those improvements, and on 1 July 1886 the LSWR formally absorbed the Bodmin & Wadebridge line, the previous semi-legal purchase now being authorised by Act of Parliament of 25 June 1886.\n\nThe Great Western Railway had formed an alliance with other broad gauge railway companies in the West of England: the grouping was called the Associated Companies. In 1876 they amalgamated under the banner of the Great Western Railway, and that company pursued an active interest in developing railways in Cornwall. In earlier years the Associated Companies and the so-called narrow gauge companies—the LSWR and its allies—were hostile to one another, but now the enmity was abating.\n\nAn earlier proposal had been made to make a broad gauge line from the Cornwall Railway near Bodmin Road station to the Bodmin & Wadebridge station at Bodmin, with interchange platforms for the necessary transshipment from broad to standard gauge wagons there. This had been authorised by Act of Parliament in 1864, but was dropped in 1876.\n\nBy 1882 relations between the GWR and the LSWR had improved enough for constructive discussions to take place about connecting the GWR to Wadebridge, and to improve the Bodmin & Wadebridge line itself. (The line had been constructed with very sharp curves and lightly constructed track.) The Great Western Company got powers to make a standard gauge connection, and on 27 May 1887 the GWR opened a line from Bodmin Road to its own Bodmin station in the town. The station later became known as Bodmin General.\n\nIn the following year, on 3 September 1888 the GWR built an extension from their Bodmin station to join the Bodmin & Wadebridge line, at Boscarne Junction.\n\nThe LSWR now suspended its own passenger trains on the Bodmin & Wadebridge line from 1 November 1886 for the improvements to the line to be undertaken; goods trains were also suspended, and Great Western Railway trains were the only ones on the line, running from their own Bodmin station. In 1891 yet another Parliamentary Act was required to permit extension of time for these works, which still included the substantial easing of the sharp curves at Grogley and Dunmere, and substantial improvement of the whole of the section from Boscarne Junction to Bodmin (B&WR station), and extension of Wadebridge station.\n\nConstruction of the North Cornwall line from Halwill was much delayed due to difficulty in raising the necessary capital, and after several extensions of time it opened to a special goods train on 31 May 1895 and fully on 1 June 1895. The planned eastern arm of the triangular junction with the Bodmin & Wadebridge having been long forgotten. The North Cornwall converged with the Bodmin & Wadebridge line at Wadebridge Junction, about a mile east of Wadebridge itself.\n\nPadstow had to wait still further, and after yet another Act of variation the Wadebridge to Padstow section was opened to the public on 27 March 1899.\n\nOn 1 November 1895 the LSWR resumed running trains on the Bodmin & Wadebridge section, and therefore journeys from Waterloo to Bodmin, changing at Wadebridge, became feasible, taking from 7 hours 18 minutes to about 9 hours. The GWR continued its service of seven trains a day.\n\nTraffic on the line remained very light, and the LSWR installed class H13 steam railcars on the passenger trains; they seated 40 passengers. At the same time, intermediate halts were opened at Grogley Halt, Nanstallon Halt and Dunmere Halt on 2 July 1906. Mitchell and Smith also refer to a St Lawrence Hospital Platform, near the road to Nanstallon, opened in 1906 and closed in 1917. St Lawrence's Hospital is shown as \"County Lunatic Asylum\" on the 1908 Ordnance Survey map, but the Platform is not shown. The location must have been on St Lawrence Road.\n\nA second line was provided from Wadebridge Junction to Wadebridge, one line leading from the North Cornwall line and the other from the Bodmin line. The junction signalbox was abolished, and the two lines to Wadebridge were operated as two single lines. This arrangement applied from 4 February 1907.\n\nRuthern Bridge had originally been provided for several small mineral mines in the immediate area; but these declined in the twentieth century, and the last train ran on 29 November 1933, the ground frame connection to the main line being closed on 1 January 1934.\n\nThe Bodmin station was renamed Bodmin North on 26 September 1949; the GWR station was renamed Bodmin General. The B&W station was destaffed on 3 January 1966 and became a Halt on 18 April 1966—an unusual case of a terminal station being a halt.\n\nA modern clay drying works was built alongside the Wenfordbridge line just north of Poley's Bridge Road some time before 1962; china clay was piped as a slurry from Stannon Moor, over four miles away, and the dried product was conveyed away by train. \n\nFrom 1964 strict economies were to be made on the line, which after all had two train services from two different Bodmin stations. A new platform was opened on 15 June called Boscarne Exchange Platform; trains from Bodmin General to Wadebridge stopped here, and a diesel railbus operated a shuttle connection between there and the original Bodmin & Wadebridge station. The railbuses had steps to enable passengers to join and alight, so the \"platform\" on the B&W line was at ground level. There was no public access to and from the station, which was only for immediate transfer between the two trains. Oil lamps were provided—in 1964!\n\nIn 1966 the North Cornwall line between Halwill and Wadebridge was closed, and for a short period the Bodmin and Wadebridge trains were the only connection to Padstow.\n\nIn fact passenger services finished on 30 January 1967. Public goods facilities at Wenfordbridge were withdrawn on 1 May 1967, and the line became a dedicated branch for the china clay private sidings, gaining access to the railway network via Bodmin General (reverse) and Bodmin Road. The line closed in 1983.\n\nIn 1974 a preservation society was formed, which became the Bodmin and Wenford Railway. They have established a successful railway museum at Bodmin General, and run steam hauled passenger trains to Bodmin Parkway and to Boscarne. It is their aim to extend from Boscarne Junction to Wadebridge alongside the trail, on the route of the Bodmin and Wadebridge line.\n\nWhen the rolling stock came to be standardised with the rest of the network, the age of the route gave some difficulties. There was a trial of SECR P Class 0-6-0 on the line, which was a failure because of the lightly laid track and sharp curves, which made running difficult for locomotives not designed to accommodate it. As a result, three of the LSWR 0298 Class, Victorian locomotives designed for urban passenger duties, were retained on the line significantly past their life-expiry, and became an attraction in the far west for locomotive enthusiasts, being recorded as prodigious survivors as early as 1949 by C Hamilton Ellis. They were eventually replaced by GWR 1366 Class dock tanks in 1962 after the line had been transferred to the Western Region of British Railways.\n\n\n"}

Ditton is a local government ward, with a population of 6,249 at the time of the 2001 Census.\n\nIt has three small areas of shops (\"Alexander Drive\", \"St Michaels\" and \"Queens Avenue\") and the Roman Catholic St Michael's Church - a local example of Gothic Revival architecture. The area also houses two medium-sized industrial estates. There are three public-houses in Ditton; the Blundell Arms, the Yew Tree and the New Inn.\n\nTo the south east of Ditton runs Ditton Road, which connects the A562 Ashley Way Central Widnes By-pass to the Halebank area of the town. This an industrial stretch of road containing remnants of Widnes' manufacturing and trade, including a chemical plant and large timber yard which sit on an expanse of land which leads to the River Mersey. The area also once contained a popular golf course - St Michaels Municipal, however it closed due to arsenic contamination, which is a reminder of the industrial waste that lies beneath. Ditton railway station, situated on Hale Road between Ditton and Halebank, closed to passengers on 27 May 1994. The site is now a railway junction with concrete remnants of platforms. Near to the former station is Ditton Brook, which runs from the eastern part of Liverpool to Ditton, where it flows into the River Mersey. The River Ditton, runs through the area also flowing into the River Mersey.\n\nFrom 1968, and until, September 2004, a large Asda superstore with a petrol filling station occupied a site opposite just a few hundred yards up the road from the railway station.

Some years after the Senior Management buy-out of the company from Dalgety, the Widnes site was closed and production transferred to Scunthorpe. A large part of the workforce were Widnes-based, so the decline of the factory exacerbated the problem of unemployment for unskilled and semi-skilled workers in the area.

However, the Hermite interpolating polynomial may also be computed without using divided differences, see .\n\nUnlike Newton interpolation, Hermite interpolation matches an unknown function both in observed value, and the observed value of its first \"m\" derivatives. This means that \"n\"(\"m\" + 1) values\nmust be known, rather than just the first \"n\" values required for Newton interpolation. The resulting polynomial may have degree at most \"n\"(\"m\" + 1) − 1, whereas the Newton polynomial has maximum degree \"n\" − 1. (In the general case, there is no need for \"m\" to be a fixed value; that is, some points may have more known derivatives than others. In this case the resulting polynomial may have degree \"N\" − 1, with \"N\" the number of data points.)\n\nWhen using divided differences to calculate the Hermite polynomial of a function \"f\", the first step is to copy each point \"m\" times.

They are held in public trust and managed by the federal government. Pursuant to the Property Clause of the United States Constitution (, section 3, clause 2), the Congress has the power to retain, buy, sell, and regulate federal lands, such as by limiting cattle grazing on them. These powers have been recognized in a long line of U.S. Supreme Court decisions. \n\nThe federal government owns about 640 million acres of land in the United States, about 28% of the total land area of 2.27 billion acres. The majority of federal lands (610.1 million acres in 2015) are administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), or U.S. Forest Service (FS). BLM, FWS, and NPS are part of the U.S. Department of the Interior, while the Forest Service is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. An additional 11.4 million acres of land (about 2% of all federal land) is owned by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). The majority of federal lands are located in Alaska and the Western states.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has upheld the broad powers of the federal government to deal with federal lands, for example having unanimously held in \"Kleppe v. New Mexico\" that \"the complete power that Congress has over federal lands under this clause necessarily includes the power to regulate and protect wildlife living there, state law notwithstanding.\"\n\nLands held by the United States in trust for Native American tribes are generally not considered public lands. There are some 55 million acres of land held in trust by the federal government for Indian tribes and almost 11 million acres of land held in trust by the federal government for individual Natives. Although the United States holds \"legal title\" to these lands, the tribe or individual holds \"beneficial title\" (the right to use and benefit from the property). As a result, Indian Country is \"quasi-private, not public, land.\" Nevertheless, \"because the United States is a legal title holder, the federal government is a necessary part in all leases and dispositions of resources including trust land.

The largest single DOD-owned tract is the 2.3-million-acre White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.\n\nTogether, the BLM, FWS, NPS, Forest Service, and DOD manage 97% of federal land. Federal agencies that control smaller amounts of land include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the United States Postal Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nFederal land is concentrated in Alaska and the Western United States.

It is located in the Sivand valley and is mostly known for the nearby Sivand Dam. At the 2006 census, its population was 3,130, in 861 families.\n\nSivand has a warm climate and contains vast pastures. It has relatively dry winters with some occasional snowfall. Sivand is home to the Sivandi dialect, a north western -Iranian language which like an island is surrounded in a sea of other Persian languages and dialects in Fars. The number of Sivandi speakers is estimated to be approximately 6,800 persons. The population of Sivand decreased from some 6,000 in 1950 to its present total, as a result of most of its young population leaving for cities in pursuit of higher education; some Sivandis also emigrated, mostly to Europe and the United States of America. Most of Sivand's present inhabitants are involved in horticulture and farming.\n\n"}

These Protestant refugees fled Catholic persecution in France, emigrating to the Die Pfalz, the Rhenish Palatinate (in present day Germany), before going to New Netherland where they settled in Wiltwyck (present day Kingston, NY) and Nieuw Dorp, settlements midway between New Amsterdam (present day New York City) and Beverwyck (today known as Albany, New York) before ultimately founding New Paltz.\n\nLouis was the son of Chrétien du Bois and Françoise le Poivre of Wicres, and later Herlies, in Walloon Flanders, then part of Spanish Netherlands.\n\nThe 3rd part of Horton, \"The Memory of the Just is Blessed\", begins with an extract from a document in the Archives du Nord, and commentary:\n\nThe article seemingly demonstrates that the christening recorded 21 Oct 1626 at Wicres refers to Toussaint du Bois, not his brother Louis. Louis du Bois and his (apparent twin) brother Antoine were christened at Wicres 17 Jun 1622. Louis and Antoine appear to have been named after their paternal grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\nLouis fled persecution in France to Mannheim, Germany before 1650. Louis married Catherine Blanchan, in Mannheim, Germany on October 10, 1655. (Publication of Collections of the Ulster Historical Society –Ulster County Historical Society (Kingston, N.Y.), Ulster County Historical Society, Kingston, N.Y., ADDRESS of the Hon. A. BRUYN HASBROUCK, LL.D., delivered before the Society October 17th, 1859. Page XXXIV)\n\nLouis and Catherine had at least eleven children:\n\nThe DuBoises eventually moved to Kingston, New York within New Netherland around 1660, then to Hurley, New York. In 1663 the Esopus Indians captured DuBois' wife and three children who were eventually rescued three months later. According to legend but unmentioned in the detailed journal of the rescue expedition's commander, his wife, Catherine DuBois, was singing the about the Babylonian captivity when they were rescued. Louis DuBois was also physically attacked by the Indians, but fought back and survived.\n\nDuBois and the others bought a 40,000 acre tract of land from the Esopus Indians in 1677. The tract, known in 17th-century colonial New York as a \"patent,\" stretched from the Hudson River to the Shawangunk Mountains. DuBois was one of eleven men to begin settling on a rise over the Wallkill River, in the center of the patent, in 1678. Louis DuBois served as one of the original elders in New Paltz's French Reformed Church, which is still in existence today.\n\nIn the early years, DuBois and his fellow patentees governed the land communally. In 1728, the surviving patentees and their descendants created a more formal form a government called \"The Twelve Men\" (later known as the Duzine). This body consisted of one elected representative for each patentee families. Membership was restricted to their descendants through either male or female lines. To this date, some of the DuBois land is still owned by the family descendants. In 1785, the New York State Legislature confirmed the actions of this body. Although a standard form of town government was established in the late 18th century, the Duzine existed in at least ceremonial form into the 19th century. In the later years of the Duzine, the members were consumed with lawsuits defending the boundaries of the New Paltz patent. At one time, the Duzine hired Aaron Burr to represent them in such a lawsuit.\n\nLouis himself eventually returned to Wiltwyck, by then known as Kingston, where he died prior to his will entering probate on June 23, 1696. His widow remarried, and in her will freed two of her slaves.\n\nThe original settlement of Louis DuBois and his fellow patentees survives today as Historic Huguenot Street, a National Historic Landmark District. The site includes the DuBois Fort, a colonial stone house built by one of Louis' sons.\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois is said to be grandson of a loyalist descendant of Louis DuBois' brother who left for the West Indies. Most DuBois descendants supported the revolution, though, and now, descendants of the family's \"French father\" can be found in every state of the union.\n\nSome of the notable descendants of Louis DuBois include:\n\n"}
