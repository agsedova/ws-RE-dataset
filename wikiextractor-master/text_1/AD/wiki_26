{"id": "2217456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217456", "title": "Primicerius", "text": "Primicerius\n\nThe Latin term primicerius, hellenized as primikērios (), was a title applied in the later Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire to the heads of administrative departments, and also used by the Church to denote the heads of various colleges.\n\nEtymologically the term derives from \"primus in cera\", which is to say \"in tabula cerata\", the first name in a list of a class of officials, which was usually inscribed on a waxed tablet.\n\nFrom their origin in the court of the Dominate, there were several \"primicerii\" (\"primikērioi\" in Greek, from the 12th century usually spelled \"primmikērioi\"). In the court, there was the \"primicerius sacri cubiculi\" (in Byzantine times the \"primikērios\" of the \"kouboukleion\"), in charge of the emperor's bedchamber, almost always a eunuch. The title was also given to court officials in combination with other offices connected to the imperial person, such as the special treasury (\"eidikon\") or the imperial wardrobe (\"vestiarion\"). Other \"primicerii\" headed some of the \"scrinia\" (departments) of the palace, chiefly the \"notarii\" (\"notarioi\" or \"taboularioi\" in Byzantine sources).\n\nIn the Late Roman army, the \"primicerius\" was a rank junior to the \"tribunus\" and senior to the \"senator\". They are best attested in units associated with the imperial court, chiefly imperial guards. Thus in the 4th to 6th centuries there were the \"primicerii\" of the \"protectores domestici\" and of the \"Scholae Palatinae\", but also \"primicerii\" in charge of the armament factories (\"fabricae\"), which, like the \"Scholae\", where under the jurisdiction of the \"magister officiorum\". \"Primicerii\" are also to be found in the staffs of regional military commanders (\"duces\"), as well as in some regular military units. In the later Byzantine era, under the Komnenian emperors, \"primikērioi\" appear as commanders in the palace regiments of the \"Manglabitai\", \"Vardariōtai\", \"Vestiaritai\" and the Varangians.\n\nIn the late 11th century, the dignity of megas prim[m]ikērios (\"Grand Primicerius\") was established, which ranked very high in court hierarchy well into the Palaiologan period, where he functioned as a chief of ceremonies. \"Prim[m]ikērioi\" continue to be in evidence in the Byzantine Empire and the Despotate of Morea until their fall to the Ottomans.\n\nIn ecclesiastical use the term was given to heads of the colleges of \"Notarii\" and \"Defensores\", which occupied an important place in the administration of the Roman Church in Late Antiquity and in the Early Middle Ages.\n\nWhen young clerics were assembled in schools for training in the ecclesiastical service in the different districts of the Western Church (from the fifth or sixth century), the directors of these schools were also given this title. Thus, an inscription of the year 551 from Lyon mentions a \"\"Stephanus primicerius scolae lectorum servientium in ecclesia Lugdunensi\"\". Isidore of Seville treats of the obligations of the primicerius of the lower clerics in his \"Epistola ad Ludefredum\". From this position the primicerius also derived certain powers in the direction of liturgical functions.\n\nIn the regulation of the common life of the clergy in collegiate and cathedral churches, according to the Rule of Chrodegang and the statutes of Amalarius of Metz, the primicerius appears as the first capitular after the archdeacon and archpresbyter, controlling the lower clerics and directing the liturgical functions and chant. The primicerius thus became a special dignitary of many chapters by a gradual development from the position of the old primicerius of the \"scola cantorum\" or \"lectorum\".\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the title was used for the heads of the colleges of the \"notarioi\" and \"taboularioi\" in the Church bureaucracy, but also for the chief lectors, cantors, etc. of a church.\n\nIn modern usage of the Russian Orthodox Church, the word primicerius (\"primikirii\") is reserved for a junior cleric (sometimes a reader or subdeacon) holding a torch or a candle before officiating bishop during the divine service; usually he goes ahead in different pontifical processions, which may be an explanation for the choice of given word (the second part of the word in this case corresponds not to \"wax (of a tablet)\" but to \"candle wax\").\n\n"}

{"id": "2217462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217462", "title": "John Hardon", "text": "John Hardon\n\nJohn Anthony Hardon (June 18, 1914 – December 30, 2000) was an American Jesuit priest, writer, and theologian. He is recognized by the Catholic Church as a Servant of God\n\nJohn Anthony Hardon was born in 1914 to a devout Catholic family in Midland, Pennsylvania. When he was a year old, his 27-year-old father died in an industrial accident when the scaffolding collapsed under him as he moved to secure a steel beam dangling dangerously over his co-workers. After the accident Hardon was raised by his 26-year-old mother Anna (née Jevin) Hardon, who never remarried \"out of concern for the influence a possible stepfather might have on her son's vocation.\" They moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where they lived \"in the shadows of the iron and steel mills\". John Janaro, a biographer of Hardon, described Anna as \"a woman of deep faith, a Franciscan tertiary who embraced her poverty and her difficult circumstances with courage and grace.\" Anna \"attended daily Mass and received Holy Communion\" and her home \"had sacred pictures, a family holy water font, and a good deal of spiritual conversation.\" The Hardons could not afford a telephone and \"in fact they seldom bought a newspaper.\"\n\nHardon was Anna's only child, and she supported him by cleaning offices in Cleveland, often working nights. Janaro reports that as a child Hardon was \"willful and self-possessed; he was determined that no one was going to tell him what to do\"; but he was soon affected by his mother's devoted example. Hardon would often recall that his mother told him that she \"taught him to kneel before he could walk\" and the very purpose of knees \"are for kneeling to pray before God\". When he was four, Anna took him to his first all night vigil at Our Lady of Consolation parish in Carey, Ohio. She made a bed for him on the first pew, and prayed throughout the night on her knees as he slept. At the age of six he was instructed by a Sister Benedicta who told her students \"Whatever you ask Our Lord on your First Communion day, you will receive.\" That same year as he received First Holy Communion Hardon made a request to Jesus, \"Make me a priest.\" Thereafter the young Hardon attended daily Mass with his mother. At the age of eight he received the sacrament of Confirmation calling on the Holy Spirit to give him \"the grace of martyrdom.\"\n\nFor added income Hardon's mother took in two young Lutheran girls as boarders named Judith and Susan. Young Hardon at the age of three protested that he had to abstain from meat on Friday but the boarders, which he called his \"sisters\" did not. In response his mother gave the girls a choice saying \"My boy is growing up: he's asking embarrassing questions. Would you mind either abstaining from eating meat on Friday or find yourselves somewhere else to board?\" The girls choose to abstain. After having them get permission from their minister they were included in the fast. It was this early relationship with these borders who were \"staunch Lutherans\" (who lived with them for at least eight years) that Hardon would later cite as affecting his thinking, recalling in later life \"Years before the Ecumenical Movement I had come to respect and cherish Protestants.\"\n\nHardon excelled in schooling and was often at the top of his classes at St. Wendelin School (which he had to walk two miles to reach). His ability to hold the attention of a crowd was seen early when in sixth grade he gave a one-man show to his class entitled \"Pockets\" and \"For one solid hour he kept the audience laughing with his explanations of what he carried in his pockets.\"\n\nDuring a Church History class in eighth grade Hardon was inspired on hearing about the preaching of St. Peter Canisius, a Jesuit priest in the 16th century who combated the Protestant Reformation in Germany. Through this Hardon became impressed with the Jesuit order.\n\nHis mother did not have the funds to send him to a Jesuit High School, so he attended the diocesan high school of Cathedral Latin 15 miles from his home where he was taught by the Brothers of Mary.\n\nWorrying about leaving his mother on her own Hardon did not seriously consider the priesthood immediately after high school. Upon graduation \"With the help of savings his mother had put aside specifically for his future\" he attended John Carroll University, a Jesuit university in a suburb of Cleveland. To travel there from his mother's home he had to ride the streetcar \"a distance of three to four hours daily.\"\n\nDuring his first two years of college, Hardon intended to become a medical doctor. At University, he came even more strongly under the influence of the Jesuits. Janaro writes:\n\nElizabeth Mitchell writes that \"under the guidance of his priestly adviser, Hardon began, in his third year of studies, to discern more clearly his own call to the priesthood\". It was LeMay who guided Hardon to change \"his course of studies to include Latin, philosophy, and college theology.\" Hardon continued his studies until he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from John Carrol University in 1936.\n\nIt did not appear that he would be able to join the Jesuits due to his mother's worsening health, whom he felt duty bound to look after. Seeking both to fulfill his duty to his mother and to serve others, he had applied and been accepted to Ohio State Medical School. While he felt that he did not have a vocation to the priesthood, Fr. LeMay, his Jesuit spiritual adviser, \"did not agree with John's assessment of his situation\" and held that \"John did indeed have a priestly vocation\". His mother, aware that his concern for her health was influencing his decision, told him that \"the very same God who was calling him would guard every hair on his mother's head.\" She also told him \"if the reason he was going to marry was so that she would not be alone without anyone to care for her, he was not to be concerned.\" Considering his dream of matrimony \"the thought of marriage and family was overwhelmed by a realization of the spiritual family that springs up around a priest who brings the life of Christ to so many people.\"\n\nHardon announced his decision to pursue the priesthood to a girl named Jo who had been his friend since grade school when they sat next to each other. They had been dating seriously and discussed marriage on several occasions and Hardon had \"weighed the possibility of becoming engaged.\" He broke the news to her at a restaurant in downtown Cleveland. Jo did not take the news well, breaking down in tears and crying throughout the meal. Hardon entered the Jesuit novitiate on September 1, 1936, \"breaking the heart of a girl he loved, and loved him in return.\"\n\nHardon's health difficulties continued he later recalled \"When I entered the Novitiate, in one month they put me in the hospital I thought they were gonna throw me out of the order.\" Hardon recovered and continued his studies.\n\nTwo months into his novitiate Hardon confessed to Fr. LeMay that he felt he had abandoned his mother when she needed him most. LeMay told him \"John, you belong in the Society of Jesus. What you are experiencing is a temptation. Put it out of your\nmind.\" To avoid further temptations Hardon continued regularly to correspond with his mother but scrupulously avoided visiting her for seven years until ordered to do so by his superior. Hardon was deeply affected by the accidental drowning of a fellow seminarian when a group of them were on a summer lakeshore vacation. As a result of this he refused to take vacations for the rest of his life.\n\nHaving entered the Society of Jesus as a novice on September 1, 1936 Hardon took a special interest in theology and teaching while studying at West Baden College in West Baden Springs, Indiana. During these studies he produced his first published article in 1941 concerning the study of Latin. Worrying that his love of theology might lead him to pursue it out of his own willfulness at the cost of obedience he \"determined not to request further theological study; he would leave the determination of his future completely in the hands of the Holy Spirit.\" Hardon continued to study and obtained a master's degree in philosophy at Loyola University Chicago in 1941.\n\nOn June 18, 1947 (his 33rd birthday) he was ordained to the priesthood with his mother in attendance. The two Lutheran boarders of Hardon's childhood had remained close to the family and attended his ordination and first Mass. Within a year of seeing her son enter the priesthood Hardon's mother died.\n\nHardon took it as a sign of divine favor when his superiors, with no prompting from him, ordered him to attend the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome to continue his study of theology (from 1949 to 1951).\n\nWhile studying at Rome, he was appointed director of the graduate library. At one point his superior ordered him to retrieve all of the volumes held on loan by other graduate students that were declared heretical by the Catholic Church. Hardon later recalled:\n\nHe received his Doctor of Sacred Theology degree from the Gregorian University after finishing his doctoral dissertation on St. Robert Bellarmine entitled \"A Comparative Study of Bellarmine's Doctrine on the Relation of Sincere Non-Catholics to the Catholic Church\". Later in his life, he stated, “I could not have chosen a better subject in preparation for a lifetime of teaching Catholic doctrine.” That same year, 1951, he received the Papal Medal.\n\nDue to lifelong health problems, including asthma, Hardon was forced to return to America in 1951, where he joined the faculty of West Baden College teaching theology to Jesuit students. Hardon was denied his request to be a missionary to post-War Japan (at the newly opened Jesuit University in Tokyo) due to his health. Determined to be of some service for this endeavor, Hardon began to study comparative religion. During his studies of oriental religions he believed there were \"not only areas that were compatible with Christianity but also sections of thought that were clearly influenced in a direct manner by contact with the Christian message.\" Hardon began using his extensive knowledge of Asian customs and religions to train missionaries for that region.\n\nDuring this time Hardon pronounced his final vows on February 2, 1953 including the special Jesuit vow of unwavering fidelity to the pope.\n\nIn an effort to understand Protestantism he worked on a book released in 1956 entitled \"Protestant Churches in America\", which was met with critical acclaim even among Protestant circles. While still teaching full-time at West Baden, Hardon became a visiting professor invited to teach Catholic theology at several Protestant seminaries and colleges including Bethany School of Theology, Lutheran School of Theology, and Seabury-Western Divinity School. Janaro writes:\n\nThe novelty of the situation was not lost on his Protestant colleagues either, and upon his acceptance of a position at Seabury-Western Divinity school, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury sent a personal representative to mark the event - \"the first time in history an Anglican/Episcopalian seminary had appointed a teacher who was a member of the once hated and feared Society of Jesus.\" Hardon also served as an advisor to the Second Vatican Council on discussions about liturgy.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1967 Fr. Hardon taught Roman Catholicism and Comparative Religion at Western Michigan University. He released his book \"Religions of the World\" in 1963. By 1967 he returned to teaching Jesuit scholastics at two Jesuit theological schools in Illinois while working as a visiting professor at St. Paul University in Ottawa, where he taught furloughed missionaries classes in missiology. At this time he also began work for the Congregations for Religious and the Clergy in Rome to implement the renewal laid out in the documents of Vatican II.\n\nIn 1969 Hardon assisted in the founding of a union of religious called the Consortium Perfectae Caritatis. In 1971 he helped found the Institute on Religious Life. That same year Hardon and nine other notable American Catholics were summoned by Camaldolese abbot Ugo Modotti acting on behalf of Pope Paul VI. The group was tasked to create a Catholic media organization and met three times a year for periods of two to three days. Hardon told an interviewer this was because \"the Holy Father's mission was very clear: American Catholics must get some control of the media of social communication; otherwise, the pope feared for the survival of the Church in our country.\" A year later Modotti informed Hardon that the Pope had accepted his recommendation to replace him with Hardon should any thing befall the Abbot. Two weeks later Modotti was found dead in his bed and Hardon took over the mission.\n\nIn 1972, Hardon furthered his media apostolate by founding Mark Communications in Canada. Through his work with the papacy he was later asked by Paul VI to start Pontifical Catechetical Institutes in the United States to ensure the correct catechetical formation of religious educators. Hardon assisted and supported those establishing these organizations, especially Msgr. Eugene Kevane.\n\nIn 1974 Hardon became a professor at St. John's University in New York City at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Catholic Doctrine. At this time he worked with the Sisters of Notre Dame of Chardon, Ohio to make \"Christ Our Life\", a series of religious textbooks for elementary students.\n\nHardon continued to have health problems throughout his life. In 1981 he had a quadruple bypass at a hospital in Chicago, which would be his seventeenth hospitalization since joining the Jesuits.\n\nWhile teaching at St. John's, Hardon reacted to a woman's question about his thoughts on the Enneagram of Personality. He responded with an article listing his objections to the concept, viewing it as a New Age process dangerous to the Catholic faith. Soon after he was summoned to appear before his Jesuit superior to speak on the matter, at the conclusion of the meeting he was informed he would be forbidden to teach at any Jesuit institution. At the time of his death Hardon had not been allowed to teach at a Jesuit school for sixteen years. He viewed this as persecution for teaching the faith and saw it as \"white martyrdom\" and when recalling it would advise his listeners that they should be willing to suffer for the true doctrines of Catholicism. Hardon was also rebuffed by the chancery of the Archdiocese of Detroit who refused to use any of his books in their catechetical materials and he was never invited to their conferences and seminars - though he was in high demand across the rest of the nation. The conservative Catholic newspaper \"The Wanderer\" reported that Fr. Patrick Halfpenny, vice-rector of Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, had a standing order at \"The Michigan Catholic\" (the diocesan newspaper of the Archdiocese of Detroit) that Hardon's picture was not to be printed and also that if his name was to be mentioned at all it would be in the smallest font possible, due to Halfpenny's belief that \"He's divisive.\" \"The Wanderer\" also pointed out that at the Mass celebrating the 50th anniversary of his ordination at Assumption Grotto in Detroit, though attended by many friends, not a single Jesuit other than Hardon was there.\n\nFather Hardon was a very prominent member of the Jesuit community, which is known for its academic rigor, and wrote over forty books on religion and theology, including \"Catholic Catechism: A Contemporary Catechism of the Catholic Church\" (1975), a defining volume of Catholic orthodoxy; and the \"Modern Catholic Dictionary\" (1980), a major Catholic reference dictionary published after the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). In addition to his own works Hardon contributed to six encyclopedias.\n\nHardon had a close working relationship with Pope Paul VI, engaging in several initiatives at the Pope's request, including his authoring of \"The Catholic Catechism\". Paul VI apparently displeased with the controversial Dutch Catechism and in line with his letter \"Solemni Hac Liturgia\" (Credo of the people of God) requested that Hardon produce a volume to synthesize what Catholics must believe and present it in the English language.\n\nFather Hardon's work \"The Catholic Catechism\" was a significant post–Vatican II work in the sense that it essentially brought modern Catholic teaching and faith into one book, unlike any other before. At the time of his death it had sold over 150,000 in hardback, and as a 623-page paperback had reached its 26th printing selling over one million copies. It served as the normative standard until the publishing of 1992's \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\", which is the official codified teaching of the Catholic Church, promulgated by Pope John Paul II. Hardon served as a consultant for the drafting of that document.\n\nHardon kept to a demanding work schedule, especially during the creation of the 1992 \"Catechism\". At that time, once daily demands for his advice as a local spiritual director lessened (around five or six pm), he would write and organize material and continue to work into the night (where upon it would be morning in Rome). He often received phone calls at this time from Cardinal Ratzinger who sought his advice and input to fine tune the \"Catechism\". Ratzinger had a good relationship with Hardon which included sending him notes of thanks for his assistance in the faith.\n\nHardon had sympathy for those attracted to Catholic groups (such as the Society of St. Pius X) that strenuously objected to portions of Vatican II documents, \"but he never for a moment accepted the premise that a schismatic act was ever justified.\"\n\nHardon was also a major contributor to Catholic newspapers and magazines and was executive editor of \"The Catholic Faith\" magazine.\n\nHardon founded several Catholic organizations, which include \"Inter Mirifica\" (a name taken from Vatican II's decree on social communication), the Marian Catechists (a catechist formation program following the teachings of St. Ignatius), and Holy Trinity Apostolate. He also served as an adviser to many Catholic organizations, including Catholics United for Faith.\n\nFather Hardon participated in various apostolates to religious communities. In the early 1980s, Pope John Paul II instructed Mother Teresa of Calcutta to have her order evangelize the poor in addition to looking after their material needs. When she stated she didn't know where to begin such an endeavor, the Pope referred her to Cardinal Ratzinger, who called upon Hardon to instruct her Missionaries of Charity. To fill this need Hardon wrote a catechetical course for Mother Teresa's order. The course later was adapted and used to create two catechetical home study courses for lay Catholics. In 1985 Hardon founded the Marian Catechist Apostolate, an organization that uses these home study courses to provide catechetical formation to lay people in order to prepare them for catechetical ministry.\n\nHardon also assisted Catholic home schoolers, and worked with Eternal Life of Bardstown, Kentucky, where he recorded several audio lectures on Catholic topics beginning in 1988. His first series for Eternal Life was against contraception which he viewed, in line with other conservative Catholics, as what \"greased the skids for the culture of death\" - seeing it as the source for acceptance of abortion and assisted suicide, all of which are condemned by Catholicism. After that series he recorded lectures on the Ignatian Exercises, followed by other programs \"including The Apostles' Creed, The Eucharist, Catholic Sexual Morality, and Angels and Devils.\" Due to problems with his voice, including long pauses, the recordings were digitally remastered to make him more audible by Ed Wolfrum who previously worked as a Motown music engineer.\n\nHe was known to be devoted to the Catholic practice of Eucharistic adoration, spending at least three hours a day praying before the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nHardon was a major force in establishing the \"Call to Holiness\" conference, which was held annually in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. The initial conference was held in the late 1990s to counter a nearby conference held the same weekend by the liberal Catholic group Call to Action. Hardon also played a key role in the conversion of Dave Armstrong who went from being a Protestant to becoming a Catholic apologist.\n\nHardon spent his last years working from an office on the grounds of the Assumption Grotto in Detroit serving as a spiritual director.\n\nAfter suffering from several illnesses, Father Hardon died from bone cancer at the Jesuits' Colombiere Center in Clarkston, Michigan on December 30, 2000. William J. Smith, who worked with Hardon at Eternal Life, reported that in the priest's final weeks, Hardon \"suffered tremendous physical pain, but he made himself 'a true victim soul.'\" He willed that at his death his extensive library and correspondence would go to Archbishop Raymond L. Burke. Each year Catholics in the Detroit area have a memorial Mass said for Hardon on December 30.\n\nThere is interest among some Catholics for his canonization, and a Church-sanctioned prayer for that cause has been written. Cardinal Raymond Burke, when he was serving as the Archbishop of St. Louis and was the national director of the Marian Catechist Apostolate (began by Hardon), initiated Father Hardon's cause for canonization in 2005. Father Robert McDermott, a former student of Hardon's, was the postulator for the cause until moving to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he serves as associate pastor at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church. An effort is underway to establish a Father Hardon library and study center at the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\n\nA concern for Hardon's cause for canonization arose in early 2012 when documents concerning fellow Jesuit Donald McGuire surfaced and were featured in a story by Peter Jamison in the San Francisco Weekly. McGuire was arrested on charges of sex-abuse in 2005 and found guilty of sexually molesting boys in federal and state courts. An article in SF Weekly reported that during a visit to Saint John Vianney, Hardon had a frank conversation with McGuire in which the latter admitted to taking showers with his alleged victim, asking the boy to massage his body, and allowing him to possess pornography in the room they shared while traveling. McGuire denied additional allegations that he had touched the boy's genitals and watched him masturbate. Hardon was apparently satisfied with what he heard. As he wrote to Schaeffer, \"Regarding showering, Fr. Don said that it was true, but the picture is not one of a lingering sensual experience. It was rather the picture of two firemen, responding to an emergency, one of whom was seriously handicapped and in need of support and care from the other.\" On the body rubs: \"Regarding the massages, Fr. Don said they were done with attention to modesty and were necessary to relieve spasm at the 4th-5th lumbar disc and the right leg, involving the sciatic nerve.\" (The fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae are at the bottom of the spine, just above the buttocks.) And the dirty magazines: \"Regarding pornography Fr. Don said that there were Playboy and Penthouse magazines, which he neither got nor threw away.\" Hardon concluded in the letter, \"I do not believe there was any conscious and deliberate sexual perversity.\" He added, \"I do believe Fr. McGuire was acting on principles which, though objectively defensible, were highly imprudent.\" He told McGuire's bosses that he 'should be prudently allowed to engage in priestly ministry.'…The situation is aggravated since McGuire went on to abuse more children after suggestions to return him to ministry were heeded.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He is also known as Ri Migash (), the Hebrew acronym for \"Rabbi Joseph Migash\".\n<br><br>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nJoseph ibn Migash was probably born in Seville (though Steinschneider believes it was Granada). He moved to Lucena at the age of 12 to study under the renowned Talmudist Isaac Alfasi. He studied under Alfasi at Lucena for fourteen years. Shortly before his death (1103), Alfasi ordained Ibn Megas as a rabbi, and - passing over his own son - also appointed him, then 26, to be his successor as Rosh Yeshiva (seminary head). Joseph ibn Migash held this position for 38 years. \n\nRabbi Abraham ben David, in his \"Sefer ha-Kabbalah\" (Book of Tradition), mentions Joseph ibn Migash, a grandfather who had the same name, as being a contemporary of Samuel haNagid, and that during the dispute between the supporters of Bulukkin and the supporters of Badis, the Berber ruler of Granada, Joseph ibn Migash had sided with Bulukkin in this dispute and fled to Askilia, to avoid punishment. \n\nIt is clear that Migash was a great scholar: Maimonides in the introduction to his Mishnah commentary says \"the Talmudic learning of this man amazes every one who understands his words and the depth of his speculative spirit; so that it might almost be said of him that his equal has never existed.\" Judah ha-Levi eulogizes him in six poems which are full of his praise. Joseph ibn Migash's best known student is probably Maimon, the father and teacher of Maimonides. In Maimonides' Introduction to his Mishnah commentary, he heaps lavish praises upon Rabbi Joseph ibn Migash (Halevi), saying of him: \"“I have collected what I stumbled across from the glosses of my father, of blessed memory, as well as others under the name of our Rabbi Joseph Halevi, of blessed memory; and as the Lord lives, the understanding of that man in the Talmud is astounding, as anyone [can see] who observes his words and the depth of his comprehension, until I can say of him that 'there has never been any king like unto him before him\"' \"in his method [of elucidation]. I have also collected all of the legal matters (Heb. \"halachot\") that I found that belonged to him in his commentaries, themselves.”\"\n\nThere is a tradition that Maimonides himself was a pupil of Joseph ibn Migash. This probably arose from the frequent references in Maimonides' works to him as an authority. It is unlikely that he was literally taught by him, as Maimonides was 6 years old at the time of Joseph ibn Migash's death.\n\nHowever, Maimonides' grandson published a pamphlet with the approval of his grandfather, in which it is described that Maimonides ran away from home in his youth, met Joseph ibn Migash, and studied under him for several years.\n\nJoseph ibn Migash authored over 200 Responsa, \"\"She'elot u-Teshuvot Ri Migash\"\" - originally in Judeo-Arabic - many of which are quoted in Bezalel Ashkenazi's \"Shittah Mekubetzet\". Five of Ibn Migash's responsa survived in Yemen, and were published by Rabbi Yosef Qafih in 1973. He specified Chananel Ben Chushiel and Alfasi as his authorities, but disagreed with Alfasi in about thirty some odd places related to Halacha. \n\nHe also authored a Talmudic commentary - \"ḥiddushim\" (novellae) on tractates \"Baba Batra\" (link here) and \"Shevuot\" (included in Joseph Samuel Modiano's \"Uryan Telitai\", Salonica 1795) - which is quoted by various Rishonim. His other works have been lost.\n\n"}

The route connects the town of Laughlin to the rest of the state via U.S. Route 95 (US 95).\n\nSR 163 and Arizona State Route 95 provide the next closest public Colorado River crossing to Hoover Dam. Due to the restriction of commercial vehicles over the dam following the September 11 attacks, SR 163 comprised part of the required detour for truck traffic traveling between the Las Vegas and Phoenix metropolitan areas until October 2010, when the Mike O'Callaghan – Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge just downstream from the dam was opened to traffic.\n\nPrior to the renumbering of Nevada state routes in the late 1970s, SR 163 previously comprised the northern part of State Route 76 and all of State Route 77.\n\nState Route 163 begins as a four-lane divided highway at its junction with US 95 just north of the California state line. From there, the highway negotiates some fairly steep mountain grades as it loses elevation heading east toward Laughlin. Just outside Laughlin, the divided highway comes together and intersects Casino Drive before crossing the Colorado River and entering Bullhead City, Arizona on Arizona State Route 95.\n\nState Route 77 first appeared on Nevada state maps in 1942 as an unimproved road. At that time, SR 77 had an eastern terminus near the Bulls Head Dam (later Davis Dam) site and a western terminus at former State Route 76 (now an unnumbered road), which connected to US 95 north of the current US 95/SR 163 junction. By 1947, the west end of SR 76 was realigned and paved; along with a paved SR 77, this new pavement would eventually form the majority of SR 163. As of 1973, the southern part of SR 76 was removed from the state highway system and SR 77 was extended to US 95 along the paved alignment of the former SR 76.\n\nIn 1976, Nevada's highway department began a project to renumber the state highway system. SR 77 was reassigned to State Route 163 during this process; this change was reflected on official state maps in 1978.\n\n"}

It was the second general election in the Northwest Territories' history. The legislature gained three seats, and six new elected members. The three appointed \"at large\" legal advisors who sat in the assembly in the first legislature were no longer needed. Frederick W. A. G. Haultain was the government leader.\n\nThe key issue in this election was the French language question. Politicians had spent the previous three years divided on the issues of eliminating the status of the French language as an official language of the territory, and of assimilation of the French-speaking population. The appointed government made French an official language in Section 11 of the \"Northwest Territories Act of 1877\" that gained Royal Assent 28 April 1877. Prior to that, French was an official language while the Northwest Territories was administered under the \"Manitoba Act\" from 1870 to 1875.\n\nThe issue was ignited by Lieutenant Governor Joseph Royal reading the Speech from the Throne in French on 31 October 1888. The outcry caused Royal to read his second throne speech in English only. On 28 October 1889, the issue was made dormant when a Record Division was taken on the \"Language Resolution\", a motion that stated the assembly did not need official recognition of languages. The vote was 17 for 2 against. But this did not last, because the federal government got involved, and warned the Lieutenant Governor Royal to start making speeches in French again, and tried to legislate official bilingualism back in the territory, through the House of Commons of Canada. The bill was defeated on second reading, however.\n\nThe interference by the Government of Canada resulted in members being elected to the assembly who favoured English as the only official language. On 19 January 1892 Haultain made a motion that only English would be used in the Assembly. The motion passed on division: 20 for, 4 against.\n\nThe turnout can not be established as no voters lists were in use. Candidates were elected as part of a consensus government, i.e., without political parties.\n\nNote: No vote returns, are currently available from the Batoche, St. Albert and Souris districts\n\nFor complete electoral history, see individual districts\n\nNote:\nin 1892 Charles Boucher was appointed by judicial order, and Charles Nolin was forced to step down.\n\n"}

In it, she defines the self-defense movement serves as a form of feminist empowerment and consciousness raising that can be used to make feminist theory accessible to women who would otherwise be unreceptive. She also proposes the idea that by participating in self-defense, women change the definition of femininity and alter the gender roles, both male and female, that support existing rape culture. Although McCaughey takes a generally positive stance regarding self-defense, and dedicates a chapter to countering various criticisms of women's self-defense from within feminist theory, she does acknowledge and examine several practical and legal concerns with self-defense. As part of that, she analyzes the legal repercussions of violent self-defense, including consideration of the way that racism, classism, sexism, and stereotypes concerning battered wife syndrome affect the legal system's judgement on whether or not a woman's self-defense is legitimate.\n\n\"Reel Knockouts\" (co-edited with Neal M.

He served as chancellor for his kinsman, Charles Martel. Chrodegang is claimed to be a progenitor of the Frankish dynasty of the Robertians.\n\nHe was born in the early eighth century at Hesbaye (Belgium, around the old Roman civitas of Tongeren) of a noble Frankish family, possibly the son of Sigramnus, Count of Hesbaye, and , daughter of Lambert II, Count of Hesbaye. Landrada was the sister of Rotrude of Hesbaye, Charles Martel's first wife. \n\nHe was educated first at the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Trond, one of the oldest and most powerful abbeys in the Low Countries, and then at the cathedral school of Metz. At the court of Charles Martel, became his referendary, then chancellor, and in 737 prime minister. Sometime after 742, he was appointed to succeed Sigibald as Bishop of Metz, while still retaining his civil office.\n\nIn 753 he met and escorted Pope Stephen II when the pontiff visited France to seek help against Lombard incursions. As apostolic delegate to the Frankish kingdom, he was directly involved in the coronation of Pepin in 754 and the subsequent defeat of the Longbard king Aistulf. He accompanied the pope to Ponthieu.\n\nAfter the death of Saint Boniface, Pope Stephen conferred the \"pallium\" on Saint Chrodegang (754–755), thus making him an archbishop, but not elevating the See of Metz. In 762, during a dangerous illness, he introduced among his priests a confraternity of prayer known as the League of Attigny. Saint Chrodegang was well versed in Latin and the native early Old High German. He died at Metz on 6 March 766 and was buried in Gorze Abbey, the site of his principal shrine.\n\nAccording to M.A. Claussen, \"Chrodegang's work lay at the foundation of the Carolingian spiritual revival of later eighth and ninth centuries.\"\nIn 748 he founded Gorze Abbey (near Metz). He also established St. Peter's Abbey on the Moselle, and did much for the abbeys of Gengenbach and Lorsch. For the latter he is said to have obtained the relics of Saint Nazarius, and for Gorze those of Saint Gorgonius. In his diocese he introduced the Roman Liturgy and musical chant, and also enriched community life for the canons of his cathedral.\n\nAround 755, he wrote a special rule for them, the Regula Canonicorum, later known as 'Rule of Chrodegang'. The rule, containing thirty-four chapters, which he gave his clergy was based on the Rule of St. Benedict. The purpose of the rule was principally pastoral; to encourage the mutual support of a community as found in a monastic setting, while recognizing the very different responsibilities of canons serving the spiritual needs of the laity. Chrodegang necessarily adapted the Benedictine rule, particularly in regards to the hospitality characteristic of monasteries, and the care of the sick as there were neither guest houses nor hospices at cathedrals. \n\nThe rule was widely circulated and gave an important impulse to the spread of community life among the secular clergy. In 816, it was incorporated in part into the Institutio canonicorum Aquisgranensis established by the Council of Aachen. By the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Rule of Chrodegang was gradually supplanted by more popular rules based on Augustine. \n\nIt seems probable that the Rule of Chrodegang was brought by Irish monks to their native land from the monasteries of north-eastern Gaul, and that Irish anchorites originally unfettered by the rules of the cloister bound themselves by it. The \"Rule of Céli Dé\", which is preserved in the Leabhar Breac, and has been attributed to Máel Ruain, was possibly written in the 9th century by one of his community. The Rule \"...is more a canonical than a monastic rule, and analogous to Chrodegang of Metz's \"Regula Canonicorum\".\"\n\nIn the course of the 9th century mention is made of nine places in Ireland (including Armagh, Clonmacnoise, Clones, Devenish and Sligo) where communities of these Culdees were established as a kind of annex to the regular monastic institutions. They seem especially to have had the care of the poor and the sick, and were interested in the musical part of worship.\n\n\n\n"}

The goal for players is to defeat every other team in the game. Gameplay could continue indefinitely until this occurred.\n\nThe game lacks a season mode. Instead, in the one-player mode the player's goal was to defeat every other team featured in the game in the order of their choosing in a round robin style. Wins and losses were not recorded, and the player could continue playing indefinitely until all other teams were defeated. While this meant that there was no set schedule of games, pitchers did have a stamina rating that once depleted would take several games' worth of rest to recover from. In this way, the game simulated the idea of a pitching rotation.\n\nOn the initial screen, players can choose to play 1 or 2 player games, as well as spectator mode (CPU vs. CPU), a 1 or 2 player All-Star game, or enter a password. Passwords are given out after every game and record what teams the player has beat, as well as the pitcher's stamina levels.\n\nFunctionally, the game plays similarly to \"R.B.I. Baseball\", but with a few notable fun exceptions. For example, the umpires are anthropomorphic rabbits, players become unconscious when they are forced out or knocked out by the ball, and there are different, more kid-friendly animations for events such as home runs and close plays at the plate. If neither team has won after the 12th inning, the game ends in a tie, similar to the Japanese League. Like in real baseball, typical gameplay includes pinch hitters and pinch runners, stolen bases, four types of pitches and players with different attributes. Neither the Ultra, nor the Super league use the DH rule. At the end of the game each team's game statistics are tracked.\n\n\"Bad News Baseball\" features 12 teams, each with imaginary rosters. Each player has different abilities based on their ratings which are related but not directly tied to their presented statistics. The teams themselves correspond loosely to actual Major League Baseball teams. For example, the Oakland team has green and yellow uniforms, much like the Oakland A's baseball team does. However, no actual team nicknames are used, and rosters have no resemblance to their MLB counterparts. The game also boasted all-star teams for each of the two leagues, which the player could modify.\n\nThe game also features the ability to play as girls. In girls mode, the teams remain the same, but the rosters are completely different, effectively creating 12 new teams. This feat is achieved by holding Down and Left on Controller 1 and holding Up on controller 2 (while still holding Down+Left) and hitting the RESET button on the NES.\n\nBad News Baseball generally received average reviews from critics. Japanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\" rated the game a 25/40.\n"}

It was established in 1947 and is affiliated with the evangelical Christian Missionary Church.\n\nBethel is a part of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities and the Council of Independent Colleges. It is regionally accredited by The Higher Learning Commission. The institution also has specialized accreditation by The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC), the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM), the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE).\n\nCurrently, Bethel is organized into three academic areas: Division of Arts & Sciences; Division of Humanities & Social Sciences; School of Nursing. Additionally, there are four graduate programs administered in conjunction with the schools through the Office of Adult and Graduate Studies.\n\nThere are approximately 2000 students distributed across these programs. About 1300 are traditional students pursuing bachelor's degrees right after high school. 650 are adult students who take classes on evenings and weekends which lead to bachelors or associate degrees. 250 are enrolled in graduate programs. The Bethel University faculty is composed of about 115 full-time members.\n\nBethel College changed its name to Bethel University upon the end of commencement exercises on May 5, 2019.\n\nBethel University offers undergraduate, graduate and adult degree programs across the spectrum of disciplines that characterizes American higher education at small colleges. The traditional academic majors include a substantial general education component which is typical of most liberal arts institutions. With some variation by major program, these students take courses in history, literature, philosophy, fine arts, communication (oral and written), psychology, sociology, science, mathematics, physical education, and foreign language. Furthermore, because of the university's identification with Christianity, all students take courses in Bible (Old and New Testament) and an introductory theology course. These general education courses provide a broad background across the disciplines upon which more depth is pursued in a major (or majors).\n\nBethel University teams are known as the Pilots. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) (NAIA Division II for basketball) and competes in the Crossroads League, (formerly known as the Mid-Central College Conference). The Pilots also compete as a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). Basketball, baseball, and softball games are broadcast by the Regional Radio Sports Network.\n\nThe Pilots offer eight men's sports, nine women's sports, and two coed sports:\n\nMen's sports:\n\nWomen's sports:\n\nCoed:\n\nThe most recent sports added were men's and women's bowling and swimming & diving.

{"id": "2217590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217590", "title": "Choristodera", "text": "Choristodera\n\nChoristodera is an extinct order of semiaquatic diapsid reptiles that ranged from the Middle Jurassic, or possibly Late Triassic, to at least the early Miocene. It was named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1884. Choristoderes have been found in North America, Asia, and Europe, and possibly also North Africa and East Timor. The most common fossils are typically found from the Late Cretaceous to the lower Eocene. Cladists have placed them between basal diapsids and basal archosauromorphs, but the phylogenetic position of Choristodera is still uncertain. It has also been proposed that they represent basal lepidosauromorphs. Most recently, workers have tentatively placed Choristodera within Archosauromorpha, with their ear bone anatomy more closely correlating to those of archosaurs and turtles than to those of lepidosaurs.\n\nChampsosauridae is the best-known family of the Choristodera and typifies the group. \"Champsosaurus\" was first described from Late Cretaceous strata of Montana by Cope in 1876. Champsosaurs resembled modern gharials (gavials) or false gharials. The skull of these animals have a long, thin snout filled with small, sharp conical teeth. This is due to champsosaurs and gharials occupying similar Ecological niches: Hunting small aquatic prey in rivers and swamps. This is a classic example of convergent evolution. More primitive choristoderes have shorter, broader snouts.\n\nThere are major differences seen between choristoderes and gharials and other crocodilians, however, particularly in the skull. The orbits are found well forward on the skull, and the rear of the skull is bulbous, hugely expanded and consists of complex bony arches surrounding empty space. These spaces probably contained massive jaw muscles. Other hypotheses for the spaces, such as an otic sensory organ housing, have been tossed around with little support. The external nares are found on the tip of the rostrum. This indicates that champsosaurs breathed while submerged by extending their rostrum through the water surface while their body rested on the bed of the lake or stream. Crocodylians and phytosaurs have their nares located dorsally on their rostrum or skull respectively. This position allows them to rest submerged just below the surface.\n\nChampsosaur skulls are actually very similar to lizard skulls, though heavily modified. This has led some researchers to consider champsosaurids as lepidosauromorphs. However, champsosaurs lack the complex quadrate of lepidosaurians. With features of both diapsid groups, the phylogenetic position of Choristodera is highly confused.\n\nOther features found in choristoderes include heavily ossified gastralia and modified distal limbs, not just the manus and pes, used as paddles. In addition, champsosaur ribs are short and massive, as in other aquatic reptiles. The thorax is dorso-ventrally flattened, and the tail is laterally compressed to aid in swimming. Skin impressions found with champsosaur fossils show non-overlapping scales of very small size and the skin containing no scutes like those found in crocodilians (see crocodile exoskeleton).\n\nMost choristoderes have rather simple teeth, but neochoristoderes have teeth completely enveloped in striated enamel with an enamel infolding at the base, labiolingually compressed and hooked, the exception being \"Ikechosaurus\" which has still rather simple teeth aside from the start of an enamel infolding. There is some tooth differentiation, with the anterior teeth being larger than the posterior ones. Choristoderes have retained palatal teeth, indicating food manipulation in the mouth.\n\nAs a whole, choristoderes were exceptionally well adapted to life in the water. In forms like \"Champsosaurus\", only adult females could crawl ashore to lay eggs on land, with males and juveniles appearing to be incapable of doing so, while \"Hyphalosaurus\" and \"Monjurosuchus\" are known to have been ovoviviparous.\n\nIt appears that, at least on \"Champsosaurus\", the ear bones were internal and located near the base of the skull. This study also finds nasal conchae in all neochoristoderes aside from \"Ikechosaurus\", suggesting this animals were capable of regulating their body temperature in their cold aquatic environments.\n\nChampsosaurid remains are known from as far as East Timor.\n\nStrict consensus of 10 most parsimonious trees from the analysis of Matsumoto \"et al\". (2019):\n\nLong considered to be a morphologically conservative group, recent phylogenetic analyses and descriptions of new taxa have revolutionized understanding of this taxon.\n\nThe order Choristodera comprises two monophyletic groups and three basal taxa. Primitive choristoderes are characterized by small body size, a large, dorsally directed orbit and closed lower temporal fenestrae.\n\n\"Cteniogenys\" is the most basal choristodere. Like \"Monjurosuchus\", it is a small-bodied, lizard-like animal. The webbed feet of \"Monjurosuchus\" reflect its aquatic lifestyle. \"Cteniogenys\" is known from North America and Europe, while \"Monjurosuchus\" is known from China.\n\n\"Lazarussuchus\" was considered the most basal choristoderan when first described, and hence a late-surviving basal choristodere. However, Matsumoto \"et al\". (2013) recovered \"Lazarussuchus\" in a clade along with hyphalosaurids and monjurosuchids, as did the cladistic analysis of \"Coeruleodraco\" by Matsumoto \"et al\". (2019). This taxon is known from Cenozoic deposits in France and the Czech Republic. One species, \"L. dvoraki\", persisted into the early Miocene in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe two small-bodied choristoderes, \"Shokawa\" and \"Hyphalosaurus\" form the clade Hyphalosauridae within Choristodera. Their elongate necks and tails represent a unique shared derived condition. They resemble small plesiosaurs or nothosaurs. \"Shokawa\" is known from Japan, and \"Hyphalosaurus\" is known from China.\n\nThe named clade Neochoristodera includes \"Champsosaurus\", \"Tchoiria\", \"Simoedosaurus\", and \"Ikechosaurus\". This group of large-bodied reptiles is characterized by elongate snouts and relatively small orbits. Although it reflects our early understanding of the Choristodera as a whole, it in fact represents a highly derived condition.\n\nThe neochoristoderan taxa Champsosauridae and Simoedosauridae are found from the Late Cretaceous to the middle Eocene, indicating that the group survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. \"Champsosaurus\" teeth, vertebrae, and other bones are common fossils in Cretaceous deposits such as the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta and the Lance Formation of Wyoming. The presence of champsosaurs as far north as the North Slope of Alaska implies warmer temperatures during the Cretaceous. The Paleocene species, \"Champsosaurus gigas\", is the largest known champsosaur. The most complete skeleton was found at the Wannagan Creek site in North Dakota, but is found throughout North American Paleocene strata in the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Montana. \"C. gigas\" is unusual among Paleocene reptiles in that it is far larger than known Mesozoic ancestors, at about 3 meters in length (10 ft) versus 1.5 meters (5 ft) for the largest Cretaceous champsosaurs.\n\n\"Simoedosaurus\" is known from Europe, western Asia and North America, \"Tchoria\" is known from Mongolia and \"Ikechosaurus\" is known from China. \"Champsosaurus\" is known from North America, where its distinctive, hourglass-shaped vertebral centra are important biostratigraphic indicators.\n\n\"Pachystropheus rhaeticus\" may or may not be a choristodere. If a member of Choristodera, it extends the fossil record of the choristoderes from the Middle Jurassic back 45 mya and implies a significant ghost lineage. However, \"Pachystropheus\" lacks any cranial material, and all of the postcranial adaptations that link it to choristoderes may merely reflect convergent adaptations to an aquatic lifestyle. All unambiguous choristoderes were freshwater animals, while \"Pachystropheus\" was recovered from European marine transgressive sequences. \"Pachystropheus\" may be a choristodere, or it may be a type of thalattosaur, a large bodied, long necked group of marine reptiles. More complete fossil material is needed in order to resolve the placement of \"Pachystropheus\".\n\nThe ultimate extinction of choristoderes may have been due to a number of possible causes, such as falling temperatures and habitat loss. Competition with crocodilians has occasionally been cited as a possible source of decline, but the co-existence of large choristoderes with aquatic crocodilians, as well as a fairly broad range of morphology in both clades, render this unresolved, if not unlikely.\n\nIn 2007, Buffetaut \"et al\". reported the discovery of a two-headed fossil of a juvenile \"Hyphalosaurus\", apparently the first known case of a two-headed fossil tetrapod.\n\n\n"}

Both repeat KDLO.\n\nKPLO also has a fill-in translator on channel 29 in Pierre.\n\nA third semi-satellite, KCLO-TV (channel 15) in Rapid City, clears all network programming as provided through its parent and simulcasts KELO's newscasts (with local weather inserts), but airs a separate offering of syndicated programming; there are also separate commercial inserts and legal station identifications. Although KCLO maintains a news bureau and advertising sales office on Canyon Lake Drive in Rapid City, master control and most internal operations are based at KELO's studios. As Rapid City is located in the Mountain Time Zone, KCLO's prime time schedule starts at 6 p.m. rather than the usual 7 p.m. start for the rest of Mountain Time, or in Central Time, where the KELOLand network's other stations are located.\n\nKELO signed on air on May 19, 1953 as South Dakota's first television station. It was owned by Midcontinent Media, a theater and broadcasting conglomerate, along with KELO radio (AM 1320 and 92.5 FM). It was a primary NBC affiliate, but it also carried programs from ABC, CBS and DuMont. After KSOO-TV (now KSFY-TV) signed on in 1960, KELO switched its primary affiliation to CBS and has remained with that network ever since. \n\nShortly after KELO signed on, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collapsed eastern South Dakota, southwestern Minnesota and northwest Iowa into one giant television market. Later in the 1950s, Midcontinent began signing on satellite stations of KELO to serve its vast coverage area. KDLO in Florence was the first of the satellite stations to go on the air on September 27, 1955; followed by KPLO, licensed to Reliance and serving South Dakota's state capitol of Pierre on July 15, 1957.\n\nKELO expanded to western South Dakota in 1981, when it signed on K15AC (channel 15), a translator of KPLO-TV, to serve Rapid City. On November 28, 1988, it was upgraded to a full-powered semi-satellite as KCLO. Rapid City had been one of the few areas of the country without full service from the three major networks.\n\nKELO was home to \"Captain 11\", a popular children's show in the area, from 1955 until 1996. Captain 11 was Dave Dedrick, the station's longtime weatherman. He had been a popular radio personality before KELO went on air.\n\nChannel 11 originally broadcast from a tower near Shindler, South Dakota. On September 20, 1955, it was destroyed in a severe windstorm—believed to be a tornado. Station engineers had the station back on the air in 48 hours—just in time for the World Series. In 1956, the station erected a tower on the same site, expanding its coverage area to most of eastern South Dakota. In 1967, KELO moved to a new tower near Rowena, shared with KSFY. The Shindler tower is still used as a backup.\n\nOn June 24, 1968; a North Central airliner clipped a guy wire on the year-old Rowena tower, bringing it down. Luckily, the plane landed safely with no injuries. KELO engineers had the station back on the air in three days from the old tower in Shindler. The Rowena tower was quickly rebuilt.\n\nOn January 11, 1975, the KELO tower was destroyed by a powerful winter storm. Within hours, the station was back on the air from Shindler. The tower was again rebuilt at Rowena and became operational on December 19, 1975. The Rowena site is sometimes called the \"Bermuda Triangle\" of tower sites due to the numerous collapses.\n\nIn the years that followed, KDLO's tower collapsed and KELO lost other microwave and translator sites to storms and other reasons. KPLO's tower collapsed on January 22, 2010 in a severe ice storm. It returned to the air on March 19, 2010. For a time, however, it operated at low power, leaving Pierre without an over-the-air signal. The FCC subsequently issued a construction permit for a low-powered fill-in translator on channel 29 in Pierre.\n\nOn November 25, 1986, KELO began broadcasting its programming in stereo. In 1995, Midcontinent Media sold KELO to Young Broadcasting; the sale was approved by the FCC on May 31, 1996. The station celebrated its 50th anniversary on May 19, 2003. \n\nA late-season ice storm on April 6, 1997 caused the KXJB-TV mast in Traill County, North Dakota to collapse. As a result, several cable systems in eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota were unable to receive CBS programming. Some cable systems temporarily or permanently replaced KXJB with KDLO. (CBS programming in Eastern North Dakota has since moved to KXJB-LD and KVLY-DT2.)\n\nOn June 6, 2013, Young Broadcasting announced that it would merge with Media General. The merger was approved on November 8, after Media General shareholders approved the merger a day earlier; it was completed on November 12. \n\nOn January 27, 2016, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Media General, including KELO, with the sale being completed on January 17, 2017, bringing KELO-TV under common ownership with ABC affiliate KCAU-TV in Sioux City, Iowa.\n\nThe stations' digital signals are multiplexed:\n\nKELO-TV began broadcasting its digital signal on March 6, 2003, becoming the first full-powered digital signal in South Dakota. The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 32 to VHF channel 11 for post-transition operations. KDLO was originally scheduled to shut down its analog signal and broadcast in digital only on February 17, 2009, while KELO, KPLO and KCLO's broadcasts would become digital-only effective June 12, 2009; however, the FCC rejected Young Broadcasting's petition for early termination of analog broadcasts on KDLO-TV.\n\nMyUTV is carried on the second digital subchannels of KELO, KDLO, and KPLO, airing in 1080i full high definition over KELO-DT2 and in 16:9 widescreen standard definition over KDLO-DT2 and KPLO-DT2. It is currently affiliated with the MyNetworkTV programming service, and also carries the regional weather channel \"KELO Weather Now\", primarily during the overnight hours; it is carried on cable channel 10 in most areas. It was formerly a UPN affiliate, branded simply as \"My UTV\", when it launched in 2004 until it affiliated with MyNetworkTV in September 2006.\n\nMyUTV is not seen in the Rapid City market on KCLO. The UPN affiliate there was KCPL-LP (channel 52), and the MyNetworkTV affiliate for Rapid City is KWBH-LP which is simulcast over KNBN-DT2 (channel 21.2; formerly KKRA-LP, channel 24); as a result, MyUTV still cannot be carried on KCLO by FCC market rules. The CW's programming is seen on KCLO-DT2 (channel 15.2) in Rapid City.\n\nEver since an upgrade to their multiplexer equipment sometime in December 2019, the KDLO-TV and KPLO simulcasts of MyUTV, along with the other two subchannels, have been broadcasting in a widescreen SD picture format; the subchannels were previously being offered in 480i over KDLO-TV and KPLO. Today, all subchannels are offered in the 16:9 aspect ratio on all three stations. By February 2020, the KELO-DT2 feed of MyUTV had been airing in 1080i full HD over the air, per additional distribution of digital bandwidth into channels 11.1 and 11.2 and further compression of the Ion Television and Court TV Mystery subchannels of KELO; however, the KDLO-DT2 and KPLO-DT2 feeds of MyUTV continue to be aired in the widescreen SD picture format.\n\nIn 2017, the station added Escape (now Court TV Mystery) to its 11.4 subchannel.\n\nCurrently, KELO-TV broadcasts a total of 26½ hours of local newscasts each week (with 4½ hours each weekday and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays), carrying the most hours of local news out of any station in South Dakota; the station is presently the only station in South Dakota carrying newscasts on weekend mornings. KELO's newscasts have used Gari Communications' \"The CBS Enforcer Music Collection\" as its news music package since 1997. Throughout its history, KELO-TV has won ten Regional Emmy Awards; along with a national Emmy win in 1999 for a public service announcement for the Tradition of Caring, and two 2008 wins for \"Best Mid-Size Market Newscast\" for the station's weekday morning newscast \"KELOLand This Morning\" and a feature story titled \"Dominic's Wish\".\n\nOn July 11, 1988, KELO began using a satellite uplink truck to allow live remotes of news stories. Four years later on January 21, 1991, KELO began closed captioning its local newscasts for the first time. On October 19, 2011, beginning with its 5:00 p.m. newscast, KELO-TV became the second television station in South Dakota to broadcast its local newscasts in high definition (ABC affiliate KSFY-TV began producing its newscasts in HD in August of that year), all in-studio and field segments are broadcast in the 1080i HD picture format; the station introduced a new set for its newscasts, updated its editing and control room equipment, and anchors began using iPads instead of paper scripts. Another new set debuted on February 2, 2020, on its 10:00 p.m. newscast.\n\nKELO currently features four on-camera meteorologists on its staff, of which two (including chief meteorologist Dr. Jay Trobec) have earned the Certified Broadcast Meteorologist designation from the American Meteorological Society. KELO operates a network of automatic observation sites operated with the WeatherBug software (and known as WeatherNet on air) which are updated every three seconds. On November 24, 1992, the station began using SkyCam systems primarily for use in weather situations.\n\nKELO operates a network of three doppler radars across South Dakota, and covering parts of North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa; KELO is the only station in each of the markets it served to operate such a large radar network. On September 8, 1997, KELO installed two live doppler weather radar units in Huron and Beresford, becoming the first station in the country to operate two doppler radars simultaneously; a third radar, located in Wall, was installed in 2001. In 2007, KELO upgraded the Huron radar to use dual polarization technology and quadrupled its power to 1 million watts, it also upgraded the computer systems at the Beresford and Wall radar systems. In addition, KELO rebranded its radar network as \"KELOLand Live Doppler HD\".\n\n\nCSI cable in Jamestown, North Dakota removed KELO effective December 31, 2009 due to duplication of Fargo, North Dakota station KXJB-TV, and stalled retransmission consent negotiations.\n\n"}

Originally over a series of five brochures from 1925 to 1927, the book—one of the early works on hypermodernism—introduced many new concepts to followers of the modern school of thought. It is generally considered to be one of the most important books in the history of chess.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts: \"The Elements\", \"Positional Play\", and \"Illustrative Games\".\n\nIn \"The Elements\" (), Nimzowitsch writes about the basics of his \"system\". He regards the following as the elements of chess strategy:\n\nThe next part, \"Positional Play\" (), is based largely on the elements taught in the first part. In it, Nimzowitsch tells how to play for a positional advantage. In particular, he argues that the center can be effectively controlled using pieces instead of pawns. This concept, now widely accepted, is one of the fundamental principles of hypermodernism.\n\n\"Illustrative Games\" contains annotated versions of fifty of Nimzowitsch's career games, which he refers to throughout the text.\n\n"}
{"id": "2217676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217676", "title": "Side-striped jackal", "text": "Side-striped jackal\n\nThe side-striped jackal (\"Canis adustus\" or \"Lupulella adusta\") is a canine native to Central and southern Africa. Unlike the smaller black-backed jackal which dwells in open plains, the side-striped jackal primarily dwells in woodland and scrub areas.\n\nFossil remains of \"C. adustus\" date back to the Pliocene era. A mitochondrial DNA sequence alignment for the wolf-like canids gave a phylogenetic tree with the side-striped jackal and the black-backed jackal being the most basal members of this clade, which means that this tree is indicating an African origin for the clade.\n\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group recommends that because DNA evidence shows the side-striped jackal (\"Canis adustus\") and black-backed jackal (\"Canis mesomelas\") to form a monophyletic lineage that sits outside of the Canis/Cuon/Lycaon clade, that they should be placed in a distinct genus, \"Lupulella\" Hilzheimer, 1906 with the names \"Lupulella adusta\" and \"Lupulella mesomelas\".\n\nThe side-striped jackal is a medium-sized canid, which tends to be slightly larger on average than the black-backed jackal. Body mass ranges from , head-and-body length from and tail length from . Shoulder height can range from . Its pelt is coloured buff-grey. The back is darker grey than the underside, and the tail is black with a white tip. Indistinct white stripes are present on the flanks, running from elbow to hip. The boldness of the markings varies between individuals, with those of adults being better defined than those of juveniles.\n\nThe side-striped jackal's skull is similar to that of the black-backed jackal's, but is flatter, with a longer and narrower rostrum. Its sagittal crest and zygomatic arches are also lighter in build. Due to its longer rostrum, its third upper premolar lies almost in line with the others, rather than at an angle. Its dentition is well suited to an omnivorous diet. The long, curved canines have a sharp ridge on the posterior surface, and the outer incisors are canine-like. Its carnassials are smaller than those of the more carnivorous black-backed jackal. Females have four inguinal teats.\n\nThe side-striped jackal tends to be less carnivorous than other jackal species, and is a highly adaptable omnivore whose dietary preferences change in accordance to seasonal and local variation. It tends to forage solitarily, though family groups of up to 12 jackals have been observed to feed together in western Zimbabwe. In the wild, it feeds largely on invertebrates during the wet season and small mammals, such as the springhare, in the dry months. It frequently scavenges from campsites and the kills of larger predators. In the wild, fruit is taken exclusively in season, while in ruralised areas, it can account for 30% of their dietary intake. The side-striped jackal tends to be comparatively less predatory when compared to other jackal species. It typically does not target prey exceeding the size of neonatal antelopes, and one specimen was recorded to have entered a duck's pen to eat their feed, whilst ignoring the birds.\n\nThe side-striped jackal lives both solitarily and in family groups of up to seven individuals. The family unit is dominated by a breeding pair, which remains monogamous for a number of years.\n\nThe breeding season for this species depends on where they live; in southern Africa, breeding starts in June and ends in November. The side-striped jackal has a gestation period of 57 to 70 days, with average litter of three to six young. The young reach sexual maturity at six to eight months of age, and typically begin to leave when 11 months old. The side-striped jackal is among the few mammal species that mate for life, forming monogamous pairs.\n\nThere are seven recognized subspecies of side-striped jackal:\n"}
{"id": "2217691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217691", "title": "Designated driver", "text": "Designated driver\n\nThe terms \"designated driver\" and \"designated driving\" (commonly known as DD), refer to the selection of a person who remains sober as the responsible driver of a vehicle whilst others have been allowed to drink alcoholic beverages.\n\nThus as a practical and ethical matter a \"designated driver\" is a person who abstains from alcohol on a social occasion in order to drive his or her companions home safely as an alternative to driving under the influence. In order to encourage these arrangements, some bar, restaurant and nightclub proprietors will offer free or reduced-price soft drinks to designated drivers.\n\nThe designated driver concept was developed in Scandinavia over several decades beginning in the 1920s, leading to a formalized designated driver program in the 1980s. \nThe program was introduced in Canada in 1986 by Hiram Walker and Sons as \"The Canadian Club Designated Driver Program\". The program was accepted readily and supported by the police, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the hospitality industry and the public. There were few if any detractors. The program was heavily promoted by Hiram Walker's President Doug Young and the company's PR agency Marshall Fenn Limited led by David Butler. The concept swept Canada, the United States and many other countries during 1986.\n\nThe concept was imported to the United States on a large scale in 1988 through the Harvard Alcohol Project, an initiative by the Harvard School of Public Health's Center for Health Communication, led by Jay Winsten. With heavy involvement by television networks and Hollywood studios, the campaign popularized the concept through public service announcements, as well as the encouragement of drunk driving prevention messages and designated driver references in popular television programs, such as \"Cheers\", \"L.A. Law\", and \"The Cosby Show\". The U.S. Department of Transportation used public affairs commercials with the phrase \"friends don't let friends drive drunk\".\n\nPresident Bill Clinton participated in the designated driver campaign throughout his presidency, taping public service announcements each year at the request of the Harvard Alcohol Project. With the endorsement of a broad range of individuals and organizations, designated driving became a national movement, with \"designated driver\" becoming a common phrase. Based on several polls indicating an increase in designated driving practices since the start of the initiative, the campaign is credited as a contributing factor to the decline in alcohol-related traffic fatalities between 1988 and 1994.\n\nSince 2005, the spirits company Diageo has used a similar concept in Brazil to discourage drunk driving. Called Piloto da Vez, the campaign was born with the sponsorship of McLaren. Juan Pablo Montoya, Mika Häkkinen and Lewis Hamilton have participated in the campaign.\n\nThough designated drivers are popular, groups often fail to use them properly. Often, there is a failure of those groups to designate the driver prior to making travel arrangements and arrive in separate vehicles. Even when a group does share a vehicle, it is not always the case that the designated driver remains sober. Failures to require driver abstinence or limitation of consumption is another problem. One study conducted at the Tijuana/San Diego border found that by asking groups intent on drinking to identify the designated driver prior to entering the bar district, the driver later returned with substantially lower BACs compared with the control groups.\n\nVarious college and high school organizations, such as RamRide at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado, CARPOOL at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, or Drive Safe Kalamazoo, at Western Michigan University and BUSY at Gulfport High School in Gulfport, Mississippi offer to give free rides home on weekend nights to fellow students.\n\nNumerous businesses have sprouted up across the United States to help address the problem of drinking and driving. Some transport their drivers home, as passengers, using one of three methods: car, collapsible scooter, or foldable bike. These are not necessarily true \"designated driver\" programs, but instead Safe Ride programs, as the sober driver is not designated from within the natural drinking group. Designated Drivers, Inc, was founded in 1998 and later based out of Las Vegas, NV. This company has used two person teams: one person to drive the impaired individual in their own vehicle, and the other person as the follow driver. Pittsburgh's Pear Transportation Company, aka The Pear Cares, has also become well known for using the two-person team approach. Dryver, formerly known as BeMyDD, established itself by offering designated driver services for events, car pickups for drivers who are too impaired to make it home, and personal drivers for evenings out. NightRiders, Incorporated was the first company to use collapsible, motorized scooters in the US. The drivers drove customers home using their own vehicles, stowing a scooter in the customer's trunk (or truck). Upon arrival to the customer's destination, the driver parked the vehicle, collected the fare, assembled the scooter from the vehicle, and rode off to the next customer. This company is now out of business, according to their website. Zingo Transportation has operated this kind of service in southern US cities since 2005.\n\nDesignated driver services in South Korea are widely prevalent and in high demand, especially in major cities such as Seoul and Busan. Designated driver call centers operate as a central dispatch with some vendors providing mobile apps to request a driver. The driver arrives at the location of the customer's vehicle and will drive it to the requested location for a fee. The Korean language word for these designated drivers for hire is 'dae-ri un-jeon' (대리운전) meaning replacement driver. According to the Korea Service Driver Society, an estimated 100,000 replacement drivers handle 700,000 customers a day across the country (2007) \n\nDesignated driver services in Australia exist in many capital cities and regional towns. The service is in high demand due to highly regulated, unreliable taxi services.\n\nIn 2017, Coca-Cola announced a promotion to encourage people to have sober drivers by offering free Coca-Cola.\n\nCanada has a long history with designated driver services provided by private enterprise going back to 1996 in Ontario. One of central Ontario's largest designated driver services CABn aHALF has transported thousands of clients home over the years. In the last 5 to 6 years, a number of designated driving services have cropped up all over the province with companies such as The DD Service bringing technology and professionalism to industry.\n\nB.C. has a huge market of designated driver services and new ones are created monthly. Companies throughout the province work 7 days a week to drive intoxicated individuals home in their own vehicles for a fee. If you expect customer service it is not the goal. The DD industry is not regular means for travel but a lifeline service \n\nThe designated driver service in China still under the initial stage. Some company conduct the profession service for public such as Hong Kong Designated Driver Limited (HKDD) and easydrive in Hong Kong work whole week to help individuals safely go home in their own cars. The HKDD also provide Android and iOS mobile APP for their users.\n\nBritish Columbia, Canada \n\nSome designated driver services have formed a special bond between breathalyzer manufacturers/distributors. They operate by combining their services at the point of sale during a special licensed event. Such events have been the Rockin' River Music Festival (2013), and Gone Country: Here for the Cure (2013). By allowing guests to know whether they are legal to drive and educate them on the current local laws concerning DUI, this method has been shown to reduce the potential for incidence related to drinking and driving. All intoxicated persons can be referred to waiting drivers on standby to take them home in their own vehicle safely. Currently only one company in Canada, Canadian Breath Analyzer or CBAC\" conducts operations with local licensed designated driver services.\n"}

{"id": "2217702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217702", "title": "Consecrated virgin", "text": "Consecrated virgin\n\nIn the Catholic Church, a consecrated virgin is a woman which has been consecrated by the church to a life of perpetual virginity as a spouse of Christ. Consecrated virgins are consecrated by the diocesan bishop according to the approved liturgical rite. \nThe consecrated virgins are to spend their time in works of penance and mercy, in apostolic activity and in prayer, according to their state of life and spiritual gifts. \n\nThe rite of consecration of virgins living in the world was reintroduced in 1970, under Pope Paul VI, in the wake of the Second Vatican Council. It is based on the template of the practice of the \"velatio virginum\" going back to the Apostolic era, especially the early virgin martyrs. The rite of consecration of virgins for nuns who made their final profession of vows has always existed in various forms from the time of St. Scholastica. \n\nThe 1983 Code of Canon Law and the 1996 Apostolic Exhortation \"Vita Consecrata\" by John Paul II speak of the reflourishing Order of Virgins \"(Ordo Virginum)\", the members of which represent an image of the church as heavenly Bride.\n\nThe number of consecrated virgins ranges in the thousands. While the Holy See does not keep official statistics, estimates derived from diocesan records range at around 5,000 consecrated virgins living in the world as of 2018.\nIn view of growing interest in the vocation, and of the upcoming 50th anniversary of its formal institution, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life issued the instruction \" Ecclesia Sponsae imago\" in July 2018.. \n\nWhile consecrated virginity resembles married life, a consecrated virgin may be part of a monastic community or continue to live “in the world” under the authority of her bishop, in service to the people of God in her diocese and globally.\n\nConsecrated virgins should not be confused with consecrated anchorites or hermits, who have a different vocation.\n\nThe Christian concept has a precedent in the Vestal Virgins of ancient Roman religion. \nChastity is one of the Seven Virtues in Christian tradition, listed by Gregory the Great at the end of the 6th century. Praise of chastity or celibacy as a religious virtue is already present in the New Testament, especially in 1 Corinthians, where Paul the Apostle suggests a special role for virgins or unmarried women () as more suitable for \"the things of the Lord\" ().\nIn 2 Corinthians 11:2, Paul alludes to the metaphor of the Church as Bride of Christ by addressing the congregation \n\"I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ\".\nIn Christian hagiography, there are numerous accounts of pre-Nicaean virgin martyrs, such as\nMargaret of Antioch, Agnes of Rome, Euphemia of Chalcedon and Lucia of Syracuse.\n\nIn the theology of the Church Fathers, the prototype of the sacred virgin is Mary, the mother of Jesus, consecrated by the Holy Spirit at Annunciation. \nAlthough not stated in the gospels, the perpetual virginity of Mary was widely upheld as a dogma by the Church Fathers from the 4th century. The tradition of a ritual form of the consecration also dates to the 4th century, but it is widely held that a more informal consecration was imparted to virgin women by their bishops dating from the time of the Apostles.\nThe first known formal rite of consecration is that of Saint Marcellina, dated AD 353, mentioned in \"De Virginibus\" by her brother, Saint Ambrose. Another early consecrated virgin is Saint Genevieve (c. 422 – c. 512).\n\nDuring the medieval period, the rite of consecration was maintained by nuns in monastic orders, such as the Benedictines and Carthusians. This consecration could be done either concurrently with or some time after the profession of solemn vows. \nAmong Carthusian nuns, there is the unique practice of these virgins being entitled to wear a stole, and a maniple, vestments otherwise reserved to clergy.\n\nTypically, mendicant nuns did not have the tradition of receiving the consecration of virgins but were content to have perpetual vows. Saint Margaret of Hungary (1242–1270), a Dominican nun, is a special case insofar as she received the consecration of virgins despite the Dominican tradition of not receiving it; this was done because her father, king Béla IV of Hungary, had her solemn vows dispensed by the pope for the purposes of a political marriage. The consecration of virgins put a stop to this as it could not be dispensed.\n\nThe modern revival of the rite of the consecration of virgins in the Catholic Church for women living outside of religious communities is associated with Anne Leflaive (1899–1987). The consecration of virgins after the fashion of the ancient Church was supported by certain French bishops in the early 20th century. Leflaive was directed towards this vocation by François de Rovérié de Cabrières, the bishop of Montpellier. She received the consecration in the chapel of Carmel at Paray-le-Monial on 6 January 1924, on her 25th birthday, by the bishop of Autun, Hyacinthe-Jean Chassagnon.\n\nThere was an increasing demand for such consecrations in the 1920s, and bishops requested clarification from the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life. The reply given on 25 March 1927 was in the negative. The Congregation forbade the revival of this type of consecration. The 1927 decree argued that the consecration of virgins living in the world \"(in saeculo viventes)\" had long fallen out of use, and was in contradiction to the then current Canon Law of 1917. It was also argued that the official sanction of a vow of virginity in a \"very imposing ceremony\" might risk to lead the women so consecrated to judge their status as superior to those of nuns, whose solemn vows are not accompanied by similar ceremonies, and even to divert some women who would otherwise have chosen a monastic vocation.\nIt was significantly due to Anne Leflaive's efforts over the following decades this ban was eventually rescinded in 1970. In 1939, Leflaive founded the secular Missionaries of Catholic Action, an institute of celibate women or widows living in the world, which was, however, suppressed in 1946. Beginning in the 1940s, Leflaive was in contact with Angelo Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII and with Giovanni Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, who were receptive to her ideas. During the 1950s, Leflaive visited Rome once a year in order to lobby at the Vatican for the re-instatement of the rite of consecration of virgins. Leflaive published \"Study of the Consecrations of Virgins in the Roman Pontifical\" in 1934, re-edited as \"Espouse du Christ\" in 1956, and as \"La Femme et l'Eglise\" in 1968.\nAt a time where the Reformed confessions began to introduce the ordination of women, Leflaive strictly rejected such a possibility, arguing that \"Christ and His Church offer to the woman a gift of great plentitude [sic]\" in the form of the Consecration of Virgins, already inscribed in the Roman Pontifical.\n\nIn 1950, Pius XII issued \"Sponsa Christi\", an apostolic constitution addressing the vocation of consecrated women and their mystical engagement with Christ.\nPius XII in 1950 decreed that only nuns living in reclusion were permitted to receive the formal consecration of virgins. In 1954, Pius cited \"Sponsa Christi\" his encyclical \"Sacra Virginitas\" as showing the importance of the office consecrated men and women fulfill in the Church.\n\nIn 1963, the Second Vatican Council requested a revision of the rite of the consecration of virgins that was found in the Roman Pontifical. The revised Rite was approved by Pope Paul VI and published in 1970. This consecration could be bestowed either on women in monastic orders or on women living in the world, which revived the form of life that had been found in the early Church.\n\nThe 1970 rite of \"Ordo Consecrationis Virginum\" states the following requirements for women living in the world to receive the consecration: \"that they have never married or lived in open violation of chastity; that, by their prudence and universally approved character, they give assurance of perseverance in a life of chastity dedicated to the service of the church and of their neighbor; that they be admitted to this Consecration by the Bishop who is the local Ordinary.\"\n\nConsecrated virgins living in the world belong to the consecrated life. They are not supported financially by their bishop, but must provide for their own upkeep. These women work in professions ranging from teachers and attorneys to that of firefighter. \n\nIn 1972, Elizabeth Bailey became the first virgin to be consecrated under the new rite in England,\nand the first known consecrated virgin in Britain since the 3rd century. \n\nThe number of consecrated virgins under the 1970 rite of consecration has grown into the thousands over the course of four decades. As of 2008, the United States Association of Consecrated Virgins (USACV) gave an \"educated guess\" of a total number of 3,000 consecrated virgins in 42 countries. In a 2015 survey, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (CICLSAL) established an estimated number of 4,000 consecrated virgins in 78 countries, with a growing tendency, with a projected increase to about 5,000 by 2020.\n\nThe 1970 decree states as a requirement that candidates \"have never married or lived in open violation of chastity\"). While the lack of a strict requirement of virginity was only implied by omission in the 1970 document, the Vatican on 4 July 2018 released a clarifying statement, explicitly conceding that: \"to have kept her body in perfect continence or to have practised the virtue of chastity in an exemplary way, while of great importance with regard to the discernment, are not essential prerequisites in the absence of which admittance to consecration is not possible.\" The statement was published in reaction to bishops requesting clarification due to the growing number of women showing interest in the vocation. The new clause leaves it to the \"good judgement and insight\" of the bishop to discern the suitability of a candidate to her vocation.\n\nThe US Association of Consecrated Virgins released a statement calling the new guidance \"shocking\" and \"deeply disappointing\" as well as \"intentionally convoluted and confusing\", \n\nBy the rite of consecration the diocesan bishop sets the virgin apart as a sacred person. The virgin who receives the consecration is elevated to the consecrated state, which she shares with religious and diocesan hermits. She becomes a member of the Order of Virgins, just as deacons belong to the Order of Deacons. \nThe consecration of virgins living in the world is reserved to bishops alone because bishops represent Christ the bridegroom and it is to their care virgins are entrusted, who are the images of the church. \n\nThe approved liturgical rite whereby the bishop consecrates the candidate is by the solemn rite of \"Consecratio Virginum (Consecration of Virgins)\". The usual minister of the rite of consecration is the bishop who is the local ordinary. The consecrated virgin is committed to perpetual virginity and to leading a life of prayer and service, and is \"strongly advised\" to observe the Liturgy of the Hours. \nThe legislation outlining this, as it appears in the 1983 Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church, says:\n\n\n"}

Occupying an entire city block bounded by Stamford Road, Beach Road, Bras Basah Road and North Bridge Road, it houses two hotels and an office tower over a podium which contains a shopping complex and a convention centre. The mall is managed by CapitaCommercial Trust and CapitaMall Trust. It was completed in 1986.\n\nBuilt on the former site of Raffles Institution, the first school in Singapore, and located beside the historic Raffles Hotel, its aluminium-finish and simple geometric designs gave a stark, modernist contrast to Victorian architecture and classical architecture which used to characterise architecture in that district.\n\nThe embassy of Hungary is located on the 29th floor of the Raffles City Tower, which also houses the delegation office of the European Union. \n\nThe development, initially called the Raffles International Centre, was first announced in 1969, planned to cover an area stretching from the then-site of Raffles Institution up to the Cathay Building. However, due to soaring costs and a shortage of skilled workers, the plans were put on hold from 1973 to 1975. However, due to cost issues, approval for construction was not given until 1979. That same year, the development was renamed Raffles City, and the development was shrunken to only the old Raffles Institution site.\n\nGroundbreaking on the site took place on 14 August 1980 and officially opened to the public on 3 October 1986. The complex was designed by I. M. Pei in one of his earliest works in the city state.\n\nIn the 1990s the shopping complex went under a major renovation, with a different look. In June 2005, the management announced that the basement section of the complex will be expanded, with 30 to 50 more shops and was completed in July 2006 with MPH Bookstores, food and beverage outlets and fashion shops occupying the extension. Gloria Jean's Coffees has also made a return to the country after exiting the country a few years ago. The complex is directly connected to City Hall MRT (Exit 'A\") station by escalators from the building entrance and to Esplanade MRT station (Exit 'G') from Basement 2, which leads to the Esplanade Xchange and then to Marina Square. \n\nOn 1 January 2002, the two hotels were rebranded as the Swissôtel The Stamford and Raffles The Plaza (now Fairmont Singapore]) when FRHI Hotels & Resorts took over the hotels' management.\n\nOn 19 March 2006, CapitaLand's real estate investment trust (REIT), CapitaCommercial Trust and CapitaMall Trust jointly acquired the development from Raffles Holdings for S$2.09 billion. The former will take up a 60 percent stake in the complex and the latter taking the remainder 40 percent. The trusts' shareholders approved of the purchase of the complex in July 2006. The deal has been completed in August 2006 and the complex is owned by the two trusts.\n\nOn 20 August 2006, the new owners announced their plans to expand the retail space between 150,000 and from its current , by using the space on the carpark floors on basements two and three. The two CapitaLand property trusts will spend S$86 million on the expansion. An underground link linking Esplanade and City Hall MRT stations opened on 15 July 2010.\n\nThe complex consists of the one-time world's tallest hotel and currently the world's fourteenth tallest hotel, the 73-storey Swissôtel The Stamford, a 28-storey high-end twin-tower hotel, the Fairmont Singapore and the rectangular 42-storey Raffles City Tower, an office block.\n\nRaffles City has several anchor tenants, such as supermarket Jason's Market Place, as well as department stores Robinsons and Marks & Spencer. M&S has opened since 2001, when Japanese departmental store Sogo vacated the space and the basement supermarket (now occupied by Jason's) in 2000 after the company ran into financial problems.\n\nThe 117th IOC Session in Singapore, was held from 2 to 9 July 2005 at the Raffles City Convention Centre on the fourth floor. Security at the complex was extremely tight during the event. At the IOC Session, London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\n"}

The academy building is located in Osprey Quay on the northern tip of the island, and the waters of Portland Harbour and Weymouth Bay, adjacent to the site, are the main areas used for sailing. Local, national and international sailing events have been held at the site since it was opened in 2000, and in 2005 WPNSA was selected to host the sailing events at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nThe academy was formed as a not-for-profit company in 1999 and officially opened on 1 April 2000. It occupied converted naval premises until a clubhouse was built, which was opened in June 2005 by the Princess Royal. £7.85 million of funding for the project was donated by charities, individuals and local councils; the National Lottery donated £3 million in 2003, and the South West Regional Development Agency added £3.34 million. The academy's aims are to promote the sport of sailing at all levels of competence and ability, through courses, training and events, and to contribute to the economic regeneration of the area. Since opening it has created a demand in service and marine industries worth around £10 million. WPNSA continues to promote sailing to local schools, offering benefits such as free boat hoist and storage. Use of the facilities and access to training is open to anyone in return for an annual membership fee. On 6 July 2005, London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the WPNSA was chosen to host the sailing events.\n\nPortland Harbour and Weymouth Bay are the main areas used for sailing. The harbour covers an area of , and is ideal for sailing as it is exposed to reliable winds from most directions, but is sheltered from large waves and currents by Chesil Beach and the breakwaters. The clubhouse houses facilities on two floors, including a gymnasium, seven lecture and meeting rooms for 260 people, an event hall with kitchens and a bar, VIP meeting rooms and offices, a lounge bar and cafeteria seating 350 people, and two balconies. The outside of the academy complex has a slipway and two deep water slipways, 30 pontoons with disabled access, cranage and boat hoists, boat storage and parking areas. WPNSA also operates Boscawen House, formerly an admiral's residence, which offers accommodation for a maximum of 47 people. The clubhouse generates 15–20% of its electricity from solar cells, and rainwater is collected from the roof to wash boats.\n\nIn November 2007, the South West Regional Development Agency signed a deal with Sutton Harbour Group to construct a year-round tourist and leisure complex in Osprey Quay, between Portland Castle and the academy. The £30 million scheme, called \"Castle Court\", includes a hotel, apartments, public areas, a restaurant, shops and other employment space, and is expected to create 300 jobs. A permanent base for the Royal Yachting Association's senior, youth, junior and paralympic national sailing squads is to be provided.\n\nSince opening the academy has hosted national and international sailing events, including the J/24 World Championships in 2005, staging trials for the 2004 Athens Olympics, the ISAF World Championship 2006, the BUCS Fleet Racing Championships, and the RYA Youth National Championships. Local events are also held at the academy; nearby schools have extra-curricular sailing lessons, and in October each year WPNSA hosts Weymouth Speed Week. The British Olympic Sailing Team train at WPNSA.\n\nIn 2005, the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy (WPNSA) was chosen as the venue for the sailing competition at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. WPNSA was chosen to host these events due to its existing World class facilities. The Olympic Delivery Authority has built upon these facilities providing a new 220m slipway accessible at all states of tide and wind, an additional 70 marina berths and an extended dinghy park with capacity for 600 boats. In addition, the Academy provides direct access to Portland Harbour and Weymouth Bay which have been credited as some of the best sailing waters in the World. Olympic sailing events took place between 28 July and 11 August 2012, and Paralympic events between 31 August and 5 September. One course was in Portland Harbour and four in Weymouth Bay. Sailors from all over the world competed for 30 medals in the Olympic Games and 18 medals in the Paralympic Games. A cruise liner berthed at Portland Port was used as accommodation.\n\nThe academy is around from the Olympic Zone in central London. There was concern about the logistics of transporting athletes from London to the academy, as there is no motorway in Dorset, and transport links are already often congested in summer. Weymouth and Portland Borough Council lobbied the Department for Transport to reinstate double track between Moreton and Dorchester South on the South Western Main Line and increase services from Weymouth railway station to London Waterloo and Bristol, and to introduce new direct services to Exeter. Services to London Waterloo began running every 30 minutes from December 2007, but services through Bristol to Cardiff were stopped. On 5 April 2007, Dorset County Council granted planning permission for a relief road scheme to alleviate congestion between Weymouth and Dorchester, which includes a single carriageway running north of Weymouth, and a 1000-space park-and-ride scheme, costing £84.5 million. Work on the road commenced in 2008, and as anticipated it was completed in three years, in time for the 2012 Olympic sailing events.\n\nThe academy also hosted the Moth World Championships in 2008.\n\nThe Vintage Yachting Games (Vintage) are the International Post-Olympic Yachting/Sailing event for former Olympic classes. The Vintage is held every four years.\n\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2012 Vintage Yachting Games at Lake Como Italy, the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy (WPNSA) was formally announced as the venue for the 2016 Vintage Yachting Games.\n\n"}

This construction can be carried out geometrically in the three-dimensional Euclidean space R. A solenoid is a one-dimensional homogeneous indecomposable continuum that has the structure of a compact topological group.\n\nIn the special case where all \"n\" have the same value \"n\", so that the inverse system is determined by the multiplication by \"n\" self map of the circle, solenoids were first introduced by Vietoris for \"n\" = 2 and by van Dantzig for an arbitrary \"n\". Such a solenoid arises as a one-dimensional expanding attractor, or Smale–Williams attractor, and forms an important example in the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems.\n\nEach solenoid may be constructed as the intersection of a nested system of embedded solid tori in R.\n\nFix a sequence of natural numbers {\"n\"}, \"n\" ≥ 2. Let \"T\" = \"S\" × \"D\" be a solid torus. For each \"i\" ≥ 0, choose a solid torus \"T\" that is wrapped longitudinally \"n\" times inside the solid torus \"T\". Then their intersection\n\nis homeomorphic to the solenoid constructed as the inverse limit of the system of circles with the maps determined by the sequence {\"n\"}.\n\nHere is a variant of this construction isolated by Stephen Smale as an example of an expanding attractor in the theory of smooth dynamical systems. Denote the angular coordinate on the circle \"S\" by \"t\" (it is defined mod 2π) and consider the complex coordinate \"z\" on the two-dimensional unit disk \"D\". Let \"f\" be the map of the solid torus \"T\" = \"S\" × \"D\" into itself given by the explicit formula\n\nThis map is a smooth embedding of \"T\" into itself that preserves the foliation by meridional disks (the constants 1/2 and 1/4 are somewhat arbitrary, but it is essential that 1/4 < 1/2 and 1/4 + 1/2 < 1). If \"T\" is imagined as a rubber tube, the map \"f\" stretches it in the longitudinal direction, contracts each meridional disk, and wraps the deformed tube twice inside \"T\" with twisting, but without self-intersections. The hyperbolic set \"Λ\" of the discrete dynamical system (\"T\", \"f\") is the intersection of the sequence of nested solid tori described above, where \"T\" is the image of \"T\" under the \"i\"th iteration of the map \"f\". This set is a one-dimensional (in the sense of topological dimension) attractor, and the dynamics of \"f\" on \"Λ\" has the following interesting properties:\n\n\nGeneral theory of solenoids and expanding attractors, not necessarily one-dimensional, was developed by R. F. Williams and involves a projective system of infinitely many copies of a compact branched manifold in place of the circle, together with an expanding self-immersion.\n\nSolenoids are compact metrizable spaces that are connected, but not locally connected or path connected. This is reflected in their pathological behavior with respect to various homology theories, in contrast with the standard properties of homology for simplicial complexes. In Čech homology, one can construct a non-exact long homology sequence using a solenoid. In Steenrod-style homology theories, the 0th homology group of a solenoid may have a fairly complicated structure, even though a solenoid is a connected space.\n\nSolenoids whose formula_3 have the same value formula_4 are known as formula_4-adic solenoids formula_6. \n\nA ring structure could be defined on formula_6 in one of two ways: as the direct product of the circle ring formula_8 and the ring of p-adic integers formula_9, or in a process similar to the algebraic construction of the p-adic numbers by inverse limits as follows:\n\nWe start with the inverse limit of the rings\n\nEvery real number when expressed in base formula_4 defines such a sequence by and can therefore be regarded as a -adic solenoid. For example, in this case tau as a 2-adic solenoid would be written as the sequence (0.2831853071..., 0.2831853071..., 2.2831853071..., 6.2831853071..., 6.2831853071..., 6.2831853071..., ...).\n\nThe operators of the ring amount to pointwise addition and multiplication of such sequences. This is well defined because addition and multiplication commute with the \"\" operator; see modular arithmetic. \n\nAs a result, -adic solenoids have a base formula_4 doubly infinite positional notation representation, similar to p-adic integers or real numbers.\n\nA profinite real number is an element of the ring\nwhere formula_13 indicates the profinite completion of formula_14, the index \"p\" runs over all prime numbers, and formula_6 is the \"p\"-adic solenoid.\n\n\n"}

He played quarterback in college at Iowa for Hayden Fry and professionally with the Detroit Lions and the Los Angeles Rams. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999. After his professional career, Long was an assistant coach at Iowa and Oklahoma before serving as the head football coach at San Diego State. Long also held a position as the offensive coordinator for the Kansas Jayhawks under head coach Turner Gill. Long is the CEO and Executive Director of the Iowa Sports Foundation, the organization that runs the Iowa Games, the Senior Games, Adaptive Sports Iowa, Iowa Corporate Games and the Live Healthy Iowa challenge, as well as an analyst for the Big Ten Network.\n\nBorn in Norman, Oklahoma, and raised in Wheaton, Illinois, Long attended Wheaton North High School and played football, basketball and baseball under Jim Rexilius. He led his team to the 1979 state title in football as the starting quarterback and was named to the all-state championship squad. Long also gathered all-state honors in 1980.\n\nStill, Long was not heavily recruited out of high school, as Long averaged only five to six pass attempts per game. As a result, he did not receive his first recruiting call until Thanksgiving of his senior year. Just three schools looked into offering him a scholarship: Northern Illinois, Northwestern, and Iowa. Long eventually accepted a scholarship to play at Iowa for future Hall of Fame coach Hayden Fry.\n\nLong redshirted for the Iowa Hawkeyes in 1981. However, the redshirting rule was new, so Long was only able to take a couple of snaps during his redshirt season. The current redshirt rule (2018) allows a player to participate in up to four games during his/her redshirt season and retain a year of eligibility. While Long played very sparingly in 1981, he did run a couple of plays at the very end of the 1982 Rose Bowl; because of this, he later became the only College Football Player to ever play in five bowl games.\n\nBefore the 1982 season, Hayden Fry said that Long was \"destined for greatness\", which was a bold statement considering that Long was so lightly recruited out of high school. Long started in the first game of the 1982 season, but he was benched for a game after a loss to Nebraska. He was reinserted as a starter in the third game of the 1982 season and led Iowa to a win over Arizona. Long never lost his starting spot again while at Iowa.\n\nLong threw for 1,374 yards and eight touchdowns as a freshman. It was the third most passing yardage in a single season ever at Iowa, behind Gary Snook and Larry Lawrence. His 64.2 completion percentage was a school record. Iowa had a 7–4 record before defeating Tennessee in the 1982 Peach Bowl. Long was the offensive player of the game after completing 19 of 26 passes for a career-high 304 yards.\n\nAs a sophomore in 1983, Long passed for a school record 345 yards in a 42–35 win at Penn State. A few weeks later, he completed just 12 of 27 passes in a loss to Illinois; it would be the only time in his college career as a starter that he failed to complete at least half of his passes. The following week against Northwestern, Long broke his own school record for passing yards and helped Iowa set a new conference record with 713 yards of total offense. He accounted for 398 yards of total offense, also a school record. By the end of his sophomore year, Long owned Iowa's school records for yards passing in a season and a career, touchdown passes in a season and a career, and total offense in a season and a career. He led Iowa to a 9–2 record in the 1983 season and a berth in the Gator Bowl after being named first team all-Big Ten.\n\nLong was again an all-Big Ten selection as a junior in 1984, as he finished first in the Big Ten in passing efficiency. Long completed 22 consecutive passes against Indiana, setting an NCAA record. He also finished seventh in the Heisman Trophy balloting as a junior. Iowa had a 7–4–1 record after the 1984 regular season and accepted an invitation to the Freedom Bowl against Texas.\n\nA windy, rainy day did not slow Long in what some felt might be his final college game. Iowa destroyed Texas, 55–17, the second most points ever scored against Texas and the most in 80 years. Long broke a 24–17 game at halftime wide open by completing 12 of 14 passes for 241 yards and four touchdowns in the third quarter alone. For the game, Long was offensive MVP as he completed a school record 29 passes in 39 attempts for a bowl record 461 yards and a bowl record 6 touchdowns.\n\nAfter much consideration, Long delighted Iowa Hawkeye fans by declaring that he would return for his senior season. He became an instant Heisman Trophy candidate, and Iowa was a preseason top five team. After three weeks in 1985, the Hawkeyes ascended to #1 in the national rankings.\n\nIn Iowa's first game at #1, the Hawkeyes played Michigan State. A seesaw game had Michigan State leading, 31–28, in the waning minutes. Long drove Iowa the length of the field, and the Hawkeyes faced fourth and goal from the two-yard line with just 27 seconds remaining. Since college football had no overtime rule at the time, Iowa needed to go for the touchdown and the win rather than attempt a tie. Long faked a handoff to running back Ronnie Harmon and then ran to his right. His fake had fooled the Spartan defenders, and Long ran into the endzone, holding the ball high above his head as he crossed the goal line to give Iowa a 35–31 victory. He completed a school record 30 passes on 39 attempts for 380 yards and scored five touchdowns (four passing and the game winning score rushing) in the game.\n\nTwo weeks later, #1 Iowa faced #2 Michigan in Kinnick Stadium. Iowa trailed 10–9 as the Hawkeyes regained possession of the football at their own 22-yard line with just 5:27 remaining in the game. Long led Iowa on a 66-yard drive against the nation's top-ranked defense, twice converting third-and-eight situations by completing passes to tight end Mike Flagg. Long drove the Iowa team to the 12-yard line with two seconds remaining to set up kicker Rob Houghtlin's game-winning field goal as time expired. Long completed 26 of 39 passes for 297 yards in Iowa's 12–10 win.\n\nA loss to Ohio State cost Iowa their #1 ranking, but the Hawkeyes still won the Big Ten title outright for the first time in 27 years. Long won many major national awards as a senior, including the 1985 Maxwell Award, given to the nation's top player and the Davey O'Brien Award, given to the nation's top quarterback. He was the Big Ten Player of the Year and a consensus first team All-American. Finally, Long was the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy to Bo Jackson of Auburn in the second closest race in the award's history, losing by just 45 points.\n\nThough Iowa lost in Long's final game in the 1986 Rose Bowl, the loophole with the redshirting rule allowed Long to play in his fifth bowl game. He is believed to be the only collegiate player to participate in five bowl games.\n\nLong's Iowa teams compiled a 35–13–1 record. He graduated with 10,461 passing yards and 74 touchdowns on 782 completions. He held every passing record at the University of Iowa except one (passes attempted in a game) when he graduated. Long holds the best completion percentage of any college quarterback all-time who has attempted more than 1,000 career passes. He was also the first Big Ten player and just the second player in college football history to throw for more than 10,000 yards in a career. The first was Doug Flutie. Long was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nOn December 12, 2014 the Big Ten Network included Long on \"The Mount Rushmore of Iowa Football\", as chosen by online fan voting. Long was joined in the honor by Nile Kinnick, Alex Karras and Tim Dwight. Of the honor, Long told \"BTN Live\" host Mike Hall: \"It's a great honor. It was a great time to be a Hawkeye during those years. I'm very honored to be on that list.\"\n\nDrafted #12 overall by the Detroit Lions in the 1986 NFL Draft, Long's NFL career was disappointing. During Long's rookie season in the NFL, he was called into a game after an injury suffered by then-starting quarterback Joe Ferguson. His best season was 1987, in which he threw 2,598 yards, 11 touchdowns and 20 interceptions. Long played for the Lions from 1986–1989 before being traded to the Los Angeles Rams in 1990. After one year in Los Angeles, Long returned to Detroit for the 1991 season, though he did not attempt any passes.\n\nLong transitioned to a career as a football coach. He returned to his alma mater in 1995, serving as Iowa's defensive backs coach. Though Long had no coaching experience and had played on the offensive side of the ball for his entire career, he quickly became a respected defensive coach. In his three seasons coaching defensive backs from 1995–1997, Iowa posted a 24–12 record and advanced to a bowl game all three years. Iowa led the nation in interceptions returned for touchdowns in 1995, while the 1997 squad led the Big Ten in interceptions.\n\nLong switched to coaching Iowa's quarterbacks and special teams in 1998. After the 1998 season, Iowa coach Hayden Fry retired, and though Long was considered for the job, Fry was ultimately succeeded by Kirk Ferentz. Ferentz retained Long from Fry's staff, and Long served Ferentz in the same capacity for the 1999 season.\n\nAfter five seasons coaching at Iowa, Long left the Hawkeyes to become the quarterbacks coach at Oklahoma. Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops and Long were teammates on Iowa's 1982 Rose Bowl team. Long was an assistant on the Oklahoma team that claimed the 2000 Bowl Championship Series national title. He coached quarterback Josh Heupel to a second-place finish in the Heisman Trophy balloting that year.\n\nAfter the 2001 season, Long was promoted to Oklahoma's offensive coordinator position. Oklahoma won the Rose Bowl following the 2002 season, and in 2003, the Sooners set a Big 12 Conference record by averaging 51.5 points per game.\n\nIn 2004, Long was named as a finalist for the Broyles Award as the nation's top assistant coach. He was an assistant coach at Oklahoma for six seasons, including four as an offensive coordinator, and Oklahoma compiled a 67–11 record during his time there.\n\nAfter the 2005 season, Long landed his first head coaching position when he was hired as the 16th head football coach at San Diego State University. Long had a record of 9–27 in three seasons as SDSU's head coach. On November 23, 2008, college president Stephen Weber announced that Athletic Director Jeff Schemmel had dismissed Long prior to the final game of the season. Coach Long finished his third season only winning 2 out of 12 games, including the one conference win on his final night. San Diego State finished the 2008 season with a 2–10 record, the first and only ten-loss season in school history. Long also had the distinction of having his team lose two games to Division 1-AA Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (in his first and third seasons with the Aztecs, respectively).\n\nLong was offensive coordinator for the Kansas Jayhawks. Long became part of the coaching staff under head coach Turner Gill after the departure of Mark Mangino, Long's former co-worker at Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2012, Long became receivers coach at Norman High School in Norman, Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2019, Long was hired by the St. Louis BattleHawks of the XFL as running backs coach. He was promoted to offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach on January 11, 2020.\n\nLong and his wife, Lisa have three daughters; Lindsay, Samantha, and Maddy, and two sons; Nathan and Zachary.\n\n"}

{"id": "2217738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217738", "title": "Frestonia", "text": "Frestonia\n\nFrestonia was the name adopted by the residents of Freston Road, London, when they attempted to secede from the United Kingdom in 1977 to form the Free and Independent Republic of Frestonia. The residents were squatters, many of whom eventually set up a housing co-op in negotiation with Notting Hill Housing Trust, and included artists, musicians, writers, actors and activists. Actor David Rappaport was the Foreign Minister, while playwright Heathcote Williams served as Ambassador to the United Kingdom.\n\nFrestonia consisted of a triangle of land (including communal gardens) formed by Freston Road, Bramley Road and Shalfleet Drive, W10, which belonged at the time to the London Borough of Hammersmith. This land crosses the boundary of London postal districts W10 (North Kensington) and W11 (Notting Hill), and now belongs to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.\n\nPrior to the construction of the Westway, Freston Road had been called Latimer Road, and the nearby tube station still bears the former name.\n\nMost of the residents of Freston Road were squatters, who moved into empty houses in the early 1970s. The 'Republic of Frestonia' continued to operate as a collective well into the 1980s, becoming a creative hub for writers, artists and musicians as well as cultural activists. When the Greater London Council planned to redevelop the area, the 120 residents first all adopted the same surname of Bramley with the aim that the council would then have to re-house them collectively.\n\nThe Council threatened formal eviction, so at a public meeting attended by 200 people, resident Nicholas Albery—inspired by both the Ealing comedy film \"Passport to Pimlico\" and a previous visit to Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen—suggested that they declare the street independent of the rest of the UK. A referendum returned 94% of residents in favour of the plan, and 73% in favour of joining the European Economic Community. Independence was declared on 31 October 1977. Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe wrote expressing his support, saying \"As one who had childhood enthusiasm for \"Napoleon of Notting Hill\", I can hardly fail to be moved by your aspirations\". In a legal dispute regarding the unauthorised performance of his play \"The Immortalist\", Heathcote Williams won a ruling from the UK courts that Frestonia was for this purpose not part of the UK.\n\nThe state adopted the Latin motto \"Nos Sumus Una Familia\"—\"We are All One Family\"—and applied to join the United Nations, at the same time warning that peacekeeping troops might be needed to keep the GLC at bay.\n\nFrestonia had its own flag; postage stamps (which were honoured by the General Post Office); passport stamps for visitors; a national newspaper \"The Tribal Messenger\"; as well as an art gallery \"The Car Breaker Gallery\".\n\nThe Car Breaker Gallery's exhibitors included Joe Rush of the Mutoid Waste Company, Julie Umerle, Brett Ewins, Giles Leaman and Brendan McCarthy. The gallery opened to the public at 4 Bramley Road on 14 December 1979. In 1980, conceptual artist John Latham was a member of the audience at the private view of one of the performances presented there. Professional lighting for the gallery was donated by Sandy Nairne, later to be Director of the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nFrestonia street art included a whale on Stoneleigh Street and a performance of Apocalypse Now on bicycles.\n\nIn addition, there was a \"National Theatre\" at Frestonia which performed Heathcote Williams's \"The Immortalist\". The Frestonian National Film Institute was also formed; its first screening being—appropriately—\"Passport to Pimlico\" and a film of the Sex Pistols.\n\nLocal transport was served by the Number 295 bus, and the London Underground, Latimer Road underground station being at the north end of Bramley Road.\n\nThere were even plans to introduce a currency.\n\nWhen the state celebrated its fifth anniversary in 1982, the population numbered 97 people occupying 23 houses. The same year, The Clash recorded their album \"Combat Rock\" in Ear Studios (also known as The People's Hall) in Frestonia. The Clash and Motörhead practised in the rehearsal studios there. Killing Joke and GirlsSchool also practised there. \nFollowing international press coverage, the residents formed the Bramleys Housing Co-operative Ltd, which negotiated with Notting Hill Housing Trust for continued residence and acceptable redevelopment of the site. Some Frestonians were unhappy with the consequent loss of independence and moved away. According to Tony Sleep, a resident photographer whose online photo-journal documents the history of the area, those leaving were often replaced by people with drinking and drug problems. The remaining Frestonians proved incapable of maintaining the ideals of the Frestonian \"nation,\" which consequently went into decline. In its place, a more conventional local community developed, without any claims to secession from the UK.\n\nBramleys Housing Co-operative manages the properties owned and built on the Frestonia site by Notting Hill Housing Trust, and its members live as a close-knit community. Some are children or grandchildren of the original Frestonians, although there has also been a significant influx of new residents.\n\nA large new office development, also named Frestonia, was built on the adjacent site at the junction of Bramley Road and St Anns Road, and is occupied by the headquarters of Cath Kidston. A second large office development also named Frestonia by its developers was erected at 125/135 Freston Road in 2001.\n\nMajor developments occurred in the 2000s with the completion of headquarters for Monsoon Accessorize (2007) and TalkTalk (2009) at the rear of 91–121 Freston Road. The Louise T Blouin Foundation (2006) was built in nearby Olaf Street. The nearby 150,000 m Westfield London shopping complex opened in 2008.\n\n\n"}

During maturation in the bone marrow, late erythroblasts normally expel their nuclei; but, in some cases, a small portion of DNA remains. Its presence usually signifies a damaged or absent spleen, because a healthy spleen would normally filter this type of red blood cell.\n\nThe Howell–Jolly body is named after William Henry Howell and Justin Marie Jolly.\n\nThis DNA appears as a basophilic (purple) spot on the otherwise eosinophilic (pink) erythrocyte on a standard H&E stained blood smear. These inclusions are normally removed by the spleen during erythrocyte circulation, but will persist in individuals with functional hyposplenia or asplenia.\n\nHowell–Jolly bodies are seen with markedly decreased splenic function. Common causes include asplenia (post-splenectomy) or congenital absence of spleen (heterotaxy syndrome with asplenia). Spleens are also removed for therapeutic purposes in conditions like hereditary spherocytosis, trauma to the spleen, and autosplenectomy caused by sickle cell anemia. Other causes are radiation therapy involving the spleen, such as that used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nHowell–Jolly bodies are also seen in amyloidosis, severe hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

{"id": "2217742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217742", "title": "Fall Out (The Prisoner)", "text": "Fall Out (The Prisoner)\n\n\"Fall Out\" is the 17th and final episode of the allegorical British science fiction series \"The Prisoner\". It was written and directed by Patrick McGoohan who also portrayed the incarcerated Number Six. The episode was first broadcast in the UK on ITV (Scottish Television) on Thursday 1 February 1968 (it appeared on ATV Midlands and Grampian the day after) and first aired in the United States on CBS on 21 September 1968.\n\nThe episode omits the usual long opening sequence in favour of a recap of the penultimate episode, \"Once Upon a Time\". It is the only episode in the series in which the show's principal outdoors location, Portmeirion, is given a specific credit in the opening titles. This resulted from an agreement with Portmeirion's architect, Sir Clough Williams-Ellis, that the location would not be revealed until the series finale.\n\n\"Fall Out\" generated controversy on its original transmission owing to the obscurity and ambiguity of the instalment's last twenty minutes. This reaction forced McGoohan to go into hiding for a period of time because he was being hounded at his own home by baffled viewers demanding explanations.\n\nAfter besting Number Two at a battle of wills in \"Once Upon a Time\" at the apparent cost of Number Two's life, Number Six requests he be taken to see Number One. He is taken by The Supervisor to a large cavernous chamber that includes a British assembly hall with a number of masked delegates, whom the Supervisor joins, and a large metallic cylinder with a mechanical eye, labelled \"1\". Number Six is shown to his seat, a large ornate throne, to watch the proceedings.\n\nA master of ceremonies (\"the President\") announces Number Six has passed the \"ultimate test\" and won the \"right to be individual\", but there are matters of ceremony involved in the \"transfer of ultimate power\". The caged room where Number Two died is brought to the chamber with his body still in it; medical personnel recover the body, resuscitate him, and give Two a make-over. Number Two along with Number Forty-eight — a young modishly-dressed man — are presented as two different examples of \"revolt\" to the assembly. Number Forty-eight refuses to cooperate and drives the assembly to sing a rendition of \"Dem Bones\" before he is restrained. Number Two reveals he too was abducted to the Village and spits at the mechanical eye in defiance. Both men are taken away.\n\nThe President then presents Number Six as a third form of revolt, but as \"a revolutionary of a different calibre\" to be treated with respect. Number Six is shown his home in London is being prepared for his return, and he is presented with a million in traveller's cheques, petty cash, a passport, and the keys to his home and car. The President says Number Six is free to go home or go wherever he wants, but requests that Number Six stay and lead them as his behaviour has been so exemplary. The President then asks Number Six to address the assembly, but as he begins each sentence with \"I\" the assembly drowns him out with shouts of \"Aye! Aye! Aye!...\" \n\nNumber Six is shown into the metallic cylinder. He passes transparent tubes holding Numbers Two and Forty-eight along with a third, empty tube, each labelled as \"Orbit\". Climbing a stairway, he finds a robed man in a mask watching surveillance videos of Number Six. Number Six pulls off the mask to find a gorilla mask underneath, and then under that, a man seemingly identical to Number Six. The robed figure escapes into a hatch above. Number Six locks the hatch and recognises the cylinder is a rocket like the one in \"The Girl Who Was Death\". He initiates its countdown, sending the President and Assembly into a panic, and an evacuation of the Village is ordered.\n\nNumber Six frees Numbers Two and Forty-eight, and along with the Butler, they gun down armed guards, making their way to the caged room which is revealed to be on the bed of a Scammell Highwayman low loader. They drive away from the Village as the rocket launches from the abandoned Village. Rover (the security of the Village) deflates and is destroyed (to the accompaniment of \"I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi (I Like You Very Much)\") upon exposure to the flames of the rocket's exhaust.\n\nThe four drive towards London. Nearing the city, Number Forty-eight alights and proceeds to hitch-hike. Just outside the Palace of Westminster, the truck is stopped by the police. The three abandon it and leave their separate ways. Number Two enters the Palace by the Peers' Entrance, while the Butler escorts Number Six back to his home, where his Lotus 7 car waits. Number Six sets off in his car, while the Butler enters Number Six's home, its door opening in the same manner as the automatic doors in the Village. The episode ends with the thunder claps from the series' opening sequence, as well as with the opening shot of Number Six driving on an open country road.\n\n\nThe allegorical shift that takes place once the identity of Number One is revealed has been subjected to various interpretations. McGoohan himself commented that it means to say that \"Each man is a prisoner unto himself\". The episode's ending, with Six's apartment door opening automatically, as in the Village, suggests that he is still not free. The final scene, being the same as the first scene of the series, implies that the series is a cycle that is about to repeat itself, supporting the idea that Six cannot be free from captivity. McGoohan commented on the final scene that it is meant to show that \"freedom is a myth,\" and there is no final conclusion to the series because \"we continue to be prisoners\".\n\nLead star and series creator Patrick McGoohan wrote and directed the episode. As ITC managing director Lew Grade said in the 1984 documentary \"Six into One: The Prisoner File\", McGoohan, despite having promised earlier that he would conceive an ending for the series, came to him admitting that he was unable to come up with an ending. The biggest problem was revealing the identity of Number One, which, as McGoohan and various other crew members admitted, had not been decided on prior to the writing of the final episode's script.\nAccording to the book \"The Prisoner\" by Robert Fairclough, McGoohan was informed that production was cancelled on the series immediately following filming of the preceding episode to be produced, \"The Girl Who Was Death\", and was given only a week to write a finale to conclude the storyline started in \"Once Upon a Time\", which had been filmed a year earlier. Fairclough's account is, however, in contradiction to virtually all others, which state that McGoohan knew when he left for America to act in the Hollywood film, \"Ice Station Zebra\", that there would be only four more episodes produced from that point, starting with \"Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling\" during his absence and ending with a finale; indeed, most agree that this last happened because a scheduled production break was scrapped when two series of 13 episodes were reduced to one of seventeen due to ITC chief Lew Grade deciding that the actor/producer was taking too long and spending too much money.\n\nIn order to save time and cut costs, \"Fall Out\" reused several sets from \"Girl\", most notably the rocket control room. Two guest actors from the episode, Kenneth Griffith and Alexis Kanner, were also recruited to play different characters in \"Fall Out\". This was, in fact, Kanner's third appearance on the series in only a few weeks; he had previously played Number Eight alias \"The Kid/Number 8\" in the Western themed episode \"Living in Harmony\" as well as his uncredited role of the Photographer in \"Girl\". According to both Fairclough and Kenneth Griffith himself, McGoohan was so pressed for time that the actor was asked to write his own dialogue. While Leo McKern's Number Two is the same character that previously appeared, Kanner's Number 48 is almost certainly a different character from those he played in \"Living in Harmony\" (where his character in fact dies) and \"The Girl Who Was Death\", but it is unclear whether Griffith's character is the same one that was the Number Two in the latter episode. It was, however, not unusual in \"The Prisoner\" for actors to play different characters in different episodes.\n\nMcGoohan receives no onscreen acting credit in this episode. The episode opens with the series title superimposed over the first moments of the \"Once Upon a Time\" recap, with the location credit, episode title, guest stars, David Tomblin's producer credit and McGoohan's \"written and directed by\" credit over aerial footage of Portmeirion following that sequence. At the end, after the names of Kanner, McKern, and Muscat appear as captions over the actors themselves (still in character), an extreme aerial shot of the Lotus on London streets (the driver is not actually recognisable) is captioned simply, \"Prisoner\". Nor does McGoohan receive his usual executive producer credit; in \"The Girl Who Was Death\" it is replaced with a large \"Patrick McGoohan as The Prisoner\" credit, but here his name appears onscreen only as writer/director.\n\n\nThe broadcast date of the episode varied in different ITV regions of the UK. The episode was first shown on Scottish Television on Thursday 1 February 1968, on Friday 2 February on ATV Midlands and Grampian Television, on Sunday 4 February on ATV London, whose broadcasts were also taken up by Southern Television, Westward Television and Tyne-Tees; on Friday 9 February on Border Television, on Saturday 10 February on Anglia Television and on Friday 1 March on Granada Television in the North West. The aggregate viewing figures for the ITV regions that debuted the season in 1967 have been estimated at 9.8 million. In Northern Ireland, the episode did not debut until Saturday 13 April 1968, and in Wales, the episode was not broadcast until Wednesday 15 April 1970.\n\nAt the time \"Fall Out\" was first broadcast, there were only three television channels available in the UK and it was claimed that the long-awaited final episode of the series had one of the largest ever viewing audiences yet seen. However, this seems unlikely given that, like other ITC programmes, the show was screened in the various ITV regions at varying times on varying days; it was not networked. As home video was unavailable at the time, some viewers missed the fleeting glimpse of Number One's face, which was only four seconds long.\n\nThe finale intentionally avoided answering any mysteries regarding the origins of the Village, its intentions for Number Six, his reasons for resigning and there is also no clear explanation for why the Village releases Number Six. The episode depicts Numbers Six, Two, 48 and the Butler shooting their way out of the Village; this is in stark contradiction to the previously established absence of weapons in the Village and its impenetrable security. The Village's proximity to London in the finale is also unexplained. This resulted in bafflement and anger among the show's viewership to such an extent that McGoohan had to leave the country and go \"into hiding\" for a few days as dissatisfied viewers stormed his house.\n\nDespite this, McGoohan stated in a 1977 interview that he was \"delighted\" with the reaction, as his intention was to create controversy. He explained that his enjoyment with the outrage was in line with the show's message, \"as long as people feel something, that's the great thing, it's when they're walking around not thinking, not feeling, that's though, that's where all the dangerous stuff is, cause when you get a mob like that, you can turn them in to the sort of gang that Hitler had\". The popular press joined in with the public indignation at this \"rubbish\" McGoohan had foisted on them. Although it is sometimes claimed that McGoohan never worked in the UK again after this, this is untrue as, for example, he starred in the Channel 4 production \"The Best of Friends\" (1991), and also appeared in the film \"Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1971), which was partially filmed in the UK. He did, however, tend to work in American television hereafter, including a \"Prisoner\"-tinged appearance on \"Columbo\" a few years later.\n\nIn 2001, \"TV Guide\" listed \"Fall Out\" as the 55th Greatest TV Episode of All Time.\n\nThere have been two licensed sequels to this episode in other media.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2217743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217743", "title": "Emerson, Manitoba", "text": "Emerson, Manitoba\n\nEmerson is an unincorporated community recognized as a local urban district in south central Manitoba, Canada, located within the Municipality of Emerson – Franklin. It has a population of 655.\n\nEmerson, named after writer Ralph Waldo Emerson, is located 96 kilometers south of Winnipeg along the Red River, just north of the United States border at the point where the province of Manitoba and states of Minnesota and North Dakota meet. The community is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Montcalm in Manitoba, Pembina County in North Dakota, and Kittson County in Minnesota. The towns of St. Vincent, Minnesota and Pembina, North Dakota are located just a few kilometers south of the border in the United States. The unincorporated community of Noyes, Minnesota lies immediately across the border from Emerson, however the border crossing between the two is now closed.\n\nThe principal roads serving Emerson are Highway 75, which runs from the border north to Winnipeg, and Provincial Road 200, which begins at Highway 75, which runs through the community and north to Winnipeg along the east side of the Red River.\n\nThe border crossing at Emerson, Manitoba and Pembina, North Dakota is the fifth busiest along the Canada–United States border, and the second busiest west of the Great Lakes. It is part of a large trade corridor that links the Canadian prairies with the United States and Mexico. Annual cross-border trade is valued at approximately $14 billion CAD. The ports of entry on both sides are open 24 hours and offer full border services. An estimated one million people pass through the border crossing each year.\n\nFor many years, Emerson was among very few communities in Canada to have multiple border crossings, as it was serviced by both the current port of entry (originally designated as West Lynne) and the now-closed Emerson East port of entry opposite Noyes, Minnesota. In its original configuration, Highway 75 came from the north, crossed the river at Emerson and ended at the Emerson East crossing, then the more commonly used border crossing, where it continued south as U.S. Route 75. Travelers wishing to enter North Dakota would have to turn south at an intersection about 0.5 kilometers north of the border onto a short road (later designated as Highway 29) leading to the Manitoba-North Dakota border and then continue south on U.S. Route 81.\n\nThe importance of Emerson East crossing began to decline after Interstate 29 superseded U.S. 81 in 1957. The Highway 75/29 junction was rebuilt in the 1980s to direct through traffic to the West Lynne-Pembina crossing, making it the new primary border crossing. Travelers wanting to continue on Highway 75 were afterwards required to turn east at the junction. Use of the Emerson East port of entry dwindled, which prompted the Canadian government to close it in 2003, leaving that crossing open to U.S. bound traffic only. The crossing was completely barricaded when the American government closed the Noyes port of entry three years later and the Manitoba government formally re-designated Highway 75 to its current configuration and eliminated PTH 29 in 2012. The Highway 75 at Emerson is currently being redeveloped in order to accommodate expansion of the Emerson port of entry.\n\nSouth of Emerson, two major U.S. rail lines, the BNSF Railway (Formerly the Great Northern Railway) and the Soo Line Railroad cross the border and are met, respectively, by the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways. There are customs inspection facilities for both lines on both sides of the border.\n\nSince 2017, with the passage of Donald Trump's Executive Order 13769, Emerson has seen a large influx of immigrants walking across the border to apply for asylum. Many of them have found assistance with the Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council. In 2018, Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez began a series of visits to immigrant communities, warning potential border crossers that those who do not qualify for refugee status could be returned to their countries of origin rather than the United States.\n\nIn 1873, American businessmen Thomas Carney and William Fairbanks, following advice from railroad entrepreneur James J. Hill, received a grant from the Province of Manitoba for 640 acres along the east side of the Red River near the Canada–United States border. Hill had advised Carney and Fairbanks that the area had significant potential to become a railway hub for the region. The existing settlement of West Lynne on the west side of the river had already established itself as a key point along the trading routes between Winnipeg and St. Paul, Minnesota. With the emergence of railroads during this time, the addition of their own railway would bring great economic prosperity.\n\nIn 1874, the two men led a group of 100 who formed the new settlement of Emerson, which was named after writer and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. With the promise that Emerson could be the new \"gateway to the west\", the settlement grew quickly and, by 1876, a church and a school were built.\n\nManitoba's first railway, the Emerson Line, which ran along the east side of the Red River from St. Boniface to Emerson was completed in 1878. Soon after, the railway from St. Paul to St. Vincent, Minnesota was completed and the two lines were connected. The arrival of the railway to Emerson brought prosperity, and instantly elevated Emerson's status as one of Manitoba's most important settlements.\n\nEmerson was originally incorporated as a town in 1879. Over the next four years, the community experienced a boom. Its population swelled to over 10,000 and in 1883, the community absorbed the neighbouring community of West Lynne. A court house, town hall, and other large, elaborate structures were erected as businesses thrived, thanks to immigrants and travelers from the east stopping in Emerson before embarking west. To help cement its status as \"gateway to the west\", the town negotiated with Canadian Pacific Railway to build a new railway west from Emerson. However, shortly after work on the line began, CPR reconsidered and the railway was never built.\n\nCoupled with the completion of CPR's transcontinental railroad through Winnipeg, the loss of the western railway ended the prospects of Emerson being the \"gateway to the west\", a title that would be bestowed upon Winnipeg. Businesses relocated to Winnipeg and travelers who would previously would have come to Manitoba through Emerson were now taking the new all-Canadian CPR route to Winnipeg and then west. By 1884, only ten years after the settlement was founded, the community was bankrupt. It would take the community years to recover. A fire destroyed the original town hall in 1917. A new town hall was built to replace it, with help from the Manitoba government. Many of the abandoned buildings were eventually destroyed by Red River floods, while others were removed to make way for the dike that was constructed around the community.\n\nFrom around 1936 to 1956, Emerson obtained its power across the border from a long 2400-volt distribution circuit originating from Pembina. This line was initially operated by the Interstate Power Company and was sold to the Otter Tail Power Company in 1944. In 1956, the town made arrangements to obtain its electrical needs from Manitoba Hydro and the cross-border distribution line was removed.\n\nOn January 1, 2015, the town and neighbouring Rural Municipality of Franklin were amalgamated by direction of the provincial government to create the Municipality of Emerson – Franklin. Following the merger, the former Town of Emerson was designated as a local urban district within the new municipality and allotted two seats on the municipal council.\n\nToday, Emerson has a population just under 700. The community still attracts many visitors each year who pass through the Port of Entry at Emerson. There are still some landmarks remaining from Emerson's \"golden age\", such as the courthouse, jail, and home of William Fairbanks, as well as the West Lynne post office and original customs house. The courthouse, which is designated as a historical landmark, is still in use today.\n\nWest Lynne was established in the early 1870s by the Hudson's Bay Company, next to their North Pembina post, prior to which the company had operated a post at Fort Pembina two miles to the south, in American territory. After losing the fort in a Fenian raid in 1871, they withdrew and established the post inside Canadian territory.\n\nA post office, telegraph station, and customs house were soon constructed at West Lynne, making it a key point along the Red River trade routes for both river and land traffic.\n\nAfter the railway to Emerson was completed in 1878, the importance of West Lynne diminished. In 1883, West Lynne and Emerson were amalgamated into one municipality, retaining the name Emerson. The Canadian port of entry on the west side of the river was officially known as West Lynne to distinguish it from the Emerson East port on east side until the Canadian government closed Emerson East in 2003 to consolidate operations.\n\nThe original customs house and post office at West Lynne still stand about 200 meters from the modern facility used by the Canada Border Services Agency.\n\nThe fort was located on the west side of the Red River, approximately two kilometers north of West Lynne. It was established by the Government of Canada in 1872 as a base for their contingent of the North American Boundary Commission. The commission was tasked with defining and marking the Canada-U.S. border. It later served an immigration station and police post. By 1879, the Canadian government no longer had use for the fort and sold the property.\n\nFort Dufferin is best known as the starting point for the North-West Mounted Police's infamous March West in 1874. This marked the only time the entire force was ever assembled at one place.\n\nToday, the Fort Dufferin site is owned by the Province of Manitoba. A cairn and plaque mark the historic site, which is open to the public during the summer.\n\nEmerson is located at the far southwest corner of the federal riding of Provencher, which is represented by Ted Falk. At the provincial level, the community is represented by Josh Guenter, MLA for the Borderland riding.\n\nThe community's education needs are served by Emerson Elementary School (Kindergarten to Grade 8) and Roseau Valley School (Grades 9-12) in nearby Dominion City. Recreational facilities include an indoor skating rink, curling rink, public golf course, swimming pool, and park. Emerson is also served by a local RCMP detachment and volunteer fire department.\n\nEmerson experiences a humid continental climate (Dfb), and a Plant Hardiness of zone 3b. Along with St. Albans, Emerson holds the record for Manitoba's highest temperature of on 12 July 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 9 February 1899.\n\n\n\n"}

There are separate governing bodies for the sport in the other parts of the United Kingdom.\n\nEngland Hockey was formed on 1 January 2003 to replace the English Hockey Association (EHA) which had had to suspend operations 2002 because of significant financial problems. The English Hockey Association had in turn been formed in 1996 to combine the function of the separate governing bodies for men's, women's and mixed hockey. Following the demise of the EHA, England's international hockey was for a time managed through a separate limited company called World Class Hockey Limited, which was funded entirely by Sport England. These operations were merged back into England Hockey on 1 July 2005. The second tier of hockey administration in England consists of five regional associations: East, Midlands, North, South and West, and county associations below.\n\nEngland Hockey is affiliated to the European Hockey Federation and International Hockey Federation. It runs a number of competitions, including the English Hockey League.\n\nWhile UK hockey is organised by separate bodies for each of the home nations, the United Kingdom is required to enter a combined team in the Olympics. This has created tensions between the governing bodies and those responsible for the Great Britain teams. However the women's team have been performing well, winning a bronze at the Olympic Games in London 2012 and most recently the gold at the Olympic Games on Rio in 2016.\n\nThe current England Men and England Women Hockey teams train at Bisham Abbey National Sport Centre just outside Marlow.\n\nOver 841 clubs across England and the Channel Islands affiliate to England Hockey. The Hockey seasons for clubs are split into the Winter season running from mainly from September to April and the Summer season running from May to August.\n\nFollowing the success in London 2012, the new national stadium for Hockey relocated 500 yards to the Lee Valley Hockey and centre. The first rate facilities at the £30million Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre include two hockey pitches capable of seating 3,000 and can be scaled up to 15,000 with temporary overlay. Lee Valley has already hosted the European Hockey Championships in 2015 and the Women's Champions Trophy Event in 2016, The Men's World League Round 3 in 2017 and the Hockey Women's World Cup in 2018 will also be staged here.\n\nUntil early 2009, England Hockey was based at the former, purpose-built, former England National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes, but the cost of running the stadium was one of the factors that led to the demise of the English Hockey Association. The ground was leased to Wimbledon (later Milton Keynes Dons) football club in 2003 and has not been used for hockey since then. On 17 December 2009, demolition of the stadium began, the site is now used for a new national HQ for Network Rail.\n\nEngland Hockey runs a series of senior competitions over the course of a year:\n\n\nIn addition to these, there are also several indoor and outdoor junior competitions for both schools and clubs, as well as masters' competitions for over 45s.\n\n\n\nMain England hockey organisations\n"}

{"id": "2217772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217772", "title": "Crush syndrome", "text": "Crush syndrome\n\nCrush syndrome (also traumatic rhabdomyolysis or Bywaters' syndrome) is a medical condition characterized by major shock and kidney failure after a crushing injury to skeletal muscle. Crush \"injury\" is compression of the arms, legs, or other parts of the body that causes muscle swelling and/or neurological disturbances in the affected areas of the body, while crush \"syndrome\" is localized crush injury with systemic manifestations. Cases occur commonly in catastrophes such as earthquakes, to victims that have been trapped under fallen or moving masonry.\n\nVictims of crushing damage present some of the greatest challenges in field medicine, and may be among the few situations where a physician is needed in the field. Appropriate physiological preparation of the injured is mandatory. It may be possible to free the patient without amputation, however, field amputations may be necessary in drastic situations.\n\nSeigo Minami, a Japanese physician, first reported the crush syndrome in 1923. He studied the pathology of three soldiers who died in World War I due to kidney failure. The renal changes were due to the buildup of excess methemoglobin, resulting from the destruction of muscles from lack of oxygen. These changes can also be seen in persons who are buried alive. The progressive acute kidney failure is because of acute tubular necrosis.\n\nThe syndrome was later described by British physician Eric Bywaters in patients during the 1941 London Blitz. It is a reperfusion injury that appears after the release of the crushing pressure. The mechanism is believed to be the release into the bloodstream of muscle breakdown products—notably myoglobin, potassium and phosphorus—that are the products of rhabdomyolysis (the breakdown of skeletal muscle damaged by ischemic conditions).\n\nThe specific action on the kidneys is not understood completely, but may be due partly to nephrotoxic metabolites of myoglobin.\n\nThe most devastating systemic effects can occur when the crushing pressure is suddenly released, without proper preparation of the patient, causing reperfusion syndrome. In addition to tissue directly suffering the crush mechanism, tissue is then subjected to sudden reoxygenation in the limbs and extremities. Without proper preparation, the patient, with pain control, may be cheerful before recovery, but die shortly thereafter. This sudden failure is called the \"smiling death\".\n\nThese systemic effects are caused by a traumatic rhabdomyolysis. As muscle cells die, they absorb sodium, water and calcium; the rhabdomyolysis releases potassium, myoglobin, phosphate, thromboplastin, creatine and creatine kinase.\n\nCrush syndrome can directly come from compartment syndrome, if the injury is left untreated.. Monitor for the classic 5 Ps: pain, pallor, parasthesias(pins and needles), paralysis, and pulselessness.\n\nThere is no distinct treatment option that can undo the effects and damage from Rhabdomyolysis because it is necrosis. However, the rate of the pathology that can lead to more complications can be decreased by acting early and consistently. Overall treatment depends on preventing kidney failure (renal failure) which is done by rehydrating the patient. It also depends on making urine have a more basic pH (alkalinization of urine).\n\nImmediate untreated crush syndrome death is caused by severe head injury, torso injury with damaged abdominal organs, and asphyxia (excessive loss of oxygen). Early untreated crush syndrome death is caused by Hyperkalemia and by Hypovolemic shock. Late untreated crush syndrome death is caused by renal failure, coagulopathy and hemorrhage, and sepsis.\n\nDue to the risk of crush syndrome, current recommendation to nonprofessional first-aiders (in the UK) is to not release victims of crush injury who have been trapped for more than 15 minutes. Treatment consists of not releasing the tourniquet, overloading the patient with fluid using Dextran 4000 iu, and slow release of pressure. If pressure is released during first aid, then fluid is restricted and an input-output chart for the patient is maintained, and proteins are decreased in the diet.\n\nAs mentioned, permissive hypotension (restrictive fluid therapy) is unwise. Careful fluid overload and administration of intravenous sodium bicarbonate is wise, especially if the crushing weight is on the patient for more than 4 hours, but often if it persists more than one hour. The San Francisco emergency services protocol calls for a basic adult dose of a 2 L bolus of normal saline followed by 500 ml/h, limited for \"pediatric patients and patients with history of cardiac or renal dysfunction.\"\n\nUse of a tourniquet can stall the life-threatening consequences of a crush related injury and can be a second option if the person cannot immediately have the fluids that were lost be medically replaced back into the body. Tourniquet measures should be taken if the person has been entrapped for more than 2 hours.\n\nThe clinician must protect the patient against hypotension, kidney failure, acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. Admission to an intensive care unit, preferably one experienced in trauma medicine, may be appropriate; even well-seeming patients need observation. Treat open wounds as surgically appropriate, with debridement, antibiotics and tetanus toxoid; apply ice to injured areas. Breathing and circulation must be checked out and the patient should be given oxygen if eligible. Oral or intravenous fluids must be given depending on the measured amounts of electrolytes, arterial blood gases, and muscle enzymes.\n\nIntravenous hydration of up to 1.5 L/hour should continue to prevent hypotension. A urinary output of at least 300 ml/hour should be maintained with IV fluids and mannitol, and hemodialysis considered if an increase in urine is not achieved. Use intravenous sodium bicarbonate to keep the urine pH at 6.5 or greater, to prevent myoglobin and uric acid deposition in kidneys.\n\nTo prevent hyperkalemia/hypocalcemia, consider the following adult doses:\n\nEven so, abnormal heart rhythms may develop; electrocardiographic monitoring is advised, and specific treatment begun promptly.\n\n"}

As originally built (1774-6) the barracks frontage was only half the present length, being the eastern half of the current south elevation, with the pediment and clock positioned centrally. Twenty-five years later, when further expansion was required, it was resolved to double the frontage by building an identical façade to the west, with a wind-dial in place of the clock. The architect James Wyatt then married the two halves together with a centerpiece triumphal arch.\n\nBehind the south frontage the barracks were laid out on a grid pattern, and included soldiers' accommodation, officers' quarters, the officers' mess, a chapel and a library with ancillary buildings further behind along with stores and stables for the horse artillery. Several of these buildings were altered over time or entirely replaced in a number of refurbishment programmes; Wyatt's officers' mess remains \"in situ\". In 1973 the barracks were designated as a Grade II* listed building.\n\nFor many years the 17.75-ton Bhurtpore gun, captured by Lord Combermere after the 1826 siege of Bhurtpore, stood outside the barracks. To the south, Barrack Field is a cricket ground which has been in use since the mid 18th century.\n\nOn 23 November 1981, the Provisional Irish Republican Army targeted Government House of the Royal Artillery on Woolwich New Road in a bomb attack which injured two people. In 1983 the barracks itself was targeted, again by the IRA, in a bombing that injured five soldiers.\n\nSince the nineteenth century, the appropriateness of Woolwich as a base for the Artillery had been questioned. Suggestions of a move came to nothing until a Defence Estates Review in 2003 proposed a move to Larkhill on Salisbury Plain (where the Royal School of Artillery has been based since 1915). After very nearly 300 years in Woolwich, the last Artillery regiment (the 16th) left the barracks in July 2007. Two stained glass windows from the regimental chapel – one by Christopher Whall, an Arts & Crafts artist – were moved to the Garrison Church of St Alban the Martyr at Larkhill, where they are displayed in lightboxes.\n\nThe place of the Artillery was taken by the public duties line infantry battalion and incremental companies of the Foot Guards (who moved in from Chelsea Barracks and Cavalry Barracks). Soon afterwards, the Second Battalion The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment was posted to Woolwich from Cyprus. Then in 2012, an artillery link was regained when the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery moved from the St John's Wood Barracks to new quarters and stables on the Woolwich site, bringing with them a complement of 120 or thereabouts horses, historic gun carriages and artillery pieces used in their displays.\n\nThe shooting events at the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were held at a temporary venue at the Barracks. The original plan to conduct the shooting at the National Shooting Centre at Bisley, Surrey, was changed after the International Olympic Committee expressed reservations about the number of sports proposed to be staged outside London.\n\nIn May 2013 drummer Lee Rigby was murdered by extremists just outside the Barracks in a terrorist attack.\n\nIn November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the site would close in 2028.\n\nWoolwich has extensive links with heavy weaponry. Besides the Royal Artillery Barracks it was the location of the Royal Arsenal complex, which was the British Government's principal armaments manufacturing facility for over 200 years (and the original home of the Royal Artillery). The Royal Military Academy which trained artillery officers and engineers from 1741 to 1939 also began in the Arsenal before moving (like the Artillery barracks) onto Woolwich Common in 1806. Rooms in the Arsenal freed by the Academy's move were used to house the Royal Artillery Museum, which itself moved to the Common in 1820, where it was housed in the newly-rebuilt Rotunda. (In 2001 the museum returned to the Arsenal site and was renamed Firepower; but in 2016 it closed, pending relocation to Larkhill.) \nIn 1780, shortly after the opening of the Barracks, the Royal Artillery Hospital was opened on a nearby site to the east - one of the first purpose-built military hospitals in England; it was later expanded, first in 1801 and then in 1816. In 1865, the ground-breaking Royal Herbert Hospital was opened at the southern end of the Common; the earlier hospital was then converted to serve as barracks for the Military Train (forerunners of the Royal Army Service Corps); the RASC remained associated with these barracks, later known as Connaught Barracks, until 1962, when the Corps was amalgamated and the site redeveloped). The eighteenth-century buildings survive as Connaught Mews, an apartment complex off Grand Depot Road. \n\nIn 1781 a Royal Artillery regimental garden was laid out to the east of the Barracks, north of the hospital. A small garden survived there for the next 180 years, but from 1804 most of the area was given over to artillery storage: four long low sheds were built on the site, flanking a central range of workshops and offices, with a pair of magazines alongside to the west. Known as the Grand Depot, it was built as headquarters for the Ordnance Field Train (a precursor to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps) which was disbanded in 1855. In 1856, a Royal Army Clothing Department factory was built on the site of the two magazines (and much of the remaining garden); twelve years later, the factory moved to Pimlico, whereupon its building became the main block of what came to be known as Grand Depot Barracks (which covered the old Grand Depot site and served as an extension of the adjacent RA Barracks). In the 1870s some of the old sheds were converted for use as stables for the officers' horses and a pair of buildings were erected nearby to serve as a riding school and a 'manège' (a swordsmanship arena) for Artillery officers. The surviving Grand Depot buildings (including the listed central block of 1805) were demolished in 1970.\n\nIn 1803 a barracks was built further to the east (south of Love Lane, west of Thomas Street), to designs by Wyatt, to serve as headquarters for the Royal Military Artificers (later renamed the Royal Sappers and Miners) who, like the Royal Artillery, were under the Board of Ordnance rather than the War Office. In 1856 the Sappers and Miners were amalgamated into the Royal Engineers and a new Corps headquarters was established in Chatham. Thereafter, their Woolwich barracks initially served as overflow accommodation for cadets of the Royal Military Academy, but were soon given over to the Royal Artillery and annexed to what was now the Grand Depot Barracks next door. A small detachment of Royal Engineers remained, however, to serve the needs of the Arsenal and the Garrison, and the barracks continued in the 20th century to be known as the Royal Engineer Barracks (they were also known as Lower Barracks). They too were listed and yet were demolished in 1970.\nWoolwich Common itself has long been used for military purposes. In 1802-4 four Acts of Parliament transferred ownership of the Common (which until then had been grazing land) to the military; (a 'gatehouse' on Repository Road, built to accommodate soldiers guarding the garrison, dates from this time). Thereafter it served as a proving ground for artillery: guns were regularly tested there until the establishment of the Artillery Gunnery School at Shoeburyness in 1859. It is still a designated military training area although troops are not so often seen nowadays. The western edge of the Common was the location of the Shrapnel Barracks, also used by the Royal Artillery.\n\nFrom 1802, the open ground to the west of the Common became a field training ground known as the Repository Grounds. The ground was laid out with trees, ditches, ponds, ravines, earthworks, and other structures in order to train troops in the movement of guns, ammunition and heavy equipment across difficult terrain; workshops and carriage stores were built at the same time to service the site. This specialist training facility had been instituted by Sir William Congreve in the 1770s; he first established it alongside the Royal Military Repository within the Arsenal, which gave the training ground its name. As of 2012 the Repository Grounds were still used for training as well as providing new accommodation and stables for the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery.\n\nA regimental school was opened nearby in 1808; the Royal Artillery School buildings (dating from the 1850s) can still be seen in Greenhill Terrace. The Royal Artillery Institution, which began as a scientific club for officers, first met in an observatory that stood nearby in 1838; in 1854 it moved into new purpose-built accommodation just to the east of the Royal Artillery Barracks. In 1941 the RA Institution was destroyed by enemy action; after the war it occupied the main block of the former Royal Military Academy (which had itself moved to Sandhurst); the rest of the Academy buildings became an extension of the Garrison.\nSt George's Garrison Church was built on the eastern edge of the Common in 1863 (replacing a chapel within the barracks, which was converted to serve as a theatre). Romanesque in style with Byzantine detailing, it was largely destroyed by a V1 flying bomb on 14 July 1944, but the ruins have been preserved as a memorial.\nWoolwich Dockyard was one of the principal Royal Dockyards during the Tudor and Stuart periods; it closed in 1869 as the Thames was by then too difficult to navigate for the naval vessels of the time, and most of the site then served as an overflow depot for the Arsenal's ordnance stores. The Royal Marines, who had provided a military presence in the Dockyard, were housed in their own barracks just to the south, in Frances Street. After closure of the dockyard (and the consequent departure of the Marines) these barracks were renamed Cambridge Infantry Barracks and they went on to house various regiments until (despite being listed) they were almost entirely demolished in 1972. The adjacent Royal Marine Infirmary was likewise renamed in 1869 as Red Barracks, Woolwich; it went on to serve as headquarters of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps until 1921. From 1885, the barracks also housed Artillery College (formed out of the Royal Artillery Institution) until its move to Shrivenham at the start of the Second World War; afterwards, the Royal Artillery Records Office was based there. Again, despite being listed in 1972, Red Barracks was demolished in 1975; the perimeter wall remains.\n\nOn the northwest corner of Frances Street and Hillreach, opposite the barracks security gate, is the Kings Arms pub, targeted by the IRA in November 1974 in a bombing which killed Royal Artillery Gunner Richard Dunne and another man, and injured 35 others.\n\n\n\n"}

In scientific terms, he discovered that polyU codes for polyphenylalanine and hence the coding unit for this amino acid is composed of a series of Us or, as we now know the genetic code is read in triplets, the codon for phenylalanine is UUU. This single experiment opened the way to the solution of the genetic code. It was for this and later work on the genetic code for which Nirenberg shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology.

{"id": "2217817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217817", "title": "Swifts Creek", "text": "Swifts Creek\n\nSwifts Creek is a town in the Tambo Valley of East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. The town is on the Great Alpine Road between Omeo and Ensay, east of the state capital Melbourne and above sea level. The area was originally settled by Europeans in the gold rushes of the mid-1800s. At the , Swifts Creek and the surrounding area had a population of 419, with a median age of 47.\n\nThe Aboriginal name for the site of Swifts Creek was \"Bun Jirrah Gingee Munjie\", which translates as 'big kangaroos go to that place'. True to this name, mobs of large eastern grey kangaroos still frequent the town, especially at night when they are often seen feeding by the roadside, and on the local football ground and primary school oval.\n\nThe town of Swifts Creek is located at the confluence of Swifts Creek and the Tambo River. The creek was reputedly named after an otherwise unknown gold prospector named Swift who worked the creek panning for alluvial gold in the 1850s. The townsite itself was originally known as \"Swifts Creek Junction\", as it was at the road junction alongside Swifts Creek. Swift's Creek Post Office opened on 1 January 1867 and closed in 1879. Swift's Creek Junction Post Office opened on 1 May 1874 and was renamed Swift's Creek in 1926.\n\nIn the 1870s \"McLarty's Junction Hotel\" was established, and a small town with stores, service facilities, and a butter factory slowly grew up around the site.\n\nThe butter factory was constructed in 1907 and eventually produced 50 tonnes per annum, with the majority being sent for sale in Melbourne. Due to unreliable seasons, the factory eventually closed down in 1946. The building is no longer in existence, however Factory Lane just past the creek at the northern end of town marks its former location.\n\nA flour mill was also planned, but was instead installed in the nearby town of Ensay in 1913. These factories were constructed as a result of local demand for flour, milk, butter and cream. The cost of transporting goods was high as wagons from the nearest large town of Bairnsdale took a week in good weather to travel the distance (now approximately an hour by car). Around this time, Ian Ezard built the Swifts Creek sawmill, which provided the stable economy the town needed to move on from its gold mining beginnings. In contrast, the surrounding towns of Cassilis and Tongio West collapsed, as the area lost its potential for gold mining.\n\nThe primary industries today are timber and farming of sheep and cattle. Run by Dormit Industries, the sawmill specialises in making wood pallets out of low grade local mountain ash timber. It uses an advanced system designed in France which aims at utilising the entire log, and thus making the process economical. Besides this, the major employers in town are now the local branch of the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) and the government primary and secondary schools. There are also a number of small retail outlets and services, including a hotel, general store, gallery, bookshop, cafe, bakery and post office.\n\nThe district is also increasing in popularity as a tourist destination. The town offers limited tourist accommodation, including flats associated with the hotel, a caravan park, and cottage style accommodation approximately five kilometres from town heading towards Cassilis.\n\nThe Great Alpine Gallery on the Great Alpine Road, Swifts Creek, was founded in 1998 as a non-profit community art-space operated entirely by volunteers. The Gallery is open five days a week, Thursdays to Mondays. Entry to the Gallery is free for all visitors, and everyone is welcome. The gallery promotes and sells arts and crafts by local artists, and has regular events such as the Great Alpine Arts Trail each May, workshops and open studios, as well as a regular exhibition and three special exhibitions per year.\n\nSwifts Creek P-12 School was formed from the merger of Swifts Creek Secondary College and Swifts Creek Primary School in 2010. The Tambo Campus is the Omeo region's only Secondary College, while the Flagstaff Campus is the town's Primary School. The town also has a separate Kindergarten. The school, in particular the Tambo Campus, caters to students from the surrounding towns of Ensay, Cassilis, Omeo, and Benambra, as well as Swifts Creek itself. Despite this the school is very small, with a total enrolment of around 130 students in 2011 making it amongst the smallest in the state.\n\nResidents who wish to undertake tertiary education must either do so via distance education, or move away from the town. Students who finish Year 12 at the school usually move to nearby Bairnsdale which has limited tertiary education facilities mainly in the TAFE sector, or to Melbourne to attend university. Swifts Creek itself offers very limited further education opportunities via a TAFE Outreach service.\nAmong illustrious alumni of Swift's P-12 school is the talented future AFLW star Josie Gallagher.\n\nThe town's sporting facilities include a recreation reserve consisting of a football/cricket oval, netball courts, four tennis courts, a lawn bowls green, changing rooms, and club rooms.\n\nThe town also has a half-Olympic-length six-lane outdoor swimming pool located beside the school, and publicly accessible squash courts located within the grounds of the P-12 school's Tambo Campus. Around two kilometres north of town is the privately owned Tambo Valley Racecourse, where an annual Country Racing Victoria sanctioned picnic horse racing carnival is held on Easter Sunday each year, including the \"Swifts Creek Cup\".\n\nThe town's public golf course, the Tambo Valley Golf Club, is located about thirteen kilometres north of town in the locality of Bindi.\n\nDespite its small population, Swifts Creek boasts a number of sporting clubs. The Swifts Creek \"Demons\" Australian Rules Football team has been in existence for over 100 years. They currently compete in the Omeo & District Football League (ODFL), and have won 25 premierships including several in recent years. The team wears a blue jumper with a red vee, the traditional strip of the Melbourne Football Club AFL team. The affiliated Swifts Creek Netball Club also has a long and successful history, and wears a blue top with red skirt. Both football and netball clubs also have junior teams.\n\nThe former Swifts Creek Tennis Club has competed in the \"Omeo District Tennis Association\" (ODTA) since the association's inception in 1955, and has won 28 premierships in that time, by far the most successful club in the competition. The lawn bowling club competes in local competition, the former cricket club takes part in regional competitions in irregular seasons, and the golf club is involved in regular tournaments.\n\nLocal schools also strongly support the development of youth sport, and regularly compete above their weight in interschool competition in swimming, athletics, and a wide variety of team sports.\n\nLocal legend holds that the diving blocks currently in use at the Swifts Creek Pool were those used in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. Considerable weight is added to this story by careful comparison between these blocks and historical photos from the Olympics, such as this distant photo of a race showing the blocks front on, and especially this close-up photo of block four at a similar angle to that shown here (both historical photos are from the National Library of Australia collection).\n\nIt can be seen from the photos that the blocks in Swifts Creek are identical in size and structure to those used at the Melbourne Olympics, and would only have had to be repainted to account for the different colouration and style of the block numbers. Furthermore, the legend states that one of the missing blocks was given to Australian swimming icon Dawn Fraser as a souvenir of her success at the Games (there were eight blocks for the Olympics, but only six survive in Swifts Creek now). However there has been an alternative local legend circulating how one diving block was stolen during the 1970s by some say a Bairnsdale boy by the name of Michael Weston accompanied by Daniel Redenbach and Tom Alvin during a local festival. Today the diving block is believed to be in Dunkeld buried by a local Dunkeld boy. Swifts Creek resident Tony Skelton is said to know the precise location of the Diving Block in Dunkeld. If this legend is correct, then Swifts Creek has an important piece of Australian sporting history in everyday use, but largely unknown to most of the population.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2217827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217827", "title": "North Luzon Expressway", "text": "North Luzon Expressway\n\nThe North Luzon Expressway (NLE or NLEx), formerly known as the North Diversion Road and Manila North Expressway (MNEX), is a 4 to 8-lane limited-access toll expressway that connects Metro Manila to the provinces of the Central Luzon region in the Philippines. It is a component of Expressway 1 (E1) of the Philippine expressway network, Circumferential Road 5 (C-5) and Radial Road 8 (R-8) of Manila's arterial road network. It was built in the 1960s.\n\nThe expressway begins in Quezon City at the Balintawak Interchange with EDSA as a continuation of Andres Bonifacio Avenue. It then passes through Caloocan and Valenzuela in Metro Manila, and the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga in Central Luzon. It currently ends at Mabalacat and merges with the MacArthur Highway, which continues northward into the rest of Central and Northern Luzon. The segment between Santa Rita Exit in Guiguinto and the Balintawak Interchange in Quezon City is a part of the new alignment of the N1 (AH26).\n\nThe expressway, including Andres Bonifacio Avenue, has total length of 88 kilometers. The expressway segment has a length of 84 kilometres.\n\nOriginally controlled by the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC), operation and maintenance of the NLEx was transferred in 2005 to NLEX Corporation, a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (a former subsidiary of the Lopez Group of Companies until 2008). A major upgrade and rehabilitation was completed in February 2005 with road now having similar qualities to a modern French tollway and other entities.\n\nThe North Luzon Tollway (NLT) or the NLEX mainline cuts northwards from Manila to the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga. The expressway parallels MacArthur Highway from Quezon City to Mabalacat in Pampanga. It has 8 lanes from Balintawak Interchange to Balagtas Interchange, 6 lanes from Balagtas Interchange to San Fernando Exit, and 4 lanes from San Fernando to Sta. Ines Exit. The expressways has bridges that cross seven rivers. Some portions of the expressway are lined with billboards, including its viaduct portion. Various high voltage overhead power lines, most notably the Hermosa–Duhat–Balintawak transmission line of National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) from Smart Connect Interchange to San Fernando Exit, utilize the significant portion of the expressway route as the densely populated areas hinder acquisition of dedicated right of way.\n\nThe expressway starts at Balintawak Interchange as a physical continuation of Bonifacio Avenue. A few meters after the cloverleaf is Quirino Highway, with a northbound left exit ascending into a flyover to the northeast. Past this exit, Reparo Road parallels the expressway from Novaliches Exit to Eternal Gardens Memorial Park. The road approaches the Balintawak toll plaza, widening to 17 lanes only serving northbound traffic. The offices of NLEX Corporation is located near the toll plaza. A new toll plaza, opened in 2017, is built between the northbound and southbound lanes, servicing Class 1 vehicles (cars, jeepneys and other light vehicles), \n\nThe expressway reverts to four lanes, continues northward, crossing Tullahan River through the Tullahan Bridge, intersects with General T. De Leon Street, and passes the Smart Connect Interchange. It then passes through industrial areas and businesses within Valenzuela. The expressway's East Service Road starts paralleling the expressway before Paso de Blas exit. The road continues on a straight route, with a Caltex service area located near the Dulalia overpass, until it enters Bulacan.\n\nIt crosses Meycauayan River and after a few meters is the Meycauayan Exit to serve its town proper. Another service road named St. Francis Service Road runs beside the expressway's southbound lanes. It passes through residential areas and institutions within the municipality, intersects with Lias Road, and continues on a straight alignment. On Marilao, there is a Petron service area and after it are the Marilao River crossing and Marilao exit. It enters Bocaue after Marilao Exit, where Ciudad de Victoria and the Philippine Arena lies to the east. The road turns eastward to serve Bocaue toll plaza, where the southbound lanes widens to 22 lanes with 4 from a parallel road making a grand total of 26 lanes, and on the middle of it is a newly built toll plaza and road. It turns westward, passes through Bocaue Exit, Santa Maria River, and Taal Bridge, and continues on a straight alignment until Balagtas Interchange. Before it are the Petron for southbound and Shell for northbound traffic. Past the Shell service area is the Tabang Spur Road and Balagtas Interchange which was opened on March 20, 2012. This is the former terminus of the original segment of the expressway from 1967 to 1976 before it is extended to Dau.\n\nThe expressway narrows to three lanes per direction past Tabang Spur Road. It continues on a straight route, traversing paddy fields on the outskirts of Guiguinto, Malolos, and Pulilan. AH26 leaves NLEX at Santa Rita Exit, where it follows Maharlika Highway, also known as \nCagayan Valley Road, to Baliuag and Cabanatuan.\n\nA few meters after Pulilan Exit is the Candaba Viaduct (officially known as Pulilan-Apalit Bridge). The bridge traverses rice paddies and swampland in the municipalities of Pulilan, Calumpit, Bulacan and Apalit, Pampanga, and crosses Pampanga River before the viaduct ends. The expressway continues again on a straight alignment, passing through Apalit, San Simon, Santo Tomas, and San Fernando, and crosses Abacan and San Fernando rivers. At the vicinity of San Fernando Exit are two major malls, SM City Pampanga and Robinsons Starmills Pampanga.\n\nAfter San Fernando Exit, the expressway narrows into two lanes, both northbound and southbound. It continues as a straight roadway, passing through the rural areas of Mexico, crossing Abacan and Quitangil rivers, and traversing the eastern parts of Angeles and Mabalacat. NLEX connects with Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway via Clark Spur Road before the main line terminates at Santa Ines Interchange, with a toll plaza serving the exit. The segment between SCTEX and Santa Ines Exit used to be a two-lane road but has since widened into four lanes with a grass median.\n\nTabang Spur Road branches off the NLEX mainline at Tabang Exit and terminates at a partial cloverleaf interchange with MacArthur Highway and Maharlika Highway (Cagayan Valley Road) at Guiguinto Exit. The entire spur is located in Guiguinto, and carried the final leg of NLEX (then the North Diversion Road) until the present route is extended to Angeles. It spurs off the main line at Tabang Exit, crosses the abandoned Philippine National Railways line to Cabanatuan, and ends at the interchange with MacArthur Highway and Maharlika Highway, with a toll plaza hosting operations and management offices of Tollways Management Corporation.\n\nSegment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link) is a four-lane, spur road that runs from Mindanao Avenue to the Smart Connect Interchange in Valenzuela City. It starts at the Smart Connect Interchange with the NLEX mainline, picking-up from where Segment 9 (Karuhatan Link) left off.\nOn the other hand, Segment 9 starts after Segment 10 crosses MacArthur Highway on Valenzuela. Segment 8.1 returns to ground level past the interchange. It would then pass Barangay Que Grande in Valenzuela, and terminates at the Mindanao Avenue toll plaza, where it physically ends at Mindanao Avenue near the city boundary with Quezon City.\n\nBoth Segments 8.1 and 9 are components of Circumferential Road 5 (C-5).\n\nNLEX Harbor Link, also named NLEX Segment 10, is a four-lane, fully elevated expressway which connects with the Karuhatan Link (Segment 9) at Valenzuela to C-3 Road in Caloocan, where it veers right for another and ends \nat Radial Road 10 in Navotas. It is designated to provide access between Port of Manila and northern Luzon. Most of the road utilizes the existing railway right of way through Caloocan, Malabon, and Valenzuela, with the road rising as high as to provide necessary clearance for the elevated Manila–Clark Railway of the Philippine National Railways (PNR).\n\nNLEX Harbor Link begins at Karuhatan Exit with Segment 9. The section near the northern terminus traverses an industrial and residential area, which necessitated the demolition of numerous houses, buildings, and warehouses. It soon follows the railway right-of-way where it rises up to provide necessary ground clearance for the viaduct carrying the future Manila–Clark Railway. Past Samson Road and the PNR rolling stock shops in Caloocan, NLEX Harbor Link shifts to the right of the railway right of way, which also required demolition of numerous houses and buildings, including a local wet market. The expressway ends at an interchange with C-3 Road, with completed stubs to connect with the C3–R10 spur alignment which is under construction, and the future NLEX-SLEX Connector Road.\n\nIts original stretch from Karuhatan to C-3 Road was first opened to traffic on February 28, 2019. Its C3–R10 Section was then partially opened on February 21, 2020 up to Malabon (Dagat-dagatan) exit ramp. It is expected to be completed on June 15, 2020.\n\nThe original stretch of the expressway, from Balintawak Interchange up to Guiguinto Exit in Bulacan, was completed on August 4, 1968. It is a fully fenced limited-access highway that consisted of a four-lane rural divided roadway, nine twin bridges, one railroad overpass, seven underpasses and three interchanges.\n\nOriginally a project of the Department of Public Works and Highways, the completion of the major portion of the job fell on the Construction Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP, the precursor to PNCC) to pioneer the toll concept of funding infrastructure. It was carried out under the private financing scheme provided by Republic Act 3741.\n\nAdditional work required by the government included the construction of the Balintawak – Novaliches Interchange Complex, the Tabang Interchange, and the approach road of the underpasses.\nIn 1976, the NLT extension, consisting of of concrete road, was built as part of a highways program of the International Bank for Reconstruction Development (World Bank) linking major urban centers to the production centers in the north. The project features a 4-lane limited-access highway with a five-kilometer Candaba Viaduct, a construction innovation utilizing precast beam system, 6 interchanges, 12 bridges, and overpass/underpass structures.\n\nIn 1989, under the Corazon Aquino administration, the expressway was extended by another 5 km from its terminus at Dau Exit to Sta. Ines Exit in Mabalacat, Pampanga.\nFrom 2003 to February 2005, the expressway underwent a major rehabilitation. Works included the widening of the Balintawak – Tabang segment from 6 to 8 lanes and the Tabang – Sta. Rita segment from 4 to 6 lanes, asphalt overlay, and the demolition of old tollbooths. The main contractor of the rehabilitation work was Leighton Contractors (Australia) with Egis Projects, a company belonging to the French Groupe Egis as the main subcontractor for the toll, telecommunication and traffic management systems. To help maintain the safety and quality of the expressway, various rules are in effect, such as restricting the left lane to passing vehicles only and banning overloaded trucks. \n\nAfter the rehabilitation, the operation and maintenance of the expressway was transferred from the state-owned Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) to the Manila North Tollways Corporation (now NLEX Corporation).\n\nOn June 5, 2010, the NLEx Segment 8.1 or the NLEX Mindanao Avenue Link was opened. The spur road is a part of the C-5 Road North Extension and is built to provide another entry point to the expressway from Metro Manila and decongest Balintawak Interchange.\n\nOn March 18, 2015, NLEX Segment 9 or the NLEX Karuhatan Link was opened, providing continuation to Segment 8.1 that runs from the other side of the Smart Connect Interchange to MacArthur Highway.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, the main stretch of NLEX Segment 10 or the NLEX Harbor Link, from NLEX Karuhatan Link to C-3 Road, was opened to traffic. On February 21, 2010, its C3–R10 section was partially opened up to its Malabon exit ramp, pending the completion of the spur section.\n\nThe NLEx Segment 8.2 will be a segment that will connect NLEx segment 8.1 to C-5 Road and Commonwealth Avenue. The planned segment will at first run parallel to Republic Avenue before making a southward turn to Luzon Avenue after which it will then connect to Commonwealth Avenue. The segment will include two interchanges in Mindanao and Regalado Avenues, a roundabout connection at Congressional Avenue, and three local road crossings at Quirino Highway, Sauyo Road, and Chestnut Avenue.\n\nPlans for a construction of an elevated road to connect North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) has been bared long before the construction of Segment 10.1.\n\nThe government has reportedly accepted an unsolicited proposal from Metro Pacific Tollways Development Corporation (MPTDC) to build the road. MPTDC is a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation (MPTC), which runs NLEX.\n\nKnown as the Connector Road project, the elevated expressway will have run over the Philippine National Railways tracks until terminating to the Skyway Stage 3 Interchange.\n\nIt will be connected in the north to the existing Segment 10 towards Valenzuela. In the south, it will be linked to the Skyway Stage 3 near PUP in Santa Mesa, Manila. Once completed, the Connector Road will have four entry and exit points: C-3 Road in Caloocan, España in Sampaloc, Manila, and terminating through the Paco-Sta. Mesa Road in Santa Mesa, Manila. This project is targeted open to traffic on February 2022.\n\nConstruction of the project is estimated to cost ₱17 billion, but as an \"all-elevated\" or completely grade-separated structure, right-of-way acquisition shall be reduced to an estimated cost of only ₱2.41 billion. It broke ground on February 28, at the same time Segment 10.1 was inaugurated and opened to traffic, officially indicating that the NLEX Karuhatan Link and Segment 10 are mostly complete.\n\nThis will be a extension with three segments from NLEX Main, originally in San Simon, Pampanga, to Dinalupihan, Bataan, connecting to Subic–Tipo Expressway (NLEx Segment 7). However, the plan did not push through. It would instead start somewhere between Apalit and San Fernando in Pampanga, then will cut across Guagua and end at Dinalupihan. Though the project will start tentatively from Apalit based on the concession, the new alignment has yet to be finalized.\n\n\nThe tollway has two sections: an open section and a closed section. The open section (within Metro Manila) charges a flat toll based on vehicle class and is employed to reduce the number of toll barriers (and associated bottlenecks) within the metropolis. The closed section is distance-based, charging based on the class of vehicle and distance traveled. When the expressway was modernized, an electronic toll collection system was set up for Class 1 vehicles while prepaid magnetic cards were assigned to Class 2 and 3 vehicles to speed up transactions at toll booths. These have since been replaced by a unified ETC system operated by Easytrip. Also, with the government's thrust towards toll road interoperability, Autosweep of the SMC Corporation which operates SLEX, Skyway, STAR, NAIAX, and TPLEX has been accepted as a mode of payment in NLEX since March 2018. As of October 1, 2011, all tolls (as shown below) include the 12% Value-Added Tax (VAT). With the movement of the northernmost toll gate to Sta. Ines, the NLEX and SCTEX toll systems have been merged into one combined system, with tolls for all enclosed destinations listed.\n\n\nThe NLEX has 8 lanes, 4 lanes in both directions from the Balintawak to Burol segment, 6 lanes with 3 lanes for both directions on the Burol to San Fernando segment and 4 lanes with 2 lanes for both directions on the Tabang Spur and San Fernando to Santa Ines segment. Before the lane expansion project of 2016, there was even a part of the NLEX which consists of only 2 lanes, one for each direction. This segment is located after passing through the SCTEx Exit (Northbound) but has since been expanded into four lanes.\n\n100 km/h for cars and jeepneys, 80 km/h for trucks and buses, and 60 km/h is the minimum for all classes of vehicles. Speed limits are strictly enforced via CCTV cameras and speed guns, and speeders are usually identified as soon as they hit the tollbooth.\n\nThe upgrade consisted of rebuilding of roads and building new toll plazas. Launched in the beginning of 2003 and completed in February 2005, the roadway now has modern features explained above.\n\nThe entire stretch of the expressway underwent another rehabilitation regarding its drainage systems. The expressway is known to be flooded during the rainy season and the goal of the project is to fix the drainage systems within the road to prevent flooding. Within this period, certain lanes of the road were closed to the traffic.

His research has assisted in modelling psychiatric conditions – depression, bipolar and personality disorders – and examining causes, mechanisms and treatments for mood disorders, together with innovative clinical work. Parker is a critic of the current unitary classification of major depressive disorder (as represented in the DSM-5), and has proposed the revival of the diagnosis of melancholia. In 2010 he was made an officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of his distinguished service to psychiatry as a clinician and researcher, particularly as a major contributor to the understanding and innovative treatment of mood disorders and as founder and Executive Director of the Black Dog Institute.\n\nParker was born in Melbourne, schooled at Shore in Sydney, completed an MB BS at the University of Sydney (USyd), and an MD (1978), PhD (1983) and DSc (1997) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). He is married, with four children. His path to Medicine and his clinical rationale is outlined in his autobiography, \"\"A Piece of My Mind\"\".\n\nParker was Head of the School of Psychiatry at the University of NSW from 1983-2002, as well as Director of the Division of Psychiatry at Prince of Wales and Prince Henry Hospitals in Sydney from 1983 to 1996. In 2002, he became the founder and inaugural Director of the Black Dog Institute, an organisation that focuses on research into and treatment of mood disorders, in particular clinical depression and bipolar disorder. \n\nAs a consequence of his advocacy for diagnosing melancholia, in 2010 Parker was invited to head a group of prominent international psychiatrists to argue for its separate status in the new DSM-5 classificatory system.\n\nParker has been a member of the Editorial Boards of 16 journals, and was the invited Editor of the December 2015 issue of \"Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica\". He is an invited assessor for various National Health and Medical Research (NHMRC) Grants as well as for scientific journals, for example, The Lancet and The American Journal of Psychiatry. He has been involved with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) – as Editor of the Journal (1979-88) and Chair of the Quality Assurance Committee (1990-95).\n\nParker has also held a number of positions with legal organisations, including the NSW Guardianship Board (1990-95) and the NSW Administrative Appeals Tribunal (1991-92). He has sought to make the community more aware of depressive sub-types (especially melancholia) and the bipolar conditions (especially bipolar II disorder) via multiple TV, radio and print interviews and personalised programs (for instance, two ABC \"Australian Story\" programs detailing nuances of bipolar II disorder).\n\nDuring his time at the Black Dog Institute, Parker ‘translated’ research findings via educational programs – some with health professionals in mind and some shaped for the general community. Parker has also developed or evaluated a number of assessment and self-assessment tools to help practitioners and individuals to gauge the type and clinical import of a mood disorder.\n\nIn 2004, Parker received a Citation Laureate from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) as the Australian Scientist most highly cited in the field of “Psychiatry/Psychology”. His citations exceed 35,000.\n\nIn 2008, Parker received a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission award for his book: “\"Journeys with the Black Dog\"”, and in 2010 his book “\"Tackling Depression at Work\"” was short-listed for a further Australian Human Rights Commission award.\n\nIn 2017, Parker was awarded the James Cook Medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales for \"Outstanding contributions to both science and human welfare in and for the Southern Hemisphere\".\n\nLifetime awards include the RANZCP Senior Psychiatric Research Award (twice), Australasian Society of Psychiatric Research Founders Award, NSW Forensic Psychology Award, UNSW Alumni Award for Science and Technology, Suicide Prevention Lifetime Research Award, and Officer of the Order of Australia in 2010.\n\nThe University of NSW awards \"Scientia Professor\" status for those academics who have demonstrated \"outstanding research performance.\" Parker was the first clinical academic to be awarded such status in 2000, for a five-year period, and subsequently for three further periods up until 2018.\n\nParker was a New South Wales finalist in the 2019 Australian of the Year Awards, in the category of Senior Australian of the Year.\n\nParker has published more than 900 papers, over 600 in peer-reviewed journals; 70 book chapters; and written or edited 18 books. \nA complete list is available at the UNSW Faculty of Medicine website, Professor Gordon Barraclough Parker publications:\n\nParker has worked as a creative writer – writing for \"The Mavis Bramston Show\", a cartoonist for \"Oz magazine\" and \"The Bulletin\", and a book reviewer for major Australian newspapers.

{"id": "2217846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217846", "title": "Nepali tea", "text": "Nepali tea\n\nNepali tea is a beverage made from the leaves of tea plants (\"Camellia sinensis\") grown in Nepal. They are distinctive in appearance, aroma and taste, but are similar in many ways to tea produced in Darjeeling tea, perhaps because the eastern zones of Nepal have geography and topography similar to Darjeeling. Its relatively smaller production quantities mean that teas from Nepal are less well known than those from Darjeeling.\n\nNepal's teas fall into two types of tea: Orthodox tea and Crush, tear, curl tea.\n\nOrthodox tea is – as Darjeeling Tea – made from the Chinese Variety of the tea plant (C. sinensis var. sinensis). The tea is hand- or machine-rolled. Most speciality teas like green tea, oolong tea, white tea and hand rolled tea fall under the category of orthodox tea. In Nepal, orthodox tea is produced and processed in the mountainous regions of Nepal at an altitude ranging from 3,000 to 7,000 feet above the sea level. There are six major districts, primarily in the eastern regions of Nepal that are known for producing quality orthodox tea, which are Ilam, Panchthar, Dhankuta, Terhathum, Sindhulpalchok and Kaski.\n\nOrthodox tea in Nepal is characterized by four flushes:- \n\nCrush, tear, curl (CTC) tea is a method of processing Assam variety \"(Camellia sinensis\" var. \"assamica)\", which grows in the lower-altitude, hot and humid plains of Nepal, primarily in Jhapa district. It accounts for almost 95% of the domestic consumption, owing to its lower cost of production compared with orthodox tea.\n\nThe Nepal CTC tea is also characterized by four pronounced flushes, the First, Second, Monsoon and Autumn flushes, but unlike the orthodox tea, the CTC tea is more or less uniform throughout, often exhibiting a strong color and subtle aroma after infusion. However, the flushes do not begin and end in accordance with that of the orthodox tea, mainly because of differences in local conditions.\n\nDuring the 1800s and the early 1900s, Nepal was under the reign of a highly centralized autocracy, the Rana Dynasty, which acted as a monarchy; their policies resulted in the isolation of Nepal from the external world. Nepal's borders and governance were constantly under turmoil, both internally and externally. Unlike India, the policies helped Nepal retain its national independence from the British colonial rule, but insulated it from modernization and economic development. Thus the nascent Nepali tea industry was adversely affected compared with the nearby Darjeeling tea industry, which thrived under the British colonial rule.\n\nIt is believed that the first tea bushes in Nepal were grown from seeds which were given as a gift by the Chinese Emperor to the then Prime Minister of Nepal, Jung Bahadur Rana. Nevertheless, Nepal's tea industry owes its roots to the colonization of India, by the world's first multinational company, the “East India Company”, under the British Empire. Around 1863, within a time span of 10 years after the first tea plantation was set up in Darjeeling, hybrids of tea bushes were brought, and the Nepal's first tea plantation, \"Ilam Tea Estate\" was set up in Ilam district, at an altitude of 4,500-5,000 feet above the sea level. Visioning better future prospects of the tea industry in Nepal, two years later a second tea plantation, \"Soktim Tea Estate\" was set up in the Jhapa district. Later into the 1900s the Nepalese tea producers acted as suppliers to Darjeeling factories when tea bushes became old and yields decreased.\n\nHowever, the nascent tea industry of Nepal failed to grow. At a time period when the Darjeeling tea industry was beginning to do very well in the global mercantilist market, the tea industry of Nepal failed to provide even for the domestic consumption. The reason for the setback of the Nepal's young tea industry was mainly due to political turmoil and resulting economic policies of that period, under the reign of the Rana Dynasty.\n\nDuring the 1950s, there was a shift in the political scenario of Nepal. A new constitution was written to develop a democratic system. Despite failure in successful democratization, Nepal's economy at least opened up to the rest of the world. As a result, the stagnant tea industry witnessed an inflow of public and private investment. The first private tea plantation was set up in 1959, in the terai region under the name Bhudhakaran Tea Estate.\n\nIn 1966, the Nepal Tea Development Corporation (NTDC) was set up to aid the development of the tea industry. Originally, tea leaves produced in Nepal were sold to factories in Darjeeling, as the Darjeeling tea bushes had become old, leading to the deterioration of the processed tea. The Nepalese tea leaves were therefore a valuable input for the factories in and around Darjeeling. Finally in 1978, the first factory in Nepal was set up in Ilam for the processing of tea leaves and a few years later another factory was set up in Soktim, Jhapa district. From 1978 to the 1990s, various efforts were made by the Nepal Tea Development Corporation with the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), to encourage the participation of small and marginal farmers in the growth and production of tea as a cash crop. As a result, today the small and marginal farmers constitute the majority percentage share in Nepal's tea industry. Slowly, the stagnant tea industry was evolving into a fully commercialized industry, benefitting the country's economic and socio-economic development. To further aid in the development of its tea industry, in 1982, His Majesty's Government of Nepal under the reign of the then King of Nepal Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, declared five districts – Jhapa, Ilam, Panchthar, Dhankuta and Terhathum as Tea Zones of Nepal. \n\nFrom 1987 to 1993, some of today's notable institutions were incorporated to further aid the Nepal Tea Development Corporation in the development of a century old stagnant tea industry, like – National Tea and Coffee Development Board (NTCDB), Nepal Tea Planters' Association (NTPA) and Himalayan Orthodox Tea Producers' Association (HOTPA). In 1997, Nepal's tea industry saw a major transformation towards privatization, with the privatization of the plantations and factories under the Nepal Tea Development Corporation (NTDC).\n\nSince the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, an array of international non-governmental organizations (like – Winrock, SNV, GTZ etc.) have become involved with the stakeholders of Nepal's tea industry, because the tea industry in Nepal also played a significant role in the eradication of poverty, especially in the rural areas where the tea plantations were concentrated. By the 21st century the stagnant tea industry had transformed into a fully commercialized industry, yet it had not yet developed a strong brand in the global market, lacking efficiently integrated production and marketing systems.\n\nHence, in 2000 as per the provisions of the National Tea and Coffee Development Board Act of 1992, the Government of Nepal ratified the National Tea Policy. The National Tea Policy focussed on the following five main broad topics: -\n\nToday, Nepal's tea industry is dominated by private interests with the first private orthodox factory, Bhudkharan tea private limited being established in 1960, whereas in the 1980s the tea industry was a Government monopoly prior to the liberalization of the tea industry. Until 2000, Nepal's tea exports accounted for only about 100 – 150 tons per annum. However, due to the liberalization adopted about a decade ago, Nepal's tea industry witnessed an exponential rise in tea exports, accounting for almost 4,000 – 5,000 tons per annum.\n\nAt present, Nepal produces approximately 16.29 million kilograms of tea per annum on an area of 16,718 hectares. It accounts for only 0.4% of the total world tea output. Tea is taken as self-dependent cash crop in agroforestry practice and is found as the most important example of the long term sustainable farming. The main tea producing regions in Nepal are Jhapa, Ilam, Panchthar, Dhankuta, Terhathum with newly involved regions being Kaski, Dolakha, Kavre, Sindhupalchok, Bhojpur, Solukhumbu and Nuwakot, with a goal of increasing the total tea production in Nepal. Nepal's teas are mainly exported to India, Pakistan, Australia, Germany, France, Poland the Netherlands, Japan, Belgium and the United States of America.\n\nHimalayan Orthodox Tea Producers Association (HOTPA), the association of orthodox tea producers of Nepal, realizing the potential of the Nepalese orthodox tea in the global market, has been adopting various measures to improve the quality and marketing of orthodox tea. In 2003, Himalayan Tea Producers Co-operative Limited (HIMCOOP), the marketing wing of the Himalayan Orthodox Tea Producers Association (HOTPA), was set up to assist in the marketing of Nepali tea. Similarly, in 2006, the Himalayan Orthodox Tea Producers Association (HOTPA) implemented the Code of Conduct. The main objective of the Code of Conduct was to increase the standards of Nepalese orthodox tea to an international level. The main principles of the Code of Conduct are:- \n\nFarmers are now supported by the National Tea and Coffee Development Board created by the Nepalese Ministry of Agriculture. A national tea policy was introduced by the NTCDB in 2000 which aimed to create more access to credit and land for farmers producing tea. Orthodox tea now provides a source of sustainability for almost 20 000 farmers in Nepal.\n\nCultivated in hilly areas and in high altitudes is conducive for the highest quality tea. In Nepal, the Eastern mountainous regions host most of the orthodox (as opposed to crush, tear and curl) tea crops at altitudes approximating 3000–7000 feet above sea level. Nepal has six districts in which Orthodox tea is produced; Ilam, Dhankuta, Kaski, Terhathum, Sindhulpalchok, and Panchthar. Among these districts there are a small number of medium-to-large scale tea estates as well as a large number of small holder farmers. Once the tea plant reaches maturity, its leaves can be harvested around four to five times a year, for many years. The different harvests of tea are called flushes. In Nepal there are four separate flushes in a growing season; first flush, second flush, monsoon flush, and autumn flush.\n\nThere is no Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) for pesticide in place. However, in the last decade numerous poisonous chemicals such as monocrotophos, quinalphos, ethion, and phorate have been prohibited (as of May 2005).\n\nAn Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is becoming more popular as an alternative to pesticide application. The IPM approach includes the use of bio fertilizers, vermin-compost, and organic farming. The lack of internal regulation of pesticide use adversely affects the commodity in terms of trade potential.\n\nThe United States Department of International Development recommended increasing the productivity of tea cultivation in Nepal by updating the out of date machinery that most processing factories currently use. Other interventions proposed include the introduction of motorized pruning devices to reduce labour and increase productivity with respect to time. A more recent obstacle that is limiting small farmers is the issue of pesticide use and achieving organic certification. The belief in Nepal is that becoming a certified organic farmer, a costly and time-consuming process, will yield significant increases in profit However, with organic tea production, yields decrease and labour increases significantly during initial stages of adaptation. In the end, the major problem for most tea farmers in Nepal is that they occupy the primary or secondary industry. Small tea farmers do not have the means to add value to their tea through processing and packaging; they rely on outside agents to purchase their bulk leaves.\n\nThe transition from subsistence farming to cash crop farming of orthodox tea provides a benefit to hillside farmers in terms of financial support and involvement in the domestic market. Many traditional farmers have given up subsistence farming and now specialize in solely growing tea. The profits that come from selling tea can then be used to purchase staple foods in a domestic market. The switch from traditional farming to cash cropping has reduced poverty rates among small holder farmers in tea growing. 70% of orthodox tea produced in Nepal in 2006 was by small farms. Orthodox tea is a profitable crop that is unique to hillside farmers. Forecasts by the NTCDB predict that by 2022 orthodox tea exports will reach 27 million kg, compared to the 2012 figure of 3 million kg. The paired growth in the tea sector will employ approximately 100 000 people. Engagement in overseas markets will allow Nepali tea producers to capitalize on their product's high quality and value as a niche product. Nepali orthodox tea is being sold well below premium to bordering countries such as India. A metric ton of Nepali green tea is valued at $1,180 in India, but $12,000 in the USA. Thus, in order for Nepali farmers and producers of orthodox tea to make the most money from this crop there is a need to export to countries like the USA who pay premium prices for the product.\n\n"}

{"id": "2217865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217865", "title": "Titus Groan", "text": "Titus Groan\n\nTitus Groan is a novel by Mervyn Peake. It is the first novel in the \"Gormenghast\" series.\n\nThe book is set in the huge castle of Gormenghast, a vast landscape of crumbling towers and ivy-filled quadrangles that has for centuries been the hereditary residence of the Groan family and with them a legion of servants. The Groan family is headed by Lord Sepulchrave, the seventy-sixth Earl of Groan. He is a melancholy man who feels shackled by his duties as Earl, although he never questions them. His only escape is reading in his library. His wife is the Countess Gertrude. Large and imposing, with dark red hair, she pays no attention to her family or to the rest of Gormenghast. Instead, she spends her time either in her bedroom or in walking selected areas, in the company of a legion of birds and her white cats that alone command her affections. Their daughter is 15-year-old Fuchsia Groan. Self-absorbed, childish and thoughtless, she is also impulsive, imaginative and at times fiercely affectionate. Sequestered in the south wing of the castle are Sepulchrave's identical twin sisters Cora and Clarice Groan. Both suffered from epileptic fits in their youth, as a result of which their left arms and legs are \"rather starved\". They have the same vague and vacant personalities, lacking intelligence to the point of mental impairment. Both crave political power and bitterly resent Gertrude, believing that she robbed them of their rightful place in the hierarchy of Gormenghast and of any involvement in its affairs. Also important to the life of the castle is Lord Sepulchrave's personal servant, Mr. Flay, who believes in strictly holding to the rules of Gormenghast.\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, two agents of change are introduced into the stagnant society of Gormenghast.\n\nThe first catalyst is the birth of Titus Groan, the heir to Lord Sepulchrave, which interrupts the centuries-old daily rituals which are practiced at all levels of the castle's society, from the kitchens to the Hall of Bright Carvings in Gormenghast's upper reaches. Though he is the title character and integral to the plot, Titus appears only infrequently as an infant during his first two years of life.\n\nThe second is Steerpike, a ruthlessly ambitious kitchen boy, whose rise drives the plot of \"Titus Groan\". His escape from the kitchen during the castle celebration of Lord Titus' birth introduces change into the stultified Gormenghast society. Steerpike is Machiavellian in his rise, but he can also appear charming and sometimes even noble.\n\nThe novel begins as the imperious and ritual-driven servant Mr. Flay seeks to tell someone new of the birth of an heir to the House of Groan in a remote part of the sprawling castle of Gormenghast. A son is born to Lord Sepulchrave, Earl of Groan and monarchical ruler of Gormenghast, and his wife, Countess Gertrude. He is named Titus and entrusted to Nannie Slagg by his indifferent mother. Nannie Slagg is an elderly, somewhat senile woman who serves as the nurse and mother figure for the Groan children. She is often unsure of herself, but relishes the small bit of power that comes with raising the heir to the house of Groan. Her first duty is to go to the dwellings of the Bright Carvers just outside the walls of Gormenghast to choose a wet nurse for Titus. Keda, the widow of a well-respected Carver who has recently lost a child from her late husband, volunteers to take on the role. Keda comes to live in the castle for a time helping to raise Titus. Later, she leaves the castle walls and is impregnated by one of her previous two suitors. The suitors promptly kill each other in a duel for her hand in marriage.\n\nOn the same day as Titus' birth, an ambitious kitchen boy of seventeen by the name of Steerpike escapes from the kitchens and the grossly fat, sadistic chef, Abiatha Swelter. Lord Sepulchrave's chief servant, Mr. Flay (Swelter's archenemy), comes upon Steerpike who has become lost in the confines of the castle, and takes him through the castle (large parts of which are uninhabited) to a room outside the quarters of the Earl and the Countess. Here, Steerpike takes the opportunity to spy on the Groan family.\nDespite having led him there, the fiercely loyal Flay is angered by Steerpike's eavesdropping and locks him in a small room. Steerpike, however, escapes out of a window, risking his life above a sheer drop. He manages to climb up onto the roofs and towers of Gormenghast, and from there begins his rise to power.\n\nAfter spending twenty-four hours clambering over the enormous castle searching for a means to enter, Steerpike manages to climb in through a window into the secret attic of Lady Fuchsia Groan. Fuchsia, who has a great affinity to the large area of long-abandoned attic space she has had all to herself, is at first appalled and outraged by his entry. He senses the importance of her naivety and seizes her attention by putting on an elaborate performance. She is the first of the royal characters on whom Steerpike will use his cunning to exploit.\n\nA while later, Steerpike accompanies Fuchsia to the house of Dr. Prunesquallor, and becomes his apprentice for a while. Dr. Alfred Prunesquallor is the castle's resident physician. He is an eccentric individual with a high-pitched laugh and a grandiose wit which he uses on the castle's less intelligent inhabitants. Despite his acid tongue, he is an extremely kind and caring man who also is greatly fond of Fuchsia and Titus. (In a few places in the text, Dr. Prunesquallor is given the first name of Bernard, but this was an error by Peake.) He lives with his sister Irma Prunesquallor. Though she is anything but pretty, she is considerably vain. She desperately desires to be admired and loved by men. In this position, Steerpike is able to come into even closer contact with members of the Groan family, in particular Lord Sepulchrave's twin sisters, Cora and Clarice Groan. The sisters are not very bright and are power-hungry and resentful, believing that Countess Gertrude holds the position that they rightfully deserve.\n\nSteerpike manages to use the twins' ambition for his own ends. He promises them power and influence, and convinces them that they could achieve their goal by burning down Sepulchrave's beloved library. Steerpike prepares meticulously for the act of arson. He arranges for the burning to happen when the entire Groan family and their most important servants are inside the library for a family gathering (Steerpike intentionally failed to tell the twins that they were invited as well, strengthening their feeling of bitterness towards Sepulchrave and Gertrude). He intends to lock the doors to prevent an escape, and then come through the window and save everyone inside from the fire, appearing as a hero and possibly strengthening his position and granting him more power in the castle.\n\nEverything goes according to plan: the entire Groan family (including the Earl and his heir) and most of the retainers are saved. Sourdust, the old Master of Ceremonies, dies of smoke asphyxiation and all the books in the library are destroyed in the flames. This comes as a great blow to Sepulchrave, a rather melancholic man, to whom the library was the only joy in his otherwise monotonous life, dominated by the ritualistic duties he must perform every day, every week, every month and every year at appropriate times.\n\nSteerpike hoped to become Master of Ritual (a very prestigious job in Gormenghast) after Sourdust died, but the title, like so many things in the castle, is hereditary, and so goes to Sourdust's seventy-four-year-old son Barquentine, who has lived almost completely forgotten in a remote part of the castle for sixty years. He is lame in his one leg, hideous, and unbelievably dirty. Barquentine is a consummate misanthrope who only cares for the laws and traditions of Gormenghast.\n\nDuring the weeks following the burning, Lord Sepulchrave becomes increasingly insane, starting to believe that he is one of the Death Owls living in the Tower of Flints (the tallest tower in the castle).\n\nFlay learns that Swelter intends to kill him. Flay had hit him across the face with a chain before Titus’ christening, escalating a mutual loathing into plans for vengeful murder. Flay observes Swelter practising the blow with a large cleaver, and so prepares himself for an attack, acquiring a sword for his protection, in case Swelter should ever attempt to murder him while he is sleeping in front of his master's door.\n\nThings happen differently though: Steerpike, now a full-time retainer of the twins, having quit Doctor Prunesquallor's service, angers Flay by sarcastically imitating Sepulchrave's madness. Flay loses control and hurls one of the countess’ white cats at Steerpike. At that moment, the Countess enters the room, and seeing that one of her beloved cats has been abused, immediately banishes Flay from Gormenghast.\n\nFlay is forced to learn how to survive outside the castle, and he sets up various homes in the nearby forest and on Gormenghast Mountain. Having a strong attachment to the castle, and feeling a need to watch over Steerpike and to protect Titus, Flay returns secretly to Gormenghast during the night. Four nights after Titus’ first birthday, Flay finds Swelter wandering the castle with a meat cleaver. Swelter does not know of Flay's banishment, and expects him to be sleeping where he has always slept up until now. Flay follows him to just outside Sepulchrave's door, where Swelter discovers that Flay is not there, and soon realizes that he has been followed. Flay lures Swelter to the Hall of Spiders (making use of the fact that Sepulchrave — who is by now quite insane — is sleepwalking), and there they fight a long duel. Eventually, Flay kills Swelter. Lord Sepulchrave arrives on the scene, and decides that Swelter's body should be taken to the Tower of Flints. After helping Sepulchrave carry the body to the tower, Flay is ordered to stay where he is. The mad Earl babbles about possible reincarnation, bids Flay farewell, and then drags the body into the tower by himself and is attacked and eaten by the starved Death Owls, along with Swelter's remains.\n\nAfter the disappearance of the Earl and the chief cook (the exiled Flay is not able to tell anyone what has happened), Steerpike leads a search for them. Naturally, their remains are not found, but Steerpike is able to gain a good knowledge of all the rooms in the castle.\nFlay lives in the mountains, making two caves and a shed for himself - living in seclusion but adept as a naturalist. He later witnesses Keda's suicide as she throws herself off a ledge. Initially just one of a number of minor background characters Keda's story shows some of the world outside the castle and her choices, journey and resolution are among the most emotive parts of the story.\n\nNine days after Sepulchrave's disappearance, Steerpike has a conversation with Barquentine. The Master of Ceremonies tells Steerpike that Titus is now to become Earl of Groan, despite the fact that he is only one year old. He also gives Steerpike the position of his assistant and heir to his post, since Barquentine does not have a child. As the apprentice to the Master of Ceremonies, Steerpike has a good, stable position in the castle, and can now study its inner workings.\n\nSteerpike fears that Cora and Clarice are too careless and may tell others that he convinced them to burn down Sepulchrave's library. Steerpike dresses as a ghost and convinces the twins they will die if they ever speak of the fire. By this stage, Steerpike has considerable influence in the affairs of Gormenghast, even if he is not yet a recognised figure of authority. He still has to influence people to do his work for him. Despite this, both the Countess and Dr. Prunesquallor are disturbed and uneasy about all that has happened, and disturbed about Steerpike's sudden rise. Yet neither is able to connect Steerpike as the cause of the tragic events, as he was their apparent saviour from the fire in the library.\n\nSoon afterwards, the “Earling” takes place, and young Titus is officially made Earl of Gormenghast. In a ridiculously elaborate ceremony on a nearby lake, little Titus holds aloft the sacred symbols of his status – the stone and ivy branch, and to the horror of observers, promptly drops them both into the lake. The scene is silent except for the shout of Titus and for the shout of Keda's unnamed baby, with a surrogate parent across the lake with the Bright Carvers.\n\nRottcodd: The curator of the Hall of Bright Carvings and the first character introduced in the series. Rottcodd lives the life of a recluse in the castle, rarely speaking to anyone and, when not dusting the statues at exactly seven o'clock, is usually sleeping in his hammock by the windowside. Flay feels the need to tell someone of the birth of Titus, and chooses Rottcodd, who is so cut off from the life of the castle that he is the only person left who has not heard the news. The book also ends with Rottcodd as he looks out the window at the entire population of the castle returning from Titus' Earling. Everyone had been invited except for him, as he had been forgotten.\n\nPentecost: Pentecost was one of the Outer Dwellers once, but worked himself up to become the head gardener of the palace.\n\nThe Poet: Known only by his professional name, the Poet holds a relatively important function of ritual in the castle. He is described as having a wedge-shaped head and a voice \"as strange and deep as a lugubrious ocean\". He is said to be the only person who can hold Lord Sepulchrave's interest in conversation. Steerpike comes across him on his journey across the rooftops, reciting a poem to himself out of his window. Upon realising that he has been overheard, the Poet wildly over-reacts, and tries to block up his window.\n\nRantel and Braigon: Keda's lovers, whose rivalry eventually leads to their death in a nighttime duel.\n\nBright Carvers or Mud Dwellers: Hereditary population of the extensive Mud Village situated up against and outside the walls of Gormenghast Castle, who are famed for their skill in woodcarving.\n\nSpringers, Spurter and Wrattle: Kitchen boys. Three of Swelter's helpers in the preparation of the Ceremonial Breakfast for Titus.\n\nWrenpatch and Flycrake: Kitchen boys. Swelter relishes the prospect of punishing them for arguing with each other, violating Swelter's strict orders for silence.\n\nGrey Scrubbers: Hereditary cleaners of the Great Kitchen.\n\nOld Man: Hermit, only known as \"Old Man\". He cares for Keda as she recovers from the rigours of her travels in the wilds.\n\nSmelly Old Woman: The Ladies Clarice and Cora's only servant. Used by Steerpike as an example of just how low the status of the Ladies Clarice and Cora has fallen as he draws them into his power.\n\nPellet: Servant in the Prunesquallors' household. He is replaced by Steerpike at the instigation of Irma Prunesquallor.\n\nShrattle: Armourer. Holds the only key to Groan armoury.\n\nIn 1984, BBC Radio 4 broadcast two 90-minute plays based on \"Titus Groan\" and \"Gormenghast\", adapted by Brian Sibley and starring Sting as Steerpike and Freddie Jones as the Artist (narrator). A slightly abridged compilation of the two, running to 160 minutes, and entitled \"Titus Groan of Gormenghast\", was broadcast on Christmas Day, 1992. BBC 7 repeated the original versions on 21 and 28 September 2003.\n\nIn 2000, the BBC and the PBS station WGBH of Boston produced a miniseries for television, titled \"Gormenghast\", based on the first two books of the trilogy.\n\nIn 2011, Brian Sibley adapted the story again, this time as six one-hour episodes broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as the Classic Serial starting on 10 July 2011. The serial was titled \"The History of Titus Groan\" and adapted the novels written by Mervyn Peake and the concluding volume, \"Titus Awakes\" written by his widow, Maeve Gilmore. It starred Luke Treadaway as Titus, David Warner as the Artist and Carl Prekopp as Steerpike. It also starred Paul Rhys, Miranda Richardson, James Fleet, Tamsin Greig, Fenella Woolgar, Adrian Scarborough and Mark Benton among others.\n\nThere have been stage adaptations of \"Titus Groan\", the most recent of which was by theatre company Blackshaw and debuted at the Actors' Church in London's Covent Garden in April 2012.\n"}

It is made up of 26 dioceses and archdioceses plus an apostolic vicariate.\n\nIn 1996, there were approximately 3.3 million Catholics in South Africa, making up 6% of the total South African population. Currently, there are 3.8 million Catholics. 2.7 million are of various black African ethnic groups, such as Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho. Coloured and white South Africans each account for roughly 300,000. \n\nRoman Catholic evangelization efforts have traditionally focused on Black South Africans. In the 1950s, however, an effort began to evangelize Afrikaans-speakers, who had previously been ignored by Catholic missionaries. Success in the Afrikaans Apostolate remained minimal until the death throes of Apartheid during the mid to late 1980s. As Catholic texts began to be translated into Afrikaans, sympathetic Dutch Reformed pastors, who were defying the traditional anti-Catholicism of their Church, assisted in correcting linguistic errors. By 1996, the majority of Afrikaans-speaking Catholics came from the Coloured community, with a smaller number of Afrikaner converts, most of whom were from professional backgrounds.\n\nMost White South African Catholics are English speakers, and the majority are descended from Irish immigrants. Many others are Portuguese South Africans, many of whom emigrated from Angola and Mozambique after they became independent and disintegrated into civil war during the 1970s and then majority of South Africa's Italian population. The proportion of Catholics among the predominantly Calvinist white Afrikaans speakers, or Asian South Africans who are mainly Hindus or Protestant of Indian descent, is extremely small.\n\nThe Catholic Church in South Africa consists of five Archdioceses (Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesberg, and Pretoria), 22 Dioceses, 2 Vicariates Apostolic and a Military Ordinariate.

He was appointed bishop at the age of 31 and was a leader in opposing the apartheid regime. Like him, many senior officials within the Catholic Church in South Africa opposed apartheid, but a group of conservative white Catholics formed the South African Catholic Defence League to condemn the church's political involvement and, in particular, to denounce school integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

St Patrick's is the only school in Queensland that offers education to Years 11 and 12 only. The college's motto is \"Seek Christ\", which reflects one of the College's main aims, to develop the person spiritually. The current principal is Janelle Agius.\n\nSt Patrick's College was founded in 1929 as St Patrick's Christian Brothers College, an all-boys school run by the Congregation of Christian Brothers. The school was situated on the Gregory Street site which is the main campus of the current school. From the 1870s, the River Street site of today's St Patrick's College was occupied by St Joseph's Convent School (later St Patrick's Convent School). On the closure of the convent primary school, the Christian Brothers' College obtained the use of the River Street land. On the River Street side was CBC's primary school and on the Gregory Street side was CBC's secondary school. In 1987 St Patrick's became what it is today. Our Lady of Mercy College (an all-girls school) became Mercy College, a co-educational school for junior high school (Years 7-10) and St Patrick's became a co-educational school for Years 11 and 12 only.\n\nThere is a wide selection of cultural activities available within the college. Many students exhibit talent in public speaking, drama, music and the visual arts. St Patrick's College provides students with opportunities to further their creative skills, and encourages participation in cultural activities both in the college and the wider Mackay community.\n\nThe college participates in interschool debating and encourages students to enter competitions such as Lion's Youth of the Year, Youth Speaks for Australia, Rostrum Public Speaking and so on. The college has established an enviable record in the areas of dramatic performance, debating and public speaking, with St Patrick's being State Champions of Queensland in the Apex Debating Competition in 2005 and 2006, and National Champions in 2004. Debating is arguably the school's most successful extracurricular, non-sporting activity.\n\nSt Patrick's College provides opportunities for students to develop their musical talents and provides opportunities for performance. Musical tuition is available through the college in brass, woodwind and percussion, and Music is available as a subject to study. Students have the opportunity to play in the stage band and concert bands which are combined bands with Mercy College Mackay. The St Patrick’s choir has attained a high reputation in the community and the handbell ensemble (being one of the largest in the southern-hemisphere) is a unique and challenging musical experience for students. In 2006, the handbell ensemble attended the World Handbell Symposium in Brisbane and were delighted to receive the top mark in Youth strand for their performance. In 2009 co-curricular arts students travelled to New Zealand for the Rhapsody Rotorua music festival and the 25th Australasian Handbell Symposium.\n\nSt Patrick's is well-renowned in the community for its high-quality bi-annual theatre productions, which have included adaptations of The Wizard of Oz, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, West Side Story (2006), Godspell (2008) and All Shook Up (2010). In 2012 the college presented an adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webbers' Cats, becoming one of the first schools in Australia to perform the production.\n\nThe college also hosts a cultural dinner and cultural soiree to showcase and acknowledge students’ talents and achievements. The lunchtime comedy theatre is one of the year’s attractions. St Pats regularly produces musicals or theatre restaurants, and participates in the Mackay Festival of the Arts.\n\nAt St Patrick's College, all students \"must\" study a religion subject, and the college views those subjects as having the same status and importance as all other subjects in the college. Students have a choice to study either:\n\nBoth subjects are approved by the Queensland Studies Authority (QSA) and results from both subjects will appear on students’ senior certificates. Results from Study of Religion can contribute towards students’ O.Ps. Results from Religion & Ethics, however, do not contribute towards a student's O.P score.\n\nAs St Patrick's College is a Catholic school, the College participates in various liturgies, masses and other Catholic events. While it is not a requirement to be Catholic to be enrolled at the College, all students are expected to be respectful and reverent during times of prayer within the College.\n\nSt Patrick's students are encouraged to participate in the many sports offered within the college. They can choose to study the subjects Physical Education or Recreation Pursuits in Years 11 and 12, which cover the theoretical and practical sides of sport. Physical Education contributes towards a students O.P score, but Recreation Pursuits does not.\n\nAn aquatics carnival, athletics carnival, triathlon, and a cross-country involve students in inter-house competition. The College sees these carnivals as an important part of school life and attendance is compulsory. In addition, there are inter-school carnivals and trials days in the following sports: athletics, Australian rules football, basketball, cricket/indoor cricket, cross country running, football, Futsal, hockey, netball, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, swimming, tennis, touch football, waterpolo, and volleyball.\n\nSt Patrick's is well represented each year in various sports at the highest level possible for school sport. St Patrick’s reputation for sporting excellence has been hard won and provides a source of pride not only for immediate members of the college community but the wider community as well.\n\nThe houses at St Patrick's College are all named after significant members of the Catholic Church. Rice is named after the founder of the Christian Brothers, McAuley is named after the founder of the Sisters of Mercy, Colin is named after the founder of the Marists (Society of Mary), and Chisholm is named after an Australian pioneer who helped numerous poor women on the wharves of Sydney. As of 2004, the houses have been separated along gender and year level lines, for example, in 2004 Rice house was year 12 boys.\n\nThe houses are:\nNamed after Edmund Ignatius Rice, the founder of the Christian Brothers.\nNamed after Catherine McAuley, a Catholic nun who founded the Sisters of Mercy.\nNamed after Jean-Claude Colin, founder of the Society of Mary (Marists). \nNamed after Caroline Chisholm, social reformer and pioneer in Sydney.\n\n\n"}

This type of LCD was invented at the Brown Boveri Research Center, Baden, Switzerland, in 1983. For years a better scheme for multiplexing was sought. Standard twisted nematic (TN) LCDs with a 90 degrees twisted structure of the molecules have a contrast vs. voltage characteristic unfavorable for passive-matrix addressing as there is no distinct threshold voltage. STN displays, with the molecules twisted from 180 to 270 degrees, have superior characteristics. The main advantage of STN LCDs is their more pronounced electro-optical threshold allowing for passive-matrix addressing with many more lines and columns. For the first time, a prototype STN matrix display with 540x270 pixels was made by Brown Boveri (today ABB) in 1984, which was considered a breakthrough for the industry.\n\nSTN LCDs require less power and are less expensive to manufacture than TFT LCDs, another popular type of LCD that has largely superseded STN for mainstream laptops. STN displays typically suffer from lower image quality and slower response time than TFT displays. However, STN LCDs can be made purely reflective for viewing under direct sunlight. STN displays are used in some inexpensive mobile phones and informational screens of some digital products. In early 1990s, they had been used in some portable computers such as Amstrad's PPC512 and PPC640.\nCSTN stands for color super-twist nematic, a color form of passive matrix LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) for electronic display screens originally developed by Sharp Electronics. The CSTN uses red, green and blue filters to display color. The original CSTN displays developed in the early 1990s suffered from slow response times and ghosting (where text or graphic changes are blurred because the pixels cannot turn off and on fast enough). Recent advances in the technology, however, have made CSTN a viable alternative to active matrix displays. New CSTN displays offer 100ms response times (for comparison TFT displays offer 8ms or less), a 140 degree viewing angle and high-quality color rivaling TFT displays – all at about half the cost. A newer passive-matrix technology called High-Performance Addressing (HPA) offers even better response times and contrast than CSTN.\n\n\n"}

Null and drummer Tatsuya Yoshida. Formed in Tokyo in 1987, the group's name translates roughly as \"money violence\" (\"Zeni\" is an old Japanese term for money, and \"Geva\" comes from the German \"Gewalt,\" meaning \"violence\").\n\nZeni Geva's music can be diverse and experimental, incorporating elements ranging from death metal and hardcore punk to math rock, psychedelic, and noise rock. Their music is often technically unorthodox and demanding, and has earned progressive rock comparisons: critic Patrick Kennedy describes their 1993 album \"Desire for Agony\" as resembling \"Motörhead meets King Crimson.\"\n\nThe Chicago-based Skin Graft Records has released much of the band's music in North America, and the band released several albums with the American Alternative Tentacles label.\n\nFollowing several years in the Japanese noise rock scene that included collaborations with Merzbow and Hanatarashi, experimental noise rock guitarist and electronic programmer KK Null formed Zeni Geva in 1987 with guitarist Fumiyoshi Suzuki (also known as \"NP\"), vocalist Elle, and drummer Ikuo Taketani of the Japanese experimental groups The Boredoms and Hanatarashi. The group released its debut record, \"How to Kill\", on Null's own NUX Organization label later that year. With bassist Bunsho Nishikawa replacing Elle, they released the \"Vast Impotenz\" cassette early in 1988.\n\nFollowing the departure of Suzuki and Nishikawa, Null and Taketani were ultimately joined by permanent guitarist Mitsuru Tabata (also of The Boredoms) in 1988, and the group released the album \"Maximum Love and Fuck\". Tatsuya Yoshida of the progressive rock band Ruins also joined later this year, replacing Taketani. They released the \"Maximum Money Monster\" album in 1990, packaging \"Maximum Love and Fuck\" with additional tracks featuring Yoshida on drums.\n\nYoshida left in 1990 and continued his prolific and lauded career with Ruins and in other projects. He was briefly replaced by drummer Yasuko, but Zeni Geva found a longer standing replacement in Eito Noro. This lineup began extensive world tours, catching the eye of such noteworthy rock figures as Steve Albini, who produced their 1991 album \"Total Castration\", and Jello Biafra, who signed them to his Alternative Tentacles record label. They next released 1992's \"Live in Amerika\" and the collaborative \"All Right You Little Bastards\" live album with Albini performing with the band. The Albini-produced \"Desire for Agony\" marked Zeni Geva's Alternative Tentacles debut, and was followed by 1995's \"Freedom Bondage\".\n\nNoro left the band in 1996, and the band toured with temporary replacement Blake Fleming, an American musician. Masataka Fujikake joined as drummer shortly thereafter, and the group embarked upon further extensive touring. Despite this activity, the band did not release another studio album until 2001, six years after \"Freedom Bondage\". Their next record, \"10,000 Light Years\", was released on the Neurot Recordings label, and marked their most experimental effort. Null had been making increasing use of electronic instruments of his own design, and his \"nulltron\" device featured prominently on \"10,000 Light Years.\" A live album, \"Last Nanosecond - Live in Geneva 2002\", followed in 2004.\n\nFujikake departed, and the band was inactive for the next several years. Null remained prolific via solo and collaborative releases, while Tabata worked with several projects, including Acid Mothers Temple. \"Maximum Money Monster\" was remastered and re-released with bonus tracks in 2007.\n\nIn 2009, Yoshida rejoined Zeni Geva, and they returned to touring. The live album \"Alive and Rising\", recorded in September 2009 and released in February 2010, captured a live performance from this incarnation of Zeni Geva. \"Total Castration\", remastered by Null, followed on the Nux Organization label in 2012.

The station covered 16 square miles and Armstrong's homestead was on the east side of Surf Coast Highway.\n\nBetween 1847 and 1850 Assistant Surveyor William Pickering began work mapping the Duneed Parish and lots of c. 640 acres became available for purchase.

{"id": "2217913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217913", "title": "Hemiballismus", "text": "Hemiballismus\n\nHemiballismus or hemiballism in its unilateral form is a very rare movement disorder. It is a type of chorea caused in most cases by a decrease in activity of the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia, resulting in the appearance of flailing, ballistic, undesired movements of the limbs. It can also appear rarely due to certain metabolic abnormalities. It is a rare movement disorder, being 500 times rarer than Parkinson's disease. Hemiballismus can cause significant disability. Symptoms can decrease during sleep. \n\n\"Ballism\" was defined by Meyers in 1968 as \"Repetitive, but constantly varying, large amplitude involuntary movements of the proximal parts of the limbs. This activity is almost ceaseless and movements are often complex and combined\". Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities. The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion. They are continuous and random and can involve proximal or distal muscles on one side of the body. Some cases even include the facial muscles. It is common for arms and legs to move together. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements. Physicians can measure the severity of the disorder by having the patient perform a series of basic, predetermined tasks and counting the hemiballistic movements during a set time session. The physicians then rate the patient on a severity scale. This scale gives scientists and clinicians a way to compare patients and determine the range of the disorder.\n\nThe name \"hemiballismus\" literally means \"half ballistic\", referring to the violent, flailing movements observed on one side of the body.\n\nIn examining the causes of hemiballismus, it is important to remember that this disorder is extremely rare. While hemiballismus can result from the following list, just because a patient suffers from one of these disorders does not mean they will also suffer from hemiballismus.\n\nStroke\nHemisballismus as a result of stroke occurs in only about 0.45 cases per hundred thousand stroke victims. Even at such a small rate, stroke is by far the most common cause of hemiballismus. A stroke causes tissue to die due to a lack of oxygen resulting from an impaired blood supply. In the basal ganglia, this can result in the death of tissue that helps to control movement. As a result, the brain is left with damaged tissue that sends damaged signals to the skeletal muscles in the body. The result is occasionally a patient with hemiballismus.\n\nTraumatic Brain Injury\nHemiballismus can also occur as a result of a traumatic brain injury. There are cases in which victims of assault or other forms of violence have developed hemiballismus. Through these acts of violence, the victim’s brain has been damaged and the hemiballistic movements have developed.\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\nThis disease causes neuronal loss and gliosis, which can include the subthalamic nucleus and other areas of the brain. Essentially any disorder that causes some form of neuronal loss or gliosis in the basal ganglia has the potential to cause hemiballismus.\nNonketotic Hyperglycemia\nPatients with nonketotic hyperglycemia can develop hemiballismus as a complication to the disease through the development of a subthalamic nucleus lesion. This is the second most common reported cause of hemiballismus. It can be found primarily in the elderly and many of the reported cases have come from East Asian origin, which suggests that there may be some genetic disposition to development of hemiballismus as a result of hyperglycemia. Hemiballistic movements appear when blood glucose levels get too high and then subside once glucose levels return to normal. This time scale for this is usually several hours. In patients with this type of hemiballismus, imaging reveals abnormalities in the putamen contralateral to the movements as well as the globus pallidus and caudate nucleus. While the hyperglycemia itself is not the cause of the hemiballistic movements, it has been suggested that petechial hemorrhage or a decreased production of GABA and acetylcholine could result secondary to the hyperglycemia. One of these issues could be responsible for the hemiballistic movements.\n\nNeoplasms\nA neoplasm is an abnormal growth of cells. Cases have shown that if this occurs somewhere in the basal ganglia, hemiballismus can result.\n\nVascular malformations\nVascular malformations can cause abnormal blood flow to areas of the brain. If too little blood is delivered to the basal ganglia, a stroke can occur.\n\nTuberculomas\nThis is another form of tumor that can result in the brain as a result of a tuberculous meningitis infection. This type of tumor can also damage parts of the basal ganglia, sometimes resulting in hemiballismus.\n\nDemyelinating plaques\nDemyelinating plaques attack the myelin sheaths on neurons. This decreases the conduction velocity of the neurons, making the signals received by the basal ganglia garbled and incomplete. This disorganized signal can also cause the chaotic movements characterized by hemiballismus.\n\nComplications from HIV infection\nPatients with HIV often have complications that arise along with AIDS. Hypoglycemia due to pentamidine use in patients with AIDS has been known to cause hemiballismus. In some patients, hemiballismus has been the only visible symptom to alert the physician that the patients may have AIDS. It is typically a result of a secondary infection that occurs due to the compromised immune system and the most common infection causing hemiballismus is cerebral toxoplasmosis. Most of the lesions that result from this infection are found in the basal ganglia. As long as the diagnosis is not missed, this type of hemiballismus can be treated just as well as in patients without HIV.\n\nBasal ganglia\nThe basal ganglia are a collection of nuclei that connects to several other areas of the brain. Due to the diverse nuclei that they contain, the basal ganglia are involved in numerous functions, including motor control. It is within this structure that hemiballismus primarily occurs in the brain.\n\nSubthalamic nucleus\nThis structure within the basal ganglia innervates other structures, including a very important connection to the inside of the globus pallidus. The subthalamic nucleus essentially provides the excitement needed to drive the globus pallidus. Injury to this area or its efferent or afferent connections can induce this disorder contralateral to the side of the lesion. The structure itself is a regulator of motor function and is also involved in associative and limbic functions. It was traditionally thought that the disorder was only caused by injury to the subthalamic nucleus, but new studies are showing that damage to other areas of the brain can also be responsible for causing this disorder. Hemiballismus caused by lesions in the subthalamic nucleus is more severe than other forms of the disorder.\n\nGlobus pallidus\nFrom recent studies, it is now thought that hemiballismus can be associated with a decreased output of the globus pallidus. This is because studies have shown that firing rates decrease from 70/s to 40/s. In addition to a decreased firing rate, degenerative neurological disorders that cause patients to exhibit hemiballistic movements show a marked decrease in the globus pallidus mass as well. Increases in activity in this area causes there to be an inhibition of the motor thalamus. This causes cortical activation and thus a movement inhibition. In the case of hemiballismus, the opposite occurs, leading to the characteristic large, irregular movements.\n\nPutamen\nThe putamen is also part of the basal ganglia and can be involved in hemiballismus due to the fact that it projects to the premotor cortex through the globus pallidus. As a result, damage to this area can also cause hemiballistic movements to be seen as it is also part of the chain in movement.\n\nCaudate nucleus\nThe caudate nucleus is the portion of the basal ganglia that helps control voluntary movement. Damage to this area can also result in hemiballismus as it is directly related to voluntary movement.\n\nCortical structures\nWhile the majority of damage that causes hemiballismus occurs within the basal ganglia, there are still cases that have been documented on which damage to cortical structures has caused hemiballistic movements.\n\nDiagnosis of hemiballismus is a clinical one, made with observation during clinical examination. Hemiballismus is a clinical sign with a variety of differing etiologies. Therefore a diagnosis underlying this clinical sign should be sought. The observer should note sudden, flinging movements of a limb(s) and occasionally the face. This is commonly unilateral (\"Hemiballismus\"). The movements must be distinguished from other hyperkinetic movement disorders such as tremor (generally more rhythmic, and smaller amplitude) and chorea, akathisia and athetosis (all are often of lower amplitude and less violent)\n\nWhen treating hemiballismus, it is first important to treat whatever may be causing the manifestation of this disorder. This could be hyperglycemia, infections, or neoplastic lesions. Some patients may not even need treatment because the disorder is not severe and can be self – limited.\n\nDopamine Blockers\nWhen pharmacological treatment is necessary, the most standard type of drug to use is an antidopaminergic drug. Blocking dopamine is effective in about ninety percent of patients. Perphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine are standard choices for treatment. Scientists are still unsure as to why this form of treatment works, as dopamine has not been directly linked to hemiballismus.\n\nAnticonvulsants\nAn anticonvulsant called topiramate has helped patients in three cases and may be a viable treatment for the future.\n\nITB Therapy\nIntrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy is used to treat a variety of movement disorders such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. It can also be a possibility to help treat hemiballismus. In one case, before ITB the patient had an average of 10-12 ballism episodes of the right lower limb per hour. During episodes, the right hip would flex up to about 90 degrees, with a fully extended knee. After an ITB pump was implanted and the correct dosage was found, the frequency of ballistic right leg movements decreased to about three per day, and the right hip flexed to only 30 degrees. The patient was also able to better isolate individual distal joint movements in the right lower limb. The patient currently receives 202.4 microg/day of ITB and continues to benefit almost 6 years after the ITB pump was implanted.\n\nBotulinum Injections\nNew uses for botulinum toxin have included treatment of hemiballismus. However, this is still in the early stages of testing. This treatment deals with the muscular manifestations of hemiballismus as opposed to the neurological causes.\n\nTetrabenazine\nTetrabenazine has been used to treat other movement disorders, but is now being used to treat hemiballismus. Patients using this medication have had a dramatic response. However, lowering the dosage leads to a return of symptoms. This drug works by depleting dopamine.\n\nAntipsychotics\nIn one case, a patient had not been responding to haloperidol, thus the physician tried olanzapine. The patient made a significant recovery. More research is being performed on the use of these types of drugs in treating hemiballismus.\n\nFunctional Neurosurgery\nSurgery as a treatment should only be used on patients with severe hemiballismus that has not responded to treatment. Lesioning of the globus pallidus or deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus are procedures that can be used on humans. Usually, lesioning is favored over deep brain stimulation because of the maintenance required to continue stimulating the brain correctly and effectively.\n\nIn the past, the prognosis for patients with this disease had been very poor; with many patients suffering from severe disability or death. Now, patients are responding remarkably well to current treatments and the majority of patients go into spontaneous remission. For those that do not go into remission, the symptoms of hemiballismus can generally be very well controlled with medication.\nDue to the rarity of this disorder, scientists know very little about the details of hemiballismus.\n\n•There appears to be a discrepancy between this disorder in humans and animals that has yet to be explained.\n\n•Hemiballismus can also be induced by damage to other areas of the basal ganglia besides the subthalamic nucleus. Research is being done in these areas in order to give scientists and clinicians a better model for this disease that will ultimately lead to better diagnosis and treatment of this disorder.\n\n•Research is also being done on why certain treatments seem to help hemiballistic patients when they should seemingly do more harm. An example of this is why lesioning the globus pallidus seems to reduce hemiballistic movements.\n\n•The mechanism behind the effect of dopamine on patients’ symptoms remains unknown.\n\nThe work of J.R. Whittier, F.A. Mettler, and M.B. Carpenter in the mid 1900s helped scientists and clinicians form a more complete picture of hemiballismus. In their experiments, several lesions were made in the basal ganglia structures in monkeys and then they monitored the results. They noticed that the majority of the time, the monkeys did not have any unusual movements. However, when at least twenty percent of the subthalamic nucleus was damaged, abnormal movements were seen in the limbs opposite to the side of the brain that was damaged. This observation caused scientists to believe that hemiballismus outside the subthalamic nucleus did not occur. It was not until much later that this classical model began to expand to include other areas of the basal ganglia and even some cortical structures. They also noticed that unlike human patients, the unusual movements in the monkeys were mainly in the lower extremities. In about half of the monkeys, the hemiballismus continued until the monkey died.\n\nOther scientists have also worked on this perplexing disorder and have found that the symptoms can be induced by injecting kainic acid or ibotenic acid into the subthalamic nucleus. I. Hamada and M.R. DeLong found that by using these chemicals, they could destroy only four percent of the subthalamic nucleus and still see hemiballistic movements. However, the abnormal movements would usually disappear within four to five hours even though it did not appear as though the damaged tissue had healed. This suggests that the subthalamic nucleus is plastic enough to adapt to small amounts of damage in order to resume normal function.\n\n"}

Initially it was responsible to collect the newly imposed duties on liquor. As commodities became subject to duties, the scope of the Preventive Service broadened to include tobacco and hydrocarbon oil, as well as duties related to the government opium monopoly. During times of war, the service prevented the export of precious metals and other commodities to the enemies of the United Kingdom and its allies. In 1963, with the passage of the Preventive Service Ordinance, the service gained the legal status to make regulations on its discipline, functions, powers and terms of service. In 1977, it was renamed the \"Hong Kong Customs and Excise Service\". On 1 August 1982, \"The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department\" became independent from the Trade and Industry Department.\n\nThe C&ED is an active member of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). It exchanges intelligence and works closely with overseas Customs administrations and law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn 2000, to tackle cybercrime, the Computer Forensic Laboratory, the Computer Analysis & Response Team, and the Anti-Internet Piracy Investigation Team were established.\nThese specialised establishments prominently enhanced Customs' enforcement capability and the credibility of digital evidence presented to the courts. The Customs Computer Forensic Laboratory offers professional assistance in collecting, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence to law court in customs related cases.\nThe digital forensic analysts from the laboratory are qualified to testify as expert witnesses in court of law. The forensic laboratory has been awarded ISO 9001 on quality management and ISO 27001 (BS 7799) on information security since 2006. The Hong Kong Customs Computer Forensic Laboratory is the first government unit of HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) to implement ISO 27001. In 2013, the Electronic Crime Investigation Centre was set up within the department\n\nThe department is headed by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise. As at 1 January 2019, the department has an establishment of 7,387 posts, of which nine are directorate officers, 6,222 are members of the Customs and Excise Service, 480 are Trade Controls Officers and 676 are staff of the General and Common Grades.\n\nThere are five branches:\n\nThis is responsible for matters relating to dutiable commodities under the purview of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the international customs liaison and co-operation and the overall staff management and general administration of the Customs and Excise Service, including staff training, planning and provision of resources and departmental facilities; and the housekeeping of the Office of Dutiable Commodities Administration, the Customs Liaison Bureau, the Office of Management Services, the Office of Service Administration and the Office of Training and Development.\n\nThis is responsible for matters relating to import and export controls under the purview of the Security Bureau and the housekeeping of the Airport Command, Control Points Command and the Ports and Maritime Command.\n\nThis branch is responsible for matters relating to recreational drugs and anti-smuggling activities under the schedule of the Security Bureau and issues relating to intellectual property under the purview of the Commerce, Industry and Technology Bureau; formulation of policies and strategies regarding the application of intelligence and risk management in :customs operations and the housekeeping of the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau, the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau, the Intelligence Bureau, the Revenue and General Investigation Bureau, the money service operator licensing system and the Syndicate Crimes Investigation Bureau.\n\nThis branch is responsible for trade controls matters under the schedule of the Commerce, Industry and Technology Bureau and consumer protection matters under the schedule of the Economic Development and Labour Bureau, and comprises the Textiles Tactical Investigation Bureau, the Trade Inspection and Verification Bureau, the Trade Investigation Bureau, the General Investigation and Systems Bureau and the Consumer Protection and Prosecution Bureau.\n\nThis is responsible for all matters concerning departmental administration, financial management, information technology development and internal audit. The branch comprises the Office of Departmental Administration, the Office of Financial Administration, the Office of Information Technology, the Internal Audit Division and the Information Unit.\n\nAs with all of the HK Disciplined Services, British-pattern ranks and insignia continue to be utilised, the only change being the exchange of the St. Edward's Crown for the Bauhinia flower crest post-1997.\n\n\nThe current crest of the force was adopted in 1997 to replace most of the colonial symbols:\n\nSource: Customs and Excise Department [Hong Kong]\n\nThe C&E officers are trained in the use of, and issued when required, revolvers as sidearms for lethal protection and an ASP expendable baton and Sabre Red pepper spray for less-than-lethal options on the field as same as the other disciplinary force members. Semi-automatic pistols are issued to the section tasked with providing witness protection. Members are also trained in the use of shotguns and sub-machine guns, however such long arms are rarely used.\n\nOfficers are required to go to the range at least twice a year after their graduation. While most members of the HK CED are not routinely armed, the personnel that do routinely carry sidearms are those staff responsible for dealing with serious crimes, anti-narcotics and armed escort stationed at the various ports, along with the members of the Special Task Force.\n\n\nThere are no tariffs on goods entering Hong Kong, but excise duties are charged on four groups of commodities: hydrocarbon oil, liquor, methyl alcohol and tobacco. The duties apply equally to imported commodities and those manufactured locally for domestic consumption.\n\nIn 2003, the C&ED collected $6,484 million excise duty. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, the C&ED controls breweries, distilleries, tobacco factories, oil installations, ship and aircraft duty-free stores, and industrial and commercial establishments dealing with dutiable commodities; and supervises licensed, general bonded and public bonded warehouses.\n\nLicences are issued to those who import, export, manufacture or store dutiable commodities. The C&ED also assesses the First Registration Tax of vehicles under the Motor Vehicle (First Registration Tax) Ordinance. The Anti-illicit Cigarette Investigation Division is specially tasked to detect syndicated smuggling, distribution and peddling of dutiable cigarettes. The Diesel Oil Enforcement Division focuses its efforts on detecting the smuggling and misuse of illicit fuels.\n\nThe C&ED prevents and detects smuggling activities under the Import and Export Ordinance and enforces the licensing controls on prohibited articles by inspecting cargoes imported and exported by air, sea and land; processing passengers and their baggage at entry /exit points; and searching aircraft, vessels and vehicles entering and leaving Hong Kong. The Joint Police/Customs Anti-Smuggling Task Force is dedicated to combating smuggling activities by sea. The Control Points Investigation Division is tasked to strengthen the intelligence collection capability at the land boundary and suppress the cross-boundary smuggling activities.\n\nThe smuggling of frozen meat to mainland China, using barges and powerful speedboats off the west coast of Hong Kong, remains a serious problem, with an estimated 600 tonnes being transshipped every day. Despite frequent operations, the department is able to intercept only a fraction - a total of 1,050 tonnes in 2019.\n\nThe Hong Kong International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world with a daily arrival of about 257 scheduled flights, bringing into Hong Kong a daily average of 25,989 passengers and 2,838 tonnes of imported cargo. In 2003, the throughput of air passengers was 19 million whereas the throughput of air cargoes was about 2.64 million tonnes.\n\nHong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world, handling 20.4 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) in 2003. Of these, 12.1 million TEUs were handled at the Kwai Chung Container Terminal. In 2003, 70,910 ocean-going ships and 365,190 coastal vessels entered and left Hong Kong.\n\nShips and vessels are subject to customs check. Cargoes are either examined on board sea freighters or after off-loading.\n\nIn 2003, a total of 8.6 million passengers arrived in Hong Kong from the Mainland and Macau by sea and by helicopters. They were processed at the China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui and the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal in Central. In addition, a daily average of 49 helicopter flights between Hong Kong and Macau are operated at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal. Four Customs launches conduct maritime patrol in the territorial waters round the clock whereas four high-speed pursuit crafts and two shallow water patrol launches are employed to carry out interception at sea.\n\nOn average, 156,339 passengers arrive from the Mainland by land daily and they are processed at Man Kam To, Sha Tau Kok, Lok Ma Chau and Lo Wu control points. Additionally, 2,991 passengers enter Hong Kong by through-trains and are processed at Hung Hom Railway Station. Goods imported by road are checked at Man Kam To, Sha Tau Kok and Lok Ma Chau. In 2003, over 20 million tonnes of cargoes were imported through the land boundary control points.\n\n\nThe C&ED and the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) are responsible for anti-drug law enforcement. Seizures of illicit drugs in 2003 included 52.87 kilograms of heroin, 562.15 kilograms of herbal cannabis, 24.46 kilograms of cannabis resin, 8.33 kilograms of cocaine, 41.1 kilograms and 1,272 tablets of methylamphetamine, 35.56 kilograms and 141,038 tablets of ecstasy-type tablets (MDMA, etc.), 51.3 kilograms and 238 tablets of ketamine, and substantial quantities of various narcotics, analgesics and tranquillisers.\n\nA total of 8,652 persons were arrested for drug offences, including 2,827 for major offences such as drug trafficking and manufacturing, with the remaining 5,825 for minor offences such as possession of illicit drugs.\n\nAs well as intercepting smuggled drugs at entry/exit control points, the department launches proactive investigations and surveillance operations on syndicated drug trafficking activities throughout Hong Kong. The department can deploy drug detector dogs and advanced technologies, such as mobile x-ray vehicle scanning and inspection systems, to assist anti-drug work.\n\nIn addition, the department closely monitors trends in illicit drug use, in particular the growing popularity of psychotropic substances among the young and cross boundary drug crimes. The C&ED also investigates laundering of drug proceeds and initiates applications for freezing and confiscating assets derived from drug trafficking. Suspected drug-related assets worth $1.18 million were frozen, awaiting confiscation proceedings.\n\nThe department enforces a licensing system to control the import, export and dealing of 25 specific precursor chemicals which can be used for the manufacture of dangerous drugs. It exchanges intelligence and co-operates closely with the HKPF and various drug enforcement agencies on the Mainland and overseas in the fight against drug traffickers both locally and at international level.\n\nThe C&ED safeguards the certification and licensing systems which are of vital importance to Hong Kong's trading integrity. The department deters and investigates offences of origin fraud, circumvention of textiles licensing and quota control. It also investigates offences of import and export of strateg commodities and other prohibited articles not under and in accordance with a licence.\n\nThe department carries out cargo examination at control points, factory inspections, factory audit checks and consignment checks. It is also the department's enforcement strategy to administer a monetary reward scheme to encourage the supply of information on textile origin fraud.\n\nThe department is a member of the Hong Kong Compliance Office set up to assist the Central People's Government in implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention in Hong Kong. The department enforces licensing control on rice and consumer protection legislation relating to weights and measures, markings on fineness of precious metals, and safety of toys, children's products and consumer goods. The department also verifies import and export declarations to ensure accurate trade statistics and assesses and collects declaration charges and the clothing industry training levy.\n\nIn 2002/03, the department collected $848 million in declaration charges and $19.9 million in clothing industry training levies.\n\nThe C&ED has the mission to defend the interests of intellectual property rights owners and legitimate traders through staunch enforcement of the Copyright Ordinance, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance and the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance.\n\nThe department investigates and prosecutes copyright offences relating to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, sound recordings, cinematographic films, broadcasts and other published works under the Copyright Ordinance. It also takes enforcement action against commercial goods with forged trademark or false label under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.\n\nAt the manufacture level, the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance requires local optical disc and stamper manufacturers to obtain licences from the department and mark on all their products specific identification codes. The Import and Export Ordinance imposes licensing controls on the import and export of optical disc mastering and replication equipment. A 147-strong Special Task Force has also been playing an important role in combating copyright piracy, and serves as a mobile brigade to reinforce the suppression of other customs-related crimes.\n\nThe C&ED is an active member of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). It exchanges intelligence and works closely with overseas customs administrations and law enforcement agencies. The department has also entered bilateral Cooperative Arrangements with other customs authorities on administrative assistance. At the working level, the department and the Mainland customs have each established designated liaison officers to facilitate the exchange of intelligence through direct telephone hotlines.\n\nIn 2003, the C&ED seized a total of $1,244 million worth of goods. They included illicit drugs valued at $45 million; infringing goods worth $229 million; counterfeit goods worth $120 million; smuggled merchandises worth $541 million; dutiable commodities worth $284 million.\n\nDuring the year, the C&ED prosecuted 7,184 persons and firms under various laws enforced by the department.\n\nFines amounted to $31.83 million and 4,351 custodial sentences, aggregated to 1,671 years and 11 months, were imposed on convicted persons. Among the prosecutions, 803 were cases relating to unlawful commercial malpractices such as violation of licensing controls of strategic commodities, supplying false information in applications for certificate of origin, textile licensing frauds and contravention of consumer protection legislation.\n\n\n\n"}

The suburb is primarily residential and is often praised for its peacefulness and abundance of trees. Pinelands is one of the few areas in Cape Town in which sale of alcohol to the public is prohibited, but some clubs have private liquor licenses. It is a popular place for senior citizens to retire to. While there are several retirement homes in the suburb, younger people are increasingly moving in.\n\nThe main road is called Forest Drive and the suburb contains two small shopping centres, namely Howard Centre (named after Ebenezer Howard who led the garden city movement) and Central Square. Dutch Reformed, Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist and Catholic (Society of St. Pius X) churches are located near to Central Square, while Baptist, Church of England in South Africa and mainstream Catholic churches are located elsewhere in the suburb. Pinelands is served by two Metrorail railway stations: Pinelands station on the western edge of the suburb and Mutual station on the northern edge. The suburb is bisected from the north east to the south west by the Elsieskraal River, which has flowed through a large concrete drainage canal since the 1970s. Elsieskraal River also flows through the neighbouring suburb of Thornton, which is a similar residential suburb with an abundance of trees.\n\nThe postcodes for Pinelands are 7405 for street addresses and 7430 or 7450 for post office boxes. The telephone exchange codes for Pinelands are predominantly 531 and 532 (within the 021 dialling code for Cape Town).\n\nThe layout of Pinelands is based on the revolutionary town planning ideas of Sir Ebenezer Howard, and was the first attempt at a town-planned area in South Africa. Over 6,000 Cape Town citizens had succumbed to the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic and in order to combat the overcrowding which had been a major contributing factor in the spread of disease, Pinelands became the first Garden City to be developed in South Africa. It was originally a Victorian era farm named Uitvlugt that had thousands of pine trees planted in it, and was later deemed an economic failure by the Department of Forestry. The land was then granted to \"The Garden Cities Trust\" and the founding Deed of Trust was signed in 1919. One of the first members of the trust, Richard Stuttaford (head of the department store \"Stuttafords\"), made a £10,000 gift donation to serve as capital, and a loan of £15,000 from the government was invested in Pinelands. The trust brought in an overseas expert, Albert John Thompson, in 1920 to design the area.\n\nThe first (thatched) house in Pinelands to be occupied was 3 Mead Way and was built in February 1922. The house and entire street, including The Mead were declared a national monument in 1983. The original township area is currently a proposed heritage area. Pinelands converted to a municipality in 1948 and in 1996 merged into the City of Cape Town metropolitan municipality. The old Pinelands Town Council offices now accommodate the Pinelands Subcouncil.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, the population of Pinelands was 14,198 people in 4,917 households. The following tables show various demographic data about Pinelands from that census.\n\nPinelands is part of ward 53 of the City of Cape Town. The ward also includes Thornton, Maitland Garden Village, Epping Industria 1, Ndabeni and part of Maitland; the current ward councillor is Brian Watkyns of the Democratic Alliance. He has represented the area for 35 years and is also the Chairperson of the Pinelands Subcouncil. Of the six voting districts in this ward, three of them cover Pinelands: the voting stations are at the Pinelands Town Hall, Pinelands High School, and Pinehurst Primary School. Generally, the majority of voters in the Pinelands area of the Ward, vote for the Democratic Alliance.\n\nThe following tables show the sum of the votes cast in the three Pinelands voting districts at the most recent national, provincial and local elections.\n\nMany of the road names in Pinelands have originated from local history or from places in England. One such road is named Uitvlugt (original Dutch) after the historical farm of the same name that covered what is now Pinelands. There are also roads named Letchworth and Welwyn after the first two garden cities in England. Other roads in Pinelands are named after places in the Lake District in England, the Royal Family as well as the names of birds, trees and flowers. Curiously, despite the attitude displayed to the sale of alcohol in Pinelands, there is a section where all the roads are named after well known wine farms.\n\nIn Pinelands there are three public primary schools, each of which is commonly known in the community by a colour: Pinelands Primary School (\"The Blue School\"), Pinelands North Primary School (\"The Red School\") and Pinehurst Primary School (\"The Green School\"). Pinelands High School is a public high school, centrally located in the suburb. Cannons Creek Independent School is a private combined primary and high school. Grace Primary School is a Christian primary school embracing a Charlotte Mason education philosophy. There are three private pre-primaries in Pinelands: Meerendal Pre-Primary, La Gratitude Pre-Primary, Learn and Play Centre Pre-School and Old Mutual for their employees. The high school campus of Vista Nova (a school for children with cerebral palsy and other special needs) is located in the suburb. The Pinelands Campus of the College of Cape Town while located in Maitland is on the northern edge of Pinelands and draws students from all over Cape Town.\n\nPinelands has sporting facilities including tennis and lawn bowling clubs. Other sports include the cricket and hockey clubs situated at The Oval sports grounds situated on St. Stephens Road just off Forest Drive. Pinelands hockey club was founded in 1937 and is currently one of the largest clubs in the country fielding 12 men’s teams and 7 ladies teams in the Western Province Hockey Union league. Both the men’s and ladies’ first teams play in the Grand Challenge league with the men's team having won the title for the first time in 2006. In 2008 Pinelands Hockey Club produced three Olympians – Marvin Bam, Paul Blake and Austin Smith. Austin Smith was made the South African Men's Captain, having first played hockey for the Red School and the Pinelands High School.\n\nIn January 1949, the municipal council assumed a coat of arms, designed by F. de Beaumont Beech. It registered the arms with the Cape Provincial Administration in July 1954 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in July 1979. \n\nThe arms were : \"Or, on a chevron Gules, between three fir-cones Sable, slipped and leaved Vert, three annulets Or\" (i.e. a golden shield depicting, from top to bottom, two black fir-cones with green leaves, a red chevron displaying three golden rings, and another black fir-cone with green leaves). The crest was a squirrel holding an acorn, and the motto was \"Fides – prudentia – labor\".\n\n\n"}

The Showtime comedy stars DeVito and Rhea Perlman, and features Huntz Hall, Michael Richards, George Wendt and Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nVic DeSalvo (Danny DeVito) and his brother Goody are successful New Jersey trucking magnates, but Vic has a desire to make it big as a Hollywood producer. He hawks his scripts and ideas from one network executive to another, but he is turned down at each attempt.\n\nFinally, he meets an executive at a second-rate company who has just been fired for promoting a show that attracted zero viewers. To avenge himself, he accepts Vic's script and arranges for a pilot episode of \"Sittin' Pretty\", to be filmed. The resultant episode is abysmally awful, both in acting and story, but Vic is only inspired to greater heights. The director and star actor walk out and Vic decides to act as well as write and direct.\n\nHe throws a huge party to make himself known to \"le tout Hollywood\", but no one comes, except Francine (Rhea Perlman), a statistician at a ratings agency. They fall in love.\n\nWhen Francine is passed over for a promotion by her philandering and incompetent boss, she reveals to Vic how the ratings system can be bypassed and results fixed by setting up confederates in Nielsen-ratings households to skew the results. They conspire to run a scam that will make Vic's program the most-watched on television.\n\nThe scam works and Vic is voted the best new actor at a grand awards ceremony, showing that many viewers (in addition to the confederates) watched his shows. But the agency has now discovered the scam, and as soon as Vic has accepted his award, he is arrested by the police.\n\nFrancine and Vic are married in jail.\n\n\n\"The Ratings Game\" was the first original movie financed by Showtime.

He led the 1635 settlement of Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, which was named after his home village, now a suburb of Chelmsford in Essex, England; and Captain Elizur Holyoke, the namesake of the mountain, Mount Holyoke, and (indirectly), of the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts.\n\nHis father was William Pumpelly, son of John Pumpelly and Hannah Bushnell. His father was great grandson of Jean Pompilie, a sea captain who settled at Plymouth, Massachusetts. He was a French Huguenot refugee from Avignon, France, originally from Spoleto, Italy.\n\nHis mother, Mary Hollenbeck Welles (born in Athens, Pennsylvania, 6 May 1803; died in Paris, France, 4 December 1879), was a poet. She was the daughter of Prudence Talcott and George Welles (a 1779 graduate of Yale College.) She wrote religious historical poems, including \"Belshazar's Feast,\" \"Pilate's Wife's Dream,\" \"Herod's Feast,\" and \"An Ode to Shakespeare.\" Some of these were collected and published in a volume (New York, 1852).\n\nPumpelly attended common schools and graduated from Owego Academy in Owego, Tioga County, New York. Against his parents objections, he decided against attending Yale University and chose to study and travel in Europe. He graduated in 1859 from the \"Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg\" (Translation from the German: Freiberg University of Mining and Technology \"or\" Freiberg Mining Academy, University of Technology; TUBAF). He also attended the polytechnic school in Hanover. After graduating, he traveled extensively through the mining districts of Europe for the purpose of studying geology and metallurgy by direct observation.\n\nAfter graduating, Pumpelly moved to Tioga Point, now Athens, in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, where he was soon appointed a Justice of the Peace, and became land agent for the Hon. Charles Carroll of Carrollton, Maryland. Carroll held a license as innkeeper in Athens from 1798 to 1809. It was said of him that he was a man of ability, and became possessed of large amount of property.\n\nIn 1860 Pumpelly was engaged in mining operations in Arizona.\nInvited by the respective governments, from 1861 to 1863 he surveyed Yesso Island of Japan. and the coalfields of northern China After this, he made the first extensive survey of the Gobi Desert, and explored Mongolia and Siberia.\n\nFrom 1866 to 1875, he was Professor of Mining Science at Harvard University. Among his scientific accomplishments was a theory of secular rock disintegration. He was influenced by Louis Agassiz.\n\nIn June 1870, he was living in a rooming house in Cambridge, Mass., where former slave and abolitionist author Harriet Jacobs also resided.\n\nFrom 1870 to 1871, he conducted the geological survey of the copper region of Michigan, for which he prepared \"Copper-Bearing Rocks,\" being part ii of volume i of the \"Geological Survey of Michigan\" (New York, 1873). He was called upon in 1871 to conduct the geological survey of Missouri, and for three years devoted his energies to that task, preparing \"A Preliminary Report on the Iron Ores and Coal Fields,\" with an atlas, for the report of the \"Geological Survey of Missouri\" (New York, 1873).\n\nWhen the U. S. Geological Survey was established in 1879, Pumpelly organized the division of economic geology, and as a special agent of the Tenth Census he planned and directed the investigations on the mining industries, exclusive of the precious metals, and prepared volume xv of the \"Census Reports\" on \"The Mining Industries of the United States\" (Washington, 1886). From 1879-80, he conducted at Newport, Rhode Island, an elaborate investigation for the National Board of Health as to the ability of various soils to filter spores from liquids and from air. He became a resident of Newport in 1879, and lived there for 44 years.\n\nIn 1879 Pumpelly introduced the idea that the numerous lakes of the Canadian Shield are the result of the creation of basins due to the stripping of an irregular mantle of weathered rock by glacier erosion. This idea was subsequently adopted by Alfred Gabriel Nathorst used it to explain the great number of lakes existing in southern Sweden.\n\nIn 1881, he organized the Northern Transcontinental Survey for the Northern Pacific Railroad and published parts of his report in the Tenth Census. This survey collected information concerning the topographical and economic features of Dakota, Montana, and Washington territories. He had charge of this work until its cessation in 1884, and also edited the reports of the survey. He was appointed the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, New England branch, in 1884.\n\nPumpelly spent his summers in Dublin, New Hampshire, near Mount Monadnock, and in 1884 he blazed a trail from his summer house to the summit along a ridge that carries his name. The Pumpelly Trail is considered one of the most scenic on the mountain.\n\nIn 1903, he mounted a Carnegie-funded archeological dig with his son at the Anau mounds in Turkmenistan. (Not far from the site of Gonur Tepe, famously excavated over 60 years later.)\n\nHe was a member of the New Hampshire Society of the Sons of the Revolution. He was president of the Geological Society of America in 1905.\n\nPumpelly died at the age of 86 on August 10, 1923, in Newport, Rhode Island. He is buried in Berkeley Memorial Cemetery in Middletown, Newport County, Rhode Island.\n\n\nHe married on October 20, 1869, at Dorchester, Massachusetts, Eliza Frances Shepard, born March 14, 1840, in Dorchester, Massachusetts and died on February 5, 1915, in Newport, Rhode Island. She was the daughter of Otis Shepard and Ann Pope. Her sister, Rebecca Kettell Shepard married author and publisher George Haven Putnam, the eldest son of publisher George Palmer Putnam and Victorine Haven Putnam. Rebecca and George were the parents of medieval historian Bertha Haven Putnam. Another sister of hers, Lucy Elizabeth Shepard, married the Rev. Dr. Thomas Hill, the son of Thomas Hill, president of Antioch College from 1860 to 1862, and then of Harvard University from 1862 to 1868 and Henrietta Barker.\n\nRaphael and Eliza were the parents of five children. Their daughter, Elise Pumpelly, married Thomas Handasyd Cabot, the son of James Elliot Cabot and Elizabeth Dwight. He was the great grandson of Thomas Handasyd Perkins; and a grand nephew of William Morris Hunt, an American painter. Elise and Thomas were the parents of three children: Thomas Handasyd Cabot, Jr. Elizabeth Dwight Cabot who married Henry Holt, Jr., the son of Henry Holt, founder of Henry Holt and Company and Florence Taber, and Pauline Cabot who married George Pierce Metcalf, son of Stephen Olney Metcalf.\n\n\n\n"}

Murr said that he knew an attempt on his life had been planned for months, and had informed the state security services.\n\nIn parallel with his political endeavors, Murr spent the past twenty years at the helm of \"Group Murr\", founded in 1957 by his father as a construction company operating in the public works sector.\n\nGroup Murr is featured in Forbes' \"TOP 100 MAKING AN IMPACT IN THE ARAB WORLD\" list.\n\nIn 2015, the group holds more than 25 companies operating across three continents and a wide range of segments of the international market, including: Construction, real estate and resort development, Engineering, Consumer products, Aviation services, Security, Commercial services for the shipping industry.\n\nMurr also serves as the Chairman of the Board of the Al Joumhouria News Corporation the publisher of one of Lebanon's leading daily newspaper and of several other thematic periodicals.\n\nAfter stopping publications throughout the Lebanese civil war, under H.E.

Two, Israel cannot bomb bridges and infrastructure in the Christian areas. The Christians were supporting Israel in 2006 until they started bombing their bridges. If Israel has to bomb all of these places in the Shia areas as a matter of operational concern, that is Hizballah's problem.\"\n\nDuring the two and a half hours conversation, Murr seemed intent on ensuring the Army stays out of the way so that Hizballah bears the full weight of an Israeli offensive; Murr wanted to spare the army from a war against Israel, as he said in one of the leaked cables: ´´I do not want thousands of our soldiers to die for no reason.´\"\n"}

{"id": "2217988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217988", "title": "Elgin Cathedral", "text": "Elgin Cathedral\n\nElgin Cathedral is a historic ruin in Elgin, Moray, north-east Scotland. The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds.\n\nThe cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.\n\nThe number of canons had increased to 25 by the time of the Scottish Reformation in 1560, when the cathedral was abandoned and its services transferred to Elgin's parish church of St Giles. After the removal of the lead waterproofing of the roof in 1567, the cathedral fell steadily into decay. The building was still largely intact in 1615 but in the winter of 1637, a storm brought down the roof covering the eastern limb. In the spring of 1711, the central steeple above the crossing collapsed taking the walls of the nave with it. Ownership was transferred from the Church to the Crown in 1689 but that made no difference to the building's continuing deterioration. Only in the early years of the 19th Century did the Crown begin the conservation process—the stabilisation of the structure proceeded through until the end of the 20th Century with the large scale improvements to the two western towers.\n\nThe Diocese of Moray was a regional bishopric unlike the pre-eminent see of the Scottish church, St Andrews, which had evolved from a more ancient monastic Celtic church and administered scattered localities. It is uncertain whether there were bishops of Moray before c. 1120 but the first known prelate—possibly later translated to Dunkeld—was Gregory (or Giric, in Gaelic) and was probably bishop in name only. Gregory was a signatory to the foundation charter of Scone Priory, issued by Alexander I (\"Alaxandair mac Maíl Choluim\") between December 1123 and April 1124, and again in a charter defining the legal rights of the same monastery. He is recorded for the last time when he witnessed a charter granted by David I to Dunfermline Abbey in c. 1128. These actions are all that is known of Gregory with no basis for later assertions that he was a promoted monk in a 'Pictish Church'. After the suppression of Óengus of Moray's rebellion in 1130, King David must have regarded the continued existence of a bishopric in Moray as essential to the stability of the province. Yet the next bishop was the absentee titular bishop William (1152–1162), King David's chaplain who had probably been an aide since 1136 and had likely done little to improve the stability of the see by the time he died in 1162. Felix was the next bishop and is thought to have been prelate from 1166 to 1171 although no accurate dates are known—details of his tenure are almost unknown with only one appearance as a witness in a charter of William the Lion at his court held in Elgin. Following Felix's death, Simon de Toeni, King William's kinsman and a former abbot of Coggeshall, in Essex became the next bishop. Bishop Simon was the first of the early bishops to adopt a hands-on attitude towards his diocese and was said to be buried in Birnie Kirk, near Elgin, after his death on 17 September 1184 although this suggestion first appeared in 18th-century. He was followed by Richard of Lincoln, once again a royal clerk, and one who struggled to build up the revenues of the bishopric during and after the insurgence of Domnall mac Uilleim (Donald MacWilliam). Richard is regarded as the first resident bishop of the see.\n\nThese early bishops had no settled location for their cathedral, and sited it successively at the churches of Birnie, Kinneddar and Spynie. Pope Innocent III issued an apostolic bull on 7 April 1206 that allowed bishop Brice de Douglas to fix his cathedral church at Spynie—its inauguration was held between spring 1207 and summer 1208. A chapter of five dignitaries and three ordinary canons was authorised and based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral. Elgin became the lay centre of the province under David I, who probably established the first castle in the town, and it may have been this castle, with its promise of better security, that prompted Brice, before July 1216, to petition the Pope to move the seat from Spynie. \nDespite Brice's earlier appeal, it was not until Andrew de Moravia's episcopate that Pope Honorius III issued his bull on 10 April 1224 authorising his legates Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop of Caithness, Robert, Abbot of Kinloss and Henry, Dean of Ross to examine the suitability of transferring the cathedra to Elgin. The Bishop of Caithness and the Dean of Ross performed the translation ceremony on 19 July 1224. On 5 July, Alexander II (\"Alaxandair mac Uilliam\") had agreed to the transference in an edict that referred to his having given the land previously for this purpose. The land-grant predated the Papal mandate and could indicate that work on a new church was already underway before Brice's death but this is thought unlikely and that Bishop Andrew commenced the building works on an unoccupied location.Construction of the cathedral was completed after 1242. Chronicler John of Fordun recorded without explanation that in 1270 the cathedral church and the canons' houses had burned down. The cathedral was rebuilt in a larger and grander style to form the greater part of the structure that is now visible, work that is supposed to have been completed by the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296. Although Edward I of England took an army to Elgin in 1296 and again in 1303, the cathedral was left unscathed, as it was by his grandson Edward III during his assault on Moray in 1336.\n\nSoon after his election to the see in 1362–63, Bishop Alexander Bur requested funds from Pope Urban V for repairs to the cathedral, citing neglect and hostile attacks. In August 1370 Bur began protection payments to Alexander Stewart, Lord of Badenoch, known as the Wolf of Badenoch, who became Earl of Buchan in 1380, and who was son of the future King Robert II. Numerous disputes between Bur and Buchan culminated in Buchan's excommunication in February 1390 and the bishop turning to Thomas Dunbar, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection service. These acts by the bishop, and any frustration Buchan may have felt about the reappointment of his brother Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife as guardian of Scotland, may have caused him to react defiantly: in May, he descended from his island castle on Lochindorb and burned the town of Forres, followed in June by the burning of Elgin and the cathedral with its manses. It is believed that he also burned Pluscarden Priory at this time, which was officially under the Bishop's protection. Bur wrote to Robert III seeking reparation for his brother's actions in a letter stating: <br> Robert III granted Bur an annuity of £20 for the period of the bishop's lifetime, and the Pope provided income from the Scottish Church during the following decade. In 1400, Bur wrote to the Abbot of Arbroath complaining that the abbot's prebendary churches in the Moray diocese had not paid their dues towards the cathedral restoration. In the same year Bur wrote to the rector of Aberchirder church, telling him that he now owed three years' arrears of the subsidy that had been imposed on non-prebendary churches in 1397. Again, on 3 July 1402, the burgh and cathedral precinct were attacked, this time by Alexander of Lochaber, brother of Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles; he spared the cathedral but burned the manses. For this act, Lochaber and his captains were excommunicated, prompting Lochaber's return in September to give reparation and gain absolution. In 1408, the money saved during an ecclesiastic vacancy was diverted to the rebuilding process and in 1413 a grant from the customs of Inverness was provided. Increasingly, the appropriation of the parish church revenues led in many cases to churches becoming dilapidated and unable to attract educated priests. By the later Middle Ages, the standard of pastoral care outside the main burghs had significantly declined.\n\nBishop John Innes (1407–14) contributed greatly to the rebuilding of the cathedral, as evidenced by the inscription on his tomb praising his efforts. When he died, the chapter met secretly—\"\"in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie Moraviensis\"\"—and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see, the bishop would grant one-third of the income of the bishopric annually until the rebuilding was finished. The major alterations to the west front were completed before 1435 and contain the arms of Bishop Columba de Dunbar (1422–35), and it is presumed that both the north and south aisles of the choir were finished before 1460, as the south aisle contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435–60). Probably the last important rebuilding feature was the major restructuring of the chapterhouse between 1482 and 1501, which contains the arms of Bishop Andrew Stewart.\n\nThe dignitaries and canons constituted the chapter and had the primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rulebook of St Benedict was read before the business of the day was discussed.\n\nBishop Brice's chapter of eight clerics consisted of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andrew de Moravia, greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (succentor and subdean) and added 16 more prebendary canons. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created by the time of Andrew's death, and a further two were added just before the Scottish Reformation. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de Moravia family, of which Bishop Andrew was a member, is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends.\n\nRural Deans, or \"deans of Christianity\" as they were known in the Scottish Church, supervised the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie, and these provided the income not only for the cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese. Many churches were allocated to support designated canons, and a small number were held in common. The bishop received mensal and prebendary income in his separate positions as prelate and canon.\n\nThe government of the diocese affecting both clergy and laity was vested entirely in the bishop, who appointed officers to the ecclesiastical, criminal and civil courts. The bishop, assisted by his chapter, produced the church laws and regulations for the bishopric and these were enforced at occasional diocesan synods by the bishop or, in his absence, by the dean. Appointed officials adjudicated at consistory courts looking at matters affecting tithes, marriages, divorces, widows, orphans, wills and other related legal matters. In Moray, these courts were held in Elgin and Inverness. By 1452 the Bishop of Moray held all his lands in one regality and had Courts of Regality presided over by Bailiffs and Deputies to ensure the payment of revenues from his estates.\n\nLarge cathedrals such as Elgin had many chapel altars requiring canons, assisted by a plentiful number of chaplains and vicars, to perform daily services. Bishop Andrew allowed for the canons to be aided by seventeen vicars made up of seven priests, five deacons and five sub-deacons—later the number of vicars was increased to twenty-five. In 1350 the vicars at Elgin could not live on their stipends and Bishop John of Pilmuir provided them with the income from two churches and the patronage of another from Thomas Randolph, second Earl of Moray. By 1489 one vicar had a stipend of 12 marks; six others, 10 marks; one, eight marks; three, seven marks, and six received five marks; each vicar was employed directly by a canon who was required to provide four months' notice in the event of his employment being terminated. The vicars were of two kinds: the vicars-choral who worked chiefly in the choir taking the main services and the chantry chaplains who performed services at the individual foundation altars though there was some overlapping of duties. Although the chapter followed the constitution of Lincoln, the form of divine service copied that of Salisbury Cathedral. It is recorded that Elgin's vicars-choral were subject to disciplinary correction for shortcomings in the performance of the services, resulting in fines. More serious offences could end in corporal punishment, which was administered in the chapterhouse by the sub-dean and witnessed by the chapter. King Alexander II founded a chaplaincy for the soul of King Duncan I who died in battle with Macbeth near Elgin. The chapel most frequently referenced in records was St Thomas the Martyr, located in the north transept and supported by five chaplains. Other chaplaincies mentioned are those of the Holy Rood, St Catherine, St Duthac, St Lawrence, St Mary Magdalene, St Mary the Virgin and St Michael. By the time of Bishop Bur's episcopate (1362–1397), the cathedral had 15 canons (excluding dignitaries), 22 vicars-choral and about the same number of chaplains.\n\nDespite these numbers, not all the clergy were regularly present at the services in Elgin Cathedral. Absence was an enduring fact of life in all cathedrals in a period when careerist clerics would accept positions in other cathedrals. This is not to say that the time spent away from the chanonry was without permission, as some canons were appointed to be always present while others were allowed to attend on a part-time basis. The dean of Elgin was permanently in attendance; the precentor, chancellor, and treasurer were available for half the year. The non-permanent canons had to attend continuously for three months. The chapter decided in 1240 to penalise persistently absent canons who broke the terms of their attendance by removing one-seventh of their income. In the Diocese of Aberdeen and it is assumed in other bishoprics also, when important decisions of the chapter had to be taken, an absentee canon had to appoint a procurator to act on his behalf—this was usually one of the dignitaries who had a higher likelihood of being present. At Elgin in 1488, many canons were not abiding by the terms of their leave of absence, resulting in each of them receiving a formal warning and a summons; despite this, ten canons refused to attend and had a seventh of their prebendary income deducted. The bulk of the workload fell to the vicars and a smaller number of permanent canons who were responsible for celebrating high mass and for leading and arranging sermons and feast day processions. Seven services were held daily, most of which were solely for the clergy and took place behind the rood screen which separated the high altar and choir from lay worshipers. Only cathedrals, collegiate churches and large burgh churches were resourced to perform the more elaborate services; the services in the parish churches were more basic.\n\nThe clergy were augmented by an unknown number of lay lawyers and clerks as well as masons, carpenters, glaziers, plumbers, and gardeners. Master Gregory the mason and Master Richard the glazier are mentioned in the chartulary of the cathedral. \n\nThe chanonry, referred to in the cathedral's chartulary as the \"college of the chanonry\" or simply as the \"college\", was the collection of the canons' manses that were grouped around the cathedral. A substantial wall, over high, thick and around in length, enclosed the cathedral and manses and separated the church community from the laity; only the manse of Rhynie lay outside the west wall. The houses of 17 vicars and the many chaplains were also situated outside the west wall. The wall had four gates: the West Port gave access to the burgh, the North Port provided access to the road to the bishop's palace of Spynie, the South Port opened opposite the hospital of Maison Dieu and the surviving East or Panns Port allowed access to the meadowland called \"Le Pannis\". The Panns Port illustrates the portcullis defences of the gate-houses (Fig. 1). Each canon or dignitary was responsible for providing his own manse and was built to reflect his status within the chapter. The castle having become unsuitable, Edward I of England stayed at the manse of Duffus on 10 and 11 September 1303 as did James II in 1455. In 1489, a century after the incendiary attack on the cathedral and precinct in 1390 and 1402, the cathedral records revealed a chanonry still lacking many of its manses. \nThe chapter ordered that 13 canons, including the succentor and the archdeacon, should immediately \"erect, construct, build, and duly repair their manses, and the enclosures of their gardens within the college of Moray\". The manse of the precentor, erroneously called the \"Bishop's House\", is partially ruined and is dated 1557. (Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.\n\nThe hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andrew de Moravia before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.\n\nThere were two friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563. In 1489, the chapter founded a school that was not purely a song school for the cathedral but was also to be available to provide an education in music and reading for some children of Elgin.\nIn August 1560, parliament assembled in Edinburgh and legislated that the Scottish church would be Protestant, the Pope would have no authority and that the Catholic mass was illegal. Scottish cathedrals now survived only if they were used as parish churches and as Elgin had been fully served by the Kirk of St Giles, its cathedral was abandoned. An act of parliament passed on 14 February 1567 authorised Regent Lord James Stewart's Privy Council to order the removal of the lead from the roofs of both Elgin and Aberdeen cathedrals, to be sold for the upkeep of his army, but the overladen ship that was intended to take the cargo to Holland capsized and sank in Aberdeen harbour. Regent Moray and Patrick Hepburn, Bishop of Moray ordered repairs to the roof in July 1569, appointing Hew Craigy, Parson of Inverkeithing, as master of the work, to collect contributions from the canons of the diocese.\n\nIn 1615, John Taylor, the 'Water Poet', described Elgin Cathedral as \"a faire and beautiful church with three steeples, the walls of it and the steeples all yet standing; but the roofes, windowes and many marble monuments and tombes of honourable and worthie personages all broken and defaced\".\n\nDecay had set in and the roof of the eastern limb collapsed during a gale on 4 December 1637. In 1640 the General Assembly ordered Gilbert Ross, the minister of St Giles kirk, to remove the rood screen which still partitioned the choir and presbytery from the nave. Ross was assisted in this by the Lairds of Innes and Brodie who chopped it up for firewood. It is believed that the destruction of the great west window was caused by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers sometime between 1650 and 1660.\n\nAt some point, the cathedral grounds had become the burial ground for Elgin. The town council arranged for the boundary wall to be repaired in 1685 but significantly, the council ordered that the stones from the cathedral should not be used for that purpose. Although the building was becoming increasingly unstable the chapterhouse continued to be used for meetings of the Incorporated Trades from 1671 to 1676 and then again from 1701 to around 1731. No attempt was made to stabilise the structure and on Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower gave way, demolishing the nave. Following this collapse, the \"quarrying\" of the cathedral's stonework for local projects began. Many artists visited Elgin to sketch the ruins, and it is from their work that the slow but continuing ruination can be observed. By the closing years of the 18th century, travelers to Elgin began to visit the ruin, and pamphlets giving the history of the cathedral were prepared for those early tourists. In 1773 Samuel Johnson recorded, \"a paper was put into our hands, which deduced from sufficient authorities the history of this venerable ruin.\"\n\nSince the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.\n\nIn 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\", and writing: \n\nSome minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers were substantially overhauled with a viewing platform provided at the top of the north tower.\n\nThe first church was markedly cruciform in shape and smaller than the present floor plan. This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides (Fig. 4). The central tower rose above the crossing between the north and south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey. The north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure, dating to the years immediately after the church's 1224 foundation; the clerestory windows on top of it are from the later post-1270 reconstruction. This wall has blocked up windows extending to a low level above ground, indicating that it was an external wall and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle (Fig. 5).\n\nThe south transept's southern wall is nearly complete, displaying the fine workmanship of the first phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued to be used in Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.\n\nThe west front has two 13th century buttressed towers high that were originally topped with wooden spires covered in protective lead. Although the difference between the construction of the base course and the transepts suggests that the towers were not part of the initial design, it is likely that the building process was not so far advanced that the masons could fully integrate the nave and towers into each other (Fig. 7).\n\nAfter the fire of 1270, a programme of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles were added to the nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.\n\nIn June 1390, Alexander Stewart, Robert III's brother, burned the cathedral, manses and burgh of Elgin. This fire was very destructive, requiring the central tower to be completely rebuilt along with the principal arcades of the nave. The entire western gable between the towers was reconstructed and the main west doorway and chapterhouse were refashioned. The internal stonework of the entrance is late 14th or early 15th century and is intricately carved with branches, vines, acorns and oak leaves. A large pointed arch opening in the gable immediately above the main door contained a series of windows, the uppermost of which was a circular or rose window dating from between 1422 and 1435. Just above it can be seen three coats of arms: on the right is that of the bishopric of Moray, in the middle are the Royal Arms of Scotland, and on the left is the armorial shield of Bishop Columba Dunbar (Fig. 11). The walls of the nave are now very low or even at foundation level, except one section in the south wall which is near its original height. This section has windows that appear to have been built in the 15th-century to replace the 13th-century openings: they may have been constructed following the 1390 attack (Fig. 12). Nothing of the elevated structure of the nave remains, but its appearance can be deduced from the scarring seen where it attached to the eastern walls of the towers. Nothing of the crossing now remains following the collapse of the central tower in 1711. Elgin Cathedral is unique in Scotland in having an English style octagonal chapterhouse and French-influenced double aisles along each side of the nave; in England, only Chichester Cathedral has similar aisles. The chapterhouse, which had been attached to the choir through a short vaulted vestry, required substantial modifications and was now provided with a vaulted roof supported by a single pillar (Figs. 13 & 14). The chapterhouse measures high at its apex and from wall to opposite wall; it was substantially rebuilt by Bishop Andrew Stewart (1482–1501), whose coat of arms is placed on the central pillar. Bishop Andrew was the half-brother of King James II. The delay in the completion of these repairs until this bishop's episcopacy demonstrates the extent of the damage from the 1390 attack.\n\nIn 1847–8 several of the old houses associated with the cathedral on the west side were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. Structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, mullions, and decorative ribs in the window in the north-east wall of the chapterhouse (Fig. 15). By 1913, repointing the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century buttressing (Fig. 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (Fig. 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig. 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (Fig. 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (Fig. 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 21).\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n\n"}

In 1944, it was re-equipped with the new Tiger II. The battalion saw action on the Eastern and Western Fronts during World War II. As with other German heavy tank battalions, it was normally not assigned to a single corps, but shuffled around according to war circumstances. Later the battalion became part of the newly formed Panzer Corps Feldherrnhalle as the Feldherrnhalle Heavy Tank Battalion.\n\nThe unit was created on May 4, 1942. The unit consisted of 45 Tiger Is on May 10, 1943. In the aftermath of the Battle of Stalingrad, the battalion was deployed to Army Group Don and arrived at the front on January 1, 1943. The battalion, along with several divisions of the 4th Panzer Army, was tasked with securing the withdrawal of Army Group A; it then retreated to Rostov. On February 11, 1943, the unit was transferred to Kharkiv. It took part in the Third Battle of Kharkov and the Operation Citadel in 1943. Four days before the start of Citadel, the battalion reported that 42 of their 45 Tiger tanks were operational. The unit lost three Tigers during the operation and five more during the subsequent retreat.\n\nIn January 1944, the battalion, together with a panzer regiment and infantry units, formed Panzer Regiment Bäke. The regiment was part of the relief force, which tried to unsuccessfully break through to encircled forces in the Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket. The battalion was then trapped in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. In late April 1944, the regiment was dissolved and sent West for refitting and equipped with 45 new Tiger IIs.\nIn Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, the unit was transferred to the command of 5th Panzer Army. On the launch of Operation Goodwood, the 3rd company, which was based in Cagny, Calvados, was destroyed in the preliminary Allied bombing, with impacts powerful enough to turn a 56-ton Tiger upside down. Only one Tiger was operational at the end of the day. During the first day of Goodwood, the unit reported the loss of thirteen tanks. At the end of July, the 3rd company received new Tiger II tanks, which were subsequently destroyed in the Allied aerial attacks, with only two brought back to Germany.\n\nIn October 1944, the refitted 503rd took part in the Battle of Debrecen. In early-November, the battalion provided a mobile reserve for the 6th Army (Wehrmacht), re-designated as Army Group Hermann Balck. By mid-December, the German forces had been pushed back to Budapest. In January of 1945, the unit took part in several failed attempts to relieve Budapest, code-named Operation Konrad. Though the 17-24 of February, the 503rd took part in one of the last successful German offensives of the war, \"Operation Südwind (G:Southwind).\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2217991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217991", "title": "Ireland cricket team", "text": "Ireland cricket team\n\nThe Ireland cricket team represents all of Ireland in international cricket. The Irish Cricket Union, operating under the brand Cricket Ireland is the sport's governing body in Ireland, and organises the international team. \n\nIreland participate in all three major forms of the international game; Test, One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. They are the 11th Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the second Full Member from Europe, having been awarded Test status, along with Afghanistan, on 22 June 2017.\n\nCricket was introduced to Ireland in the 19th century, and the first match played by an Ireland team was in 1855. Ireland toured Canada and the United States in the late 19th century, and occasionally hosted matches against touring sides. Ireland's most significant international rivalry, with the Scotland national cricket team, was established when the teams first played each other in 1888. Ireland's maiden first-class match was played in 1902.\n\nIreland were elected to Associate membership of the ICC in 1993, but played their first full ODI in 2006 against England in the build-up to the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, their first successful qualification. At that tournament, a series of eye-catching results against Full Members, including a draw against Zimbabwe, and wins against Pakistan and Bangladesh confirmed Ireland's ODI status after the competition. Since then, they have gone on to play 150 ODIs, resulting in 64 victories, 75 defeats, 8 no results, and 3 ties. Contracts for players were introduced in 2009, marking the transition to becoming a professional team. \n\nFurther success in the shortest format meant the Ireland team also qualified for the 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2020 World Twenty20 competitions. \n\nPrior to attaining Test status, Ireland also played first-class international cricket in the ICC Intercontinental Cup, which they have won four times between 2005 and 2013. Due to their successes in the first-class ICC Intercontinental Cup competition, and further high profile wins at the World Cups of 2011 (England) and 2015 (West Indies and Zimbabwe), they were labelled the \"leading Associate\" and stated their intention to become a full member by 2020. This intention was realised in June 2017, when the ICC unanimously decided to award Ireland and Afghanistan Full Member status, which allows them to participate in Test matches.\n\nCricket was introduced to Ireland by the English in the towns of Kilkenny and Ballinasloe in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, the game began to spread; many of the clubs which were founded in the following 30 years are still in existence today. The first Irish national team played in 1855 against The Gentlemen of England in Dublin. In the 1850s, the Englishman Charles Lawrence was responsible for developing the game in Ireland through his coaching. In the 1850s and 1860s, Ireland was visited for the first time by touring professional teams. Ireland's first match against Marylebone Cricket Club (the M.C.C.) was in 1858.\n\nThe game gained popularity until the early 1880s. The land war in the 1880s resulting from the Irish Land Commission and a ban on playing \"foreign\" games, in practice, British, by the Gaelic Athletic Association set back the spread of cricket. The ban was lifted in 1970, and before then anyone playing foreign games, such as cricket was banned from the Irish games such as hurling and Gaelic football. Irish teams toured Canada and the US in 1879, 1888, 1892, and 1909. On top of this, Ireland defeated a touring South African side in 1904. Their first match with first-class status was played on 19 May 1902 against a London County side including W.G. Grace. The Irish, captained by Sir Tim O'Brien, won convincingly by 238 runs.\n\nAfter the 1902 tour of England, where four matches yielded one win, two draws and one loss, Ireland did not play first-class cricket again for five years. Although the team had lost to the South Africans in 1894 – Ireland's first match against a Test-playing nation – Ireland defeated South Africa in 1904; it was the team's first victory against a Test side. In 1909, the first annual first-class match between Ireland and Scotland was held, and an annual match against the MCC was arranged from 1924 onwards.\n\nThe Irish played yearly first-class matches with the Scots, only interrupted by world wars, until 1999, but all their other cricket depended upon touring international sides finding it convenient to include a visit to Ireland in their schedules. However, Ireland sometimes surprised Test nations on these occasions, beating the West Indies by 60 runs in a three-day match in Dublin in 1928, for example; it was Ireland's first match against the West Indies. In 1969, in a match played at Sion Mills in County Tyrone, the team defeated a West Indian side including Clive Lloyd and Clyde Walcott by nine wickets, after bowling them out for 25. This was the last time Ireland defeated a touring side until 2003, when they beat Zimbabwe by ten wickets.\n\nThe Scots and the Irish were mostly competing with Sri Lanka for the title as the best non-Test nation at the time – indeed, Ireland drew with Sri Lanka in a rain-hit first-class match in 1979, Ireland scoring a total of 341 for 7 in two innings, while Sri Lanka made 288 for 6 in one innings. Ireland, along with Scotland and the Netherlands, has at times played in competitions for English county cricket sides, including the Benson & Hedges Cup and the Friends Provident Trophy (previously the C&G Trophy). Since there is no nationality restriction in county cricket, non-Irish people were allowed to compete for Ireland in these matches. For example, Hansie Cronje of South Africa played for Ireland in 1997, as did New Zealander Jesse Ryder in 2007.\n\nIreland joined the ICC as an Associate Member in 1993, a year before Scotland. This meant Ireland could play in the ICC Trophy for the first time in 1994, and they finished seventh in the tournament. Three years later they progressed to the semi-finals of the competition but lost the third place play-off with Scotland, thus missing a place at the 1999 cricket World Cup. Ireland finished eighth in the 2001 tournament. After this, Adrian Birrell was hired as coach.\nWith the introduction of the ICC Intercontinental Cup in 2004, Ireland had a chance to play first-class on a regular basis. After failing to progress beyond the group stages in the 2004 competition, Ireland won their first Cup title in October 2005 with a six-wicket win over Kenya. The 2005 ICC Trophy, which was hosted in Ireland – the group stages in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the final stages in Dublin, Republic of Ireland – saw the Irish make the final, which they lost to Scotland. Though Ireland were runners-up, they had secured their place at the 2007 World Cup as well as an extra $500,000 over the next four years from the ICC to encourage development of Irish cricket. They also gained official ODI status.\n\nIreland's inaugural ODI was played in front of a full house of 7,500 spectators at Stormont, Belfast, on 13 June 2006 against England. It was the first time Ireland had played the full England side. Though Ireland lost by 38 runs, they were praised by Andrew Strauss, England's stand-in captain.\n\nAugust saw them participate in Division One of the European Championship, against Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Scotland. The games against the Netherlands and Scotland had ODI status. In the tournament, and what was the team's second ODI, Ireland recorded their first ODI win, beating fellow Associates Scotland by 85 runs after man-of-the-match Eoin Morgan made 99. Although the match against the Netherlands was a no-result, Ireland won the European Championship title. Ireland's second Intercontinental Cup title came in the 2006–2007 competition. They faced Canada in the final and won by an innings and 115 runs, the four-day match concluding within two days. This made Ireland the first team to successfully defend the Continental Cup.\n\nFor the 2006 season, the C&G Trophy was reorganised to include a round-robin stage instead of being entirely knock-out. Whereas Ireland had only one match guaranteed in the tournament before, they now had more fixtures against English county sides. Ireland recorded one win in their nine matches. Ireland participated in the competition until it was restructured again in 2009. In that time they played 25 matches and won two. The latter of those victories was against Worcestershire; in that match Ireland bowled Worcestershire out for 58, which was their lowest ever one-day total. It was the first time that Ireland had bowled out a county for less than 100. Ireland were invited to participate in the reformatted competition from 2010 onwards, but chose not to do so, and instead focused their limited financial resources on international cricket.\n\nAt the start of 2007, Ireland saw more than three months of almost constant cricket. First was a visit to Kenya, where they took part in Division One of the ICC World Cricket League. They finished fifth in the league after four narrow defeats, and Kenya won the league. Before the World Cup, the team participated in a high-performance camp in South Africa. Ireland's performance in their inaugural World Cup in the 2007 Cricket World Cup took many pundits by surprise. In their first game, on 15 March, they tied with Zimbabwe, primarily thanks to Ireland's first ever World Cup century by man-of-the-match Jeremy Bray and economical bowling in the final overs by Trent Johnston and Andre Botha. In their second match, played on Saint Patrick's Day, they beat the fourth-ranked team in the world, Pakistan, by three wickets, thus knocking Pakistan out of the competition. \n\nThese two results were enough to advance Ireland to the Super 8 stage of the tournament. In their final group stage game, the West Indies beat them by eight wickets. In the Super 8 stage, they lost their five matches against England, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and Sri Lanka, but recorded a 74-run victory against Test playing nation Bangladesh, the 9th ranked team in the world. The team received a heroes' welcome in Dublin.\n\nAfter the World Cup, former West Indies cricketer Phil Simmons took over the role of coach from Birrell. India were scheduled to play South Africa in a series of One Day Internationals in Ireland in June 2007. Ireland also played one-off matches at Stormont against the two teams. Missing several players from their World Cup squad, Ireland lost both games. Ireland hosted a quadrangular tournament in Dublin and Belfast in July involving the West Indies, the Netherlands, and Scotland. Ireland and the West Indies both won their games against Scotland and the Netherlands with their direct encounter ending in no result due to rain. The West Indies won the tournament because of a bonus point won against the Netherlands. Trent Johnston stepped down as captain and was replaced by William Porterfield in March 2008.\n\nThe 2007–08 ICC Intercontinental Cup began in June, with Ireland playing their first match in August. In November 2008, the team's campaign ended. After finishing second in the round-robin stage of the competition, Ireland faced Namibia in the final. Ireland won by nine wickets, securing their third consecutive Intercontinental Cup title. In March 2008 Ireland toured Bangladesh, playing three ODIs against the hosts and losing all of them. In July, Ireland played a tri-series against New Zealand and Scotland in Aberdeen but lost both matches.\n\nReigning champions Ireland hosted the European Cricket Championship (Division One) in late July and they won their third European title, winning every match, including the decisive encounter against Scotland by seven wickets. In early August, Ireland hosted five other Associate nations at the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in Belfast; this was Ireland's Twenty20 International debut. Ireland would have faced the Netherlands in the final, however the match was rained off and the teams shared the trophy. By getting to the final of the tournament, Ireland qualified for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England in June 2009. Later in August, Ireland were due to play three ODIs at home against Kenya. Ireland won the first game, the second game could not be finished due to rain and the last match was completely washed out. In October, the team visited Kenya for a tri-series of ODIs with the hosts and Zimbabwe. Only two of Ireland's four games in the round-robin stage could be played, the others were rained off. Ireland lost their first match to Zimbabwe, but won their second against Kenya, though they failed to qualify for the final.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, Ireland were deprived of batsman Eoin Morgan, similarly to Ed Joyce several years earlier, who was selected to play for England, making him ineligible to play for Ireland again. Ireland played their first Twenty20 International against a full ICC member side on 8 June 2009 and in their opening match of the tournament defeated Bangladesh by four wickets and knocked them out of the tournament. Ireland progressed to the second stage of the competition. They were grouped with New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and lost all three of their matches. In 2009, Ireland played nine ODIs, winning the seven they played against Associate nations, losing their only match against a Test team (England), and one match was abandoned.\n\nIreland played 17 One Day Internationals in 2010, winning 11 (including a victory over Bangladesh) and losing six. Ireland were knocked out of the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, hosted by South Africa in April and May, after being beaten by the West Indies and a washed out match against England.\n\nThe 2011 Cricket World Cup was held between February and March and hosted by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. Though Ireland did not progress beyond the first round they secured a historic victory against England. Ireland beat England by 3 wickets with Kevin O'Brien hitting the fastest century in World Cup history, managing the feat in just 50 balls. In passing England's total of 327 for victory, Ireland broke the record for the highest successful run chase in the World Cup.\n\nShortly after the tournament ended, the ICC announced that the World Cups in 2015 and 2019 would contain ten teams; the Associate countries, who were most likely to miss out in a tournament with fewer teams strongly objected, and, led by Ireland, urged the ICC to reconsider. In June the decision was reversed. After the World Cup Ireland played Pakistan, England, and Scotland in ODIs but lost each match. A further ODI against Sri Lanka was rained off. In all, Ireland played 12 ODIs in 2011, winning four.\n\nIreland qualified for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, and were promoted to the ICC ODI Championship, leaving the World Cricket League, but not the ICC Intercontinental Cup. In their first match of the World Cup, Ireland defeated the West Indies by 4 wickets, chasing down 304 runs with 25 balls to spare. \n\nIn their second match they beat the United Arab Emirates by two wickets with four balls to spare; the target was 279. Out of only five successful World Cup chases of 300 runs or more, Ireland have provided three.\n\nIn July 2016, Ireland played in its first five-match ODI series against Afghanistan which ended 2–2 with the first ODI being washed out. In September, Ireland toured South Africa for a one match ODI series against Australia and the hosts but lost both games. At the ICC's board meeting in October, Ireland was awarded first-class status for its domestic competition, the Inter-Provincial Championship.\nIn May 2017, Ireland travelled to England to play a two-match ODI series for the first time, though they ended up losing both games.\n\nIn January 2012 Cricket Ireland chief executive Warren Deutrom publicly declared Ireland's ambition to play Test cricket by 2020. Their desire to achieve Test status was in part to stem the tide of Irish players using residency rules to switch to England for the opportunity to play Test cricket. Deutrom outlined the ambition as he unveiled the new strategic plan for Irish cricket to 2015. The plan set out a series of stretching goals including increasing the number of participants in the game to 50,000, setting a target of reaching 8th in the World rankings, establishing a domestic first-class cricket structure, and reinforcing cricket as the fifth most popular team sport in Ireland.\n\nDeutrom had already sent a letter to the ICC in 2009 stating his board's intention to apply for Full Membership – a potential pathway to Test cricket – and to seek clarification on the process. Former Australian bowler Jason Gillespie said that if Ireland got Test status it \"would be huge news in world cricket, and it would be a massive positive story for the world game\". Following Ireland's victory over the West Indies in the 2015 Cricket World Cup, former fast bowler Michael Holding said that the International Cricket Council should grant Ireland Test status immediately, saying \"they need to be recognised now\". The ICC said in 2015 that Ireland would be granted Test status in 2019 should they win the 2015–17 ICC Intercontinental Cup and beat the 10th ranked Test nation in a four-match Test series in 2018.\n\nHowever, on 22 June 2017, after more than a decade of playing top-class international cricket, full ICC membership was granted to Ireland (along with Afghanistan) at an ICC meeting in London, thus making them the eleventh Test cricket team. In October 2017, the ICC announced that Ireland's first Test match would be at home against Pakistan in May 2018. Ireland played their first 'touring' test in India in March 2019 against fellow newcomers Afghanistan, where they lost by 7 wickets. This is to be followed by a four-day Test match against England at Lord's in July 2019. According to the ICC Future Tours Programme for 2019–23, Ireland are scheduled to play sixteen Tests, but along with Afghanistan and Zimbabwe, are not included in the first two editions of the ICC World Test Championship.\n\nIn October 2019, Andrew Balbirnie was appointed Test and ODI captain and one month later, in November he also took over the captaincy of T20I from Gary Wilson, thus becoming all format captain for Ireland.\n\nThe Irish Cricket Union (ICU) – the governing body of Irish cricket – was officially founded in 1923, although its predecessor had been active since 1890. In common with a number of other Ireland sporting governing bodies, the Union was formed to represent cricket throughout the island of Ireland, rather than just the Republic of Ireland. In common with its counterparts for rugby union, rugby league and field hockey, the Union therefore does not use the Irish tricolor, but instead employs its own flag, which is used by such bodies as the International Cricket Council to represent the team and in ICC tournaments; \"Ireland's Call\" is used as the national anthem.\n\nIn 2007, the ICU announced major changes to bring it into line with the main cricket governing bodies. After the World Cup, Irish cricket had poor results in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy, as many players were unavailable. The Irish cricket team was an amateur side and most of the players had full-time jobs with commitments conflicting with cricket.\n\nWarren Deutrom, the chief executive of the ICU, has stated that it wants to \"seek actively to place Irish players into top-level cricket, by developing relationships with [especially] county cricket which will incorporate appropriate player release for Irish international duty, and feeder systems for developing Irish cricketers\". The reorganised ICU sought closer links with the English county teams, to encourage the development of age group cricket, and to introduce a professional element into the Irish game. They also want to take the Ireland cricket team on winter tours more often.\n\nIn an attempt to prevent the game losing players to counties or other commitments such as jobs, it was suggested that central contracts should be introduced. This was done in June 2009, with the first two going to Trent Johnston and Alex Cusack. The number of full-time contracts was expanded to six in January 2010 with support for a further nine players; the contracts were split into three categories. In January 2012 the number of contracts was increased to 23, and coach Phil Simmons highlighted the process of becoming professional as an important factor in the team's success.\n\nIn test matches, Ireland wears cricket whites, with the optional sweater or vest with a green v-neck with the Cricket Ireland logo on the centre. The shirts feature the Cricket Ireland logo on the right breast, the manufacturer logo on the sleeve and the sponsor logo on the left breast. The fielders wear a navy blue cricket cap or a white sunhat with the Cricket Ireland logo. The batsman helmets are coloured similarly. In limited-overs cricket, Ireland wears an emerald green (in ODI) or lawn green (in T20) uniform with navy blue and white accents and feature the Cricket Ireland logo on the right breast, the sponsor logo on the centre and the manufacturer logo on the left breast. The fielders wear a dark blue baseball-style cap or sunhat.\nIn ICC-regulated tournaments, the sponsor logo goes to the non-leading arm sleeve, making space for the inscription \"IRELAND\" written in white, on the centre section of the shirt.\nThe sponsor is Turkish Airlines and the manufacturer is O'Neills.\n\n‡ Only the matches between Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands in the 2006 tournament have official ODI status.\n\nThis lists all the active players who have played for Ireland in the past year (since 19 January 2020) and the forms in which they have played, or any players (in italics) outside this criteria who have been selected in the team's most recent squad. In addition, it includes all 19 players contracted by Cricket Ireland in January 2020, apart from Tim Murtagh and Stuart Poynter who retired from international cricket in 2019.\n\nKey\n\n\nInternational match summary – Ireland\n\n\nMost Test runs for Ireland\nMost Test wickets for Ireland\n\nTest record versus other nations\n\n\nMost ODI runs for Ireland\nMost ODI wickets for Ireland\n\nHighest ODI scores for Ireland\n\n\nODI record versus other nations\n\n\nMost T20I runs for Ireland\n\nMost T20I wickets for Ireland\n\nHighest T20I scores for Ireland\n\nT20I record versus other nations\n\n\nMost first-class runs\n\nMost first-class wickets\n\nHighest individual innings\n\nNote: Ivan Anderson's 198* v.

{"id": "2217996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217996", "title": "Reverse video", "text": "Reverse video\n\nReverse video (or invert video or inverse video or reverse screen) is a computer display technique whereby the background and text color values are inverted. On older computers, displays were usually designed to display text on a black background by default. For emphasis, the color scheme was swapped to bright background with dark text. Nowadays the two tend to be switched, since most computers today default to white as a background color. The opposite of reverse video is known as \"true video\".\n\nVideo is usually reversed by inverting the brightness values of the pixels of the involved region of the display. If there are 256 levels of brightness, encoded as 0 to 255, the 255 value becomes 0 and vice versa. A value of 1 becomes 254, 2 of 253, and so on: \"n\" is swapped for \"r\" - \"n\", for \"r\" levels of brightness. This is occasionally called a ones' complement. If the source image is of middle brightness, reverse video can be difficult to see, 127 becomes 128 for example, which is only one level of brightness different. The computer displays where it was most commonly used were monochrome and only displayed two values so this issue seldom arose.\n\nReverse video is commonly used in software programs as a visual aid to highlight a selection that has been made as an aid in preventing description errors, where an intended action is performed on an object that is not the one intended. It is more common in modern desktop environments to change the background to other colors such as blue, or to use a semi-transparent background to \"highlight\" the selected text.\n\nOn a terminal understanding ANSI escape sequences, the reverse video function is activated using the escape sequence CSI 7 m (which equals SGR 7).\n\nReverse video is also sometimes used for accessibility reasons. When most computer displays were light-on-dark, it was found that users looking back and forth between a white paper and dark screen would experience eyestrain due to their pupils constantly dilating and contracting. Flicker was also an issue with early white-background displays. Today, people with visual impairments such as ocular toxocariasis may find it less tiring to the eyes to work with a predominantly black screen, since modern operating systems usually display a lot of white in a normal use. For the same, white-dominant reason, reverse video is an efficient way to read or write text in a dark environment, since the darkness of the screen may blend into the darkness of the environment.\n"}
{"id": "2218001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218001", "title": "Skerryvore", "text": "Skerryvore\n\nSkerryvore (from the Gaelic An Sgeir Mhòr meaning \"The Great Skerry\") is a remote island that lies off the west coast of Scotland, south-west of the island of Tiree. Skerryvore is best known as the name given to the lighthouse on the skerry, built with some difficulty between 1838 and 1844 by Alan Stevenson.\n\nAt a height of it is the tallest lighthouse in Scotland. The shore station was at Hynish on Tiree (which now houses the Skerryvore Lighthouse Museum); operations were later transferred to Erraid, west of Mull. The remoteness of the location led to the keepers receiving additional payments in kind. The light shone without a break from 1844 until a fire in 1954 shut down operations for five years. The lighthouse was automated in 1994.\n\nIn pre-historic times the rocks that now form Skerryvore were covered by the ice sheets that spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides. After the last retreat of the ice around 20,000 years ago, sea levels were up to lower than at present. Although the isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task, circa 14,000 BP it is likely that the reef was at the south western end of a large island consisting of the modern islands of Tiree and Coll and the surrounding land.\n\nSteadily rising sea levels would then have slowly isolated and finally all but submerged the shoals of Skerryvore, a barrier of innumerable metamorphic remnants that stretch for 8 miles (13 kilometres) lying in a south-westerly direction. A detailed survey undertaken in 1834 listed more than 130 main rocks including \"Am Bonn Sligheach\" (Boinshley) () and \"Am Bogha Ruadh\" ().\n\nThe rocks have been worn smooth by the action of the waves and are constantly affected by spray. Alan Stevenson wrote: \"The effect of the \"jet d'eau\" was at times extremely beautiful, the water being so broken as to form a snow-white and opaque pillar, surrounded by a fine vapour in which, during sunshine, beautiful rainbows were observed \".\n\nIt is an isolated outpost of the Inner Hebrides archipelago composed of Lewisian gneiss, formed in the Precambrian eon, these rocks being amongst the most ancient rocks in Europe. A further hazard to shipping is a magnetic anomaly in the area.\n\nBetween 1790 and 1844 more than thirty ships were known to have been wrecked in the area. Robert Stevenson, chief engineer of the Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB) landed on the reef in 1804 and reported on the need for a beacon of some kind there. In 1814 he returned in the company of Sir Walter Scott and a party of NLB Commissioners. Scott wrote:\nLater that year an Act of Parliament was passed enabling construction of a lighthouse, yet despite pleas for a light arriving almost weekly at the NLB, events proceeded only slowly. It was not until 1834 that Robert Stevenson returned in the company of his son Alan. A painstaking survey made it clear that there was little choice for a location. The single largest area was a rock that measured only at low tide. Readings for wave pressure indicated that any tower would have to withstand forces of . There were suggestions that a tower of cast iron or bronze might be sufficient, but Stevenson senior wrote that \"no pecuniary consideration could in my opinion have justified the adoption of an iron lighthouse for Skerryvore.\" On more than one occasion the surveyors had to warn passing vessels of the danger. A ship from Newcastle, whose charts showed only the main rock some miles away, was boarded near Bo Ruadh. The Master, oblivious to the dangers, was found lying at ease smoking a pipe with his wife beside him knitting stockings.\n\nStill the Commissioners prevaricated, daunted by the potential costs, estimated by Robert Stevenson at £63,000. They set up a special Skerryvore Committee, whose members decided to visit the site by steamer to see for themselves. Just off Skerryvore a fire broke out in the boiler room crippling the ship. It was extinguished and no harm was done, but the experience may have been persuasive.\n\nAlan Stevenson was duly appointed as the engineer for the project aged only 30. He designed a tower high with a base of , narrowing to just at the lantern gallery. The lowest sections would be solid, although at  feet high they were less than half the height of the base of the later light at nearby Dubh Artach. Nonetheless the structure would weigh and the volume of the base would be more than 4 times larger than the entire structure of the Eddystone light and twice that of the Bell Rock. With 151 steps to the top it would be the tallest and heaviest lighthouse yet built anywhere in the modern world, and today it is still one of the tallest lighthouse in the United Kingdom.\n\nHynish on Tiree was the initial shore station and construction site. Located on the south west corner of Tiree, its proximity to Skerryvore and the resulting abundance of bounty from the wrecks, led to rentals being higher here and on the rest of the west coast than elsewhere on the island. Work on the new facilities began in 1837; granite blocks were quarried from Mull and brought to the village to be cut and shaped before being shipped out to the reef. Several cottages for the keepers were built in 1844 from the same stone as well as a massive pier and a tall granite tower to enable signalling to and from Skerryvore itself. Stevenson remarked that the hive of activity there contrasted with the \"desolation and misery\" he imagined to be the lot of the surrounding population.\n\nIn 1838 £15,000 in wages alone was spent on constructing a 150-ton steamer in Leith to ferry workers and materials out to the reef. The difficulties should not be underestimated. Although Skerryvore is a dozen miles (19 km) from Hynish it is from the mainland. The first work to be undertaken on Skerryvore itself was the construction of a six-legged frame on top of which a wooden barrack to house 40 men was placed. The building was created in Gourock before being dismantled and re-built on site.\n\nInitial work began on the rock on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the sailing vessel \"Pharos\" and began to unload the barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock. After only two days the site had to be abandoned as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume the punishing schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4 am and 8 pm. Fearing sea sickness, many of the man preferred to attempt to sleep on the damp rocks than on the ever-rolling \"Pharos\".\n\nWork for the season lasted only until 11 September, by which time the barrack legs had been secured although not the main structure. Less than two months later Stevenson received a letter from the storekeeper at Hynish, Mr. Hogben. It began: \"Dear Sir, I am extremely sorry to inform you that the barrack erected on Skerryvore Rock has totally disappeared.\" The structure had been destroyed during a gale on 3 November and four months effort had been wasted. Stevenson hired a boat to take him out to inspect the damage the same day he received this news. Firm in his self-belief, he resolved to build a stronger but otherwise identical replacement. Work began in April 1839 and by early September the completed barrack stood above the rock. Entry was via ladders attached to the legs that led into the lowest level containing a kitchen. The middle level contained two cabins, one for Stevenson, the other for his master of works, whilst the top level provided sleeping quarters for a further 30 to 40 men.\n\nWork on the foundations for the lighthouse continued until 30 September. A total of 296 charges were used to remove of rock and Stevenson believed that the rock was so hard that the effort involved was four times that required for boring Aberdeenshire granite. The work went well but by the end of the second season, no blocks had yet been laid. However, between April 1839 and June 1840 4,300 blocks had been fashioned, the stone donated by the Duke of Argyll from quarries on Mull. The roughly hewn rock was taken to Hynish where the blocks were hammered and chiselled into shape. The largest weighed over , the smallest and the precision required meant that a single block could take 320 worker-hours to complete.\n\nThe new barrack withstood the violence of the storms during the winter of 1839–40. Work re-commenced on the rock on 30 April 1840, and after the arrival of the new steamer \"Skerryvore\" the carefully fashioned blocks began to arrive on site. The first one was laid by John Campbell, 7th Duke of Argyll on 4 July. His son George later wrote:\nSoon up to 95 blocks a day were arriving from Hynish, although the weather continued to play its part. During the summer of 1840 the steamer was unable to reach the reef for fourteen consecutive days, and on another occasion no landings were possible for seven weeks and supplies began to run low. When work ceased again in the autumn, 800 tons of granite standing high stood on Skerryvore, and up to 80 craftsmen continued to labour on the blocks at Hynish all winter. The first three courses of the base are of hard Hynish gneiss, the remainder are granite from the Ross of Mull.\n\nWork continued during 1841–42, a crane being used to hoist the huge blocks as the tower rose. The last one was raised to the parapet in July 1842. Robert Stevenson, then aged 70, visited the site on his last annual voyage of inspection. The walls at the base are thick, and thick at the top. The lightroom and lantern sit above nine apartments in diameter. The total cost of the works undertaken by the Northern Lighthouse Board was £86,977, including the cost of establishing the shore station at Hynish, estimated at £13,000. It is a credit to Stevenson, his foreman Charles Stewart, and Captain Macurich the landing master, that not a single life was lost during the construction.\n\nThe final season of work in 1843 was spent in fitting out the interior. By then Alan had become chief engineer to the NLB and the final work was undertaken under the supervision of his brother Thomas. The light, which had eight lenses revolving around a four wick lamp with pyramidal lenses above and reflecting prisms below each one, was constructed by John Milne of Edinburgh. The machinery was ready by the beginning of 1844, but it was seven weeks before a landing could be undertaken on the rock. The lamp was finally lit on 1 February and it shone without interruption for the next 110 years.\n\nSkerryvore was Alan Stevenson's greatest achievements from both an engineering and aesthetic perspective. No philistine, he chose a hyberbolic curve for the outline for stylistic reasons. His nephew Robert Louis described it as \"the noblest of all extant deep-sea lights\" and according to the Northern Lighthouse Board it is \"asserted by some that Skerryvore is the world's most graceful lighthouse\".\n\nSuch are the hazards of the surrounding reefs that the lighthouse is not normally approached by shipping. However, completion of the construction work did not result in an end to the difficulties for those involved in its operations. The easiest landing is at Riston's Gully, which intersects the rock near the tower. An unaided landing has been described as \"like climbing up the side of a bottle\". A system of ropes attached to a derrick was installed to assist these dangerous operations. Statistics compiled for the two decades from 1881–1890 showed Skerryvore as having been the stormiest part of Scotland. There were a total of 542 storms lasting 14,211 hours during that period. One keeper lost his hearing for several weeks, after a lightning strike had thrown him through the entrance door.\n\nJames Tomison, who became a keeper in 1861, wrote of the bird migrations visible from the tower: \"Hundreds of birds are flying about in all directions, crossing and re-crossing one another's flight, but never coming into collision, all seemingly of the opinion that the only way of escape out of the confusion into which they have got is through the windows of the lantern\". A fog bell had been installed by then, one of only two operating in Scotland at the time.\n\nThe adverse conditions faced by the keepers resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, but the remote location suited some veterans. Archibald McEachern was assistant keeper for 14 years from 1870–84 and John Nicol was principal from 1890–1903. The latter was involved in a dramatic rescue when the liner \"Labrador\" en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool ran aground on the nearby Mackenzie's Rock in 1899. The lifeboats were manned and two made it to Mull, but one with eighteen passengers reached the lighthouse where they were looked after for two and a half days before they could be taken to the mainland. No lives were lost and Nicol and his two assistants were commended by the NLB for their efforts.\n\nJohn Muir, who served as a keeper with the NLB for 39 years all told, had a posting to Skerryvore from 1902 to 1914. He helped complete a new \"landing grating\", as the slender metal walkway was called, that made landings possible in conditions previously considered \"hopeless\". He baked his own bread and scones and made an inlaid table and Iona marble inkstand.\n\nNumerous dignitaries visited the light in the ensuing years. William Chambers, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh came in 1866 and wrote:\nThe visual similarity between Skerryvore and Dubh Artach 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the south east, led to the NLB painting a distinctive red band round the middle section of the latter in 1890. The Hynish Shore Station had the advantage of proximity to the site during the construction period. However, the small harbour offered little shelter for shipping. The keepers operated from here until 1892 when operations were transferred to Erraid adjacent to the Isle of Mull. Other than the signal tower, the land and buildings on Tiree were sold to George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll who had witnessed the laying of the first stone on Skerryvore fifty-two years previously. A paddle steamer, \"Signal\", built by Laird of Greenock in 1883 was based at Erraid for relief operations. The shore station was moved to Oban in the 1950s.\nIn 1916 mines were laid in the vicinity of the rock by the German submarines SM U-71 and SM U-78. In July 1940 during World War II a stick of bombs was dropped by a passing German plane. The explosion cracked two lantern panes and shattered one of the incandescent mantles.\n\nA disastrous fire started on the seventh floor on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.\n\nA helipad was constructed in 1972 to enable relief trips to be undertaken without the need for perilous sea landings. The lighthouse has been fully automated since 31 March 1994 and is monitored via a radio link to Ardnamurchan lighthouse.\n\nThe Hynish tower has been converted to house the Skerryvore Lighthouse Museum, run by the Hebridean Trust who have also restored the pier. It is now possible to visit Skerryvore with Tiree-based Tiree Sea Tours.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes can be associated with senile plaque deposits. These deposits can also be a byproduct of senescence (ageing). However, large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. The plaques are variable in shape and size, but are on average 50 μm in size. In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic.\n\nIn 1892 Paul Blocq and Gheorghe Marinescu first described the presence of plaque deposits in grey matter. As a result of their similarity to actinomyces druses, they were called \"druse necrosis\" by Oskar Fischer during the early 20th century. The connection between plaques and dementia was discovered by Alois Alzheimer in 1906. By 1911 Max Bielschowsky proposed the amyloid-nature of plaque deposits. The same year Teofil Simchowicz introduced the term senile plaques. Wisniewski coined the term neuritic plaques in 1973. The second half of the 20th century saw proposed theories of immunological and genetic factors in plaque formation. Statistical investigations were performed by J.A.N. Corsellis and M. Franke in the 1970s. M. Franke showed that a demential disease is likely to occur when the number of senile plaques in the frontal cortex is more than 200/mm. By 1985 beta amyloid formations were successfully identified through biochemical techniques, though many unsolved questions about the importance and formation of senile plaques remained.\n\nConcentrated in the synapse of neurons is an amyloid precursor protein (APP) that extends across the plasma membrane. A portion of this protein contains an Aβ peptide sequence. This region comprises part of the DNA segment spanning APP that codes for proteins.\n\nIn the formation of senile plaques, Aβ is cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein. Although three enzymes can process APP, only β-(beta) and γ-(gamma) secretase are directly involved in the formation of senile plaques. β-secretase (BACE) is a protease enzyme that cleaves proteins and peptides. This protease cleaves APP to further expose the carboxyl terminal fragments of Aβ. After the bulk of APP is released by this process, γ-secretase cleaves the remaining carboxyl fragments on the transmembrane domain. The sequential actions of γ-secretase following BACE activity results in Aβ protein fragments (amyloid beta) that are released into the extracellular space. Eventually, the accumulation of amyloid beta outside of neuronal synapses forms an aggregate mass of plaque that pushes aside fine ramifications and connections of brain cells.\n\nThe formation of amyloid beta fragments is a normal occurrence in the human body. However, the accumulation of Aβ leading to the formation of plaque deposits is an unusual phenomenon. Although the cause of this abnormality is largely unknown, research has revealed certain species of amyloid beta that differ by a few amino acids in length that readily aggregate into plaques. These species are more pathogenic.\n\nSenile plaques are visible in light microscopy using the staining techniques of silver, Congo red, Thioflavin, cresyl violet, and PAS-reaction. Plaque deposits are also visible through fluorescence and immunofluorescence microscopy. Bielschowsky silver staining was found to be the least efficient means of visualizing senile plaques whereas Campbell and Gallyas silver staining techniques showed improved identification and accuracy. Using Congo red, only one-fourth of senile plaques present were noticeably stained. Senile plaques may also be visualized with an immunostain directed against beta amyloid. The primary problem with the above staining methods is that sections of the neural tissue must be excised from the brain in order to accurately identify senile plaques. This is problematic because removing neural tissue can be as detrimental as the actual plaques themselves.\n\nAn important criterion of the neuropathological-histological verification of Alzheimer's disease is the formation of senile plaques. Beta amyloid peptides associated with senile plaques have been found to play a central role in the risk, onset, and progression of Alzheimer's disease as well. Of particular importance is the longer species of beta amyloid known as beta amyloid 42. Elevated levels of beta amyloid, as well as an elevation in the ratio of beta amyloid 42 to the shorter major species of beta amyloid 40, has been identified as important in early events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nOther factors in Alzheimer's disease verification include pathological neurofibrillaries, tangles, and atrophic brain with hydrocephalus. The formation and the distribution of the pathological neurofibrillaries have a regularity and allows one to determine the stage of the disease. In combination with the occurrence of a great number of plaques, Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed with high probability. A correlation between the presence of senile plaques and Down syndrome has also been verified.\n\nSenile plaques can be found in human and animal brains (e.g. mammals and birds). From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%), the proportion of people with senile plaques increases linearly. A small proportion of plaques that form can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than men. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdaloid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain.\n\nAn increasing variety of compounds that reduce beta amyloid levels are being identified. Several of these compounds have beta amyloid 42 selectivity whereas others attempt to modulate amyloid precursor protein. Such compounds are now reaching clinical evaluation to determine how they may be of benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n"}

It is common to use the LMS color space when performing chromatic adaptation (estimating the appearance of a sample under a different illuminant). It's also useful in the study of color blindness, when one or more cone types are defective.\n\nTypically, colors to be adapted chromatically will be specified in a color space other than LMS (e.g. sRGB). The chromatic adaptation matrix in the diagonal von Kries transform method, however, operates on tristimulus values in the LMS color space. Since colors in most colorspaces can be transformed to the XYZ color space, only one additional transformation matrix is required for any color space to be adapted chromatically: to transform colors from the XYZ color space to the LMS color space. However, many color adaption methods, or color appearance models (CAMs), use matrices to convert to spaces other than LMS (and sometimes refer to them as LMS or RGB or ργβ), and apply a von Kries-like diagonal matrix in that space.\n\nThe CAT matrices for some CAMs in terms of CIEXYZ coordinates are presented here.\n\n\nThe Hunt and RLAB color appearance models use the Hunt-Pointer-Estevez transformation matrix (M) for conversion from CIE XYZ to LMS.

{"id": "2218040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218040", "title": "Crystallographic restriction theorem", "text": "Crystallographic restriction theorem\n\nThe crystallographic restriction theorem in its basic form was based on the observation that the rotational symmetries of a crystal are usually limited to 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. However, quasicrystals can occur with other diffraction pattern symmetries, such as 5-fold; these were not discovered until 1982 by Dan Shechtman.\n\nCrystals are modeled as discrete lattices, generated by a list of independent finite translations . Because discreteness requires that the spacings between lattice points have a lower bound, the group of rotational symmetries of the lattice at any point must be a finite group (alternatively, the point is the only system allowing for infinite rotational symmetry). The strength of the theorem is that \"not all\" finite groups are compatible with a discrete lattice; in any dimension, we will have only a finite number of compatible groups.\n\nThe special cases of 2D (wallpaper groups) and 3D (space groups) are most heavily used in applications, and they can be treated together.\n\nA rotation symmetry in dimension 2 or 3 must move a lattice point to a succession of other lattice points in the same plane, generating a regular polygon of coplanar lattice points. We now confine our attention to the plane in which the symmetry acts , illustrated with lattice vectors in the figure.\n\nNow consider an 8-fold rotation, and the displacement vectors between adjacent points of the polygon. If a displacement exists between any two lattice points, then that same displacement is repeated everywhere in the lattice. So collect all the edge displacements to begin at a single lattice point. The edge vectors become radial vectors, and their 8-fold symmetry implies a regular octagon of lattice points around the collection point. But this is \"impossible\", because the new octagon is about 80% as large as the original. The significance of the shrinking is that it is unlimited. The same construction can be repeated with the new octagon, and again and again until the distance between lattice points is as small as we like; thus no \"discrete\" lattice can have 8-fold symmetry. The same argument applies to any \"k\"-fold rotation, for \"k\" greater than 6.\n\nA shrinking argument also eliminates 5-fold symmetry. Consider a regular pentagon of lattice points. If it exists, then we can take every \"other\" edge displacement and (head-to-tail) assemble a 5-point star, with the last edge returning to the starting point. The vertices of such a star are again vertices of a regular pentagon with 5-fold symmetry, but about 60% smaller than the original.\n\nThus the theorem is proved.\n\nThe existence of quasicrystals and Penrose tilings shows that the assumption of a linear translation is necessary. Penrose tilings may have 5-fold rotational symmetry and a discrete lattice, and any local neighborhood of the tiling is repeated infinitely many times, but there is no linear translation for the tiling as a whole. And without the discrete lattice assumption, the above construction not only fails to reach a contradiction, but produces a (non-discrete) counterexample. Thus 5-fold rotational symmetry cannot be eliminated by an argument missing either of those assumptions. A Penrose tiling of the whole (infinite) plane can only have exact 5-fold rotational symmetry (of the whole tiling) about a single point, however, whereas the 4-fold and 6-fold lattices have infinitely many centres of rotational symmetry.\n\nConsider two lattice points A and B separated by a translation vector r. Consider an angle α such that a rotation of angle α about any lattice point is a symmetry of the lattice. Rotating about point B by α maps point A to a new point A'. Similarly, rotating about point A by α maps B to a point B'. Since both rotations mentioned are symmetry operations, A' and B' must both be lattice points. Due to periodicity of the crystal, the new vector r' which connects them must be equal to an integer multiple of r:\n\nwith formula_2 integer. The four translation vectors, three of length formula_3 and one, connecting A' and B', of length formula_4, form a trapezium. Therefore, the length of r' is also given by:\n\nCombining the two equations gives:\n\nwhere formula_7 is also an integer. Bearing in mind that formula_8 we have allowed integers formula_9. Solving for possible values of formula_10 reveals that the only values in the 0° to 180° range are 0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, and 180°. In radians, the only allowed rotations consistent with lattice periodicity are given by 2π/\"n\", where \"n\" = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. This corresponds to 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold symmetry, respectively, and therefore excludes the possibility of 5-fold or greater than 6-fold symmetry.\n\nConsider a line of atoms \"A-O-B\", separated by distance \"a\". Rotate the entire row by θ = +2π/\"n\" and θ = −2π/\"n\", with point \"O\" kept fixed. After the rotation by +2π/\"n\", A is moved to the lattice point \"C\" and after the rotation by -2π/\"n\", B is moved to the lattice point \"D\". Due to the assumed periodicity of the lattice, the two lattice points \"C\" and \"D\" will be also in a line directly below the initial row; moreover \"C\" and \"D\" will be separated by \"r\" = \"ma\", with \"m\" an integer. But by the geometry, the separation between these points is: \n\nEquating the two relations gives: \n\nThis is satisfied by only \"n\" = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.\n\nFor an alternative proof, consider matrix properties. The sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix is called the trace of the matrix. In 2D and 3D every rotation is a planar rotation, and the trace is a function of the angle alone. For a 2D rotation, the trace is 2 cos θ; for a 3D rotation, 1 + 2 cos θ.\n\nExamples\nSelecting a basis formed from vectors that spans the lattice, neither orthogonality nor unit length is guaranteed, only linear independence. However the trace of the rotation matrix is the same with respect to any basis. The trace is a similarity invariant under linear transformations. In the lattice basis, the rotation operation must map every lattice point into an integer number of lattice vectors, so the entries of the rotation matrix in the lattice basis — and hence the trace — are necessarily integers. Similar as in other proofs, this implies that the only allowed rotational symmetries correspond to 1,2,3,4 or 6-fold invariance. For example, wallpapers and crystals cannot be rotated by 45° and remain invariant, the only possible angles are: 360°, 180°, 120°, 90° or 60°.\n\nExample\n\nThe general crystallographic restriction on rotations does \"not\" guarantee that a rotation will be compatible with a specific lattice. For example, a 60° rotation will not work with a square lattice; nor will a 90° rotation work with a rectangular lattice.\n\nWhen the dimension of the lattice rises to four or more, rotations need no longer be planar; the 2D proof is inadequate. However, restrictions still apply, though more symmetries are permissible. For example, the hypercubic lattice has an eightfold rotational symmetry, corresponding to an eightfold rotational symmetry of the hypercube. This is of interest, not just for mathematics, but for the physics of quasicrystals under the cut-and-project theory. In this view, a 3D quasicrystal with 8-fold rotation symmetry might be described as the projection of a slab cut from a 4D lattice.\n\nThe following 4D rotation matrix is the aforementioned eightfold symmetry of the hypercube (and the cross-polytope):\nTransforming this matrix to the new coordinates given by \nThis third matrix then corresponds to a rotation both by 45° (in the first two dimensions) and by 135° (in the last two). Projecting a slab of hypercubes along the first two dimensions of the new coordinates produces an Ammann–Beenker tiling (another such tiling is produced by projecting along the last two dimensions), which therefore also has 8-fold rotational symmetry on average.\n\nThe A4 lattice and F4 lattice have order 10 and order 12 rotational symmetries, respectively.\n\nTo state the restriction for all dimensions, it is convenient to shift attention away from rotations alone and concentrate on the integer matrices . We say that a matrix A has order \"k\" when its \"k\"-th power (but no lower), A, equals the identity. Thus a 6-fold rotation matrix in the equilateral triangle basis is an integer matrix with order 6. Let Ord denote the set of integers that can be the order of an \"N\"×\"N\" integer matrix. For example, Ord = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. We wish to state an explicit formula for Ord.\n\nDefine a function ψ based on Euler's totient function φ; it will map positive integers to non-negative integers. For an odd prime, \"p\", and a positive integer, \"k\", set ψ(\"p\") equal to the totient function value, \nφ(\"p\"), which in this case is \"p\"−\"p\". Do the same for ψ(2) when \"k\" > 1. Set ψ(2) and ψ(1) to 0. Using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we can write any other positive integer uniquely as a product of prime powers, \"m\" = ∏ \"p\"; set ψ(\"m\") = ∑ ψ(\"p\"). This differs from the totient itself, because it is a sum instead of a product.\n\nThe crystallographic restriction in general form states that Ord consists of those positive integers \"m\" such that ψ(\"m\") ≤ \"N\".\n\nFor \"m\">2, the values of ψ(\"m\") are equal to twice the algebraic degree of cos(2π/\"m\"); therefore, ψ(\"m\") is strictly less than \"m\" and reaches this maximum value if and only if \"m\" is a prime.\n\nThese additional symmetries do not allow a planar slice to have, say, 8-fold rotation symmetry. In the plane, the 2D restrictions still apply. Thus the cuts used to model quasicrystals necessarily have thickness.\n\nInteger matrices are not limited to rotations; for example, a reflection is also a symmetry of order 2. But by insisting on determinant +1, we can restrict the matrices to proper rotations.\n\nThe crystallographic restriction theorem can be formulated in terms of isometries of Euclidean space. A set of isometries can form a group. By a \"discrete isometry group\" we will mean an isometry group that maps each point to a discrete subset of R, i.e. the orbit of any point is a set of isolated points. With this terminology, the crystallographic restriction theorem in two and three dimensions can be formulated as follows.\n\nIsometries of order \"n\" include, but are not restricted to, \"n\"-fold rotations. The theorem also excludes \"S\", \"S\", \"D\", and \"D\" (see point groups in three dimensions), even though they have 4- and 6-fold rotational symmetry only.\nRotational symmetry of any order about an axis is compatible with translational symmetry along that axis.\n\nThe result in the table above implies that for every discrete isometry group in four- and five-dimensional space which includes translations spanning the whole space, all isometries of finite order are of order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n\nAll isometries of finite order in six- and seven-dimensional space are of order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 24 or 30 .\n\n\n\n"}

It runs directly through the two sides of Mount Moriah Cemetery which spans the border of Southwest Philadelphia and Yeadon, Pennsylvania. It later joins Darby Creek before flowing into the Delaware River.\n\nCobbs Creek used to be called \"Karakung\" by Native Americans.

She spent one year at Northwestern University and then left to pursue her career.\n\nLawrence made her Broadway debut in 1952 in Leonard Sillman's \"New Faces of 1952\". She achieved success in the role of Maria in the original Broadway production of \"West Side Story\" in 1957, and received a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for this role. She played the role for two years, and after an appearance in the short-lived show \"Saratoga\" in 1959 she returned to \"West Side Story\" for its 1960 season. Other Broadway successes were \"Subways Are for Sleeping\", \"I Do! I Do!\" (replacement \"She/Agnes\", 1967) and \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" (1992–93, replacement Spider Woman/Aurora).\n\nShe played several roles at The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri, the largest outdoor theater in the U.S., including Fanny Brice in \"Funny Girl\" (1975), Charity in \"Sweet Charity\" (1977), and Lucille Early in \"No, No, Nanette\" (1990). Among her other musical theatre parts are the title role in \"Mame\" (2000 at the Helen Hayes Center for Performing Arts in Nyack, New York), Guenevere in \"Camelot\" (opposite husband Robert Goulet), \"Do I Hear a Waltz?\" at the Pasadena Playhouse (2001) and \"Follies\" at the Wadsworth Theatre in Los Angeles in 2002.\n\nHer television performances include a guest role in \"Breaking Point\" (as Evelyn Denner in the 1963 episode entitled \"There Are the Hip, and There Are the Square\"). \nIn October 1976, she appeared as the special guest on the popular weekly variety program \"The Bobby Vinton Show\", which aired across the United States and Canada. She performed \"Friend of the Father\". Other appearances include \"Rawhide\", \"Combat!\", \"Wagon Train\", \"The Fugitive\", \"The Big Valley\", \"Hawaii 5-0\", \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", \"Medical Center\", \"Kung Fu\", \"Mannix\", \"Murder She Wrote\", \"Saved by the Bell\", and \"Sex and the City\".\n\nIn 1992–93, she played the role of matriarch Angela Eckart on \"General Hospital\". She hosted five shows of \"Chef du Jour\" for the Food Network, cooking from \"I Remember Pasta\", her own cookbook, and setting a record for cookbook sales on the Home Shopping Network.\n\nIn 1999, she appeared in the television movie remake of Jason Miller's \"That Championship Season\" in a cameo role as Claire's mother (the mother-in-law of Vincent D'Onofrio's character), a role written into the film specifically for her. In 2013, she appeared Off-Broadway at the Westside Theatre Downstairs in Jason Odell Williams's play \"Handle with Care.\"\n\nLawrence has written her autobiography, with Phyllis Hobe, titled \"Carol Lawrence: The Backstage Story\", published in 1990.\n\n\nLawrence married three times:\n\nLawrence and Goulet married while both were Broadway stars; their romance was treated in the press like a fairy-tale. In her 1990 book, \"Carol Lawrence: The Backstage Story,\" she accused Goulet of alcoholism and an abusive husband and father.\n\nLawrence, a registered Democrat, accompanied Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman John Bailey, DNC Vice-Chairwoman Margaret B. Price, DNC Secretary Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush, Lena Horne, Richard Adler and Sidney Salomon on a visit with President John F. Kennedy at The White House on November 20, 1963; two days before his assassination.\n\nLawrence is Presbyterian and a member of the Bel Air Presbyterian Church.\n\n"}

{"id": "2218102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218102", "title": "Cycling Time Trials", "text": "Cycling Time Trials\n\nCycling Time Trials is the bicycle racing organisation which supervises individual and team time trials in England and Wales. It was formed out of predecessor body the Road Time Trials Council (RTTC) in 2002.\n\nA time trial tests a rider not against other cyclists but the watch. Other than in team events, which are less numerous, competitors race individually, starting at intervals of a minute or more. Riders may not ride together when one catches another. The order of start is often organised so that the fastest riders are spaced apart. In that way they are less likely to catch each other while, when they catch lesser riders, they will pass that much faster that neither will be helped or hindered.\n\nUK races can be organised over any distance but in practice they are most often run at standard distances of 10, 25, 50 and 100 miles with occasional races at 30 miles. The winner is the fastest over the course, routed so it finishes close to the start to lessen the effect of hills and wind. Longer events, lasting 12 or 24 hours are also held, the winner covering the greatest distance.\n\nThere are records at all distances, for riders on conventional bicycles, tandems and tricycles (and teams of individual riders, calculated on aggregate times or distances). There are championships for men, women, riders younger than 18, and competitions for veterans (riders aged 40 or more). The British Best All-Rounder competition, run by the RTTC since 1944, combines performances across three longer distance events.\n\nIn 1890, the National Cyclists' Union banned racing on UK public roads in fear of a ban not just on racing cyclists but all cycling. The legal position of cyclists was not secure. The cycling historian Bernard Thompson said: \"Events organised by clubs in the 1880s, although taking place on quiet country roads, were constantly interrupted by the police. Often horse-mounted policemen charged at racers and threw sticks into their wheels.\"\n\nThe NCU asked clubs to run races on closed tracks, known now as velodromes. But few existed and so rebel races began, under the influence of men such as Frederick Thomas Bidlake, to continue racing on the road but in a way they believed need not bring police attention. Riders would start at intervals, usually a minute, and race against the clock. Riders meeting on the road were not allowed to race against each other. Unsure of the legal situation, riders dressed from neck to ankle in black to make themselves less conspicuous, never wore numbers but always carried a bell. Races started in the countryside at dawn on courses referred to only in code. Even the cycling press was asked not to say where a race was taking place and details to competitors were headed \"private and confidential\" up to the 1960s.\n\nThere is dispute over which was the first race in this fashion but credit is usually given to the North Road Cycling Club of north London. It was held over 50 miles (approx 80 km) on 5 October 1895. Within two years, time trials had also been banned by the NCU, but events continued to be run secretly. Les Bowerman, who researched this and races that followed, said:\n\nWhat distinguished them from earlier unpaced races was that the riders started at intervals of two or three minutes in reverse handicap order, the fastest first. Company riding was not forbidden but was unlikely to occur. This would then be very similar to a time-trial as we know it.\n\nThe fact, as Bowerman says, that there were unpaced races against the clock before the North Road event in October 1895 means that the North Road club can not, as it often is, be described as the founder of time-trialling. Bernard Thompson, a historian of British time-trialling, wrote:\n\nNeither the Road Time Trials Council or the Road Racing Council before them can claim to have invented time-trialling. Without question, time-trials took place a century ago and the National Cyclists' Union national time-trial championship time-trials are recorded in 1878 when A. A. Weir was the victor with a time of 1m 27m 47s on a high ordinary. What the RRC did contribute was as great a measure as possible of uniformity in the conduct of road competitions.\n\nIn 1922 Bidlake formed the Road Racing Council – membership of which was restricted to members of the North Road, Bath Road, Anfield, Polytechnic, Kingsdale, Etna, Anerley, North London, Century, Unity and Midland cycling clubs. Each was already organising events on the road. The first meeting was at the offices of the Cyclists' Touring Club at 280 Euston Road, London on 27 June. The Road Racing Council did not make rules, making only recommendations which, because of its \"fundamental common-sense background\" clubs followed.\n\nAs the sport flourished during the 1930s, the council reviewed its constitution in 1937, opening membership to all clubs and changing its name to the Road Time Trials Council, RTTC. Its first recorded meeting was at the Devereau hotel in The Strand, London, on 16 November 1937. The first committee was Maurice Draisey (chairman), E. E. Stapley, E. F. Cash, W. S. Gibson, H. Parker, A. Shillito, Alec Glass, W. Frankum, A. Reeder, Bill Mills and Alex Josey. The rules were written by Glass, Josey, Mills and Draisey. The first general meeting, in spring 1938, resulted in its secretary, Stapley, being disqualified from re-election, even though \"he had worked like a slave to create the new body on thoroughly democratic lines.\" Clubs in Yorkshire then broke away, dissatisfied with the RTTC's national control, and set up their own regional body. It lasted only briefly.\n\nIn the RTTC's first year there were 429 races. In December the membership was 434 clubs, with a further 69 proposed. It sold 5,564 handbooks.\n\nAlthough started to thwart the NCU's ban on racing on the road, time-trialling acquired a respectability which not only led the NCU to recognise it but for time-trialling to become a cornerstone of British racing.\n\nHowever, British cycling split during the second world war when British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC) enthusiasts for massed racing on the open road organised a race from Llangollen to Wolverhampton against the rules of the NCU. The NCU banned those who organised and took part in it, and the RTTC, because it recognised the NCU's suspension, did the same.\n\n\"Like the NCU, the RTTC feared that massed racing would endanger the position of all cyclists. The RTTC's position, however, was hindered by its decision to stop all racing at the outbreak of war - a decision quickly changed - and to stop elections to its national committee until the war ended. The committee re-elected itself for four successive years.\"\n\nThe RTTC came to recognise that massed racing existed even if it did not approve, and other restrictions gradually relaxed: for example, clothing regulations became impracticable during fabric shortages in the second world war. But the RTTC continued to insist that races were run in secret. This led it to ban a proposed race from Paris to London in 1947. The NCU's ban on massed road racing meant the stage from Folkestone to London had to be a time trial, but the RTTC said advance reports about the race would be against its rules and refused to approve it. The sponsor, the \"News Chronicle\", refused to back a race it could not report was happening. Compromise was reached when the newspaper, the NCU and the RTTC agreed to say that a time trial stage would be held from Folkestone to London but they and the cycling press were obliged to keep the start and finish lines secret.\nIn 1951 the RTTC said, in a statement of around 3,500 words headed \"The Council's Statement on the Menace of Mass Start Racing on the Highway\":\n\nBunched racing is an utterly selfish and irresponsible use of roads; the policy of the Council is that all such racing should be stopped; the ringleaders and their associates of the BLRC have only financial gain as their motive; unsuspecting commercial concerns and newspapers have been given a distorted story about road racing; BLRC road races violate every one of the principles of clean amateurism, authenticity, and regard for public safety.\n\nA leader in the weekly magazine, \"The Bicycle\", called the statement \"sheer balderdash and offensive writing\" and \"a disgusting attack on the constitution, officials and members of the British League of Racing Cyclists, and of course, the repeated assurance that the RTTC can do no wrong.\"\n\nThe rivalry between the BLRC and the NCU continued until they merged in 1959 to form the British Cycling Federation (today British Cycling). The BCF accepted road racing, and controlled all competitive cycling other than time-trialling, which remained with the RTTC.\n\nEvents are no longer secret; lists of riders in major events are frequently published in the cycling press and on websites. Far from wearing black, riders are now urged to wear bright clothing to make themselves visible on busy roads. Early morning starts remain common, however, but for the benefit of light traffic rather than secrecy.\n\nIn 2002 Cycling Time Trials, a company limited by guarantee, was established as a corporate body for the RTTC.\n\nEach course has a code, for example Q10/25. In this case, the letter represents the district, the first number the course number and the second number the course distance in miles. In other districts, after the district letter, the code may be just a course number - for example, V212.\n\n"}

It is only one of the numerous \"ringlet\" butterflies in the tribe Satyrini.\n\nThe ringlet is a widely distributed species found throughout much of the Palearctic realm. In Europe it is common in most countries but absent from northern Scandinavia, peninsular Italy (found in northern Italy), Portugal, southern and central Spain (found in Cantabrian Mountains and the eastern Pyrenees), the Mediterranean islands and North Africa. In Greece it is found in northern regions (Macedonia, Thessaly). Beyond Europe it is found across much of temperate Asia including Russia, Siberia, Mongolia, China and Korea.\n\n\"Aphantopus hyperantus\" is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of up to 35 to 42 millimeters. The wing upper and lower sides are solid brown with small, yellowish-rimmed eyespots. The newly emerged ringlet has a velvety appearance and is almost black with a white fringe to the wings. The number and size of the eyespots is variable, they may be missing on the upper wing surface. In central Europe and southern England the rare form \"arete\" occurs. The eggs are pale yellow when first laid, but become pale brown.\n\nThe caterpillars are about 25 millimeters long. They are gray or light reddish brown and have dark, reddish brown and very fine dots. Dorsally there is a dark longitudinal line, which is widened at the segment boundaries. Toward the rear, this line is more intensely colored. The head is darker and has several faint longitudinal stripes.\n\n\nThey live in grassy, moist or dry forest clearings with bushes but not in open places. There is a strong degree of attachment to woodland edges and blackberry bushes. The insect can also be very common where there are creeping thistles (\"Cirsium arvense\") or swamp thistles (\"Cirsium palustre\"), oregano (\"Origanum vulgare\"), forest scabious (\"Knautia sylvatica\"), or hogweed (\"Heracleum sphondylium\") which are favorite food plants of the imagos. The males fly in search of newly hatched females in slow, uninterrupted flight and flutter round, about and between grass stems.\n\nA single brood butterfly, the imagines fly from mid-June to late August.\n\nThe caterpillars feed on many grasses. Among the food plants are:\n\nThe female scatters non-adhesive eggs in a slow low flight over grasslands. The larva is nocturnal. There are four moults. The larva hibernates while in the third instar, breaking diapause to feed on warm winter evenings. Feeding resumes in the spring. The pupa stands generally upright in a flimsy silk cocoon, at the base of a grass tussock. This stage lasts for two weeks. \"A. hyperantus\" is generally considered to have a closed population structure since it occurs in small, well-defined populations.\n\nHyperantus, of Greek mythology, was one of the 50 sons of Aegyptus, killed by one of the 50 daughters of Danaus.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2218149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218149", "title": "King Midget", "text": "King Midget\n\nThe King Midget was a micro car produced between 1946 and 1970 by the Midget Motors Corporation. Although the company started out by offering a kit to build the car, they soon added completely-assembled cars and later only offered completed cars. Company founders Claud Dry and Dale Orcutt first sold the King Midget as part of their Midget Motors Supply operations in Athens, Ohio. By 1948, they began to use the name Midget Motors Manufacturing Co., too. In about 1956, Dry and Orcutt changed the name of their company to Midget Motors Corporation.\n\nMidget Motors' primary methods of advertising their cars were through small advertisements in popular magazines that appealed to home mechanics. The ads were tiny but effective; they showed a midget car and some earlier ads contained the phrase \"500 lb. car for $500.00\" The ads brought in a steady stream of interested customers. Some of the magazines featured articles about the car and several pictured the car on their front cover. This method of direct selling continued for most of the life of the company.\n\nThe first generation King Midget was a single-passenger kit designed to resemble a midget racer. The kit included the chassis, axles, steering assembly, springs, instruction manual, plus dimensioned patterns for the sheet metal, all for a cost of $270.00. It would accept any one-cylinder engine. By 1947, the Model 1 was also available in assembled form, powered by a 6 hp (4.5 kW) Wisconsin engine. Since adding a differential would have increased the cost, the car was driven by the right rear wheel only. It used a centrifugal clutch designed by Orcutt. The pair began to develop a two-passenger micro car in 1947. In total, nine separate prototypes were built until the designers met their goals of simplicity, lightness, and economy. The result was the Model 2.\n\nWhen it appeared on the cover of \"Popular Science\" magazine in 1951, the Model 2 was a two-passenger convertible offered either fully assembled or as a kit, powered by a 7.5 hp (5.6 kW) sidevalve Wisconsin AENL engine. With a wheelbase ( less than a Crosley 4CC), it measured only overall. The Model 2 was still a very basic car; it had no speedometer or reverse, but it was light, strong, and available for just $500. In 1955, a custom model of the Model 2 was introduced. It lasted through 1957, with the price remaining under $550. By contrast, a four-passenger 1952 Crosley CD sedan could be had, fully assembled, for $943, and a wagon as low as $1002. Soon after the Model 2 was in production, the company began to offer the option of a two-speed automatic transmission that included a reverse. This transmission, developed and patented by Orcutt and Dry, was soon to be included as standard equipment and was used on all subsequent models.\n\nIn the 1950s, Midget Motors developed the Junior and Trainer. Both designs were tube-framed motorized four-wheelers that were forerunners of the go-karts and all-terrain vehicles that were to become popular later. The Junior was powered by a 2.5 hp (1.9 kW) Briggs & Stratton engine, while the Trainer used a 3 hp (2.2 kW) Briggs and Stratton. Both had an automatic clutch with a geared, reverse transmission in the drive train. They were discontinued in the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1957, the Model 3 was introduced. On a new, wheelbase, and now measuring overall, it was still smaller than a Crosley. It now had four-wheel hydraulic brakes and was powered by a 9.2 hp (6.9 kW) Wisconsin single cylinder engine. The unit-body, which was welded for increased strength, was continued throughout to the end of production. The 1958 price approached $900. (The much bigger Rambler American started at $1775.) In 1966 more power was added when the company switched to a 12 hp {8.9 kW} Kohler engine, and also converted the car to a 12-volt electrical system. Midget production lasted through the 1960s, and eventually almost 5,000 were built.\n\nAlthough the founders had maintained their independence, by the 1960s they were approaching retirement age. In 1966 they accepted a buy-out offer from a group backed by investment bankers and the owners retired, remaining as consultants. Over the years they had remained profitable by carefully matching their production to sales. They had produced a unique car of their own design and constantly introduced improvements and refined their design. The new owners had a different vision; they vastly increased production but the anticipated increased sales did not follow. By 1969 the company was forced into bankruptcy. Production manager Vernon Eads bought the remains of Midget Motors under the name Barthman Corporation. He created plans for a new model, the Commuter, a one-piece fiberglass car that resembled a dune buggy. A fire at his newly-built Florida plant destroyed the only body mold. The 1970 run was 15 cars, including the only three Commuters ever built. The costs of rebuilding after the fire, combined with new safety and emissions standards, were more than Eads could bear, and he closed the company in 1970.\nToday, more information about the King Midget is made available by members of the King Midget Car Club, which offers books on the history of the cars, an annual gathering of fans and owners, and information about spare parts, repairs, vendors, and restoration. In recent years, an increased appreciation has developed about the qualities of the King Midget's efficient use of materials, fuel economy, ruggedness, and ease of repair.\n\n King Midget is a U.S. Registered trademark, mark number 5,019,249 owned by Stephen V. Weaver Jr.\n\n\n"}

He has worked on feature film tie-in comics such as \"Star Wars: General Grievous\" and \"Superman Returns Prequel\" #3.\n\nRick Leonardi was born August 9, 1957 in Philadelphia, and grew up in Haverhill, Massachusetts. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1979 and started drawing for Marvel Comics the following year.\n\nRick Leonardi's first published comics artwork appeared in \"Thor\" #303 (Jan. 1981). He collaborated with writer Bill Mantlo on two limited series: \"The Vision and the Scarlet Witch\" (Nov. 1982–Feb. 1983) and \"Cloak and Dagger\" (Oct. 1983–Jan. 1984). Leonardi's works in the 1980s include various fill-in issues of \"The Uncanny X-Men \" and \"The New Mutants\".\n\nHe is credited, along with fellow illustrator Mike Zeck, of designing the black-and-white costume to which Spider-Man switched during the 1984 \"Secret Wars\" miniseries, and later wore for a time. According to writer Peter David, the costume began as a design by Zeck that Leonardi embellished. The plot that developed as a result of Spider-Man's acquisition of the costume led to the creation of the Spider-Man villain known as Venom although in a 2007 Comic Book Resources story, fan Randy Schueller claims to have devised a version of a black costume for Spider-Man in a story idea that he was paid for. Leonardi and writer Tom DeFalco created the Rose in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #253 (June 1984). For DC Comics, Leonardi was one of the artists on \"Batman\" #400 (Oct. 1986) and he drew the Batgirl story in \"Secret Origins\" vol. 2 #20 (Nov. 1987). Back at Marvel, Chris Claremont and Leonardi introduced the fictional country of Genosha in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #235 (Oct. 1988). From 1992 to 1994, Leonardi was the regular penciler for the first 25 issues of \"Spider-Man 2099\" with writer Peter David. Leonardi later launched the \"Fantastic Four 2099\" series with Karl Kesel. Leonardi drew the 2000 intercompany crossover miniseries \"Green Lantern Versus Aliens\". He drew one of the tie-in one-shots for the \"Sentry\" limited series in 2001.\n\nHis subsequent series work includes \"Nightwing\", on which he was the regular penciler for issues #71-84 from 2002 to 2003 and \"Batgirl\", of which he drew issues #45–52 from 2003 to 2004. Subsequent miniseries he drew include \"Star Wars: General Grievous\" in 2005, and the 2006 movie tie-in, \"Superman Returns Prequel\" #3. He followed up that with other superhero titles such as \"Superman\" #665 and #668 (2007), \"\" #43 (November 2007), \"Witchblade\" #112 (January 2008), and the 2008 miniseries \"DC Universe: Decisions\". Leonardi drew the \"Vigilante\" series that debuted from DC in December 2008.\n\nLeonardi and inker Ande Parks are the illustrators on the 2019 \"Batman Beyond\" arc written by Dan Jurgens which debuted with issue #31 in April 2019. Although Leonardi had worked on Batman before, this assignment is his first time working on the future-based Batman Beyond, whose concept is similar to \"Spider-Man 2099\", which Leonardi co-created.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Established in 1905 through a grant given by the American business magnate, industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller under the auspices of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, it is the first Baptist founded and second American university in the Philippines and Asia (after Silliman University (1901) in Dumaguete).\nIt initially consisted of three separate schools: the \"Jaro Industrial School\" for boys and the \"Bible School\" that trains Christian ministers and workers which both established by the American missionary William Orison Valentine, and the \"Baptist Missionary Training School\" for training of women religious workers and missionaries.\n\nIn 1913, women began to be admitted to the school for boys, and in 1920 the school started offering high school education. The school for boys became a junior college and started offering college degrees in 1923 which includes its merger with the Bible School that became its organic unit as its theology department, and it changed its name to Central Philippine College. In 1936 the junior college became a senior college and two years after it in 1938, the Baptist Missionary Training School for women merged with the theology department of the college. In 1953, the college attained university status.\n\nIloilo Mission Hospital, the university's hospital which was established in 1901 by the Presbyterian Americans, is the first American and Protestant founded hospital in the Philippines which predates the founding of CPU by four years.\n<ref name=\"http://iloilocity.org/history.html\">America and Protestantism in the Philippines. Retrieved 4 May 2014.</ref>\n\nCentral pioneered nursing education in the Philippines, when Presbyterian American missionaries established the Union Mission Hospital Training School for Nurses in 1906. In the same year, the CPU Republic (Central Philippine University Republic), the university's official student governing body, was organized, making it as the first established student governing body in South East Asia. Central was also the first institution to pioneer the work-study program in the country that was later patterned and followed by other institutions.\n\nThe university maintains to be non-sectarian and independent but affiliated with the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches and maintains fraternal ties with the International Ministries of the American Baptist Churches, known before as the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society.\n\nCPU consists of eighteen schools and colleges that provides instruction in basic education all the way up to the post-graduate levels. In the undergraduate and graduate levels, its disciplines include accountancy, agriculture, arts and sciences, business, computer studies, education, engineering, hospitality management, law, mass communication, medical laboratory science, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, lifestyle and fitness, real estate management, rehabilitative science, tourism, and theology.\n\nThe Commission on Higher Education (CHED Philippines) has granted the university a full autonomous status. It is also the same government agency that awarded Central as Centers of Excellence in Business Administration and Agriculture and Centers of Development in Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering and Teacher Education\n. The Department of Science and Technology (Philippines) has designated the university's College of Engineering both as (DOST) Department of Science and Technology School and Center for Civil Engineering Education for Western Visayas region.\n\nCentral is a registered National Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines and a Philippine Registered Cultural Property by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. The university has been designated as the Regional Art Center (or Kaisa sa Sining Regional Art Center) by the Cultural Center of the Philippines\n\nIt has also been certified as one of the few ISO certified educational institutions in the Philippines by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The Board of International Ministries of the American Baptist Churches likewise on the other hand, has awarded Central a School of Excellence award.\n\nInternational collaborations and linkages with foreign institutions has earmarked CPU to offer undergraduate, graduate and doctorate overseas programs in Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese universities. A fine result of it include when the university opened an overseas academic programs jointly with the Thai Nguyen University (TNU) and Thai Nguyen University of Economics and Business Administration (TUEBA) both in Vietnam.\n\nCPU alumni and associated people have been recognized in the wide range of fields. Some of them became pioneer in their distinctions. It include National Artists of the Philippines, laureates of Ramon Magsaysay Award (Asian equivalent of Nobel Prize) and Rolex Award, Senators, Presidential cabinet members, United Nations Consul General, Associate and Chief Justices of the Court of Appeals of the Philippines and Supreme Court of the Philippines, first female General in the Armed Forces of the Philippines, first female General in the Philippine Army, Public Servants, Congressmen (Legislators), and notable Business tycoons.\n\nIn the early 20th century when the Philippines was opened to the American Protestant missionaries prior and after the Philippines was ceded by Spain to the United States through the 1898 Treaty of Paris after the Spanish–American War, a comity agreement by the Protestant American churches was established that the Philippine islands will be divided into mission territories, thus the Western Visayan region went to the jurisdiction of the Baptists.\n\nThe origins of Central Philippine University dates back in 1901 when the American Northern Baptists, through its foreign mission board, the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, laid a plan to establish mission schools following the comity agreement of the division of the islands for the evangelical mission and through a benevolent grant given by John D. Rockefeller, an American industrialist and philanthropist. John D. Rockefeller himself was a devoted Northern Baptist with numerous church related philanthropy works throughout his life, that is why he gave a grant to the Northern Baptists that resulted in the establishment of Central.\nOn the other hand, in 1901 also, four years before the founding of Central in 1905, alongside when the American Baptists came in Iloilo, the Presbyterians came and they established the Union Mission Hospital (where Central, since its founding until to this day is closely associated with) under the Presbyterian Church in America by Joseph Andrew Hall as the first Protestant and American hospital in the islands. Since the hospital's founding, Presbyterians had worked hand in hand with the Baptists for the operation of the hospital. The hospital was later renamed to Union Hospital and later to its present name, Iloilo Mission Hospital. Following the years since its founding, in 1925, its administration was eventually transferred to the Baptists who also bought the land in the City of Jaro (now part and a district of Iloilo City) where the hospital now stands. The hospital predates the schools founding by four years. It also serves since then as the hospital of Central. The hospital pioneered the Nursing education in the Philippines when it established the Union Mission Hospital Training School for Nurses (the present Central Philippine University College of Nursing) in 1906. The school also produced the first graduate nurses in the country.\n\nThen in 1903, there will be two schools that will be established by the mission: an industrial school for boys and a Bible school to train pastors and other Christian workers was incorporated. Later, it was voted on 2 December 1904 to finally establish the both schools. The task to found both schools was given to William O. Valentine, an American missionary, who became the first principal and president with the help of the other co-founders. Valentine was in the service of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, where he first ministered as a missionary in Burma, first in Rangoon, then in Mandalay, where he became the principal of the Baptist Mission High School for Boys in 1895. The new mission was given to him by the mission society in 1903. During his eighth year in Burma he suffered severe sunstroke and returned to America for treatment. There he met his future wife, nurse Ina Jane Van Allen. Valentine and Van Allen were married in 1903 and the couple left for his new appointment in Iloilo in the Philippines.\n\nThe establishment of the Baptist Missionary Training School and the Jaro Industrial School is associated with the first Baptist Church in the Philippine Islands, the Jaro Evangelical Church, which was established in 1900 by the Northern American Baptists also, now the American Baptist Churches. In June 1905, the Baptist Missionary Training School opened in the home of the Valentines, under the auspices of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society from the United States alongside with other missionaries that are considered as co-founders. There were 12 pupils with some \"Bible Women\" who attended as auditors.\n\nThe benevolent grant given by the industrialist and oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, was used to provide the school the facilities during the school's establishment along with the industrial school (which was later established in the fall of 1905) and to purchase a 24-hectare piece of land in the City of Jaro (now a part of Iloilo City) where Central's main campus is located at present.\n\nIn the fall of 1905, the Jaro Industrial School was opened as a free vocational boarding school for poor boys. The first class consisted of 20 boys who worked four hours a day to pay their tuition, room and board, and spent four hours in the classroom. One of the school's innovations was the adoption of student self-government, the first in the South East Asia, known today as Central Philippine University Republic, which is modeled on American civil government. Dr. William Orison Valentine, worked for its incorporation and recognition by the Philippine Government. A year later when Jaro Industrial School was established, one of the school's innovations was the adoption of student self-government which is modeled on American civil government, the Jaro Industrial School Republic. The Republic continues to this day as the Central Philippine University Republic. It still holds the distinction as the oldest student governing body in South East Asia. The original purpose of the founding of the industrial school for boys was quoted a century later in 2005 during the centennial celebrations of the university:\n\n\"\"The original purpose of the school\" (Jaro Industrial School) \"was to provide opportunity for poor Filipino boys to receive a good Christian education by working their way through school. Actual work experience and earnest study of the Bible were the core of the curriculum.\"\"\n\nLater the leadership of the Bible School was turned over to the Rev. Henry Munger, who conducted classes off campus. In 1907, Reverend William Valentine became and tenured again as head of the Jaro Industrial School. By 1907 during his term, there were 300 boys working an active farm and in various trades. All of this students were required to live on campus. In 1907 also, the Bible School split off under a separate principal, Dr. Eric Lund. Classes were held at the Mission Press building where Lund was doing his Scripture translation work.\n\nIn 1910, independent student media at the Jaro Industrial School created the first official student publication, The Hoe (the present Central Echo). It is now one of the oldest student publications in the Philippines.\n\nIn 1912, Dr. Lund left the Baptist Missionary Training School and it was closed. Following that year, in 1913, Dr. Valentine's objectives were realized and in the same year the Jaro Industrial School also admitted its first female student; it was fully incorporated then by the Philippine government and enrolled 740 students. Then in 1915, Jaro Industrial School opened its first high school program, starting with first and second year classes, adding third and fourth year classes in 1920. As the both two schools were founded by the Northern American Baptists from the American Baptist Churches, ordination for women is affirmed that resulted and eventually in 1917, the Jaro Industrial School elected its \"first female head and Principal\", Mary J. Thomas, who tenured as a Principal of the Jaro Industrial School from 1917 to 1918. The Baptist Missionary Training School later however was reopened in 1913 by Rev. Alton Bigelow. It was under Rev. Alton Bigelow's leadership that the Bible School began to have a definite direction in its development. In 1921, the following year after the Jaro Industrial School added fourth year high school classes, the school graduated its first high school batch.\n\nThe first Board of Trustees which was formed a year earlier before the founding of the two schools, is composed of five members from the mission conference which are selected by the mission conference in annual session. They remained American in composition until prior to the conversion of the Jaro Industrial School as a junior college. In the early years of the school's operation, building up qualified faculty and staff had been a great challenge. Some missionaries gave part-time service and Dr. David S. Hibbard, founder of the Silliman Institute, now Silliman University, also provided Filipino instructors who had trained at Silliman Institute.\n\nTo accommodate the need for tertiary education in the area, a junior college was opened in 1923 and the name of the school was changed to Central Philippine College. In April of the following year, the Baptist Missionary Training School became an organic part of the junior College. The senior college opened in 1936 and by 1940 five degrees were offered: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Education, Bachelor of Theology and Bachelor of Religious Education.\n\nWhen the junior college became a senior college in 1936, the College of Engineering was also established.\n\nIn 1938, Baptist Missionary Training School (BMST) for women which was established independently on October 20, 1905, became part of the theology department of the college. In the same year also, students and interested sectors of the school began to press for the opening of a law school. Finally, on 18 March 1939, the Board of Trustees voted to apply for a permit to offer the first two years of the law course. It opened in the school year 1939–1940. Attorney Pablo Oro, who had been one of the leaders in urging this move and in seeking patrons to help develop the law library, was given the responsibility for developing the program. Pablo Oro, a member of the Philippine Bar, was a graduate of Silliman University and of the University of Manila College of Law.\n\nOn September 19, 1931, the Union Mission Hospital started admitting and treating patients in its present location on Mission Road. The hospital plant occupied a lot 29,283 meters or approximately 3 hectares in area. On October 21, 1931 became a joyous day. The new relocated hospital was dedicated with its founder, Dr. Joseph Andrew Hall came all the way from Tacloban City, Leyte, as the guest of honor on the said momentous occasion. Dr. Precy Grigg lost no time in developing the new hospital's buildings and its surroundings. On what used to be a deep rice field and swampy place was a green lawn and rose garden surrounding the new imposing and neat-looking concrete hospital. After office hours, Dr. Grigg loved to work on landscaping the surroundings with plants secured from the islands of Negros and Panay.\n\nOn March 5, 1932, Union Mission Hospital (UMH) became the Iloilo Mission Hospital (IMH). Likewise the training school was renamed Iloilo Mission Hospital Training School for Nurses (IMHTSN). The hospital onwards continued to grow. It drew students from many parts of the Philippine islands who came to apply for admission to the training school for nurses.\n\n \nAcademic life in the campus was interrupted when invading Japanese forces landed in Iloilo. As a consequence of the invasion, missionaries assigned at Central fled and took refuge in the mountain barrios of Katipunan, Tapaz, Capiz. They hid in the forest they called \"Hopevale\" with the help of their Filipino friends. They were eventually captured by the Japanese troops on December 19, 1943. The missionaries begged them to free the Filipino captives and instead offered themselves as ransom. At the dawn of December 20, 1943, the missionaries asked to be allowed to pray and, an hour later, they told their Japanese captors they were ready to die. The adults were beheaded and the children were bayoneted.\n\nThe missionaries who died in the massacre are today called the Hopevale Martyrs. The martyrs are: Dr. Francis Howard Rose (former President and head of Central), Jeanie Clare Adams, Prof. James Howard Clovell, Charma Moore Clovell, Dorothy Antoinette Dowell, Signe Amelia Erikson, Dr. Frederick Willer-Meyer, Ruth Schatch Meyer, Gertrude Coombs Rose, Rev. Erle Frederich Rounds, Louise Cummings Rounds, and Erle Douglas. Despite the order that these Americans should go home because of the war, they refused to leave their mission and eventually sacrificed their lives.\n\nAfter the war ended, the college was reopened by the remaining members of the faculty and by returning missionaries. When the Second World War broke out, the college's buildings were destroyed. Reconstruction was made possible through funds from friends at home and abroad.\n\nThe college's Graduate School was formally opened in 1951 with Dr. Linnea A. Nelson as dean. Dr. Nelson, holder of an Ed.D degree from the University of California, Berkeley, had been a missionary in China from 1935 to 1949. Since its founding, the graduate school has been chosen by the fund for Assistance to Private Education (FAPE) as a graduate center for MBA, MA in English and Master of Engineering for the following fields of specialization: civil engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.\n\nWhen the war ended, Dr. Henry S. Waters, the postwar director of Iloilo Mission Hospital and also principal of the Iloilo Mission Hospital School of Nursing in 1946–1947, pressed for the offering, with Central Philippine College (the forerunner of Central Philippine University), a collegiate course leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree. The director of the Bureau of Private Schools and the members of the board of examiners for nurses authorized the opening of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing four-year course in 1947 that resulted the school's operation transferred to the College.\n\nDr. Waters served as acting dean of the new College of Nursing at Central Philippine College (1947–1948). When he returned to the United States, Dr. Teofilo Marte served as the executive secretary (1948–1949). Loreto D. Tupaz, who finished her Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree at CPU, was the acting dean from 1949 to 1950 and served in this capacity until the arrival of Esther Salzman, Master of Science in Nursing and an American Baptist Foreign Mission Society missionary nurse, who held the deanship from 1950 to 1961. During her term, the college offered three curricular programs: the Bachelor of Science in Nursing four-year course, the GN-Bachelor of Science in Nursing Supplemental Course and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing five-year course.\n\nTupaz and Salzman worked together to develop Central Philippine College of Nursing (later the Central Philippine University College of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences) into a college of distinction, recognized both in the Philippines and abroad. Salzman served as dean until 1961 when she retired in the United States. Lily Plagata, MSN, was appointed to the deanship (1961–1974). When she resigned and went abroad, she was replaced by Carmen Centeno, Master of Science, for the remaining months of 1963. Centeno, however, also left for the United States, and Loreto D. Tupaz, who finished her MA degree at CPU, resumed the deanship (1963–1970), assisted by Maria Pablico, MSN (1969–1970). Pablico also resigned to work in the United States from 1963–1973. Tupaz continued to administer the three course programs of the college, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing five-year course, the CCT (Clinical Teaching) course, and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Supplemental Course.\n\nOn 1 April 1953, the college gained government recognition and was given a university charter, converting the college into what is now known as the Central Philippine University.\n\nIn July 1955, the Hon. Robert Simmons, the former Chief Justice of the Nebraska State Court, visited the campus and lectured to the students. He became very much interested in the former law school Dean Atty. Pablo Oro and the College of Law. Justice Simmons gave generous support to the law school's library and encouraged his friends and colleagues to do the same.\n\nIn 1965, Central's College of Engineering offered a one-year Sanitary engineering course with three graduates. One could only enroll in this course after completing the Civil Engineering course. However, this restriction was abolished later due to an insufficient number of enrollees. In 1956, after three years when the college received a university charter from the Philippine government, the first female President, Linnea A. Nelson, was elected.\n\nOn the other hand, Linnea Nelson became the first female university president, she was the person behind the establishment of the School of Graduate Studies back in 1951, where she was the first dean of the school. Nelson is an Ed.D degree holder from the University of California, Berkeley, and had been a missionary in China from 1935 to 1949. She served as the president of Central from 1956–1957 and was again re-elected in 1965–1966.\n\nFrom its founding, Filipinos were gradually given larger responsibilities in its administration. In 1966 the first Filipino president, Dr. Rex D. Drilon, a CPU alumnus and a Political Scientist from the University of the Philippines Diliman, was elected. Dr. Drilon began initiatives for the Filipinization of the university, and made a trip to the United States for the purpose. The American Baptist Foreign Mission Society consented to transfer the multi-million University properties to the Filipinos in consonance with the Foreign Mission policy of \"Americans receding and Filipinos advancing\". Thus, in 1968 the entire university property – land, buildings, and equipment – was turned over by the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society to the Filipino corporation of CPU. Since 1973, all members of the Board of Trustees and administrative officials of the university have been Filipinos.\n\nIn 1998 until 2008, the 3rd Filipino president of the university, Dr. Juanito Acanto term was dubbed as \"Years of Bliss: Years of Fulfillment\", where academic and infrastructural developments flourished in the university, through help from the alumni. It was in his term also, when the university started a goal to raise 100 million Php and as planned, the campaign started in September 2001 until December 2005. The CPU Centennial Development Fund alone raised a total of 75,000,000 pesos from 182 Endowment programs. The helpful endeavor through other endowment fund programs, which started years back, was intensified and is still ongoing, with a total of 433 Endowment Funds, amounting to 127,500,000 pesos until May of his last year term as the university president in 2007; celebrated its centennial year in 2005, where thousands of alumni from the world came home. The university's centennial celebration and followed by the foundation day on 1 October owes a lot to the American founders and missionaries who founded and sacrificed for Central, especially to the Reverend William Valentine, the founding father of the institution.\n\nIloilo Mission Hospital, the university hospital of Central in 2001, celebrated its centennial, commemorating its century of existence and its contribution since its founding in 1901 to the Philippine and American colonial history in the Philippines and in Asia as it pioneered the Nursing education in the Philippines, as the \"first Protestant founded hospital in the country\" and the \"second American hospital in Asia\". The centennial building was inaugurated in the hospital area proper and the hospital acquisition of the Philips MX8000 CT Scan machine, the \"first of its kind in South East Asia\"\n\nAugmented amounts from the Centennial Development Fund and the help of various individuals, was used to build and expand the various structures on the main campus, such as the Dr. Alfonso A. Uy – Student Union Building, a four-storey commercial building built through the fund and by Dr. Alfonso A. Uy (an alumnus of the University) on the campus, to help augment its operational expenses, and to further raise its financial base; CPU Lifestyle Learning Center (prior to the students and the people who wanted to manage their fitness lifestyle); and the CPU Alumni Promenade and Concert Park, which is structurally attached to the also newly built CPU Alumni Center, CPU Alumni Affairs Office, Educational Media Center (where the CPU TV Channel and Radio broadcasts still to this day) and the CPU Dining Hall, and the CPU Excel Center.\n\nAlso, in the school year 2000–2001, the Central Philippine University College of Engineering introduced the \"Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering\". This has earned the College another place in \"Engineering History in the Philippines\". It is the first engineering school in the country to offer the course. On 15 August 2001 also, Dr. Ted Robles (BSEE 1964) (the present university president) and a former Milwaukee School of Engineering professor conducted a national seminar on a digital logic software known as the \"Altera Max + Plus II\" which was attended by different engineering schools in the Philippines and hosted by the Electrical Engineering and Electronics and Communications Engineering department of Central Philippine University College of Engineering.\n\nThe College of Engineering hosted the first-ever National Congress on Civil Engineering. Then, a seminar workshop was held featuring Dr. Stephen Agunlana from Asian Institute of Technology as guest professor. This was followed by the two more Civil Engineering Seminars, this time featuring alumni, namely, Asian Institute of Technology based Engr. Henry Abiera (College Alumnus) on \"Geotechnical engineering\", and Engr. Vicente Golveo (BSCE 1957) from the United States of America on \"Structural Engineering\". Seminars on Instrumentation and Micro Controllers were undertaken with Dr. Teodoro Robles (College of Alumnus and present university president), also from the United States of America, as resource person.\n\nOne of the other prominent infrastructural developments during Dr. Juanito Acanto's term as a president, is the establishment of the university's own Television Channel, the \"CPU TV Channel\". The television channel, launched in 2001 under its former names, EXCEL TV, then was changed to CPU Alumni Channel in 2005, and to \"CPU TV Channel\", is the \"first university–based cable TV channel in Asia\", is one big leap in upholding the university's standard in quality education through the use of mass media. There were various new real properties also that is owned by the University when he was in his term as the President. The 24 hectares San Rafael Agricultural Land and the 14 hectare Guimaras Agricultural Land\n\nCentral gained much attention and was lauded by various business and technology sectors in the field of Engineering, through its pioneer Packaging Engineering program and department in the College of Engineering, being the first such in the country and in Asia, organized and hosted the first National Conference in Transport Packaging in 2007 it was then followed also by the first Philippine International Packaging Conference, the Global Pack 2012. Thomas Schneider, President and CEO of the 51-member nation World Packaging Organization, is one of the delegates of the Global Pack 2012 event alongside with various persons from other countries, government agencies and business sector. Alongside with the Global Pack 2012 conference, a packaging engineering testing center and laboratory and value-added facility of a UN-compliant and comprehensive was donated by \"US Packaging Hall of Famer\" and \"Department of Science and Technology (DOST-Philippines) Balik Scientist\" Dr. Lejo Brana, is also the first of its kind in the Southeast Asian region, the CPU Philippine Center for Packaging Engineering and Technology (CPU-PC PET). The Center is backed by the Philippine- Department of Science and Technology, the industry's Packaging Institute of the Philippines and a private sector's packaging advocate, Systemat-PackEDGE.\n\nThe University currently expanded its numbers of programs in business, agriculture, and medical and health sciences and the recent re-establishment of the pharmacy department. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), prior to the University as an ISO Certified Institution, recently conducted an external audit and surveillance for the University's renewal of ISO certification, based on the new standard. The University last upgraded its certification last 2010. The said University's certification, covers educational and support which is up to year 2013. Recently, through international collaborations with other institutions has made CPU to offer undergraduate programs in Business Administration and Accountancy, graduate programs in Business Administration and Public Administration, and doctorate degree in Management program at Thai Nguyen University (TNU) and Thai Nguyen University of Economics and Business Administration (TUEBA) both in Vietnam.\n\nThe university acquired also a Level IV accreditation status (the highest level of accreditation that could be given to an individual academic program in the Philippines) from Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities (ACSCU) in the programs of Business Administration, Accountancy and Education, among others, has made it the top university in the Western Visayan region with programs that has a said accreditation status and level. It ranks first in the Philippines in terms of tertiary academic programs with Level III level status. The university also ranks first among other universities based on Centers of Development and Excellence list in Western Visayas, where six of its programs designated by the Commission on Higher Education (Philippines) as Centers of Development and Center of Excellence, while Department of Science and Technology (Philippines) designated its Civil Engineering program as Center for Civil Engineering Education. Central is one of the two leaders in the Visayas and Mindanao based on endowment funding, with 182 Endowment programs and a total of 433 Endowment funds in 2007 that is still on-going and expanding still to this day.\n\nThe CPU's main campus sits on a 24 hectare (59.30 acres) of land in the former city of Jaro which is now a district of Iloilo City. The main campus's essential location is laid back and urban yet away from the distraction of the progressive bustling city center and metropolis of Iloilo, which has been dubbed as the \"Asia's City of Love\" or \"City of Love\" and \"Emerging Museum City of the Philippines\". Iloilo City is the last capital of Spanish Empire in Asia and the Pacific hence the Spanish influence could be seen elsewhere especially in culture, but during the onset years of university's founding, it had been quite a struggle but it carried thoroughly with the help and auspices of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society. Central was established and the grant that was given by the American industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller was vital in purchasing a piece of land that the present main campus now stands. The main campus is a veritable community by itself dotted by Acacia and Palm trees with more than 30 buildings that dates back in the early years of Central's founding. The main campus plan follows a typical American university and is flanked by various gates. The second gate is the main entrance and bears the University's motto, \"Scientia et Fides\" which in English means \"Knowledge and Faith\". Central is a registered National historical landmark by the Philippine government cultural agency of National Historical Commission of the Philippines.\n\nSome buildings on the main campus dates back during the early American occupation of the Philippines and characterizes American colonial architecture. Central has been declared by the local government unit of Iloilo City as \"Tourist site\" and is the only university in the Western Visayas region recommended for tourists as a place of interest, attraction and landmark to visit by the largest travel site in the world, the Trip Advisor. Central has been also hailed as the second of all the 18 beautiful college campuses in the Philippines by an American internet media company BuzzFeed.<ref name=\"TRENDING: 18 Most Beautiful College/University campus in the Philippines!!\">TRENDING: 18 Most Beautiful College/University campus in the Philippines!!. Retrieved 12-24-2015.</ref>\n\nBy order, the University Church is the tallest building on the main campus and meant by the planners as a \"central and dominant feature\" of the main campus proper. The church is notable noted for its Indonesian or Malay design and is a famous landmark in Iloilo City. Henry Luce III Library is one of the largest libraries in the Philippines with more than a quartered of a million volume holdings. Inside the Henry Luce III Library is the Meyer Asian Collection holdings of artifacts and other museum and art exhibitions.\n\nOther buildings on the main campus include the famous Rose Memorial Auditorium or \"Rose\". Rose was built to replace the old Rose Memorial Hall which was burned down by fire in 1991. The Rose Memorial Auditorium is the largest theater in Western Visayas and has been a famous venue for different international and local kinds of musical and band concerts and conventions in Iloilo. Rose was the first annual venue of the prestigious national Bombo Music Festival when during its early years since it was established. Recently, the Cultural Center of the Philippines has designated the Rose Memorial Auditorium for three-year Memorandum of Understanding, as one of the first batch of nine Cultural Center of the Philippines Regional Art Centers or Kaisa sa Sining Regional Art Centers in 2014, which is the only one in Western Visayas region.<ref name=\"Kaisa sa Sining: The CCP Regional Art Centers & University/College Art Associates\">Kaisa sa Sining: The CCP Regional Art Centers & University/College Art Associates .

Its residents are students of the College of Theology.\n\nThe Roblee Science Hall, serves as a laboratory building, where science and laboratory experiments classes are held by the Colleges and departments of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Pharmacy, and Chemistry (also, General subjects of other Colleges held classes in Roblee Science Hall). Valentine Hall, is a monument to Central's founder, William Valentine, a Baptist missionary. It now houses the Colleges of Education and Arts and Sciences of the university\n\nCPU's main campus is enhanced by parks, gazebos, gardens and open spaces, including the Big Field, Half Moon, Alumni Garden, Santos Park, Nuñez Centennial Garden, Caipang Tree Park, Rex A. Drilon Millenium Park, the Glen at the Catedral, the Prayer Garden, the CPU-CAS Butterfly Garden, and the University Botanical Garden.\n\nThe main campus as a locally declared tourism site, the university maintains a team of landscapers and gardeners. Annually, the university showcases the \"Festival of Lights and Music at Central\", a joint project of the university and the CPU Alumni Association. The event features lighted figurines, trees and buildings, nativity scenes, and colorful lanterns attracting thousands of local and foreign tourists during the Christmas season. The Opening of Lights (Festival of Lights and Music at Central) remains one of the notable features of the CPU campus. It opens in first week of December and is highlighted with a fireworks display on the opening ceremony. Lighted trees, buildings and figurines, Pampanga, Capiz shells and native lanterns placed along the major campus roads and nativity scenes add to its festive atmosphere.\n\nThe CPU Farm (in the municipality of Zarraga, Iloilo) under the Central's College of Agriculture, Resources and Environmental Sciences is separate from the university's main campus, where the CPU Crop Research Laboratory and other agricultural research facilities and equipments of the college are located, while the CPU Experimental Farm in Leon, Iloilo, which is under the college also, is where the CPU Center for Research, Technology Development and Commercial Production of Philippine Native Chicken (CPU CRTDCPPNC), the largest research center for Philippine Native Chicken in the Philippines is located. The university villages for faculties and administration members of Central, the CPU Centennial Village and CPU FA Heritage Ville Subdivision, are located also separately from the main campus which are both located in Pavia, Iloilo, north of the main campus.\n\nCPU's main campus buildings are predominantly painted with eco-friendly lighter shade green color for environmental consciousness and green campus initiative plans for sustainability. The university has laid in place an Air Quality Monitoring System unit, which monitors air quality and the only unit that serves the City of Iloilo. The unit is operated jointly by the university with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The other sustainability programs of the university on the campus include a waste water treatment facility for the waste water that is emitted then will be processed to a safer level before it will be dump back to the environment by the main campus buildings. Back in 2005, the university also launched the \"CPU New Millennium Tree (CPU NMT) for Sustainable Development\". The said program is designed to heighten environmental consciousness on the university, where it seeks to plant thousands of mahogany trees.<ref name=\"Establishment of Millamena Millenium Mahogany Tree project - The CPU New Millennium Tree (CPU NMT) for Sustainable Development, an environment friendly fund generating project. The project is designed to fulfill important human needs and heighten our consciousness of the necessity to preserve an environment for the future of our children and the many generations to come. The concept is rather simple-we simply planted several thousand mahogany trees and campaigned for donors/sponsors that supported New Millenium Trees. When these trees mature in 20 years, then the NMTrees would have generated millions of Pesos – a legacy that every Centralian and friends of Central can be very proud of..\"></ref>\n\nThe incumbent and 17th president (and also the 4th Filipino president) of the University is Teodoro C. Robles. He is an alumnus of the university, where he studied engineering and graduated in 1964. If the two postwar heads Urbano F. Nequin and May A.

It has been designated by the Philippine National Statistics Office on 20 April 1997 as National Statistics Office (NSO) Information Center for Western Visayan region. Consortium with the Silliman University library and the Trinity University of Asia through ACCORD Library Interconnection started in 2000. CPU Library's formal linkage in December 2002 was started with LIBRARY LINK, based at the Filipinas Heritage Library (in Makati City), on Filipiniana materials.\n\nThrough linkages, Central Philippine University Library is a depository of the United Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The library is a regular recipient of library materials from international and local organizations and centers such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Population Council in New York, National Library of the Philippines in Manila, Australian Centre for Publication Acquired for Development (ACPAD), Population Information Network, and the International Rice Research Institute (in Los Baños, Laguna, Philippines). Through the library system's American Studies Resource Center (ASRC), the only for Western Visayas and one of the few in the Philippines, which is located in the main library (Henry Luce III Library), is also a regular recipient from the: Thomas Jefferson Information Center (where the library has the said and one of the only 13 such centers in the Philippines) in Manila, and the United States Information Service. The American Studies Resource Center (ASRC) helps/assists students who want to study in the United States through its Educational Advising Program. A Knowledge for Development Center, donated by the World Bank in consortium with the University was launched in 2008 The CPU World Bank – Knowledge for Development Center is one of the few such centers which are hubs for dialogue and research on development issues established by the World Bank in key cities around the country in partnership with leading state and private universities. The main library is also the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) repository for Western Visayas.\n\nIloilo Mission Hospital (CPU-Iloilo Mission Hospital) serves as the University hospital of Central. The hospital is separate and distinct in identity which operates independently from the university, but is govern and operated solely by personnels from the university. Although serving as community hospital in general, Iloilo Mission Hospital serves as a training, teaching and as a laboratory facility for various medical-related internship; off-campus classes programs of the University colleges and departments of Nursing, Medicine, Medical Laboratory Sciences, Pharmacy and other allied health sciences, while the College of Theology (for its chaplaincy program); and supports the whole medical needs of the whole university. the former President of the university, Juanito Maca Acanto, serves as the CPU-Iloilo Mission Hospital's chairman.\n\nThere is also the CPU Birthing Center located on the main campus that operates with medical and healthcare workers from Iloilo Mission Hospital. The CPU Birthing Center was built to serve the surrounding community exclusively for laboring women. Central Philippine University also through its College of Nursing maintains a linkage with the Capiz Emmanuel Hospital in Roxas City, Capiz. The hospital was founded by Baptist American missionaries in 1913 which serves at present as the university hospital of the Filamer Christian University.\n\nIloilo Mission Hospital sits on a 7.56 acres (3.0 hectares) of land in Jaro, Iloilo City. The 230-300 bed hospital's location is separate from the main campus of the university. It offers a wide array of comprehensive medical and allied health services available to the university's students and to the community in general. It was established in 1901 by Joseph Andrew Hall, a Physician and missionary under the Presbyterian Foreign Mission Board, to serve as a venue for the treatment of health care to the very poor, and has the distinction today as the first Protestant hospital in the country and the second American hospital in Asia.\n\nThe hospital transferred its locations many times, first with its foundation and location in the City Center of Iloilo in 1901 and 1905, and the third site in Jaro District, where the hospital stands until today, was purchased with the help of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society and the local community, because more space was needed for the expansion of the hospital, and in 1931, the new building was completed.\n\nThe hospital pioneered in its School of Nursing in training women for the professional Nursing in the Philippines, which was established in 1906, with three graduates considered as the first three pioneering nurses in the country.\n\nRecent expansion of the hospital includes a 2-storey CPU-IMH Medical Education Training Center (CPU-IMH METC) for CPU's College of Medicine, 4-storey modern (IMH) Iloilo Mission Hospital Medical Arts Building and the 7-storey modernly designed Iloilo Mission Hospital Medical Center (IMH Medical Center) which will open in July 2020.\n\nThe university, has an active research and extension program that cover various researchers and extension activities. Central collaborates since then with various national and local government agencies, non-profit organizations, international and local industries and institutions for research in different fields.\n\nThe University annually holds a Research and Development Week. In 2006, the Philippine Commission on Higher Education (Philippines) (CHED) awarded CPU Research Center research program as one of the 2006 Best Higher Education Institution (HEI) Research Program in the country and the lone awardee from Region 6. In 2011 also, the university received the Best Higher Education Institution Research Program Award and a Plaque of Recognition as 1st Regional Qualifier for Best Higher Education Institution Research Program (BHEIRP) by the said Philippine government agency for higher education, the Commission on Higher Education. The University is also identified and designated by Commission on Higher Education-National Agriculture and Fisheries Education System (CHED-NAFES) through its College of Agriculture, Resources and Environmental Sciences as the Iloilo-Provincial Institute \nfor Agriculture, where being the host of the annual Regional CPU-Department of Agriculture (Philippines) Agri Research Fair and Exhibits.\n\nOriginally the CPU Research Center lodged as an integral part of the CPU Outreach Center. In 1998, it was separated with the CPU Outreach Center. It was established to coordinate the research activities of the different colleges and units of the university and to convene and facilitate the affairs of the University Research Committee (URESCOM). Since its inception in 1998, CPU Research Center was able to enhance the competency of students, faculty and staff members in conducting research and in applying and disseminating information and findings for the benefit of its constituency and the community. The university's Institutional Research Program (IRP), through the CPU Research Center, which provides undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff with research opportunities for personal and intellectual growth yielded 119 bounded research reports, 53 ongoing institutional researches, and more than 100 faculty and staff were involved in research projects in 2005–2008, and still expanding to this day. The capability building programs that were regularly conducted increased faculty involvement in research. One major indication that the CPU Research Center and CPU links with the industry and business sector has grown stronger was the signing of a memorandum of agreement between the CPU Research Center (URC) and the Iloilo Chamber of Commerce in 2003. The agreement was about CPU Research Center's role as the sole consultant, researcher or trainer for the Iloilo Chamber of Commerce.\n\nUnder the CPU Research Center, the university published two research journals - the \"Scientia et Fides\" and \"Patubas\" and one research newsletter - the \"CPU Research Newsletter\". The \"Scientia et Fides\": Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Review is the official journal of Higher Education Publication of the university and is internationally refereed and publishes semi-annually in print and online platform through the university's website. \"Patubas\" research journal is a refereed multidisciplinary research journal that aims to provide a source of information in the areas of agriculture, natural resources and the environment; social sciences, humanities and the arts; physical and biological sciences; business and management; engineering, information and communications technology; education; health, nursing and medical education; alternative medicine; theology and biblical studies; institutional system and process management; and community baseline impact studies. The objective of the journal is to help education professionals and decision-makers disseminate information and learn from each other's work.\n\n\"Patubas\" is an Ilonggo word for “product” or “fruit”, a fitting description for this multidisciplinary research journal which is indeed, a product or fruit of labors of researchers or the “seekers” of the truth in its varied dimensions. Patubas is published once a year under the auspices CPU Research Center.\n\nIn 2008, Rolex Award for Enterprise awarded the university alumni, professor, inventor and agricultural engineer Alexis Belonio due to his creation of a low-cost and environment friendly invention of the rice husk stove. Engr. Belonio is the first Filipino awardee of Rolex Award for Enterprise that has resulted the establishment of the Center for Rice Husk Energy Technology (CRHET) (Iloilo Rice Husk Center) at Central. The research center is attached to the College of Resources and Environmental Sciences and since it was established, it focuses on various technologies that will be developed and the utilization of rice husks as fuel and clean energy for cooking. The \"CPU Center for Rice Husk Energy Technology\" (CRHET) obtained funding from the Rolex Awards for Enterprise 2008.\n\nCPU is also the Department of Energy (Philippines) Affiliated Renewable Energy Center (CPU-AREC) for Western Visayas. The center is one of the most active among the 14 such in the whole Philippines and is funded by the Philippine Department of Energy and the university where it aims to provide research, extension, education for renewable energy with outreach programs and projects to electrify isolated and non-isolated places in Western Visayas region.\n\nThe University also has a Rockefeller Endowed Soils Analysis and Testing Laboratory. The university is also the sole Philippine Department of Science and Technology (Philippines) heat transfer facility for Western Visayas and collaborates since 2012 with De la Salle University in the fields of transportation and structural engineering research through the Central Philippine University College of Engineering.\n\nThrough the College of Engineering also, the CPU Philippine Center for Packaging Engineering (CPU PC-PET), a packaging testing center and laboratory facility which is the first of its kind in the Southeast Asian region was established in 2012, in which Central gain attention in the fields of science and technology and breakthrough for Packaging Engineering research and development in the country and South East Asia. The Center is backed by the Department of Science and Technology, the Packaging Institute of the Philippines and a private sector's packaging advocate, Systemat-PackEDGE.\n\nAs the Western Visayas region is the leading producer of Native Chickens in 2011 in the Philippines, the university's created a partnership with the Philippine Department of Agriculture along with its College of Agriculture, Resources and Environmental Sciences for the research and development of Philippine Native Chicken in the country through the establishment of the \"CPU Center for Research, Technology Development and Commercial Production of Philippine Native Chicken\". The research facility or center is the largest research station for \"Philippine Native Chicken\" in the Philippines, it is located separately from the main campus and occupies the entire 7 hectare CPU Experimental Farm in the town of Leon, Iloilo. The center is facilitated by the Western Visayas Agriculture and Resources Research and Development Consortium (WESVARRDEC) and funded by the said government agency (Department of Agriculture) and the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD).\n\nThe endeavor of the research and development of the Philippine Native Chicken through the CPU-CARES Research Station for Philippine Native Chicken made Dr. Jaime Cabarles, the CPU College of Agriculture, Resources and Environmental Sciences dean and head of the research facility the 2014 Commission on Higher Education (Philippines) Republica Award National Winner in Natural Sciences and Agriculture category, due to his significant contribution as researcher (Research and Development of Philippine Native Chicken) to Natural Sciences and Agricultural research in the Philippine society.\n\nOther research and auxiliary centers and extension programs of the University includes the CPU Center for Ideation, Realization and Commercialization (CPU CIRAC or CPU TechHub), CPU Research and Developmental Learning Center (Building), CPU Center for Local Governance and Indigenous Peoples Studies; CPU-World Bank Knowledge Development Center (CPU WB-KDC); CPU Appropriate Technology Center (CPU-APPROTECH); CPU Crop Research Laboratory; and the CPU – Social Science Research Institute.\n\n\"\"Central Spirit\"\" which has purportedly served as \"\"a social glue\"\", is a term for camaraderie, unity or reminisce the fond school day memories and activities at Central that has become symbolic of the bond that unites Centralians. \"Central Spirit\" is also contrast to what Central was founded for over a century before by the American missionaries and the school's vision. Moreover, there is also a song titled \"\"Central Spirit\"\" which was composed by one of the school's former American presidents, Dr. Francis H. Rose.\n\nCentral's motto: Scientia et Fides literally means Knowledge and Faith in English. It was chosen by the third head of Central, the late American clergyman Dr. Francis H(oward) Rose, as contrast and coincides to the institution's Christian foundation and belief, which was founded by the pioneer, The Rev. William Orison Valentine.\n\nScientia Science is viewed from the standpoint of Christian understanding that God is the creator and sustainer of everything. Science is an avenue where one would know, understand, and appreciate the scope of God's handiwork as well as explore the magnitude of its potentials for the good of mankind.\n\nFides Faith is basically a gift from God. And as a gift, the exercise of such faith will find meaning and purpose within the sphere of God's sovereign plan and direction. In this regard, such kind of faith becomes active and dynamic. It inspires, influences, and transforms anything that comes in contact with as it continually seeks understanding and expresses itself in noble actions that aim to glorify God.\n\nGold and blue are both official and athletic colors of Central since it became a Junior College in the early 1920s. Gold regards to its \"Scientia\" motto as \"Excellence\" and contrast to the Biblical standpoint alongside with blue for \"Spirituality\" (from its \"Fides\" motto) when chosen as the official colors of Central in the 1920s. Both reference Biblical texts from the books and chapters of 1 Corinthians 3:12–13 and Ephesians 2:20 (for gold) and Numbers 4:6–7, 9,11, 12; 15:38–40 and Exodus 25:4; 26:1, 31, 36; 28:28, 31 (for blue).\n\nA month long-fete festival of lights and music which is an attraction every December for the Christmas season in the City of Iloilo that has become a tradition for more than a decade at Central, is held annually since 1998. The main campus major streets and buildings are festooned with Christmas lights during the festival and is flocked by visitors or tourists. The festival, starts traditionally in the first week of December, where at the opening night, a traditional switching on of Christmas lights is followed by a grand fireworks display. On the second night after the opening, A Christmas musicale and a signing contest opens with contestants not only from the university but from the surrounding community.\n\nIn 2015, although for many years the University Day festivity was celebrated in August until September, it was moved and combined with the Foundation Day that starts from September and ends in the first week of October. The festivity characterized with intramural games between colleges and schools that starts in September, the annual famous Mr. and Ms. CPU pageant, a university picnic and concerts at the Promenade (Alumni Promenade and Concert Park). At the last days of the celebration is the Foundation day which is held every 1 October where the university commemorates its founding by the American missionaries as the Bible School and Jaro Industrial School, Central's two forerunner schools in 1905. The commemoration characterized also with a civic parade, a memorial service for the founding father of Central William Valentine and his co-founders, the traditional singing of the Star Spangled Banner along with the raising of the flag of the United States and the Philippines.\n\nCentral is member of the Private Schools Athletic Association (PRISAA) and the Philippine University Games (UniGames). The university's athletic nickname, \"Golden Lions\" represents the university in athletic games.\n\nThe \"Golden Lions\" which is established through a proposal by the Reverend Francis Neil G. Jalando-on, Coach of the College Table Tennis Teams and Associate Pastor of the University Church, is based on the following Bible verses in contrast as the university was founded by the American Baptist missionaries: (Proverbs 28:1) \"\"The godly are as bold as lions\"\", (Proverbs 30:30) \"\"The lion, mighty among beasts, does not retreat from anyone\"\", (2 Samuel) 17:10 \"\"The bravest are those whose heart is like the heart of a lion\"\", (Revelation 5:5) \"\"The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed\"\" — JESUS is the Lion of Judah.\n\nCentral has adequate playgrounds and facilities for sports and athletic activities.\n\nThe CPU Gymnasium (Central Philippine University Gymnasium) is the largest university and athletic gymnasium in Western Visayas and can serve as a venue for the following sports: basketball, sepak takraw, badminton, table tennis, lawn tennis, and volleyball. CPU Gymnasium has also can host musical, live and band concerts. The CPU Gymnasium been the official home of the official athletics team of Central and is called \"The Lion's Den\", the CPU Golden Lions. Outdoor sports such as soccer and softball can be played at the football grounds, CPU Softball Field and the ground situated at the Half-moon Drive.\n\nThe University hosted the 14th Philippine University Games (UniGames). There is also an Olympic size CPU swimming pool for swimming competitions. The University main campus can accommodate Triathlon sports event. The University Tennis Courts is also available for use by students and tennis enthusiasts. CPU's Olympic-sized swimming pool is the most modern and biggest school-based pool in Western Visayas. It provides a very convenient swimming area for PE students, athletes, alumni and friends of CPU. Central Philippine University is famed for its football games.\n\nThe CPU International Football Team, composed of foreign students who are studying at Central matched with the Philippine Football Federation team (Azkals) in 2010 in Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo. Most football players of Central are under the roster of Stallion F.C., a club that plays for the United Football League (UFL) and is also affiliated with Iloilo F.A. (IFA). CPU also hosted the PFF Smart Club Championship-Group B on 9–13 August 2011 which was facilitated by Iloilo Football Association wherein the university is one of the hosts venue.\n\nIn April 2012, the Western Visayas (PRISAA) Private Schools Athletic Association – Softball team, composed wholly and represented by Central's Softball team, defeated the regional teams including the last contingent (Region 10) and wins second time since 2011 with the Gold medal in the 59th National PRISAA Championship. The 59th National PRISAA was held in Cebu City in 2012.\n\nStudents are encouraged to form groups that enhance their desire for study. The Student Organization Committee (SOC) acts as the regulatory body for all student campus organizations. It approves the registration and supervises the activities of student campus organizations. These include religious and cultural groups, academic and athletic clubs and groups. Notable organizations are: \"Central Philippine University Republic\" (CPU Republic), official student governing body of the university (still in continuous operation); CPU Parliamentarian Society; the \"Central Echo\"; \"CPU Bahandi Singers\"; CPU Handbell Choir (the first and only 5-octave handbell choir in the country); and \"CPU Mountaineering Society\". There is also a \"Foreign Students' Organization\" that assists the university to invite more foreign students to attend Central.\n\nThere are more than 10 fraternities and six sororities that are local, international or founded in the university that maintains a chapters at Central, as well as fraternity for those who are taking Juris Doctor (J.D.) course, Order of Kalantiao, and Phi Beta Epsilon of the College of Engineering.\n\nVarious apartment facilities, such as dormitories, boarding homes are located on the university's main campus and the university hospital, the Iloilo Mission Hospital which, could provide living accommodations to students. Franklin Hall, is for male residents; Weston Hall, for female residents; while Anna V. Johnson Hall, where the College of Theology houses, is considered as the only residential college in the university, where its living accommodation is limited to the said college; Roselund Hostel/House, Gonzaga House, and Executive House are apartments and boarders are both local and foreign students who are studying at Central; are all located on the main campus, and there is also Nurses home in each hospitals of the university, that serves as a boarding house for students who are taking Nursing course, when classes and internship is conducted at the both two university hospitals. American Village is located inside the campus with various houses for the university faculties and a hostel for students.\n\nThere are also two residential villages located separately from the University. The CPU Centennial Village, a 2.9-hectare subdivision only for the faculty members of the university. The CPU Centennial Village has 185 saleable units with 6 types of housing models and CPU FA Heritage Ville Subdivision/CPU Heritage Subdivision is located and adjacent, just few meters away from the location of CPU Centennial Village in Anilao, Pavia, Iloilo. It provides residential community amenities for the faculty and administrative staff of the university.\n\nLiving in the dormitories and villages is considered a privilege that is granted to the students and faculties who comply with the rules and regulations of the University. Formal admission procedures is followed before admitting anyone to the dormitories and villages of the university.\n\nThe Central Echo (\"CE\") is the official student publication of CPU. It was founded in 1910, five years after Jaro Industrial School opened. Established originally as \"The Hoe\", The Central Echo evolved to be one of the best college student publications in the Western Visayas region: It has been recognized as Second Best Magazine and Fifth Best Newspaper by the Philippine Information Agency-Region 6 in 2009. \"Central Echo\" publishes and circulates newspaper twice in a regular semester, it publishes magazine also, an art portfolio \"(Paraw)\" and a summer literary folio every summer. Other publications of the university include \"The Centralite\", the official yearbook; \"The Central Post\", the official publication of the office of the university president; and the \"Central High Echo\", the official publication of the High School Department.\n\nEvery college in the university has its own publication. Some of the student writers are associate members of the Iloilo Press Club and the College Editors Guild of the Philippines.\n\nPeople associated or affiliated such as students, faculty members, administrators, honorary degree holders, or other people with Central are called Centralians. The university maintains an alumni association with various chapters throughout the country and different countries abroad. Notable people of the university include:\n\n\n\n"}

He is well known for his 1980s work on \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" and later for his work on \"Spider-Girl\" whom he co-created with writer Tom DeFalco. Frenz and DeFalco had earlier co-created the New Warriors in the pages of \"Thor\".\n\nFrenz began working for Marvel Comics in the early 1980s. Frenz's early work includes such titles as \"Ka-Zar the Savage\", \"Star Wars\", \"The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones\", and \"Marvel Saga\". His first credited story for Marvel was published in \"Ka-Zar the Savage\" #16 (July 1982).\nFrenz has a history of working on comic book series in which the characters were not in their original costumes/identities. Spider-Man wore his black costume, Thor took on a new secret identity and look, and Superman changed costumes and powers while Frenz was the regular artist on their titles.\n\nFrenz became the regular artist on \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" in 1984 and the stories he pencilled included \"The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man\" in issue #248 (Jan. 1984) and the first appearance of Spider-Man's black costume in issue #252 (May 1984). Among the new characters introduced during his run were the Puma in issue #256 (Sept. 1984) and Silver Sable in #265 (June 1985). Frenz and Tom DeFalco revealed that the \"black suit\" was an alien creature in issue #258 (Nov. 1984). Frenz drew \"The Amazing Spider-Man Annual\" #18 (1984), a story written by Stan Lee, which featured the wedding of Spider-Man supporting characters J. Jonah Jameson and Marla Madison. Frenz had originally been brought onto the series as a short-term substitute for John Romita Jr., but was retained when it became apparent that he meshed well with series writer DeFalco. Frenz recounted: \n\nJim Owsley, editor of the Spider-Man titles at the time, has noted that \"Frenz was \"passionate\" about Spider-Man, verging on fanatical.\" In 1986, Frenz and DeFalco were removed from \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" by Owsley. Frenz and DeFalco became the creative team on \"Thor\" in 1987 and introduced the Eric Masterson character in \"Thor\" #391 (May 1988). Eric Masterson later became the superhero known as Thunderstrike and received his own series by DeFalco and Frenz in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Frenz moved to DC Comics and became the artist on \"Superman\". The following year, he was one of the many creators who contributed to the \"\" one-shot wherein the title character married Lois Lane. Superman received a new costume and new superpowers in \"Superman\" vol. 2 #123 (May 1997). Frenz drew part of the \"Superman Red/Superman Blue\" one-shot which launched the storyline of the same name which ran through the various Superman titles.\n\nFrenz returned to Marvel with the \"Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives\" limited series, written by Roger Stern, in 1997.

Competitor teams each represent different island communities (with one team from the peninsula of Gibraltar) which are IIGA members. Currently all competitor teams represent non-sovereign territories of European nations - some within European waters and some further overseas.\n\nThe most recent edition was 2019 which took place in Gibraltar, with around 2,000 competitors from 22 competing islands or island groups competing in 14 sports. The next games will be hosted by Guernsey in 2021.\n\nThe Island Games began in 1985 as the \"Inter-Island Games\", as part of the Isle of Man International Year of Sport, and were intended to be a one-off sporting celebration only. Geoffrey Corlett, who became the first Games Director, not only contacted the islands surrounding the United Kingdom, but also encouraged the countries of Iceland and Malta, the territories of Faroe Islands, Greenland, Saint Helena, the Channel Islands and others to participate.\n\nInitially, fifteen islands with 600 competitors and officials took part in seven sports, with the total cost of staging the Games being put at £70,000. The track and field events were held on an eight-lane grass track, a far cry from the current games, which now use synthetic tracks in stadiums capable of holding thousands of spectators. The Games of 1985 were so successful that organisers decided to hold a similar event two years later. The games have grown from strength to strength with limits now in place over the number of teams, currently 23 and the number of sports at each games, currently 12–14. Sark could be considered the most successful island, their population of 600 having acquired 20 medals by 2015, one for every 30 people.\n\nNatWest International has been the main sponsor of the games since 1999. In April 2018, they signed a deal extending their sponsorship until at least 2021.\n\nGuernsey put in a bid for the 2021 games following the Faroe Islands' withdrawal from hosting.

So are the Isle of Man.\n\nIn May 2018, the Parliament of the Faroe Islands guaranteed €1,500,000 towards hosting the Games in or before 2029.\n\nIn August 2018 it was reported that the Falkland Islands are considering hosting the Games in 2033, and \"the Island Games Executive is planning to visit the Falklands in 2020 for their Spring Meeting\" to discuss the proposition.\n\nA total of twenty-seven islands, island groups or territories have participated in the Island Games; eleven of these have participated in every Island Games.\n\nOf the 24 current IIGA members, two (Bermuda and the Cayman Islands) have competed in their own right at the Olympic Games. Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey and St. Helena have each sent teams to the Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe host country chooses between 12 and 14 different sports for their games from this list:\nNotably, the Island Games' football tournament is one of the most well-established tournaments of non-FIFA international football.\n\nIslanders who have gone on to participate in Olympic Games events include:\n\n"}

{"id": "2218225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218225", "title": "Vessel element", "text": "Vessel element\n\nA vessel element or vessel member is one of the cell types found in xylem, the water conducting tissue of plants. Vessel elements are typically found in flowering plants (angiosperms) but absent from most gymnosperms such as conifers. Vessel elements are the main feature distinguishing the \"hardwood\" of angiosperms from the \"softwood\" of conifers.\n\nXylem is the tissue in vascular plants which conducts water (and substances dissolved in it) upwards in a plant. There are two kinds of cell which are involved in the actual transport: tracheids and vessel elements. Vessel elements are the building blocks of vessels, which constitute the major part of the water transporting system in those plants in which they occur. Vessels form an efficient system for transporting water (including necessary minerals) from the root to the leaves and other parts of the plant.\n\nIn secondary xylem – the xylem which is produced as a stem thickens rather than when it first appears – a vessel element originates from the vascular cambium. A long cell, oriented along the axis of the stem, called a \"fusiform initial\", divides along its length forming new vessel elements. The cell wall of a vessel element becomes strongly \"lignified\", i.e. it develops reinforcing material made of lignin. The side walls of a vessel element have pits: more or less circular regions in contact with neighbouring cells. Tracheids also have pits, but only vessel elements have openings at both ends that connect individual vessel elements to form a continuous tubular vessel. These end openings are called perforations or perforation plates. They have a variety of shapes: the most common are the simple perforation (a simple opening) and the scalariform perforation (several elongated openings in a ladder-like design). Other types include the foraminate perforation plate (several round openings) and the reticulate perforation plate (a net-like pattern, with many openings).\n\nAt maturity the protoplast – the living material of the cell – dies and disappears, but the lignified cell walls persist. A vessel element is then a dead cell, but one that still has a function, and is still being protected by surrounding living cells.\n\nThe presence of vessels in xylem has been considered to be one of the key innovations that led to the success of the flowering plants. It was once thought that vessel elements were an evolutionary innovation of flowering plants, but their absence from some basal angiosperms and their presence in some members of the Gnetales suggest that this hypothesis must be re-examined; vessel elements in Gnetales may not be homologous with those of angiosperms, or vessel elements that originated in a precursor to the angiosperms may have been subsequently lost in some basal lineages (e.g., Amborellaceae, Tetracentraceae, Trochodendraceae, and Winteraceae), described by Arthur Cronquist as \"primitively vesselless\". Cronquist considered the vessels of \"Gnetum\" to be convergent with those of angiosperms.\n\nVessel-like cells have also been found in the xylem of \"Equisetum\" (horsetails), \"Selaginella\" (spike-mosses), \"Pteridium aquilinum\" (bracken fern), \"Marsilea\" and \"Regnellidium\" (aquatic ferns), and the enigmatic fossil group Gigantopteridales. In these cases, it is generally agreed that the vessels evolved independently. It is possible that vessels may have appeared more than once among the angiosperms as well.\n\n\n"}

Situated on the Roman way between the important towns of Dax and Saragossa, its position was strategic. Today known as Saint-Great, Gratus of Oloron became in 506 the first known archbishop of the Ancient Diocese of Oloron then known as \"Iluro\".\n\nThe history of the town during the Migration Period is little known. In 1080, the viscount Centule V, Viscount of Béarn built the new city of \"Oloron\" (medieval version of the Roman name Iluro) on the opposite side of the river from the diocese center. Centulle V restored the Roman walls and founded the strong city of Oloron that was to be used as a base to retake the Aragon held by the Maures. The Oloron Cathedral was built at the beginning of the 12th century. The viscountal town of Oloron and the episcopal town of Sainte-Marie were then rivals, but Oloron strove on its textile industry and commerce with neighbouring Spain. Sainte-Marie became economically dependent upon Oloron.\n\nThe 18th century was the beginning of revival for Sainte-Marie as the end of French Wars of Religion allowed for restorations and new religious constructions in the town : cathedral, seminary, church Saint-Pierre. Moreover, the continued boom of commerce with Spain accelerated the construction of better communication and transportation routes to Oloron and Sainte-Marie.\n\nWith the French Revolution Oloron lost its diocese to Bayonne but gained administrative importance by becoming one of the sous-préfectures of the new Republic. In the 1858, the regent Impress Eugénie imposed the reunification of the towns of Oloron and Sainte-Marie.\n\nSituated at the feet of the Pyrénées, 50 km from the Spanish border and 100 km from the Atlantic ocean, Oloron-Sainte-Marie is at the confluence of two \"gaves\" (mountain rivers), the Gave d'Aspe and the Gave d'Ossau that merge to form the gave d'Oloron. Capital of the Haut-Béarn, Oloron-Sainte-Marie is also at the point of origin of the three Haut-Béarn valleys : the Aspe Valley, the Ossau Valley and the Barétous Valley.\n\nNeighboring communes: Esquiule, Moumour, Ledeuix, Estos, Cardesse, Monein, Goès, Précilhon, Escout, Herrère, Ogeu-les-Bains, Buziet, Arudy, Escot, Asasp-Arros, Lurbe-Saint-Christau, Eysus, Gurmençon, Bidos, Agnos, Ance and Féas.\n\nThe town has an oceanic climate, with mild and humid winters and cool or moderately warm summers. Rain is quite abundant (above 900 mm per year) and is mostly concentrated during cold season.\n\nThe Oloron economy is dominated by two well known manufacturing businesses:\n\nOloron is also famous, among hat enthusiasts, as the capital of the basque beret, although the beret business has fallen victim to the widespread collapse of the European textile business as well as changing fashions. Today only one beret business survives in Oloron. This is the Béatex company which employs approximately 80 people.\n\nThe area also benefits from an active agriculture sector, involving animal rearing and general agriculture as well as maize production. It is also part of the AOC defined districts entitled to produce the ewes' cheese, Ossau-Iraty.\n\nThe railway from Pau to Canfranc passes through Oloron. Oloron railway station is served by TER Aquitaine, who operate eight trains per day to Pau and six to Bedous.\n\nPublic transport in the town is provided by a company called La Navette, who operate three bus routes.\n\nOloron - Herrère Aérodrome is an aerodrome five kilometers southeast of Oloron. It is predominantly used for light aviation and leisure.\n\nThe local vernacular language is the Béarnese dialect, a dialect of Gascon language. One of the eight primary schools of Oloron is a Calandreta, a French/Bearnese bilingual school.\n\nThe demonym corresponding to Oloron-Sainte-Marie is Oloronais.\n\nThe town received the label French Towns and Lands of Art and History in November 2006.\n\nOloron's architectural and historical landmarks :\n\nOloron is home to a number of festivals :\n\nOloron-Sainte-Marie has a theatre and concert venue (espace Pierre Jéliote).\n\nThe town is renowned for its hearty vegetables, beans and meat soup, the garbure, for the Ossau-Iraty cheese, and for a delicacy invented by a local baker in 1925, the pastry \"le Russe\".\n\nOloron-Sainte-Marie was the birthplace of:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2218249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218249", "title": "Ang mo", "text": "Ang mo\n\nAng mo (), or ang moh, is a racial descriptor used to refer to white people that is sometimes seen as a pejorative epithet. It is mainly used in Singapore and Taiwan, and to a lesser extent Malaysia and Thailand. It literally means \"red-haired\" and originates from Hokkien, a variety of Southern Min. The usage is similar to the Cantonese term \"gweilo\" (), which is more commonly used in Hong Kong and Macau, or the Japanese term in Japan.\n\nOther similar terms include ang mo kow (), ang mo kui (), ang mo lang (). Although the term has historically had some derogatory connotations, it has entered common parlance as a neutral term, where it refers to a person of European descent or, when used as an adjective, Western culture in general.\n\nThe earliest origin for the term \"ang mo\" could be traced to the contact between Hokkien (Southern Min) speakers in southern Fujian with the Portuguese Empire and Dutch East India Company during the Haijin (\"Sea Ban\") period in the 16th and 17th century.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company failed in its attempt to force their way into Fujian to trade in the 1620s during the Sino-Dutch conflicts and were called \"ang mo\" by the locals. The Dutch East India Company and then the Spanish Empire had colonized Taiwan and the Spanish built Fort San Domingo in Tamsui, Taiwan. The Dutch later drove the Spanish out and seized the Fort which also became known as \"City of the Red-Haired\" () in Taiwanese Hokkien. Dutch people were known in Taiwan as \"ang mo lang\" (\"red-haired people\") in Taiwanese Hokkien. This is most likely because red hair is a common trait among the Dutch. This historical term \"ang mo lang\" continues to be used in the context of Taiwanese history to refer to Dutch people.\n\nThe Chinese characters for \"ang mo\" are the same as those in the historical Japanese term , which was used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as an epithet for (northwestern European) white people. It primarily referred to Dutch traders who were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan during the Sakoku, its 200-year period of isolation. Portuguese and Spanish traders were in contrast referred to as , which is in turn cognate to the Chinese \"nanman\" and means \"southern barbarians\".\n\nDuring the 19th century, Walter Henry Medhurst made a reference in his academic work \"A Dictionary of the Hok-Këèn Dialect of the Chinese Language\" that \"âng mô\" (\"red haired\"), generally applied to the English people. With the large migration of the Hoklo south, mostly to Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, the term \"ang moh\" became more widespread and was used to refer to white people in general.\n\nThe term \"ang mo\" is sometimes viewed as racist and derogatory by Caucasians. Others, however, maintain it is acceptable, making it in some contexts a reclaimed word. Despite this ambiguity, it is a widely used term, at least among non-Westerners. It appears, for instance, in Singaporean newspapers such as \"The Straits Times\", and in television programs and films. The term was used in the film \"I Not Stupid\", when several employees in the marketing department of their company resented a particular white individual because they perceived that preference had been shown to him because of his race.\n\nIn Singapore and Taiwan, and to a lesser extent among Chinese Malaysians, the term \"ang mo sai\" () is a derogatory term used within the Chinese community for mocking other Chinese who are not able to read Chinese, as they are seen to have abandoned their Asian cultural identity or lost touch with it in order to adopt a Western one.\n\n\n"}

Gerbrandy worked as a lawyer and prosecutor from February 1911 until August 1920 in Leiden from February 1911 until March 1914 and in Sneek from March 1914 until August 1920. Gerbrandy also served in the military reserve force of the Royal Netherlands Army as a Captain during World War I from December 1914 until December 1918. Gerbrandy served on the Municipal Council of Sneek from April 1916 until January 1930 and served on the Provincial-Council of Friesland from July 1919 until August 1920 and as a member of the Provincial-Executive of Friesland from August 1920 until January 1930. Gerbrandy worked as a professor of Corporate law, Competition law and Property law at the Free University Amsterdam from 15 January 1930 until 10 August 1939. Gerbrandy also became active in the public sector occupying numerous seats as a nonprofit director on several boards of directors and supervisory boards and served on several and councils on behalf of the government ( and the ). On 27 July 1939 the Cabinet Colijn V was dismissed by Queen Wilhelmina and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the cabinet formation of 1939 when it was replaced by the Cabinet De Geer II with Gerbrandy appointed as Minister of Justice, taking office on 10 August 1939.\n\nOn 10 May 1940 Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands and the government fled to London to escape the German occupation. The Cabinet De Geer II fell on 26 August 1940 after a conflict between Queen Wilhelmina and Prime Minister Dirk Jan de Geer and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity. Shortly thereafter Gerbrandy was approached by the Vice-President of the Council of State Frans Beelaerts van Blokland as a candidate for Prime Minister, Gerbrandy accepted and was appointed as Formateur to form a new War cabinet. The following cabinet formation of 1940 resulted in a coalition agreement between the Anti-Revolutionary Party, the Roman Catholic State Party (RKSP), the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), the Christian Historical Union (CHU), the Free-thinking Democratic League (VDB) and the Liberal State Party (LSP) to from a Government of National Unity which formed the Cabinet Gerbrandy I with Gerbrandy becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands and continuing as Minister of Justice, taking office on 3 September 1940. The Cabinet Gerbrandy I fell on 12 June 1941 after a conflict between Queen Wilhelmina and Minister of Defence Adriaan Dijxhoorn and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the cabinet formation of 1941 that resulted in the continuation of the coalition agreement which formed the Cabinet Gerbrandy II with Gerbrandy continuing as Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, taking office on 27 July 1941. Gerbrandy was also appointed as Minister of Colonial Affairs following the resignation of Charles Welter and dual served in both positions, taking office on 17 November 1941. On 21 February 1942 Gerbrandy resigned as Minister of Justice following the appointment of Jan van Angeren. On 21 May 1942 Gerbrandy resigned as Minister of Colonial Affairs following the appointment of Hubertus van Mook and was appointment as Minister of General Warfare the same day. On 27 January 1945 Gerbrandy forced Minister of the Interior Jaap Burger to resign following an impromptu remark during a radio address where Burger differentiated between \"wrongful\" Dutch civilians (\"foute Nederlanders\") and Dutch civilians who made a mistake (\"Nederlanders die een fout hebben gemaakt\") but because Gerbrandy did not discuss this with rest of the cabinet all the Social Democratic Workers' Party cabinet members announced there resignation and the cabinet continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until it was replaced by the Cabinet Gerbrandy III with Gerbrandy remaining Prime Minister and Minister of General Warfare and appointed again as Minister of Justice, taking office on 23 February 1945. Following the end of World War II Queen Wilhelmina ordered the formation of a new Government of National Unity to reorganize the state and make preparations for new elections. Following the cabinet formation of 1945 Gerbrandy was not giving a cabinet post in the new cabinet, the Cabinet Gerbrandy III was replaced by the Cabinet Schermerhorn–Drees on 25 June 1945.\n\nGerbrandy remained in active politics, he was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 1948, serving as a frontbencher from 27 July 1948 until 3 July 1956. Gerbrandy subsequently returned as a Member of the House of Representatives after Jelle Zijlstra was appointed as Ministers of Economic Affairs in the Cabinet Drees I following the election of 1956, taking office on 23 October 1956. In December 1958 Gerbrandy announced that he wouldn't stand for the election of 1959 and continued to serve until the end of the parliamentary term on 20 March 1959.\n\nPieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy was born on 13 April 1885 in the village of Goënga near Sneek, in the province of Friesland, in the Netherlands. He was an ethnic Frisian, and his name is styled in the traditional Frisian way: first name (\"Pieter\"), patronymic (\"Sjoerds\", meaning \"son of Sjoerd\"), family name (Gerbrandy). Incidentally, the name Gerbrandy is also a patronymic; his great-great-grandfather Jouke Gerbrens (1769–1840) took 'Gerbrandy’ as a family name on 30 December 1811.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1930, he was a member of the States of Friesland for the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP), and became a professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (1930). Against his party's advice he was Minister of Justice (1939).\n\nThe royal family and many leading politicians had fled to London in 1940. There, they formed a government in exile. After De Geer's resignation and because of Gerbrandy's rejection of De Geer's defeatism, Queen Wilhelmina appointed him as prime minister of the Dutch government in exile, serving in turn as minister of justice, the Colonies, and the general conduct of the War. On his initiative, the Dutch government started to broadcast from Radio Oranje. This station supplied the Dutch population with information from the free world whilst under the occupation of Nazi Germany. His premature broadcast announcement on 4 September 1944 that Allied forces had crossed the border prompted the celebrations of Dolle Dinsdag (Mad Tuesday), and undermined the morale of the German occupiers. Gerbrandy became an inspirational figure to Dutch citizens during the wartime period, as such he was awarded a medal of valour in 1950 and knighted by HRH Princess Wilhelmina.\n\nAfter the liberation of the south in 1945, he formed a new cabinet without socialists, which was alleged to be strictly subordinated to military rule. He resigned after the total liberation. He strongly opposed the government's \"Indonesian policy\", and in 1946–50 chaired the National Committee for the Maintenance of the Kingdom's Unity, which was against the separation of Indonesia and supported the idea of a Republic of the South Moluccas.\n\nIn 1950, his book \"Indonesia\" was published, offering an explanation of the history of the relationship of the two nations from the 1600s to 1948, including \"The Indies under the Netherland's Rule, The Rule of Law, The Japanese Occupation\" and \"Chaos,\" with each section outlining his detailed observations.\n\nIn 1948, he returned to the Dutch Parliament. However, his hot temper alienated his party members. In 1956, he was member of a commission which investigated the affair surrounding Greet Hofmans. In 1959, he resigned as a member of Parliament.\n\nOn 18 May 1911 Gerbrandy married Hendrina Elisabeth Sikkel (26 February 1886 – 4 May 1980). Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy died on 7 September 1961 in The Hague at the age of 76.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2218269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218269", "title": "Polymersome", "text": "Polymersome\n\nIn biotechnology, polymersomes are a class of artificial vesicles, tiny hollow spheres that enclose a solution. Polymersomes are made using amphiphilic synthetic block copolymers to form the vesicle membrane, and have radii ranging from 50 nm to 5 µm or more. Most reported polymersomes contain an aqueous solution in their core and are useful for encapsulating and protecting sensitive molecules, such as drugs, enzymes, other proteins and peptides, and DNA and RNA fragments. The polymersome membrane provides a physical barrier that isolates the encapsulated material from external materials, such as those found in biological systems.\n\nSynthosomes are polymersomes engineered to contain channels (transmembrane proteins) that allow certain chemicals to pass through the membrane, into or out of the vesicle. This allows for the collection or enzymatic modification of these substances.\n\nThe term \"polymersome\" for vesicles made from block copolymers was coined in 1999. Polymersomes are similar to liposomes, which are vesicles formed from naturally occurring lipids. While having many of the properties of natural liposomes, polymersomes exhibit increased stability and reduced permeability. Furthermore, the use of synthetic polymers enables designers to manipulate the characteristics of the membrane and thus control permeability, release rates, stability and other properties of the polymersome.\n\nSeveral different morphologies of the block copolymer used to create the polymersome have been used. The most frequently used are the linear diblock or triblock copolymers. In these cases, the block copolymer has one block that is hydrophobic; the other block or blocks are hydrophilic. Other morphologies used include comb copolymers, where the backbone block is hydrophilic and the comb branches are hydrophobic, and dendronized block copolymers, where the dendrimer portion is hydrophilic.\n\nIn the case of diblock, comb and dendronized copolymers the polymersome membrane has the same bilayer morphology of a liposome, with the hydrophobic blocks of the two layers facing each other in the interior of the membrane. In the case of triblock copolymers the membrane is a monolayer that mimics a bilayer, the central block filling the role of the two facing hydrophobic blocks of a bilayer.\n\nIn general they can be prepared by the methods used in the preparation of liposomes. Film rehydration, direct injection method or dissolution method.\n\nPolymersomes that contain active enzymes and that provide a way to selectively transport substrates for conversion by those enzymes have been described as nanoreactors.\n\nPolymersomes have been used to create controlled release drug delivery systems. Similar to coating liposomes with polyethylene glycol, polymersomes can be made invisible to the immune system if the hydrophilic block consists of polyethylene glycol. Thus, polymersomes are useful carriers for targeted medication.\n\nFor in vivo applications, polymersomes are de facto limited to the use of FDA-approved polymers as most pharmaceutical firms are unlikely to develop novel polymers due to cost issues. Fortunately there are a number of such polymers available, with varying properties, including:\n\n\"Hydrophilic blocks\"\n\n\"Hydrophobic blocks\"\n\nIf enough of the block copolymer molecules that make up a polymersome are cross-linked, the polymersome can be made into a transportable powder.\n\nPolymersomes can be used to make an artificial cell if hemoglobin and other components are added. The first artificial cell was made by Thomas Chang.\n\n"}

This resulted in reversing the direction of the one-way system on the quays to north quays eastbound/south quays westbound. (Prior to the bridge's opening, the south quays carried all eastbound traffic. Traffic coming eastbound from Parkgate Street ran via Benburb Street and Mellowes Bridge. Westbound traffic heading towards St. John's Road West would cross from the north quays via Rory O'Moore Bridge onto Victoria Quay, which had two-way traffic until the Sherwin Bridge opened.

She was the granddaughter of Sir Thomas Chaworth (d.1459), who had four sons, Sir William Chaworth (d.1467), John Chaworth (d. 1464), Sir Thomas Chaworth (d. May 1465), and George Chaworth (d.1466).\n\nIn 1465 Joan's father, Sir William, was described as 'a sickly man', unable even to ride, and died within two years. Joan's only brother, Thomas Chaworth (1457–1483), married Margaret Talbot, daughter of John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, and sister of John Talbot, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, but he suffered a mental illness and died without issue in 1483.\n\nSir Thomas Chaworth's three younger sons had all also died by that time, and only the fourth son, George, left surviving male issue. John Chaworth was murdered in 1464, leaving an only son, Thomas, who died without issue in December 1485; Sir Thomas Chaworth died without issue in May 1465; and George Chaworth died in 1466, leaving a young grandson, George Chaworth (d.1521), who inherited the manors of Wiverton and Edwalton, and was ancestor of George Chaworth (d.1639), created Viscount Chaworth of Armagh in 1628. With the death of Joan's brother Thomas in 1483, the male Chaworth line was thus all but extinguished, and Joan, as her brother's heir at law, inherited most of the extensive Chaworth estates.\n\nBy her marriage to John Ormond (d.1503), Joan had three daughters, among whom any barony of Chaworth which had been created by a writ in 1299 to her ancestor, Thomas de Chaworth (d.1315), is considered to have fallen into abeyance.\n\nJoan died 29 August 1507.

The lead track was written by the band's founding mainstay, Tim Freedman, together with Pinky Beecroft (Matt Ford) and Chit Chat Von Loopin Stab (Glen Dormand): both from the band, Machine Gun Fellatio. It was produced by Freedman with Rob Taylor. \"No Aphrodisiac\" won Song of the Year at the ARIA Music Awards of 1998.\n\nThe lead track is the band's most well known song on national youth radio station, Triple J: it was listed at No. 1 on their Hottest 100 for 1997. Former Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, for whom the band was named, announced news of their win on air. One of its B-sides is \"Gough\". Machine Gun Fellatio provided a re-mix of \"No Aphrodisiac\" for the remixes version of the single.\n\n\"No Aphrodisiac\" was written for Freedman's then-girlfriend, who was living in Melbourne, while he was in Sydney.

Pinky Beecroft and Chit Chat had just played me a demo of theirs, which consisted of very funny personal classifieds, and we used 6 lines of that to finish the song.\" One of the lyric lines is \"truth, beauty and a picture of you\", Freedman later explained \"their role in the song is just to be comedic. I'm saying 'I miss you but the universe will turn me on in your absence'. Truth of course doesn't exist, and beauty is all.\"\n\nAllMusic's Jonathan Lewis felt it was \"a melancholy, piano-driven song about long-distance relationships\". According to Bernard Zuel of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", it was \"A ballad about infidelity, or even masturbation – 'there's no aphrodisiac like loneliness' – it became a national love-song request.

The tool of the trade of the theatrical master electrician is the adjustable spanner or crescent wrench, used to secure stage lighting instruments from lighting positions in the theatre. This wrench is typically attached to the belt or wrist with a lanyard, which is important because the master electrician tends to work at great height, from ladders, lift tables, catwalks, or lighting trusses, where a falling wrench may hurt people or damage property below.\n\nThe master electrician supervises and is responsible for all other electricians working on any construction or installation project.

After some controversy Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council decided on 7 March 2007 that the sculptures should be permanently installed at the beach.\n\nThe work consists of cast iron figures which face out to sea, spread over a stretch of beach between Waterloo and Blundellsands. Each figure is tall and weighs around . The figures are cast replicas of Gormley's own body. As the tides ebb and flow, the figures are revealed and submerged by the sea. The figures were cast at Hargreaves Foundry in Halifax, West Yorkshire and the Joseph and Jesse Siddons Foundry in West Bromwich by foundryman Derek Alexander.\n\n\"Another Place\" was first exhibited on the beach of Cuxhaven, Germany, in 1997 followed by Stavanger in Norway and De Panne in Belgium. It was the subject of much controversy in Merseyside, although many people considered the figures to be beautiful pieces of art, and tourism in the local area increased.\n\nOriginally, the statues were due to be relocated in November 2007. Those who use the beach for watersports were among the most vocal in their resistance to the figures remaining, citing safety concerns. The coastguard also expressed safety concerns, fearing that tourists could become stuck in soft sand and get cut off by the tide. Conservationists, meanwhile, complained that bird-feeding areas had been compromised by the increased tourist traffic. Art lovers and local businesses, on the other hand, lobbied for the statues to stay. Gormley himself supported the proposal to keep the statues at Crosby Beach, saying the location was \"ideal\".\nIn October 2006, the local council refused to give permission for the statues to stay, prompting Gormley to criticise what he called Britain's \"risk-averse culture.\" He stated, \"When I have been down on the beach myself, the majority of people have been intrigued, amused, sometimes very moved.\" The company \"Another Place Ltd\" was established to campaign for the figures' permanent installation and appealed the council's decision.\n\nIn March 2007, permission was granted for \"Another Place\" to remain at Crosby Beach permanently. The approved plan provided for 16 statues to be moved from contentious areas and decreased the installation's area from 232 to 195 hectares. The cost of the work was estimated at £194,000, to be paid by Another Place Ltd with funding from sources including The Northern Way and Northwest Development Agency.\n\nIn a press release, the Chief Executive of Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council, Graham Haywood, said, \"Despite some controversy, this internationally renowned artwork has aroused national and international public and media support ... The Iron Men have placed Crosby and Sefton firmly in the spotlight and the knock-on benefits of this should be felt for years to come.\"\n\nIn 2012, biologists from the University of Liverpool studied the colonisation of the statues by sessile intertidal organisms, such as invasive species of barnacles.\n\n\n"}

Grove Park was developed in the 1920s and 1930s by various developers, but primarily by the Grove Park Development Company. Mr. Grove died in Asheville NC on January 27,1927. He is buried in Paris TN , the town where he first invented his Grove's Chill Tonic with Fred Seely. The community was initially known as Fortified Hills, a name stemming from the Civil War. Grove named the streets for his second wife, Gertrude, his daughter Evelyn (from his first wife, Mary Louisa Moore Grove., and his son, Edwin begat from Gertrude.. Other street names are believed to have been inspired by his grandchildren: Matilda, Hortense, Emily, Elizabeth, Francis, Eleanor, Florence, Margaret, and Eugenia. Many of the side streets created in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s are wide, tree-lined avenues with well-tended frame cottages, brick Tudors and ranches.\n\nGrove Park and Center Hill were both developed during the early part of the 20th century. Prior to 1960 Grove Park and Center Hill were all-white communities. African-Americans began to move into these areas during the 1960s, primarily as an offshoot of growth in the Collier Heights neighborhood. Collier Heights was developed in earnest in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a public-private effort with African Americans handling most of the \"hammers and cash.\" The City of Atlanta published its \"Neighborhood Plan for Collier Heights\" in 1961. The neighborhood would accommodate 7,000 residents and help solve the shortage of quality homes for African Americans.\n\nDonald Lee Hollowell Parkway, one of the major corridors in Northwest Atlanta, was in its splendor during the 1960s, and the area was stable until the early 1970s when suburban growth began to drain the area's vitality. As a result, many longtime businesses closed and were replaced by low-rent business; and as population decreased the area began to deteriorate. In fact, through the turn of the 21st century, the entire area witnessed a steady decline in population, property conditions and the local economy.\n\nHowever, conditions in the area have changed over the past few years as the current trend towards in-town living gains popularity. Neighborhoods throughout the City and especially Northwest Atlanta are experiencing a resurgence of development including new infill residential units and subdivisions as well as major renovations. Grove Park and the Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway Corridor are poised to experience some of this resurgence. The Grove Park area has been dramatically affected by the nation's foreclosure crisis. However, real estate investors expect the proposed development plans to spur the neighborhood's revitalization.\n\nThe population in 2000 was 6,410. The neighborhood is more than 95% African-American. Median household income in 2009 was $31,073 versus $49,981 for the city of Atlanta as a whole.\n\nGrove Park is the original home of Andre 3000, and the Cleveland Browns Pro-Bowl halfback Jamal Lewis.\n\nGrove Park falls on the western edge of the BeltLine. The northeastern boundary of Grove Park is the former Bellwood Quarry - site of the future Westside Park, which will be twice the size Piedmont Park as proposed. Amenities will include tournament-quality baseball fields, a skate park and rink, hiking and mountain biking trails, an amphitheatre which takes advantages of skyline views, a dog park, community gardens and many others attractions. Additionally the neighborhood features several small pocket parks and boulevard parks including Edwin Place Park, Matilda Place Park, North and South Evelyn Place Park, and Elinor Place Park. Finally the neighborhood namesake park Grove Park itself.\n\nGrove Park is also home to the currently under construction Proctor Creek Greenway Trail. The multi-purpose trail will string together more than 400 acres of greenspace, spanning from Maddox Park along the Beltline Westside Trail all the way to the Chattahoochee River. The first phase of the project includes more than two miles of trails, connecting Bankhead MARTA Station to the existing River Park Trail, passing through the planned Westside Quarry Park. Ultimately, plans call for work on the entire trail to be completed in six segments, according to a master plan finished in April 2017.\n\nGrove Park is located along Hollowell Parkway, US highway 278. Grove Park is also served by MARTA buses that transport riders to the West Lake MARTA station and the Bankhead MARTA station.\n\nThe schools that serve the neighborhood are Woodson Park Academy, John Lewis Invictus Academy, and Frederick Douglass High School.\n"}

Typecast as one of several \"sexy blondes\", she was often compared, unfavourably, to the popular Diana Dors. Typical of these roles was a supporting part in the Benny Hill film \"Who Done It?\" (1956).\n\nBorn in Budleigh Salterton, Devon, Lee was signed to a film contract in 1954 by the The Rank Organisation after being seen performing as a student of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.\n\nShe made her film debut with comedian Frankie Howerd in \"The Runaway Bus\" (1954). It was directed by Val Guest.\n\nHammer Films promptly borrowed her to play the female lead in \"Murder by Proxy\" (1954), with Dane Clark. Guest cast her in a small role in \"Life with the Lyons\" (1954), again for Hammer.\n\nLee had small roles in \"Meet Mr. Callaghan\" (1954) and \"The Belles of St Trinian's\" (1954), the latter being a hit at the box-office. She had a good part in a thriller \"Footsteps in the Fog\" (1955), supporting Stewart Granger and Jean Simmons, then played a series of decorative parts in comedies: \"Man of the Moment\" (1955) with Norman Wisdom; \"No Smoking\" (1955); and \"Who Done It?\" (1956) with Benny Hill. She replaced Diana Dors in \"The Big Money\" with Ian Carmichael which Rank disliked so much they delayed showing it.\n\nShe was married to the photographer Cornel Lucas from 1954 until 1959.\n\nRank finally gave Lee a good chance, casting her as a nurse in a medical drama \"The Feminine Touch\" (1956). She followed this with a crime drama \"The Secret Place\" (1957) and \"Miracle in Soho\" (1957). She was an aristocrat helping Louis Jourdan in \"Dangerous Exile\" (1957), during the filming of which she was injured when her hair caught fire.\n\nBritish exhibitors voted her the 10th-most popular British film star at the box office in 1957.\n\nLee's first film in Italy was \"The Goddess of Love\" (1957).\n\nShe returned to Rank to make \"Nor the Moon by Night\" (1957) which was shot on location in South Africa. During filming, Lee left to go to Italy to visit her married lover. Italian newspapers reported that Lee had taken an overdose of sleeping pills. Three days later, papal prince Filippo Orsini, who had been linked to her by the papers, was reported to have been hospitalised after slashing his wrists. Police refused to comment on the newspaper reports linking the two romantically. Orsini, whose injuries were light, refused to tell the police why he had done it. Lee said that she had been suffering from insomnia and had taken an overdose by mistake. Both were married to others at the time. The Vatican said that Orsini would lose his title if it were proven that he had attempted suicide, and indeed the Pope did remove Orsini and the Orsini family from their hereditary title of Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne. Lee's contract with Rank was terminated and she relocated to continental Europe.\n\nIn Italy, Lee starred in \"The Magliari\" (1959), directed by Francesco Rosi. She went to Germany for \"Love Now, Pay Later\" (1959), and to France for \"Les Dragueurs\" (1959) and \"Marie of the Isles\" (1959). In Italy, she did \"Long Night in 1943\" (1960) and played the title role in \"Messalina\" (1960) and Cornel Wilde's love interest in \"Constantine and the Cross\" (1961). Her last film was the Biblical epic \"The Story of Joseph and His Brethren\" (1961).\n\nIn 1961, Belinda Lee died in a car accident near San Bernardino, California, on her way to Los Angeles from Las Vegas, where she had been acting in a film. Her ashes are interred in the Non-Catholic Cemetery (\"Cimitero acattolico\") in Rome, Italy.\n\nThe 1963 semidocumentary Italian film \"The Women of the World\" was dedicated to Lee with a written announcement at the start of the film (which interrupts the title music): \"To Belinda Lee, who throughout this long journey accompanied and helped us with love.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2218330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218330", "title": "Left SR uprising", "text": "Left SR uprising\n\nThe Left SR uprising or Left SR revolt was an uprising against the Bolsheviks by the Left Socialist Revolutionary Party in July 1918. The uprising started on 6 July 1918 and was claimed to be intended to restart the war with Germany. It was one of a number of left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks that took place during the Russian Civil War.\n\nThe revolt was led by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow. \nPreviously, the Socialist Revolutionary Party had supported the continuation of the war by the Provisional Government after the February Revolution of 1917. The Bolshevik Party came to power in November 1917 through the simultaneous election in the soviets and an organized uprising supported by military mutiny. Several of the main reasons the population supported the Bolsheviks were to end the war and have a social revolution, exemplified by the slogan \"Peace, Land, Bread\". The Bolsheviks invited left SRs and Martov's Menshevik Internationalists to join the government. Left SRs split from the main SR party and joined the Bolshevik coalition government, supporting the Bolsheviks immediate enactment of the Socialist Revolutionary Party's land redistribution program. The Left SRs were given four Commissar positions and held high posts within the Cheka. The Left SRs still diverged with the Bolsheviks on the issue of the war and were dismayed that the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk gave up large amounts of territory in Eastern Europe to the imperialist Central Powers. With the treaty, the Left SRs considered that the opportunity to spread the revolution throughout Europe had been lost. They left the Council of People's Commissars in protest in March 1918 and at the 4th Congress of Soviets they voted against the treaty. Although they continued to work in the Cheka, which played a decisive role in rebellion. Left Social Revolutionaries remained on the boards of the People's Commissars, the military department, various committees, commissions, and councils. \n\nIn Finland, where the soviet government had pledged by the treaty not to intervene, the landing of German troops significantly helped the \"white\" (counter-revolutionary) forces to crush the Finnish Revolution. In Ukraine, a puppet government, the Hetmanate, had been established with German backing. The forces of the Central Powers advanced through Ukraine towards Rostov-on-Don while Ottoman units made it into the Caucasus. In March, Allied troops landed in Murmansk and reached the Russian Far East the next month. In late May, clashes between the Russians and the Czechoslovak Legion began, and in June rival anti-Bolshevik governments were formed in Samara (the Komuch) and Omsk (the Provisional Siberian Government). The Left SRs strongly objected to the invasion and opposed Trotsky's insistence that nobody was allowed to attack German troops in Ukraine. Sergey Mstislavsky coined the slogan “It's not a war, it's an uprising!”, calling on the “masses” to “rebel” against the German-Austrian occupation forces, accusing the Bolsheviks of creating a “state that obstructs the working class\", moving away from the position of revolutionary socialism onto the path of opportunistic service to the state.\"\n\nA new surge of tension was associated with an increase in the activity of the Bolsheviks in rural villages, when the Bolshevik-controlled government announced, by decree, the enforcement of a state bread monopoly and the organization of \"food detachments\" for the compulsory collection of bread. On June 14, 1918, representatives of the Socialist-Revolutionary parties (both Left and Right) and the Mensheviks were expelled from the All-Russian Central Executive Committee by a Bolshevik decree. By this same decree, all Soviets of workers, soldiers, peasants, and Cossack deputies were also invited to remove representatives of these parties from their midst. Vladimir Karelin, a member of the Central Committee of the Left SRs, called this decree illegal, since only the All-Russian Congress of Soviets could change the composition of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. In early July, the Third Congress of the Left Socialist Revolutionary Party was held, in its resolution to the present moment sharply condemned the policy of the Bolsheviks:\nAccording to Richard Pipes,\n\nIn this situation of internal tension, on July 4, the 5th All-Russian Congress of Soviets began to decide the country's policy. The confrontation between the SRs and Bolsheviks was harsh. Left SR speakers fiercely attacked the policy of the Bolsheviks, from the requisitioning of grain and suppression of opposition parties, to the institution of the death penalty. They argued especially against the Bolshevik peace with imperialist Germany and the lack of defense of the revolution in Ukraine and Finland. Boris Kamkov promised to \"sweep food detachments from the villages.\" Maria Spiridonova characterized the Bolsheviks as \"traitors to the revolution\" and \"successors to the policy of the Kerensky government.\" The Left SRs also called for proportional representation in the elections of the Soviets, due to the sharp vote disparity between rural and city-dwelling workers. However, the Bolsheviks had sent a large number of delegates who were suspected of not being legitimately elected, simply to achieve a large majority in Congress. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had 352 delegates compared to 745 Bolsheviks out of 1132 total. The vast Bolshevik majority thwarted the socialist-revolutionary plans to change government policy in Congress, which was now firmly in the hands of Lenin's party.\n\nThis disillusionment felt by the Left SRs, the sense of danger in the face of the Bolshevik threats —embodied in Trotsky's resolution that allowed the execution of those who opposed the German occupation of Ukraine— and the conviction that a terrorist action could force the start of new hostilities with Germany led the socialist-revolutionary leadership to plot the murder of the German ambassador in Moscow. The SR's objective was not to challenge the Bolsheviks, but to force the Sovnarkom to confront the Germans; the left SRs preferred to achieve this through motions of congress, but, once this route was exhausted, the SRs resumed the decision to carry out the Assassinations. Knowledge of the plans was confined to only a few members of the central committee: neither the delegates of the Soviet congress, nor those of the party congress, nor the Cheka's lieutenant himself, Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich, received any communication about the resolution of the central committee.\n\nOn June 25, 1918, Count Mirbach informed his boss, State Secretary of the German Foreign Ministry Richard von Kühlmann about the deep political crisis of the Bolshevik government: “Today, after more than 2 months of careful observation, I don’t think I can make a more favorable diagnosis of Bolshevism: we, no doubt, are at the bedside of a seriously ill patient; and although moments of apparent improvement are possible, ultimately it is doomed.\" In May, he sent a telegraph to Berlin saying “the Entente allegedly spends huge sums to bring the right wing of the Socialist Revolutionary Party to power and resume the war... Sailors on ships... are probably bribed, like the former Preobrazhensky regiment. Weapons stocks... from weapons factories in the hands of the Socialist Revolutionaries.\" German diplomat Carl von Botmer also testified that the German embassy, beginning in mid-June 1918, repeatedly received threats that the Bolshevik security service had investigated, but to no avail. \n\nYakov Blumkin, a Left SR in charge of the Cheka counter-espionage section dedicated to monitoring the activity of the Germans, and Nikolai Andreyev, a photographer the same section, received an order from Maria Spiridonova on July 4, to carry out the assassination of the German ambassador in two days time. The day of the uprising was chosen, among other reasons, because it was the Latvian national holiday Ivanov Day, which was supposed to neutralize the Latvian units most loyal to the Bolsheviks. The Leadership of the Left SRs believed this assassination would lead to a widespread popular uprising in support of their aims. They claimed to be leading a revolt against the peace with Germany and not necessarily against the Bolsheviks and soviet power.\n\nOn July 6, 1918, at about 1:00 PM, a member of the Left SR central committee, probably Maria Spiridonova, handed over weapons and instructions to the assassins. Bliumkin and Andreyev hid the pistols and grenades in briefcases and drove in a Cheka car to the German embassy, where they arrived at 2:15 PM. They showed a letter of introduction, supposedly signed by the head of Cheka Felix Dzerzhinsky and asked to see German envoy. Mirbach believed that the Chekists were coming to inform him of a plan to assassinate him, a plan he’d been warned about earlier. During their conversation - at about 2:50 PM, Blumkin drew up a revolver and shot at Count Mirbach, Dr. Riezler, and the interpreter, Lt. Mueller, but failed to injure any of them. Riezler and Mueller took shelter under a large table, whereas Mirbach, who tried to escape, was then shot by Andreev. The assassins jumped out of a window while throwing grenades to create confusion; Blumkin fractured a leg in the jump and was injured by one of the embassy sentinels. The pair fled and disappeared in a car that was waiting for them in front of the embassy, heading straight for a Cheka HQ (under the command of Dmitry Popov) where the Left SR central committee was waiting. They made many mistakes during the assassination: they left a briefcase at the scene containing certificates in the name of Blumkin and Andreev, witnesses to the murders of Riezler and Mueller also survived. In the turmoil, they even left their caps at the embassy. \n\nThat same afternoon, Lenin had sent some of the few remaining forces in the city to the northeast, to try to quell the Yaroslavl uprising], which had just broken out. Only a few Latvian marksmen units, Cheka forces and some Red Guard and Army units (still in training), remained in Moscow. Lenin received the news shortly after, not knowing who had perpetrated the attack, and immediately went to the embassy to apologize for the murder and try to calm the Germans. Later that night, when going to give condolences to the embassy, Dzerzhinski indicated that the authors were socialist-revolutionary members of the Cheka. At the same time, the Foreign Commissioner, Georgy Chicherin, communicated to him the German demand to station troops in Moscow.\n\nA few weeks later, on July 30, the commander of German occupation forces Hermann von Eichhorn was assassinated in Kiev, by the Left SR Boris Donskoy.\n\nDzerzhinsky personally appeared at the headquarters of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Cheka detachment and demanded the extradition of Mirbach's killers. Accompanied by three Chekists, Dzerzhinsky began to search the premises, breaking several doors. At this point, the Central Committee of the Left SRs left the Congress of Soviets, which was taking place at that time, and began a meeting at the headquarters of the Popov detachment, where Dzerzhinsky discovered it. Dzerzhinsky threatened to shoot almost the entire Left SR Central Committee, announced the arrest of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Commissars Proshyan and Karelin and demanded Popov immediately extradite Blumkin, threatening to shoot him on the spot in case of refusal. However, Dzerzhinsky himself was arrested and taken hostage by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, to ensure the SR delegates to the Soviet congress.\n\nThe main armed force that the Socialist-Revolutionaries could make use of was the Cheka detachment under the command of Popov. This detachment consisted mostly of Finns and sailors, numbering about 800 people, and was armed with several guns and armored cars. However, Popov’s detachment did not take action, and the defense of the occupied positions was reduced to sitting out in two buildings of Trekhsvyatitelsky Lane. Subsequently, in 1921, during interrogation at the Cheka, Popov claimed that: “I didn’t take part in the preparation of the alleged uprising against the state, the armed clash in Trekhsvyatitelny Lane was an act of self-defense.”t\n\nIn total, during the mutiny, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries took 27 Bolshevik functionaries hostage, including the deputy chairman of the Cheka Martin Latsis and the chairman of the Moscow City Council Smidovich. In addition, they captured several cars, and a congress delegate Nikolai Abelman was killed. They also captured the General Post Office and began to send out anti-Bolshevik appeals. One of these appeals, declaring the Bolshevik government deposed and ordering \"not to execute orders of Lenin and Sverdlov\", according to the command of the Kremlin Bolshevik Pavel Dmitrievich Malkova, fell into the hands of Lenin. Another appeal stated that \"... the executioner Mirbach was killed ... German spies and armed provocateurs have invaded Moscow, demanding the death of the left-wing socialist revolutionaries. Frightened by possible consequences, as before, the ruling party of the Bolsheviks are following the orders of the German executioners ... Forward, workers, workers and Red Army soldiers, to defend the working people, against all executioners, against all spies and provocative imperialism. ” By this time, the leader of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Maria Spiridonova, who had come to the Congress of Soviets, had already been arrested by the Bolsheviks herself and also taken hostage.\n\nLenin thought that the whole Cheka had rebelled. According to the testimony of Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich, Lenin “did not even turn pale, but turned white” when he heard the news. Of all the units of the Moscow garrison, the Bolsheviks were able to rely only on the Latvian riflemen — all the other units either sided with the rebels or declared their neutrality. Trotsky’s order to units of the Moscow garrison to speak out against the rebels was carried out only by the Commandant Regiment and the School of Military Cadets, and the Commandant Regiment soon fled.. \n\nIn the midst of events, Lenin doubted the loyalty of the commander of the Latvian riflemen Jukums Vācietis and expressed his readiness to “accept his services” only by assigning four commissioners to Vatsetis. During the uprising Trotsky investigated four times whether Wacetis had joined the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. At night, Lenin ordered Jukums Vācietis to gather forces to launch a counterattack. By the early morning of 7 July, the Bolsheviks had gathered enough forces, mainly Latvian Riflemen under the command of Vācietis, to start their counterattack. At about 10:00 a.m., they set up their artillery only two hundred yards in front of the building where Popov's unit was located. After an unsuccessful negotiation attempt, the Latvians opened fire. The very first salvos hit the Left SR headquarters, after which the Left SR Central Committee left the building at once.\n\nLenin decided to demonstrate to the Germans that the Bolsheviks could control the Socialist Revolutionaries, despite having lost control of the local Cheka. Lenin accused the SRs of trying to overthrow the Soviet Government and charged Trotsky with crushing the rebellion who, in turn, put Ivar Smilga in command of the forces faithful to the Bolsheviks. For a while, Lenin, Sverdlov and Trotsky declared the Cheka dismissed, ousted Dzerzhinsky and put Latsis in his place, who was ordered to recruit new people to the Cheka. Trotsky ordered Latsis to arrest all the Left Socialist Revolutionaries serving in the Cheka, and declare them hostages. However, soon the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries themselves occupied the Cheka’s building, arresting Latsis and freeing the Left Socialist Revolutionary Emelyanov, whom had been arrested. Also unsuccessful was Trotsky’s attempt to prevent the rebels from seizing the central telegraph; the two companies of Latvian riflemen sent to them there were disarmed by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. For a short time the Left SRs controlled the telephone exchange and telegraph office. They sent out several manifestos, bulletins, and telegrams in the name of the Left S.R. Central Committee declaring that the Left S.R.s had taken over power and that their action had been welcomed by the whole nation. A telegram from the Left SR Central Committee stating that the Left SRs had seized power in Moscow, was sent to Mikhail Artemyevich Muravyov, a Left SR and Commander of the Eastern Front. On the pretext of attacking the Germans, he seized Simbirsk and tried to march his forces on Moscow in support of the left socialist revolutionaries. However, Muravyov could not convince his troops to oppose the Bolsheviks and was killed when arrested.\n\nThe leader of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries Maria Spiridonova then went to the Fifth Congress of Soviets, where she announced that \"the Russian people are free from Mirbach,\" and, jumping onto a table, started shouting \"Hey, you, listen, Earth, hey, you, listen, earth! ”. However, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries made no attempt to arrest the Bolshevik government, although they even had passes allowing them to enter the Kremlin without hindrance. In addition, the rebels did not arrest the Bolshevik delegates of the Fifth Congress of Soviets. Without attempting to seize power, they declared the Bolsheviks “agents of German imperialism” who established the regime of “commissar rule” and smeared all other socialists as “counterrevolutionaries”. Researcher Valery Evgenievich Shambarov draws attention to the passivity of military units that sided with the rebels: “The regiment of the Cheka, under the command of Popov, rebelled quite strangely. On March 1, their forces were armed with 1,800 bayonets, 80 sabers, 4 armored cars and 8 artillery guns. The Bolsheviks in Moscow had 720 bayonets, 4 armored cars and 12 artillery guns. But instead of attacking and winning, taking advantage of surprise and an almost three-fold advantage, the regiment passively \"rebelled\" in the barracks \". \n\nShortly after the assassination, Lenin ordered Yakov Peters to put under guard the whole Left SR faction of the Fifth Congress of Soviets (approximately 450 people). The Bolshoi Theatre, where the session of Congress took place, was surrounded by chekists and Latvian riflemen. Bolshevik delegates of Congress were allowed to leave the theater, while Left SRs were arrested inside the theater. Despite sympathy on the part of the Moscow garrison for the SRs, the Bolsheviks mustered enough forces on the morning of 7 July to storm their positions, thanks especially to the support of the Latvian Riflemen, who remained loyal to the Bolsheviks. In the Bolshoi, Maria Spiridonova and Andrei Kolegayev severely reproached Trotsky for their confinement and for the measures taken against their comrades. Trotsky responded by accusing the Socialist Revolutionaries of having risen to take power.\n\nAfter a vain attempt to stop the clash, pro-Bolshevik units attacked the SRs.The first assault, scheduled for 2:00 a.m., was a failure. Being a Sunday and a public holiday – St. John the Baptist's day - the troops assigned to the assault did not show up and forced it to be carried out the next day, instead of taking advantage of the night, as originally planned. The attack finally started at noon with the use of artillery against the Cheka headquarters, which was badly damaged by the explosions. Around 2:00 p. m., the revolt had been put down and the SR leaders had fled, abandoning Dzerzhinski in the building. Of the defenders, the assailants ended up capturing about four hundred. Aleksandrovich, captured shortly thereafter at a nearby railway station, was executed the same day. Popov and eleven other Chekists who had participated in the uprising were also subjected to execution without trial.\n\nIn Petrograd, July 7 dawned warm and sunny, the streets were filled with people. The press only picked up two lines about the murder of the German ambassador in Moscow, sent before communications with the capital were cut off. The night before, the few Bolshevik leaders who had remained in the city and had not attended the Fifth Soviet Congress in Moscow received the order to prepare for an uprising of the Left SRs and they immediately formed a revolutionary military committee. They decided to disarm the main Left SR armed detachment in the city, close down their main newspaper and try to arrest the local Left SR committee. They also ordered the formation of Bolshevik troikas in the different districts of the city, these were to neutralize and disarm the socialist revolutionaries of the respective districts. The Bolshevik authorities in Petrograd knew about the murder of the German ambassador before even the local socialist revolutionaries.\n\nMoisei Uritsky arrived in Petrograd around 15:00 on July 7 and immediately took over the leadership of the revolutionary military committee. He relieved Prosh Proshian from the regional Commissariat of Interior and accelerated the release of the Administration's socialist-revolutionary positions. Forces loyal to the Bolsheviks surrounded the offices of the socialist-revolutionaries in Smolny and closed them at 14:00, while the Socialist Revolutionary delegation of the Petrograd Soviet was arrested. Then the city's Social Revolutionary Committee, alerted to the likelihood of government actions to disarm and arrest his forces, alerted them and went underground. Ignorant of the Moscow events, local organizations were stunned by the instructions. Confused by the unexpected events, pro-socialist forces offered no resistance to disarmament and the only victims of the disarmament process were by accident, when a grenade exploded causing four deaths and fourteen injuries.\n\nThe only confrontation in the city took place at the School of Pages, where the scarce garrison, just 350-380 mercenary soldiers, most of them teenagers and without sympathy for the Left SRs, attracted to the building's guard by the better conditions than the front, defended the place. At 17:00, communications to the building were counted and they began to surround themselves, while government patrols began to walk the main avenues of the city The military committee tried unsuccessfully to achieve the surrender of the besieged. After a first unsuccessful assault, the talks between the two sides resumed, without ceasing the fighting. They attracted a crowd, curious to see what was happening in the area. At 19:00, new troops surrounded the building and brought machine guns; the main assault occurred about an hour later, using artillery and machine guns against the besieged. The shelling accelerated the defectors' defection. The fighting ended around 21:00 when the few remaining defenders hoisted a white towel from one of the windows of the building. After a surrender agreement guaranteeing the safety of the defenders, about 150 of them surrendered to the troops, who entered the building a little later.\n\nThe Bolsheviks immediately executed thirteen SRs that were in the Cheka, without trial, while keeping the SR Congressional delegation in prison and expelling its members from the executive committee. Little by little they released the bulk of the delegates. Those who opposed the uprising were immediately released, after their weapons had been seized. Thirteen of the four hundred and fifty delegates - including Spiridonova - were transferred on the morning of July 8 from the theater to the Kremlin dungeons; ten of them were released the next day.\n\nThe Communists tried to divide the party and alienate the militants from the leadership, by having some form two separate new parties. Most of the radical leaders who had advocated accepting peace with the Central Empire ended up repudiating the uprising. Those who, instead of criticizing the actions of the party, endorsed them, were persecuted by the authorities. Despite the flight of most of the leaders, some four hundred Party members were arrested and some of them executed. Spiridonova remained in prison in the Kremlin until the end of November. She received a one-year sentence, which was commuted by her admission to a sanitarium, from which she soon escaped. \n\nThe Bolsheviks began to expel SRs from the institutions and took their offices in Petrograd on the morning of July 7 after a brief fight, despite the fact that there had been no incidents in the city. The party's two main newspapers, \" Znamia trudá \" and \" Golos trudovogo krestianstva \", were closed and did not receive permission to resume business. On July 9, the Soviets Congress continued its sessions, without the Left SR delegates. It condemned the uprising as an attempt by the Left SRs to take power, approved the government's actions to crush the revolt and expelled left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries who did not condemn the actions of their central committee from the Soviets. Petrovski, Commissioner of the Interior, nevertheless ordered the expulsion of the Social Revolutionaries from all local soviets, independent mind whether or not they condemned the actions approved by the PSRI central committee. In Petrograd, Left SR representatives were expelled from the leadership of the Petrograd Soviet and from then on their influence over the organisation was null.\n\nMirbach's assassination was attempted, in vain, to force the Bolsheviks to resume the fight against Germany, once the impossibility of having a majority in Congress that allowed them to change the government's policy in a peaceful way was clear. Despite the government's accusation of the Left SR’s attempted overthrow of the Soviet government, the Cheka's own investigation in Petrograd ended without any evidence being found and with the release of those arrested.\n\nThe assassination of the ambassador led to a serious but short-lived crisis between the Lenin government and the German Empire. As the Bolshevik leaders feared, on July 14 the acting ambassador demanded the sending of troops to Moscow on the pretext of protecting the embassy, which would have placed the Sovnarkom under the control of the German high command. The rejection of the German demands, however, seemed to lead to a resumption of hostilities. The start of the Second Battle of the Marne turned German attention to the Western Front and allowed the government to finally reject the German claims in exchange for assigning a thousand Red Guards to protect the embassy, who would share the task with three hundred unarmed and plainclothes German soldiers.\n\nFor his part, the Latvian colonel Jukums Vācietis, who had led the assault on the Cheka headquarters in the capital under the command of the main forces loyal to the Bolsheviks, was appointed commander of the Volga front and, later, commander-in-chief of the Army.\n\nLeft SR members did not immediately disappear from the institutions due to a lack of cadres, which prevented the Bolsheviks from replacing them with their own supporters. However, they became part of the persecuted opposition, even groups that distanced themselves or broke relations with their central committee did not retain their previous power in the institutions. The increasing measures of repression against the SRs culminated in the trial of the party that began on . Of the fourteen defendants, only two were present, the rest went underground. All were sentenced to short sentences, but the party was removed from power. The uprising, which ended the alliance between Bolsheviks and left-wing social revolutionaries, was a milestone in the process of forming a one-party state. The murder of the ambassador, contrary to what the socialist-revolutionary leaders expected, frustrated their plans: neither did it bring about the resumption of the conflict with Germany, nor did it cause the expected uprising of the population against it, nor did it serve to bring the left-communists closer together; furthermore, the party was not prepared for the consequences of the attack. It served primarily to facilitate Lenin's removal of political power from the rival party. Despite its strong support in the countryside, the Left SRs never recovered from the repression suffered after the Mirbach murder and disappeared as a notable political option.\n\nThe \"Party of the Populists-Communists\" and \"Party of Revolutionary Communism\" split from Left SRs and supported the Bolsheviks. The Left SRs collapsed as a party by 1922 and only existed as small cells through 1925. Mirbach's assassins, Blumkin and Andreev, managed to evade capture. In early 1919, Blumkin was pardoned by the Bolsheviks and rejoined the Cheka. During the Moscow Trials in 1937, it was claimed that Trotsky, Kamenev, and Zinoviev were involved in this plot. Yuri Felshtinsky claimed the revolt was staged by the Bolsheviks as a pretext to discredit the Left SRs. However, this was disputed by L. M. Ovrutskii and Anatolii Izrailevich Razgon.\n\n\n"}

Franklin, produced by the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation, released by Metro Pictures, and featuring Anna May Wong in her first leading role. The film was written by Frances Marion and directed by Chester M. Franklin (brother of director Sidney Franklin), with the lead roles played by Wong and Kenneth Harlan. The plot was a variation of the \"Madama Butterfly\" story, set in China instead of Japan.\n\nThe film was the second Technicolor feature (after 1917's \"The Gulf Between\"), the first color feature made in Hollywood, and the first Technicolor color feature anywhere that did not require a special projector to be used for screenings.\n\nThe film premiered on November 26, 1922 at the Rialto Theatre in New York City, and went into general release on January 22, 1923.\n\nWhen young Chinese woman Lotus Flower sees an unconscious man floating in the water at the seashore, she quickly gets help for him. The man is Allen Carver, an American. Soon the two have fallen in love, and they get married \"Chinese fashion\". Carver promises to take her with him when he returns home. Lotus Flower's friends warn her that he will leave without her, and one states she has been forgotten by four American husbands, but she does not believe them. However, Carver's friends discourage him from fulfilling his promise, and he returns to the United States alone.\n\nLotus Flower has a young son, whom she names Allen after his father. When the older Allen finally returns to China, Lotus Flower is at first overjoyed. She dresses in her elaborate Chinese bridal gown to greet him. However, he is accompanied by his American wife, Elsie. Allen has told Elsie about Lotus Flower, and it is Elsie who persuaded her husband to tell Lotus Flower the real situation. When the boy is brought to see his father, Lotus Flower pretends he is the child of her American neighbors. Later, though, she confides the truth to Elsie and asks her to take the boy to America. She tells the child that Elsie is his real mother. After Elsie takes the boy away with her, Lotus Flower says, \"Oh, Sea, now that life has been emptied I come to pay my great debt to you.\" The sun is then shown setting over the water, and it is implied that Lotus Flower drowns herself.\n\n\nBecause the Technicolor camera divided the lens image into two beams to expose two film frames simultaneously through color filters, and at twice the normal frames per second, much higher lighting levels were required. All scenes of \"The Toll of the Sea\" were shot under \"natural light\" and outdoors, with the one \"interior\" scene shot in sunlight under a muslin sheet.\n\nOnce believed to have been lost, the film was restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, under the supervision of Robert Gitt and Peter Comandini, from the 35mm nitrate film original camera negative in 1985. As the final two reels were missing, Gitt and Comandini used \"an original two-color Technicolor camera\" to shoot a sunset on a California beach, \"much as the film's original closing must have looked.\"\n\nThe restored version is available as one of the titles included in the 4-DVD box-set \"Treasures from American Film Archives, 50 Preserved Films\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2218355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218355", "title": "Astronomia nova", "text": "Astronomia nova\n\nAstronomia nova (English: \"New Astronomy\", full title in original Latin: ) is a book, published in 1609, that contains the results of the astronomer Johannes Kepler's ten-year-long investigation of the motion of Mars. One of the most significant books in the history of astronomy, the \"Astronomia nova\" provided strong arguments for heliocentrism and contributed valuable insight into the movement of the planets. This included the first mention of the planets' elliptical paths and the change of their movement to the movement of free floating bodies as opposed to objects on rotating spheres. It is recognized as one of the most important works of the scientific revolution.\n\nPrior to Kepler, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed in 1543 that the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun. The Copernican model of the Solar System was regarded as a device to explain the observed positions of the planets rather than a physical description.\n\nKepler sought for and proposed physical causes for planetary motion. His work is primarily based on the research of his mentor, Tycho Brahe. The two, though close in their work, had a tumultuous relationship. Regardless, on his deathbed, Brahe asked Kepler to make sure that he did not “die in vain,” and to continue the development of his Tychonic system. Kepler would instead write the \"Astronomia nova\", in which he rejects the Tychonic system, as well as the Ptolemaic system and the Copernican system. Some scholars have speculated that Kepler’s dislike for Brahe may have had a hand in his rejection of the Tychonic system and formation of a new one.\n\nIn English, the full title of his work is the New Astronomy, Based upon Causes, or Celestial Physics, Treated by Means of Commentaries on the Motions of the Star Mars, from the Observations of Tycho Brahe, Gent. For over 650 pages, Kepler walks his readers, step by step, through his process of discovery so as to dispel any impression of \"cultivating novelty,\" he says.\n\nThe \"Astronomia nova\"'s introduction, specifically the discussion of scripture, was the most widely distributed of Kepler’s works in the seventeenth century. The introduction outlines the four steps Kepler took during his research. The first is his claim that the Sun itself and not any imaginary point near the Sun (as in the Copernican system) is the point where all the planes of the eccentrics of the planets intersect, or the center of the orbits of the planets. The second step consists of Kepler placing the Sun as the center and mover of the other planets. This step also contains Kepler’s reply to objections against placing the Sun at the center of the universe, including objections based on scripture. In reply to scripture, he argues that it is not meant to claim physical dogma, and the content should be taken spiritually. In the third step, he posits that the Sun is the source of the motion of all planets, using Brahe’s proof based on comets that planets do not rotate on orbs. The fourth step consists of describing the path of planets as not a circle, but an oval.\n\nAs the \"Astronomia nova\" proper starts, Kepler demonstrates that the Tychonic, Ptolemaic, and Copernican systems are indistinguishable on the basis of observations alone. The three models predict the same positions for the planets in the near term, although they diverge from historical observations, and fail in their ability to predict future planetary positions by a small, though absolutely measurable amount. Kepler here introduces his famous diagram of the movement of Mars in relation to Earth if Earth remained unmoving at the center of its orbit. The diagram shows that Mars’s orbit would be completely imperfect and never follow along the same path.\n\nKepler discusses all his work at great length throughout the book. He addresses this length in the sixteenth chapter:\nIf thou art bored with this wearisome method of calculation, take pity on me, who had to go through with at least seventy repetitions of it, at a very great loss of time.\n\nKepler, in a very important step, also questions the assumption that the planets move around the center of their orbit at a uniform rate. He finds that computing critical measurements based upon the Sun's actual position in the sky, instead of the Sun's \"mean\" position injects a significant degree of uncertainty into the models, opening the path for further investigations. The idea that the planets do not move at a uniform rate, but at a speed that varies as their distance from the Sun, was completely revolutionary and would become his second law (discovered before his first). Kepler, in his calculations leading to his second law, made multiple mathematical errors, which luckily cancelled each other out “as if by miracle.”\n\nGiven this second law, he puts forth in Chapter 33 that the Sun is the engine that moves the planets. To describe the motion of the planets, he claims the Sun emits a physical species, analogous to the light it also emits, which pushes the planets along. He also suggests a second force within every planet itself that pulls it towards the Sun to keep it from spiraling off into space.\n\nKepler then attempts to finally find the true path of the planets, which he determines is an ellipse. His initial attempt to define the orbit of Mars, far before he arrived at the ellipse shape, was off by only eight minutes of arc, yet this was enough for Kepler to require an entirely new system. Kepler tried a number of shapes before the ellipse, including an egg shape. What is more, he discovered the mathematical definition for the ellipse as the orbit, then rejected it, then adopted the ellipse without knowing that it was the same:\nI laid [the original equation] aside, and fell back on ellipses, believing that this was quite a different hypothesis, whereas the two, as I shall prove in the next chapter, are one in [sic] the same... Ah, what a foolish bird I have been!\n\nThe \"Astronomia nova\" records the discovery of the first two of the three principles known today as Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which are:\n\nKepler discovered the \"second law\" before the first. He presented his second law in two different forms: In Chapter 32 he states that the speed of the planet varies inversely based upon its distance from the Sun, and therefore he could measure changes in position of the planet by adding up all the distance measures, or looking at the area along an orbital arc. This is his so-called \"distance law\". In Chapter 59, he states that a radius from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This is his so-called \"area law\".\n\nHowever, Kepler's \"area-time principle\" did not facilitate easy calculation of planetary positions. Kepler could divide up the orbit into an arbitrary number of parts, compute the planet's position for each one of these, and then refer all questions to a table, but he could not determine the position of the planet at each and every individual moment because the speed of the planet was always changing. This paradox, referred to as the \"Kepler problem,\" prompted the development of calculus.\n\nKepler discovered his \"third law\" a decade after the publication of the \"Astronomia nova\" as a result of his investigations in the 1619 \"Harmonices Mundi\" (\"Harmonies of the world\"). He found that the ratio of the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of each planet's orbit, to the square of time of its orbital period, is the same for all planets.\n\nIn his introductory discussion of a moving earth, Kepler addressed the question of how the Earth could hold its parts together if it moved away from the center of the universe which, according to Aristotelian physics, was the place toward which all heavy bodies naturally moved. Kepler proposed an attractive force similar to magnetism, which may have been known by Newton.\n\n\"Gravity is a mutual corporeal disposition among kindred bodies to unite or join together; thus the earth attracts a stone much more than the stone seeks the earth. (The magnetic faculty is another example of this sort)... If two stones were set near one another in some place in the world outside the sphere of influence of a third kindred body, these stones, like two magnetic bodies, would come together in an intermediate place, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the bulk [\"moles\"] of the other... For it follows that if the earth's power of attraction will be much more likely to extend to the moon and far beyond, and accordingly, that nothing that consists to any extent whatever of terrestrial material, carried up on high, ever escapes the grasp of this mighty power of attraction.”\n\nKepler discusses the Moon's gravitational effect upon the tides as follows:\n\nThe sphere of the attractive virtue which is in the moon extends as far as the earth, and entices up the waters; but as the moon flies rapidly across the zenith, and the waters cannot follow so quickly, a flow of the ocean is occasioned in the torrid zone towards the westward. If the attractive virtue of the moon extends as far as the earth, it follows with greater reason that the attractive virtue of the earth extends as far as the moon and much farther; and, in short, nothing which consists of earthly substance anyhow constituted although thrown up to any height, can ever escape the powerful operation of this attractive virtue.\nKepler also clarifies the concept of lightness in terms of relative density, in opposition to the Aristotelian concept of the absolute nature or quality of lightness as follows. His argument could easily be applied today to something like the flight of a hot air balloon.\nNothing which consists of corporeal matter is absolutely light, but that is comparatively lighter which is rarer, either by its own nature, or by accidental heat. And it is not to be thought that light bodies are escaping to the surface of the universe while they are carried upwards, or that they are not attracted by the earth. They are attracted, but in a less degree, and so are driven outwards by the heavy bodies; which being done, they stop, and are kept by the earth in their own place.\nIn reference to Kepler's discussion relating to gravitation, Walter William Bryant makes the following statement in his book (1920).\n...the Introduction to Kepler’s “Commentaries on the Motion of Mars,” always regarded as his most valuable work, must have been known to Newton, so that no such incident as the fall of an apple was required to provide a necessary and sufficient explanation of the genesis of his Theory of Universal Gravitation. Kepler’s glimpse at such a theory could have been no more than a glimpse, for he went no further with it. This seems a pity, as it is far less fanciful than many of his ideas, though not free from the “virtues” and “animal faculties,” that correspond to Gilbert’s “spirits and humours”. \nKepler considered that this attraction was mutual and was proportional to the bulk of the bodies, but he considered it to have a limited range and he did not consider whether or how this force may have varied with distance. Furthermore, this attraction only acted between \"kindred bodies\"—bodies of a similar nature, a nature which he did not clearly define. Kepler's idea differed significantly from Newton's later concept of gravitation and it can be \"better thought of as an episode in the struggle for heliocentrism than as a step toward Universal gravitation.\"\n\nThe 2009 International Year of Astronomy commemorates the 400th anniversary of the publication of this work.\n\n\n"}

It is located on the Salzach River. It has a population of 5,408 as of 2011.\n\nMittersill lies approximately 25 km to the west of Zell am See, 30 km to the south of Kitzbühel and 27 km east of the start of the Salzach Valley in Krimml.\n\nMittersill straddles the Salzach River and one of its tributaries; the Felber. The town is bordered to the south by the Hohe Tauern mountain range, and to the north by the Kitzbühel Alps. \n\nIt has traffic links running east to west and north to south. The Felbertauern road tunnel runs south through the Hohe Tauern at an elevation of about 1630 m, providing a connection with Lienz in East Tyrol. To the north lies the Thurn Pass at an elevation of 1274 m, providing a connection with Kitzbühel and Tyrol.\n\nThere is evidence of a settlement in the Mittersill area during the Bronze Age in around 2200 BC. Mittersill itself was first founded in the 11th century as a part of Bavaria. Its castle was built in the middle of the next century.\n\nMittersill fell under the control of the Archbishopric of Salzburg in the 13th century and the castle became the seat of the archbishops in Upper Pinzgau. By 1357 Mittersill had a market town charter conferred upon it by the Salzburg Archbishop Ortolf, which boosted the town's profile considerably. By the 14th century it was acting as an important trade crossroads with salt, ice, and copper being taken south over the Felbertauern Pass (2481m) to Southern Tyrol and Friuli in northeastern Italy. Goods such as wine, fruits, velvet, and silks came north over the pass to be taken into present-day Austria and Germany.\n\nIn the 1525 German Peasants' War (\"Bauernkriege\"), Mittersill castle was burned down and subsequently rebuilt, giving it the appearance that can be seen today. In 1635 and 1746 the town itself was struck by fire and most of the medieval marketplace was destroyed as a result. \n\nMittersill became linked to Zell am See in 1898 and Krimml along the Salzach Valley with the opening of the Pinzgau \"Lokalbahn\" train service, which still operates today.\n\nA military school for an aerial tramway was founded in Mittersill in 1939. A subcamp of the Mauthausen concentration camp was located here during World War II. Construction work for a goods cable car across the mountain range started in 1943. Part of this cable car included two supports, each 280 m high; one was built of steel, the other was constructed of wood (the tallest ever in this material). As a result of the war, this aerial cable car could not be completed and both pillars were demolished in the 1950s.\n\nOn August 8, 2008 Mittersill received city rights.\n\nMittersill is home to two large industries, the Blizzard Sport factory, and \"Fahnen Gärtner\" flag factory, which provide jobs for the local people. It also has a fair amount of tourist business, attracting mainly skiers and snowboarders during the winter season and hikers in summer. Farming also remains significant with the emphasis mainly on cattle and dairy farming. A large tungsten mine is located south of Mittersill. The ore consists mainly of Scheelite.\n\nIn winter Mittersill is a popular destination for sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and sledding. \nMittersill has a connection with the Kitzbühel ski area through the newly built Panoramabahn cable car. It allows access to the Resterhöhe ski area, which in turn is connected to the ski areas of Kirch and the Hahnenkamm at Kitzbühel by the 3S Aerial Tramway; a structure with the largest span of its type in the world. \nMittersill is also close to other well-known ski resorts such as Zell am See, Kaprun, and the Zillertal Arena.\n\nMittersill is also located near the municipality of Bramberg am Wildkogel which boasts what is estimated to be (at 14 km), the longest completely lit toboggan run in the world.\n\nIn summer Mittersill has an 18-hole golf course and acts as a gateway to the Hohe Tauern National Park with its newly built visitor centre. Popular summer activities include hiking, mountain biking, and paragliding.\n\nMittersill Castle stands about 140 m above the town, The castle's story began in the 12th century, when the Counts of Lechsgemünd (subsequently: Mittersill) decided to establish their family seat. The current building dates from the 1525 German Peasant's War when the original structure burnt down. Thereafter the building was used as a regional court and centre for witch hunts in the Pinzgau region. The castle has been in private hands since 1888, hosting notable guests such as: Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard, the Shah of Iran, Clark Gable, Henry Ford, Bob Hope, and Aristotle Onassis.\n\nThe 900-year-old Felber Tower hosts a museum about the local area and its heritage, covering topics such as local history, geology, and mountaineering.\n\nThe parish church of St. Leonard originally dates from the 13th century, but has later additions, such as a 1420 stone sculpture of St. Leonard, a Baroque facade and onion dome, and an 18th-century high altar in rococo style.\n\nThe smaller church of St. Anna dates from the 18th century and is fashioned in the style of the Tyrolean rococo. Though originally a Roman Catholic church, it is used today for Protestant worship in Mittersill.\n\nSt. Nicholas church, located next to the Felber Tower, was built in the 15th century in the late Gothic style. The interior decor is 17th-century Baroque, with the exception of the side altar, which is rococo.\n\nThe Hohe Tauern National Park Center opened in Mittersill in 2007. It functions as a museum and centre for the Hohe Tauern National Park, with information about the geology, landscape, flora, and fauna found in the alpine region.\n\n"}
{"id": "2218382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218382", "title": "De motu corporum in gyrum", "text": "De motu corporum in gyrum\n\nDe motu corporum in gyrum ('On the motion of bodies in an orbit') is the presumed title of a manuscript by Isaac Newton sent to Edmond Halley in November 1684. The manuscript was prompted by a visit from Halley earlier that year when he had questioned Newton about problems then occupying the minds of Halley and his scientific circle in London, including Sir Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke.\n\nThe title of the document is only presumed because the original is now lost. Its contents are inferred from surviving documents, which are two contemporary copies and a draft. Only the draft has the title now used; both copies are without title.\n\nThis manuscript (\"De Motu\" for short, but not to be confused with several other Newtonian papers carrying titles that start with these words) gave important mathematical derivations relating to the three relations now known as \"Kepler's laws\" (before Newton's work, these had not been generally regarded as laws). Halley reported the communication from Newton to the Royal Society on 10 December 1684 (Old Style). After further encouragement from Halley, Newton went on to develop and write his book \"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (commonly known as the \"Principia\") from a nucleus that can be seen in \"De Motu\" – of which nearly all of the content also reappears in the \"Principia\".\n\nOne of the surviving copies of \"De Motu\" was made by being entered in the Royal Society's register book, and its (Latin) text is available online.\n\nFor ease of cross-reference to the contents of \"De Motu\" that appeared again in the \"Principia\", there are online sources for the \"Principia\" in English translation, as well as in Latin.\n\n\"De motu corporum in gyrum\" is short enough to set out here the contents of its different sections. It contains 11 propositions, labelled as 'theorems' and 'problems', some with corollaries. Before reaching this core subject-matter, Newton begins with some preliminaries:\n\n\n(Newton's later first law of motion is to similar effect, Law 1 in the \"Principia\".)\n\nThen follow two more preliminary points:\n\n\nThen follows Newton's main subject-matter, labelled as theorems, problems, corollaries and scholia:\n\nTheorem 1 demonstrates that where an orbiting body is subject only to a centripetal force, it follows that a radius vector, drawn from the body to the attracting center, sweeps out equal areas in equal times (no matter how the centripetal force varies with distance). (Newton uses for this derivation – as he does in later proofs in this \"De Motu\", as well as in many parts of the later \"Principia\" – a limit argument of infinitesimal calculus in geometric form, in which the area swept out by the radius vector is divided into triangle-sectors. They are of small and decreasing size considered to tend towards zero individually, while their number increases without limit.) This theorem appears again, with expanded explanation, as Proposition 1, Theorem 1, of the \"Principia\".\n\nTheorem 2 considers a body moving uniformly in a circular orbit, and shows that for any given time-segment, the centripetal force (directed towards the center of the circle, treated here as a center of attraction) is proportional to the square of the arc-length traversed, and inversely proportional to the radius. (This subject reappears as Proposition 4, Theorem 4 in the \"Principia\", and the corollaries here reappear also.)\n\nCorollary 1 then points out that the centripetal force is proportional to V/R, where V is the orbital speed and R the circular radius.\n\nCorollary 2 shows that, putting this in another way, the centripetal force is proportional to (1/P) * R where P is the orbital period.\n\nCorollary 3 shows that if P is proportional to R, then the centripetal force would be independent of R.\n\nCorollary 4 shows that if P is proportional to R, then the centripetal force would be proportional to 1/R.\n\nCorollary 5 shows that if P is proportional to R, then the centripetal force would be proportional to 1/(R).\n\nA scholium then points out that the Corollary 5 relation (square of orbital period proportional to cube of orbital size) is observed to apply to the planets in their orbits around the Sun, and to the Galilean satellites orbiting Jupiter.\n\nTheorem 3 now evaluates the centripetal force in a non-circular orbit, using another geometrical limit argument, involving ratios of vanishingly small line-segments. The demonstration comes down to evaluating the curvature of the orbit as if it were made of infinitesimal arcs, and the centripetal force at any point is evaluated from the speed and the curvature of the local infinitesimal arc. This subject reappears in the \"Principia\" as Proposition 6 of Book 1.\n\nA corollary then points out how it is possible in this way to determine the centripetal force for any given shape of orbit and center.\n\nProblem 1 then explores the case of a circular orbit, assuming the center of attraction is on the circumference of the circle. A scholium points out that if the orbiting body were to reach such a center, it would then depart along the tangent. (Proposition 7 in the \"Principia\".)\n\nProblem 2 explores the case of an ellipse, where the center of attraction is at its center, and finds that the centripetal force to produce motion in that configuration would be directly proportional to the radius vector. (This material becomes Proposition 10, Problem 5 in the \"Principia\".)\n\nProblem 3 again explores the ellipse, but now treats the further case where the center of attraction is at one of its foci. \"A body orbits in an ellipse: there is required the law of centripetal force tending to a focus of the ellipse.\" Here Newton finds the centripetal force to produce motion in this configuration would be inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. (Translation: 'Therefore, the centripetal force is reciprocally as L X SP², that is, (reciprocally) in the doubled ratio [i.e. square] of the distance ... .') This becomes Proposition 11 in the \"Principia\".\n\nA scholium then points out that this Problem 3 proves that the planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. (Translation: 'The major planets orbit, therefore, in ellipses having a focus at the centre of the Sun, and with their \"radii\" (\"vectores\") drawn to the Sun describe areas proportional to the times, altogether (Latin: 'omnino') as Kepler supposed.') (This conclusion is reached after taking as initial fact the observed proportionality between square of orbital period and cube of orbital size, considered in corollary 5 to Theorem 1.) (A controversy over the cogency of the conclusion is described below.) The subject of Problem 3 becomes Proposition 11, Problem 6, in the \"Principia\".\n\nTheorem 4 shows that with a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector, the time of revolution of a body in an elliptical orbit with a given major axis is the same as it would be for the body in a circular orbit with the same diameter as that major axis. (Proposition 15 in the \"Principia\".)\n\nA scholium points out how this enables determining the planetary ellipses and the locations of their foci by indirect measurements.\n\nProblem 4 then explores, for the case of an inverse-square law of centripetal force, how to determine the orbital ellipse for a given starting position, speed, and direction of the orbiting body. Newton points out here, that if the speed is high enough, the orbit is no longer an ellipse, but is instead a parabola or hyperbola. He also identifies a geometrical criterion for distinguishing between the elliptical case and the others, based on the calculated size of the latus rectum, as a proportion to the distance the orbiting body at closest approach to the center. (Proposition 17 in the \"Principia\".)\n\nA scholium then remarks that a bonus of this demonstration is that it allows definition of the orbits of comets, and enables an estimation of their periods and returns where the orbits are elliptical. Some practical difficulties of implementing this are also discussed.\n\nFinally in the series of propositions based on zero resistance from any medium, Problem 5 discusses the case of a degenerate elliptical orbit, amounting to a straight-line fall towards or ejection from the attracting center. (Proposition 32 in the \"Principia\".)\n\nA scholium points out how problems 4 and 5 would apply to projectiles in the atmosphere and to the fall of heavy bodies, if the atmospheric resistance could be assumed nil.\n\nLastly, Newton attempts to extend the results to the case where there is atmospheric resistance, considering first (Problem 6) the effects of resistance on inertial motion in a straight line, and then (Problem 7) the combined effects of resistance and a uniform centripetal force on motion towards/away from the center in a homogeneous medium. Both problems are addressed geometrically using hyperbolic constructions. These last two 'Problems' reappear in Book 2 of the \"Principia\" as Propositions 2 and 3.\n\nThen a final scholium points out how problems 6 and 7 apply to the horizontal and vertical components of the motion of projectiles in the atmosphere (in this case neglecting earth curvature).\n\nAt some points in 'De Motu', Newton depends on matters proved being used in practice as a basis for regarding their converses as also proved. This has been seen as especially so in regard to 'Problem 3'. Newton's style of demonstration in all his writings was rather brief in places; he appeared to assume that certain steps would be found self-evident or obvious. In 'De Motu', as in the first edition of the \"Principia\", Newton did not specifically state a basis for extending the proofs to the converse. The proof of the converse here depends on its being apparent that there is a uniqueness relation, i.e. that in any given setup, only one orbit corresponds to one given and specified set of force/velocity/starting position. Newton added a mention of this kind into the second edition of the \"Principia\", as a Corollary to Propositions 11–13, in response to criticism of this sort made during his lifetime.\n\nA significant scholarly controversy has existed over the question whether and how far these extensions to the converse, and the associated uniqueness statements, are self-evident and obvious or not. (There is no suggestion that the converses are not true, or that they were not stated by Newton, the argument has been over whether Newton's proofs were satisfactory or not.)\n\nThe details of Edmund Halley's visit to Newton in 1684 are known to us only from reminiscences of thirty to forty years later. According to one of these reminiscences, Halley asked Newton, \"...what he thought the Curve would be that would be described by the Planets supposing the force of attraction towards the Sun to be reciprocal to the square of their distance from it.\"\n\nAnother version of the question was given by Newton himself, but also about thirty years after the event: he wrote that Halley, asking him \"if I knew what figure the Planets described in their Orbs about the Sun was very desirous to have my Demonstration\" In light of these differing reports, both produced from old memories, it is hard to know exactly what words Halley used.\n\nNewton acknowledged in 1686 that an initial stimulus on him in 1679/80 to extend his investigations of the movements of heavenly bodies had arisen from correspondence with Robert Hooke in 1679/80.\n\nHooke had started an exchange of correspondence in November 1679 by writing to Newton, to tell Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence. Hooke therefore wanted to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others; and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, and then gave a whole list, mentioning \"compounding the celestial motions of the planetts of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body\", and \"my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse\", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items. Newton replied with \"a fansy of my own\" about determining the Earth's motion, using a falling body. Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the falling body would move, and a short correspondence developed.\n\nLater, in 1686, when Newton's \"Principia\" had been presented to the Royal Society, Hooke claimed from this correspondence the credit for some of Newton's content in the \"Principia\", and said Newton owed the idea of an inverse-square law of attraction to him – although at the same time, Hooke disclaimed any credit for the curves and trajectories that Newton had demonstrated on the basis of the inverse square law.\n\nNewton, who heard of this from Halley, rebutted Hooke's claim in letters to Halley, acknowledging only an occasion of reawakened interest. Newton did acknowledge some prior work of others, including Ismaël Bullialdus, who suggested (but without demonstration) that there was an attractive force from the Sun in the inverse square proportion to the distance, and Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, who suggested (again without demonstration) that there was a tendency towards the Sun like gravity or magnetism that would make the planets move in ellipses; but that the elements Hooke claimed were due either to Newton himself, or to other predecessors of them both such as Bullialdus and Borelli, but not Hooke. Wren and Halley were both sceptical of Hooke's claims, recalling an occasion when Hooke had claimed to have a derivation of planetary motions under an inverse square law, but had failed to produce it even under the incentive of a prize.\n\nThere has been scholarly controversy over exactly what if anything Newton really gained from Hooke, apart from the stimulus that Newton acknowledged.\n\nAbout thirty years after Newton's death in 1727, Alexis Clairaut, one of Newton's early and eminent successors in the field of gravitational studies, wrote after reviewing Hooke's work that it showed \"what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated\".\n\n\n"}

The main theme is the war between Angra Mainyu and Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrian theology which is an antique Iran religion. In Sasanies times the common language was mid-term Persian (Pahlavi) and Angra Mainyu was called \"ahriman\" in this language. At least after a thousand-year oral tradition, in twenty one-part Avesta which was probably written in B.C. 6, ‘angra’ means enemy, sin, bad and ‘mainyu’ (mainyêush, mainyô, mainyush, mainyû) means soul, invisibility, spiritual.

{"id": "2218400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218400", "title": "WorkChoices", "text": "WorkChoices\n\nWorkChoices was the name given to changes made to the federal industrial relations laws in Australia by the , being amendments to the \"Workplace Relations Act 1996\" by the \"Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005\", that came into effect on 27 March 2006.\n\nIn May 2005, Prime Minister John Howard informed the Australian House of Representatives that the federal government intended to reform Australian industrial relations laws by introducing a unified national system. \"WorkChoices\" was ostensibly designed to improve employment levels and national economic performance by dispensing with unfair dismissal laws for companies under a certain size, removing the \"no disadvantage test\" which had sought to ensure workers were not left disadvantaged by changes in legislation, thereby promoting individual efficiency and requiring workers to submit their certified agreements directly to Workplace Authority rather than going through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It also made adjustments to a workforce's ability to legally go on strike, enabling workers to bargain for conditions without collectivised representation, and significantly restricting trade union activity.\n\nThe passing and implementation of the new laws was strongly opposed by the left side of politics, particularly the trade union movement. It was argued that the laws stripped away basic employee rights and were fundamentally unfair. The ACTU, the peak association for Australian trade unions, consistently ran television advertisements attacking the new laws and launching its \"Your Rights at Work\" campaign opposing the changes. The campaign involved mass rallies and marches, television and radio advertisements, judicial action, and e-activism. The week of action culminated on 1 July 2005 with a \"SkyChannel\" meeting of union delegates and members organised by Unions NSW. The meeting was followed by a large rally in Sydney and events in regional areas. Individual state governments also opposed the changes. For example, the Victorian Government introduced the Victorian Workplace Rights Advocate as a form of political resistance to the changes.\n\n\"WorkChoices\" was a major issue in the 2007 federal election, with the Australian Labor Party (ALP) led by Kevin Rudd vowing to abolish it. Labor won government at the 2007 election and repealed the whole of the \"WorkChoices\" legislation by the \"Fair Work Act 2009\".\n\n\"WorkChoices\" made a number of significant changes to the \"Workplace Relations Act 1996\", including:\n\nBefore the commencement of \"WorkChoices\" the Commonwealth relied on the conciliation and arbitration power (section 51(xxxv) of the Constitution) which provides that the Commonwealth may make laws with respect to \"conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State\".\n\nThe Howard Government sought to bring as many employees under \"WorkChoices\" as was within its constitutional powers. It relied on the corporations power (Section 51(xx) of the Constitution of Australia) extending its coverage to an estimated 85% of Australian employees. All employees of \"constitutional corporations\" (i.e. trading, financial, and foreign corporations) became covered by the \"WorkChoices\" system. Other constitutional powers used by the federal government to extend the scope of the legislation included the to cover the Australian territories, including the external territories of the Christmas and Cocos Islands, the external affairs power, the interstate and overseas trade and commerce power, and the powers of the Commonwealth to legislate for its own employees. Victoria had voluntarily referred its industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth in 1996, under section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution.\n\nWhile one of the purposes of these changes was to provide a single national industrial relations system, in practice, each of the States' systems (except Victoria and the territories) remained in force. State industrial relations systems continued to apply to employers that were not covered by federal agreements (Australian workplace agreements or collective agreements), bound to a federal award, or were not incorporated and trading, financial or foreign organisations. Employers that remained in the State systems included sole traders, partnerships, incorporated associations which are not \"trading and financial corporations\" and state government bodies.\n\nCourt decisions may be required to establish whether an organisation falls under this definition; areas of contention include local government and incorporated associations that undertake some trading activities, such as not-for-profit organisations. There have been several test cases in state and federal jurisdictions, including \"Bysterveld v Shire of Cue\" and \"Bankstown Handicapped Children's Centre Association Inc v Hillman\". The general principles established by this case and similar cases since the introduction of \"WorkChoices\" were that the types of activities carried out by an individual organisation and the extent and value of these activities must be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the activities are considered substantially \"trading and financial\".\n\n\"WorkChoices\" contained provisions relating to both unfair dismissal and unlawful termination, which are separate matters. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) retained some of its role in hearing unfair dismissal and unlawful termination cases, but increased the emphasis on mediation and conciliation. It also reduced the timeframe within which employees were able to lodge such claims; claims had to be lodged within 21 days from the date of termination. Employees could apply for an extension of this timeframe, but a review of published decisions shows that extensions were infrequently granted. Fees applied for applications, at one time $55.70.\n\nBoth unfair dismissal and unlawful termination claims went through an initial hearing and compulsory conciliation conference at the AIRC. Only when the conciliation was unsuccessful and a conciliation certificate issued could the claim proceed to the next step. For unfair dismissal claims, the claim proceeded to arbitration by the AIRC, where a Member of the Commission could issue a binding decision. For unlawful termination claims, the claim proceeded to a court with appropriate jurisdiction such as the Federal Court or the Industrial Division of the Federal Magistrates Court.\n\nPrior to \"WorkChoices\", unfair dismissal protections existed in awards or through state industrial relation commissions. The changes to dismissal laws was part of \"WorkChoices\" which reduced the protections of previous unfair dismissal laws, which were introduced at a federal level by the Labor Government of Paul Keating in 1993. The arguments for these changes related to creating jobs by removing the burden on business of dismissing unsuitable employees. Arguments against the changes included the lack of job security for employees.\n\n\"WorkChoices\" introduced several restrictions on who was able to lodge an unfair dismissal claim with the AIRC. Unfair dismissal was defined by the \"Workplace Relations Act 1996\" (the Act) as dismissal which is \"harsh, unjust or unreasonable.\" Employees had to be working for a business that had more than 100 employees, and served a qualifying period of 6 months to claim unfair dismissal. Other reasons that excluded an employee from taking unfair dismissal action included where an employee was employed on a seasonal basis or on a contract of employment for a specified period or task, employed on a probationary period that was reasonable and determined in advance, a short-term casual employee, a trainee engaged for a specific period, or an employee not employed under an award or workplace agreement and earning more than $101,300 per year.\n\nSignificantly, the Act also excluded employees who were dismissed for \"genuine operational reasons or reasons including genuine operational reasons\". \"Genuine operational reasons\" were defined in the Act as \"reasons of an economic, technological, structural or similar nature.\" Interpretation of this clause by the AIRC had created precedent for a broad application of this section of the Act. In \"Carter v Village Cinemas\", the Full Bench of the AIRC decided upon appeal that an operational reason need only be a reason for dismissal, not the sole or dominant reason for dismissal. In another significant decision, \"Andrew Cruickshank v Priceline Pty Ltd\", Mr Cruickshank was employed at Priceline on a package of $101,150. He was terminated and Priceline subsequently hired a new employee in the same position on a package of $65,000–$75,000. Priceline claimed, successfully, that they had not breached the unfair dismissal provisions of the Act, as the dismissal saved the business money, therefore was for a reason including a genuine operational reason.\n\nUnlawful termination encompassed several parts; notice of termination, Centrelink notification, and prohibited reasons. Under Section 661 of the Act, employees, other than excluded employees (including casual employees with less than 12 months' regular ongoing service, apprentices) were required to be given a specified period of notice of termination or payment in lieu of this notice. Where this was not provided to an employee, an unlawful termination application could have been lodged. In certain circumstances where a business terminates 15 or more employees, the business needed to give written notice to a body prescribed by the \"Workplace Relations Regulations 2006\", currently Centrelink.\n\nProhibited reasons for termination included discriminatory reasons such as age, race, national extraction, political opinion, sex, sexual preference, religion, marital status, disability, pregnancy and family responsibilities; refusal to sign an Australian workplace agreement (AWA) (however, it was not prohibited to deny employment to a new employee who refuses to sign an AWA); being involved in proceedings against an employer for alleged breach of the law; membership or non-membership of a union or participation in union activities; and absence from work due to illness or injury, parental leave or emergency management activities. Unlike unfair dismissal provisions, there were no restrictions on employees who can lodge unlawful termination claims for prohibited reasons.\n\nPrior to the \"WorkChoices\" coming into force, certified agreements, subsequently called Collective Agreements (CAs) and individual Australian workplace agreements (AWAs), had to pass a No Disadvantage Test. This test compared a proposed agreement to an underpinning and relevant award that had or should have covered employees up until the proposal for an agreement. The No Disadvantage Test weighed the benefits of the award against the proposed agreement to ensure that, overall, employees were no worse off.\n\n\"WorkChoices\" required that employers provide employees with five minimum entitlements, which covered maximum ordinary working hours, annual leave, parental leave, personal/carer's leave and minimum pay scales. These five minimum entitlements were referred to as the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. However, the standard did not have any bearing on agreements that were certified prior to the commencement of WorkChoices: Notional Agreements Preserving State Awards (NAPSAs) if their conditions were more generous than what is provided for under the standard, those conditions will continue to apply.\n\nThose who supported the scrapping of the No Disadvantage Test claimed that it was too complex and argued that its removal would create more opportunities for unemployed people to be offered a job. The example of \"Billy\" was used in material supporting the Government's position. Unions and other groups opposed to WorkChoices claimed that Billy was a perfect example of why the new laws were unfair and would lead to bosses exploiting their workers.\n\nIn response to widespread criticism, the government introduced a fairness test to replace the standard. However, the legislation was not retrospective and so did not apply to agreements created between the inception of the original WorkChoices legislation on 27 March 2006 and when the Fairness Test became operative on 7 May 2007.\n\nPreviously, certified agreements, which were collective agreements about employment entitlements and obligations, made by an employer directly with employees or with unions, had to be lodged and certified in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC).\n\nThe new legislated changes transferred responsibility for overseeing the agreement certification process to the Workplace Authority, which had some of its other powers of investigation transferred to the Workplace Ombudsman. Now instead of appearing before a Commissioner at the AIRC, parties to a collective agreement were only required to lodge the agreement with the Workplace Authority.\n\nThis new process was criticised by those opposed to \"WorkChoices\" as they believed that it would give unions less opportunity to scrutinise and intervene where they believed an agreement had been unfairly drafted. However, the government stated in response that the intention of this part of the Act was to improve the turn-around time for agreement certification. In addition, the newly amended Act provided for substantial penalties upon employers, employees and unions where a collective agreement did not comply with the new regulations or included prohibited content.\n\nThe Office of the Employment Advocate, now known as the Workplace Authority, conducted a survey ending in September 2006 which showed the following results with respect to 'protected' conditions lost in \"WorkChoices\" legislation: of all AWAs sampled, 88 per cent abolished or 'modified' overtime rates; 89 per cent of AWAs either abolished or 'modified' shiftwork loading; 91 per cent abolished or 'modified' monetary allowances; 85 per cent abolished or 'modified incentive payments; 82 per cent abolished or 'modified' public holiday payments; and 83 per cent abolished or 'modified' rest breaks. In each of these cases conditions were more often abolished than modified, and all modifications represented decreases in conditions. Lastly, though 66 per cent of AWAs resulted in wage increases, 52 per cent of these increases were unquantified or not guaranteed.\n\nThe \"Workplace Relations Amendment (WorkChoices) Bill 2005\" (Cth) was introduced into the Australian House of Representatives on 2 November 2005 by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews. The Australian Labor Party claimed it was not provided with enough copies of the Bill when it entered the House and mounted a campaign against the Bill in the House throughout the day. During Question Time, Opposition members continually interjected while Government members were speaking, leading the Speaker (and later the Deputy Speaker) to remove 11 of them.\n\nOn the same day, the Senate referred the Bill to its Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee. The committee allowed five days for submissions to be made to the committee, with the closing date being 9 November 2005. Five days of hearings were scheduled to be held at Parliament House in Canberra commencing 14 November with the committee reporting to the Senate on 22 November. The decision to have a rather short inquiry was criticised by Labor, who claimed that it was an attempt by the Government to avoid proper scrutiny of the Bill. By 9 November, the Senate committee had received more than 4,500 submissions, of which only 173 were published on its website. The committee did not individually acknowledge and publish all submissions, due to the large number of submissions, at least partially resulting from the ACTU campaign against \"WorkChoices\", which included setting up a form on its website by which people could make a submission.\nThe Bill passed through the House of Representatives on 10 November and was introduced into the Senate later that day by Special Minister of State, Senator Eric Abetz.\n\nOn 14 November the Senate Inquiry began its five-day hearing—in which only a fraction of the submissions were heard—with the submissions of State and Territory Industrial Relations Ministers and representatives. The representatives were each allowed only seven minutes to address the Inquiry, during which they criticised the package as being unconstitutional and undermining the rights and conditions of workers. The Bill was passed, with amendments, by the Senate, by a vote of 35–33 on 2 December 2005.\n\nThe Bill received Royal Assent on 14 December and the parts concerning the Australian Fair Pay Commission, wages for school based trainees and apprentices, and redundancy pay for small employers came into force immediately from that date.\n\nThe Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations released the first set of regulations for the Bill on 17 March 2006 and following that the complete Act was proclaimed by Australia's Governor-General Michael Jeffery. The Act commenced on 27 March 2006.\n\nIn July 2007, a biography of John Howard said he pushed the \"WorkChoices\" legislation through in 2006 so it wouldn't be announced in an election year, and that several cabinet ministers expressed concerns that the legislation would disadvantage too many workers.\n\nThe ACTU's media campaign triggered a government counter-campaign promoting the reforms. Stage one of the government campaign preceded the release of the legislation and cost approximately $46 million, including advertisements from both the government and the Business Council of Australia, information booklets and a hotline. Government polling of the period August 2005 to February 2006, not released until March 2008, revealed that the government's advertising campaign failed to make workers less apprehensive about \"WorkChoices\".\n\nThe ALP, minor parties and the ACTU attacked the advertising campaign, with ACTU President Sharan Burrow describing the advertisements as deceitful party-political advertising funded through taxes. The Government argued that such expenditure is normal procedure when introducing radical change, citing the example of the GST advertising. However, that advertising was severely criticised at the time, and for the same reasons. The expenditure was challenged in the High Court of Australia by the ALP and the ACTU, in \"Combet v Commonwealth\", on the grounds that the expenditure was not approved by Parliament. On 29 September 2005 the High Court rejected this argument in a majority decision.\n\nOn 15 November 2005, the ACTU organised a national day of protest, during which the ACTU estimated 546,000 people took part in marches and protests in Australia's state capitals and other cities. The rallies were addressed by Labor State Premiers. Other notable Australians, including former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, also spoke in opposition to the industrial relations changes.\n\nA second national day of protest was held across Australia on 30 November 2006 with rallies or meetings in about 300 sites nationwide. At the MCG the entertainment included Jimmy Barnes and the crowd was addressed by such speakers as the leader of the opposition Kim Beazley. Estimates for the Melbourne crowd ranged from 45,000 to 65,000 people at the MCG and the march to Federation Square. In other cities, an estimated 40,000 people attended a similar rally in Sydney, 20,000 in Brisbane, 7,000 in Adelaide, 3,000 in Perth, 2,000 in Darwin, and 1,000 in Canberra.\n\nAs part of its campaign against \"WorkChoices\", the ACTU set up the \"Your Rights at Work\" campaign website, with more than 170,000 people signing up to receive updates about the campaign and the e-list also being part of the online campaign actions. One of the most well-supported campaigns was \"Take a Stand Barnaby!\", petitioning National Party of Australia Senator Barnaby Joyce to act on his concerns about \"WorkChoices\" and vote against them in the Senate in November 2005. Ultimately unsuccessful, the petition received 85,189 signatures, thought by the ACTU to be a record for an Australian online petition at that time.\n\nOther internet activism campaigns undertaken by the Rights at Work website supporters included raising $50,000 in five working days to erect a billboard on Melbourne's Tullamarine Freeway raising awareness of \"WorkChoices\". The online campaigns also targeted employers, like Darrell Lea CEO John Tolmie. In April, Mr Tolmie bowed to pressure and halted plans to shift his workforce onto AWA individual contracts after 10,000 Rights at Work supporters emailed him asking him to reconsider.\n\nAt the commencement of the WorkChoices reforms every state and territory of Australia had a Labor government. The States lodged a challenge to the Constitutional validity of WorkChoices in the High Court of Australia. Various union groups also lodged their own challenge in the High Court. The High Court heard arguments between 4 May 2006 and 11 May 2006. On 14 November 2006 the High Court, by a 5 to 2 majority, rejected the challenge, upholding the Government's use of the constitutional corporations power as a constitutionally valid basis for the WorkChoices reforms.\n\nWhen it was tabled in the Parliament, there was significant concerns from civil libertarians and the Opposition that the Bill was passed far too quickly for those voting on it to actually read the document closely, and that insufficient physical copies of the bill had been given to the Opposition to read before a vote was held.\n\nEmployer associations such as the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry had indicated they supported WorkChoices at the time, figures that ran counter to the 50 per cent of employers cited in a 2007 AC Nielsen poll as opposing the measures. The Australian labour movement, represented by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, ran a very effective media campaign attacking the proposed changes, and alternate models were proposed by the centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP), who won the subsequent election in a landslide. The Liberal (right-wing) Government at that time used federal funds to produce and air an advertising campaign promoting WorkChoices, a decision that which was criticised by the federal opposition and challenged in the High Court. In addition, the state governments of Australia (all of which were Labor at the time) used the High Court to challenge the legality of the Commonwealth using the Corporations power to sidestep the usual parliamentary oversight and implement WorkChoices, but were ruled against.\n\n\"WorkChoices\" was not a 2004 Liberal party election policy. However, following the 2004 federal election, the Liberal-National coalition held a majority in both houses of parliament, and amendments were introduced into the House of Representatives on 2 November 2005. A senate inquiry was held into the Bill from 14 November 2005 to 22 November 2005. The length of this was criticised by the Opposition as being too short. A survey by the Workplace Authority found that although most AWAs (Australian workplace agreement) removed some leave loadings, this was also accompanied by a wage rise in most cases. \"WorkChoices\" was passed by the Senate on 2 December 2005. The primary changes came into effect on 27 March 2006.\n\nIn December 2005, the federal ALP caucus formed an Industrial Relations Taskforce in order to investigate the adverse effects of the legislation, chaired by Brendan O'Connor, with special emphasis on the impact on regional and rural communities, women and young people. During 2006, the Taskforce traveled to every state and territory in Australia, convening meetings with individuals, employers, church and community groups and trade unions, collecting testimony in order to inform federal Labor's policy response and to publicise instances of actual exploitation. An interim report, \"WorkChoices: A Race to the Bottom\" was launched by Opposition Leader Kim Beazley at Parliament House, Canberra on 20 June 2006, and widely distributed.\n\n\"WorkChoices\" was a prominent issue in the defeat of the centre-right Howard Liberal government at the 2007 federal election. The centre-left Rudd Labor government dismantled the legislation in 2008, declaring it \"dead\".\n\nThe Australian Government stopped using the name \"WorkChoices\" to describe its industrial relations changes on 17 May 2007. Workplace Relations Minister Joe Hockey said the brand had to be dropped due to the union and community campaign against the WorkChoices laws. \"It has resonated because it has been the most sophisticated and articulate political campaign in the history of this country.\" The ACTU countered that the name may have changed but the laws were the same.\nThe Government did not rename the brand, but did launch a new advertising campaign that did not refer specifically to WorkChoices. This gave rise to the jibe from critics and commentators alike that the policy was one \"that dare not speak its name\", an allusion to the euphemism coined by Lord Alfred Douglas for homosexuality. Another notable curiosity was the continuation of the website.\n\nKevin Rudd took over the Australian Labor Party leadership on 4 December 2006, and in the process reaffirming his opposition to WorkChoices. As Labor won government at the 2007 federal election, it retained a federal rather than states-based system. Additionally, it planned to phase out Australian workplace agreements (AWAs) over a period of years with a preference of collective agreements and awards with an exclusion to those earning over $100,000. Unfair dismissal laws were to be restored to all businesses; however, employees joining companies with under 15 employees will be placed under a twelve-month probationary period. Restrictive right of entry rules in to workplaces for unions introduced under WorkChoices were to remain and secret ballots (rather than open ballots) to decide on carrying out strikes were to continue, which would become banned except during periods of collective bargaining. The dismantling of the group of industrial relations bodies created by the government would also occur, and in their place a service known as \"Fair Work Australia\" would be created.\n\nKevin Rudd used part of the 2007 election debate to argue that the Liberal Party was being influenced by the H. R. Nicholls Society to make further reforms to industrial relations, citing Nick Minchin's attendance to last year's H. R. Nicholls Society conference, where he told the audience that the coalition knew its reform to WorkChoices were not popular but the process of change must continue, and that \"there is still a long way to go ... awards, the IR commission, all the rest of it\". The Australian Labor Party stated that \"We know the HR Nicholls society supports the abolition of awards, supports the abolition of the minimum wage, supports the abolition of the independent umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission\".\n\nIn 2007, the Society criticised the WorkChoices legislation for creating even more regulation. The Society, which in fact supports deregulation of the labour market to the extent that employers and employees simply form contracts with each other and then deal with any disputes via the courts, admonished the WorkChoices model particularly for its length and the amount of red tape, claiming it was \"all about regulation\" and comparing it to the \"old Soviet system of command and control\", as well as on federalist grounds saying \"This attempt on his part to diminish the role of the states, to concentrate all power in Canberra, is very much to Australia's detriment\". Society President Ray Evans stated that in creating WorkChoices \"John Howard has assumed an omnipotence that Labor will inherit and to which no mortal should aspire. It will end in tears.\" Des Moore stated on behalf of the Society that \"The HR Nicholls Society is very disappointed with the work choices changes.\"\nHoward's successor as leader of the Liberal Party, Brendan Nelson declared that his party has \"listened and learned\" from the Australian public. He also declared that WorkChoices was \"dead\" and would never be resurrected as part of Coalition policy, and called on Rudd to move quickly to introduce draft industrial relations legislation. Former IR minister Joe Hockey said the laws \"went too deep\" but were introduced with \"the best intentions\". \"As I said yesterday and I've said since election day, WorkChoices is dead, and there is an overwhelming mandate for the Labor Party's policy of tearing up WorkChoices,\" he said.\n\nFormer Prime Minister John Howard broke his post-election silence in March 2008 by attacking Rudd's industrial relations policy while defending WorkChoices.\n\nIn March 2008 Federal Industrial Relations Minister Julia Gillard revealed that the previous government had spent $121 million on what she described as \"WorkChoices propaganda\" including promotional material such as 98,000 mousepads, 77,000 pens and 100,000 plastic folders.\n\nOn 19 March 2008, a bill was passed in the Senate that prevented new AWAs from being made, and set up provisions for workers to be transferred from AWAs into intermediate agreements.\n\nOn 27 March 2008, the ban on new AWAs came into effect in Australia. The date was chosen by Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard to have the law given royal assent as it coincided with the second anniversary of the WorkChoices legislation. \"On this two-year anniversary of WorkChoices, we are here to start burying WorkChoices,\" announced Julia Gillard. Brendan Nelson, Leader of the Opposition, made it clear that the Liberal-National Coalition will not seek to reintroduce AWAs, saying: \"I made it clear on behalf of the Coalition prior to Christmas that WorkChoices is dead.\"\n\nGreens MP Adam Bandt criticised the 2014 budget as allowing WorkChoices to make an \"insidious comeback\".\n\nIn January 2014, Liberal Prime Minister Tony Abbott distanced himself from senator Cory Bernardi after the latter called for more flexible industrial relations laws.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the son of Manolo Fábregas, a famous actor from Spain who established himself in Mexico, who also acted in Puerto Rico and whose birthname is Ricardo Sánchez Navarro. Sanchez Navarro is also the cousin of Manuel Sánchez Navarro, who in turn is the son of Fábregas' sister, famous actress Viviana Fábregas, his aunt.\n\nLiving around so many famous people, Sanchez Navarro grew up used to the show business world things around it, including nights spent at the television and film studios, interviews, and seeing his relatives on television much of the time, among other things.\n\nAs with so many star's children, Sanchez Navarro decided from very early in his life that he wanted to follow in his father's footsteps. At the relatively young age of twenty two, Navarro found a job with Televisa for the first time, playing a small role in the \"Secretos de Confesion\" (\"Secrets to Confess\") telenovela.\n\nSanchez Navarro struggled as a television actor early in his career: he did not work in telenovelas again until 1982's \"Por Amor\" (\"For love\"). In 1983, he found some success, as he participated in four telenovelas, \"Manana es Primavera\", (\"Tomorrow it Will be Spring\"), \"Cuarteto Para el fin del Tiempo\" (\"A Quartet Until the End\"), \"Bodas de Odio\" (\"Hate Wedding\"), which is considered by many to be a classic among Mexican telenovelas, and where Sanchez Navarro was able to have a feature character for the first time, as he played \"Dimitrio\", and \"Cazador de Demonios\" (\"Demon Hunter\", where Sanchez Navarro played \"Jose Luis\").\n\nFor the next three years, Sanchez Navarro would once again struggle, finding small characters in seven soap operas, including 1986's \"El Engano\" (\"The Lie\"). He would get his next feature character in 1988's \"El pecado de Oyuki\", (\"Oyuki's Sin\") which is also considered by the public and telenovela critics to be a Mexican classic. He played \"Orson\" in that telenovela.\n\nSanchez Navarro kept struggling after \"El Pecado de Oyuki\" was over, however. He participated in only one episode of 1989's \"Cita con la Muerte\" (\"Date with Death\"), and then he made small roles in three more soap operas, before playing \"Adolfo Degollado\" in 1991's, \"El Teatro del Horror\" (\"Horror Theatre\"). He followed that up by playing \"Rodolfo Olmedo\" in 1992's \"Lo Blanco y lo Negro\" (\"Black and White\"), and \"Renato\" in 1993s \"Valentina\", another hit telenovela.\n\nSanchez Navarro reached celebrity status when he played \"Santiago Ugalde\", a criminal millionaire and show business representative, in 1994's \"Volver a empezar\". In \"Volver A Empezar\", he participated alongside Yuri\" (who played \"Santiago's\" girlfriend), Chayanne, Eduardo Changerotti and Guillermo García Cantú, among others.\n\n\"Volver A Empezar\" became such a major hit, that it even spawned a soundtrack CD, where Chayanne, Yuri and Changerotti sang. The soap opera gave Sanchez Navarro fame in places such as Argentina, Puerto Rico, the United States, Israel and Russia.\n\nSuddenly a star, Sanchez Navarro was lured by an economical offer to move to Televisa's rival, buddying TV Azteca. He became one of that network's first bonafide celebrities when he signed a contract with the channel, and, towards the end of 1994, he recorded \"Peor es Nada\", which was also seen in Hong Kong, with the name \"Better Than Nothing\".\n\nSanchez Navarro has participated in about ten soap operas since then, although it can be argued that none have been as successful as \"Volver A Empezar\". Nevertheless, he keeps busy as a television and film actor as of 2018.\n\n"}

He built and administered 186 toll-bridges throughout France.\nAt the 1823 Exposition des produits de l'industrie française a model was exhibited of a planned suspension bridge which would span the Rhône from Tain-l'Hermitage to Tournon-sur-Rhône. The bridge, designed by Seguin, was completed in 1825.\n\nShortly after the Stockton and Darlington Railway in England opened (1825) he visited it and observed George Stephenson's \"Locomotion\" in operation and acquired two of his engines, which however proved unreliable in French conditions. In 1829, he delivered two steam locomotives of his own design to the Saint-Étienne–Lyon railway. These used an innovative multi-tube boiler and also prominent mechanically-driven fans to provide draught on the fire, rather than Stephenson's blastpipe. This boiler resembled the later Scotch marine boiler in some aspects, in that the boiler had a large single flue from the furnace, then many small-diameter fire-tubes returning to a chimney above the firebox door. Uniquely, Seguin's design also arranged the furnace in a large square water-jacketed firebox beneath the boiler to provide a large grate area and greater heating capacity. Robert Stephenson had also made the same decision with his \"Rocket\", but placed his firebox separately and \"behind\" the main boiler shell. Seguin's boiler enabled steam-engine trains to increase power and velocity from 4 miles per hour to 25 miles per hour, making railroad a more viable mode of transportation.\n\nInventor but also entrepreneur, teaming with his brothers, Camille, Jules, Paul and Charles, as well as his brother in law Vincent Mignot he continued his father's successful business in textiles, paper, gas-lighting, coal mines, construction and added to it a railroad company and a bridge construction business.\n\nMarc Seguin was voted into the \"Académie des Sciences\" in 1845, was made a Knight (Chevalier) of the \"Légion d'honneur\" in 1836 and an Officer in 1866, and wrote numerous books on the use of physics and mathematics in building bridges and locomotives engines.

{"id": "2218443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218443", "title": "Zuo Ci", "text": "Zuo Ci\n\nZuo Ci (), courtesy name Yuanfang, was a legendary personage of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period (169 – 280 AD) of China. Though he is known to be from Lujiang Commandery (盧江郡; around present-day Lu'an, Anhui), the years of his birth and death are unknown. It is believed that he had existed before the collapse of the Han dynasty, and it is claimed that he lived until the age of 300. He learned his magic and path to longevity from the Taoist sage Feng Heng (), and eventually passed his arts to Ge Xuan.\n\nZuo Ci studied atop Mount Tianzhu, practiced medicinal alchemy and nourished his vital essence by controlled breathing and Taoist sexual practices. It is said that he could live for long periods without eating. He was also learned in the Confucian classics and in astrology.\n\nThe \"Shenxian zhuan\" (Biographies of Divine Transcendents) says Zuo Ci was expert in \"fenshen\" multilocation, divination, the power of summoning the \"xingchu\" \"traveling kitchen\", and the practice of alchemy (Pregadio 2008: 1305).\n\nAt some time before 200, the local warlord Sun Ce, who was a strict Confucian, wanted to kill Zuo Ci and chased him on horseback. Zuo Ci, unmounted, still managed to escape by seemingly walking slowly.\n\nLater, Zuo Ci went to Cao Cao, who granted him a pension to do his magics. Cao Cao may have shown an interest in the Taoist approach to longevity by doing this, but his son Cao Zhi wrote that the pensions are only intended to keep the magicians and their wild teachings under control. Zuo Ci performed a number of magic acts in Cao Cao's court, such as catching an exotic fish from an empty copper pan, and teleporting far away to buy ginger. Zuo Ci once fed a whole court assembly with food and wine, but Cao Cao soon found out that Zuo Ci had emptied every wine shop in the region with his magic for this purpose. Cao Cao tried to execute Zuo Ci, but Zuo escaped by walking through walls. When someone reported that Zuo Ci had been sighted in the market, everyone in the market became identical to Zuo's appearance. Another report said Zuo Ci went to the mountaintop, so Cao Cao and his men went, and realised Zuo was concealed among a flock of sheep. Knowing he could not find him, Cao Cao announced to the flock of sheep that he was merely trying to test Zuo Ci's skill, and had no intention to kill him. At the moment, a goat stood on its hind legs and spoke. Cao Cao's men rushed to the goat, only to find the rest of the flock also turned into goats and started standing and speaking like humans. Zuo Ci was never found by Cao Cao's men again.\n\nZuo Ci eventually retired from the world to practise his arts in the mountains.\n\nAs described in the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", Zuo Ci was a Taoist known under the name of Master Black Horn (). The novel describes Zuo Ci's fictional attainment of Taoist powers and his subsequent mission to persuade Cao Cao to follow Taoism.\n\nZuo Ci wielded amazing Taoist power and was described as a psychic. He studied on Mount Emei in Sichuan, where he found \"The Book of Concealing Method\" (), from which he learned to \"ascend to the clouds astride the wind, to sail up into the great void itself;\" and how \"...to pass through mountains and penetrate rocks; ...to float light as vapor, over the seas, to become invisible at will or change [his] shape, to fling swords and project daggers so as to decapitate a man from a distance.\"\n\nZuo Ci offered Cao Cao the books if Cao himself became a disciple of Taoism. Cao Cao responded, \"Often have I reflected upon this course and struggled against my fate, but what can I do? There is no one to maintain the government,\" when Zuo Ci suggested Liu Bei and threatened Cao Cao, \" I may have to send one of my flying swords after your head one day\", Cao accused Zuo of being one of Liu Bei's agents, and threatened him. Zuo Ci openly mocked Cao Cao in court and Cao had him arrested; the guards beat Zuo cruelly, but the Taoist then fell asleep and slept soundly through the night. This enraged Cao Cao, who ordered Zuo Ci to be starved of food, this also failed as Zuo quite happily went seven days without food or water. After this Cao Cao could think of nothing else to punish Zuo Ci. When Zuo Ci appeared at Cao Cao's banquet, Cao tested him by asking to get, among other things, a dragon's liver, a peony, and perch from the Song River. Zuo Ci accomplished everything, which drew further suspicion from Cao Cao. Zuo Ci then offered a cup of wine to Cao Cao, who said that Zuo should taste first. Zuo Ci took a stick and divided the wine in half, and drank one half. Cao Cao was enraged.\n\nAs a result, Cao Cao ordered Zuo Ci to be executed, but Zuo had disappeared. Cao Cao sent his general Xu Chu to capture Zuo Ci, Xu saw Zuo walking among a flock of sheep and slew the flock, thinking Zuo had become a sheep; when Xu had left the shepherd boy who had been tending the flock heard one of the sheep's heads telling him to place the heads next to the bodies to bring them back to life, the boy did this and the sheep returned to life. After Xu Chu failed to capture Zuo Ci, Cao Cao put out posters calling for Zuo Ci's capture, and as a result hundreds of men matching the exact description of Zuo were found, and Cao ordered them all executed. When they were all executed black vapor rose from their necks where they joined to form another image of Zuo Ci. The image summoned a crane for him to sit on, and Cao Cao had archers to shoot him down. Suddenly, a gust of wind brought the decapitated corpses back to life. The reanimated corpses carried their heads and started to beat Cao Cao. Cao Cao fainted due to shock, the winds died down, and Zuo Ci disappeared along with the corpses.\n\nZuo Ci is featured as a playable character in Koei's \"Dynasty Warriors\" and \"Warriors Orochi\" video game series.\n\nIn the Shaw Brothers film \"Five Element Ninjas\", Zuo Ci was briefly mentioned in the film for being a founder of Ninjutsu with his Taoist arts. It was said that he used them to trick Cao Cao during his battles. This is referenced in another Shaw Brothers film, \"The Weird Man\", where he tricked Cao Cao with his sorcery and he was also Yu Ji's spiritual brother.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2218448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218448", "title": "59 Club", "text": "59 Club\n\nThe 59 Club, also written as The Fifty Nine Club and known as 'the 9', is a British motorcycle club with members distributed internationally.\n\nThe 59 Club started as a Church of England-based youth club founded at St Mary of Eton church in Hackney Wick by Reverend John Oates, in the East End of London, then an underprivileged area suffering post-war deprivations. The club was established to provide a place where young people could meet together and enjoy music and fellowship. It broke with the tradition of most church youth clubs at the time by allowing entry to all young people from the local community whether they attended church or not. Oates managed to persuade teen star, Cliff Richard to play at the Club's opening night on Thursday 2nd of April 1959, guaranteeing a huge turnout of young people and making the club an instant success. \n\nIn 1962 a motorcycle section was established, meeting once a week on Saturday evenings at \"Eton Mission\" where there was ample parking and a large hall with table tennis, billiards, a juke box and a coffee bar. \"Motor Cycle\" staff writer Mike Evans in 1963 reported: \"Ably managed by the Rev. Bill Shergold, the club is affectionately known by London riders as 'The Vic's Caff'!\"\n\nIt was notable, initially in the London area during the mid-1960s, for its adoption by the British motorcycling subculture known as 'rockers', who were at that time seen as \"folk devils\" at the centre of a moral panic in society. Its badge has taken on an iconic value for them.\n\nIt was started by Church of England curate John Oates, who went on to become the Canon of St. Brides in Fleet Street. Rev William Shergold started the motorcycle section in 1962 after a visit to the Ace Cafe, and it was later run by Rev Graham Hullet and Mike Cook. The club became an instant success after John Oates secured teen star Cliff Richard to play at its opening night on the 2nd of April, 1959. Sir Cliff Richard returned often to the club over subsequent years, and it attracted luminaries such as Dame Elizabeth Taylor, Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, and later many motorcycling sportsmen and musicians. Its trustees included Bishop Trevor Huddleston, the famous anti-apartheid campaigner. For British motorcyclists, it was famous for being one of the first places in the UK to preview the previously banned biker movie \"The Wild One\", in 1968.\n\nFrom 1962 to the early 1980s, the club enjoyed fame as the top hang-out spot for London rockers and motorcyclists, and overall it created a positive archetype for the young members to follow, in the \"bad boys made good\" vein. At the time, some rockers were considered folk devils, due to their clashes with scooter-riding mods (see Mods and Rockers).\n\nIn May 1964 the club moved from Hackney Wick to a church property at Paddington Green when Rev. Shergold moved to a new parish of St Mary on Paddington Green Church St Mary's in Paddington in the West End of London.\n\nIn March 1965, AP news agency quoted the membership as \"\"nearly 7,000, from almost every corner of Britain\"\". The club celebrated its third birthday at a function held at their two-storey church hall on 23 October, with a large iced cake weighing created by Arthur Keen and decorated by 'Jiminy' as a facsimile of Brands Hatch motor racing circuit. The hall was packed with 1,200 members and friends attended with some sleeping overnight and near to 1,000 motorcycles parked outside. At that time, \"Motor Cycle\" magazine quoted the membership at 10,000, further confirming the previous year's membership with the comment: \"That's well over 250 new members a month, if you care to work it out!\". The celebrations were concluded the next day, Sunday, when Rev. Shergold held a service at his nearby church.\n\nThe January 1966 issue of \"Motorcycle Mechanics\" magazine carried a letter submitted previously by a \"Charles Howe\", on behalf of the 59 Club, successfully applying for a free motorcycle, a vintage 1939 Royal Enfield v-twin donated by Assistant Editor Ian Speller, when the membership was quoted at 9,500.\n\nThe venue for the next function, the club's fourth birthday, was Alexandra Palace, allowing for 3,000 attendees on 10 December. The membership in September 1966 was quoted at 13,000, with a stand at the Earls Court motorcycle show to recruit further new members.\n\nIn 1969 the club was quoted as having 20,000 members on the occasion of a \"Write-In\" on 5 October, where members were being sent letters by mail and encouraged to contribute 1 pound (£) each, to raise capital needed to renovate their new premises.\n\nThe 59 Club attracted both male and female members and, according to Father Graham Hullet its success was based on its almost entire lack of rules. \nBesides motorcycles and 1950s rock and roll, the club involved activities such as football and sub-aqua diving—which gave the youths, mainly from underprivileged backgrounds, an outlet for their energy. Each year, the club organised ride-outs to famous winter motorcycle rallies such as the Dragon Rally in Wales, the Elephant Rally at the Nürburgring in Germany, and to the Isle of Man TT races. The 59 Club Barbeque still occurs every year at TT in Laxey, on the Isle of Man coast.\n\nTowards the end of its heyday, the club witnessed the birth of a very different type of motorcycle club—American-style outlaw motorcycle clubs, the rise of these groups, which tended to cater to an older, tougher crowd, was a contrast to the 59 way of life marking the end of the 1960s British Rocker sub-culture.\n\nThis was followed by a period when Japanese motorcycles outnumber the old British irons, The subculture would not see a resurgence for almost a decade, but the legend of the 59 Club carried on with original members who were determined to keep the spirit of the 1950s alive with the ageing Ton-Up/Rocker scene. \n\nThe Club relied on a new breed of modern Rockers on their newer bikes through the '80s and was very popular at its headquarters in Hackney Yorkton St. It has always carried its Rocker roots, with rock and roll still on the Jukebox as it is today.\n\nBy the late 1980s, a Rockers revival was underway and a number of enthusiasts started a 'Classic Section' within the club, a sub-group of members dedicated to upholding the 1960s rockers subculture (the style, music, and motorcycles), this again died away until recently, but the 59 has never stopped attracting a mixed motorcycling membership many of whom are Rockers.\n\n Rev Bill Shergold, remembered as being like \"\"a father figure that many of the boys never had\"\", was the president until he died aged 89 in Wells, Somerset in May 2009. \n\nAnother vicar, Rev. Graham Hullett, a keen motorcyclist, was Club Leader running the club from 1966 to 1970, developing an ideology that helped people from troubled backgrounds. \nHullet died in a Lincoln hospital in 2012, aged 80. he was interviewed for BBC Radio 4 \"Home Truths\" when he spoke of the club's heyday. \n\nMike Cook, who was a paid youth leader, retired from the club in 1992.\n\nIn 1993 the 59 Club moved from Yorkton Street in Hackney to Plaistow. Up until that time all the club heads were paid either by the church or the GLC but since then have managed the club on a voluntary basis.\n\nIn September 2009, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary service at St Martin-in-the-Fields church, Trafalgar Square, London. \n\nIn June 2018, the 59 Club appointed a new vicar, Father Sergiy Diduk, who opened a West London branch on the last Thursday of the month at All Saints Church in Hanworth, the first church set up by 59 Club founder Father Bill Shergold.\n\n2019 - The 60th anniversary of the club. The Bishop of London approached the club to offer the use of St. Pauls Cathedral to celebrate its diamond jubilee, with runs converging across London on the cathedral for a mass blessing and a remembrance.\n\n\n"}

It is situated 38 km south-east of capital city Trivandrum.\n\nThe Amboori village has population of 15,920 of which 4464 are males while 4785 are females as per Population Census 2011. The population of children aged 0–6 is 866, which makes up 9.36% of the total population of the village. The average sex ratio of Amboori village is 1072, lower than the Kerala state average of 1084. The child sex ratio for Amboori as per census is 977, higher than the Kerala average of 964.\n\nAmboori village has a lower literacy rate than Kerala. In 2011, the literacy rate of Amboori village was 92.37% compared to 94.00% in Kerala. In Amboori male literacy stands at 94.34% while female literacy rate was 90.54%.\n\nAn important ethnic group in the area is the Kanikar tribe; about 1200 members of this tribe live in the area.\n\nAmboori is from the Agastiya mountain peak where \"Sage Agastiya\", the founder of Ayurveda, is believed to have built his hermitage.\n\nAmboori is situated in the southern tip of western ghats, surrounded by hills and is near to kattakkada. South east of Amboori is the state of Tamil Nadu. It is surrounded by the grama panchayaths of Vellarada, Aryancode and Kallikkadu in the south, south-west and west respectively. The eastern part is covered by densely forested Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary. Amboori is well known for its high-yielding rubber plantations, however, the area also cultivates coconut, pepper, herbs, and medicinal plants. Amboori contains a plantation of holy Rudraksha (Eleocarpus Spaericus) trees. Adjoining Amboori is the Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary that is separated from the populated area by the catchment area of Neyyar Reservoir.\n\nIn the western hills of Amboori there is a large boulder called the \"Dravyappara\" (the treasure rock). It is believed that Raja of Venad, later Thiruvithamcore or Travancore, on his exile, spent his days on the top of this rock. There are 72 steps carved on the side of the boulder allowing one to ascend to the top. The height of the \"Dravyappara\" is approximately 700 ft from its base and approximately 1500 ft above sea level. There is cave temple in the top of Dravayappara.\n\nAmboori has witnessed a large landslide in 2001 which claimed the life of 39 people. The tragedy occurred when a hill collapsed on to a house where there was a family gathering.\n\nThere are many stories about how Amboori got it name. First one is that, the tribal settlers had a rice verity which will flower and ripen in a single day! It is called \"Annoori Nellu\". Later Annoori became Amboori. There is another story which is related to Chadachi Marthandan Pillai, who was a great archer of King Marthanda Varma. Once, the Chadachi Marthandan Pillai was participating an archery competition in a place called Ottashekharamangalam. He shot an Arrow (Ambu) which landed in a tree at a far away place. While removing (oori) the arrow from the tree, he has placed a special marking in it. Later the surrounding area has known as Amboori (Removed the Arrow). \n\nAmboori was inhabited by members of the Kanikar tribe since time immemorial. Around 1200 members are still living here with all cooperation to new settlers. During the year 1729, a princely state came up in the name of Thiruvithamcoor or Travencore under the rule of King Marthandavarma. The King had several enemies like \"Ettuveettil Pillamar\", who was trying to eliminate him. To escape from them, the King stayed in various places like Ammatha, Pathukaani, Kottamanpuram, and Meenmutty in Neyyar River belt. At that time, the Kani tribe was taking care of his safety and security. At a time, the tribe took him to a large boulder called the Dravyappara (the treasure rock), which is approximately 700 ft from its base and 1500 ft above sea level.\n\nThe King was very much pleased with the tribes courtesy and the way they took care of him. Before leaving this place to Tamil Nadu, the King has allotted the tribe an approximately 36000 hectors of land in chembu pattayam, totally exempting from land tax, this area mostly falls under Neyyatinkara and Nedumangadu Taluks, Amboori too falls under that stretch of land.\n\nAmboori became quickly famous after the Second World War. The princely state of Thiruvithamcoor or Travencore has experienced severe famine. Hence, the King has allowed Saint Thomas Christians of Kottayam region to settle in uncultivated Western Ghats ranges. The announcement from the King was resulted migration to this area in 1930. The new settlers used to walk from Kattakada to reach Pantha which is the early settlement of Christians.\n\nKochupuraykkal Kuryachan from Cheruvandoor, Punchaal Chacko, Thomman Mullankuzhiyil and Maylakkuzhi Kutty from Anikkadu, Vattanthottiyil Mathan Vaidyar and his brother Devasya from Mattakkara were the first one to reach this place.\n\nEven though they could start farming after clearing the forest, fighting with Animals and some local goons, they couldn't take it further with harsh nature and diseases like Malaria. Mullankuzhiyil Thomman died in July 1931 and he has been laid to rest at Mylakkara Church. Other people also lost their health and slowly they left the area.\n\nThe second migration started in 1932 when a group of 50 families from the central Travencore reached here. They stayed in Tree Houses and started farming. Tragedy stuck again in the form of Malaria. Many lost their lives and some left to better places. The families to stayed back had a real tough time in the middle of the jungle. Finally only 3 families – Mullankuzhi, Mylakkuzhi and Paranjattu was alive.\n\nAnother migration of around 75 families started in 1937 and ended up in 1944. The families spread from Panthaplavu to Karumamkulam area. Their experience was also not different. Most of them lost their dear once'. Finally, 13 families – including Chirakkathottil Devasya, Valliyanippuram Paily, Moonanal Families, Meeshouseppu, Muthiyamala Samuel, Puthenparambil Mamchan, Thuruthel Kunjouseppu, Kalayil Unnichettan- left behind.\n\nMost of the first migrators settled in a place called Pantha which has better water sources for farming. Patha is located north of Amboori and near Mayam. Even though most of the people are Catholics, they didn't have a priest to take care of their spiritual needs. Rev. Fr. Adeyadathos O C D (Muthiyavila Valyachan) has reached this are and started taking care of everyone without religious boundaries.\n\nIt is learned from the elders, that Fr. Adeyadathoos had miraculous powers. After he finished the house visits, the area was covered by a high wind and the problems with several diseases like malaria came to an end. The children born after this period was alive and started growing up. Before that, all the new born used to die.\n\nFr. Adeyadathoos has constructed a Church – St. Mary's Church in Mayam, which is the first Church in this area. Since, there was an order of the Catholic hierarchy that if any new church is constructed, it should have an educational institution as well, they have also started St. Mary's School in Mayam. This school also the first such institution in this area.\n\nHowever, the decision to construct a Dam in Neyyar River, forced the people of Pantha, mostly Syrian Christians, Pulayas and Parayas to resettle leaving all their lively hood. Most of them resettled in Amboori.\n\nBy seeing the new Gazette in 1949–50 to convert Amboori area into a fully agricultural sector, more families reached here and mostly was Christians. For the new migrants to stay temporarily, a shed has been constructed by Kottakkuzhiyil Joseph Vaidyan and the first Holy Mass was celebrated in this shed by Fr. Adeyadathoos. So, the history of Amboori is the history of St.George's Church too. Here it started after the final Holy Mass celebrated at Vettukallel Chacko's new house, celebrating Holy Mass at individual's house has stopped.\n\nTo have a new shed for the church, a committee has taken charge under the leadership of Thadikkattu Varki Mani as Convenor and Odalaniyil Thomas, Odanalyil Joseph, Nadackal Varkki, Kudilil Kuryakkos, Edathattel Varki, Pallithazhathu Chacko, Muttuchira Chacko, Karuvayil Mathew, Moonnanayil Kochu Varki, Vettukallel Joseph, Vettukallel Chacko, Karimbaniyil Devasya Chandi, Koolipparambil Mathayi, Kudilil Agasthy, Valliyanippuram Paili, Mundolikkal Joseph and V T Antony Vellappallil were members in this committee. The first church had 40 ft length and 20 ft widh. By this time around 85 families newly arrived.\n\nThe Church shed was also used as school. Kottur Kuriyakkos, who was appointed as Pastor in the Church was also started teaching here. Anchupankil Thomas, Kesari, Nadackal Abraham, Thekkel Philip, V A Joseph were also Teachers in this primary school.\n\nWhile taking survey of Amboori, it is learned that the property is belongs to Chennellikkunnel Uthuppan and to buy this property him was unsuccessful. He have not even listened to Fr. Adeyadathoos, who have put his time and health to develop this area. Hence the faithful decided to shift the church a new place which is bought from Pattani A Varkki Vakkeel, who had around 200 acres of land in Amboori. Half acres of land had been bought by Rs. 150/- and another half acres he had donated. A new shed also came up for school. \nIn 1955, Rev. Fr. Joseph Malipparambil has been appointed as the Vicar of the Church. Fr. Jacob Thottanani, Fr. Losious and Fr. Antony Puthoor helped him. Their combined effort has changed the face of Amboori. St. George LP School building has been completed. A new building for St. Thomas UP School has been erected and approval for the Schools has been received from Government. They also concentrated to develop nearby places like Arukani, Netta, Thekkupara, Dalmukham, Vavodu and Venuthadam. Amboori has got a Post office in 10-07-1955, Roads linking Kudappanamoodu-Koottappu-Amboori, Vazhichal-Amboori, Aanamukham-Amboori, Pantha-Amboori, Thekkupara-Amboori has been developed with help of all locals. During this time, Amboori also had a Library and Sports Club.\n\nIn 1961, under N E S Block, Perunkadavila a Health Center & Midwifery started here. In 1962, a private market established in Koottappu. The Amboori Co-operative Bank has started functioning from 29-03-1965. A Milk Society, Dairy Farm, Poultry Farm, Bee Farm and Bamboo Societies established during 1965–69 period by Fr. Antony Puthoor.\n\nBetween 1966–70, the U P School has been upgraded to High School, Federal Bank started its operation, Printing Press and Good Samaritan Hospital started functioning in Amboori. Electricity reached Amboori in 5.7.1975. Amboori became a Panchayat in 27-12-1975. In 1-1-1979, the first telephone connection established. The First Bus Service from Neyyattinkara Depot to Koottappu via Pantha and Amboori started in 19-5-1976. First Grade Electricity Overseer Office started in 4-11-1987, Village office started in 30-05-1986 and Veterinary Hospital started in 6-2-1987.\n\nSource: St. George's Church's Souvenir – 1988\n\n\nLegend has it that the poor citizens of Amboory used to get small loans from an unnamed goddess (spirit) of the \"Dravyappara\". A request for money was to be said aloud standing next to a large granite door on the northeastern side of the rock. On approval of the loan by the \"devata\", a granite bucket on the southeastern side of the door would be filled with the requested amount. The citizen was expected to remit the same amount in a reasonable time frame by dropping the money in the bucket and pronouncing aloud that the money was deposited.\n\nIt was an unspoken rule that no one should look inside the door; however, one day a young man, while returning the loan of his father, waited to see who the lender was. Eventually he saw a beautiful nude woman come out, take the money, and turn to go inside. However, as the story goes, she sees the young man and, instantaneously, the door of the \"Dravyappara\" closed forever with large thunderclap.\n\nSome villagers believe that one day the door will open again, and they perform pujas (worship rituals) regularly on the southeastern side of the \"Dravyappara\" where there are three narrow entrances.\n\nThe Kani Ttibe of Amboory have another legend in which one of the oldest devotees of the \"Dravyappara\" received a divine vision of a Devi (goddess) while performing his puja. She reportedly told him, \"I will open the door for you provided you can sow and reap the rice in a single day\" from a certain paddy field. However, the tribe has no conclusion to the story.\n\n"}

Though Fujiwara no Michinori and the Taira clan supported Nijō, Nobuyori and his Minamoto allies supported Go-Shirakawa's bid to retain some influence and power.\n\nWhen Taira no Kiyomori, head of his clan, left Kyoto for a time in 1159, it seemed the perfect opportunity for Nobuyori and the Minamoto to make a move; though some say Kiyomori left the city intentionally, luring his enemies into a trap. Nobuyori and the Minamoto attacked the Sanjō Palace, abducting the former Emperor Go-Shirakawa, killing much of his staff, and setting the building aflame. They brought him to the Great Palace, where Emperor Nijō was being held hostage as well. They then moved on to the home of chief-councillor Fujiwara no Michinori, killing everyone there; Michinori escaped, only to be captured and decapitated soon afterwards. Nobuyori then had Nijō appoint him Chancellor, under duress. Though he still had enemies at Court who encouraged the emperor to resist and to escape, overall Nobuyori's plan had succeeded.\n\nThis did not last for long, however, since Taira no Kiyomori returned, and the Minamoto were not sufficiently prepared to defend the city against him. The emperor and ex-emperor both were freed, the Minamoto defeated, and Nobuyori killed in February 1160.\n\nNear the end of the rebellion, Fujiwara no Nobuyuri was beheaded.\n\n"}

{"id": "2218459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218459", "title": "Pan-nationalism", "text": "Pan-nationalism\n\nPan-nationalism (from / \"all\", and / \"nationalism\") is a specific term, used mainly in social sciences as a designation for those forms of nationalism that are trying to transcend (overcome) traditional boundaries of basic national identities, in order to create a \"higher\" pan-national (all-inclusive) identity, based on various common denominators. Pan-nationalism can occur as a specific variant of all common forms of nationalism. In relation to classical state nationalism, pan-nationalism manifests itself through various political movements that are advocating the creation of \"higher\" (pan-national) forms of political identity, based on a regional or continental grouping of national states (for examples: Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism), Pan-Arabism, Pan-Iranism. In terms of ethnic nationalism, pan-nationalism can also manifest itself through specific ethnic movements that are advocating the creation of \"higher\" (pan-national) forms of common identity that is based on ethnic grouping (for example: Pan-Germanism or Pan-Slavism). Other forms of nationalism also have their \"pan-national\" variants.\n\nSome forms of pan-nationalism, such as Pan-Germanism, manifest themselves on two levels: wider - relating to the unity of all Germanic peoples - and narrower - relating to the unity of all ethnic Germans, also including (on either of those two levels) German-speaking Austrians and German-speaking Swiss people, many of who may not identify as strictly \"German\", while still belonging to the wider family of Germanic peoples. Another example is Pan-Turkism, who show deep contempt as well as acts of racism against peoples separate national or ethnic identities of the non-Turkish peoples, mainly against Greeks, Armenians and Kurds where the tensions as well include the question of Armenian Genocide.\nPan-nationalism emerged from the nineteenth-century European nationalism, beginning with the Pan-Slavism movement, which developed among various Slavic nations within the Austro-Hungarian and Turkish empires. At the heart of this development was Ján Kollár, who maintained that the Slavs as a fundamentally single people, sharing the same cultural heritage. This was later followed by the Pan-German thought, which assumed a somewhat similar view, with a goal of German unification where a greater Germany can be created, including Austrians and other German speakers. These pan-nationalistic movements embraced the European intellectual discourses on race particularly those about the preservation of the racial unit. This gave the concept a mantle of permanence because it called upon a biological connection that bound a \"Volk\" together. \n\nPan-nationalism implies that the national group is dispersed over several existing states. It is not identical to irredentism – nationalist claims on adjoining territories on the grounds that they form part of the national homeland. Scale is a factor here, however. Greater Albania, even in the largest version, would still be a small country. An irredentist Greater Germany, even if it is limited to contiguous German-speaking regions, would have about 100 million inhabitants. Pan-nationalism is not the same as diaspora nationalism, such as Zionism, which implies the concentration of a dispersed group on an ancestral homeland. Colonies (other than settler colonies) fall outside most definitions of a nation, since both coloniser and colonised recognise that they share no ethnicity, culture, and language. \n\nNationalist movements in large nations, such as the German and Russian nations, are therefore difficult to distinguish from pan-nationalist movements, and often there are explicitly pan-nationalist elements. Aside from these cases, however, most pan-nationalist movements failed. Specifically pan-national states are rare. Yugoslavia attempted to unify a category of South Slavs, the prefix \"jugo\" means \"south\". After 1945, it did recognise separate internal nations, with their own governments.\n\nOther large states are difficult to classify as pan-national. Around 1942 Nazi Germany controlled a vast collection of annexed territories, German-administered civilian entities, puppet states, collaborationist states, and front-line areas run by the military. The conquests were partly inspired by the idea of Lebensraum, but that is not in itself a pan-nationalist concept. The Soviet Union had a Soviet identity, but no \"Soviet\" ethnicity, culture, or language. It was influenced by pan-Russian ideas, but also by other geopolitical ideals which implied a large territory. China has a long tradition of cultural and administrative unity. (The fact that both China and India annexed territories does not necessarily make the state pan-national in character.)\n\nThe general failure of the pan-nationalist movements is illustrated by several examples, which had a clear idea of their ideal state, but never got anywhere near achieving it. Modern Turkey is the former core area of the Ottoman Empire. The present state is closely modelled on the classic European nation state, and was a deliberate break with that empire. Beside the very strong Turkish nationalism there are three pan-nationalisms. In ascending order of scale: pan-Turkism, a sometimes distinct pan-Turkic ideology referring to the Turkic peoples, and pan-Turanism, which covers most of central Asia and even Finland and Hungary. As in Turkey, pan-nationalist movements often operate on the margin of a more limited \"standard-nationalist\" movement, in the existing core area of the claimed mega-state.\n\nPan-Slavism is another notable example of an influential ideal that never resulted in the corresponding mega-state – if Russian territory was included, it would extend from the Baltic to the Pacific (west to east) and right down to central Asia and the Caucasus/Black Sea/Mediterranean in the south.\n\nPan-Americanism as an ideal was influential around the time of the independence movements in Latin America. However, the new nation-states soon diverged in policy and interests, and no federation emerged. The term acquired another meaning, namely U.S.-led co-operation among the separate nation-states, with a connotation of U.S. hegemony. That is why there is a pan-Latin-Americanism which proposes inter-Americanism with the United States. An important exponent of this philosophy is Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, from Peru, while Bolivarianism represents a current variation on the theme.\n\nPan-Arabism favors the unification of the countries of the Arab world, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Sea. Unlike most traditional pan-nationalist movements in Europe, this is not based on race or ethnicity because it has been revitalised with religion at its core.\n\nThomas Hegghammer of the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment has outlined the emergence of \"macro-nationalism\" in the late Cold War era, which kept a low profile until the September 11 attacks. Hegghammer traces the origins of modern macro-nationalism to both the Western counter-jihad movement and Islamist terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda. In the aftermath of the 2011 Norway attacks, he described the ideologies of perpetrator Anders Behring Breivik as \"not fitting the established categories of right-wing ideology, like white supremacism, ultranationalism or Christian fundamentalism\", but more akin to a \"doctrine of civilisational war that represents the closest thing yet to a Christian version of Al-Qaeda\".\n"}

He attended the Ringling School of Art in 1967, and after graduation worked at the Migrant Education Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nZeck began his comics career in 1974, doing illustration assignments for the text stories in Charlton Comics' animated line of comics, which led to work on their horror titles. During this period he lived briefly in the Derby, Connecticut, area where Charlton was headquartered.\n\nIn 1977, Zeck started working for Marvel Comics on \"Master of Kung Fu\" with writer Doug Moench. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Moench and Zeck's work on \"Master of Kung-Fu\" sixth on its list of the \"Top 10 1970s Marvels\". Zeck later worked on \"Captain America\" and drew covers for \"\".\n\nZeck illustrated the \"Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars\" limited series in 1984. For this series, he designed a new black-and-white costume temporarily worn by Spider-Man. The plot that developed as a result of Spider-Man's acquisition of the costume led to the creation of the Spider-Man villain known as Venom.\n\nIn 1986, Zeck collaborated with writer Steven Grant on a \"Punisher\" miniseries which was later collected as \"The Punisher: Circle Of Blood\" and an original hardcover graphic novel of the character three years later.\n\nZeck illustrated the 1987 Spider-Man storyline \"Kraven's Last Hunt\", written by his former \"Captain America\" collaborator J. M. DeMatteis, which is considered to be one of the quintessential stories in Spider-Man's history, as well as the definitive Kraven the Hunter storyline. DeMatteis remarked, \"Because Mike nailed the plot elements so perfectly in his pencils—every action, every emotion, was there, clear as a bell—I didn’t have to worry about belaboring those elements in the captions or dialogue. I was free to do those interior monologues that were so important to the story. If any other artist had drawn “Kraven’s Last Hunt” ... it wouldn't have been the same story.\" In 2004, Zeck's cover of \"Web of Spider-Man\" #32, which depicts Spider-Man escaping the grave into which he has been interred by Kraven, was recreated as a 12-inch tall resin diorama statue by Dynamic Forces.\n\nZeck has worked for DC Comics as well. He contributed to \"Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe\" in the mid-1980s. Zeck drew the covers for the \"Ten Nights of the Beast\" storyline in \"Batman\" #417–420 (March–June 1988) and these covers were later collected in a portfolio. His other credits for the publisher include \"\", \"Legends of the DC Universe\", and \"Deathstroke, The Terminator\". In 1999, he collaborated with writer Mark Waid on \"The Kingdom\" (illustrating issue #2, with Ariel Olivetti illustrating issue #1), a sequel to \"Kingdom Come\".\n\n\n"}

It was used for educational discipline, primarily in Scotland, but also in schools in the English cities of Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, Manchester and Walsall.\n\nA tawse consists of a strip of leather, with one end split into a number of tails. The thickness of the leather and the number of tails is variable. Many Scottish saddlers made tawses for local schoolmasters. The official name \"tawse\" was hardly ever used in conversation by either teachers or pupils, who instead referred to it as either the school strap or the belt, the normal term for an unforked implement, as worn in trousers (see belt).\n\nScottish public (state) schools used the tawse to punish pupils of either sex on the palm of the outstretched hand. Pupils were usually instructed to hold out one hand, palm uppermost, supported by the other hand below, which made it difficult to move the hand away during the infliction of the strokes. It also ensured that the full force of each stroke was taken by the hand being strapped. The punishment was usually inflicted by the class teacher in front of the entire class, to act as a deterrent to others; sometimes by a designated teacher, such as the Deputy Headmaster, to whom the pupil was sent.\n\nThis was wielded in primary as well as secondary schools for both trivial and serious offences, and girls got belted as well as boys. Nearly 6 in 10 girls were strapped in school. \n\nIn Walsall and Gateshead, and in some schools in Manchester and Nottingham, students (mainly male) were tawsed on the seat of the trousers.\n\nSome Scottish private (independent) schools also used the tawse, such as Keil School and St Aloysius' College, Glasgow, but others such as Fettes College used the cane instead, as did most schools in England outside the north-east.\n\nIn 1982 two Scottish mothers went to the European Court of Human Rights, who passed a judgment that parents had the right to refuse corporal punishment of a child. This judgement led indirectly to the use of the tawse (and all other forms of corporal punishment) being banned by law in UK state schools. The legislation came into force in 1987, but most Scottish local education authorities had already abolished it by the early 1980s.\n\nJohn J. Dick Leather Goods was a manufacturer in Lochgelly estimated to have made around 70% of tawses when they were used in schools. Original tawses sold for around £6 in 1982 but twenty years later some collectors were paying hundred of pounds each for rare items.\n\nThe tawse was also used for judicial corporal punishment in Scotland as an alternative to the more usual birch. Courts could sentence boys of over 14 but under 16 to up to 36 strokes with an extra-heavy tawse for any offence. This was administered to the offender's bare buttocks. Judicial corporal punishment was abolished in 1948.\n\n\n"}

In her junior year of high school, she was expelled for becoming pregnant with her son. After expulsion, she attended A.A. Wright Junior College and later won a scholarship to the University of Chicago (U of C). She graduated from U of C with a bachelors in 1962, a masters in 1965 and a doctorate in 1969. Her dissertation, \"Patterns of World and Leisure: An Investigation of the Relationships between Childhood and Current Styles of Leisure and Current Work Behavior among Young Women Graduates in the Field of Public Education\" was supervised by Alice Rossi.\n\nHacker worked for Rossi, Phil Stone and Fred Stodtbeck as a research assistant at the U of C and also at Harvard University. In the late 1960s she worked as a clinical instructor in psychiatry for the Baylor University College of Medicine and as a staff sociologist at the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences in Houston. In the 1970s, she studied women and technology at AT&T (Bell Company.) Her research found that while AT&T claimed to promote hiring initiatives for minorities and women, the reality was that women and minorities were hired mainly for jobs \"next to be automated.\"\n\nFrom 1971 to 1976, she was an assistant professor of sociology at Drake University. While in Iowa, Hacker and her husband, Barton Hacker, founded the Des Moines chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW).\n\nHacker went on to attend engineering classes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and architecture classes at the Linn-Benton Community College in order to better understand technology and its relationship to gender stratification. While at MIT, Hacker explored students' reasons for going into engineering.\n\nShe was a professor of sociology at Oregon State University (OSU) from 1977 until 1988.

In 2011, during the band's hiatus, Varkatzas also started a hardcore project with Bleeding Through vocalist Brandan Schieppati named I Am War.\n\nAt 14, Varkatzas, along with guitarist Dan Jacobs and drummer Brandon Saller, formed a punk band called Retribution. By 1998, when Varkatzas was 16, Retribution developed a heavier style and changed names to Atreyu, as seen on their 1998 independent release, \"Visions\". After their 2001 EP, \"Fractures in the Facade of Your Porcelain Beauty\", fell into the hands of Victory Records, the band signed to Victory and released their debut album, \"Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses\" in 2002. Since then, the band has released four other albums before embarking on hiatus,: \"The Curse\" in 2004, \"A Death-Grip on Yesterday\" in 2006, \"Lead Sails Paper Anchor\" in 2007, and \"Congregation of the Damned\" in 2009. After ten years of worldwide success, the band went on hiatus.\n\nOn July 1, 2014, the band officially announced their return from hiatus by playing several festivals including Aftershock and Slipknot's Knotfest. A new single was released on their official YouTube channel titled \"So Others May Live\" and plans for a new album titled \"Long Live\". Long Live was released on September 18, 2015. Furthermore, a second album called \"In Our Wake\" was released on October 12, 2018. 3 singles have been released so far including a music Video for the song In our wake. Another single, “Super Hero” was written by the band, along with Aaron Gillespie of Underoath and M.

The band released an album entitled \"Outlive You All\" in 2012.\n\nDuring the early days of Atreyu's tour cycles, Varkatzas struggled with alcoholism which greatly affected his vocals during live performances. Since \"The Curse\", he has edged away from alcohol and drugs and has since found fitness and training to be a more suitable way to relieve anxiety and stress. Varkatzas ran Hellenic Crossfit and Muay Thai in Orange County, California until November 1, 2015, and practices Muay Thai, Boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He wrote about a lot of his drinking problems on \"A Death-Grip On Yesterday\", which were the lyrical inspiration behind songs such as \"Ex's and Oh's (Atreyu song)\" and \"The Theft\".\n"}

It is located between Lochs Ore and Gelly to the north-west and south-east respectively. It is separated from Cowdenbeath by the village of Lumphinnans. According to the 2007 population estimate, the town has a population of 6,834.\n\nFrom the 1830s until the 1960s Lochgelly was a mining town. With the industry now dead the town has slipped into economic and social deprivation as with other former mining towns. Lochgelly is now classed as a town in need of both social and economical regeneration and has the cheapest average home price in Britain.\n\nLochgelly, as part of the old parliamentary constituency of West Fife, was known as \"Little Moscow\" up to the 1950s owing to its Communist political leanings.\n\nAn area of Lochgelly was known as the Happy Lands (or Happy Valley) and is referenced in the Scottish folk song 'The Kelty Clippie'.\n\nThe town is served by Lochgelly railway station on the line between Edinburgh and Markinch.\n\nIn the 1970s new investment was brought in the form of a factory and development office built by the Andrew Corporation. This created microwave antennae under the banner of Andrew Antennas, symbolised by a red lightning flash on the dishes they made. These dishes were primarily for commercial and military usage. The firm located at the end of \"The Avenue\" on the south-east side of the village. Adjoining fields were used for testing new equipment.\n\nLochgelly is also the home of the most reputed firm that produced tawses, John Dick (Saddlers), and was hence a synonym for that typically Scottish device for corporal punishment.\n\nThe town derives its name from the nearby body of water, Loch Gelly. The name comes from the Gaelic Loch Gheallaidh which, loosely translated, means ‘Shining Waters’ or ‘Loch of Brightness’. Land around the loch is owned by Wemyss 1952 Trustees.\n\nThe loch was once a very popular spot for the local community and was used on a regular basis for water skiing up until the early 90s. Since then the loch has not been used for water sports.\n\nLochgelly used to be served in the entertainment sector by the Lochgelly Centre, which had a 424-seat theatre that was ideal for community theatre groups, dance groups and music events. The Lochgelly Centre closed in 2010 for remodelling/refurbishment work, leaving Lochgelly without any access to children's facilities, elderly facilities, community access to various events and classes. The centre re-opened in 2012 and now boasts a range of refurbished and new facilities including the New Jennie-Lee library. The centre runs many classes and boasts an impressive theatre for a small town, on which a variety of artists, groups, plays, musical, poets and drama productions regularly appear.\n\nThe town is also entertained by Lochgelly Town Hall, which is now establishing itself as a venue for live music. Rubber Stamp Promotions hold regular events at the venue, with bands such as The Vivians and Sergeant playing there in 2009.\n\nLochgelly is home to the junior football club Lochgelly Albert. Former clubs include Lochgelly United who played in the senior leagues between 1890 and 1928 and Lochgelly Violet.\n\nThere is quarter mile oval racing track just outside the town known as Thunder Valley Raceway. The circuit hosted the 2013 Superstox World Championship.\n\nTo tackle issues of multiple deprivation in the town various organisations such as the Coalfields Regeneration Trust have been given funding monies to distribute locally via community-based groups such as social enterprises, charities and voluntary groups.\n\nThe Lochgelly Community Council holds meetings, on the 2nd Wednesday of each month, to discuss issues affecting Lochgelly, from planning issues to general issues representative of the local community. All meetings are open to the public. The Community Council is made up of local members of the Lochgelly Community and also include local politicians in attendance from the SNP (Ian Chisolm) and Labour (Mark Hood). Monthly minutes from the meetings are available in the Lochgelly Library.\n\nThe Lochgelly Community Development Forum (LCDF), until early 2011 known as the Lochgelly Community Regeneration Forum, is a voluntary group representing the interests of the local community and providing a forum for raising local issues with Fife Council. The LCDF publish a 2 sided glossy newsletter, \"The Voice\", which is delivered to every home in Lochgelly. This replaced a full magazine, designed for free by a locally based not-for-profit Social Enterprise (Subliminal Directions), now closed.\n\nMooth O the Yooth, is a local non-profit group, managed by and for local youths, with support from Fife Council workers, community wardens and community police officers. The 'Moothies' aim to provide and set up activities for other youths in the area. Activities and successes include arranging the 'Bairns Ball' (a youth disco), which is held on a monthly basis in Lochgelly. The Moothies obtained a Youth Shelter (an open steel construction, similar to a bus shelter, with a seating area and roof to provide some shelter), located at the bottom of Lochgelly Public Park. The shelter has since been vandalised.\n\nIn January 2010 'Loch of Shining Waters', an online not-for-profit community platform, was launched. It allows members of the local community to publish articles about Lochgelly, raise issues of concern and find out more about local issues. The aim is to release all material under a Creative Commons Licence, provide information about Lochgelly and the issues affecting the town and provide tutorials covering a wide range of technologies, such as using open source scripts for gaining a web presence, as well as articles on computer and online safety.\n\nThe Royal Oak Community Club provides affordable venue hire for many smaller groups in the local community, such as the Lochgelly Community Council, dance groups and meals for the elderly but the work they do is currently in a limited capacity due to the restrictions of their facilities. Having recently achieved charitable status and social enterprise status they plan to redevelop their building with a complete upgrade of facilities. During the refurbishment works they will be seeking temporary premises for the Lochgelly community to use.\n\nApproximately 4 km from Lochgelly is the Fife Ethylene Plant, known locally as Mossmorran and run by ExxonMobil. This is one of Europe's largest ethylene plants and is bordered by the communities of Lochgelly, Lumphinnans, Cowdenbeath and Auchtertool.\n\nThere is local concern over the impacts Mossmorran has on the local communities regarding flaring events, noise pollution, light pollution, vibrations, safety, health and environmental impacts. There are also supporters of the development.\n\nExxonMobil invest in the local area through community schemes, such as the Links programme, which provides additional funding to the majority of schools in the local communities surrounding the complex.\n\nInstallation of the first wind turbine of nine at the Little Raith wind farm, south of Lochgelly, was completed in September 2012. The farm is 1.6 km south of the nearest houses in Lochgelly and 1.3 km from Cowdenbeath. It is Fife's first commercial wind farm and is immediately to the north of the Fife Ethylene Plant.\n\nThe wind farm is owned by Kennedy Renewables who purchased the site from West Coast Energy.\n\nIn 2010 Lochgelly participated in the Lochgelly Charrette, led by designer Andrés Duany. The Lochgelly Charrette was the only charrette in Scotland to be led by the local authority.\n\nThe Charrette process has identified areas in need of regeneration within the town centre and aims to improve the central area of Lochgelly by regenerating existing walkways and buildings. It included a review of all design-based policies, simplifying the mechanisms to achieve good design for planning zones, cross departmental working with the transportation services so proposals can work towards the Scottish Government policy statement 'Designing for Streets'.\n\nThere has been much local criticism of the Lochgelly Charrette. It received criticisms from the Community Council and the Lochgelly Development Forum for ignoring them on specific issues. There were objections to the halting of plans for a supermarket with petrol station in favour of plans for a smaller store objected. There was also criticism of the removal of Lochgelly Golf Course and other green areas for housing developments.\n\nFurther plans include completely redeveloping the town centre to improve access and better integrate walkways. The plan will take until 2066 to be fully realised.\n\n"}

By the 10th century, chancellors had no power to speak of unless they were simultaneously regent, or otherwise supported by the Fujiwara. Although the position continued in name until 1885, by the beginning of the 12th century, the office was essentially powerless, and was often vacant for lengthy periods. Substantial administrative power over the government was in other hands.\n\nThis prominent office was briefly resurrected under the Meiji Constitution with the appointment of Sanjō Sanetomi in 1871, before being abolished completely in 1885 in favor of the newly created office of Prime Minister.\n\nThe Chancellor presided over the Great Council of State, and controlled the officers of the state, in particular the \"Sadaijin\" and \"Udaijin\", as well as four great councillors and three minor councillors. The ministers in turn controlled other elements of the government.\n\n\n"}

Since 2010, he also pursues a successful solo career in country music with his debut EP \"Town Line\", which was released on March 1, 2011 on Stroudavarious Records. Lewis' first full-length solo release, \"The Road\", was released by Blaster Records on November 13, 2012. Lewis released his second studio album \"Sinner\" on September 16, 2016. His third studio album \"State I'm In\" was released on April 12, 2019, a day before celebrating his 47th birthday.\n\nIn 2006, Lewis was ranked at number 49 in the \"Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists\" by \"Hit Parader\".\n\nLewis was born in Vermont to hippie parents living in a log cabin. When his parents split up, he moved with his father to Springfield, Massachusetts, where he attended high school.\n\nIn July 2010, Lewis finished recording a country music EP entitled \"Town Line\" that was released March 1, 2011 on Stroudavarious Records. It features seven tracks including three versions of the first single \"Country Boy\" featuring George Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Chris Young, as well as the songs \"Massachusetts\", \"Vicious Circles\", \"The Story Never Ends\", and a re-recording of \"Tangled Up in You\" originally from \"The Illusion of Progress\". Lewis said in a July 2011 interview that he was introduced to country music as a child by his grandfather, but his interest was recently rekindled when he toured with fellow rock turned occasional country singer Kid Rock. \n\nLewis released his first full solo album, \"The Road\", in November 2012. Its debut single, \"Endless Summer\", has also made the country charts. Lewis wrote every song on the 10 track collection, except for \"Granddaddy's Gun\" which was penned by Dallas Davidson, Rhett Akins and Bobby Pinson, marking the first time Lewis has recorded outside material for an album. In an interview with Broadway's Electric Barnyard, Lewis said he recorded \"Granddaddy's Gun\" as both a compliment to a friend, and because he was pressed for time.\n\nLewis wrote songs for his second solo album whilst touring in support of \"The Road\", often performing with Katz Von Brunenburg in his live sets. The album, dubbed \"Sinner\", was mostly recorded in a single 18 hour session, with many tracks done in one take. Aaron's daughter Zoe also provides guest vocals on one song.\n\nOn April 12, 2019, Lewis released his third solo album, \"State I'm In\".\n\nLewis was featured on the song \"No Sex\" by Limp Bizkit on their album \"Significant Other\". He was also featured on a remix of the song \"Crawling\" on Linkin Park's first remix album \"Reanimation\" (titled as \"Krwlng\" on the remix album). He contributed vocals to the song \"Follow\" by Sevendust from \"Animosity\", and to the songs \"Bleed\" and \"Send in the Clowns\" by the band Cold from \"13 Ways to Bleed on Stage\". He's also featured on Jimmie's Chicken Shack's song \"Falling Out\", the only single off their 2004 album \"re.present\". In December 2010 while promoting his \"Town Line\" album Lewis collaborated with Corey Taylor for a one-night-only acoustic duet show covering songs such as Pearl Jam's \"Black\", Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb\", and Alice in Chains' \"Down in a Hole\". Lewis told Broadway's Electric Barnyard that he's open to collaborating with anyone. When asked specifically about Jason Aldean, whom he shouts out in \"Endless Summer\", Lewis said, \"Yeah.\"\n\nAt the 2014 Kansas City Rockfest, during the performance of the song \"Something to Remind You\" from Staind's eponymous 2011 album, Aaron Lewis scolded some men for groping a teenage female fan while she was crowd surfing. His rant was met with applause from the audience.\n\nAt the 2014 World Series Game 5, Aaron Lewis flubbed the United States' national anthem. Instead of singing \"at the twilight's last gleaming,\" Lewis sang, \"were so gallantly streaming,\" words that come later on. Lewis released a statement of apology, stating, \"All I can say is I'm sorry and ask for the Nation's forgiveness. My nerves got the best of me and I am completely torn up about what happened. America is the greatest country in the world. The Star-Spangled Banner means so much to so many, including myself. I hope everyone can understand the intensity of the situation and my true intent of this performance. I hope that the Nation, Major League Baseball and the many fans of our national pastime can forgive me.\" The incident was particularly embarrassing for Lewis, as three years earlier he publicly criticized singer Christina Aguilera for doing the same thing.\n\nAaron Lewis was due to take part in a solo performance in Oklahoma City when he took to the stage and was three minutes from finishing his performance before shouting at the unruly audience and storming off stage.\n\nMembers of the audience can be heard shouting at the singer, causing him to stop playing and shout “Shut the fuck up” before more audience members hurled abuse at the singer.\n\nOne audience member can be heard screaming, “Fuck you”. Obviously not happy with having insults hurled at him, the singer stopped playing and waited for the audience to be civilized. Another audience member can be heard shouting at the crowd, “Shut the fuck up and go home”.\n\nAaron responds to the audience saying “Listen, I'm fucking good. I don't have to do this... Listen, if you don't shut the fuck up, you can't even hear the guitar. So shut up. I've got 3 more fucking minutes... Can you please, for once-- Through the whole fucking evening, you guys have talked all fucking night. Shut the fuck up or I'm done! It's so fucking ironic that this song is a thank you and I can't get you to shut the fuck up to hear it.”\n\nHe tries to begin his song but, after the crowd refuses to be quiet, he drops his guitar on the ground and tosses a red drink cup into the audience before walking off stage.\"\n\nLewis is married to Vanessa Lewis and has three daughters, Zoe Jane, Nyla Rae and Indie Shay. Lewis also has two sisters, Evyette and Rachel, as well as a brother, Jesse. Regarding the commercial success of Staind's albums in the early 2000s, Lewis reflected \"A lot of other people made a shit load of money but we're the same as any of you. I have to work to pay my bills.\"\n\nLewis is a registered Republican. He is a \"constitutional conservative\"; he opposes high taxes and supports marijuana legalization. His views were expressed in the song \"Country Boy\". Lewis supported Donald Trump before the United States presidential election of 2016, even though he said he was disappointed with his \"bickering and name-calling\" that was not exhibiting presidential behavior.\n\nIn a five-minute interview with \"Outdoor Life\" magazine Lewis said that he has been hunting whitetail deer since he was old enough to keep up in the \"good old woods,\" since probably around age 4 or 5. His preferred method of hunting deer is with a compound or recurve bow, and he occasionally utilizes a muzzleloader.\n\nOn November 4, 2006, Lewis performed at his old high school in Longmeadow, Massachusetts and gave all the proceeds to the music department to fund the department's expenses to buy new equipment and supplies. Lewis' main focus, however, is the non-profit organization It Takes a Community, where he and his wife have started to reopen their daughters' elementary school in Worthington, Massachusetts.\n\n"}

Incorporated into the Roman Empire from 15 BC, a Roman road ran along the Krimmler Ache stream up to the Alpine crest. After the Empire's decline in the 5th century, the area became largely Germanised by Bavarian settlers.\n\nInitially part of the medieval Duchy of Bavaria, the \"Chrvmbel\" manor was first mentioned in a 1228 deed, when the upper \"Pinzgau\" region was purchased by the Salzburg archbishops. A parish church was mentioned in 1244. At the time, Krimml was strategically important as a stop on the route connecting Salzburg with the Ahrntal and the County of Tyrol.\n\nAs in many Salzburg lands where the Protestant Reformation had spread, the peasants in the Krimml area were subject to Counter-Reformation measures enacted by the prince-archbishops and several Protestant families were expelled. After the Archbishopric was secularised, the former ecclesiastical estates finally passed to the Austrian Empire in 1815. From the late 19th century onwards, Alpine tourism gradually became an important economic factor.\n\nKrimml station is the western terminus of the Pinzgauer Lokalbahn narrow-gauge railway line to Zell am See.\n\nSeats in the municipal assembly (\"Gemeinderat\"):\n"}

Jack McGeorge was one of its founders.\n\nBlack Rose was one of the founding coalition partners of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, which was founded in 1997.\n\nFrom 1997 through 2012, the organization held hotel-based conventions that included educational sessions, vendor rooms and play parties. For much of that time, the events were annual and by 2000 had grown to be among the largest such events held on the East Coast. Annual events continued through 2009. The group's last large event was held in 2012 to celebrate its 25th anniversary.\n\nOver Thanksgiving weekend, in 2002, an article in the \"Washington Post\" publicly highlighted Black Rose cofounder Jack McGeorge’s leadership in the Washington, DC BDSM and leather community. McGeorge had made no attempt to conceal his involvement in the BDSM and leather lifestyles; his full name appeared prominently on websites, and he said as much to the Post and other media. He did, however, offer his resignation to Hans Blix, hoping to preserve the credibility of his organization (the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, called UNMOVIC) before the weapons inspections in Iraq. Blix refused to accept McGeorge's resignation. Later, Hua Jiang, spokeswoman for U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, said that being into BDSM was no more likely to be a cross-cultural problem in the Middle East than any number of other issues.\n\nThe increased prominence of the internet, and especially the founding of the social networking site Fetlife in 2008, allowed alternative sexuality groups to multiply and flourish. This diminished Black Rose's central position in the Washington BDSM community, although it remains a significant presence. It is an especially important resource for newcomers to BDSM, for whom its educational emphasis is both practical and less intimidating than other points of entry.\n\nBlack Rose hosts regular educational classes addressing BDSM activities, issues, and safety, currently at The Crucible, Washington's longstanding BDSM club, in Washington, DC. For most of its history, the group has also hosted monthly socials whose emphasis have varied over time from hands-on educational workshops to social play parties. \n\nBlack Rose is governed by a board of directors elected by its membership.\n\nBlack Rose includes several special interest groups (SIGs):\n\nAmong its other activities, Black Rose annually grants awards:\n\n\n"}

Kohler was acting Head from May 2008 - July 2009) and Jim Owen from 2009 to 2012.\n\nMrs Tammy Day (Current Deputy Head /Senior Mistress) was appointed as Acting Head for a term until Mr Paul Woods assumed office in January 2013. During this time Mrs Sandra Melhuish (Assistant Head) was appointed as Acting Senior Mistress/Deputy Head and Mr Russell Dean (Assistant Head) was appointed Senior Master/Deputy Head and they both have the right to sign the School Roll again.\n\nMr Paul Woods assumed office as Head Master in January 2013 and resigned in 2015 leaving Ms T. Day as acting Head.\n\nMrs Tammy Day was appointed permanent Head in February 2017.\n\nEach pupil and member of staff belongs to one of six Houses:\n\n\"The Four Foundation Houses:\n\n\"The Two Newer Houses\"\n\nEach house has its own colour:\n\nIn September 2006 the new intake, year 7, had colours added to their ties. A coloured diagonal stripe denotes their year group. Below this is a stripe in the House colours (for King Alfred's a shade of gold). Ensuing years have a year colour, with their House colour below it. The new tie also features the Bishop's Crozier symbol of the school. In September 2007 the new intake, year 7, had a blue stripe added to their ties. From September 2013 the new intake, year 7, have a grey/silver stripe on their ties.\n\nThe Choir Form was founded in 1973 and takes boys and girls from all six Houses from year 7 to the sixth form. (Year 7 pupils may volunteer for the Junior Choir.) While remaining members of their Houses, pupils in the Choir Form attend registration together, and sing in assembly, hymn practice, choir practice and compline together. They attend a residential singing week every year, which has been at Bradwell on Sea, Seasalter, Walsingham, and Winchester. In 2004-5 the Choir Form was renamed the Music Form to incorporate a wider range of musical abilities and the modernisation of school worship.\n\nVarious parts of the school include:\n\n\nBishop Stopford's School has had three chaplains since 1967: Rev. James Lowry B.D., Rev. Stephen Taylor BSc., and Rev. Antony Homer. All have chosen to take the title \"father\".\n\nAs well as taking a major part in school religious occasions, the chaplain is much involved with the pastoral side of the school, having regular contact with the Senior Six, Heads of Houses and the Senior Leadership Team of the School.\n\nFr. Antony Homer left in February 2011 to join the Ordinariate of the Roman Catholic Church. A lay chaplain, Jonathan Seabrook, was then appointed, who is an assistant head teacher with responsibility for religion and worship. He is also head of divinity.\n\nAll pupils must attend one assembly a week, normally with their Houses. The Sixth Form has its own assembly on Fridays.\n\nThe assembly at Bishop Stopford's School begins with organ music. A House prefect from one of the Houses whose assembly is being held then leads in the procession of all the prefects from the two Houses. Following the prefects are the senior staff, normally the Deputy Head Master and the Deputy Head Mistress. Behind the Deputy Heads comes the Chaplain. who is then followed by the Head's prefects, who are followed by the Head. Gowns are still worn but assemblies are now less formal and less religious than previously.\n\nThe school chapel was formerly a small room on the first floor of the West Wing of the school, but is now in the vestibule accessed from the corridor between the East and West Wings, by the great hall. The Eucharist is said in the chapel every morning as is the \"Prayer For All Stopfordians\". This is a special prayer for all those who have a connection with the school, living or dead.\n\nThe stage contains the great altar, said to be the largest mobile altar in the Diocese of London, which was borrowed by the Oxford Movement for use in the Royal Albert Hall in its 150th anniversary celebrations. The Altar is covered by one of four different Altar cloths of appropriate colours for the Church year, made by various teachers and pupils of the school.\n\nThe school's pipe organ was made from the remains of a church organ salvaged from Sandylands Methodist Church in Morecambe, Lancashire. Bought for £400, the organ is now insured for several hundreds of thousands of pounds. A new console was added during its installation, and additional pipes were bought. The case was rebuilt and new wiring and electric bellows installed. The motor for the blower was purchased from the Trinity College of Music. As with many cathedral organs, the dummy pipes at the front of the organ are purely decorative.\n\nSeveral notable organists have given recitals on this instrument, including Carlo Curley, Peter Hurford, Stephen Darlington, Thomas Trotter, and John Scott.\n\nThe school is noted for its traditions, many of which date from the time of the first Head Master.\n\nEvery year pupils from Years 7 to 10 undertake an eleven-mile (seventeen kilometre) sponsored walk known as the \"School Pilgrimage\" along the canal tow-path of the River Lea Navigation from Ware to Enfield Lock. Sums raised have contributed substantially to the school foundation fund. In 2009 the route was blocked and the Pilgrimage was completed by proxy (as has always been stated on the sponsor forms) a fortnight later.\n\nEvery year, on Ascension Day, a group of pupils used to go round the boundaries of the school striking selected areas with special whips. This was based on the Anglo-Saxon practice of beating the bounds. This has since been modernised, but a special Ascension Day assembly is still held, remembering the practice.\n\nAt the top of every piece of work, pupils used to be asked to write the words 'With My Duty', or in German lessons \"Meine beste arbeit\" and French lessons \"C'est mon devoir\" to show their acknowledgment of their duty to themselves, their parents, the school, and to God.\nThis Is rarely done now.\n\nThe school is notable as one of few in Britain still to require its prefects to wear gowns. In 2003, however, the new Head instituted blazers, with gowns now reserved for special occasions. The gowns vary in colour but all take the form of a sleeveless robe. House Prefects wear grey gowns, School Prefects wear royal blue and Senior Prefects navy blue. House Captains also wear navy blue. The most senior rank of prefects, the Senior VI, wear navy blue Senior Prefect gowns with a coloured stripe to signify their rank. The Deputy Head Boy and Girl have a thin purple stripe and the Head Boy and Girl have a thick purple stripe. The most senior and oldest rank of prefect, the Head Master's Prefects, have a thick red stripe on their gown.\n\n\"Forgiveness\" was an alternative to corporal punishment. An offending pupil was offered a choice between receiving a caning and performing \"forgiveness\". A pupil who chose forgiveness was made to carry out arduous tasks or physical exercise for approximately one hour, after which he was said to be 'forgiven'. To make the choice, the miscreant was presented with a pair of blue and a pair of black shorts. If he opted to be caned, he would select the blue shorts. If he chose the black shorts he would receive forgiveness. .\n\nWith the outlawing of corporal punishment in state schools in England in 1987, the \"trial by shorts\" procedure became defunct. In recent years Forgiveness has become less and less common.\n\nAlthough corporal punishment is no longer practised, for a while the school displayed the old canes in the Great Hall and the Head Master's study. These canes, along with special whips, were used in the beating of the bounds celebration.\n\nSince the school was founded, every new pupil and teacher at the school has signed his or her name on the School Roll. Originally a single roll of paper, kept in a leather cylinder, it has now had to have additional paper added to the first roll and two new separate rolls (and cylinders) made to accommodate new names. The roll used to be carried in the procession every morning in Assembly, but since there are now three cylinders. On special occasions one of the three cylinders is carried to signify the roll's importance in the life of the school.\n\nEddie Baily taught PE at the school.\n\n\n"}

This light-hearted volume argues in a humorously dictatorial tone that \"The jolliest indoor games for boys and girls demand a floor.\" Illustrated with photographs and drawings, it briefly describes a number of games that can be played on \"well lit and airy\" floors with \"four main groups\" of toys: soldiers about two inches high (Wells regrets the \"curse of militarism\" that makes civilians hard to find), largish wooden bricks, boards and planks, and electric railway rolling stock and rails. Various remarks show that the book is based on Wells's experience of playing such games with his two sons, George Philip \"Gip\" Wells (1901-1985) and Frank Richard Wells (1903-1982), identified here only by their initials.\n\nAlthough \"Floor Games\" is often characterized as a \"companion book\" to Wells's \"Little Wars\" (1913), the earlier book was conceived of as a self-standing volume so that the author might later write a book devoted purely to war games. \"Floor Games\" describes mostly specific games for young children, whereas \"Little Wars\" describes war games for older children and adults.\n\nWells describes how the boards and planks can be used to set up various imaginative geographies to play the \"game of wonderful islands\" in which the floor is the sea, create the setting for \"twin cities\" (to allow his two sons a measure of independence in their creations), or undertake engineering projects (he describes the building of funiculars in some detail).\n\nDuring World War II, the toy soldiers that inspired \"Floor Games\" and \"Little Wars\" were confiscated by the police from Wells's son (by Rebecca West) Anthony West, on account of his pacifism.\n\n\"Floor Games\" has been regarded as a precursor not only of learning through play but also of nonverbal child psychotherapy. Along with \"Little Wars,\" the book has often been reprinted. A recent edition of the book was published by Skirmisher Publishing LLC in 2006 and includes a foreword by game design giant James F.

Having shown his portfolio to artist Bryan Talbot, he quickly found himself given work by Swiftsure (on the \"Lieutenant Fl'ff\" strip). After this, he worked on a \"dummy comic\" David Lloyd was creating for Fleetway called \"Fantastic Adventure\". This was his first meeting with writer Grant Morrison, who was writing the \"California Crew\" strip (\"loosely based on the A-Team\") Yeowell was drawing. While \"Fantastic Adventure\" wasn't picked up, John Higgins asked Yeowell to help him with a music magazine's comic strip off the back of it and, afterwards, helped him get work at Marvel UK. He started on \"Spider-Man and Zoids\" before doing \"Action Force\" and later \"ThunderCats\".\n\nOn \"Zoids\", he worked with Morrison again and as a result, Morrison picked Yeowell to be the main artist on new superhero strip \"Zenith\", to run in \"2000 AD\" beginning in 1987.\n\n\"Zenith\" was a success, running to four full-length series plus several one-offs. Yeowell was headhunted by American comics companies and has worked on \"Batman\", \"The Fantastic Four\", \"The Invisibles\", \"JSA\" and \"Starman\". He continued his association with Morrison, collaborating on \"Sebastian O\" and \"The New Adventures of Hitler\".\n\nYeowell's work is noted for delicate penmanship and lifelike facial expressions, with a notable economy of style that means that his work suits both colour and monochrome treatment.

Items such as bone that are in the soil will absorb fluoride from the groundwater over time. From the amount of absorbed fluoride in the item, the time that the item has been in the soil can be estimated.\n\nMany instances of this dating method compare the amount of fluorine and uranium in the bones to nitrogen dating to create more accurate estimation of date. Older bones have more fluorine and uranium and less nitrogen. But because decomposition happens at different speeds in different places, it's not possible to compare bones from different sites.\n\nAs not all objects absorb fluorine at the same rate, this also undermines the accuracy of such a dating technique. Although this can be compensated for by accommodating for the rate of absorption in calculations, such an accommodation tends to have a rather large margin of error.\n\nIn 1953 this test was used to easily identify that the 'Piltdown Man' was forged, almost 50 years after it was originally 'unearthed'.\n\n"}

{"id": "2218628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218628", "title": "Dubh Artach", "text": "Dubh Artach\n\nDubh Artach (; ) is a remote skerry of basalt rock off the west coast of Scotland lying west of Colonsay and south-west of the Ross of Mull.\n\nA lighthouse designed by Thomas Stevenson with a tower height of was erected between 1867 and 1872 with a shore station constructed on the isle of Erraid. The rock is subject to extraordinary sea conditions with waves of or more being encountered by the keepers. Despite these adverse conditions several men served the light for lengthy periods until it was automated in 1971. \"Dubh Artach\" is the official name of the lighthouse, although the skerry itself is also known as Dhu Heartach. Various interpretations have been provided for the original meaning of the Gaelic name, of which \"The Black Rock\" is the most likely.\n\nIn pre-historic times Dhu Heartach was covered by the ice sheets that spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides. After the last retreat of the ice around 20,000 years ago, sea levels were up to lower than at present. Although the isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task, circa 14,000 BP it is likely that Dubh Heartach was at the western edge of a large land bridge linking what is now the island of Ireland to Scotland. This land mass included the islands of Jura and Islay and was probably connected to the mainland of Scotland by an isthmus near Loch Craignish, south of Oban.\n\nSteadily rising sea levels would then have slowly isolated and finally all but submerged Dhu Heartach, which today is a rounded, dark green mass of basaltic rock called augite, which is long and wide, and which rises to above sea level. Submarine surveys indicate that the rock is at the eastern end of a valley stretching into the Atlantic, which may \"account for the seemingly abnormal seas to which the tower is subjected\". It is an isolated outpost of the Inner Hebrides archipelago. The author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote:\nAn ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no pleasant assemblage of shelves, and pools, and creeks, about which a child might play for a whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No other life was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself.\nThe translation of \"Dubh Artach\" is \"The Black Rock\", \"artach\" being a now obsolete Gaelic word for a rock or rocky ground both in Scottish Gaelic and in Irish. The variation between the anglicised forms \"Dubh Artach\" and \"Dhu Heartach\" is a simple case of false splitting where the final [h] of [t̪uh arˠʃt̪əx] in pronunciation seemingly is part of the following word, suggesting \"*hartach\" or \"heartach\" to the untrained ear.\n\nStevenson believed that 'black and dismal' was a translation of the name, noting that \"as usual, in Gaelic, it is not the only one.\" Adamnan in his 7th-century \"Life of St Columba\" poetically calls the rock \"An Dubh Iar-stac\", \"The Black Stack of the West\". Watson (1926) suggests the root is Old Irish \"hirt\" meaning \"death\", (which he also believes occurs in Hirta, the main island of the St Kilda archipelago), and offers \"am Duibh-hirteach\", meaning \"the black deadly one\". The skerry was also known as \"St. John's Rock\" prior to the construction of the lighthouse.\n\nBetween 1800 and 1854 thirty ships were wrecked on the reef; however, the requirement for a lighthouse was not only to warn seafarers away from Dhu Heartach itself, but also to guide them past the fearsome Torran Rocks, which lie between the Ross of Mull and Colonsay. Originally it was considered to be an impossible site for a light, but the loss of the steamer \"Bussorah\" with all thirty-three hands on her maiden voyage in 1863 and of an astonishing 24 vessels in the area in a storm on 30–31 December 1865 encouraged positive action under pressure from insurers Lloyd's of London and a Captain Bedford of the Admiralty. The engineering work was supervised by the famous Stevenson family of engineers, the brothers Thomas (father of Robert Louis) and David commencing work in 1866. Thomas noted that \"it would be a work of no ordinary magnitude\".\n\nThe land base for the construction of the light was Erraid near Iona. Fourteen miles distant from Dhu Heartach across open sea, the little island provided a granite quarry and a shore station once the work on the lighthouse was completed. Initial construction on the rock, which began on 25 June 1867 under the supervision of Alan Brebner, required a barrack for the workmen made of iron. Summer gales brought high seas, which resulted in breaking water falling on the roof above sea level. It held firm, although fourteen men including Brebner were trapped there for five days, and at one point seawater poured in through the trapdoor, swirled around them and exited with their remaining food supplies. Describing a similar occasion, R. L. Stevenson wrote:\nDespite these hardships a diameter foundation pit was excavated and by 1869 a solid portion of tower rising above foundation level had been completed. This was no mean feat. On one occasion eleven two-ton stones were dislodged from the third course of stonework and carried off the rock, never to be seen again. Robert Stevenson noted that this destruction occurred at the same height \"above the sea \"as the glass panes in the lantern of Smeaton's lighthouse\"\" at Eddystone.\n\nThe solid base weighing 1,840 tons rises more than above the pounding seas, more than twice as high as its nearest British rival of Skerryvore. The blocks, having been shaped and fitted on Erraid, were towed out to the rock in barges by the steamer ‘Dhuheartach’ each barge carrying 16 tons. Masonry work was completed in 1871 and the lantern, optical apparatus and fog bell installed the following year, Dubh Artach becoming the first isolated rock light in Britain to use paraffin. The finished tower rises above the foundation in seventy-seven courses of stonework all told.\n\nThe total cost of the works undertaken by the Northern Lighthouse Board was £65,784, excluding the £10,300 cost of establishing the shore station on Erraid. However, the extraordinary nature of the work should not be reduced to mere numbers. Stevenson was moved to note that:\n\nCompletion of the construction work did not result in an end to the hazards. At low tide the landing stage is forty feet above a boat, yet not completely out of the reach of the swell. Landings other than via the precarious use of dangling ropes from a derrick were most unusual even on calm days. The storm seas could rise to extraordinary heights. In the first year of operation, the copper lightning conductor was wrenched out of its sockets by a storm at a height of above high water.\n\nThe first principal keeper was James Ewing who looked after the light for the next eleven years. Despite the exceptionally adverse conditions faced by the keepers, which resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, Ewing was not the only one who served the light for a decade or more. However, some found the lonely rock and its cramped quarters less to their taste. One had to be prevented from diving into the sea and attempting to swim ashore.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The late twentieth century saw an expansion of its range in the UK.\n\nIt is found in forest clearings and edges, meadows and steppe where it occurs up to 1,500-1,700 m above sea level. They are a common sight in unimproved grasslands across southern Britain, particularly on the South Downs, but also extending slightly further north to places such as the Dunstable Downs.\n\n\"Melanargia galathea\" has a wingspan of . \nIn these medium-sized butterflies the upper side of the wings is decorated with white and gray-black or dark brown markings, but it is always gray-black or dark brown checkered in the basal and distal areas. The underside is similar to the upper side but the drawings is light gray or light brown. On the underside of the hindwings is present a row of gray eye spots. The males and the females are quite similar, except that some females may have a yellowish nuance on the underside of the wings. Seitz - \"M. galathea\". In the otherwise black cell of both wing an oval white spot which is not divided bya transverse bar. On the hindwing above the ocelli are quite invisible or shine through very faintly from the underside.\n\nThis species is rather similar to the Iberian marbled white (\"Melanargia lachesis\") that replaces \"M. galathea\" in Spain and southern France.\n\nThe caterpillars are about 28 millimeters long. They are green or yellow with some lighter and darker narrow longitudinal lines. The head is always light brown.\n\nLike other members of its subfamily, the larvae feed on various grasses. These include \"Phleum\" (\"P. pratense\"), \"Poa\" (\"P. annua\", \"P. trivalis\"), \"Festuca rubra\", \"Bromus erectus\", \"Dactylis\", \"Brachypodium pinnatum\", \"Agrostis capillaris\", \"Elytrigia\", \"Holcus\", \"Dactylis\", \"Triticum\" and \"Agropyron\" species .\n\nEggs are laid on the wing, or from brief perches on grass stems, and are just sprinkled among the grass stems. Upon hatching, the larvae immediately enter hibernation and only feed the following spring when the fresh growth occurs. They are a lime-green colour, with a dark green line running down the middle of their back. Pupation takes place at ground level in a loose cocoon. Adults can be found from early June to early September. On a good site, in warm, sunny weather, thousands can be seen gently fluttering amongst the grass heads.\n\n"}
{"id": "2218642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218642", "title": "Small pearl-bordered fritillary", "text": "Small pearl-bordered fritillary\n\nBoloria selene, known in Europe as the small pearl-bordered fritillary and in North America as the silver-bordered fritillary, is a species of butterfly of the family Nymphalidae. It is found across Europe and North America, and feeds exclusively on violets in its larval stages. This species prefers wet grassland habitats, where its larval food source, violets, are found. It overwinters in its larval stage, and eggs hatch in the late summer to early autumn. Members of this species are prey for multiple types of birds and other insects.\n\nDue to modern agriculture, most of the grassland habitats that sustain \"Boloria selene\" are fragmented or lost all together in favor of farmland. Because of this, the small pearl-bordered fritillary has seen a serious drop in population across Europe, in some places as much as 80%. Factors including limited habitat range, low dispersal rate, and strong food specialization also contribute to population loss. Despite modern conservation efforts, the number of small pearl-bordered fritillaries is still declining. The North American populations appear to be affected in the same way, at least in the continental United States.\n\nThe small pearl-bordered fritillary is similar to the pearl-bordered fritillary but has black chevrons on the edge of its wings, a large central black dot on each wing, and white pearls on the underside. Males tend to be smaller than females, with a wingspan of 35 to 41 mm. Females are 38 to 44 mm in length. Though the small pearl-bordered fritillary is similar to the pearl-bordered fritillary it is much brighter in color because the pearl-bordered fritillary emerges from its pupa earlier. Seitz - A. \"selene\" Schiff. (= \"euphrosyne\" Bgstr., \"euphrasia\" Lew., \"silene\" Haw.) (67g). Forewing above and beneath very similar to tliat of the preceding [\"selenis\"]. Hindwing beneath with the median band distinct but not broad, the\ncostal spot of the band, the large tooth above the apex of the cell and the one below the cell-end being vividly silvery like the marginal lunules ; the broad interspace between the median band and the marginal lunules is leatheryellow and bears below the apex and above the anal angle two large dark cinnamon clouds; obsolescent silvery selenia bands extend from the costal and abdominal margins towards the centre of the wing.\n\nThe species is widespread across central and northern Europe, North America, and through Asia to Korea. Specifically, it can be found in places like Germany, the United Kingdom, and Sweden and in the Midwestern United States in places like Iowa and the Dakotas. In the United Kingdom, \"Boloria selene\" is widespread across upland and western Britain, but is not found in central, eastern England or Ireland. Its range appears to be stable through much of Europe but declines have been reported in at least nine countries, such as England.\n\nThis species is found across Europe and North America in grassland environments where native violets grow. It occurs in damp, grassy habitats, woodland clearings and moorland, but has also been found in dune slacks and coastal cliffs.\n\nThe larvae of this species hatch in the late summer to early fall. They feed exclusively on violets and are active mostly at night. In drier areas, dog violets are used while in wetter areas the species feeds on bog violets (\"Viola palustris\") or marsh violets growing among purple moor-grass or tufted hair-grass. They prefer the damper areas. They also occur among bracken, which provides shade for the appropriate violet species. The caterpillars overwinter by hibernating, and then reemerge in the spring to finish growth and pupate. However, recent studies have shown that times of laying, hatching, and reemerging vary by temperature, and all life cycle stages appear to be strongly linked to the timing of the seasons. This effect is a suspected form of plastic behavior seen in many species of insects, especially ones in temperate climates that experience large temperature changes due to a change in seasons.\n\nCaterpillars pupate between mid May and August. When the larvae forms the pupa, or chrysalis, it is formed with its head down. This transformative stage lasts about two to three weeks.\n\nAdults mate and lay eggs in the spring on or in the near vicinity of violets. A common violet selected for oviposition is the Marsh Violet. Adult \"Boloria selene\" have been observed to fly in a brood once a year sometime in the summer. Adult Small pearl-bordered fritillaries feed on the following plants:\n\nThis species is well known to migrate short distances during its reproductive stage, but does not appear to make any long distance migrations that cross over unsuitable habitats such as farmland and urban areas.\n\nSmall birds appear to be major predators of both larval and adult stages, including introduced ground birds such as pheasants that were introduced in the UK for sport hunting (in quantities of almost 40 million birds according to a study done on ground birds' impact on local wildlife). However, no major decline was detected from the introduced predators alone, as there was no significance between reduced adult emergence and increased ground birds. In a study of ambush bugs, \"Boloria selene\" was identified as a prey, although predation rates were not studied.\n\nA study using North American populations found that sibling mating events of this species almost always result in unviable offspring. Even hybrids that were crossed with individuals from parent populations often had unviable offspring. This indicates that this species requires non-kin mating to survive, which may help with decreasing inbreeding events. Certain larvae did better in their home environments and struggled in foreign environments, indicating potential local adaptation. There were also slight coloration changes between males in Massachusetts (a “warm leathery tone”) and males in South Dakota (a “chestnut brown” color), indicating potential genetic differences between the two populations, which are separated by unsuitable habitat and by a distance of 2000 miles (3218.688 km). However, due to the age of the study, more work is needed to confirm that local adaptation is indeed taking place in North American populations of small pearl-bordered fritillaries instead of individual plasticity.\n\nAnother study found \"Boloria selene\" are quite plastic in their response to temperature variation, and will adjust much of their life cycle in response to temperature changes such as an earlier warming that comes with an early spring. The same study also analyzed among and between population data, and suggested that these animals quickly capitalize on early warming and late cooling regardless of location (in the US at least), and seem to also know when to wait longer or shorter before beginning reproduction.\n\nThere appears to be no place (at least in Europe) that is not suffering from at least light population degradation. Many studies in the UK (where population loss is most severe) and several studies from other areas of Europe state that the small pearl-bordered fritillary is rapidly declining in numbers. This is likely from indirect harm due to habitat destruction and fragmentation. Since this species is primarily attached to violet that grows in wild grasslands, modern agricultural practices which have caused most of Europe's grasslands to become fragmented or destroyed for farmland have a severe effect on the butterfly. Without native violets to host their larvae, this species is facing decline across Europe. This species also struggles with breeding across habitat fragments as it must lay eggs exclusively on violets in order to have any viable offspring. However, adults seem to be quite flexible in their movement patterns, with one study stating that only 45% of released \"Boloria selene\" specimens were able to be found and recaptured. This indicates that farmland itself appears to more strongly damage reproduction rates instead of general adult survival.\n\nAnother study found that this species has another characteristic which makes it vulnerable to extinction: it is not only a dietary specialist, also migrates only small distances. This creates problems for the species, since fragmentation most strongly affects animals that migrate short distances and are unable to cross the gaps made by human habitat destruction. While long distance migratory species are often unaffected and sedentary species are often able to better use the fragments they are in, short distance migrators like the small pearl-bordered fritillary are unable to properly disperse and are hit hardest from environmental damage.\n\nA study in Germany found that over 40 years (1971-2011), populations of adults dropped rapidly in agricultural land, while dropping slightly less severely in native grasslands (although still decreasing by almost 83%). The article stated that fragmented habitat protection does a poor job of securing biodiversity and protecting many species that are in peril, as it does not account for many species that cannot seek extra fragmented breeding sites. Many species, including \"Boloria selene\", fail to find good nesting sites as they cannot pass through the human habitat that divides suitable fragments.\n\nThese drastic changes stem from the continued expansion of agriculture over time that continued to damage and degrade the remaining native breeding habitat for \"Boloria selene\". However, the species seems to fare well as adults in a variety of artificial and natural habitats, with the same study showing slightly larger numbers of the species in farmland than in wild habitat in 1971. Another big issue is that \"Boloria selene\" struggles with sibling mating, as shown when almost no viable offspring came from sibling mating. This could be detrimental to a population that already has reduced individual genetic diversity, as sibling mating will become more common as fragmentation chips away at short distance migration and gene flow in this species.\n\n<nowiki></nowiki>\n\n"}

The underside of the wings have a row of silver-pearly markings along the edge, which give the species its name. The pearl-bordered fitillary is often confused with the small pearl-bordered fritillary, but can be distinguished by the triangle along its pearl border (the small pearl-bordered has black chevrons) as well as the presence of a single silver spot in the middle of a row of yellow spots. The female has darker markings and rounder wings than the male. The caterpillars are black with white or yellow spines along their backs.\n\nLike other species of fritillary, the males have special scent glands on their wings so that they can be recognised by females of their own species and therefore find a suitable partner.\n\n\"A. euphrosyne\" L. (= \"niobe\" Mull.) (67h). Very similar to the preceding species , especially \"selene\", but brighter red and the black markings thinner in typical specimens. Easily recognized by the hindwing beneath, which is bright brick-red at the base, not brown as in selene, the median band bearing only one silver-spot (across the apex of the cell) and the incomplete silvery band in the distal area being replaced by some yellow smears without any silvery gloss. The silvery marginal spots of the hindwing beneath are but very rarely\nabsent.\nThe pearl-bordered fritillary is widespread throughout Europe, ranging from Scandinavia to northern Spain and from Ireland eastwards across the Palearctic to Russia and to the north of Kazakhstan. In England and Wales (plus another 10 countries) it has declined rapidly in number and is a highly threatened species.\n\n\nAfter mating, the female will lay her eggs on dead bracken (\"Pteridium aquilinum\"), or leaf litter near to violet plants – common dog–violet (\"Viola riviniana\"), heath dog–violet (\"Viola canina\") or marsh violet (\"Viola palustris\"). Sometimes eggs are laid on the leaves of the food plant itself. They are laid singly, not in one large group such as the marsh fritillary. The habitat mosaics they prefer are typically one–third grass and two–thirds bracken.\n\nEggs can be found on the food plant from mid–May to the end of June. They are a pale yellow and can hatch after 10–14 days.\n\nThe emerging caterpillars begin feeding immediately and will moult three times within the first 5–6 weeks. Each caterpillar will then hibernate in a shriveled leaf at the base of the plant, usually moving to the hibernation site at the end of July. The caterpillars lose half of their body mass by the time the emerge in the following March. After a period of feeding and growth, during which it moults one last time, the caterpillar is full size and ready to pupate. The chrysalis stage is formed among the leaf litter, and lasts just 10–14 days.\n\nThe adult butterfly flies between late April and June, and is one of the earliest fritillaries to emerge. Adults feed on the nectar from early spring flowers such as bugle, dandelion, and lesser celandine.\n\nThere is a second brood during August.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2218661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218661", "title": "Werner (comics)", "text": "Werner (comics)\n\nWerner is a German comics character, appearing in a number of German comic books and animated films. He was created in 1978 by Brösel (Rötger Feldmann). Werner is the most successful German comic character of all time with over 10 million books sold and over 13 million film admissions. At almost 5 million admissions in Germany, the first movie, \"Werner – Beinhart!\" (1990), is Germany's third most commercially successful film of the 1990s on the German domestic market, and #14 of Germany's most successful domestic market films of all time.\n\nPrior to \"Oder Was?\", the first standalone \"Werner\" book published in 1981, since the late 1970s the \"Werner\" comics appeared in the German satirical magazine . Indeed, \"Oder was?\" was but a collection of the \"Werner\" comics that had been published in \"Pardon\" by then.\n\nThe \"Werner\" books are known for their anarchic humour, often based on Northern German dialects and puns. Standard High German is rarely spoken in the books, when it is used it is usually to portray the speaker as overtly formal and square, whereas most characters employ accents and dialects placed in a lingual continuum between the common modern Northern pronunciation of High German.\n\nThe character of Werner is based on Brösel's and his brother Andi's experiences. Werner's life is that of an unemployed biker that consists of souping up his motorcycle and consuming large amounts of beer (known as \"Bölkstoff\" in the comics). Both regularly gets him in trouble with the police and the German vehicle safety agency TÜV who due to their expressed incompetency and imbecility are usually ignored and duped by Werner. In the movies, Werner is voiced by Northern German band Torfrock's singer Klaus Büchner (whereas Torfrock also wrote part of the original soundtrack of the first movie, and partly did for the sequels as well).\n\nIn his younger years, Werner was apprentice to plumber \"Meister\" Walter Röhrich – the situations and characters in these stories are based on Brösel's brother Andi's apprenticeship years. In the movies, Röhrich is voiced by Andi, based upon the parodies he had done of his plumber \"Meister\" in real life ever since his apprenticeship.\n\nDue to the master craftsman being a dim-witted, crackpot tyrant, the Röhrich stories involve a lot of slapstick and comical relief. As written by Thomas Platt in the making-of book to the first movie \"Werner – Beinhart!\", Röhrich's explosive plumbing works \"usually end in devastation rather than installation\" (\"\"Explosion statt Installation\"\"), for indeed Röhrich's working sites often look like hit by an airstrike when he is done accidentally blowing up whole buildings or covering city blocks in sewage content. In \"Werner – Volles Rooäää!!!\", Röhrich even manages to accidentally launch a client into outer space.\n\nIn-between Röhrich and Werner in rank is Röhrich's journeyman Eckat (from \"Eckhardt\"). Eckat is considerably smarter than Röhrich and occasionally he jokes with Werner about Röhrich's incompetency behind his back, but Eckat is mostly loyal to his \"Meister\" whenever Röhrich is around.\n\nIt is not quite clear though whether Werner's apprenticeship years are really a thing of the past as stories involving occasional working for Röhrich remain a mainstay within the Werner comics. \n\nRöhrich's full company name (or company slogan) is \"Firma Röhrich, Gas, Wasser, Sanitär \"(\"Röhrich company – Gas, Water, Sanitation\"), parodied by Eckat as\" Firma Röhrich, Gas, Wasser, Scheiße\" (\"Röhrich company – Gas, water, shit\"); the latter three words (\"Gas, Wasser, Scheiße\") have become a humorous synonym for plumbing companies and plumbing works in Northern German slang due to the first movie's popularity. A common catchphrase of Röhrich's is \"\"Ich glaub', die Russen sind da!\"\" (approximately \"The Russians have arrived!\") which has become a phrase synonymous to \"the end of the world\" in German since WWII, but Röhrich even goes so far as that he has Werner and Eckat seek for imaginary \"Russians\" hiding in his cellar.\n\nWerner is a member of the biker and rocker club \"MC Klappstuhl\" (folding chair) led by their \"Präsi\" (short for \"Präsident\", \"president\") partly based upon band Torfrock's guitarist and singer Raymond Voss (who also voices the \"Präsi\" in the movies). Due to his choleric temper, the \"Präsi\" has little tolerance for cops or other people hindering them in their free-wheeling biker lifestyle. Being a roughneck and firebrand better not to mess with, when angered he will stereotypically bellow out that he'll \"count to one\" and then he and his gang will wreck the place down (\"\"Ich zähl' bis oins, und denn is Achterbahn!\"\") – which usually happens on the spot. In more recent stories, the \"Präsi\" even partly turns into a werewolf for comical effect during his notorious anger fits. If the \"Präsi\" gets too much out of control, several \"MC Klappstuhl\" members have to hold him down and feed him Sago as a kind of rage antidote.\n\nAnother important member is the vice president \"Herbert\". He is the exact opposite of \"Präsi\": he always speaks with a scary calm voice.\n\nOther members of \"MC Klappstuhl\" include Röhre (lit. \"Tube\") who modified his bike into a mobile coffee machine (in order to cure common beer hangovers), and Walze (\"Barrel\") who drives a large mobile beer tub.\n\nAndi is Werner's brother, basically a comic-book version of Brösel's real-life brother of the same name (who also voices Andi in the movies).\n\nBruno and Helmut are the series' commonly appearing two police officers. A kind of Laurel and Hardy pairing, Bruno is short, chubby, and very anal about all kinds of laws and regulations, while getting Werner and Andi locked up for any of their various misdemeanors (such as speeding, drunk driving, and illegal vehicle modifications) is his eternal dream, whereas Helmut is tall, skinny, and asinine, usually helpless when he is not ordered around by Bruno. Considering himself righteous law incarnate (\"\"denkt, er ist der Staat\"\", as the official \"Werner\" website puts it), pedantic Bruno is scared only by the \"Präsi\". Their characters are illustrated well in a short story included in \"Werner Eiskalt\", where Bruno orders Helmut to \"measure the phon volume\" of Werner's chopper bike's tail pipe in order to prove that it violates disturbance regulations. Helmut then uses a folding rule to measure the flame and smoke shooting from the pipe, and loyally reports to his superior Bruno that it's \"ten meters fifty of phon\".\n\nHolgi, based upon another real-life acquaintance of the Feldmann brothers, is Werner's and Andi's rival. Holgi is a fanatic Porsche lover, considering his car far superior to any motorbike as those fancied by most other characters in the series. In fact, above-mentioned \"Red Porsche Killer\" was designed especially for a race against Holgi that first occurred in the comic book \"Werner Eiskalt\" (1985), and in 1988 even became a real-life event between Brösel and Holgi with thousands of \"Werner\" fans gathering for the race at Hartenholm. The race was repeated in 2004 at the Lausitzring and another repeat is planned for end August 2018 at the original location.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is known for being Great Britain's most threatened butterfly and is listed as a vulnerable species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Like other fritillaries it is dependent on warm climates with violet rich flora.\n\nThe high brown fritillary's wingspan is on average around 65 mm. Its upper wings are orange with black markings and the undersides are colored a duller orange with white and brown markings. While flying it is very hard to distinguish from the dark green fritillary which has many of the same markings. The male and female fritillary share many of the same physical features.\n\nLarvae are brown with a single longitudinal white stripe down the length of their body. Their bodies are covered in brown spikes which aid in camouflaging them from predators as they move among dead fern fronds.\n\n\"A. adippe\" L. (= \"berecynthia\" Poda, \"cydippe\" L.) (69d). Usually larger than the previous species [ \"Argynnis alexandra\" Ménetries, 1832], the wings\nmore obtuse, the outer margin of the forewing quite straight and that of the hindwing feebly undulate in the female.\nEasily recognized by the thickened hairy streaks placed in the male on the branches of the median vein on the forewing. Beneath the silver-spots are much larger than in \"niobe\", particularly the marginal spots are much longer and broader.\n\nThis butterfly has many subspecies that span across Europe and throughout Asia and Africa, given that there are temperate temperatures in those regions. Northern Europe has seen a severe decline in fritillary population but it is still relatively abundant in other parts of Europe.\n\nAs of 2015, the high brown fritillary was the most threatened British butterfly species. Populations remain in four areas in Great Britain. The Morecambe Bay Limestone hills, the Glamorgan Brackenlands, Dartmoor and Exmoor all support a fritillary population, while it has declined in most other Northern European regions.\n\nThere are two main habitats that support high brown fritillary populations: bracken and limestone outcrops. Bracken habitats are found across its geographic range but limestone outcrops are specific to Great Britain.\n\nThese habitats are usually at lower altitudes in open fields and are found across the fritillarys complete range, usually facing in a southern direction. Their flora is not very diverse, and is limited to common ivies, tormentil, wood anemone and violets. Breeding areas are bracken dominated, with dead bracken leaves littering the ground. Grassy areas often intersperse these habitats.\n\nIn spring, habitat covered in dead bracken typically also has less dense grass cover, allowing the temperature in these areas to be significantly higher than surrounding areas. Increased temperature allows larvae to mature more quickly here, making bracken-rich habitats favorable breeding sites.\n\nThese habitats are specific to Great Britain, especially to the limestone soils of the Morecambe Bay. These outcrops are usually created by human intervention and land management. Breeding persists on limestone soil or near bracken. Throughout the rest of Great Britain populations are restricted to thick Bracken clumps.\n\nUnlike other species fritillary larvae ignore their egg shells as a food source and instead primarily feed on violet seedlings. They focus on younger growth and remain among food plants, eating heavily before metamorphosis.\n\nAdult fritillaries do not have a very diverse set of plants from which they feed. Both the female and male feed primary on bramble blossom and common knapweed. Fritillaries have also been observed feeding on different thistle species, betony, and ragwort. Local gardens are also commonly frequented as \"Buddleja\" is a popular choice among fritillaries as well.\n\nEggs are lain singly in mid-July up till winter's start, overwinter, and hatch in mid-March. Observation of fritillary egg laying is difficult as the eggs are very similar in color to the female's ovipositor. It has been seen that eggs may not even be laid after extensive enquiry by the female of potential egg sites. Females also prefer to lay eggs that are on firm ground rather than ground with loose plant matter. In outcrops eggs are laid in short vegetation next to limestone that offers good moss cover. In Bracken eggs are laid in groups in the midst of thick Bracken clumps. Dead Bracken litter is a popular site for egg laying, as well as moss and other decaying vegetation.\n\nOnce the larvae of the high brown fritillary emerge from the shell in mid-March, they begin to feed, usually on violets, almost immediately. When not feeding, which it spends the majority of its time doing, the larvae hide themselves among vegetation. They are diurnal and very temperature dependent. They frequently bask in sunlight to raise their body temperature higher than the surrounding vegetation allowing for faster growth. Eggs are laid in spots conducive to sun bathing, and the larvae gravitate towards spots warmed by sun and vegetation. During abnormally high temperatures the larvae hide under plant matter in-between feeding.\n\nBefore pupation the larvae form a shroud like structure from leaves and spin a section of silk from the top. This occurs usually around June. The larvae then suspend themselves and enter their pupal stage, which lasts for approximately a month, although this estimate is very temperature dependent. There is not extensive research on the subject.\n\nThe adult fritillary only has one brood a year, as they are a univoltine species. They can be seen flying from late June to late August, or even in certain Limestone areas, till September. Elsewhere they have a shorter flying season, from only mid-June to early August. In warm weather the fritillary is most active, and spends most of its time flying low to the ground above and around Bracken and other flora.\n\nThe egg laying process begins when a female does low passes above bracken fronds and drop down when they find a suitable spot. Females will then crawl on the bracken littered ground and use their abdomens to probe for likely egg laying spots. Eggs are normally laid once a female crawls over a plant that can serve as a food resource. Eggs may also be laid without any area observation, and without any food plants nearby, as females have been observed to lay eggs within seconds of landing. False egg laying is also common.\n\nThe high brown fritillary population, especially in Great Britain, is extremely threatened. It is extinct in over 90% of its former geographic range, making it a high priority for conservation efforts. The British decline of the fritillary can be attributed to novel changes in land management, increasing during the 20th century.\n\nFritillaries in woodland habitats have been most severally affected by habitat loss. These butterflies relied heavily on coppicing, a land managing technique that has all but disappeared from Great Britain's countryside. The reduction of coppicing combined with replanting and new forest growth has several limited the places the fritillary can thrive, as bracken habitats are becoming rarer. Within bracken habitats, population loss is driven when bracken growth is too extreme or grazing animals trample the flora associated with the butterfly.\n\nIn order to reverse the decline of the high brown fritillary, conservation plans focusing on bracken habitat management are the primary course of action. Bracken sites are in the process of being assessed to see which steps could be taken next. path cutting between patches. The high brown fritillary remains one of the Butterfly Conservation's highest priority projects.\n\nBugle, bramble and thistle flowers are favourite nectar sources for the adult.\n\nThe species was once widespread in the United Kingdom but has now greatly declined. It has legal protection in the UK under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act.\n\n"}

It was co-written by Carey and Babyface. It was produced by Carey, Babyface, and Daryl Simmons for Carey's third studio album, \"Music Box\" (1993). It was released as the fourth single from \"Music Box\" in the first quarter of 1994, as a double A-side with a cover of Badfinger's \"Without You\". Lyrically, the song's protagonist describes her ex-lover and although they have since moved on, she will never forget them. The song was remixed for single release by Jermaine Dupri, who has since collaborated with Carey on several tracks on almost all her albums since \"Daydream\". No music video was commissioned for the song, making it Carey's first commercially released single not to be accompanied by a video.\n\nEntertainment Weekly editor David Browne wrote that this song is a \"faceless ballad that wastes the talents of R&B producer Babyface.\"\n\nAt the time of the single's release in the U.S. as \"Without You/Never Forget You,\" \"Billboard\" magazine's rules allowed double-sided singles to chart together as one entry on the singles chart. A song that picked up the most airplay and/or sales for the respective chart was listed as the A-side. On the U.S. pop charts, it was listed as \"Without You/Never Forget You\" and reached number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, remaining in the top forty for 21 weeks.\n\nThe maxi-single of \"Never Forget You\" was only released in the United States and promoted to Urban radio audiences, charting as the A-side when it appeared on the R&B charts. As \"Never Forget You/Without You,\" it reached the top ten on \"Billboard\"'s Hot R&B Singles chart primarily due to sales, and the RIAA certified it gold.\n\nJermaine Dupri's R&B remixes of the song are included on its maxi-single release. A radio edit, an extended version and the instrumental version of the remix replace Babyface's original production with a new, pulsating synthetic R&B rhythm.

{"id": "2218675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218675", "title": "Bride kidnapping", "text": "Bride kidnapping\n\nBride kidnapping, also known as bridenapping, marriage by abduction or marriage by capture, is a practice in which a man abducts the woman he wishes to marry. The woman is enslaved by her abductor, raped and taken as his wife. Later she may suffer different types of violence.\n\nBride kidnapping has been practiced around the world and throughout prehistory and history. It continues to occur in countries in Central Asia, the Caucasus region, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, India, Pakistan, Ethiopia and other parts of Africa, and among peoples as diverse as the Hmong in Southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, the Romani in Europe, and tribes in the amazon jungle in South America.\n\nIn most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a sex crime rather than a valid form of marriage. Some types of it may also be seen as falling along the continuum between forced marriage and arranged marriage. The term is sometimes confused with elopements, in which a couple runs away together and seeks the consent of their parents later. In some cases, the woman cooperates with the kidnapping, typically in an effort to save face for herself or her parents. Even when the practice is against the law, judicial enforcement remains lax in some areas. Bride kidnapping still occurs in various parts of the world, but it is most common in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Bride kidnapping is often (but not always) a form of child marriage. It may be connected to the practice of bride price, and the inability or unwillingness to pay it.\n\nBride kidnapping is distinguished from \"raptio\" in that the former refers to the abduction of one woman by one man (and his friends and relatives), and is still a widespread practice, whereas the latter refers to the large scale abduction of women by groups of men, possibly in a time of war (see also war rape). Any way there is a continuum between both phenomena, for example women abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Lord Resistance Army in Uganda and ISIS in the Middle East have been taken as wives by their abductors.\n\nSome cultures today (such as Circassians) maintain symbolic bride kidnapping ritual as part of traditions surrounding a wedding, in a nod to the practice of bride kidnapping which may have or may have not figured in that culture's history. According to some sources, the honeymoon is a relic of marriage by capture, based on the practice of the husband going into hiding with his wife to avoid reprisals from her relatives, with the intention that the woman would be pregnant by the end of the month.\nThough the motivations behind bride kidnapping vary by region, the cultures with traditions of marriage by abduction are generally patriarchal with a strong social stigma on sex or pregnancy outside marriage and illegitimate births.\n\nIn some modern cases, the couple collude together to elope under the guise of a bride kidnapping, presenting their parents with a \"fait accompli\". In most cases, however, the men who resort to capturing a wife are often of lower social status, because of poverty, disease, poor character or criminality. They are sometimes deterred from legitimately seeking a wife because of the payment the woman's family expects, the bride price (not to be confused with a dowry, paid by the \"woman's\" family).\n\nIn agricultural and patriarchal societies, where bride kidnapping is most common, children work for their family. A woman leaves her birth family, geographically and economically, when she marries, becoming instead a member of the groom's family. (See patrilocality for an anthropological explanation.) Due to this loss of labour, the women's families do not want their daughters to marry young, and demand economic compensation (the aforementioned bride price) when they do leave them. This conflicts with the interests of men, who want to marry early, as marriage means an increase in social status, and the interests of the groom's family, who will gain another pair of hands for the family farm, business or home. Depending on the legal system under which she lives, the consent of the woman may not be a factor in judging the validity of the marriage.\n\nIn addition to the issue of forced marriage, bride kidnapping may have other negative effects on the young women and their society. For example, fear of kidnap is cited as a reason for the lower participation of girls in the education system.\n\nThe mechanism of marriage by abduction varies by location. This article surveys the phenomenon by region, drawing on common cultural factors for patterns, but noting country-level distinctions.\n\nIn three African countries, bride kidnapping often takes the form of abduction followed by rape. \n\nBride-kidnapping is prevalent in areas of Rwanda. Often the abductor kidnaps the woman from her household or follows her outside and abducts her. He and his companions may then rape the woman to ensure that she submits to the marriage. The family of the woman either then feels obliged to consent to the union, or is forced to when the kidnapper impregnates her, as pregnant women are not seen as eligible for marriage. The marriage is confirmed with a ceremony that follows the abduction by several days. In such ceremonies, the abductor asks his bride's parents to forgive him for abducting their daughter. The man may offer a cow, money, or other goods as restitution to his bride's family.\n\nBride-kidnap marriages in Rwanda often lead to poor outcomes. Human rights workers report that one third of men who abduct their wives abandon them, leaving the wife without support and impaired in finding a future marriage. Additionally, with the growing frequency of bride-kidnapping, some men choose not to solemnize their marriage at all, keeping their \"bride\" as a concubine.\n\nBride kidnapping is not specifically outlawed in Rwanda, though violent abductions are punishable as rape. According to a criminal justice official, bride kidnappers are virtually never tried in court: \"When we hear about abduction, we hunt down the kidnappers and arrest them and sometimes the husband, too. But we're forced to let them all go several days later,\" says an official at the criminal investigation department in Nyagatare, the capital of Umutara. Women's rights groups have attempted to reverse the tradition by conducting awareness raising campaigns and by promoting gender equity, but the progress has been limited so far.\n\nThere have been cases of Coptic Christian women and girls abducted, forced to convert to Islam and then married to Muslim men. The practice has increased with the rise of Salafist networks under president Abdel Fattah Saeed Hussein Khalil el-Sisi, who, pay as much as $3000 for every Coptic Christian woman that is being kidnapped, raped and married to a Muslim man.\n\nBride kidnapping is prevalent in many regions of Ethiopia. According to surveys conducted in 2003 by the National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethiopia, the custom's prevalence rate was estimated at 69 percent nationally, and highest in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region at 92 percent. A man working in co-ordination with his friends may kidnap a girl or woman, sometimes using a horse to ease the escape. The abductor will then hide his intended bride or bringer her to his family, and rape her, sometimes in front of his family, until she becomes pregnant. As the father of the woman's child, the man can claim her as his wife. Subsequently, the kidnapper may try to negotiate a bride price with the village elders to legitimize the marriage. Girls as young as eleven years old are reported to have been kidnapped for the purpose of marriage. Though Ethiopia criminalised such abductions and raised the marriageable age to 18 in 2004, this law has not been well implemented. A 2016 UNICEF evidence review (based on data from 2010 and 2013) estimated that 10 to 13 percent of marriages in the highest risk areas involved abduction, with rates of 1.4 percent to 2.4 percent in lower risk areas of the country.\n\nThe bride of the forced marriage may suffer from the psychological and physical consequences of forced sexual activity and early pregnancy, and the early end to her education. Women and girls who are kidnapped may also be exposed to sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\n\nForced marriages continue to be a problem for young girls in Kenya. The United States Department of State reports that children and young teenaged girls (aged ten and up) are sometimes married to men two decades older.\n\nMarriage by abduction used to be, and to some extent still is, a customary practice for the Kisii ethnic group. In their practice, the abductor kidnaps the woman forcibly and rapes her in an attempt to impregnate her. The \"bride\" is then coerced through the stigma of pregnancy and rape to marry her abductor. Though most common in the late 19th century through the 1960s, such marriage abductions still occur occasionally.\n\nThe Turkana tribe in Kenya also practised marriage by abduction. In this culture, bridal kidnapping (\"akomari\") occurred before any formal attempts to arrange a marriage with a bride's family. According to one scholar, a successful bridal kidnapping raised the abductor's reputation in his community, and allowed him to negotiate a lower bride price with his wife's family. Should an attempted abductor fail to seize his bride, he was bound to pay a bride price to the woman's family, provide additional gifts and payments to the family, and to have an arranged marriage (\"akota\").\n\nThe practice is known as ukuthwalwa or simply thwala in among the nguni speaking tribes. The Basotho call it Tjhobediso. Among Zulu people, thwala, or bride abduction, was once an acceptable way for two young people in love to get married when their families opposed the match (and so actually a form of elopement). Thwala has been abused, however, \"to victimize isolated rural women and enrich male relatives.\"\n\nIn Central Asia, bride kidnapping exists in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Karakalpakstan, an autonomous region of Uzbekistan. Though origin of the tradition in the region is disputed, the rate of nonconsensual bride kidnappings appears to be increasing in several countries throughout Central Asia as the political and economic climate changes.\n\nDespite its illegality, with the practice being subjected to stricter crackdowns in 2013, which punish it by a prison sentences of up to 10 years, in many primarily rural areas, bride kidnapping, known as \"ala kachuu\" (to take and flee), is an accepted and common way of taking a wife. However, the United Nations Development Programme disputes that bride kidnapping is part of the country's culture or tradition, and considers it a human rights violation.\n\nA recent victimization survey in Kyrgyzstan (2015) included the crime of kidnapping of young women for marriage. Fourteen percent of married women answered that they were kidnapped at the time and that two-thirds of these cases were consensual, the woman knew the man and had agreed with it up front. This means that about five percent of current marriages in Kyrgyzstan are cases of 'Ala Kachuu'.\n\nThere is another source that mentions much higher numbers. Approximately half of all Kyrgyz marriages include bride kidnapping; of those kidnappings, two-thirds are non-consensual. Research by non-governmental organizations give estimates from a low of 40% to between 68 and 75 percent of all marriages in Kyrgyzstan involved bride kidnapping.\n\nBride kidnappings that involve rape do so to psychologically force the would-be bride to accept her kidnapper and his family's pressure to marry him, since if she then refuses she would never be considered marriageable again. Of 12,000 yearly bride kidnappings in Kyrgyzstan, approximately 2,000 women reported that their kidnapping involved rape by the would-be groom. The matter is somewhat confused by the local use of the term \"bride kidnap\" to reflect practices along a continuum, from forcible abduction and rape (and then, almost unavoidably, marriage), to something akin to an elopement arranged between the two young people, to which both sets of parents have to consent after the act.\n\nAlthough the practice is illegal in Kyrgyzstan, bride kidnappers are rarely prosecuted. This reluctance to enforce the code is in part caused by the pluralistic legal system in Kyrgyzstan where many villages are \"de facto\" ruled by councils of elders and \"aqsaqal\" courts following customary law, away from the eyes of the state legal system. \"Aqsaqal\" courts, tasked with adjudicating family law, property and torts, often fail to take bride kidnapping seriously. In many cases, \"aqsaqal\" members are invited to the kidnapped bride's wedding and encourage the family of the bride to accept the marriage.\n\nIn Kazakhstan, bride kidnapping (\"alyp qashu\") is divided into non-consensual and consensual abductions, \"kelisimsiz alyp qashu\" (\"to take and run without agreement\") and \"kelissimmen alyp qashu\" (\"to take and run with agreement\"), respectively. Though some kidnappers are motivated by the wish to avoid a bride price or the expense of hosting wedding celebrations or a feast to celebrate the girl leaving home, other would-be husbands fear the woman's refusal, or that the woman will be kidnapped by another suitor first. Generally, in nonconsensual kidnappings, the abductor uses either deception (such as offering a ride home) or force (such as grabbing the woman, or using a sack to restrain her) to coerce the woman to come with him. Once at the man's house, one of his female relatives offers the woman a kerchief (\"oramal\") that signals the bride's consent to the marriage. Though in consensual kidnappings, the woman may agree with little hesitation to wear the kerchief, in non-consensual abductions, the woman may resist the kerchief for days. Next, the abductor's family generally asks the \"bride\" to write a letter to her family, explaining that she had been taken of her own free will. As with the kerchief, the woman may resist this step adamantly. Subsequently, the \"groom\" and his family generally issues an official apology to the bride's family, including a letter and a delegation from the groom's household. At this time, the groom's family may present a small sum to replace the bride-price. Though some apology delegations are met cordially, others are greeted with anger and violence. Following the apology delegation, the bride's family may send a delegation of \"pursuers\" (\"qughysnshy\") either to retrieve the bride or to verify her condition and honour the marriage.\n\nA recent victimization survey in Kazakhstan (2018) included the crime of kidnapping of young women for marriage. 4% of married women answered that they were kidnapped at the time and that two-thirds of these cases were consensual, the woman knew the man and had agreed with it up front. This means that about 1-1.5% of current marriages in Kazakhstan are the result of non-consensual abductions.\n\nIn Karakalpakstan, an autonomous region in Uzbekistan, nearly one fifth of all marriages are conducted by bride kidnapping. Activist groups in the region tie an increase in kidnappings to economic instability. Whereas weddings can be prohibitively expensive, kidnappings avoid both the cost of the ceremony and any bride price. Other scholars report that less desirable males with inferior educations or drug or alcohol problems are more likely to kidnap their brides. In Karakalpakstan, the bride kidnapping sometimes originates out of a dating relationship and, at other times, happens as an abduction by multiple people.\n\nBride kidnapping is an increasing trend in the countries and regions of the Caucasus, both in Georgia in the South and in Dagestan, Chechnya and Ingushetia in the North. In the Caucasian versions of bride-kidnapping, the kidnap victim's family may play a role in attempting to convince the woman to stay with her abductor after the kidnapping, because of the shame inherent in the presumed consummation of the marriage.\n\nThe Dagestan, Chechnya and Ingushetia regions in the Northern Caucasus (in Russia) have also witnessed an increase in bride kidnappings since the fall of the Soviet Union. As in other countries, kidnappers sometimes seize acquaintances to be brides and other times abduct strangers. The social stigma of spending a night in a male's house can be a sufficient motivation to force a young woman to marry her captor. Under Russian law, though a kidnapper who refuses to release his bride could be sentenced to eight to ten years, a kidnapper will not be prosecuted if he releases the victim or marries her with her consent. Bride captors in Chechnya are liable, in theory, to receive also a fine of up to 1 million rubles. As in the other regions, authorities often fail to respond to the kidnappings. In Chechnya, the police failure to respond to bridal kidnappings is compounded by a prevalence of abductions in the region. Several such kidnappings have been captured on video.\n\nResearchers and non-profit organisations describe a rise in bride kidnappings in the North Caucasus in the latter half of the 20th century. In Chechnya, women's rights organisations tie the increase in kidnappings to a deterioration of women's rights under the rule of Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, both marriage by capture (\"qız qaçırmaq\") and elopement (\"qoşulub qaçmaq\") are relatively common practices. In the Azeri kidnap custom, a young woman is taken to the home of the abductor's parents through either deceit or force. Regardless of whether rape occurs or not, the woman is generally regarded as impure by her relatives, and is therefore forced to marry her abductor. Despite a 2005 Azeri law that criminalised bride kidnapping, the practice places women in extremely vulnerable social circumstances, in a country where spousal abuse is rampant and recourse to law enforcement for domestic matters is impossible. In Azerbaijan, women abducted by bride kidnapping sometimes become slaves of the family who kidnap them.\n\nIn Georgia, bride kidnapping occurs in the south of the country. Although the extent of the problem is not known, non-governmental activists estimate that hundreds of women are kidnapped and forced to marry each year. In a typical Georgian model of bride kidnapping, the abductor, often accompanied by friends, accosts the intended bride, and coerces her through deception or force to enter a car. Once in the car, the victim may be taken to a remote area or the captor's home. These kidnappings sometimes include rape, and may result in strong stigma to the female victim, who is assumed to have engaged in sexual relations with her captor. Women who have been victims of bride kidnapping are often regarded with shame; the victim's relatives may view it as a disgrace if the woman returns home after a kidnapping. In other cases, the kidnapping is a consensual elopement. Human Rights Watch reports that prosecutors often refuse to bring charges against the kidnappers, urging the kidnap victim to reconcile with her aggressor. Enforcing the appropriate laws in this regard may also be a problem because the kidnapping cases often go unreported as a result of intimidation of victims and their families.\n\nAn estimated one thousand Christian and Hindu women are kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam and marry Muslim men every year in Pakistan.\n\nIn Bali tradition, Balinese men historically must abduct women for marrying.\n\nMarriage by abduction also occurs in traditional Hmong culture, in which it is known as \"zij poj niam\". As in some other cultures, bride kidnapping is generally a joint effort between the would-be groom and his friends and family. Generally, the abductor takes the woman while she is alone. The abductor then sends a message to the kidnap victim's family, informing them of the abduction and the abductor's intent to marry their daughter. If the victim's family manage to find the woman and insist on her return, they might be able to free her from the obligation to marry the man. However, if they fail to find the woman, the kidnap victim is forced to marry the man. The abductor still has to pay a bride price for the woman, generally an increased amount because of the kidnapping. Because of this increased cost (and the general unpleasantness of abduction), kidnapping is usually only a practice reserved for a man with an otherwise blemished chance of securing a bride, because of criminal background, illness or poverty.\n\nOccasionally, members of the Hmong ethnic group have engaged in bride kidnapping in the United States. In some cases, the defendant has been allowed to plead a cultural defense to justify his abduction. This defense has sometimes been successful. In 1985, Kong Moua, a Hmong man, kidnapped and raped a woman from a Californian college. He later claimed that this was an act of \"zij poj niam\" and was allowed to plead to false imprisonment only, instead of kidnapping and rape. The judge in this case considered cultural testimony as an explanation of the man's crime.\n\nUntil the 1940s, marriage by abduction, known as \"qiangqin\" (), occurred in rural areas of China. Though illegal in imperial China, for rural areas it often became a local \"institution\". According to one scholar, marriage by abduction was sometimes a groom's answer to avoid paying a bride price. In other cases, the scholar argues, it was a collusive act between the bride's parents and the groom to circumvent the bride's consent.\n\nChinese scholars theorise that this practice of marriage by abduction became the inspiration for a form of institutionalised public expression for women: the bridal lament. In imperial China, a new bride performed a two- to three-day public song, including chanting and sobbing, that listed her woes and complaints. The bridal lament would be witnessed by members of her family and the local community.\n\nIn recent years bride kidnapping has resurfaced in areas of China. In many cases, the women are kidnapped and sold to men in poorer regions of China, or as far abroad as Mongolia. Reports say that buying a kidnapped bride is nearly one tenth of the price of hosting a traditional wedding. The United States Department of State tie this trend of abducting brides to China's one-child policy, and the consequent gender imbalance as more male children are born than female children.\n\nAccording to the study by Kunio Yanagita, scholar of folklore in Japan, there are three patterns existed in bride kidnapping of Japan.\n\nIn Buraku of Kochi, there was the custom of bride kidnapping named \"katagu\" (かたぐ).\n\nThe practice of kidnapping children, teenagers and women from neighbouring tribes and adopting them into the new tribe was common among Native Americans throughout the Americas. The kidnappings were a way of introducing new blood into the group. Captured European women sometimes settled down as adopted members of the tribe and at least one woman, Mary Jemison, refused \"rescue\" when it was offered.\n\nSeveral reports of bride kidnapping for religious reasons have surfaced recently. Most known are the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart in Utah and the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard in California. Both perpetrators have been convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault. Other cases exist within some Mormon Fundamentalist communities around the Utah-Arizona border; however, accurate information is difficult to obtain from these closed communities. Most of these cases are usually referred to as forced marriages, although they are similar to other bride kidnappings around the world.\n\nAmong the Tzeltal community, a Mayan tribe in Chiapas, Mexico, bride kidnapping has been a recurring method of securing a wife. The Tzeltal people are an indigenous, agricultural tribe that is organised patriarchally. Premarital contact between the sexes is discouraged; unmarried women are supposed to avoid speaking with men outside their families. As with other societies, the grooms that engage in bride kidnapping have generally been the less socially desirable mates.\n\nIn the Tzeltal tradition, a girl is kidnapped by the groom, possibly in concert with his friends. She is generally taken to the mountains and raped. The abductor and his future bride often then stay with a relative until the bride's father's anger is reported to have subsided. At that point, the abductor will return to the bride's house to negotiate a bride-price, bringing with him the bride and traditional gifts such as rum.\n\nAmong the Mapuche of Chile, the practice was known as \"casamiento por capto\" in Spanish, and \"ngapitun\" in Mapudungun.\n\nHelena Valero, a Brazilian woman kidnapped by Amazonian Indians in 1937, dictated her story to an Italian anthropologist, who published it in 1965.\n\nBride kidnapping has been documented as a marital practice in some Romani community traditions. In the Romani culture, girls as young as twelve years old may be kidnapped for marriage to teenaged boys. As the Roma population lives throughout Europe, this practice has been seen on multiple occasions in Ireland, England, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Slovakia. The kidnapping has been theorised as a way to avoid a bride price or as a method of ensuring exogamy. The tradition's normalisation of kidnapping puts young women at higher risk of becoming victims of human trafficking.\n\nMarriage by capture was practised in ancient cultures throughout the Mediterranean area. It is represented in mythology and history by the tribe of Benjamin in the Bible; by the Greek hero Paris stealing the beautiful Helen of Troy from her husband Menelaus, thus triggering the Trojan War; and by the Rape of the Sabine Women by Romulus, the founder of Rome.\nIn 326 A.D., the Emperor Constantine issued an edict prohibiting marriage by abduction. The law made kidnapping a public offence; even the kidnapped bride could be punished if she later consented to a marriage with her abductor. Spurned suitors sometimes kidnapped their intended brides as a method of restoring honor. The suitor, in coordination with his friends, generally abducted his bride while she was out of her house in the course of her daily chores. The bride would then be secreted outside the town or village. Though the kidnapped woman was sometimes raped in the course of the abduction, the stain on her honor from a presumptive consummation of the marriage was sufficient to damage her marital prospects irreversibly. Sometimes, the \"abduction\" masked an elopement.\n\nThe custom of \"fuitina\" was widespread in Sicily and continental southern Italy. In theory and in some cases it was an agreed elopement between two youngsters; in practice it was often a forcible kidnapping and rape, followed by a so-called \"rehabilitating marriage\" (\"matrimonio riparatore\"). In 1965, this custom was brought to national attention by the case of Franca Viola, a 17-year-old abducted and raped by a local small-time criminal, with the assistance of a dozen of his friends. When she was returned to her family after a week, she refused to marry her abductor, contrary to local expectation. Her family backed her up, and suffered severe intimidation for their efforts; the kidnappers were arrested and the main perpetrator was sentenced to 11 years in prison.\n\nThe exposure of this \"archaic and intransigent system of values and behavioural mores\" caused great national debate. In 1968, Franca married her childhood sweetheart, with whom she would later have three children. Conveying clear messages of solidarity, Giuseppe Saragat, then president of Italy, sent the couple a gift on their wedding day, and soon afterwards, Pope Paul VI granted them a private audience. A 1970 film, \"La moglie più bella\" (\"The Most Beautiful Wife\") by Damiano Damiani and starring Ornella Muti, is based on the case. Viola never capitalised on her fame and status as a feminist icon, preferring to live a quiet life in Alcamo with her family.\n\nThe law allowing \"rehabilitating marriages\" to protect rapists from criminal proceedings was abolished in 1981.\n\nThe inciting incident for the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland was an instance of wife-stealing: in 1167, the King of Leinster Diarmait Mac Murchada had his lands and kingship revoked by order of the High King of Ireland, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair as punishment for abducting the wife of another king in 1152. This lead Diarmait to seek the assistance of King Henry II of England in order to reclaim his kingdom.\n\nThe abduction of heiresses was an occasional feature in Ireland until 1800, as illustrated in the film \"The Abduction Club\".\n\nIn 2015, Malta was criticized by Equality Now, for a law which, in certain circumstances, can extinguish the punishment for a man who abducts a woman if, following the abduction, the man and woman get married. (Article 199 and Article 200 of the Criminal Code of Malta) The article was ultimately abolished by Act XIII of 2018, Article 24.\n\nEast Slavic tribes, predecessor tribes to the Russian state, practised bride kidnapping in the eleventh century. The traditions were documented by Russian monk Nestor. According to his \"Chronicles\", the Drevlian tribe captured wives non-consensually, whereas the Radimich, Viatich, and Severian tribes \"captured\" their wives after having come to an agreement about marriage with them. The clergy's increase in influence may have helped the custom to abate.\n\nMarriage by capture occurred among the South Slavs until the beginning of the 1800s. Common in Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the custom was known as \"otmitza\". The practice was mentioned in a statute in the Politza, the 1605 Croatian legal code. According to leading intellectual and Serbian folk-chronicler Vuk Karadzic, a man would dress for \"battle\" before capturing a woman. Physical force was a frequent element of these kidnappings.\n\nBride kidnapping was also a custom in Bulgaria. With the consent of his parents and the aid of his friends, the abductor would accost his bride and take her to a barn away from the home, as superstition held that pre-marital intercourse might bring bad luck to the house. Whether or not the man raped his bride, the abduction would shame the girl and force her to stay with her kidnapper to keep her reputation. As in other cultures, sometimes couples would elope by staging false kidnappings to secure the parents' consent.\n\nIn Catholic canon law, the impediment of \"raptus\" specifically prohibits marriage between a woman abducted with the intent to force her to marry, and her abductor, as long as the woman remains in the abductor's power. According to the second provision of the law, should the woman decide to accept the abductor as a husband after she is safe, she will be allowed to marry him. The canon defines \"raptus\" as a \"violent\" abduction, accompanied by physical violence or threats, or fraud or deceit. The Council of Trent insisted that the abduction in \"raptus\" must be for the purpose of marriage to count as an impediment to marriage.\n\nIn Islam forced marriage is strictly prohibited and doesn't count as a marriage in the first place.\n\nBride capture has been reflected in feature films from many cultures, sometimes humorously, sometimes as social commentary.\n\nBride kidnapping is depicted as a frontier solution in the 1954 Hollywood musical \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\". The 1960 Hong Kong film \"Qiangpin\" (\"The Bride Hunter\") portrays the custom in the format of an all-female Yue opera comedy, in which Xia Meng plays a gender-bending role as a man masquerading as a woman. Bride kidnapping is displayed somewhat humorously in Pedro Almodóvar's 1990 Spanish hit \"¡Átame!\" (\"Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!\"), starring Antonio Banderas and Victoria Abril. It is the underlying theme behind the 2005 Korean movie \"The Bow\". In the 2006 comedy \"\", the eponymous fictional reporter Borat, played by British comedian/satirist Sacha Baron Cohen, attempts to kidnap Canadian actress Pamela Anderson in order to take her as his wife. He brings a \"wedding sack\" which he has made for the occasion, suggesting that such kidnappings are a tradition in his parody of Kazakhstan.\n\nOn a more serious note, a 1970 Italian film, \"La moglie più bella\" (\"The Most Beautiful Wife\") by Damiano Damiani and starring Ornella Muti, is based on the story of Franca Viola, described above. However, before the national debate caused by the Viola case, a 1964 satire directed by Pietro Germi, \"Seduced and Abandoned\" (\"Sedotta e abbandonata\"), treated the Sicilian custom as a dark comedy. The 2009 film \"Baarìa - la porta del vento\" shows a consensual \"fuitina\" in 20th-century Sicily (atypically having the couple enclosed in the girl's house) as the only way the lovers can avoid the girl's arranged marriage to a richer man.\n\nSome Russian films and literature depict bride kidnapping in the Caucasus. There is a Soviet comedy entitled \"Kidnapping, Caucasian Style\" (, literally translated as \"The Girl Prisoner of the Caucasus\"), where a bride kidnapping occurs in an unidentified Caucasian country. The 2007 Kyrgyz film \"Pure Coolness\" also revolves around the bride kidnapping custom, mistaken identity, and the clash between modern urban expectations and the more traditional countryside.\n\nIn 2005, a documentary film entitled \"Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan\" made by Petr Lom was presented at the UNAFF 2005 festival, and subsequently on PBS and Investigation Discovery (ID) in the United States. The film met controversy in Kyrgyzstan because of ethical concerns about the filming of real kidnappings.\n\nIn 2012, the website Vice.com did a full documentary film about bride kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nIn Frances Burney's novel, \"Camilla\" (1796), the heroine's sister, Eugenia, is kidnapped by an adventurer called Alphonso Bellamy. Eugenia decides to stay with her husband on the grounds that she believes her word is a solemn oath. Eugenia is fifteen years old, and so underage, and is coerced into the marriage—both were grounds for treating the marriage as illegal.\n\nA Sherlock Holmes story features bride kidnapping. In \"The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\", a woman is employed as a governess by a man who knows that she will soon inherit a fortune, with the intent of a confederate marrying her. The ceremony does eventually occur, but is void.\n\nThe manga Otoyomegatari \"A Bride's Story\" takes place in central Asia. The heroine is married to a boy in an outside clan, but regrets regarding this decision occur when her original clan has problems bearing heirs. Her birth family comes to retrieve her with the intention of marrying her to someone else, but without success. Her new family tells the invaders that the girl has been impregnated, which would be the last seal on the marriage. They doubt this has occurred as the groom is very young and, desperate, they resort to a kidnap attempt, but again fail.\n\nThe fantasy novel \"A Storm of Swords\" features marriage by capture (or \"stealing a woman\") as the traditional form of marriage north of the Wall. The Free Folk consider it a test for a man to \"steal\" a wife and outwit her attempts on his life long enough for her to respect his strength and come to love him. More often, though, marriages by capture are conducted between a couple already in love, an elopement without the extra element of attempted murder. Jon Snow and Ygritte have such a marriage by capture, although at the time Jon was ignorant of the custom and thought he was merely taking her prisoner. The Ironborn are also known to practice this custom, taking secondary wives while reaving the mainland, which they refer to as \"salt wives\".\n\nThe Tamora Pierce fantasy novel The Will of the Empress includes bride kidnapping as a major plot point and has extensive discussions of the morality of bride kidnapping. Multiple characters are kidnapped for the purpose of marriage during the novel, which is used as a warning against it (in keeping with the women's rights focus of her series), particularly in the case of poor women or those without social support systems.\n\nIn the BBC radio and television comedy series \"The League of Gentlemen\", the character Papa Lazarou comes to the fictional town of Royston Vasey under the guise of a peg-seller. He seeks to kidnap women by entering their homes, talking gibberish to them (Gippog) and persuading them to hand over their wedding rings. He 'names' them all 'Dave', and, after obtaining their rings, proclaims; \"you're my wife now\".\nIn \"Criminal Minds\", season 4, episode 13 titled \"Bloodline\" depicts bride kidnapping.\n\nStephen Vincent Benét wrote a short story called \"The Sobbin' Women\" that parodied the legend of the rape of the Sabine women. Later adapted into the musical \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\", it tells the story of seven gauche but sincere backwoodsmen, one of whom gets married, encouraging the others to seek partners. After a social where they meet girls they are attracted to, they are denied the chance to pursue their courtship by the latter's menfolk. Following the Roman example, they abduct the girls. As in the original tale, the women are at first indignant but are eventually won over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2218687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218687", "title": "Common Interface", "text": "Common Interface\n\nIn Digital Video Broadcasting, the Common Interface (also called DVB-CI) is a technology which allows decryption of pay TV channels. Pay TV stations want to choose which encryption method to use. The Common Interface allows TV manufacturers to support many different pay TV stations, by allowing to plug in exchangeable conditional-access modules (CAM) for various encryption schemes.\n\nThe Common Interface is the connection between the TV tuner (TV or set-top box) and the module that decrypts the TV signal (CAM). This module, in turn, then accepts the pay-to-view subscriber card, which contains the access keys and permissions.\n\nThe host (TV or set-top box) is responsible for tuning to pay TV channels and demodulation of the RF signal, while CAM is responsible for CA descrambling. The Common Interface allows them to communicate with each other. All Common Interface equipment must comply with the EN 50221-1997 standard. This is a defined standard that enables the addition of a CAM in a DTV receiver to adapt it to different kinds of cryptography. The EN 50221 specification allows many types of modules but only the CAM has found popularity because of the pay TV market. Indeed, one of Digital Video Broadcasting's main strengths is the option of implementing the required conditional access capability on the Common Interface.\n\nThis allows broadcasters to use modules containing solutions from different suppliers, thus increasing their choice of anti-piracy options.\n\nA DVB receiver may have one or two slots implementing the Common Interface (CI). The CI uses the conditional-access module (PCMCIA) connector and conforms to the Common Scrambling Algorithm (CSA), the normative that specifies that such a receiver must be able to accept DES (Data Encryption Standard) keys in intervals of some milliseconds, and use them to decode private channels according to a specific algorithm.\n\nThose algorithms are proprietary to individual suppliers. Each one uses their own algorithms and there is no defined standard for them.\n\nAs the full MPEG-2 transport data stream comes out of the demodulator, and error correction units, the DTV Receiver sends it through the card plugged into the Common Interface, before it is processed by the MPEG demultiplexer in the receiver. If several CI cards are present, the MPEG transport data stream will be passed sequentially through all these cards.\n\nAn embedded CAM may not physically exist, as it may be in CPU software. In such a case, only the smart card reader normally in the CAM is fitted and not the PCMCIA type CI slots.\n\nEven if the Common Interface has been created to resolve cryptography issues, it can have other functions using other types of modules such as Web Browser, iDTV (Interactive Television), and so forth.\n\nIn Europe, DVB-CI is obligatory in all iDTV terminals.\n\nThe host sends an encrypted MPEG transport stream to the CAM and the CAM sends the decrypted transport stream back to the host. The CAM often contains a smart-card reader.\n\nThe normative DVB-CI standard EN 50221 was defined in 1997 by CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization.\n\nAccording to the Common Interface scheme:\n\nThe specification only defines two aspects, two logical interfaces to be included on the same physical interface. The first interface is the MPEG-2 Transport Stream. The link and physical layers are defined in this specification and the higher layers are defined in the MPEG-2 specifications. The second interface, the command interface, carries commands between the host (receiver) and the module.\n\nThe specification does not define the operation or functionality of a conditional access system application on the module. The applications that may be performed by a module communicating across the interface are not limited to conditional access or to those described in this specification. More than one module may be supported concurrently.\n\nThe common interface shares many features of the PC Card Standard (PCMCIA). By reducing the widths of the address\nand data buses it has been possible to include a bi-directional parallel transport stream interface.\n\nThe transport stream format is specified by IEC 13818-1 and is the MPEG 2 TS format.\n\nIn addition there is a command interface for communication between the host and module.\n\nThis communication is in the form of a layered protocol stack which allows the host and module to share resources. For example, the module can request the current date and time from the host. To use this service, module shall open a session to the \"Date-Time\" resource provided by host. Or, module can ask the host to display a message on the TV screen and can then read keypresses from the host remote control. This is done by opening a session to host's Man-Machine Interface (MMI) Resource. This resource also allows the CAM to request and receive PIN numbers.\n\nSome of defined by DVB-CI resources are de facto optional. For example, the host could contain a modem for communication over a telephone line allowing the CAM to implement pay-per-view. This can be done by opening a session to host's Low-Speed Communication (LSC) resource (assuming that the host announced the availability of this resource). The Host Control resource (allowing CAM to request force-tuned) also may be absent in some of hosts.\n\nThe definitely mandatory resources are Resource Manager, Application Information and Conditional Access Support ones. First two of these three are necessary for initial handshaking between CAM and its Host, while the CA Support resource is necessary for descrambling the selected channels.\n\nThe Command Interface is extensible and there are several specification documents available which describe these extensions (e.g. ETSI TS 101 699). However these extensions have often not proved popular with manufacturers.\n\nCI+ (also known as CI Plus or Common Interface Plus) is a specification that extends the original DVB Common Interface standard (DVB-CI, sometimes referred to as DVB-CIv1). The main addition introduced by CI+ is a form of copy protection between a CI+ conditional-access module (referenced by the spec as CICAM, while CI+ CAM seems to be a more precise abbreviation) and the television receiver (Host). CI+ is backward compatible with DVB-CIv1. Old television receivers, which have CIv1 CI-slot, can be used with CI+ CAM and vice versa, but for viewing only those of TV programs which are not marked as CI+ protected.\n\nCI+ specification has been developed by consumer electronic firms Panasonic, Philips, Samsung and Sony, as well as pay-TV technology company SmarDTV and fabless chip maker Neotion.\n\nA first draft of the specification was put up for review in January 2008 as V1.00 CI Plus Specification.\nThe establishment of the Trusted Authority has been completed and an official security certification lab appointed.\nIn 2009, versions 1.1 and 1.2 were released. The 1.2 version became the first one which was massively deployed.\nThe main features added to the original DVB-CI standard by the CI+ v1.2 are:\nThe spec doesn't state explicitly about each feature if it is mandatory or optional. The mandatory feature (as it's actually the main raison d'être of CI+) is Content Control. The optional feature of v1.2 version is \"PVR Resource\" – this can be concluded from the fact that it doesn't appear in newer CI+ spec versions.\n\nIn 2011, version 1.3 of the CI+ spec was released (later, was replaced with CI+ v1.3.1 and then with CI+ v1.3.2 , still commonly referenced as CI+ v1.3). The main features added by CI+ v1.3 to CI+ v1.2 are:\n\nWith the development of CI+, the standard has now come under the umbrella of the DVB standards organization.In 2014, DVB released ETSI TS 103 205 V1.1.1 specification, defining what is often referred as \"CI+ v1.4\".\nThe main features added by ETSI TS 103 205 to CI+ v1.3 are:\n\nIn 2018, ETSI published the second generation DVB-CI standard (often referred to as CI+ v2.0): TS 103 605 V1.1.1. The main evolution of this version is to add USB as physical layer to replace the aging PC Card interface.\n\nCI+ Host and CAM testing and certification is carried out by Eurofins Digital Testing (formerly Digital TV Labs) in the UK, Hong Kong, Belgium and Poland.\n\nBy making use of certificates issued by a trusted certification authority, a secure authenticated channel (SAC) is formed between a CI+ CAM and television receiver (Host). This SAC is used to generate a shared key, unique per a CAM-Host pair, which protects from unauthorized copying the content marked in the associated URI (Usage Rules Info) as a content which needs to be re-encrypted on its way from CAM to Host after removal the original CA or DRM scrambling (in the original CI standard, decrypted content could be sent over the PCMCIA interface only in unscrambled form).\n\nCI+ standard allows revocation of compromised CI+ Hosts. This is done by broadcasting a Service Operator Certificate Revocation List (SOCRL) in a DSM-CC data carousel. If CAM detects that its Host's ID, model or brand is listed in SOCRL (and isn't listed in optional SOCWL - Service Operator Certificate White List), the CAM must refuse descrambling the content marked in CI+ URI as protected. A SOCRL is created and signed by the CI+ Root-of-Trust on request of a Service Operator.\nTo prevent replay of out-of-dated SOCRL and SOCWL, they must be broadcast in combination with RSD (Revocation Signaling Data) table which specifies the last versions of SOCRL and SOCWL and their location in the DSM-CC data carousel. The RSD also must be signed.\n\nA CI+ compliant Host device must also implement MHEG-5 interactive TV engine to manage navigation of the user within an interactive TV application, using its device remote control. Support of MHP or HbbTV interactive TV engines is optional.\n\nThe following operators have currently rolled out CI+ support or plan to do so:\n\nIn July 2009 the largest Cable operator in the Netherlands, Ziggo, announced that it will support CI+ based Integrated Digital Television sets (IDTVs) actively. In September 2009 the first batch of 15,000 SMiT (Shenzhen State Micro Technology Co., Ltd.) CI+ CAMs was offered by various Dutch retailers, followed in October 2009 by the first batch of Neotion CAMs.\nOther supporters include Canal+, and conditional access companies Irdeto and Conax.\nIn 2009, NDS (now Cisco) announced that it will support Kabel Deutschland to deploy CI+ to its customers. In 2014, CI+ CAMs with Cisco VideoGuard CA, manufactured by SMiT were deployed at D-Smart, KDG (Kabel Deutschland), KBW, Sky Deutschland, Tele Columbus etc.\n\n\nA new ETSI working group will be working on Embedded Common Interface (ECI).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2218700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2218700", "title": "Tawang", "text": "Tawang\n\nTawang is a town in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, situated at an elevation of approximately . The town once served as the district headquarters of West Kameng district, and became the district headquarters of Tawang district when it was formed from West Kameng.\n\nThe area is part of the wider dispute between India and China concerning Arunachal Pradesh and is claimed by China as a part of the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nTawang was historically part of Tibet inhabited by the Monpa people. The Tawang Monastery was founded by the Merak Lama Lodre Gyatso in 1681 in accordance with the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama, Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso, and has an interesting legend surrounding its name, which means \"Chosen by Horse\". The sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, was born in Tawang.\n\nThe 1914 Simla Accord defined the McMahon Line as the new boundary between British India and Tibet. By this treaty Tibet relinquished several hundred square miles of its territory, including Tawang, to the British, but it was not recognised by China. According to Tsering Shakya, the British records show that the border agreed in 1914 was conditional upon China accepting the Simla Convention. Since the British were unable get China's acceptance, the Tibetans regarded the MacMahon line \"invalid\". According to Jia Liang, the British did not take possession of Tawang, which continued to be administered by Tibet. When the British botanist Frank Kingdon-Ward crossed the Sela Pass and entered Tawang in 1935 without permission from Tibet, he was briefly arrested.\nThe Tibetan government lodged a formal complaint against Britain. This drew the attention of the British, who re-examined the Indo-Tibetan border and rediscovered that Tibet had ceded Tawang to British India, and attempted to revive the McMahon Line. In November, the British government demanded that Tibet implement the 1914 Simla Accord; this met with rejection from the Tibetan government, which rejected the validity of the McMahon Line. Tibet refused to surrender Tawang, partly because of the importance attached to the Tawang Monastery. In 1938 the British made a cautious move to assert sovereignty over Tawang by sending a small military column under Capt. G.S. Lightfoot to Tawang. This expedition was met with strong resistance from the Tibetan government and local people; a serious protest was lodged against the British Indian government.\n\nLightfoot's brief visit elicited a strong diplomatic protest from Tibet but did not cause any territorial change. After the outbreak of the war between China and Japan in 1941, the government of Assam undertook a number of 'forward policy' measures to tighten their hold on the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) area, which later became Arunachal Pradesh. In 1944 administrative control was extended over the area of the Tawang tract lying South of the Sela Pass when J.P. Mills set up an Assam Rifles post at Dirang Dzong and sent the Tibetan tax-collectors packing. Tibetan protests were brushed aside. However, no steps were taken to evict Tibet from the area north of the pass which contained Tawang town.\n\nThe situation continued after India's independence but underwent a decisive change in 1950 when Tibet lost its autonomy and was incorporated into the newly established People's Republic of China. In February 1951, Major Ralengnao 'Bob' Khathing led an Assam Rifles column to Tawang town and took control of the remainder of the Tawang tract from the Tibetans, removing the Tibetan administration. During the Sino-Indian war of 1962, Tawang fell briefly under Chinese control, but China voluntarily withdrew its troops at the end of the war. Tawang again came under Indian administration, but China has not relinquished its claims on most of Arunachal Pradesh including Tawang.\n\nThe MLA (August 2016) of Tawang constituency is Tsering Tashi.\n\nTawang town is located approximately from Guwahati and from Tezpur. Tawang has an average elevation of .\n\nThe climate is warm and temperate in Tawang. In winter, there is much less rainfall in Tawang than in summer. According to Köppen and Geiger, this climate is classified as Cwb. The average temperature in Tawang is 10.3 °C. The average annual rainfall is .\nAs of the 2011 census, Tawang had a population of 11,202.\n\nTawang Monastery was founded by the Mera Lama Lodre Gyatso in accordance to the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama, Nagwang Lobsang Gyatso. It belongs to the Gelugpa sect and is the largest Buddhist monastery in India. The name Tawang () means \"Horse Chosen\". It is said to be the biggest Buddhist monastery in the world outside of Lhasa, Tibet. It is a major holy site for Tibetan Buddhists as it was the birthplace of the sixth Dalai Lama.\n\nWhen the 14th Dalai Lama fled from Tibet to escape from the Chinese army, he crossed into India on 30 March 1959 and spent some days at the Tawang Monastery before reaching Tezpur in Assam on 18 April. Prior to 1959, the Dalai Lama refused to recognize India's sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh, including Tawang. In 2003, the Dalai Lama said that \"Arunachal Pradesh was actually part of Tibet\". In January 2007, he said that in 1914, both the Tibetan government and Britain recognized the McMahon Line. In 2008, he said that \"Arunchal Pradesh was a part of India under the agreement signed by Tibetan and British representatives\". The Dalai Lama visited Tawang on 8 November 2009. About 30,000 people, including those from neighbouring Nepal and Bhutan, attended his religious discourse.\n\nTawang Air Force Station has an already functional heliport and fixed-wing \"\"Advanced Landing Ground\"\" (AGL) capable of handling Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft. The Indian Airforce (IAF) has offered the upgraded ALG in Tawang for the operation of civil helicopter and flights for the tourism and UDAN scheme.\n\nThe nearest functional civil airports with scheduled flights are the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport at Guwahati and Salonibari Airport at Tezpur located at a distance of 450 and 325 kilometers, respectively.\n\nThe nearest railway station is at Naharlagun, which is connected to major cities. A broad-gauge railway line connecting Missamari in Assam with Tawang has been proposed and a survey for the line was sanctioned in 2011.\n\nThe proposed 166 km long rail link from the existing Bhalukpong railway station to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh being undertaken as the national project will boost tourism and enhance the national security with faster movement of troops, it will pass through elevations of over 10,000 feet, the 80% of the tracks will be through tunnels and the longest tunnel will be 29.48 km long. This link will reduce the existing 285 km Bhalukpong-Tawang road distance by 119 km, and to shorten the road distance as well the railway will also develop 2 lane road highway along the rail line. Once completed, further extionsion plans include a 100 km long western spur to Yongphulla Airport (upgraded by India and jointly used by the Indian Army and Bhutan Army) in eastern Bhutan via Yabab in India and Trashigang in Bhutan.\n\nBy road, Tawang is from capital Itanagar and is connected with buses run by APSRTC and private services. \n\nSela Tunnel through Sela Pass is an under-construction road tunnel project to ensure all-weather connectivity between Guwahati in Assam and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh state of India. The tunnel gets its name from 4170 m (13,700 ft) Sela Pass which this tunnel will cut across and reduce the distance between Dirang and Tawang by 10 km. The Government of India announced the funding for construction of all weather transport tunnel in 2018-19 budget. Construction will start in Jan/Feb 2019 and end by Jan/Feb 2022. The tunnel which is being constructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will cut the travel time from the Indian Army's IV Corps headquarter at Tezpur to Tawang by at least 10 km or 1 hour, and it will also help make the NH13 an all-weather road to access Tawang which usually gets disconnected during winter. Pass itself is located at 13,700 feet, but the tunnel will pass through at the height of 10,000 feet. BRO is also improving the road from Sangestar Tso (north of Tawang) to Bum La Pass on India-China Line of Actual Control (disputed parts of McMahon Line). The tenders for construction were floated in 2018, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone in Feb 2019 to commence the construction.\n\nPlanned Arunachal Frontier Highway will also pass through here.\n\nTawang receives snowfall every year during December–January. There is also a ski lift in town.
