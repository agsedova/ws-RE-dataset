The line was soon to be taken over by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). In 1912, a branch line to was opened , with an intermediate station at . 70 years later, Watford Stadium station was created to serve Vicarage Road football ground for crowd control. Prior to this, the nearest stations available to football fans were Watford High Street and Watford Junction. A direct transport connection from the stadium would enable football officials to keep fans of \"away\" teams separate from Watford F.C. supporters and reduce instances of football hooliganism in Watford town centre. The station acquired the nickname of \"Hooligan Halt\".\n\nDevelopment of the station was funded jointly by the Football Trust, which contributed £50,000, Watford Borough Council (£80,000), Watford F.C. (£50,000), with the remaining £200,000 paid by British Rail. It was officially opened on 4 December 1982 by the rock musician and chairman of Watford Football Club, Elton John, and chairman of the Football Trust, Lord Aberdare. The inaugural train rolled into the station five minutes late. The station was only open on match days, with the first crowds passing through the station being Manchester United fans on the opening day.\n\nThe Croxley Green branch was temporarily closed in 1996 when a local road construction scheme severed the line and it was formally closed in 2003. However, Watford Stadium Halt had not been used for some years prior to this, although it is not known exactly when the halt was last used. The halt was not demolished and the station furniture, including the lampposts and signage, was left in situ. Despite nature reclaiming the station, the platforms and station furniture (apart from the station nameboards) were still in place when clearance work in preparation for the Croxley Rail Link began. This was a proposal to extend the London Underground Metropolitan line to . The project would have involve re-opening part of the Watford and Rickmansworth line and running the Metropolitan line along this line, and the construction of two new stations.

It was built for Upper Canada Chief Justice Sir William Campbell and his wife Hannah. The home was designed for entertaining and comfort, and constructed at a time when the Campbells were socially and economically established and their children had grown to adulthood. The house is one of the few remaining examples of Georgian architecture left in Toronto and is constructed in a style in vogue during the late Georgian era known as Palladian architecture.\n\nThe house was originally located on a plot of land southeast of its current location, at the intersection of what is now Adelaide Street (then 64 Duke Street) and Frederick Street. More specifically, it stood at the head of Frederick Street as a view terminus, on the site presently occupied by George Brown College's Chef School or Centre for Hospitality at 300 Adelaide Street East. Upon Sir William Campbell's death in 1834, his estate conveyed the house to his wife, Lady Campbell, for her use. After Lady Campbell's death in 1844, her estate auctioned the property and the contents of the house with the proceeds distributed amongst their heirs. For most of the 19th century the structure remained a private residence. It was home to various prominent citizens (Hon. James Gordon, Terence O’Neil, John Strathy and John Fensom) until 1890, by which point the neighbourhood had changed into a commercial and industrial zone. The building eventually came to be used by several businesses after the turn of the 20th century as office space and a factory, including Hobbs Glass Company; Capewell Horse Nail Company and Masco Elevator Company.\n\nIn 1972, the last owners of the property, the Coutts-Hallmark Greeting Cards Company, wanted to demolish the house to expand its parking lot. Prior to demolition the company offered the house to anyone who could remove it from the property. A professional association of trial lawyers known as the Advocates Society, launched a campaign to save the building. They eventually secured the site at the northwest corner of University Avenue and Queen Street West, south of the Canada Life Building (formerly site of three buildings at the corner including United Clothing Store). With assistance from maintenance trucks of the Toronto Transit Commission, the home was moved northwest from Adelaide Street to the north side of Queen Street West, between University Avenue and Simcoe Street on March 30, 1972. The move was a major spectacle, and attracted a large crowd as it closed several downtown streets. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother opened the fully restored structure on June 28, 1974.\n\nThe preservation of the house was an important turning point in architectural preservation in Toronto. During the 1950s and 1960s, 19th-century homes were demolished at a rapid rate; architect Eric Arthur even predicted that by the year 2000, there may be no 19th-century buildings left in the city. The spectacle of the physical move to save Campbell House was a preservation achievement which sparked greater interest among Torontonians to save other local landmarks when they became threatened.\n\nThe home is owned by the City of Toronto government. It serves as both a historic house museum and a club for the members of the Advocates Society. The museum also includes an art gallery. The home has also displayed outdoor exhibitions, including the 2013 show by Canadian contemporary artist Harley Valentine, titled Barbarians at the Gate.\n\n\n"}

In the serial, Monarch plots to invade Earth for its minerals using a deadly toxin to wipe out humanity so he can continue to make improvements to his ship.\n\nThe TARDIS materialises on board a vast and advanced alien spacecraft, observed by a hovering surveillance device which conveys the arrival of the crew to an observing being in control of the vessel. The TARDIS crew become separated and the Fifth Doctor and Tegan reach the bridge where the green-skinned commander introduces himself as Monarch, ruler of Urbanka, and his associates and fellow Urbankans are the Ministers of Enlightenment and Persuasion. The leader is intrigued by talk of current Earth civilisation and reveals their ship is bound for Earth. Shortly afterwards Enlightenment and Persuasion assume human forms, dressed in garments Tegan designed to demonstrate contemporary Earth fashions.\n\nThe TARDIS crew are reunited as guests, and it soon becomes apparent that there are four distinct human cultures represented on the vessel by a small group of humans – Ancient Greeks, the leader of whom is the philosopher Bigon; Chinese Mandarins and their leader Lin Futu; Princess Villagra and representatives of the Maya peoples; and Kurkutji and his tribesmen, of a very ancient Australian Aboriginal culture. The Urbankans have made periodic visits to Earth, each time getting speedier in their journeys. This time they have left their homeworld after erratic solar activity, storing three billion of their species on slides aboard their craft. It seems that the current journey is their last and that they now wish to settle on Earth, which they are due to reach in four days.\n\nThe Doctor becomes suspicious of Monarch and soon learns that the Urbankan does not plan on peaceful co-existence. Instead, he has developed a toxin to wipe out humanity, which will be unleashed before the Urbankans disembark. He also learns that the humans aboard are not descendants of the original abductees, but are the original people taken from Earth and converted into androids, like the three Urbankans walking around on board (Monarch's actual status, whether partly cybernetic or completely organic, is not stated explicitly). Monarch describes the era prior to his conversion of Urbankan life forms into cyborgs as the \"flesh-time\". The four leaders of the peoples have been given additional circuits to help them reason, but this facility can be taken away, as Bigon learns when he rebels against Monarch, and his neural circuit is removed and placed in a container for one hundred years. He explained to the Doctor that Monarch strip-mined and destroyed Urbanka in a quest for minerals to improve the ship, and now plans to do the same to Earth. Monarch believes that if he can move the ship faster than the speed of light, he can pilot it back to the beginning of time and discover himself as God.\n\nAdric, nevertheless, is rather taken with Monarch, and tensions between him and the Doctor become very strained. It takes the truth to break the alien's hold over the boy. The Doctor now sets about overthrowing Monarch and, with the help of the human androids led by a restored Bigon, a revolution is put into effect. Enlightenment and Persuasion are decircuited, while Monarch himself (whom the Doctor realises is still organic as there is an oxygen-producing flora chamber on the ship) is exposed to the deadly toxin and killed. The humanoid androids decide to pilot the vessel to a new home on a new world, while the TARDIS crew departs. Back in the console room, Nyssa suddenly collapses to the floor in a dead faint.\n\nThe working title for this story was \"Days Of Wrath\". Although \"Castrovalva\" was the first story aired which featured Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor, this story was the first in the season to be produced.\n\nIt was originally decided that after \"Castrovalva\", the Doctor would only have two companions, Adric and Tegan. As a result, the character of Nyssa was to be written out of the series at the end of this story. However, Peter Davison strongly opposed this move because he felt that Nyssa was the companion who was \"most suited to his vision of the Doctor\". Given this, producer John Nathan-Turner and the rest of the production team relented and Nyssa was retained. The story for the following serial \"Kinda\" was already developed with two companions and Nyssa was not featured in that narrative as written. Rather than a complete rewrite of \"Kinda\" to include Nyssa in the narrative, she remains absent much of that serial, said to be resting in the TARDIS. This was set up with Nyssa's collapse at the end of this story.\n\nKwouk later played Doctor Hayashi in the audio play \"Loups-Garoux\" while Paul Shelley appeared in \"The Whispering Forest\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in April 1983.\n\n\"Four to Doomsday\" was released on VHS in September 2001. A DVD of the story was released on 15 September 2008. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 105 on 9 January 2013.\n"}

Following a six-figure bidding war between rival record labels, the band signed a deal with Polydor Records. In December 1989, the British music magazine \"NME\" picked Power of Dreams, along with others such as Carter USM and The Charlatans, as their \"stars of tomorrow\".\n\nTheir first album, \"Immigrants, Emigrants and Me\", was released in 1990, receiving glowing reviews worldwide. The album was produced by Ray Shulman and sold well in France, Japan, the UK and Ireland. The band then embarked on a world tour as a supporting act for The Mission, taking in more than 30 countries, including Japan and North America. The follow-up album, \"2 Hell With Common Sense\", was released two years later, produced by Dave Meegan and with a more powerful sound, helped by an additional guitarist, Ian Olney (ex-Cypress, Mine!).\n\nLater albums were less successful in the UK and Ireland but the band retained a following, and their major label contract. in Japan. The third album, \"Positivity\", was released on Lemon Records in 1993, and further developed the sound introduced on their previous record. Power of Dreams released a last album, \"Become Yourself\", the following year. In 1995, the band backed and recorded with the musician Soichi Taniguchi in Japan before disbanding.\n\nFollowing the split, Walker and Olney formed Pharmacy with Chris Pierce, and Morty McCarthy from The Sultans of Ping FC. Pharmacy released one single called \"Shine\" in 1998. Subsequently, Walker recorded three albums with Archive before releasing his first solo album, \"Siamese\", in 2009. Olney formed and performed in a number of bands including Temperance Union, Miracle Retreat, Deer Park and Red Atlas, and has been playing bass guitar for Sultans of Ping since 2005.

Power of Dreams' most recent gig was as part of \"Indie Daze\" at London's Forum in September 2014.\n\nIn March 2011, Walker announced an amicable departure from the band and has gone on to play with Sister Cities, Being Cool Is Lonely and The Holy Coast. Olney plays with a new band, Cat Meat. Walker has continued to perform as Power of Dreams and to work on new material alongside his new project, Mineral, based in Paris. In 2014, The Avener had a chart-topping hit single in several European countries with \"Fade Out Lines\", a remix of a song written by Walker and Phoebe Killdeer (ex-Nouvelle Vague) for Phoebe Killdeer and the Short Straws' second album \"Innerquake\", released in 2012.\n\nIn December 2011, \"Immigrants, Emigrants and Me\" appeared in the book \"101 Irish Records You Must Hear Before You Die\".

During Hara's own lifetime, the place became an aggregation point for Meiji period artists. World War II caused great damage to the buildings. In 1953 the garden was donated by the Hara family to the City of Yokohama, which created the Sankeien Hoshōkai Foundation for its repair and maintenance. The Foundation started the restoration in 1953 and, five years later, the garden was back almost to its original form and reopened to the public.\n\nThe Japanese government has designated ten structures in Sankei-en as Important Cultural Properties, while three more are Tangible Cultural Properties designated by the City of Yokohama.

A Gifu Prefecture native, Hara was the eldest son of Yanaizuchō village's headman. From childhood he liked and studied the fine arts, Sinology and poetry, finally beginning formal studies in 1885 in what is now Tokyo's Waseda University. After graduation, he became a teacher at the Atomi School for Girls. Born Aoki, he changed it later after marrying one of his students and being adopted by her family. He became the head of the family trading business and was very successful. After moving to Sankei-en's present location in Honmoku, he started collecting old buildings, rebuilding them in his garden. He then decided to open the garden to the public for free in 1906.\n\nThe Outer Garden, that is, the area next to the Main Pond, was the first part of the garden to open to the public in 1906.

His music has been variously described as \"remorselessly harsh\", a \"beautifully crafted amalgam of several 20th-century styles\", and \"neo-romantic\". Sallinen studied at the Sibelius Academy, where his teachers included Joonas Kokkonen. He has had works commissioned by the Kronos Quartet, and has also written seven operas, eight symphonies, concertos for violin, cello, flute, horn, and English horn, as well as several chamber works. He won the Nordic Council Music Prize in 1978 for his opera \"Ratsumies\" (\"The Horseman\").\n\nSallinen was born in Salmi. During his childhood the family moved several times for his father's work, and during Evacuation of Finnish Karelia in 1944 the family relocated to Uusikaupunki, where Aulis Sallinen attended his schools.\n\nHis first instruments were violin and piano. He would play both jazz and classical music. He was known to be extremely creative and spent much time during his teenage years improvising. After a while, he began writing his ideas down on paper and began serious composition. He attended the Sibelius Academy of Music and studied with a number of prestigious teachers such as Aarre Merikanto and Joonas Kokkonen.\n\nAfter graduating, Sallinen took a position as composition teacher at the Sibelius Academy and continued composing. Among his pupils were i.e. the Austrian born Finnish composer Herman Rechberger and Jouni Kaipainen. He was appointed as the general manager of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1960 and held the position until 1969. He was the chairman of the board of the Society of Finnish Composers between 1971–74. Though he was a known teacher and was on many boards of directors, his compositions were not particularly noted until he was made \"Artist Professor\" by the Finnish government in 1976, letting him concentrate on composing.\n\nSallinen's first opera Ratsumies (The Horseman) premiered at the Savonlinna Opera Festival in 1975. Together with Joonas Kokkonen's The Last Temptations (1975) it started a golden era of modern Finnish opera. His second opera, Punainen viiva (The Red Line), was commissioned by the Finnish National Opera. Sallinen's next opera, Kuningas lähtee Ranskaan (The King Goes Forth to France), was a joint commission by Covent Garden and the Finnish National Opera.\n\nAfter receiving his lifelong art professorship, Sallinen devoted great amounts of time to composing. He has revived standard forms and harmonies, but he puts them together in contemporary ways. He has received a number of commissions from renowned ensembles and has composed eight symphonies, including one using material from a proposed ballet based on \"The Lord of the Rings\" and containing two mediaeval Finnish tunes from the \"Piae Cantiones\". He has written seven operas and is well known as the composer of the title track of the Kronos Quartet's album \"Winter Was Hard\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The station, which is owned by Network Rail (NR) and managed by Abellio ScotRail, is on the Highland Main Line between Perth and Inverness, and is also the southern terminus of the Strathspey preserved railway.\n\nThe line was opened by the Inverness and Perth Junction Railway (I&PJR) in 1863, subsequently becoming part of the Highland Railway.\n\nThe current station was opened in 1898, to designs by the architect William Roberts when the \"direct\" line to Inverness via Slochd was built, making Aviemore an important junction and replacing the original 1863 building. William Roberts also provided an engine shed to the north of the station in 1896.\n\nIt became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway after the Grouping of 1923, then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.\n\nThe original I&PJR line to fell victim to the Beeching Axe, closing to passengers in October 1965.\n\nWhen Sectorisation was introduced by British Rail in the 1980s, the station was served by Scotrail until the Privatisation of British Rail.\n\nIn 1998 the station was restored and refurbished, and the Strathspey Railway was finally allowed to use the island platform. The island platform's three buildings were restored and brought back into use, having been derelict for many years, and a fourth was built from scratch. The new building comprises a ticket hall, booking office and shop, and the three original buildings are waiting rooms (with historical displays), staff offices, and toilets. Parking, reached from the Rothiemurchus road in the south of the town, is on the station's east side, and passenger access to the Strathspey part of the station is via a foot-crossing across the junction spur. This foot crossing also provides disabled access to platform 2. This is the second biggest railway station in Highland (Council area), after Inverness.\n\nFollowing the moving of services, the Strathspey Railway closed their Aviemore (Speyside) railway station. The platform remains, as fears over asbestos contamination have stalled its removal. The original footbridge also still stands but is unsafe.\n\nRoad access to the NR station building is from Grampian Road, to the west of the line. A canopied island platform, connected to the station building by a footbridge, lies beyond the two main-line tracks, and the further (eastern) platform face of this island is used by Strathspey trains. The junction between the Strathspey Railway and Network Rail lies to the south of the station and is controlled from the station signal box, which also controls a large portion of the main line either side of here (from all the way to Culloden Moor since 1979) as well as the immediate station area.\n\nThe station is from , and has a passing loop long, flanked by two platforms. Platform 1 on the down (northbound) line can accommodate trains having fourteen coaches, whereas platform 2 on the up (southbound) line can hold fifteen.\n\nServices are provided by Abellio ScotRail, Caledonian Sleeper, and London North Eastern Railway on the Highland Main Line and Strathspey Railway on the former Inverness and Perth Junction Railway to Boat of Garten and Broomhill.\n\nIn the May 2016 timetable, there are seven trains each weekday to Edinburgh Waverley (including the \"Highland Chieftain\" to ) and four to southbound, plus the overnight sleeper to London Euston (the latter does not run southbound on Saturday nights & northbound on Sundays). Northbound there are twelve departures to Inverness.\n\nOn Sundays there are five trains to Edinburgh (including the King's Cross service) and two to Glasgow, along with seven to Inverness.\n\nFrom 2018, this station will be one of those to benefit from a package of timetable enhancements introduced by Transport Scotland and Scotrail. The current Perth to Inverness timetable will increase to hourly each way, with trains south of there running on alternate hours to Edinburgh & Glasgow. Journey times will also be reduced by 10 minutes to both cities.\n\n\n"}

Current research indicates that genetic factors are suspected in the cause of autism as well as environmental factors.\n\nThe terms refrigerator mother and refrigerator parents were coined around 1950 as a label for mothers of children diagnosed with autism or schizophrenia. When Leo Kanner first identified autism in 1943, he noted the lack of warmth among the parents of autistic children. Parents, particularly mothers, were often blamed for their children's atypical behavior, which included rigid rituals, speech difficulty, and self-isolation. \n\nIn his 1943 paper that first identified autism, Leo Kanner called attention to what appeared to him as a lack of warmth among the fathers and mothers of autistic children. In a 1949 paper, Kanner suggested autism may be related to a \"genuine lack of maternal warmth\", noted that fathers rarely stepped down to indulge in children's play, and observed that children were exposed from \"the beginning to parental coldness, obsessiveness, and a mechanical type of attention to material needs only... They were left neatly in refrigerators which did not defrost. Their withdrawal seems to be an act of turning away from such a situation to seek comfort in solitude.\" In a 1960 interview, Kanner bluntly described parents of autistic children as \"just happening to defrost enough to produce a child.\"\nIn Kanner's original paper, however, only one set of parents were described as \"cold\", with many family members appearing to be from one neurological minority or another upon close reading of the text.\n\nBruno Bettelheim at the University of Chicago was instrumental in facilitating its widespread acceptance both by the public and the medical establishment. Bettelheim was hired in 1944 to be the director of the Orthogenic School for Troubled Children at the University of Chicago as a residential treatment milieu for such children, who he felt would benefit from a \"parentectomy\". This marked the apex of autism viewed as a disorder of parenting. \n\nBettelheim later expounded his theories about autism in his 1967 book \"Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self\". In it, he compared autism to being a prisoner in a concentration camp:\n\nThe difference between the plight of prisoners in a concentration camp and the conditions which lead to autism and schizophrenia in children is, of course, that the child has never had a previous chance to develop much of a personality.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, in the absence of any biomedical explanation of autism's cause after the telltale symptoms were first described by scientists, Bettelheim as well as some psychoanalysts championed the notion that autism was the product of mothers who were cold, distant and rejecting, thus depriving their children of the chance to \"bond properly\". \n\nThe theory was embraced by the medical establishment and went largely unchallenged into the mid-1960s, but its effects have lingered into the 21st century. Many articles and books published in that era blamed autism on a maternal lack of affection, but by 1964, Bernard Rimland, a psychologist who had an autistic son, published a book that signaled the emergence of a counter-explanation to the established misconceptions about the causes of autism. His book, \"Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior\", attacked the refrigerator mother hypothesis directly.\n\nIn 1969, Kanner addressed the refrigerator mother issue at the first annual meeting of what is now the Autism Society of America, stating:\n\nFrom the very first publication until the last, I spoke of this condition in no uncertain terms as \"innate.\" But because I described some of the characteristics of the parents as persons, I was misquoted often as having said that \"it is all the parents' fault.\"\n\nAccording to the book \"In a Different Key: The Story of Autism\" (2016), Leo Kanner's original 1943 paper stated that \"the child's aloneness\" was evident \"from the very beginning of life.\" Furthermore, he drew a contrast between autism and schizophrenia, in that autism was part of a child's constitution whereas schizophrenia developed later in life.\n\nThis first paper drew only a handful of citations in the medical literature. The condition he described was not talked about by a single newspaper or magazine article. In addition, clinicians in other parts of the world were not confirming what Kanner had seen, so through approximately 1950, virtually all cases of autism were diagnosed by Kanner himself.\n\nKanner engaged in lengthy conversation by mail with Louise Despert, who was a New York psychiatrist he held in high esteem. Kanner defended his theories whereas Despert maintained that he had not observed anything other than child schizophrenia. When Kanner next revised his textbook, he moved autism to the schizophrenia category although he placed it in a subheading.\n\nIn a 2016 paper entitled \"Correcting the Record: Leo Kanner and Autism,\" Drs. James Harris and Joseph Piven maintain that Kanner did not go through a middle period in which he blamed parents. Instead, Kanner was describing characteristics of the parents which would later be viewed as part of the broader autism phenotype. For example, in a 1956 paper Kanner and a co-author wrote, \"If one considers the personalities of the parents who have been described as successfully autistic, the possibility suggests itself that they may represent milder manifestations and that the children show the full emergence of the latent structure.\" In addition, the early 1940s was still a period when eugenics was held in respect, and in the United States, sterilization of people with intellectual disability was legal. Furthermore, this was a period in which psychoanalysis with its emphasis on early life experiences was the dominant view among the clinical and scientific establishment. In addition, if autism was in fact caused by negative parenting, that would seem to offer more hope for treatment of the child and/or family.\n\nIn 1949 Kanner published his third major paper on autism. According to \"In a Different Key\", he began to blame cold mothering. Whereas previously he had positive things to say about Donald Triplett's mother Mary, now he painted a picture in which Mary appeared \"cold.\" And he portrayed parents in general as being at least partially to blame for the autistic characteristics of their children.\n\nBlaming parents, and in particular blaming mothers, seemed to resonate with broader society. For example, after Kanner blamed mothers, \"Time\" magazine wanted to write about autism. Kanner viewed 1951 as a turning point for the wider understanding of autism. Within ten years, some fifty-two articles and one book had been published by a variety of thinkers and clinicians. And autism began to be diagnosed overseas, first in Holland and then elsewhere.\n\nIn the hardcover version of \"In a Different Key\" (2016), authors John Donvan and Caren Zucker state \"Kanner, instead of sticking by his initial conviction about autism being inborn, had flinched.\" The authors further state that \"the refrigerator-mother myth was set loose upon the world for many years to come.\"\n\nIn a 1969 speech at a U.S. convention for parents with children on the autism spectrum, Kanner said, \"Herewith, I officially acquit you people as parents.\" However, in the 1979 edition of his textbook \"Child Psychiatry\", he states that childhood schizophrenia (a phrase often used for autism until the 1970s) was more closed correlated with parental attitudes than with a person's genetic background.\n\nFor Silvano Arieti, who wrote his major works from the 1950s through the 70s, the terms \"autistic thought\" and what he called \"paleologic thought\" are apparently the same phenomenon. Paleologic thought is a characteristic in both present-day schizophrenics and primitive men, a type of thinking that has its foundations in non-Aristotelian logic. An autistic child speaks of himself as \"you\" and not infrequently of the mother as \"I\". The \"you\" remains a \"you\" and is not transformed into \"I\".\n\nFor Margaret Mahler and her colleagues, autism is a defense of children who cannot experience the mother as the living primary-object. According to them, autism is an attempt at dedifferentiation and deanimation. The symbiotic autistic syndrome used to be called the \"Mahler syndrome\" because Mahler first described it: The child is unable to differentiate from the mother.\n\nArieti warned that an autistic tendency is a sign of a kind of disorder in the process of socialization, and that when autistic expressions appear it should be assumed that there is a sort of difficulty between the child and his parents, especially the schizogenic mother. Children who use autistic expressions, Arieti observes, are children who cannot bond socially.\n\nIn \"Interpretation of Schizophrenia\" (1955) Arieti maintained that for a normal process of socialization, it is necessary for the parent-child relations to be normal. Loving or non-anxiety parental attitudes favor socialization. Arieti not only maintained that the parent-child relations are the first social act and the major drive of socialization, but also a stimulus to either accept or reject society. The child's self in this view is a reflection of the sentiments, thoughts, and attitudes of the parents toward the child. Autistic children show an extreme socializing disorder and do not want any sort of relationship with people. They \"eliminate\" people from their consciousness. For Arieti the fear of the parents is extended to other adults: a tendency to cut off communication with human beings.\n\nAccording to Peter Breggin's 1991 book \"Toxic Psychiatry\", the psychogenic theory of autism was abandoned because of political pressure from parents' organizations, not for scientific reasons. For example, some case reports have shown that profound institutional privation can result in quasi-autistic symptoms. Clinician Frances Tustin devoted her life to the theory. She wrote:\n\nOne must note that autism is one of a number of children's neurological disorders of psychogenic nature, i.e., caused by abusive and traumatic treatment of infants. ...There is persistent denial by American society of the causes of damage to millions of children who are thus traumatized and brain damaged as a consequence of cruel treatment by parents who are otherwise too busy to love and care for their babies.\n\nAlice Miller, one of the best-known authors of the consequences of child abuse, has maintained that autism is psychogenic, and that fear of the truth about child abuse is the leitmotif of nearly all forms of autistic therapy known to her. When Miller visited several autism therapy centers in the United States, it became apparent to her that the stories of children \"inspired fear in both doctors and mothers alike\":\n\nI spent a day observing what happened to the group. I also studied close-ups of children on video. What became clearer and clearer as the day went on was that all these children had a serious history of suffering behind them. This, however, was never referred to...In my conversations with the therapists and mothers, I inquired about the life stories of individual children. The facts confirmed my hunch. No one, however, was willing to take these facts seriously.\n\nLike Arieti and Tustin, Miller believes that only empathetic parental attitudes lead to the complete blossoming of the child's personality.\n\nThe refrigerator mother theory, widely discarded in the United States, still has some support in France and Europe and is largely believed in South Korea to be the cause of autism. The academic psychologist Tony Humphreys of University College Cork is a leading Irish proponent of the theory of frigid parenting, despite censure by the Psychological Society of Ireland.\n\nThe modern consensus is that autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and are not well understood. Moreover, fetal and infant exposure to pesticides, viruses, and household chemicals have also been implicated as triggering the syndrome.\n\nAlthough recent studies have indicated that parental warmth, praise, and quality of relationship are associated with reductions of behavior problems in autistic adolescents and adults, and that parental criticisms are associated with maladaptive behaviors and symptoms, these ideas are distinct from the refrigerator mother hypothesis.\n\nWhen they are infants and toddlers, children on the autism spectrum do not on average differ in attachment behavior from other infants and toddlers. For the subset of autistic infants who display \"disorganized attachment,\" this may be more readily explained by intellectual disability than by the behavior of the parents.\n\nIn 2002, Kartemquin Films released \"Refrigerator Mothers\", a documentary that takes a look at American mothers of the 1950s and 1960s and the blame leveled by the medical establishment for the mothers causing their children's autism. The premiere was broadcast in the summer of 2002 by United States' PBS, which the PBS website has described as \"Though wholly discredited today, the 'refrigerator mother' diagnosis condemned thousands of autistic children to questionable therapies, and their mothers to a long nightmare of self-doubt and guilt. In \"Refrigerator Mothers\", the new film by David E. Simpson, J. J. Hanley and Gordon Quinn, and a Kartemquin Educational Films production, these mothers tell their story for the first time.\"\n\n\n"}

Most fellows of the society are Americans, but among them have always been a significant number of fellows from around the world. The society encourages activities that expands geographical knowledge, and the interpretation of that knowledge so that it can be useful to geographers and other disciplines, especially in a policymaking environment. It is the oldest nationwide geographical organization in the United States. Over the century and a half of its existence, the AGS has been especially interested in three regions: the Arctic, the Antarctic, and Latin America. A signature characteristic of the AGS-sponsored exploration was the requirement that its expeditions produce tangible scientific results.\n\nThe AGS was founded by 31 New Yorkers, who were wealthy philanthropists, historians, publishers and editors. Among them were George Folsom, Henry Grinnell, Henry Varnum Poor, Hiram Barney, Alexander Isaac Cotheal, Henry Evelyn Pierrepont, S. De Witt Bloodgood, John Romeyn Brodhead, Joshua Leavitt and Archibald Russell.\n\nThe founders held a joint interest in polar exploration, and readily organized the AGS upon the request of Lady Franklin to search for her husband and his voyagers lost in the Polar Franklin Expedition. In September 1851, the committee formed to draft a constitution. On October 9, this committee undertook the constitution at a meeting held in the Geographical and Statistical Library in New York City. The society was not fully established until December 7, 1854, under a charter granted by legislator of the State of New York'\n\nThe society was primarily named the \"American Geographical and Statistical Society\"; possibly due to the fact that the organizational meeting was held in New York University's \"Geographical and Statistical Library\". In 1871, the AGS amended its Charter and dropped \"and Statistical\" from its title, thus becoming the \"American Geographical Society\".\n\nThe society's first and most ambitious attempt to influence governmental policy was made early in 1862. On January 7, a special committee was appointed to devise a taxation system to correspond with the present state of public affairs. The committee prepared a report which was printed and distributed to members of the society, members of Congress, and other public functionaries throughout the United States. The society also began to integrate globally within the international geographical community, sending a council member to attend the first International Geographical Congress.\nDuring World War I, the interdisciplinary, government-sponsored \"Inquiry\" in preparation for the Paris Peace Conference was led by the AGS and headquartered in the society's building in New York. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, President Woodrow Wilson and the American Delegation sailed for France. With them sailed AGS Director Isaiah Bowman and three truckloads of geographical information compiled by Bowman and 150 geographers, historians, economists, statisticians, ethnographers, political scientists, and scholars of international law.\n\nThe AGS was instrumental in providing technical and professional support to the many polar expeditions of Louise Arner Boyd during the 1930s. Her long-time friendship with geographer and photographer, Isaiah Bowman, helped inspire in Louise a lifelong interest in geography and photography, which proved invaluable on all her expeditions. The AGS published her book, \"The Fiord Region of East Greenland\", and also sent her in 1934 as the organization's delegate to the International Geographical Congress in Warsaw, Poland. During this trip Louise traveled throughout Poland with local experts, documenting the life, work and customs of the rural people, a population that would undergo drastic changes during and after the Second World War. The AGS published her second book, \"Rural Poland\".\n\nAfter World War I, the society undertook an ambitious effort to map \"Hispanic America\" as part of the international effort to map the entire world at 1:1,000,000. The venture lasted from 1920 to 1945 and eventually produced 107 map sheets at a total cost of more than one-half million dollars, mostly in private donations.\n\nDuring World War II, the society assisted more than forty agencies of the U.S. government. Contributing ethnographic data to U.S. Military Intelligence in the efforts to defuse Axis strongholds in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe headquarters of the American Geographical Society were initially established at New York University in Washington Square. The University's chapel was used for some of the society's lectures and the AGS remained at this location until 1858. Later, two rooms located in Clinton Hall, formerly the Astor Opera House, became the society's next home in December 1858. In 1866, the American Geographical Society moved to Cooper Union at Cooper Square on Ninth Street, where it remained for ten years. In 1911, the AGS moved to 3755 Broadway at 156th Street. This three story building was built on land donated by Archer Milton Huntington's mother and designed by Charles Pratt Huntington. Audubon Terrace became the society's most prominent home and was visited by many scholars and dignitaries, including President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nAfter numerous relocations across New York City, the AGS is currently housed at 32 Court Street, Brooklyn.\n\nThe AGS was awarded the Scottish Geographical Medal by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 2001.\n\nThe society has possessed a diverse line of presidents, including a New York City Mayor and The New York Times Editor. The first president was George Bancroft, an American historian and statesman who was prominent in the promotion of secondary education and public policy.\n\nThe society's presidents have included:\n\nOther leaders\n\nThe AGS publishes a peer-reviewed, scholarly periodical devoted exclusively to geography titled \"Geographical Review\"\n. The journal contains articles on all aspects of current topical and regional issues within geography. Additionally, the society publishes a forty-page, full-color journal titled \"Focus' in Geography\", which includes articles on a variety of topics aimed towards a broader audience of students, teachers, administrators and parents. \"Focus\" is edited and written by academic and professional geographers and includes theme sections; maps and photos; and special country issues.\n\"Ubique\", the society's thrice-yearly letter newsletter, serves as a vehicle for communication of Society news and events. Ubique is sent to all Fellows, Associates, Medalists, Geography Department Heads, and Galileo Circle Members.\n\nThe AGS also provides geographers to speak to the media on a variety of issues critical to human, environmental, political, and economic development. The AGS Writers Circle produces Commentary and Op Ed pieces about issues of importance to global society, such as geopolitics, spatial technologies (e.g. Geographic Information Sciences (GIS) and Spatial Modeling), water management, global climate change, globalization, urban growth and change, and social issues.\n\nTo contribute to geographical understanding, the AGS arranges an array of expeditions to various locations.\n\nThe expeditions the society has been connected with fall into three categories:\n\nMost notably:\n\nA Transcontinental Excursion was arranged and executed by the AGS in 1912. The idea for this excursion was generated by Professor William Morris Davis who, in 1908 \"tried the unique experiment of conducting a geographical excursion in Europe, open to students of European and American universities\". The excursion promoted the acquaintance of European geographers with Americans.\n\nCurrently, the AGS sends teams of scholars to improve U.S. understanding of foreign lands and peoples, in order to reduce international misunderstandings and improve humanitarian assistance in case of natural disasters, technological accidents, terrorist acts and war. The organization aims to build a multi-scale Geographic information system (GIS) for each world region, collect unclassified GIS data, conduct participatory GIS, train a new caliber of regional experts, disseminate GIS data freely to the public and publish the results in popular media and scholarly journal. Each expedition is titled a Bowman Expedition, in honor of past AGS Director, Isaiah Bowman.\n\nOthers include:\n\n\nThe AGS archive contains field notes, original maps, sketches, photographs, journals, artifacts, correspondence, expedition flags and memorabilia, field equipment, telegrams, press clippings, event programs, radio logs, meeting records, and many other documents and artifacts. In 2011 the AGS of NY and the AGS Library at UW Milwaukee began a project to organize, rehouse and create the finding aid for the society archives.\n\nThe AGS Library was transferred to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1978. It holds a large collection of material from Latin American and the Polar Regions and contains over one-million items, some dating back to the 15th century.\n\nSince 1984, the AGS have organized a Travel Program, sponsoring in excess of 250 educational trips for the general public. The AGS Travel Program lecturers are professional geographers, fellows of the society and authorities on the regions traveled. Trips are conducted through various means of travel, including private jet and ship.\n\nThe American Geographical Society acquired its Fliers' & Explorers' Globe in 1929 as a gift from AGS President John H. Finley. In his position as editor-in-chief of \"The New York Times\", Finley invited early heroes of exploration and aviation to draw their routes and sign their names on his 18-inch globe. The society has continued the custom and has created a symbol of humanity's drive to explore the universe.\n\nSigners of the Fliers' & Explorers' Globe over the years are men and women who have explored certain places on earth for the first time in recorded history, reached new extremes of height or depth, pioneered new means of travel, or set aviation records. Among them are such people as Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, Sir Edmund Hillary, William Beebe, Louise Arner Boyd and the Apollo 13 astronauts.\n\nSigners of the Fliers' & Explorers' Globe are proposed by AGS' Exploration Committee for approval by the AGS Honors Committee and confirmation by the AGS Council.\n\nList of Fliers' & Explorers' Globe Signers\n\nThe AGS presents a number of awards and medals:\n\n\n\n"}

He was quoted as saying:\n\nRyan told the NFL Network for their Top Ten Nicknames show:\nDuring the Cowboys' first game of the 1979 season, a nationally televised game against the St. Louis Cardinals (Dallas won 22-21), the television announcer for CBS introduced the Cowboys as America's Team and the name stuck.\n\nDallas' Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry originally did not approve of the appellation of America's Team. He felt that it would give opposing teams extra incentive to play harder. Eventually he gave in and actually came to like the name. The nickname was coined at the height of Landry's then-NFL record 20 consecutive winning season streak, during which Dallas appeared in 12 conference championship games (counting the 1966-67 league championships) and five Super Bowls, and was exemplified on the field by the iconic Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach, but the team's popularity has continued over the decades during periods of both mediocrity and dynastic success.\n\nIn 2003, NFL Films released a DVD collection chronicling the Dallas Cowboys franchise entitled \"The Dallas Cowboys: The Complete History of America's Team 1960-2003\". In 2008, NFL Films would release an updated DVD of The History of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe popularity of the Cowboys as America's Team has been supported by such NFL records as \"Team with Most Consecutive Sold Out Games\", a streak of 160 home and away games (including playoffs) that began on December 23, 1990, at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium and came to an end on December 24, 1999, in a Christmas Eve game against the New Orleans Saints in the Louisiana Superdome. Other examples are the NFL games featuring the Cowboys that result in record-breaking ratings at the time of broadcast, such as 7 of the 8 Super Bowl games featuring the Cowboys and the NFC Championship Game between the Cowboys and 49ers, the only non-Super Bowl NFL game to be ranked in the Top 45 Primetime Telecasts of All Time. Dallas is the only NFL team that distributes its own merchandise, which remains among the league's top selling even during losing seasons. As of 2012 the Cowboys were the most valuable American sports franchise at $2.1 billion. Among the many Cowboys innovations that have contributed to their distinct reputation are their professional, overtly beautiful, all female cheerleader squad, nicknamed \"America's Sweethearts\", that has since been copied around the NFL but still stands out as singularly iconic, and has been the subject of multiple movies, has made numerous national television appearances, routinely tours with the USO, makes other appearances around the world, and has been featured in its own long running on CMT.\n\nIn 2012 an ESPN poll found that the Cowboys are the most popular NFL team, a result consistently echoed in annual Harris polling.\n\nFranchises with long successful histories and large nationwide fan bases are occasionally referred to as America's Team.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves laid claim to the name due to their games being broadcast on cable television systems nationwide on WTBS, building a fan base in areas of the United States far removed from a Major League Baseball team. A 1982 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\" had referred to the Braves as \"America's Team II\".\n\nAs a jab against the Cowboys before Super Bowl XXVII, Buffalo Bills coach Marv Levy proclaimed his team to be America's Team because they would be \"wearing red, white, and blue\". The Cowboys, whose team colors are navy blue, silver and white, went on to defeat the Bills 52-17.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney dismissed the suggestion that the Steelers were \"America's Team.\" \"'We didn't want that,' Rooney said. 'We're Pittsburgh's team. We feel strongly about that.'\"\n\nIn an ESPN.com article titled, \"The Great Debate: 'America's Team',\" four sports writers stated their case as to why three other teams besides the Cowboys could lay claim to the nickname of America's Team.\n\n\nFollowing their win in Super Bowl XLIV, a few media writers referred to the New Orleans Saints as \"America's Team\", as their successful bid to win the Super Bowl was seen by many to represent the city's resurgence after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina (\"for one game, the Saints are America's Team\").\n\nAfter several \"Cinderella\" runs in the NCAA tournament, the Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team has been called \"America's Team\" as well.\n\nDuring their ArenaBowl XXII championship run in 2008, Philadelphia Soul owner Ron Jaworski referred to the Soul as \"America's Team\" of the Arena Football League.\n\n"}

In 1793 the inventor and industrialist, Matthew Boulton, noted a recipe in one of his notebooks for a soup was which intended to be sold for a penny a quart. This was a hearty broth made up of stewed beef and vegetables served with a slice of bread. In 2014, Glynn Purnell recreated the dish as a fine dining course and served it at his restaurant, \"Purnell's\".\n\nA dish titled \"Brummie bacon cakes\" is said to also be a dish local to Birmingham it consists of a mixture of flour, salt, and butter or margarine, with chopped bacon and cheese added to it. With the addition of Worcestershire sauce, ketchup and milk, the mixture is made into a dough and sliced into wedges which are then baked with cheese sprinkled over them.\n\nDishes identified with the neighbouring Black Country are also traditionally popular in Birmingham, including faggots and peas and, in the past, groaty pudding made with beef, leeks, onions and oat groats.\n\nThe dish which originated in Kashmiri restaurants in Birmingham in the 1970s the Balti should also be considered as a local dish (see below).\n\nDuring the 1830s, Thomas Ridgway began trading in the Bull Ring, selling tea. Ridgway later went bankrupt. Setting up business in London, he paid back all of his creditors and continued his tea trade, becoming one of the first English tea companies to hygienically pre-pack tea so as to avoid adulteration. In 1876, Queen Victoria commanded House of Ridgways to create a blend for her own personal use. In 1863, William Sumner (founder of Typhoo) published \"A Popular Treatise on Tea\". In 1870, Sumner started a pharmacy and grocery business in High Street in Birmingham city centre. This grew and forced Sumner to move to new premises on Castle Street and then on to Bordesley Street at the canalside. Typhoo was bought by Indian conglomerate company Apeejay Surrendra Group on 31 October 2005.\n\nBirmingham's earliest food trade connections with the West Indies involved the importation of limes and cocoa during the mid-to-late 19th century. \nThe Montserrat Co. Ltd. was formed in Edgbaston by J.& E. Sturge. Lime juice was produced in the city and then exported for use in the manufacture of citric acid. The failure of Sicily's lemon crop at that time resulted in an opening in the market which Sturge took great advantage of, utilizing their extensive chemical works based in Edgbaston. The company was set up by the Sturge and Albright families who funded the development of Montserrat estates in 1867. Joseph Sturge bought the Elberton Sugar Estate in 1857 and converted it into a lime production plant. He also wanted to prove that free labour could be made profitable. Members of the Sturge family were instrumental in the British anti-slavery movement.\n\nFamous food brands that originated in Birmingham include Typhoo tea, Bird's Custard, Bournville cocoa, Cadbury chocolate, and HP Sauce.\n\n\"The Old Crown\" public house, a black and white timber-framed building, is said to be the oldest secular building in Birmingham, dating back to 1450 to 1500. It is situated in Deritend and is documented as serving as an inn from 1626. Birmingham Corporation proposed its demolition in 1851, 1856 and 1862 but it was saved by the efforts of Joshua Toulman Smith. It is still used as a public house which serves food. \"The Saracen's Head\" in Kings Norton dates from the same period as The Old Crown and is now a visitor's centre with a snack bar. The work to restore The Saracen's Head came as a result of it being chosen for financial assistance by a vote of the viewers of the BBC television programme \"Restoration\" in 2004.\n\nThe Leicester Arms, which became known as Freeth's Coffee House, situated at the corner of Bell Street and Lease Lane, served as a tavern and coffee house from 1736 to 1832. It served as a meeting place for small businessmen and lawyers and, when bought by John Freeth, a topical ballad writer, in the second half of the 18th century, it became a place for groups which supported radical politics, including the Birmingham Book Club, which held dinners at the coffee house. Freeth sent out rhyming invitations to dinner to club members. The club was recorded as having 24 members in 1775.\n\nMrs. Ann Allday, the wife of Joseph Allday who was a leading Birmingham Councillor from 1849 to 1859, ran a \"celebrated\" tripe restaurant and tripe shop in Union Street and other councillors often met there. At that time the \"Woodman Tavern\" in Easy Row was also a favoured meeting place for Allday and his colleagues.\n\nA more recent hostelry of note is \"The Garrison\" in Dale End which served as a model for the public house by that name featured in the BBC television drama series \"Peaky Blinders\". The real public house was sold at auction for £183,000 in May 2014.\n\nA fish restaurant was opened in Warwick Passage in 1883.\n\nIn 1896 a new building in the Arts and Crafts style was erected in Corporation Street to house James Henry Cook's vegetarian restaurant, one of the first in England. In 1898, 'The Pitman Vegetarian Hotel', named after the famous vegetarian Sir Isaac Pitman, was opened on the same site, and the proprietors subsequently opened a long-running health food store. It is said that Mahatma Gandhi dined at the restaurant when he visited Birmingham on 18 October 1931.\n\nIn the latter years of the Victorian era, a number of Italians migrated to Birmingham and occupied a small number of streets off Digbeth and by 1914 they numbered about 700 people, mostly originating from villages around Rome. Many were street-traders and sold the first ice cream in the city using broken eggs from the egg market in Moor Street and ice from Fazeley Street. Camillo Biglio opened a confectioner's shop in Cannon Street in 1878 and, afterwards, is thought to have opened the first Italian restaurant in Birmingham, \"\". \n\nBirmingham is home to a wide variety of Asian eateries which have served the people of Birmingham since the 1940s. The first Chinese restaurant was the Tong Kung on Holloway Head, which opened in 1956. In the late 1950s there were also Kam Ling in Livery Street and Tung Hing at 15 Snow Hill. Notable also were The Slow Boat, opened in 1961 under St. Martin's car park (this business failed after a public health action for the use of illegal meat in its dishes), Heaven Bridge in Smallbrook Queensway, and, by 1968, The Old Happy Gathering in Pershore Street, which offered more authentic Cantonese cuisine, the earliest restaurants being more in the style of \"chop suey houses\".\n\nIn the early 1970s Chinese businesses and community associations were gathered around Hurst Street and Digbeth and Wing Yip opened the first Chinese supermarket in Bromsgrove Street, establishing a food empire in Birmingham which now has its headquarters in the Chinese Quarter, along with other fine oriental restaurants.\n\nIn 1945 Abdul Aziz, one of the first East Bengali (later known as Bangladeshi) immigrants to live in Birmingham, opened a cafe shop selling curry and rice in Steelhouse Lane with many policemen from the local police station as customers as well as lawyers and barristers who worked at the nearby law courts. This later became The Darjeeling and was the first Asian restaurant in Birmingham, owned by Afrose Miah. The second Asian restaurant in Birmingham was The Shah Bagh on Bristol Street. In 1957 Mozamel and Rachel Kazi changed the nature of their cafe, 'Rae's Cafe' in Bristol Street, from a 'greasy spoon' to a shop where curry was served and its resulting popularity necessitated that it be moved to larger premises in Moseley Road where it was called 'Jinnah's'. John Bonham who became the drummer in the group Led Zeppelin dined there regularly. The Kazis' son, John, came up with the novel idea of home delivery of food to regular customers as well as a 'takeaway' service whereby customers took their own pots to the restaurant to have them filled with curry and rice for 25p. Also noteworthy was The Curry House opened by Abdul Motin Choudhury and Abdul Jabbar on Bristol Street in 1965 which was later to become the Aloka in 1981. There was also the Banu restaurant on Hagley Road, which was opened in 1969. \n\nThe dish known as balti was invented in Birmingham in the 1970s in restaurants owned by members of the Pakistani community in Sparkbrook, many of whom had migrated to the city from the Mirpur area of Pakistan in the 1960s. When non-Pakistani customers began to visit their restaurants, they required curries to be cooked more quickly than occurred in traditional Mirpuri cuisine and the restaurateurs consequently developed dishes in which meat was cooked off the bone at higher temperatures in steel dishes with fresh dried spices rather than curry pastes and vegetable oil in place of the traditional ghee. The steel dishes in which the food was cooked were called \"baltis\" (said to derive from the Hindi word \"balty\" meaning a bucket) and then the food was served in the steel dishes with naan bread.\n\nThe geographical area in which the balti serving restaurants were concentrated became known as the Balti Triangle and is defined as having a northern apex at the junction of the A41 and A453 Camp Hill roundabout, an eastern boundary of the A41 going south to Stratford Road, a western boundary of the A453 and a southern edge just north of Wake Green Road and College Road. A visit to a restaurant in the Balti Triangle is often promoted as an important activity for tourists visiting Birmingham.\n\nThe first recorded written reference to balti dishes was made in a 1984 edition of \"Curry Magazine\" and it is said that as of 2016 there are about balti 50 restaurants located in The Balti Triangle. In 1998, the balti restaurateurs formed themselves into the Birmingham Balti Association.\n\nIn the city centre, among current notable south Asian restaurants are the \"Rajdoot\" in George Street in the Jewellery Quarter, which serves North Indian cuisine and which was opened in 1966, and which lists among its former notable customers The Beatles, The Princess Margaret and, more recently, the television personality Simon Cowell. In Hurst Street is The Maharajah, which also serves North Indian cuisine, having opened there in 1971. It was the Egon Ronay \"Indian Restaurant of the Year\" in 1999 and among its former notable customers were John Major, Cliff Richard, and Take That. \n\nOff St. Paul's Square in James Street is located Lasan, which opened in 2002 and which won \"Gordon Ramsay's F Word Best Local Restaurant\" award on Channel 4 television. The then chef-director, Aktar Islam, has appeared in BBC's \"Great British Menu\" three times: in 2013 and 2014, as well as in 2011 when his dish of sea bass with battered soft shell crab won the fish course category. Islam left his role at Lasan in late 2017 and opened two new restaurants in Summer Row in May 2018 and December 2018 respectively – Opheem, which serves progressive Indian cuisine, and the neighbouring Legna, which has since closed.\n\nOutside the city centre and Balti Triangle, the many suburbs of Birmingham are home to numerous South Asian-style restaurants, some of which are award-winning, an example being Thania Spice, situated in the small suburb of West Heath, whose chef, Abdul Subhan, was awarded the \"Curry Life\" award of 2013 as one of the 42 best curry chefs in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter World War II, the Berni brothers (Frank and Aldo), two Welshmen of Italian ancestry, established what became known as a \"Berni Inn\" in Bristol in 1955. European-style food was served there and a classic menu of prawn cocktail starter, steak or chicken in a basket main course and Black Forest gateau dessert became familiar to British diners. Branches of Berni Inns gradually extended throughout the West Country and the English Midlands and further afield but it was not until 1967–8 that Berni Inns were opened in Birmingham – the Wagon and Horses and the White Swan.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, the restaurant of The Plough And Harrow Hotel in Hagley Road in Edgbaston was considered to be one of Birmingham's finest dining venues. Andreas Antona was head chef at The Plough And Harrow from 1987 for three years before opening Simpson's in Kenilworth in 1993 (see below). The Plough And Harrow is situated in a building dating back to 1704.\n\nIn 2005, Opus was opened by entrepreneur Ann Tonks and Chef Director David Colcombe in Cornwall Street and the restaurant subsequently won several awards as a modern British restaurant. David Colcombe left his post there in 2015. In his training he had studied at Solihull College and afterward under Anton Mosimann at the Dorchester Hotel in London and then the Lygon Arms in Broadway, Worcestershire. He later worked at the former Swallow Hotel in Birmingham (now The Marriott Hotel). After Colcombe's departure, Birmingham-born Ben Ternent was promoted in May 2015 from Head Chef to Executive Chef at Opus. The restaurant put a particular emphasis on \"sustainability\" of foods.\nIn \"The Good Food Guide\" list of the Top 50 British restaurants for 2017, Simpson's was placed in the number 35 position and Adam's was placed at number 41 in the table. This was the first time that Simpson's had appeared in the Top 50 list but it was not included in the 2019 list. Adam's had occupied the number 29 place in the list in 2016 with no other Birmingham restaurants being included in the list in that year. The position of Adam's in the list was reduced to number 47 in the 2019 list. Purnell's was placed in the number 38 place in the 2014 list, at number 37 in the 2013 list and at number 47 in the 2010 list. \n\nNine Birmingham restaurants (Adam's, Carter's of Moseley, Folium, Harborne Kitchen, Lasan, Opus, Purnell's, Purnell's Bistro and Simpsons) were included in the 2019 Good Food Guide listings compared with 11 the previous year (Two Cats Kitchen, Edmund's and Turner's at No. 69 having closed and only Folium having been added to the list). \n\n\"The Good Food Guide 2020\" increased the number of listed Birmingham restaurants back to 11 (‘cooking scores’ in brackets): Adam's (7) Carter's Of Moseley (6), Folium (4), Harborne Kitchen (6), Lasan (3), Opheem (4), Opus (2), The Oyster Club (4), Purnell's (6), Purnell's Bistro (2) and Simpsons (6), with Adam's being the only Birmingham restaurant to appear in its ‘The Top 50, The UK’s best restaurants’, being placed at number 49 (a fall of 2 places since 2019).\n\nThe dining scene in Birmingham continues to evolve and notable restaurants included Two Cats Kitchen, which opened in Warstone Lane in the Jewellery Quarter in July 2015 after a period of operating as a pop-up restaurant called Two Cats Roaming. Its Midlands-born chef and owner, Niki Astley, who established the restaurant with his Latvian partner Diana Fjordorova, had previously worked at White Horse in Fulham and The Church in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter. Two Cats Kitchen specialised in \"New Baltic Cuisine\" and intended to \"shed light on Baltic-Russian cuisine by recognising traditional dishes and attempting new ones\". Notable dishes were \"Beetroot and buttermilk Gazpacho\" and a dessert of celeriac ice cream pears, birch biscuit and verbena. The 2017 edition of the Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland included \"Two Cats\" in its listing of Birmingham restaurants. In March 2017 Astley announced that the food presented at Two Cats would have less emphasis on \"New Baltic\" food and would be given a \"wider culinary exploration\" but the restaurant closed on 30 September 2017.\n\nThe Wilderness, founded by Alex Claridge, began life as Nomad in April 2015, a pop-up restaurant initially situated at the Kitchen Garden Cafe in Kings Heath. Prior to founding Nomad, Claridge had worked at the Warehouse Cafe in Digbeth and Bistro 1847 in Great Western Arcade. The restaurant opened in the Birmingham Open Media building in Dudley Street in November 2015, with Brian Smith working as head chef. The restaurant aimed to serve British food with ingredients taken from the restaurant's own allotments as well as from foraging, but it closed on 7 May 2016, after being threatened with legal action by the NoMad Hotel in New York, and reopened as The Wilderness on 25 May 2016 with new internal decorations. Claridge closed The Wilderness on 29 December 2017, intending to reopen in February 2018 in the building in Bennett's Hill which was formerly occupied by Adam's, but work was delayed and the restaurant reopened in March 2018 in a temporary location in Warstone Lane in the building which had formerly housed Two Cats Kitchen and before that, La Toque D'Or. \n\nStu Deeley, who won the BBC One television series \"MasterChef: The Professionals\" 2019, was head chef at The Wilderness until December 2019, when he left to open his own restaurant in the Jewellery Quarter and was succeeded by Marius Gedminas who had been a sous chef at the restaurant. Deeley had studied at Halesowen College and previously worked at Simpsons.\n\nClaridge opened a new restaurant in Bennett's Hill in November 2018 with the name of Nocturnal Animals. The head chef of Nocturnal Animals (named after the 2016 movie, and inspired by the film's 1980s-inspired soundtrack) was Brett Connor, a former competitor on BBC's \"Masterchef The Professionals\". The food was influenced by Japanese and Far Eastern cuisine, but customers were confused by the restaurant's theme and so its name was changed on 20 March 2019 to Kisama. Pedro Miranda, who had previously worked at Rofuto in the Park Regis Hotel in Broad Street, was appointed head chef and the theme of Japanese/Far Eastern cuisine was emphasised. Miranda left the post in July 2019 and Claridge ended his involvement with Kisama on 9 August, resulting in the restaurant's closure on 13 August 2019. \n\nIn the mid-2010s there was a growing trend to the establishment of \"pop-up\" restaurants in Birmingham whereby a chef would establish a temporary restaurant for varying periods of time in non-permanent and different locations. For the period that Adam's Restaurant existed in Bennett's Hill, it termed itself a pop-up restaurant. As mentioned above, both Niki Astley and Alex Claridge used the device of serving their food in pop-up restaurants before opening their own more permanent establishments. The Kitchen Garden Cafe in Kings Heath has often hosted pop-up restaurants. The chef, Ben Tesh, worked from a pop-up restaurant at the Kitchen Garden. He had initially trained at Colin McGurran's Michelin-starred Winteringham Fields restaurant in north-east Lincolnshire and then been head chef at Anthony's Restaurant in Leeds, as well as gaining experience at Noma in Denmark under René Redzepi. In 2013 he worked under Alex Bond at Turner's restaurant in Harborne. He later ran his pop-up restaurant in Birmingham from 2016 until 8 April 2017 for nine months at the Urban Coffee Company in Church Street and eventually opened his first permanent restaurant, Folium, in Caroline Street in the Jewellery Quarter in late November 2017.\n\nAndrew Sheridan heads up the kitchen at Craft Dining Rooms, which was opened in the International Conference Centre on 15 July 2019 by Sam and Emma Morgan. Sheridan collaborated with Kray Treadwell, who had worked at Michael O’Hare's The Man Behind The Curtain in Leeds for three and half years in serving dinners in which each cooked alternate courses in late 2019. Treadwell began his career in a junior role at Simpsons, moving to Glynn Purnell's The Asquith, The Blind Swine in York and thence to Leeds. In early 2020 Tredwell hosted several pop-up dinners at the Selina Hotel in Livery Street in the Jewellery Quarter whilst working on plans to open his own restaurant named 670 Grams after the birth weight of his daughter in the Custard Factory in Digbeth but the restaurant’s opening was delayed because of the shutdown of restaurants necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic of spring 2020. \n\nDigbeth Dining Club, a weekly street food market, opened in August 2012 by former cameraman Jack Brabant. On 17 and 18 September 2016 the British Street Food Annual Awards was held at the site. From January 2017 the Digbeth Dining Club was held two evenings per week, Fridays and Saturdays, with the emphasis on Saturdays being on music and street entertainment.\n\nBirmingham has numerous restaurants which are parts of nationwide chains. In April 2018 The Ivy Temple Row opened in a location close to Birmingham Cathedral. This restaurant is part of the chain based on the original Ivy restaurant opened in Covent Garden in 1917.. On 1 February 2019 the Smith Brothers opened the third branch of their contemporary Chinese restaurant, Tattu, in the refurbished old boiler room of The Grand Hotel in Barwick Street, the original restaurant having been opened in Manchester in 2015.\n\nThe Birmingham dining scene in the 1970s is highlighted by the 1974 edition of the \"Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland\" which was the first edition of the British guide to have been published since 1931. The Guide mentioned the following restaurants in Birmingham and its surroundings: \"Lorenzo\" in Park Street (Italian), \"La Capanna\" in Hurst Street (Italian), \"Lambert Court\" on Hagley Road, \"Burlington\" off New Street, \"Danish Food Centre\" in Stephenson Place, the \"Royal\" in Sutton Coldfield and \"Manor House\" in West Bromwich. There were no starred restaurants at that time in Birmingham.\n\nBy the mid 1980s Italian restaurants were still prominent in the Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland and the 1983 edition listed \"Rajdoot\" (see above, then located in Albert Street), \"Jonathan's\" (English cuisine) on Wolverhampton Road, \"Pinocchio\" (Italian) off Harborne Road, and \"Giovanni's\" (Italian) in Kings Heath, along with the previously mentioned Italian restaurants, \"Lorenzo's\" and \"La Capanna\". The list also included \"La Gondola\" (Italian) and \"Le Bon Viveur\", both in Sutton Coldfield, and \"Franzi's\", an Austrian-style restaurant located in Bearwood. No restaurants in Birmingham then held a star rating.\n\nA decade later, the 1993 Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland was dramatically changed in the style of cuisine featured in its listing with the most highly rated restaurant being \"Sir Edward Elgar's\" at the Swallow Hotel in Hagley Road, followed by \"Sloan's\" in Edgbaston. The other listed restaurants were South Asian or Chinese in style:- \"Maharaja\" in Hurst Street, \"Purple Rooms\" (Indian) in Hall Green, Henry's (Chinese) in St. Paul's Square, \"Henry Wong\" (Chinese) in Harborne, \"Days of the Raj\" in Dale End and \"Dynasty\" (Chinese) in Hurst Street. \"Franzl's\" (Austrian) in Bearwood continued to appear in the list and \"Lombard Room\" in Kings Norton was also listed.\n\nBy the turn of the millennium, European-style restaurants had become far more prominent in Michelin's Birmingham lists and the 2001 \"Michelin The Red Guide Great Britain and Ireland\" recommended \"Sir Edward Elgar's\" at the Marriot Hotel, formerly the Swallow Hotel, \"Number 282\" at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, \"Gilmore\" situated in a former rolling mill in the Jewellery Quarter, the \"Metro Bar and Grill\" in Cornwall Street, \"Leftbank\" in Broad Street and \"Le Petit Blanc\" in Brindleyplace. Only two non-European restaurants then appeared in the list:- \"Henry's\" in St. Paul's Square and \"Mizan\" in Hall Green.\n\nBy the time of the publication of the Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland 2005 edition, British and French style-restaurants dominated the lists and set the scene for the next decade or so. The edition listed Birmingham's first two restaurants with single stars, \"Simpson's\" and \"Jessica's\" (see below), along with \"Paris\" in The Mailbox, \"Bank\" in Brindleyplace, \"La Toque D'or\" in the Jewellery Quarter, the \"Metro Bar and Grill\", the \"Zinc Bar and Grill\" in Gas Street Basin, \"Liaison \" in Hall Green and \"Le Petit Blanc\". The Indian-style restaurants listed were \"Cafe Lazeez\" (north Indian) in The Mailbox and \"Shimla Pinks\" in Broad Street with \"Henry's\" Chinese-style restaurant continuing to appear in the list along with \"Buonissimo\" (Italian) in Harborne.\n\nBy the time of the publication of the 2017 Michelin Guide the city had five starred restaurants with two more in the city's close vicinity: \"Simpson's\" in Edgbaston, which retained its 1 star grading which had been awarded to it in 2005; \"Purnell's\" in Cornwall Street in the city centre and \"Turner's at 69\" in Harborne, both of which had been awarded 1 star in 2009; \"Adam's\", which relocated to Waterloo Street in 2016, and had been awarded 1 star in 2013; and \"Carter's of Moseley\" which was awarded 1 star in the 2016 Michelin Guide. \"Peel's Restaurant at Hampton Manor\" in Hampton-in-Arden, under its Head Chef, Robert Palmer, was awarded its star for the first time in the 2017 Guide and \"The Cross At Kenilworth\" had achieved its first star in 2014. Birmingham has more Michelin-starred restaurants in Great Britain than any other city apart from London \n\nApart from the starred restaurants mentioned above, \"Opus at Cornwall Street\", \"Andy Waters\", \"Two Cats\" and the two Asian-style restaurants \"Lasan\" and \"Asha's\" in Newhall Street were mentioned in the 2017 edition of the Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland. In the 2018 edition, these restaurants were all awarded the newly introduced \"Michelin Plate\" (\"Good cooking. Fresh ingredients, carefully prepared: simply a good meal\") apart from \"Two Cats\" which had closed. \"Turner's at 69\" which had lost its Michelin star and \"The Wilderness\" also received the new award. In 2019 the 'Michelin Plate' was awarded again to all of those which received the 2018 award apart from 'Lasan' after Aktar Islam had moved from the restaurant and 'Turner's at 69' which had closed while Ben Tesh's 'Folium', 'Harborne Kitchen' and Aktar Islam's new restaurant 'Opheem' all received the award, therefore increasing the number of Michelin Plate restaurants in Birmingham to seven.\n\nThere were no changes to Birmingham's star status in the 2019 Michelin awards but Paul Foster's 'Salt', opened in 2017, was awarded a single star in nearby Stratford upon Avon. In the 2020 Michelin star awards ceremony on 7 October 2019, Aktar Islam's ‘Opheem’ was awarded one star and the city therefore returned to the status of being home to 5 Michelin stars.\n\nAdam Stokes, originally from Northampton, opened \"Adam’s\" with his wife Natasha as a \"2 year pop-up\" restaurant in Bennett's Hill in 2013. He had previously worked up to Sous Chef under Aaron Patterson at Hambleton Hall in Leicestershire and then in 2008, at the age of 26, became Head Chef at Glenapp Castle in the Scottish Lowlands and achieved his first Michelin star there a few days before his 30th birthday. He relocated \"Adam's\" to Waterloo Street in January 2016 having been awarded a Michelin star for \"Adam's\" in 2014. In 2017 the restaurant was awarded the title \"Best Fine Dining Restaurant\" at the Midlands Food Drinks And Hospitality awards. Tom Shepherd who had worked previously at Restaurant Sat Bains in Nottingham was appointed Head Chef in July 2017.\n\nStokes opened a second restaurant in Temple Street in the city centre on 1 April 2019. Specialising in fish and seafood dishes it is named ‘The Oyster Club’ and the Head Chef is Rosanne Moseley who worked for Stokes at ‘Adam’s’ from February 2014 until she took up her post at the new restaurant. Moseley was a participant in the BBC television ‘Masterchef - The Professionals’ during the time she worked at ‘Adam’s’.\n\nCarters of Moseley was opened in November 2010 by chef Brad Carter and his partner, Holly Jackson, to serve British cuisine. Brad Carter had studied at University College, Birmingham (previously the Birmingham College of Food) and then worked in Marseilles and Menorca and Michelin-starred restaurants in southern England and London. His restaurant was given the Good Food Guide Restaurant of the Year award in 2015 and achieved 1 star in the 2016 Michelin Guide. In the Birmingham Food, Drink and Hospitality Awards of June 2016, Holly Jackson was named Best Restaurant Manager. In the renamed Midlands Food, Drink and Hospitality Awards of 2017, Brad Carter was named Best Chef. In 2018 the restaurant was placed in the number 66 position of the Estrella National Restaurant Awards having occupied the number 91 position in 2016 and having been unplaced in 2017.\n\nPurnell's Chef-Proprietor, Glynn Purnell, was formerly chef at \"Jessica's\" on Portland Road in Edgbaston, which opened in July 2003 by Keith and Diane Stevenson and was awarded AA Restaurant of the Year within one year of opening. Jessica's was awarded 1 Michelin star in 2005 and retained it until the restaurant closed in 2007, when Glynn Purnell and his wife and partner, Kerry O'Carroll, decided to open their own restaurant in Cornwall Street. The former Jessica's was reopened by the former Maitre D', Pascal Cluny, as Pascal's and it was awarded a Michelin Bib in 2008. Subsequently, Glynn Purnell acquired the building to open a restaurant called \"The Asquith\" but this was relocated to Newhall Street and later renamed \"Purnell's Bistro\". The building which had housed Jessica's was eventually converted into luxury apartments.\n\nGlynn Purnell, who had once worked as a Chef de Partie and then Sous Chef at Simpson's in Kenilworth, is a familiar face on British television food programmes and won The Great British Menu competition for 2 consecutive years (2008, with strawberries with tarragon and black pepper honeycomb with burnt English cream surprise and, in 2009, with masala spiced monkfish with red lentils, pickled carrots, and coconut). Purnell's first book, \"Cracking Yolks And Pig Tales\", was published in 2014. In 2016, Purnell became one of the regular guest hosts on the BBC television programme \"Saturday Kitchen\". In the Birmingham Food, Drink and Hospitality Awards of June 2016 Glynn Purnell was chosen Best Chef and Purnell's Restaurant was named Best Michelin Star Restaurant. Purnell's second book, \"Rib-ticklers & Choux-ins\", containing 110 recipes, was published on 15 September 2016.\n\nBefore opening Purnell's in July 2007, Glynn Purnell was quoted by the Birmingham Mail as saying that he hoped that the new restaurant would achieve the award of 2 Michelin stars in 5 to 7 years but that hope remains unfulfilled. The restaurant was awarded 1 Michelin star in 2009. The first Maitre D' at Purnell's was Jean Benoit Burloux who had previously worked in a more junior role at Jessica's. He was succeeded by Sonal Clare in 2014 who began work at Purnell's in 2008 as a waiter and was awarded the Best Sommelier Award at the GQ Food and Drink Awards 2018 in May 2018. Sonal Clare left Purnell's on 21 December 2019 to work as General Manager and Head Sommelier at The Wilderness from January 2020. He was succeeded at Purnell's by Jared Samborski in January 2020.\n\nIn June 2018 Purnell was asked to create a dish to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the beginning of work to construct 'Spaghetti Junction', the Gravelley Hill roadway interchange, and he received considerable publicity for his dish of potato and celeriac 'spaghetti' with a cream and ginger sauce finished off with truffle.\n\nIn 2004, Andreas Antona opened Simpson's Restaurant in Edgbaston Birmingham, within a Grade II-listed building. Antona founded the original Simpson's in Kenilworth in 1993, which was awarded a Michelin star in the Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland 2000. Chef Director Luke Tipping had previously been Chef at Simpson's in Kenilworth. Andreas Antona was later to establish a restaurant at \"The Cross\" in Kenilworth where the Head Chef is Adam Bennett, who had worked for Antona at Simpson's in Kenilworth and subsequently, has been Head Chef in the Edgbaston restaurant. The name \"Simpson's\" was taken from the chemist's shop, belonging to Antona's father-in-law, which occupied the site in Kenilworth before Antona opened his restaurant there. After the Edgbaston restaurant had been closed for a short period for redecoration towards the end of 2015, Nathan Eades, who previously had had his own restaurant for a short while in nearby Bromsgrove, took over as Head Chef from Matt Cheal who left to open his own restaurant, \"Cheal's of Henley\" in the village of Henley in Arden, between Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. Nathan Eades left Simpson's in December 2017 to work at the 'Wild Rabbit Inn' in Kingham. Previously, Andy Waters, another former Head Chef of Simpsons, had had a restaurant, \"Edmund's\", in Henley in Arden before moving it to Birmingham and then going on to open \"Waters In The Square\" at Five Ways and then the restaurant \"Andy Waters\" at Resorts World at the National Exhibition Centre. In November 2018 Waters announced that he was giving up his role at the Resorts World restaurant and Aaron Darnley became Head Chef there with the restaurant's name being changed to 'Sky By Waters'. Andy Waters became Head Chef at ‘Pebble Beach’ restaurant in Barton-on-Sea in Hampshire in October 2019. Cheal's of Henley received the Judges Choice Award in the Birmingham Food, Drink And Hospitality Awards in June 2016. Corin Ireland of Simpsons was named Best Sommelier in the same awards. In 2018 PETA (The People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals Foundation) included Simpsons in a list of the 10 best restaurants to serve vegan food in Britain. Luke Tipping was appointed Honorary Professor of Culinary Arts at University College Birmingham in 2010. At one time Simpson's had three winners of the 'British Culinary Federation Chef Of The Year' award - Luke Tipping, Adam Bennett and Matt Cheal - all working there at the same time.\n\nTurner's Restaurant (later known as \"Turner's at 69\") on the High Street in Harborne was opened by Midlands-born Richard Turner in 2007 and was awarded 1 Michelin star in January 2009. Turner's work had previously included some years at Thrales Restaurant in Lichfield which was closed in 2011. Alex Bond later worked at Turner's as Head Chef while Richard Turner was Executive Chef. The restaurant specialised in French and British cuisine. On 9 June 2016, Richard Turner announced that he was intending to change the style of the restaurant to make the atmosphere more relaxed and to replace the serving of expensive multi-course \"tasting menus\" with an a la carte menu from August 2016. Following these changes Turner's at 69 lost its Michelin star in the 2018 Michelin Guide but was awarded a Michelin Plate. The restaurant closed on 15 January 2018. In May 2018 Richard Turner took on the post of Head Chef in the newly opened \"Maribel\" in Brindley Place in the location which had previously housed \"Edmund's\" but ceased to work there one year later in May 2019 and was replaced as Head Chef by Harvey Perttola who had worked previously at ‘Opus’, ‘Hampton Manor’ and Swinfen Hall in Lichfield.\n\nAktar Islam's Opheem was awarded a single star on 7 October 2019 as part of the 2020 Michelin star awards. The restaurant's history is described above in more detail.\n\nPeel's Restaurant was opened in 2008 by the Hill family. On 3 October 2016 they were awarded a Michelin-star and Michelin's Welcome and service award. Two weeks prior they won their fourth AA-rosette.\n\nFairs and festivals dedicated to food were held in the Bullring during the 18th and 19th centuries though William de Birmingham had gained permission for a three-day-long Ascensiontide fair in 1250 with an additional Michaelmas fair taking place by 1400. The most popular fair was the (Michaelmas) Onion Fair which celebrated the harvest of onions. It was held on the last Thursday of September in front of St. Martin's Church. In an article in The Illustrated London News published in October 1872 it was noted that dealers and customers of the fair were mainly \"the country folk of Warwickshire with a few tradesmen of the town and some of the work men's wives for the onion gives a palatable relish to a poor man's dinner or supper\". The sale of onions was accompanied by stalls, sideshows and amusements and special excursion trains were run to the event from all over the area but the sale of onions was separated from the amusements in 1875 with the latter moving to Aston to later become a large funfair. \n\nThe BBC Good Food Show takes place at The National Exhibition Centre and is Britain's biggest and most extensive food event.\n\nThe Colmore Food Festival has been held for 2 days in early July annually since 2011 in Victoria Square. It is organised by the Colmore Business District and highlights food and drink establishments in the area, offering members of the public the opportunity to sample food and drink and to attend cookery demonstrations by local chefs, including in the past, Glynn Purnell.\n\nIn recent years, a resurgent interest in local food has led to the growth of farmers markets. In line with other UK cities including London and Bristol, street food events have also gained in popularity, leading to national recognition.\n\nIn 2014, Birmingham Independent Food Fair at Millennium Point showcased local food businesses, with restaurants, producers, local brewing and distillery companies represented.\n\nOn 20 March 2020 all restaurants, public houses and bars in Birmingham and throughout England were closed on the orders of the government as a response to the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic which had taken hold in the country as part of the effort to reduce social contact which might otherwise have increased the spread of the virus.\n\nIn May 1998, the G8 Summit was held in Birmingham and the Summit banquet was held in Birmingham Botanical Gardens. The menu was constructed by Jonathan Harrison, Chef de Cuisine of The Swallow Hotel (see above), for the world leaders, including President Bill Clinton of The United States and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, and it was necessary to take note of foods which the leaders could not eat (Chancellor Kohl did not eat shellfish or lamb and President Clinton would not eat chocolate) and food eaten at other meals by the leaders beef and asparagus were being served elsewhere and so could not appear on Harrison's menu. The final menu was made up of pan-fried Dover sole served with baby leeks and seasonal mushrooms and a Mediterranean sauce; Basque-style pork wrapped in Parma ham, roasted and braised served with quenelles of polenta and braised artichoke base filled with roasted peppers, aubergines, fennel and courgettes; and, for dessert, glazed lemon and mascarpone tart. The menu reflected Jonathan Harrison's previous experience of working under Alain Ducasse at Hotel de France and his wish to combine British food with Mediterranean-style cuisine. Harrison provided the banquet for 56 guests; the 18 VIP guests being seated in the Pavilion of the Botanical Gardens. Jonathan Harrison left Birmingham in 1999 to become Chef Patron of The Sandpiper Inn in Leyburn in North Yorkshire.\n\nBirmingham chefs have won some notable competitions in recent years including those featured in popular television programmes.\n\nGlynn Purnell - (Purnell's) - Great British Menu\", Series 3, 2008 (BBC 1).

{"id": "1817350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817350", "title": "Radhabinod Pal", "text": "Radhabinod Pal\n\nRadhabinod Pal (27 January 1886 – 10 January 1967) was an Bengali jurist from British India present day Bangladesh, who was a member of the United Nations' International Law Commission from 1952 to 1966. He was one of three Asian judges appointed to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, the \"Tokyo Trials\" of Japanese war crimes committed during the Second World War. Among all the judges of the tribunal, he was the only one who submitted a judgment which insisted all defendants were not guilty. The Yasukuni Shrine and the Kyoto Ryozen Gokoku Shrine have monuments specially dedicated to Judge Pal.\n\nRadhabinod Pal was born in 1886 in the small village of Salimpur, Kushtia District, East Bengal, present Bangladesh.\n\nHe studied mathematics and constitutional law at Presidency College, Calcutta (now Kolkata), and the Law College of the University of Calcutta. \n\nPal was a major contributor to the formulation of the British Indian Income Tax Act of 1922. The British Government of India appointed Pal as a legal advisor in 1927. He worked as professor at the Law College of the University of Calcutta from 1923 till 1936. Pal became a judge of the Calcutta High Court in 1941 and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta in 1944.\n\nHe was a member representing British India as a member of the tribunal of judges officiating at the Tokyo Trials in 1946. In deliberations with judges from 10 other countries, Pal was highly critical of the prosecution's use of the legal concept of conspiracy in the context of pre-war decisions by Japanese officials. He also maintained that the tribunal should not retrospectively apply (\"nulla poena sine lege\") the new concept of Class A war crimes – waging aggressive (also known as crimes against peace) – and crimes against humanity (that had already been used \"ex post facto\" at the Nuremberg Trials). Hence Pal dissented from the tribunal's verdicts of guilt in the cases of defendants charged with Class A war crimes. His reasoning also influenced the judges representing the Netherlands and France, and all three of these judges issued dissenting opinions. However, under the rules of the tribunal, all verdicts and sentences were decided by a majority of the presiding judges.\n\nPal was the father of nine daughters (Shanti Rani, Asha Rani, Leela Rani, Bela Rani, Nilima, Roma Rani, Renu Kana, Lakshmi Rani and Smriti Kana) and five sons (Prasanta Kumar, Pradyot Kumar, Pronab Kumar, Pratip Bijoy and Pratul Kumar). One son, Pronab Kumar Pal, also became a lawyer (a barrister), as did his two sons-in-law, Balai Lal Pal (with whom he co-authored a book ) and Debi Prasad Pal (who also served as a judge of the Calcutta High Court and Indian Minister of State for Finance).\n\nWhile finding that 'the evidence is still overwhelming that atrocities were perpetrated by the members of the Japanese armed forces against the civilian population of some of the territories occupied by them as also against the prisoners of war', he produced a judgment questioning the legitimacy of the tribunal and its rulings. He held the view that the legitimacy of the tribunal was suspect and questionable, because the spirit of retribution, and not impartial justice, was the underlying criterion for passing the judgment.\n\nHe concluded:\nJudge Pal never intended to offer a juridical argument on whether a sentence of not guilty would have been a correct one. However, he argued that the United States had clearly provoked the war with Japan and expected Japan to act. He argued that \"Even contemporary historians could think that 'as for the present war, the Principality of Monaco, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, would have taken up arms against the United States on receipt of such a note (Hull note) as the State Department sent the Japanese Government on the eve of Pearl Harbor.'\" He also noted that \"Questions of law are not decided in an intellectual quarantine area in which legal doctrine and the local history of the dispute alone are retained and all else is forcibly excluded. We cannot afford to be ignorant of the world in which disputes arise.\n\nIn his lone dissent, Judge Pal refers to the trial as a \"sham employment of legal process for the satisfaction of a thirst for revenge.\" According to Norimitsu Onishi, while he fully acknowledged Japan's war atrocities – including the Nanjing massacre – he said they were covered in the Class B and Class C trials. Judge Pal noted, \"I might mention in this connection that even the published accounts of Nanking 'rape' could not be accepted by the world without some suspicion of exaggeration...\"\n\nFurthermore, he believed that the exclusion of Western colonialism and the use of the atom bomb by the United States from the list of crimes, as well as the exclusion of judges from the vanquished nations on the bench, signified the \"failure of the Tribunal to provide anything other than the opportunity for the victors to retaliate.\" Pal wrote that the Tokyo Trials were an exercise in victor's justice and that the Allies were equally culpable in acts such as strategic bombings of civilian targets. Regardless of his personal opinions about Japan, he deemed it appropriate to dissent from the judgement of his \"learned brothers\" to embody his love for absolute truth and justice. In this he was not alone among Indian jurists of the time; one prominent Calcutta barrister wrote that the Tribunal was little more than \"a sword in a wig\". In general, fear of American nuclear power was an international phenomenon following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe American occupation of Japan ended in 1952, after Tokyo signed the San Francisco Peace Treaty and accepted the Tokyo trials' verdict. The end of the occupation also lifted a ban on the publication of Judge Pal's 1,235-page dissent, which Japanese patriots used as the basis of their argument that the Tokyo trials were biased. In academic context, it has since generally been argued that the underlying aim of the trials was to shift blame from the Emperor to Tojo as the culprit of the war.\n\nPsychologist and cultural critic Ashis Nandy argued that Judge Pal's lone dissenting opinion, that the Japanese soldiers were only following orders and that the acts committed by them weren't illegal in an indictable sense, was because of \"his long exposure to the traditional laws of India,\" combined with a sense of \"Asian solidarity\" within the \"larger Afro-Asian context of nationalism.\"\n\nIn 1966, Pal visited Japan and said in a speech that he had admired Japan from an early age for being the only Asian nation that \"stood up against the West\". The Emperor of Japan conferred upon Pal the First Class of the Order of the Sacred Treasure. Pal is revered by Japanese patriots and a monument dedicated to him stands on the grounds of the Yasukuni Shrine. The monument was erected after Pal's death.\n\nJudge Pal's dissent is frequently mentioned by Indian diplomats and political leaders in the context of Indo-Japanese friendship and solidarity. For example, on 29 April 2005 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh referred to it as follows, in his remarks at a banquet in New Delhi in honour of the visiting Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi:\nOn 14 December 2006, Singh made a speech in the Japanese Diet. He stated:\nOn 23 August 2007, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe met with Pal's son, Prasanta, in Kolkata, during his day-long visit to the city. Prasanta Pal, now an octogenarian, presented prime minister Abe with four photographs of his father, of which two photographs were of Radhabinod Pal with Abe's grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. They chatted for half an hour at a city hotel. \n\nIn the 2016 miniseries \"Tokyo Trial\", Pal is portrayed by Indian actor Irrfan Khan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1817355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817355", "title": "John C. Waldron", "text": "John C. Waldron\n\nJohn Charles Waldron (August 24, 1900 – June 4, 1942) was a United States Navy aviator who led a squadron of torpedo bombers in World War II. He and twenty-nine of the thirty men of his squadron perished in the Battle of Midway.\n\nWaldron was born on August 24, 1900 at Fort Pierre, South Dakota, son of rancher Charles Westbrook Waldron and Jane Van Metre grandson of lawyer and probate Judge George Prentiss Waldron, and a sixth great nephew of Richard Waldron. He was of colonial New Hampshire families on his father's side, and of Oglala Lakota and Southerner background on his mother's side.. His family immigrated to Canada when he was a child and homesteaded near Lashburn, Saskatchewan where he spent his youth before returning to the USA. In the midst of his armed forces career he married Adelaide Wentworth and had two daughters. He studied law and was admitted to the bar, but never practiced. World War II Navy Commander George Philip Jr., a Navy Cross recipient and namesake of , was the son of Waldron's sister Alice Island Waldron.\n\nHe received an appointment as midshipman from his home state on June 16, 1920 and graduated with the United States Naval Academy Class of 1924. Following his initial sea duty aboard \"Seattle\" (CA-11), Waldron went to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, where he received his wings in the summer of 1927. Over the ensuing months, Waldron flew with torpedo squadrons (VT-1S and VT-9S and received his promotion to lieutenant, junior grade, on February 16, 1928. He served at the Naval Academy from May 24 to September 13, 1929, where he instructed midshipmen in the field of aviation. Then, after duty as an instructor at the NAS Pensacola, between October 1929 and June 1931, Waldron went to sea again, this time with Scouting Squadron 3B (VS-3B), based aboard \"Lexington\" (CV-2), reporting for duty on July 1, 1931.\n\nWaldron flew observation aircraft off \"Colorado\" (BB-45), before he joined Patrol Squadron 1B (VP-1B), Battle Force, for a brief period in late 1936. Subsequently flying from \"Saratoga\" (CV-3) with Fighting Squadron 3 (VF-3) until the early summer of 1939, he reported back to NAS Pensacola, for further instructor's duty on June 27, 1939. Waldron then served three successive tours of shore duty, all involving flying, at the Naval Proving Ground, Dahlgren, Va.; the Bureau of Ordnance, Washington, D.C.; and finally in the 3rd Naval District, where he was appointed naval inspector of ordnance at the plant of Carl L. Norden, Inc., in New York City—makers of the famed Norden bombsight. Detached from that duty in the summer of 1941, Lieutenant Commmader Waldron took command of the newly formed Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8), part of the embryonic air group being assembled for the new fleet carrier \"Hornet\" (CV-8) at Newport News, Virginia. The Pearl Harbor attack, though, meant that his training of his men had to be intensive.\n\n\"Torpedo 8\" did not get a chance to practice its trade, however, until nearly 10 months after it had been commissioned at Norfolk. Too late to take part in the Battle of the Coral Sea, VT-8 would receive its brutal baptism of fire at the turning point of the Pacific War—the Battle of Midway. In the days preceding that battle, VT-8 led a relaxed existence on board the carrier as she steamed toward \"Point Luck\" from Pearl Harbor in the first few days of June 1942. Finally, on the eve of battle, Commander Waldron called his men together and distributed a mimeographed plan of attack. He concluded by saying that if worst came to worst, he wanted each man to do his utmost to destroy the enemy. \"If there is only one plane left to make a final run-in,\" he told his men, \"I want that man to go in and get a hit. May God be with us all. Good luck, happy landings, and give 'em hell.\"\n\nThe next day, June 4, the 15 Douglas TBD-1 Devastators of VT-8 launched from \"Hornet\"'s flight deck in search of the enemy. Before takeoff, LCDR Waldron had a dispute with the Hornet's Commander, Air Group, Stanhope C. Ring, and \"Hornet\" CO Marc Mitscher about where the Japanese carriers would be found. Despite having a contact report showing the Japanese southwest of \"Hornet\", Mitscher and Ring ordered the flight to take a course due west, in the hopes of spotting a possible trailing group of carriers. Waldron argued for a course based on the contact report, but was overruled. Once in the air, Waldron attempted to take control of the \"Hornet\" strike group by radio. Failing that, he soon split his squadron off and led his unit directly to the Japanese carrier group. Waldron, leading the first carrier planes to approach the Japanese carriers (somewhat after 9:00AM local time, over an hour before the American dive bombers would arrive), was grimly aware of the lack of fighter protection, but true to his plan of attack committed Torpedo 8 to battle. Without fighter escort, underpowered, with limited defensive armament, and forced by the unreliability of their own torpedoes to fly low and slow directly at their targets, the \"Hornet\" torpedo planes received the undivided attention of the enemy's combat air patrol of Mitsubishi Zero fighters. All 15 planes were shot down. Of the 30 men who set out that morning, only one—Ensign George H. Gay, Jr., USNR—survived. Their sacrifice, however, had not been in vain. Torpedo 8 had forced the Japanese carriers to maneuver radically, delaying the launching of the planned strike against the American carriers. After further separate attacks by the remaining two torpedo squadrons over the next hour, Japanese fighter cover and air defense coordination had become focused on low-altitude defense. This left the Japanese carriers exposed to the late-arriving SBD Dauntless dive bombers from and , which attacked from high altitude. The dive bombers fatally damaged three of the four Japanese carriers, changing the course of the battle.\n\nTorpedo 8 earned the Presidential Unit Citation (US); Lieutenant Commander Waldron received the Navy Cross posthumously, as well as a share of the unit citation. Waldron's role at Midway was portrayed by actor Glenn Corbett in the 1976 film \"Midway\".\n\nThe USS \"Waldron\" (DD-699), an \"Allen M. Sumner\"-class destroyer, was named in his honor.\n\nNaval Auxiliary Air Station Waldron Field, part of the NAS Corpus Christi, Texas complex, was named in his honor. Closed in the 1950s, NAAS Waldron Field was later reactivated in the early 1960s as an outlying field renamed OLF Waldron Field in support of Student Naval Aviator primary flight training operations at NAS Corpus Christi, a role it continues to have today.\n\nCamp Waldron of the Farragut Naval Training Station on Lake Pend Oreille in northern Idaho was named in honor of LtCdr Waldron. The camp, designed to house and train 5,000 naval recruits at a time, opened on 8 November 1942.\n\nJohn C.

This element of the act was implemented in stages as conclusive maps of different regions were produced.

The three main changes are: the maximum penalty is now a term of imprisonment instead of a fine; the Secretary of State can designate \"wildlife inspectors\" who have a range of powers under the Act; offences of disturbing certain birds and animals are extended so as to cover reckless as well as intentional acts.\n\nThe act gave power to create local access forums (commonly referred to as 'LAFs'), comprising a balance of user, landowner and other interests, to give advice on development of access land and of the path network; the policy of footpath improvement would be set out in a Rights of Way Improvement Plan (RoWIP).\n\nA more ambitious Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 was enacted by the Scottish Parliament which formalised the Scottish tradition of unhindered access to open countryside, provided that care is taken not to cause damage or interfere with activities including farming and game stalking.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1817382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817382", "title": "Richardson Dilworth", "text": "Richardson Dilworth\n\nRichardson K. Dilworth (August 29, 1898 – January 23, 1974) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as the 117th mayor of Philadelphia from 1956 to 1962. He twice ran as the Democratic nominee for governor of Pennsylvania, in 1950 and in 1962.\n\nHe was born in Pittsburgh to Joseph Richardson Dilworth and Annie Hunter (Wood) Dilworth. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in World War I and was commissioned as an officer in World War II. In 1938, he joined the law firm of Dilworth Paxson. In 1921 he graduated from Yale University, where he was a member of Scroll and Key and Delta Kappa Epsilon, and lettered for the varsity football team. In 1926 he graduated from Yale Law School, afterwards becoming an attorney in Philadelphia. On August 6, 1935, he married Ann Elizabeth Kaufman. They had a daughter, Deborah, and a son, Richardson Jr.\n\nDilworth had grown up as a Republican, but became a Democrat out of frustration with the city's longstanding Republican machine. Along with Joe Clark and others, he was at the forefront of a post-World War II reform movement in Philadelphia that led to the adoption of a modern city charter that consolidated city and county offices and introduced civil service examinations on a broad scale to replace much of the existing patronage system.\n\nDilworth initially ran for mayor in 1947 against incumbent Republican Barney Samuel. Samuel was seeking his second full term in office, after assuming office following the death of Robert Lamberton in 1941. Dilworth was ultimately defeated by over 90,000 votes; however, the election marked the last time, to date, that a Republican was elected mayor of Philadelphia. In 1949, Dilworth was elected city treasurer, while Clark was elected city controller. Dilworth ran for governor in the 1950 election, losing a close race to John Fine. In 1951, he was elected Philadelphia District Attorney, while Clark was elected mayor. Clark and Dilworth's inaugurations ended a 67-year period of uninterrupted Republican control of the city (and instituted a period of uninterrupted Democratic control which has persisted past 2017). In 1955, Dilworth was elected mayor, defeating Thacher Longstreth.\n\nDuring their tenures as mayor, Clark and Dilworth introduced a variety of reforms and innovations. Among these was extensive high-rise public housing which would, a generation later, be condemned by many as a breeding ground for poverty and crime. However, they also greatly strengthened the city planning function of Philadelphia city government. Both retained Edmund Bacon as executive director of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission, and the Clark-Dilworth era is recognized as a high-water mark for planning, during which the decline of Center City Philadelphia as a commercial and residential center was reversed and priority was given (particularly during Dilworth's administration) to saving the city's historic and irreplaceable Society Hill district. Dilworth resigned as mayor on February 12, 1962, to launch a second bid for governor.\n\nDespite President John F. Kennedy's work on his behalf, Dilworth lost the fall general election by a half million votes to progressive Republican Congressman Bill Scranton, in what scholars considered \"one of the bitterest [campaigns] in Pennsylvania history.\" Scranton had run for governor (with fellow progressive Raymond P. Shafer for lieutenant governor) after a deeply divisive Republican primary involving Philadelphia Republican boss Billy Meehan's candidate, Judge Robert E. Woodside; and five other candidates. Republicans also carried both houses of the state legislature in that landslide election.\n\nWith his wife, Ann Dilworth, he was a passenger on the SS \"Andrea Doria\", an ocean liner that collided with the MS \"Stockholm\" near Nantucket, Massachusetts, on July 25, 1956, and subsequently sank. They were saved, and Dilworth was on board the last lifeboat that was picked up by the SS \"Île de France\".\n\nFollowing his tenure as mayor, Dilworth served as partner in the Philadelphia-based law firm of Dilworth Paxson LLP, which bears his name. He also served as president of the Philadelphia School Board, and in 1971 was appointed one of two bankruptcy trustees (along with Andrew Lewis) for the Reading Company, a railroad company headquartered in Philadelphia.\n\nDilworth Park, adjacent to Philadelphia City Hall, is named in his honor.\n\n"}

Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design at the University of Toronto (U of T) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The building is situated in the centre of a roundabout of Spadina Avenue, north of College Street. Its location provides a picturesque vista looking north up Spadina Avenue; it is an axial view terminus for Spadina Avenue.\n\nThe Gothic Revival building was originally built in 1875 and designed by architect James Avon Smith . \n\nThe parcel of land now known as Spadina Crescent first appeared on maps of Toronto as early as 1835, originally named \"Mansfield's Old Gardens\" and then Crescent Garden. The land was originally laid out by Dr. William Baldwin to cut through his families land holdings . There was the intention for the city to turn it into a park after Dr. Baldwin's death, however the conditions for this were never met and his grandchildren sold the land in 1873 to the hon. J. McMurrich of the Presbyterian Church for $10,000.\n\nThe building became the home of Knox College, a theological college of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. Knox College became affiliated with the University of Toronto in 1887, and in 1914 moved to its current location on the west side of King's College Circle. During World War I, the building became barracks, and shortly afterward became the Spadina Military Hospital in October 1916 . For a period in 1918, Amelia Earhart worked as a nurses aide at the hospital. It remained a veterans hospital until 1943 when it was acquired by the University of Toronto's Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, which became one of Canada's main centers for the development and manufacture of pharmaceuticals. The building was in disrepair at this point and needed substantial renovations. It was also around this time that the basement was excavated. In the 1960s, it was proposed that this building be demolished to make way for the Spadina Expressway, which was never built. It became an academic building again in 1972 with the sale and relocation of the laboratories. The building was home to the Ontario division of the Eye Bank of Canada, and an alternative U of T student weekly newspaper, \"The Newspaper\" which moved because of renovations.\n\nIn June 2013, U of T announced a significant overhaul and renovation of the building, with plans to make it the new home for the Daniels Faculty of Architecture. On December 4, 2015, the \"Toronto Star\" published a video by Christopher Hume, its architecture critic, celebrating the building's history, and the University's plan to renovate, update and expand the building. The building was subsequently restored and renovated by a team of architects including heritage architects ERA and design architects Nader Tehrani and Katherine Faulkner of the Boston based firm NADAAA. The expansion, which was completed in 2017, included a new contemporary glass, concrete, and steel addition to the north side. The expanded portion of the building now offers space for design studios, lounges, a student cafe, workshop and fabrication labs. The historic building was sensitively restored and renovated to accommodate the new library, classes, and faculty offices. Toronto based landscape architecture studio PUBLIC WORK designed the surrounding landscape, which includes native plants and trees such as birch and oak. On the north side are two large berms, a grassy area, and a stepped pathway which leads to the fabrication laboratory. The extensive project received several awards for architectural excellence and was published in magazines around the globe.\n\nFormerly the site of the Knox College courtyard, The Main Hall is a double-height lecture hall with bleacher-style seating for lectures, performances, and events of up to 400 people. The hall is at the heart of building, accessible via both the historic part of the building at the south side, and viathe new east-west internal \"street\"/corridor in the new building. In 2018, the hall hosted Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Balkrishna Doshi's public lecture about his work and the prize. The hall is adorned with colourful painted plywood walls that add a sense of energy and movement to the space. Above, “a triangular section of stepped seating, like an open stair outside the volume between the second and third floors, overlooks the hall and simultaneously connects to the design studio for graduate students at the top.”\n\nThe third floor graduate design studio is known for it’s expansive “column-free” space that extends across the entire North side of the building and offers views of the city through a glazed curtain wall. NADAAA architects used gypsum boards to design a dramatic “bow-tie” ceiling made of four scissor trusses and clerestory ceiling openings that bring in natural light. Architect Nader Tehrani was inspired by the Firth of Forth Bridge in Scotland.\n\nThe fabrication lab is a double-height workshop and digital laboratory which “offers a variety of computationally controlled technologies, including large 3-axis and 4-axis routers, a fused deposition modelling rapid-prototyping system, a waterjet cutter, a colour 3D printer, a 3D digitizer, a 3D laser scanner, several laser cutters, and a large format vacuum former.” The array of digital tools allow students at the faculty to produce models and various structural elements in wood and metals. The lab is viewable to students and visitors at the building from the east-west “street” that runs through the centre of the building. Double-height garage style doors open to a landscaped courtyard. Adjacent to the lab is the Daniels construction workshop which includes a full metal and woodworking shop, an assembly space, spray booth, and a large array of materials and tools.\n\nThe Eberhard Zeidler Library is located in the historic part of the building, on the west side of the first floor. The library is named after architect and Zeidler Partnership founder Eberhard Zeidler. The library offers an extensive collection of books on architecture, landscape architecture, art, and urban design.\n\nThe Architecture and Design Gallery is an experimental public gallery dedicated to showcasing and advocating for the important ways that design shapes our cities, landscapes, and daily lives. Located in the lower level of the building, it was renovated from a \"concrete shell\" into a 7,500 s.f. exhibition venue after the new building opened in 2017. The space launched on November 9, 2019, with the opening of the inaugural installation New Circadia. The gallery is supported by the Estate of James Drewry Stewart and the Government of Canada\".\"\n\nArchitecture Masterprize Education Award, 2019\n\nArchitecture Masterprize Green Award, 2019\n\nArchitectural Conservancy Ontario, Paul Oberman Award for Adaptive Re-use, 2019\n\nToronto Urban Design Awards, Award of Excellence, 2019\n\nHeritage Toronto Awards, William Greer Built Heritage Award, 2019\n\nSCUP/AIA-CAE Excellence in Architecture for Building Additions or Adaptive Reuse Honor Award, 2019\n\nCOTE Top 10, American Institute of Architects, 2019\n\nAIA Education Facilities National Award of Excellence, 2019\n\nCanadian Society of Landscape Architects National Award, 2019\n\nLt.

L. 109-9, 119 Stat. 218 (April 27, 2005), is a federal legislative act regarding copyright that became law in the United States in 2005. The Act consists of two subparts: the Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005, which increases penalties for copyright infringement, and the Family Home Movie Act of 2005, which permits the development of technology to \"sanitize\" potentially offensive DVD and VOD content. \n\nThe Family Entertainment and Copyright Act was introduced into the United States Senate (of the 109th United States Congress) on January 25, 2005 by Senator Orrin Hatch (R - Utah), and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on April 27, 2005.\n\nThe act provides theater owners and employees with both civil and criminal immunity for questioning suspected violators or detaining them while police are summoned.\n\nThis act, also known as the \"ART Act\", is targeted at preventing copyright infringement of movies and software. It specifically targets two activities: filming movies in a movie theater, and early release of movies and software before they become publicly available.\n\nIt permits preregistration of certain types of unpublished works if it determines that such works have a history of infringement prior to commercial distribution. The purpose of preregistration is related to potential litigation protection in view of the fact that it allows an infringement action to be brought before the authorized commercial distribution of a work and the work’s full-fledged registration. Preregistration makes possible—only upon full registration—for the copyright owner to receive statutory damages and attorneys’ fees in an infringement action. Works determined eligible for copyright preregistration are: motion pictures, sound recordings, musical compositions, literary works being prepared as books, computer programs (including videogames), and advertising or marketing photographs.\n\nAnyone who \"knowingly uses or attempts to use an audiovisual recording device to transmit or make a copy of a ... protected work... from a performance of such work in a motion picture exhibition facility...\" may be imprisoned up to three years for a first time offender, and up to six years for a repeat offender, in addition to any fines that may be levied under the U.S. Criminal Code for copyright infringement. This could apply to merely taking a cell phone snapshot of a theatre screen.\n\nWith regard to unreleased works intended for public distribution (e.g., beta software or workprints), anyone who makes available a work that the copyright owner expects to distribute commercially, but is not yet distributed, shall be punished if the work is \"made available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution.\" First time offenders can get up to three years in jail, or five if they committed the offense for financial gain. Repeat offenders can get ten years if the offense was committed for financial gain. These penalties are in addition to any penalties for violating non-disclosure agreements or trade secret law.\n\nThis section is an exemption of liability allowing the creation of technology that can edit a DVD or transmitted movie on the fly (during playback) and thus present a censored version of that movie. This provision arose out of a lawsuit between \"ClearPlay\", a Salt Lake City-based company that markets DVD-sanitizing technology, and a number of Hollywood studios and directors. The ClearPlay technology allows a home consumer to screen out up to 14 different categories of objectionable content, such as drug use, sexual situations, or foul language. The act is codified in 17 U.S.C. 110(11)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1817391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817391", "title": "New Gate", "text": "New Gate\n\nThe New Gate ( \"Bāb ij-Jdïd\") ( \"HaSha'ar HeChadash\") is the newest one of the Gates of the Old City of Jerusalem. It was built in 1889 to provide direct access between the Christian Quarter and the new neighborhoods then going up outside the walls. The arched gate is decorated with crenelated stonework. The New Gate was built at the highest point of the present wall, at above sea level.\n\nThe \"New Gate\" was the name used by the Ottoman administration. It was also known as \"Bab es Sultan Abd ul Hamid\" by the Arab workforce for the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II who allowed the building. It should not be confused with the \"New Gate\" of the Second Temple complex mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah (26:10; 36:10) that served as entrance to the Great Sanhedrin's Hall of Hewn Stones, and was previously called the Benjamin Gate.\n\nDuring the 3rd and 4th centuries the northern wall was rebuilt and improved by the Byzantines leaving no trace or record of a gate in this sector of the fortification. While there is no information about a gate preexisting at this point in the wall before the city was occupied by the Crusaders, there is a suggestion that they maintained a small postern gate, named after St. Lazarus, just east of the Ottoman construction for the use of troops stationed at Tancred's Tower (Goliath's Tower). Uncovered during drainage and sewage works in the area, it may have also been used by the knights of the Leper's Order also quartered there. Early records of the Crusades suggest the wall was breached after the Crusader occupation on the orders of Tancred The gate may well have been, with the tower subsequently named after him. The breach may have been later converted into a gate.\n\nThe Crusader gate may have been sealed up following Saladin's capture of Jerusalem in 1187 because it did not conform to architectural style of fortifications used by the Turkish armies. The earlier Crusader gate had \"...a roundabout entrance, dim approaches, and a tower that protruded from the line of fortifications.\" By contrast the earlier gates as well as the Ottoman gate are constructed within the city, and aligned with the facade of the wall.\nThe older gates were probably sealed by the external wall built in 1516 by Suleyman the Magnificent. However, another gate was reported in the 16th century called \"the New Gate of the Serbian Monastery\", that was used by the Franciscans while they were building the Church of St. Salvatore.\n\nIt was built at the request of the French Consul to provide access to the Old City from the Notre Dame Hospice that was completed in 1886, and to provide Russian Christian pilgrims living at the Russian Compound (outside the Old City walls) direct access to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Christian Quarter. Contrary to popular belief, Kaiser Wilhelm II during his visit to Jerusalem entered not through the New Gate, but through the \"Hole in the Wall\", made so that he wouldn't have to dismount his carriage to enter the city.\n\nFrom the beginning of the First World War the headquarters of Roshen Bey, the most senior Ottoman military officer in the Jerusalem area, was located at the Notre Dame Hospice opposite the New Gate.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s the New Gate became the nearest gate to the modern city Jerusalem with the Christian Brothers' College located just inside its structure in the Old City. At this time the New Gate, as all gates to the Old City, included an iron gate which was operated by the police, and shut as required by the administrative regulations. On the afternoon of Friday, 23 August 1929, an unprovoked attack was staged by the Arabs from the Old City between the New and Damascus gates that resulted in the killing of several Jews after the Arabs were inflamed by the sermons during the noon prayers at \"Haram esh Sherif\". From 1946 and until Independence the British Administration created a security zone between the New Gate and Jaffa Road, called euphemistically \"Bevingrad\" for Ernest Bevin, due to the terrorist activity from both sides. On November 15, 1945 the Stern Gang attempted to demolish part of the wall next to the New Gate, using a massive device that required ten men to transport and emplace; however it failed to function.\nDuring the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, David Shaltiel's Etzioni Brigade (Hagana) failed to capture East Jerusalem from the local Arab defenders reinforced by a company of the Arab Legion's 6th battalion during Operation Kedem. This occurred not because of Arab offensive action, which was restrained by orders of John Bagot Glubb, but because the Jewish demolition charge intended for the iron gate was detonated by a stray artillery shell that set the Arab wooden barricade in front of the New Gate on fire, halting the Stern Gang, Hagana and Irgun troops' advance just prior to the ceasefire announcement. Subsequently the Jordanian occupation administration had the gate sealed off. It was reopened again by the Israeli Army in 1967 following the capture of East Jerusalem during the Jordanian campaign.\nThe gate itself is maintained under the preservation orders, supervised by the Israel Antiquities Authority. The land around the New Gate is largely owned by the Latin Patriarchate and the Franciscan Order, which have refused to sell it to the Israeli government. It required many years to lease land from the Patriarchate between the New Gate and the Damascus Gate for a park.\nIn the current urban layout of Jerusalem the New Gate provides the quickest route from the Old City to West Jerusalem, including via Egged No.1 & 2 buses, via its HaSha'ar HaKhadash road.\n\n\"Notre Dame de France\" is a Catholic monastery and guesthouse located across from the New Gate on Ha-Tsanchanim Road (The Paratroopers Road). Other notable buildings near the New Gate are the College des Frères (for boys), St.Basilius Church, Custodia di Terra Santa church, St. Salvador church, and the St.Louis Hospital, located outside the wall.\n"}
{"id": "1817392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817392", "title": "Clitellum", "text": "Clitellum\n\nThe clitellum is a thickened glandular and non-segmented section of the body wall near the head in earthworms and leeches, that secretes a viscid sac in which eggs are stored. It is located near the anterior end of the body, between the fourteenth and seventeenth segments. The number of the segments to where the clitellum begins and the number of segments that make up the clitellum are important for identifying earthworms.\n\nThe clitellum is part of the reproductive system of clitellates, a subgroup of annelids which contains oligochaetes (earthworms) and hirudineans (leeches). The clitellum is a thick, saddle-like ring found in the epidermis (skin) of the worm, usually with a light-colored pigment. To form a cocoon for its eggs, the clitellum secretes a viscous fluid. This organ is used in sexual reproduction of some annelids.\n\nIn earthworms, the clitellum can only be seen when the worm is sexually mature. It may be white, orange-red or reddish-brown in colour. Earthworms are ready to mate when their clitellum is orange. In leeches, the clitellum appears seasonally. Its color is usually slightly lighter than that of the body of the annelid. Occasionally, living segments of the worm will be shed with the clitellum.\n\n"}
{"id": "1817393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817393", "title": "Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)", "text": "Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)\n\nFort Loudoun was a British colonial-era fort located in what is now Monroe County, Tennessee, United States. Built in 1756 and 1757 to help garner Cherokee support for the British at the outset of the Seven Years' War, the fort was one of the first significant British outposts west of the Appalachian Mountains. The fort was designed by John William G. De Brahm, its construction was supervised by Captain Raymond Demeré, and its garrison was commanded by Demeré's brother, Paul Demeré. It was named for the Earl of Loudoun, the commander of British forces in North America at the time.\n\nRelations between the garrison of Fort Loudoun and the local Cherokee inhabitants were initially cordial, but soured in 1758 due to hostilities between Cherokee fighters and European settlers in Virginia and South Carolina. After the massacre of several Cherokee chiefs who were being held hostage at Fort Prince George, the Cherokee laid siege to Fort Loudoun in March 1760. The fort's garrison held out for several months, but diminishing supplies forced its surrender in August 1760. Hostile Cherokees attacked the fort's garrison as it marched back to South Carolina, killing more than two dozen and taking most of the survivors prisoner.\n\nThe fall of Fort Loudoun led to an invasion of Cherokee territory by General James Grant and an important peace expedition to the Overhill country by Henry Timberlake. The fort was reconstructed in the 20th century based on the detailed descriptions of its design by De Brahm and Demeré, and excavations conducted by the Works Progress Administration, the Fort Loudoun Association, and the Tennessee Division of Archaeology. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965, and is now the focus of Fort Loudoun State Park.\n\nAs early as 1708, British officials had discussed building a fort in Cherokee territory. The British colony of South Carolina considered trade with the Cherokee crucial, but had struggled to regulate it due to the remoteness of most Cherokee towns. English traders frequently exploited the Cherokee, generating considerable resentment for the English among Cherokee leaders. The presence of a fort would be one means of regulating this trade.\n\nSupport for the fort increased considerably with the appointment of James Glen as South Carolina's governor in 1743. Glen believed such a fort would not only help regulate trade, but would be a stepping stone for expanding the British Empire into the interior of the continent. The fort had some support among British officials, as it was the height of King George's War (1744–1748), and the French were threatening to expand into the area from their base at Fort Toulouse (in modern central Alabama). While the Cherokee were initially cold to the idea, the Overhill Cherokee (i.e., the Cherokees living on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains, in what is now Tennessee), who had been suffering attacks from French-backed rival tribes, invited South Carolina to build the fort in 1747. Support for the fort faded at the end of the war, however.\n\nThe outbreak of the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War) in 1754 brought revived interest in the construction of a fort. While the Cherokee were allies of the British, French influence within the tribe had grown considerably, and a faction of the tribe at Great Tellico had switched its support to the French. The British Crown provided Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia with funds for the construction of a fort, though Dinwiddie gave an insignificant amount to Governor Glen for the fort, and spent most of the remainder on Braddock's Expedition in 1755. After this expedition ended in disaster, Dinwiddie turned to the Cherokee for assistance in defending Virginia's frontier. The Cherokee agreed to provide 600 warriors, and in return, Virginia and South Carolina would construct a fort to protect Cherokee families while the men were away fighting.\n\nThe fort was to be a joint effort by Virginia and South Carolina. The party from South Carolina was hampered by bureaucratic delays, however, and the Virginians, led by Major Andrew Lewis, arrived at the Cherokee town of Chota in the Little Tennessee Valley on June 28, 1756, several weeks ahead of the South Carolinians. Rather than wait for the South Carolinians, Lewis's party began work on a fort across the river from Chota. This structure, known as the \"Virginia Fort,\" was square in shape, measuring on each side, with walls consisting of earthen embankments topped by a palisade. Lewis's orders were to merely construct the fort, not garrison it, so when it was completed in early August 1756, the Virginians returned home.\n\nAlthough Governor Glen's political foes had him ousted in May 1756, his successor, William Henry Lyttelton, was committed to the fort's completion. An advance party led by William Gibbs crossed the mountains and arrived at Great Hiwassee in early August, and had reached Tomotley on August 6, 1756, where Gibbs stayed in the home of Cherokee leader Attakullakulla. The main body, consisting of 80 British regulars commanded by Captain Raymond Demeré and two provincial companies of 60 men each, departed from Fort Prince George on the South Carolina frontier on September 21, 1756. Accompanied by 60 pack horses, the group made the roughly trek in ten days, arriving in Tomotley on October 1. They were greeted by the Cherokee leader Old Hop and 200 Indians. The herculean task of moving the fort's cannons over the mountains was accomplished by a contractor named John Elliott. John Stuart, an officer and future Indian agent who had accompanied the garrison, negotiated a purchase of corn from the Cherokee that helped the garrison avoid starvation.\n\nJohn William Gerard de Brahm, a German-born engineer who had overseen the repair of the fortifications of Charleston, was tasked with designing the fort. De Brahm and Demeré constantly bickered over the fort's location and design. Demeré favored a site selected earlier that year by a scout named John Pearson, but De Brahm rejected the site as too exposed. He favored a site further upstream that offered a commanding view of the river, but Demeré disagreed, saying the site lacked suitable land for the garrison to grow crops. Demeré reported that De Brahm, incensed, took out his pistol and offered it to Demeré to shoot him in the head. The two eventually agreed on the current site of the fort as a compromise.\n\nConstruction of the fort began on October 5, 1756. De Brahm's design was more elaborate than a typical frontier fort. The fort was diamond-shaped with bastions at the corners, each of which contained three cannons. As the fort was built on a hill slope, two of the bastions were atop the hill, and two were closer to the bottom, with the walls sloping downward. The bastions were named for the King of England, the Queen of England, the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of Cumberland. The walls were in length, and surrounded by a ditch, a yard deep and wide, which was planted with a honey locust hedge.\n\nThroughout November and December 1756, Demeré and De Brahm continued to squabble over the fort's design. Demeré disliked De Brahm's original design for outer and inner palisades, and thought De Brahm's plans for two smaller auxiliary fortresses near the river were too complex. The two also disagreed on whether or not to discharge the provincials, with De Brahm arguing the construction work was nearly complete and the provincials no longer needed, and Demeré disagreeing, stating the fort was still uninhabitable. On December 24, 1756, De Brahm, stating the fort was essentially finished, abruptly left for South Carolina, drawing a strong rebuke from Demeré. The nonplussed Cherokees referred to De Brahm as \"the warrior who ran away in the night.\"\n\nAfter De Brahm's departure, Demeré abandoned the original palisade design in favor of a single, more permanent palisade. The walls of the palisade consisted of upright logs, of which extended from the ground at a 15-degree angle. The interior of the fort covered approximately , and included a powder magazine, a blacksmith shop, barracks and officers' quarters, and supply buildings. The garrison built drains, troughs for salting beef, a meathouse, and a charcoal pit for the blacksmith. The walls and bastions were completed by March 26, 1757. Demeré reported the fort completed on May 30, 1757. Governor Lyttelton named the fort after John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun, who had recently been appointed commander-in-chief of British forces in North America.\n\nAfter reporting the fort completed, Demeré requested a replacement, stating he had fallen ill. On August 6, 1757, his brother, Paul Demeré, arrived to relieve him, accompanied by reinforcements. By November 1757, the garrison had completed a guardhouse and several storage buildings. A personal house for Demeré was completed by early 1758, and the fort's well was completed by June 1758. During the same period, the garrison planted of crops.\n\nLife at the fort was generally routine. A changing of the guard took place several times per day. At night, five large guard dogs roamed the fort's exterior. The fort's blacksmith spent much of his time mending Cherokee guns and tools. The garrison provided most of its own food through hunting, fishing and farming, though some food was acquired from the Cherokees (some soldiers had Cherokee wives). Sixty women and children, dependents of the soldiers, lived in the fort.\n\nIn June 1757, a 36-man contingent of the garrison, led by Lieutenant James Adamson and Ensign Richard Coytmore, attacked a band of hostile Indians who were threatening the Cherokee at Great Tellico. Three of the intruders were killed, and the rest were driven out. In September 1757, Paul Demeré attended the Cherokees' Green Corn Dance, and spent the subsequent months encouraging the Cherokee to launch attacks against the French and their Indian allies. He convinced a number of Cherokees, including Attakullakulla, to join the Forbes Expedition against Fort Duquesne in 1758 (Attakullakulla would eventually abandon the expedition in disgust over Forbes' delays).\n\nWilliam Richardson, a Presbyterian missionary (and uncle of future North Carolina governor William Richardson Davie), arrived at Fort Loudoun in late 1758. He baptized a child of one of the soldiers, and delivered sermons on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. He reported the Little Tennessee River had frozen over on December 19, and noted a persistent rumor of an impending French attack. Richardson stated the Cherokees were heavy drinkers who were uninterested in his message about the Gospel. Frustrated, he left the fort on February 6, 1759.\n\nRelations between the Cherokee and the English began to decline in late 1758. During the Forbes Expedition, a group of Cherokee warriors, who had been tasked with fighting those northern Indians who were allied with the French, scalped and killed one or more white settlers, and then attempted to parade the scalps before the British, deceptively claiming they belonged to their enemies in order to receive a reward from the British. Suspicious, the British soldiers disarmed Attakullakulla and other warriors, none of whom had been involved, and briefly detained them. Although Governor Fauquier of Virginia managed to placate Attakullakulla, some Cherokees, still bitter over this treatment, raided Virginia's frontier settlements while returning to the Tennessee Valley. In response, the settlers killed several Cherokees, and the situation quickly spiraled out of control. In April 1759, Moytoy of Citico led a raid into Virginia that killed several settlers. Both Demeré and Attakullakulla demanded the surrender of some of the murderers, but were unsuccessful.\n\nFearing the situation would dissolve into open warfare, Governor Lyttelton placed an embargo on the sale of guns and ammunition to the Cherokee in August 1759. Several Cherokees, especially in Great Tellico and Citico, began turning to the French for weapons. In early September, a soldier from Fort Loudoun, an English merchant and an English parkhorseman were killed and their scalps exchanged for French ammunition.\n\nAfter Demeré reported that the Cherokee were blocking roads into the Overhill country, Governor Lyttelton began making preparations to march against the Cherokee in October 1759. As he was making these preparations, a Cherokee delegation led by Oconostota arrived in Charleston to sue for peace. Skeptical of their intentions, Lyttelton ordered them held prisoner (ostensibly for their protection). He departed for Fort Prince George with 1,700 troops and the Cherokee captives, arriving on December 9, 1759. Shortly after his arrival, he negotiated a peace treaty with Attakullakulla, freeing Oconostota and several other Cherokee captives, and promising to release the remaining captives when the Cherokees who had killed white settlers were turned over.\n\nOconostota and Attakullakulla returned to Fort Prince George in February 1760 to demand the release of the remaining hostages, but Richard Coytmore (who had replaced Lachlan McIntosh as commander of Fort Prince George's garrison) refused. On February 16, Oconostota requested a meeting with Coytmore. When Coytmore arrived at the meeting outside the fort, he was mortally wounded in an ambush orchestrated by Oconostota. The enraged garrison responded by killing the remaining hostages.\n\nDemeré had begun preparing Fort Loudoun for a siege in September 1759. On September 9, after the Cherokee tried to drive away the fort's cattle, Demeré ordered the cattle to be brought inside the fort, where they were butchered and their meat salted. In November of that year, John Stuart arrived with 70 reinforcements, increasing the fort's garrison to 200. In January 1760, Demeré reported the fort had stockpiled enough meat for four months and enough corn for several weeks.\n\nOutraged by the events at Fort Prince George, the Cherokee, led by Standing Turkey and Willenawah, launched an attack against Fort Loudoun on March 20, 1760. The fort's cannons prevented them from getting close enough to inflict serious damage, however, and after firing on the fort for four days, the Cherokee settled in for a long siege. In June 1760, a force of 1,300 British regulars led by Archibald Montgomerie destroyed several of the Lower Towns and invaded the Middle Towns, but after encountering stiff opposition at Etchoe Pass, retreated to Charleston. During the same period, a force led by William Byrd III marched down the Holston Valley from Virginia with plans to relieve the fort, but their progress was very gradual.\n\nAttakullakulla, who remained on good terms with the garrison, was expelled from the Council at Chota for warning the garrison that Oconostota had planned a ruse to lure them out of the fort. In early June 1760, Demeré reduced the rations to one quart of corn for three men. In early July, the garrison ran out of bread, and was forced to subsist on horse meat. A dispatch in late July described the condition of the fort's garrison as \"miserable beyond description.\" News of Montgomerie's retreat further demoralized the garrison, and men began deserting. On August 6, 1760, Demeré called a Council of War, which determined it was \"impracticable to hold out any longer.\" John Stuart and James Adamson met with Oconostota and Standing Turkey at Chota to negotiate the fort's surrender. The fort, its cannon, and gunpowder would be turned over to the Cherokee, while the soldiers would be allowed to keep their personal arms and baggage.\n\nThe flag was lowered at the fort for the final time on August 8, 1760, and the garrison set out for Fort Prince George the following day. They camped for the night at the mouth of Cane Creek, along the Tellico River near modern Tellico Plains. On the morning of August 10, some 700 Cherokees suddenly attacked the camp. The garrison briefly returned fire before surrendering. In the melee, three officers, twenty-three privates, and three women were killed. Demeré was reportedly forced to dance, and had dirt stuffed in his mouth before he was executed. Stuart, the only officer to survive the assault, was ransomed by Attakullakulla. The remaining garrison and their families were taken captive. Most were ransomed in the ensuing months.\n\nPrior to leaving the fort, the garrison had buried several bags of gunpowder (in violation of the terms of surrender), which was suggested as a possible motive for the Cherokee attack at Cane Creek. However, John Stevens, a member of the fort's garrison who survived the attack, suggested the Cherokee had planned the attack all along.\n\nAfter receiving news of the fort's capture, Governor Kerlerec of Louisiana dispatched French ships into the interior in an attempt to occupy the fort, but the ships were unable to navigate the Tennessee River. In the Summer of 1761, an invasion led by James Grant destroyed a dozen Lower and Middle towns. Seeing their position as untenable, the Cherokee negotiated a peace treaty with Grant, which was signed on September 23, 1761. In November, Old Hop negotiated a peace treaty with Byrd's men at Long Island of the Holston. Henry Timberlake and Thomas Sumter, soldiers in Byrd's expedition, visited the Overhill towns in 1761–1762 as part of a peace mission. In his \"Memoirs\", Timberlake merely noted that Fort Loudoun was in ruins.\n\nSequoyah, a prominent 19th-century Cherokee scholar, was born at Tuskegee, a village which had developed just south of the fort. Stones from Fort Loudoun may have been used to construct the Tellico Blockhouse, an American outpost located across the river from the fort, in the 1790s. Louis Phillipe, the future King of France, visited the Blockhouse while in exile in the United States in 1797, and noted that Fort Loudoun was mostly rubble and brush. He suggested the site of the fort had been poorly selected. After the Cherokee relinquished control of the area with the signing of the Calhoun Treaty in 1819, ownership of the fort's ruins changed hands several times.\nHistorian P.M. Radford published an article about the fort, \"Old Fort Loudoun\", in 1897, and noted that all traces of the fort, with the exception of the well, had vanished. The following year, author Mary Noailles Murfree published a novel about the fort, \"The Story of Old Fort Loudon\", which included several drawings by illustrator Ernest Peixotto. The Colonial Dames of America placed a marker at the site of the fort in 1917. In a 1925 article, \"Fort Loudoun on the Little Tennessee,\" historian Philip Hamer suggested the fort's earthworks were still discernible.\n\nWith sporadic support from the state, and from the federal government via the Works Progress Administration, preservationists researched the fort's history and began reconstructing the fort starting in 1935 during the Great Depression. The Fort Loudoun Association, which had been founded in 1933, maintained the reconstructed fort as a public park, and conducted further excavations over the subsequent three decades. The fort was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.\n\nThe Fort Loudoun Association was one of several groups to oppose the Tennessee Valley Authority's construction of Tellico Dam at the mouth of the Little Tennessee River in the 1960s, as the fort would be flooded by the dam's reservoir. At a contentious public meeting on the proposed dam in 1964, legendary local judge Sue K. Hicks, the Fort Loudoun Association's president, engaged in a verbal altercation with TVA Chairman Aubrey Wagner. TVA eventually agreed to fund the raising and reconstruction of the fort. The agency also funded extensive archaeological excavations at the site, which were conducted by the Tennessee Division of Archaeology in 1975–1976. The FLA turned over ownership of the fort to the State of Tennessee for the creation of a state park in 1978.\n\nThe Fort Loudoun Association and the Works Progress Administration launched the \"Fort Loudoun Restoration Project\" in September 1935, with plans to reconstruct the fort based on historical and archaeological research. Excavations at the site, which began in February 1936, were supervised by Hobart S. Cooper. Cooper was advised by archaeologists William S. Webb and Thomas M.N. Lewis. Historians Samuel Cole Williams, Philip Hamer, and Mary Rothrock provided historical research, and the U.S. Army provided engineering advice. These excavations determined the locations of the inner and outer palisades, the powder magazine, and the chimney bases of several structures.\n\nBeginning in 1955, a series of minor excavations were conducted by Ellsworth Brown, Director of the Fort Loudoun Association. These excavations attempted to determine the location of the fort's flagstaff, and explored the location of a structure in the northern part of the fort thought to be Paul Demeré's quarters. Brown conducted further excavations in 1957 to explore the fort's eastern (\"Rivergate\") entrance.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and 1970s, the Tennessee Valley Authority funded a series of excavations at the Fort Loudoun site (designated 40MR1) and other sites in the vicinity as part of mitigation efforts in areas to be flooded by the Tellico Reservoir. The most extensive excavations were conducted from May 1975 through August 1976, and were led by Carl Kuttruff of the Tennessee Division of Archaeology. Approximately 93% of the fort's interior was investigated by hand excavation during this period. Researchers also investigated the area south of the fort, uncovering artifacts from the Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian periods, as well as items related to the Cherokee village of Tuskegee, which developed south of the fort in the late 1750s.\n\nTVA provided 250,000 cubic yards of landfill to raise the site , bringing it above the reservoir's operating levels. Care was taken to preserve the original terrain and hillslope. Shortly after this was completed, the palisade, powder magazine, blacksmith shop, two troops quarters, a temporary barracks, a storehouse, one of the gun platforms, and a Cherokee house (representing Tuskegee) were reconstructed. A number of artifacts from the excavations were placed on display inside the visitor's center.\n\nThe location and purpose of several structures were determined through a combination of archaeological and historical work. A map of the fort drawn by De Brahm suggested the powder magazine was located in the northwest corner of the fort, and it was in this area that excavators discovered the location of the only structure in the fort built with stone walls, consistent with the design of contemporary powder magazines. Excavators uncovered what was likely an ash pit from a forge in the southeast corner of the fort, where De Brahm indicated the fort's blacksmith shop was located. A 1757 letter from Demeré indicated the fort's guardhouse had a double chimney. Excavators noted the only structure in the fort with a double chimney was an elongate building adjacent to the east gate, a position consistent with guardhouse placement at the time. A string of hearths in the western section of the fort indicated the location of the fort's barracks.\n\nFort Loudoun is now situated on an island created by Tellico Lake at the junction of the Little Tennessee and Tellico rivers. State Route 360 (Unicoi Turnpike) passes across the island, connecting the state park to Vonore to the north and the rural areas of Monroe County and the Cherokee National Forest to the south. The park's visitor center, which stands adjacent to the fort, contains a small museum with a model of the fort and several artifacts from the various excavations. Several miles of hiking trails meander through the woods around the fort, as well as the McGhee-Carson Unit across the lake to the south.\n\nThe Cherokee scholar Sequoyah was born at Tuskegee, just south of the fort, circa 1770. The Sequoyah Birthplace Museum, which is operated by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, stands just west of the fort, on the other side of Highway 360. The museum includes a burial mound containing over 200 burials excavated during the Tellico Archaeological Project, which investigated several Cherokee town sites in anticipation of the flooding of the valley by Tellico Dam. Monuments to the Overhill towns of Tanasi and Chota are located along Bacon Ferry Road, just off Highway 360 about south of Fort Loudoun.\n\nThe site of the Tellico Blockhouse, an American outpost that operated from 1794 to 1807, is located across the Little Tennessee River to the east of Fort Loudoun. The blockhouse and its associated structures were uncovered by researchers during the Tellico Archaeological Project, and are now marked by wooden posts and stones. Several artifacts excavated from the blockhouse site (40MR50) are on display at the Fort Loudoun visitor center.\n\nLoudon County, Tennessee, and its county seat, Loudon, are both named for the fort (Loudon County borders Monroe County to the north). The Tennessee Valley Authority's Fort Loudoun Dam, which stands to the north in Lenoir City, and its associated lake are also named for the fort. Other entities named for the fort include Fort Loudoun Electric Cooperative, a local electricity distributor, Fort Loudoun Medical Center in Lenoir City, and Fort Loudoun Middle School in Loudon.\n\n\n"}

The director has described \"Tarnation\" as an attempt to give his disorder filmic form. Of the film, he said: \n\nIt was a completely organic process based on these unusual, psychological experiences I've had in my adult life—these strange, trancelike experiences, similar to sensations I remember from childhood when I had a very high fever. Where I'm half asleep and half awake, just on the cusp of dreamland. And right as I'm about to conk out, this whole plethora of information comes from my own awareness and rushes into my mind's eye. It's like a story, or a poem, or a series of images…It only makes sense for a moment and then it dissipates. It's like this weird waking dream. I wanted to lucidly mimic that in the form of a film and transpose it cinematically. Soon after I met John Cameron Mitchell and I had auditioned for his film \"Shortbus\". I had to break away from everything in New York to go rescue my mother in Texas where my grandfather was, one could say, inadvertently allowing her to overdose on lithium. I had to go out there to be their saving grace. After I nursed her to health. I brought her back to New York with me, documenting everything. When I came back, I met this guy who was an intern at the MIX Film Festival. I showed him about 45 minutes of the film I had been making, which had three working titles at the time. \"Lucid,\" \"The Day I Disappeared\" and \"Tarnation,\" and he said, \"Whatever this is, you should finish it because there's a deadline for this film festival coming up in three weeks.\" So I took my vacation from Mikimotos, where I was working as a door-man, and I went on this crazy editing marathon and got the film in right in the nick of time. I got it into the hands of the then festival director, Stephen Winter, who is also really good friends with John Cameron Mitchell, and that's how everything exploded.\n\n\n"}

It flows in a principally southwesterly direction for some from its source below Moel Feity in the Old Red Sandstone (Black Mountain) hills of the western Brecon Beacons to the Bristol Channel at Swansea. Its main tributaries are the right bank Upper and Lower Clydach Rivers and the Afon Twrch. The total area of the catchment is some . \nThe Tawe passes through a number of towns and villages including Ystradgynlais, Ystalyfera, Pontardawe, and Clydach and meets the sea at Swansea Bay below Swansea. The Tawe Valley (\"Cwm Tawe\" in Welsh) is more commonly known as the Swansea Valley.\n\nOwnership of the riverbed was granted to the Duke of Beaufort in the 17th century by Charles II resulting in exclusive mineral and fishing rights, which is extended as far as requiring permission and payment for bridges which are built over it. This was last exercised in 2008 when Swansea Council was required to pay £281,431 to the estate, as revealed by a Freedom of Information request.\n\nThe lower part of the valley was intensely industrialised in the 18th and 19th centuries and was especially impacted by metal refining and working and to a much lesser extent by porcelain manufacture. Large areas of the lower valley remain contaminated by industrial spoil containing copper, lead, nickel and zinc. The only significant extant relic of those times is a major nickel refinery at Clydach which is part of the Canadian company Vale Inco. The quality of the river has now greatly improved. Large salmon swim up the river to spawn, whilst trout are in abundance.\n\nIn 1992, a barrage was built at the mouth of the river.\n\nNational Cycle Route 43 follows this river for much of its course.\n\nBridges over the River Tawe within the City and County of Swansea, from north to south:\n\nThere are plans for further housing developments on both east and west banks of the River Tawe and a proposal to operate river taxis along the river. A report was commissioned by Natural Resources Wales in 2015 as part of its 'Tawe Trial' initiative - completed by regeneration consultants Trilein Ltd. it recommended a number of initiatives to better connect the urban areas on the west of the river with the more rural areas of Kilvey Hill and Crymlyn Bog beyond to the east.\n\n\n"}

Hudson directed the 1981 Academy Award and BAFTA Award Best Picture \"Chariots of Fire\", a film ranked 19th in the British Film Institute's list of Top 100 British films.\n\nHugh Hudson was born at 27 Welbeck Street, London, the son and only child of Michael Donaldson-Hudson and his second wife Jacynth Mary Ellerton, from Cheswardine in rural north east Shropshire. Michael's father was Ralph Charles Donaldson-Hudson, and his great-grandfather was Charles Donaldson-Hudson, a one-time member of Parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. His paternal ancestors came from Scotland and Cumberland. He was sent to boarding school in 1942 at the age of 6, and thereafter was educated at Eton College.

The company produced, among others, the documentaries \"A for Apple\", which won a Screenwriters' Guild Award, and \"The Tortoise and the Hare\", which was nominated for a BAFTA Award. The company emerged with much success in the 1960s, winning many awards and pioneering a new graphic style for documentary and advertising films.\n\nHudson then began a career in advertising, producing and directing many television commercials.

His first filmmaking job was as a second-unit director on Parker's \"Midnight Express\" (1978).\n\nBetween 1973 and 1975, Hudson wrote and directed \"Fangio, A life at 300 km/h\", a documentary film about motor racing seen through the eyes of Juan Manuel Fangio, five times the world Formula 1 Champion.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1980, Hudson directed his first and most successful feature film, \"Chariots of Fire\" (1981), the story of two British track runners, one a devout Christian and the other an ambitious Jew, in the run-up to the 1924 Olympic Games. The film is said to have revitalized the fading British film industry, and it won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture; Hudson earned a nomination for Best Director. His friend and colleague Vangelis produced an Academy Award-winning score for the film.\n\nVincent Canby of the \"New York Times\" wrote in 1981 \"It's to the credit of both Mr. Hudson and Mr. Welland that \"Chariots of Fire\" is simultaneously romantic and commonsensical, lyrical and comic. ... It's an exceptional film, about some exceptional people.\"\nIn 2017, some 37 years after its showing at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival, it was shown to a large audience at the Classic Screenings beach cinema to help support the bid for the 2024 Olympic Games to be held in Paris.\n\nHudson had rejected numerous feature film offers before \"Chariots of Fire\"'s success. His next production was \"Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes\" (1984) which received four Oscar nominations, and was Ralph Richardson's last screen performance, for which he was nominated in the 1984 Oscars as Best Supporting Actor. It was a success at the box office and with critics.\n\nIn 1985, Hudson directed \"Revolution\", which depicted the American War of Independence, and which was released before it was a fully completed film. The film was a critical and commercial failure at the box office and earned Hudson a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Director.\n\nHudson's next theatrical feature film was \"Lost Angels\" (1989), nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. The film was an American-based drama starring Donald Sutherland and Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys and dealing with disaffected youth in California.\n\nIn 1999, Hudson directed \"My Life So Far\". Jean-Claude Carrière wrote of it, \"Hugh Hudson's film \"My Life So Far\" is a delightful bittersweet film, which covers the start of a boy's life during the first part of the 20th century – from his last baby's bottle to his first cigar. A film which sadly is not known as well as it should be. It is a variation on a universal theme which will never end. There will always be men and women, old people and youngsters, horses and dogs.\" Hudson next directed \"I Dreamed of Africa\" (2000), which was the closing film of the Cannes Film Festival of that year.\n\nIn 2006, Hudson was reported to be working, together with producer John Heyman, on an historical epic based on the life of the monotheistic Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti. The film centres around their tempestuous relationship.\n\nIn 2008, Hudson re-edited \"Revolution\", giving the film a narration by Al Pacino. The \"Observer\" film critic Philip French writing about the new version said, \"Revolution was misunderstood and unjustly treated on its first appearance twenty years ago. Seeing it again in the director's slightly revised version it now strikes me as a masterpiece – profound, poetic and original. Hudson's film should take its place among the great movies about history and about individual citizens living in times of dramatic social change. One hopes it will finally find the wide audience it deserves.\"\n\nHudson co-produced \"Chariots of Fire\", the 2012 stage adaptation of the film of the same title. The stage adaptation was his idea, for the London Olympic year. Also in 2012, it was announced that Hudson would direct \"Midnight Sun\", a feature film about a child who tries to help a family of polar bears on the shrinking polar ice cap. Hudson co-wrote the script as well. The script became \"The Journey Home\" with directors Roger Spottiswoode and Brando Quilici replacing Hudson.\n\nIn 2016, he staged his debut as opera director with The Crucible at Staatstheater Braunschweig. The second run of the opera was to sold-out audiences. The stage design was created by the British artist Brian Clarke.\n\nIn 2016, Hudson directed the period drama \"Altamira\", about the discovery of the famous Spanish cave paintings. The film stars Antonio Banderas and Rupert Everett.\nNew York Times gave the film a glowing review. Released in two us cities the film then was distributed by Netflix in USA/Canada and Sky in the UK. The Spanish release was very successful.\n\nIn 1988, Hudson directed a 2-minute advert for British Rail, a parody of the Post Office Film Unit's 25-minute documentary, \"Night Mail\", made in 1936. Poet W. H. Auden had written verse specifically to fit the original 1936 film's footage, which showed the enormous scale of BR's daily operation and the structure of the 'sectorised' business. The opening sequence of Hudson's British Rail advert features the northbound Travelling Post Office with Auden's original verse, narrated by Sir Tom Courtenay.\n\nSome of the other many acclaimed advertisements created by Hudson include the 1989 British Airways \"Face\" advert seen in over 80 countries around the world and running for almost a decade; the 1979 Fiat Strada \"Figaro\" advert; and the Benson & Hedges \"Swimming Pool\" and \"salvage\" adverts . In 2007 he created his Silverjet advert, a direct parody of his own 1989 British Airways advert. He also created the Courage Best \"Gercha\" advert and the Cinzano \"Aeroplane\" advert. Hudson also directed \"Kinnock – The Movie\" (1987), an election broadcast for the British Labour Party.\n\nIn 2003, Hudson was given a special Cannes Lions award on the 50th Anniversary of the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, an award given only to directors who have won the Grand Prix more than once. Hudson has won Grand Prix Cannes Lions awards for his 1972 Levi's \"Walking Behinds\" and 1978 Coty L'Aimant \"French Lesson\" adverts.\n\nIn August 2007, in Nîmes, France, \"Un Realisateur dans la Ville\", a festival created by Gérard Depardieu and Jean-Claude Carrière to showcase each year the work of one director, featured the work of Hugh Hudson, showing eight films over 5 days. The festival premiered an Al Pacino-narrated version of \"Revolution\" called \"Revolution Revisited\".\n\nIn October 2008, at the Dinard Festival of British Film, Hudson's work was honoured. As a tribute five of his films were shown, with \"My Life So Far\" opening the festival. \"Revolution Revisited\" was the subject of a Q&A by the director.\n\nHudson's first marriage on 25 August 1977, was with painter Susan Michie (born 8 December 1946), the daughter of Alastair Milne Michie, with whom he had a son, born in 1978. In November 2003, he married actress Maryam d'Abo, who played Kara Milovy in \"The Living Daylights\" (1987).\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played for the United States in five chess Olympiads. He also played in two Interzonal tournaments (1955, 1962).\n\nOn March 18, 2005, the United States Chess Federation (USCF) proclaimed him \"Dean of American Chess.\"\n\nBisguier was born in New York City and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science. He was taught chess at the age of 4 by his father, a mathematician. In 1944, aged 15, he was third at the Bronx Empire Chess Club. In 1946, aged 17, he came fifth in the U.S. Open at Pittsburgh, followed by seventh place in 1948. Later that year, he took the U.S. Junior Championship and was invited to the New York City 1948–49 International Tournament. Throughout the 1940s, he was considered one of the United States' best players, with Larry Evans, George Kramer, and Walter Shipman. As he gained in strength, Bisguier was coached by Master Alexander Kevitz.\n\nIn 1949 he retained the U.S. Junior Championship title, and also won the Manhattan Chess Club Championship. In 1950 he won the first of his three U.S. Open titles, and also won at Southsea in England.\n\nArmy service interrupted his U.S. chess career during 1951 to 1953, but he managed to get leave to play in two European events. He played at the Helsinki Olympiad 1952, and then won the third annual Christmas tournament at Vienna 1952 with a 9–2 score. He earned the International Master title in 1950 from his Southsea victory.\n\nAfter a poor performance in the U.S. Open in 1953, he entered the Philadelphia Candidates' Tournament for the U.S. Championship and came through with a first-place finish and another over-2600 performance. His meteoric rise culminated in winning the 1954 United States Chess Championship at New York. He also won the 2nd Pan American Chess Championship at Los Angeles 1954. In 1956 at Oklahoma City, he added the U.S. Open Chess Championship title to his U.S. Championship. Bisguier achieved the International Grandmaster title in 1957. He tied with Bobby Fischer for first–second places at the U.S. Open at Cleveland 1957, where Fischer was awarded the title on tiebreak.\n\nBisguier represented the United States at five Chess Olympiads; his totals over 82 games are (+29−18=35), for 56.7 per cent. His detailed results, from olimpbase.org:\n\nFollowing his U.S. title in 1954, Bisguier regularly returned to compete for the national championship, but was never able to repeat his success. The late 1950s saw the sensational rise of Bobby Fischer, who swept the eight U.S. Championship tournaments that he contested. Bisguier and Fischer were tied for first place going into the last round of the 1962–1963 event, and they still had to face each other. Bisguier had a promising position but made a mistake, which Fischer punished spectacularly, allowing Fischer to take the game and the title. Fischer scored 8/11, with Bisguier a point back in clear second place. Bisguier also served as a second to Fischer at several international events.\n\nMost of Bisguier's play after the mid-1960s was limited to U.S. events. He won National Opens in 1970 (jointly), 1974, and 1978. He won the Lone Pine tournament in 1973, tied for second place behind reigning world champion Boris Spassky in the international tournament in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1969, and took first place in the first-ever Grand Prix in 1980. He took first place in the U.S. Senior Open in 1989, thus winning a U.S. championship at every age level of chess. He won the Senior Open again in 1997 and 1998.\n\nBisguier continued to play regularly at the Metrowest Chess Club in Natick, MA until 2014. He qualified for and competed in the 2011 Metrowest Club Championship.\n\nFor many years, Bisguier was hired to play in towns throughout the U.S. to give exhibitions, and to popularize chess and the USCF. For about 20 years, Bisguier was the representative the USCF chose to send to a state for one or two days to play at a hospital, college, or prison, so the public could get a chance to play the Grandmaster and former U.S. Champion. He commented: \"I was delighted to do it. I was very lucky to get so much out of chess. I tried to give something back.\"\n\nVictor Niederhoffer, the hedge fund manager, took chess lessons from Bisguier as an adult.\n\nBisguier was a regular contributor to \"Chess Life\" magazine. In 2003 he wrote a book on his best games from 1945–1960 titled \"The Art of Bisguier\".\n\nThe following game is Bisguier's sole win against Bobby Fischer, their first game played. Their second game was a draw, after which Fischer won 13 straight — perhaps the longest unbroken winning streak between grandmasters in history. Fischer was aged 13 at the time of this game, but already a strong player and won his celebrated Game of the Century against Donald Byrne in this same tournament.\n\n"}

As of 2018 the Swiss team was ranked 7th in the world by the IIHF.\n\nBibi Torriani served as the Switzerland national team captain from 1933 to 1939. He played on a forward line known as \"The ni-storm\" (), with brothers Hans Cattini and Ferdinand Cattini. The line was named for the last syllable (\"-ni\") of players' surnames. The ni-storm was regarded as the top line of HC Davos and Switzerland's national hockey team. Torriani served as head coach of the Switzerland men's national ice hockey team in 1946–47, and again from 1948–49 to 1951–52.\n\nFrom a bronze medal at the 1953 World Championships until the silver medal of 2013 and 2018.

They finally fell to Sweden in the quarterfinals. At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, the Swiss nearly stunned Canada again in round-robin play, taking the heavily favored Canadians to a shootout, which they lost 1–0 for a narrow 3–2 loss.\n\n\n\n\nRoster for the 2019 IIHF World Championship.\n\nHead coach: Patrick Fischer\n\nSwitzerland made their U20 debut in 1977 at the A Pool championships held in Montreal. Their first game was an 18–1 loss to the Soviet Union. Switzerland was relegated to the B Pool, but were promoted back to Pool A after posting a 4–0 record with wins over the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy and France. This began a consistent cycle of relegation and promotion, and Switzerland did not win their first A Pool game until 1991 when they defeated Norway 2–1 to avoid relegation.\n\nSwitzerland's presence in the A Pool became more consistent after the IIHF changed its format to include a medal round after the round-robin in 1995. The new format allowed 2 new teams to join Pool A, which were Slovakia and Switzerland. In 1998, the Swiss won their first-ever quarter-final game over Sweden in a shootout, thanks to stellar play from goaltender David Aebischer. The team lost 2–1 to Finland in the semi-finals but rebounded to win the bronze medal with a 4–3 win over the Czech-Republic. In 2002, Switzerland upset Slovakia in a shootout in the quarter-finals on the back of great play from goaltender Tobias Stephan. Switzerland lost to Canada in the semi-finals, and faced Finland in the bronze medal match. The Swiss were optimistic, having recorded a 3–0 win over Finland in their opening game of tournament, but they lost the match 5–1 for a 4th-place finish.\n\nSwitzerland was relegated in 2008 along with Denmark. Switzerland hosted the 2009 Div I tournament and were promoted back to Pool A.\n\nIn the 2010 tournament Switzerland earned a spot in the quarter-finals against a heavily favored Russia. The Swiss pulled off a major upset by beating the Russians 3–2 in overtime. Nino Niederreiter scored twice in the game, including the OT winner. Switzerland lost 6–1 in the semi-finals to Canada and then 11–4 to Sweden in the bronze medal match for a 4th-place finish, their highest since the 2002 tournament. The lopsided score was the highest margin of victory in a medal game since the new format took place in 1995. In an interesting twist, Switzerland was originally to host the 2010 tournament, but withdrew their application due to fear of being relegated based on their poor performance in recent tournaments. The host city was rumored to be Bern or Lugano.\n\n"}
{"id": "1817459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817459", "title": "WFLY", "text": "WFLY\n\nWFLY (\"FLY 92.3\") is a Top 40/CHR station licensed to Troy, New York and serving New York's Capital District as well as the surrounding areas, including the Adirondacks. The station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting and is considered their flagship station. The studios are located at 6 Johnson Road in Latham, while their transmitter is located on the Helderberg Escarpment antenna farm in New Scotland. WFLY is the oldest FM radio call sign currently in use in the Albany market, as it has been in use since 1948.\n\nWFLY signed on in 1948 as the radio station of \"The Troy Times Record\" newspaper, published by Frank Loyd York. The station was originally experimental and intended to use an FM signal to broadcast a radio-facsimile image of that day's paper to subscribers with the equipment to receive it. The station was programmed with classical music, news and local interest programs. Upon sign on, it had an Effective Radiated Power of 5.4 kW. Beginning in 1949, it was a member of the Rural Radio Network, receiving network programming via an over the air relay of WVCV in Cherry Valley. The Rural Radio Network dropped most of its farm content and switched to mostly classical music, which was originated at WQXR in New York City. This was received via over air relay from WKIP-FM on Mount Beacon. This affiliation lasted until 1960, when the Rural Radio Network folded. The classical music continued as locally produced programming.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the FM audience was changing, and the Troy Record had a difficult time funding the station. In 1970, the station switched to a Top 40/Oldies format with live DJs. At that point, they were known as \"The Big 92\". DJs on \"The Big 92\" included Craig Stevens, Gary Mitchell, Rex Gregory, Dale Lane, Bob Harris, Bob Roberts, Johnny Lance and Chris Calvert. Though the station (the first commercial FM rock station in the Albany market) did very well with the new format, protests over the format flip among classical music listeners were intense and a partial victory was claimed in late 1971, when the Troy Record sold WFLY to Functional Broadcasting. The programming was changed to an easy listening/classical hybrid. The partial return of classical was not successful, given the sign-on of WMHT-FM as a full-time classical station. By this time, there were already two other easy listening outlets in the Albany-Schenectady-Troy market.\n\nFunctional lost money on WFLY, and sold the station in early 1975 to the Rochester, New York-based Rust Communications Group. After the sale, the station changed programming to an automated album-oriented rock format, billing itself as \"sophisticated rock.\" WFLY went adult contemporary in 1977, and then reverted to top 40 in 1979 as \"The New FLY 92 FM\". In 1983, the station was sold to Five States Tower Company, owned by Rob Dyson, who also owned WPDH and WEOK in Poughkeepsie. In 1987, it was subsequently sold to Jim Morrell's Albany Broadcasting. The second go-around of Top 40 was the charm, as WFLY caused the eventual deaths of AM powerhouses WTRY and WPTR. Under program director Todd Pettengill (then a little known DJ from WBUG in Amsterdam, New York), the station anchored itself securely in the CHR format. In the following years, most rivals eventually failed, though three stations (WGFM/WGY-FM (\"99 GFM\", later \"Electric 99 WGY FM\") from 1982 to 1990, WKLI-FM (\"K100\") from 1996 to 1999, and WKKF (\"102.3 Kiss FM\") since 2000) have survived for an extended period (though WKKF has more recently been directly competing against WFLY's sister station WAJZ). In 2005, the station rebranded with the full frequency as \"FLY 92.3\" and tweaked its format to be more modern rock-leaning to separate itself more from co-owned WAJZ (which had taken on a more rhythmic format); however, over time, the station has reverted to a more mainstream CHR format.\n\nWFLY has aired a CHR format since 1979, the second longest-running commercial format in Capital District radio (WGNA-FM's country music format has been in place since 1973), and is also one of the oldest \"heritage\" stations in the format. The station has also been through several playlist evolutions throughout the years; however, the station has stayed true to a CHR format for over almost 40 years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1817480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817480", "title": "City Arts Centre, Dublin", "text": "City Arts Centre, Dublin\n\nCityArts in Dublin, Ireland, is a community arts organization founded in 1973.\n\nOriginally named, \"Grapevine Arts Centre\" and later \"City Arts Centre\", it occupied a number of premises in the centre of Dublin, beginning at Mary Street and then North Great Georges Street, North Frederick Street, Moss Street and opening at Bachelor's Walk in 2010. The organisation grew from a need by a group of teenagers in Dublin's culturally bleak mid 20th Century. This was particularly the case if you happened to come from a working-class background, which was the case for most of the Grapevine founders, and is also the reason why the location of the centre was the unfashionable inner city's, North Side. The three main initiators of the project were Jackie Aherne, Anto Fahy and Sandy Fitzgerald.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, the organisation became more culturally politicised, linking in with the radical community arts movement in the UK. This fruitful collaboration resulted in a wider world view and a move to work for a different perspective on culture, one that recognised difference and the rights of people with regard to cultural equality. Linking with similar projects that had emerged (notably City Workshop and Moving Theatre in Dublin and Neighbourhood Open Workshops in Belfast) in Ireland by the early 1980s, the community arts movement grew to be a force for change, resulting in new policies and perspectives that challenged the cultural orthodoxy. In 1984 the representative group CAFE (Creative Activity For Everyone) was formed, with Grapevine as a founding member.\n\nGrapevine's artistic programme grew alongside its philosophical awareness and this programme was diverse and multifaceted and took place both within the centre, around the suburbs of Dublin and throughout Ireland. Examples of this diversity can seen through its street theatre programme, directed by Thom McGinty (later to become the Diceman), hair cutting, street fashion design studio, audio art, street events, gigs and random acts of fun in public places. They had an innovative visual arts programme directed for a while by artist John Carson, later of Artangel in the UK. This included early shows by John Kindness amongst others including an exhibition of drawings from the survivors of Hiroshima, organised in association with a young U2.\n\nThe relationship with U2 continued into the centre's next phase when, in 1988, there was a name change from Grapevine Arts Centre to City Arts Centre when the organisation occupied a warehouse building on Moss Street near Tara Street Station, then the largest centre of its kind in Ireland. U2 provided fully equipped rehearsal spaces for young bands in the basement. Over this was a cafe and theatre space initially run by Declan Gorman and above that a gallery space initially run by Tommy Weir. Sandy Fitzgerald continued as Director through to 2001. The Arts Council never fully backed the centre favouring the highly regarded Project Arts Centre, despite the City Arts Centre clear leadership profile for community arts.\n\nThe Centre actually owned this building, having bought it in a then run-down area. However, the property become rather valuable. There was an opportunity to create a large civic project, when a partnership between City Quay School to the rear of the centre and a community hall adjacent to the centre were brought into a scheme for an innovative socio/cultural project at the entrance to the docklands, then at the beginning of its transformation. The scheme needed a piece of vacant land that linked all the properties but Dublin Dockland Development Authority rejected the idea, although both Dublin City Council and The Arts Council, plus all the local representatives supported the project. As a result, City Arts Centre became an anomaly within the dockland development. Sandy Fitzgerald stepped down as director of the centre in 2000, after 27 years. City Arts Centre, under the directorship of Declan McGonagle, decided to sell the building and to close down its on-site programmes and to engage in what it called the Civil Arts Inquiry, a two-year-long series of meetings, events and symposia aimed at formulating the future needs and future direction of community art.

{"id": "1817485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817485", "title": "Battle of Le Mans", "text": "Battle of Le Mans\n\nThe Battle of Le Mans was a German victory during the Franco-Prussian War that ended French resistance in western France.\n\nAfter capturing the armies of the French Empire at Sedan and Metz in the fall of 1870, the German armies under the command of Helmuth von Moltke besieged Paris in September 1870. The newly-formed French Third Republic rejected a German peace offer and decided to continue the war and raise fresh armies to defeat the Germans.\n\nThe first French attempt to relieve Paris was defeated by the Germans at Orléans from 2 to 4 December by Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia's Second Army. After a second defeat at Beaugency on 10 December, General Antoine Chanzy's poorly supplied \"Armée de la Loire\" retreated undisturbed west to Le Mans on 15 December. Friedrich Karl's army was at the limits of its lines of communications and subject to \"franc-tireur\" attacks. His cavalry could not pursue along the icy roads. The war was also taking its toll on the Germans, with much of the Prince's infantry by now being composed of inexperienced recruits unaccustomed to long marches. Two days later Moltke confirmed the order to not pursue.\n\nThe retreat to Le Mans through the muddy and hilly terrain proved disastrous for the French army. Thousands of soldiers deserted, clogging the roads or hiding in the forests. Lack of paved roads resulted in entire convoys getting immobilized along the way. The force that arrived in Le Mans was exhausted from the poor march organization and constant defeats.\n\nLe Mans had rail lines to Nantes, Brest and Paris and thus provided the French with lines of retreat. Chanzy began to prepare the city for the defensive. The city had no significant geographical or fortified defenses and Chanzy's maintenance of his position was dependent on German supply difficulties south of Paris. The German General Staff was able to overcome these deficiencies and prepare Friedrick Karl's army for an offensive to destroy the \"Armée de la Loire\".\n\nMoltke observed the French attempts to reform their defeated armies and decided to finish them off before they could do so. With the benefit of the improved supply situation, on 1 January 1871 he ordered Friedrich Karl to advance west between Vendôme and Chartres and destroy Chanzy's forces.\n\nChanzy submitted plans to the Government of National Defense for another attack on the German siege army at Paris. The government persuaded him to await until the second week of January, when two new army corps would have been raised at Cherbourg and Vierzon. The French plan was to inflict as much attrition as possible on the Germans to soften their peace terms.\n\nChanzy sent a division-sized column under General Alphonse Jouffroy to harass the German Second Army, while the rest of his 100,000-strong army dug in. Jouffroy ambushed two German battalions on 27 December at Troo but the Germans fought their way out. The French column then attacked the German position in the town of Vendôme on 31 December but was defeated. Jouffroy prepared for another attack on 5 January that ran headlong onto Friedrich Karl's offensive.\n\nFriedrich Karl arranged his army on a broad arc to encircle the French at Le Mans and began the offensive on 6 January. The Württembergian XIII Corps under the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg advanced on the right flank along the Huisne river. X Corps under General Konstantin Bernhard von Voigts-Rhetz covered the left flank by advancing down the Loir. In the center, III Corps and IX Corps followed each other down the main road to Le Mans.\n\nThe Germans defeated Jouffroy's attack and pursued his retreating men west, using the same routes as Chanzy's army had done weeks before. French delaying tactics and the difficult terrain did not prevent the Germans from advancing 50 miles in six days. Chanzy was angered by the speed of the German offensive and on 8 January gave his most trusted lieutenant, Admiral Bernard Jauréguiberry, command over the forward columns to shore up their retreat. The advance of the German X Corps was halted for the day. The two German corps in the center continued to push forward with little opposition and on 9 January Chanzy sent a division to check them at Ardenay. The French held their positions in the snow until nightfall. These delaying actions could not stop the Germans and on 10 January Chanzy launched a general counter-attack to buy time for his defensive preparations in Le Mans.\n\nThe French army was greatly demoralized and ill-equipped. Much of the French ammunition had been soaked in the rain giving the Prussians a major advantage against the obsolete French gunnery. But Chanzy still ordered his forces into trenches prepared before Le Mans. The Germans hit the French left flank guarded by the Huisne River. The flank was turned and nearly routed until artillery and a counterattack halted the German attack. A bold German attack was launched and overwhelmed the French right flank. Jauréguiberry attempted to rally the broken troops to mount a counterattack but failed to do so. The French defense dissolved, the stragglers falling back into Le Mans.\n\nThe battle had completely ended French resistance in the west. Friedrich Karl's supply lines were stretched thin and his army also was so exhausted from its campaign along the Loire River that he did not pursue Chanzy. The French retreated first to Alençon and then to Laval on 13 January. Chanzy continued to plan further attacks but his hungry and fatigued horde of an army was incapable of offensive action and the fighting around the Loire came to an end.\n\nMore than 25,000 Frenchmen were killed and wounded and 50,000 French soldiers deserted during and after the battle. Friedrich Karl noted German casualties of 3,000 men in his diary.\n\n"}

{"id": "1817510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817510", "title": "Interstate 476", "text": "Interstate 476\n\nInterstate 476 (I-476) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway of Interstate 76 in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania designated between Interstate 95 near Chester and Interstate 81 near Scranton, serving as the primary north–south Interstate corridor through eastern Pennsylvania. It consists of both the Mid-County Expressway, locally referred to as the \"Blue Route\" (although no signs exist with that designation), through the suburban Philadelphia-area counties of Delaware and Montgomery, and the tolled, Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike connecting the Philadelphia metropolitan area with the Lehigh Valley, the Poconos, and the Wyoming Valley. The Blue Route passes through suburban areas, while the Northeast Extension predominantly runs through rural areas of mountains, forest and farmland, with development closer to Philadelphia and in the Lehigh Valley and the Wyoming Valley. I-476 intersects many major roads including Interstate 76 (the Schuylkill Expressway) in West Conshohocken, Interstate 276 (the Pennsylvania Turnpike) in Plymouth Meeting, U.S. Route 22 near Allentown, and Interstate 80 near Hickory Run State Park.\n\nAt its opening in the early 1970s, I-476 was a four-mile-long, four-lane spur expressway connecting the Schuylkill Expressway with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. It significantly helped reduce congestion through King of Prussia and the Schuylkill Expressway as it provided a more direct link from the Main Line suburbs to the Northern suburbs and New Jersey. The highway was initially planned to connect down to I-95 in Delaware County, but due to environmental and local opposition, this portion did not open until 1990.\n\nIn 1996, the I-476 designation was affixed to the pre-existing Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, replacing Pennsylvania Route 9. This was an older four lane pre Interstate limited access highway. Of earlier design, its cross section was very narrow, with only 10 feet between opposing lanes of traffic in places. This extended I-476 north of Plymouth Meeting to Clarks Summit (near Scranton) as a part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system. The crown jewel of this expressway was a state-of-the-art three-level interchange, to connect the new I-476 with the older Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension. This provided direct access to both I-276 east and I-476 north, now on the Northeast Extension. The Northeast Extension served the Lehigh Valley at U.S. Route 22, with connection to I-78, the southern bypass of Allentown/Bethlehem. With the completion of the Northeast Extension, I-476 surpassed I-495 in Massachusetts as the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway, a record it will hold until the completion of I-369 in Texas.\n\nI-476 was widened to 6 lanes between I-76 and I-276 in 1990-1992. It was later widened to 6 lanes up to Lansdale between 2011-2017.\n\nThe portion of Interstate 476 between Interstate 95 and Interstate 276 runs north–south through Delaware and Montgomery Counties and is officially known as the Mid-County Expressway and the Veterans Memorial Highway, as well as by the nickname the \"Blue Route\". The road's southern terminus is at a junction with Interstate 95 near Chester, a city southwest of Philadelphia, near Philadelphia International Airport. Heading north, the road immediately narrows to a four-lane parkway north of Exit 1, MacDade Boulevard. It winds through the western Philadelphia suburbs of Wallingford and Swarthmore, where I-476 comes to an interchange with Baltimore Pike just west of Springfield. From here, the freeway continues north to Springfield, where it meets U.S. Route 1 at a three-level diamond interchange.\n\nPast US 1, I-476 continues through wooded suburban areas and interchanges with Pennsylvania Route 3 in Broomall, where it widens to six lanes. The route continues to Radnor Township, on the Main Line, where it interchanges with U.S. Route 30. Stone monuments, including a large stone cairn atop a hill and a large crushed-stone image of a mythological griffin on a hillside, were constructed at the US 30 interchange to commemorate Radnor's history as part of the Welsh Tract. Proceeding northward, the route enters Montgomery County and comes to an interchange with Interstate 76 (Schuylkill Expressway) at West Conshohocken. After crossing the Schuylkill River on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, the freeway heads into Plymouth Township, where it has interchanges with Ridge Pike and Germantown Pike before coming to the Mid-County Interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. The entire length of the Blue Route is designated the Blue Route Scenic Byway, a Pennsylvania Scenic Byway.\n\nBeyond the Mid-County Interchange, Interstate 476 enters the Pennsylvania Turnpike system, interchanging with Interstate 276 and continuing north as the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The route continues through the Philadelphia suburbs and has an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 63 near Lansdale that serves the North Penn Valley region. Past this interchange, the route enters a more rural setting of woods and farms, crossing into Bucks County and coming to an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 663 near Quakertown. The Northeast Extension continues north into Lehigh County, part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, past the PA 663 interchange. Here, it has a ramp to the dual-access Allentown Service Plaza in Upper Macungie Township, and just north of it, I-476 interchanges with U.S. 22 (Lehigh Valley Thruway) near Allentown, which offers an indirect connection to Pennsylvania Route 309 and Interstate 78.\n\nNorth of Allentown, the route runs through more farmland before passing under the Blue Mountain in the Lehigh Tunnel and entering Carbon County in the Pocono Mountains. Here, I-476 crosses over the Lehigh River and interchanges with U.S. 209 near Lehighton. Continuing through mountainous areas, it has an E-ZPass-only exit for Pennsylvania Route 903 and cuts through Hickory Run State Park before interchanging with Interstate 80 and Pennsylvania Route 940 just to the north of the state park. The route continues through mountainous terrain, heading into Luzerne County and coming to an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 115 in Bear Creek that provides access to nearby Wilkes-Barre. The route comes to a toll barrier near Pittston that marks the northern end of the toll ticket system in the Northeast Extension. A short distance later, an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 315 provides indirect access to Interstate 81 and Scranton. \n\nPast this interchange, I-476 enters Lackawanna County and crosses built-up areas of the Wyoming Valley as it skirts around Scranton, with a mainline all-electronic toll plaza, where tolls can be paid with E-ZPass or toll-by-plate, and an exit to Keyser Avenue. North of Scranton in Clarks Summit, the route crosses a valley on the , John E. Fitzgerald Memorial Bridge, comes to a hairpin curve, and ends at an interchange with connections to I-81, US 6 and US 11. US 6 joins the turnpike for less than to connect between I-81 and US 11. As this is beyond the Clarks Summit all-electronic toll plaza, no toll is collected on this short segment.\n\nThe Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike uses the ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas along with the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a motorist loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the motorist leaves. Cash, credit cards, and E-ZPass are accepted at traditional toll plazas. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate using toll-by-plate (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. As of 2020, it costs a passenger vehicle $14.60 to travel the length of the Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $10.20 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $2.40 using toll-by-plate and $1.10 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.\n\nThe tickets along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were originally handed out by person. In 1987, machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets. In 1990, an electronic toll collection system was proposed for the Pennsylvania Turnpike, where a motorist would create an account and use an electronic device that would be read from an electronic tollbooth. The motorist would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, which was to be called E-ZPass, was planned to be implemented by 1998. The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000. On December 2, 2000, E-ZPass debuted along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Mid-County and Lehigh Valley. On December 15, 2001, E-ZPass was extended to include the entire length of the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Commercial vehicles were allowed to start using E-ZPass on December 14, 2002.\n\nOn November 24, 2004, the day before Thanksgiving, 2,000 Teamsters Union employees went on strike, after contract negotiations failed. This was the first strike in the history of the roadway. As this is usually one of the busiest traffic days in the United States, to avoid traffic jams, tolls were waived for the rest of the day. Starting on November 25, turnpike management personnel collected flat-rate passenger tolls of $2 and commercial tolls of $15 from cash customers on the ticketed system, while E-ZPass customers were charged the lesser of the actual toll or the same flat rates. The strike ended after seven days when both sides reached an agreement on November 30, 2004. Normal toll collection resumed December 1, 2004. The strike occurred one day after the beginning of E-ZPass tolls at Clarks Summit and Keyser Avenue.\n\nThe Turnpike Commission announced plans to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this, tolls will be paid using either E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either of these methods will be billed in the mail using license plate recognition; an additional surcharge will be applied. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls.\n\nOn March 6, 2012, the turnpike commission announced that it was going forward with an all-electronic tolling plan. Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. On April 29, 2018, the turnpike commission implemented all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas. All-electronic tolling will be implemented on the entire length of the Northeast Extension in the later part of 2021. The all-electronic tolling system on the road will initially use toll booths at exits until mainline toll gantries between interchanges are constructed. Mainline toll gantries are planned to begin operation by 2022.\n\nThe Northeast Extension has a callbox every mile for its entire length. In September 2017, the turnpike commission began removing the callboxes due to increased mobile phone usage making the callboxes obsolete. Motorists may also dial *11 on their mobile phones. First responder services are available to all turnpike customers via the State Farm Safety Patrol program. The safety patrol program, which is free, looks for disabled motorists, debris, and accidents along the roadway and provides assistance. The patrol service is available 24 hours every day of the year. Each patrol vehicle covers a stretch of the turnpike. Towing services are available from authorized service garages located near the highway. Pennsylvania State Police Troop T patrols the Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension. It has headquarters in Highspire and a substation at Pocono.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission broadcasts current roadway, traffic, and weather conditions via highway advisory radio transmitters at each exit. Broadcasts are available on 1640 kHz AM and can be received approximately two miles away from each exit. Motorists can also receive alerts and information via the internet, mobile phone, a hotline, and message boards at service plazas through the Turnpike Roadway Information Program (TRIP).\n\nThe Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike has 2 service plazas at Allentown and Hickory Run. The service plazas offer various fast food restaurants, a Sunoco gas station, and an A-Plus convenience store. Other amenities are available such as an ATM, free cell phone charging, picnic areas, restrooms, tourist information, Travel Board information centers, and Wi-Fi. The Allentown plaza contains a seasonal farmers market. The Allentown plaza offers E85 while both plazas offer conventional gasoline and diesel fuel. The Sunoco and A-Plus locations are operated by Energy Transfer Partners (who bought Pennsylvania-based Sunoco in 2012) while the remaining restaurants and general upkeep of the service plazas are operated by HMSHost. \n\nIn 2006, HMSHost was awarded a contract to reconstruct the service plazas along the turnpike. The reconstruction of the service plazas, which is to cost $150 million, will include a food court layout and modernized restrooms. Sunoco will continue to operate the gas stations at the renovated service plazas. The Allentown service plaza was rebuilt between September 2007 and May 2008 while the Hickory Run service plaza was rebuilt between January 2009 and November 2010.\n\nOriginally planned as far back as 1929, the Mid-County Expressway was later proposed by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission as the \"Chester Extension\" of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1954. After the advent of the Interstate Highway System, the project was transferred to the Pennsylvania Department of Highways to be built as part of the system, designating it first as Interstate 495, and later as Interstate 480, as I-76 was designated as I-80S at the time. The present-day I-476 designation was assigned on February 6, 1964, when I-80S was renumbered as I-76.\n\nThe road received its nickname from a 1958 location report indicating various proposed geographic configurations of an expressway through Delaware County with lines of various colors on a map. The \"blue route\" through the Crum Creek valley won out over other contenders, which included a more easterly \"red route\" and \"yellow route\" and a more westerly \"green route\".\nAs one of the most controversial Interstate Highways in Pennsylvania, construction of I-476 began in 1967, but was not completed until 1991 between MacDade Boulevard (Exit 1) and Interstate 76 (Exit 16), and until 1992 between Germantown Pike east/Chemical Road (Exit 19) and Interstate 276/Pennsylvania Turnpike (Exit 20), due to litigation between the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and several communities in the road's path over environmental concerns. However, the section of Interstate 476 (south end of I-476) between I-95 and MacDade Blvd. (Exit 1) was opened in 1987, but signage labeled it as a route \"To MacDade Blvd\" until 1991 when I-476/The Blue Route was opened between Exits 1 and 16, and connected with the short existing section of roadway dating back to 1979 from Exit 16-Exit 19.\n\nAn agreement in 1985 led to many environmental compromises in the road's design, including a downsized four-lane design south of Pennsylvania Route 3 (although a part of the span between exits 9 and 5 has a third lane on the southbound side), ramp meters, and federal scenic route status, prohibiting the erection of advertisement billboards along the entire freeway portion. The Radnor Gateway Enhancement Strategy was implemented to install largescale sculpture elements by artist William P. Reimann, most notably the stone griffin and cairn at Exit 13. While the redesigned highway was largely well-received, the constriction to four lanes has led to bottleneck conditions in the area, and many communities that originally opposed the road have now called for its widening. \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" dubbed I-476 \"the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history\" due to the decades of opposition it garnered.\n\nIn the 2000s, the road underwent a complete rehabilitation project, including paving, bridge repair, and ramp maintenance of the entire length of the freeway between Interstate 95 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The section between I-95 and I-76 was completed in 2007 and the section between I-76 and I-276 was completed in the end of 2011.\n\nIn 1953, an extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike from the mainline near Plymouth Meeting north through Northeastern Pennsylvania to the New York border near Binghamton was proposed. Groundbreaking for the Northeastern Extension occurred on March 25, 1954 in White Haven, with Governor John S. Fine and commission chairman Thomas J. Evans present. The Northeast Extension was planned to run from the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting north to a temporary terminus at Scranton. In April 1954, $233 million in bonds were issued to build the Northeastern Extension along with the Delaware River Bridge on the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike. The Northeast Extension was built with a median in order to save money. Due to the mountainous terrain it passed through, a large amount of earthwork was necessary to build the road along with the construction of large bridges. Among the bridges built was the Clarks Summit Bridge (since renamed for John J. Fitzgerald, Turnpike engineer and superintendent) over US 6/US 11, which was the tallest bridge on the Pennsylvania Turnpike system at . The Northeast Extension also included the two-lane Lehigh Tunnel through Blue Mountain. The tunnel was originally going to be named for commission chairman Evans, but was changed when he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the commission of $19 million (equal to $ today).\n\nThe roadway opened between Plymouth Meeting and the Lehigh Valley interchange near Allentown on November 23, 1955. The highway was extended north to Emerald on December 28, 1955. The Northeast Extension was opened between Emerald and Wyoming Valley on April 1, 1957. The entire length of the Northeast Extension was finished on November 7, 1957 with the completion of the northernmost part between Wyoming Valley and Scranton. The part of the Northeast Extension between Scranton and the New York border would not be built as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system but rather the Interstate Highway System as I-81. At the northern terminus, the Northeast Extension narrowed to two lanes along the northbound off-ramp at Scranton to come to its northern terminus, with an abandoned short spur of the mainline heading north. A pair of trumpet interchanges were built to connect the Northeast Extension and I-81. In 1974, the roadway would be designated PA 9.\nWhen it first opened, traffic on the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was light. By the 1970s, traffic along the roadway would increase with the completion of the connecting I-80 and the rising popularity of the Poconos as a vacation destination. As a result, the two-lane Lehigh Tunnel faced serious congestion. Plans were made to either bypass the tunnel or add a second tube. The turnpike commission decided it would build a second tunnel as the cost was lower than building a bypass. In 1988, a $37 million contract was awarded to build the second tube. Groundbreaking for the tunnel took place on February 14, 1989, with Governor Robert P. Casey in attendance. Excavation of the new tunnel began in July of that year. Construction of the second tube utilized the New Austrian Tunnelling method, which reduced the cost of the tunnel by $5 to $6 million. It was the first tunnel in the United States to use this construction method. The second tube at Lehigh Tunnel opened on November 22, 1991, with Governor Casey in attendance leading a line of antique cars. Construction of the tunnel cost $45 million. The new tube is used for southbound traffic while the original tube carries northbound traffic. The newer tunnel is wider, higher, and brighter than the original.\n\nOn February 1, 1995, the Keyser Avenue interchange near Scranton was slated to open at a cost of $22.4 million. Construction of this interchange also involved constructing a new mainline flat-rate toll barrier near the new interchange.\n\nOn November 1, 1996, the Northeast Extension was added to the Interstate Highway System as an extension of I-476, replacing the PA 9 designation along the road. The addition of the second tube at the Lehigh Tunnel along with new guardrails and line striping was necessary for the toll road to become an Interstate. It was hoped that the Interstate designation would bring economic development and tourism to the areas served by the roadway. This extension resulted in I-476 surpassing the I-495 in Massachusetts as the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway.\nIn 2007, the turnpike commission announced plans to widen the Northeast Extension to six lanes between Mid-County and Lansdale. The project divided this stretch of highway into two sections. Work on the southern section began in January 2008 with the replacement of two bridges over the Northeast Extension to accommodate the widened highway. Construction on the actual widening phase commenced in January 2011. Completion was originally planned in 2013; however, construction fell a year behind schedule. The southern section finished up in October 2014, while work on the northern section started in May 2014. By this point the project scope was expanded to include the Lansdale interchange itself, the roadway to a point one mile north of the interchange, and two new E-ZPass-only ramps at the Lansdale interchange to relieve congestion at the toll plaza. This new northbound exit ramp opened December 4, 2016, and the companion southbound on-ramp opened a week later. The northern section was originally planned to finish by the end of 2016 but was delayed until mid-2017. Construction was substantially completed, with all six lanes open, by August 31, 2017.\n\nOnce widening was completed from Mid-County to Lansdale, a similar project began on the next segment of highway, from Lansdale to Quakertown. As done on the first project, the Lansdale-to-Quakertown segment is being rebuilt in two sections, with a southern half started in late 2017, with widening to 6 lanes and full shoulders. Advance work began in early 2013 with replacement of several bridges in this area north of Lansdale, with work on the actual widening beginning in late 2017.\n\nThe Turnpike Commission has stated its intention of continuing the widening effort past Quakertown all the way north to the Lehigh Valley interchange, milepost 56, although it will take until the late 2020s to get it done.\n\nIn 1990, plans were made to build an interchange at PA 903 in Carbon County. A bill authorizing construction of this interchange was signed into law by Governor Casey in July of that year. Plans for this interchange were cancelled by the turnpike commission in 1995. In 2006, plans for an interchange at PA 903 were resurrected, with the proposed interchange to be all-electronic, in that it will only accept E-ZPass. Construction on the $23 million interchange began in the middle of 2008. The interchange opened to traffic on June 30, 2015.\n\nOn April 28, 2016, plans were announced for a \"Scranton Beltway\" to use I-476 as a bypass for I-81 around the heavily congested segment through Scranton and its suburbs. The turnpike between the two I-81 interchanges carries an average of 10,000 vehicles per day vs. 70,000 on the parallel segment of I-81. This project will build two high-speed connections between I-476 and I-81: one south of Scranton in Dupont and one north of Scranton in South Abington Township. Tolls on the connections will be paid with E-ZPass or toll-by-plate. Construction on this project, which is expected to cost $160 million, could begin as soon as 2021.\n\nHoward M. Sexton, a 70-year-old truck driver from New Jersey, was killed in the southbound Lehigh Tunnel on February 21, 2018, when an electrical conduit broke free from the tunnel's ceiling and fell through the windshield of his truck, striking him in the head. In a preliminary report issued on May 1, 2018, the National Transportation Safety Board revealed that a 10-foot-long section of conduit fell into the path of Sexton's truck after the steel support system for the conduits, which were suspended from the apex of the tunnel arch directly over the travel lanes, failed. The tunnel had last been inspected in 2016, at which time an inspector found evidence of corrosion on several of the steel support straps.\n\nThe old exit numbers (31 and upward) on the turnpike Northeast Extension were a continuation of old exit numbers 1 through 30 on the east-west turnpike. On the east-west turnpike, the interchange with I-476 was old exit 25A because it was between old exits 25 and 26 on the east–west turnpike. \n\n\n"}

He played Gaelic football with his local club Ballygar and was a member of the Galway senior inter-county team from 1956 until 1968. McDonagh later served as manager of the Galway team. He is regarded as one of the greatest Galway players of all-time.\n\nHe is the only man from Connacht with four All-Ireland Senior Football Championship winner's medals.\n\nHe sprung to sporting prominence as a teenager when he starred with Summerhill College, Sligo, where he colleagues remembered him from his striking stature as a youngster. Before he was 18 he has tasted Connacht Colleges glory and also won a Roscommon minor hurling medal with Ballygar.\n\nBig Mattie burst on to the national scene in 1956 when forming the midfield partnership with Frank Evers which provided the possession lifeline for the side which powered their way to a 2–13 to 3–7 All-Ireland final victory over Cork on the day that Seán Purcell & Frank Stockwell ran riot, Stockwell setting a scoring record of 2–05 from play.\n\nAfter the initial flush of success some lean years followed and Mattie had to bear the disappointment of two county final defeats with Ballygar at the hands of Tuam Stars and Dunmore McHales, the later by the narrowest of margins but the best was yet to come.\n\nMcDonagh was one of the most influential players in the Galway teams of the 1960s. After Galway had been beaten by Dublin in the 1963 All-Ireland final where Gerry Davey scored the controversial winning goal, the county under the stewardship of John Dunne, was to embark on their greatest ever run of success, winning three All-Ireland titles, beating Kerry in the first two and Meath in 66 to complete the three in a row, where Mattie McDonagh will be forever remembered in firing home ’left footed’ the only goal of the match in a 1–10 to 0–7 victory.\n\nMcDonagh is the only Connacht player to have won four senior All-Ireland medals\n\nHe never shirked a challenge and took on the task of managing the Galway senior team in 1980 after a turbulent period when player power made the headlines in the county and a cool and respected head was needed to settle the ship.\n\nMattie, although fiercely competitive in every sport, was blessed with an easy temperament which helped him to assuage fears and tensions. One year later he led Galway to what turned out to be their last National League success when routing Roscommon in the Croke Park final although their semi-final victory over Kerry in Ennis was the real highlight of that series.\n\nThe same year he and his charges had to endure the shock of a Connacht championship defeat when Willie Nally and Willie Joe Padden of Mayo \"\"caught all around them\"\" but the following year Galway were desperately disappointed to lose out to Offaly in the 1982 semi-final before going all the way to the final in the infamous decider of 1983 when Dublin edged Galway out.\n\nIn the years after he was always willing to help out with under-age teams and threw in his lot with John Tobin’s minor winning team of 1986 where his experience and cool ahead proved to be an invaluable asset to the management team.\n\nMattie McDonagh died at the age of 68 on April 10, 2005. Tributes poured in from GAA colleagues and officials including GAA President Sean Kelly who said that the Association was greatly saddened by his loss. He was buried in his native Ballygar soil.\n\n\n\n"}

He currently appears as host of \"Kenny Mayne's Wider World of Sports\" on ESPN.com, and he appeared as a weekly contributor to \"Sunday NFL Countdown\" with his weekly \"Mayne Event\" segment.\n\nA native of Federal Way, Washington, Mayne was an honorable mention junior college All-American quarterback in 1978 at Wenatchee Valley College in Wenatchee, Washington. He graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 1982 with a degree in broadcasting. He was the backup quarterback and was ahead of future NFL star Randall Cunningham on the depth chart.\n\nWhile at UNLV, Mayne played football for two years and he later signed as a free agent with the Seattle Seahawks. He has been the manager for the American League team in the Legends and Celebrity All Star Softball Game since its inception in 2001, but in 2010 he elected not to appear in the game. \n\nAfter beginning his television career with a brief stint as a reporter for KLVX-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada, Mayne spent seven years (1982–89) at KSTW-TV in Seattle, Washington. Eventually, he became a weekend sports anchor and weekday news reporter. Mayne resigned from KSTW in 1989.\n\nESPN hired Mayne in 1994 after Mayne had sent ESPN a note inquiring whether the network would hire him. The note simply asked to check a box, including one option that read, \"\"We'll hire you when there's an ESPN5.\"\"\n\nMayne started at ESPN in 1994 as a \"SportSmash\" anchor on ESPN2, then became the anchor of the weekend edition of \"RPM 2Night\" from its start on Labor Day weekend 1995 until August 1997. \n\nOn his final edition of \"RPM 2Night\", Kenny played a phone call he received from David Letterman, then a co-owner of Rahal Racing, that he could not quit doing \"RPM 2Night\". After that, Mayne moved over to the main network. He served, for a time, as co-anchor of the 11PM \"SportsCenter\" with Dan Patrick after Keith Olbermann left ESPN. \n\nHe left \"SportsCenter\" two years later, moving to an assortment of late night ESPN shows which were usually re-aired throughout the next morning. Included in his repertoire was the game show \"2 Minute Drill\". Mayne is now most often seen as the host for ABC and ESPN's horse racing events. He provided offbeat feature stories on \"Sunday NFL Countdown\" in a weekly segment called \"The Mayne Event\". \n\nOn January 17, 2007, ESPN signed Mayne to a one-year contract to do features and cover horse racing, as well as return to \"SportsCenter\" for about 50 shows in 2007.\n\nBeginning October 2, 2008, Mayne starred in ESPN's first scripted web series, \"Mayne Street\", playing a fictionalized version of himself.\n\nIn 2011, ESPN launched \"Kenny Mayne's Wider World of Sports\", a series of videos on ESPN.com highlighting Mayne's trips around the world. In the first season the show visited six countries (England, Ireland, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, and New Zealand) with Mayne participating in events like the King's Cup Elephant Polo tournament in Thailand, the world's longest par-3 hole (Extreme 19) in South Africa, and a road bowling match in Ireland. \n\nA television version of \"Kenny Mayne's Wider World of Sports\", featuring highlights from the internet series, aired on ESPN/ABC in December 2011. Season 2 of \"Wider World of Sports\" featured visits to the Netherlands for canal jumping, Nicaragua for volcano boarding, Italy for the Palio di Siena horse race, Bosnia and Herzegovina for bridge diving at Stari Most, Switzerland for hornussen, and Scotland for the Highland Games. \n\nBoth seasons of \"Kenny Mayne's Wider World of Sports\" have been honored in the Online Film and Video category of the Webby Awards, which annually recognize the best websites, videos, apps, and social media on the internet.\n\nMayne returned to SportsCenter on October 15, 2013 after a five-year absence. A new contract with ESPN signed earlier that month set Mayne to anchor 70 episodes of SportsCenter and host 10 special features per year through 2015. At the time Mayne described the new deal was \"sort of a part-time job\" and implied dissatisfaction with some of the caveats. The deal effectively ended Mayne's role on horse-racing and terminated his \"Wider World of Sports\" series instead focusing his role primarily on SportsCenter. \n\nHe commented on the restructuring of his contract by saying \"for some readers it looked like I had the keys to the place, and they took the keys away\".\n\nDuring his time at ESPN, he has become known for his dry sense of humor. \n\nIn January 2006, Mayne participated in the second season of ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\" with partner Andrea Hale, but after a disastrous cha-cha, Mayne was the first contestant to be eliminated. In an interview with Brian Falvey in the Spring of 2007, Mayne joked that he left the 2006 Rose Bowl at halftime to get up early the next day to practice for \"Dancing with the Stars\". Subsequent seasons have seen Mayne return to the show for \"DanceCenter\", a parody of \"SportsCenter\", alongside former contestant Jerry Rice and judge Len Goodman. \"DanceCenter\" appears on the results show night of the week in which either five or six contestants remain. \n\nMayne was also in the 1998 film \"BASEketball\", which featured the creators of \"South Park\", Trey Parker and Matt Stone. He was alongside Dan Patrick and appeared on SportsCenter to cover the latest \"BASEketball\" playoff competition. In 1999, he played himself on an episode of \"The Drew Carey Show\" entitled \"Tracy Bowl\".\n\nBefore agreeing to the deal with ESPN, Mayne had talks with Comedy Central about doing a sports-themed \"The Daily Show\"-style program and was a finalist to be the host of the syndicated version of \"Deal or No Deal\". He confirmed both discussions.\n\nMayne has recently appeared in commercials for Progressive auto insurance, and Top Flite golf balls. In November 2006, Mayne hosted the pilot episode of the CBS Primetime gameshow \"Power of 10\" which would later be hosted by Drew Carey. \"Power of 10\" producer Michael Davies was impressed with his performance on \"2 Minute Drill\", and wanted him to host one of his other game shows. After Mayne hosted the pilot, he declined the opportunity and it went to Drew Carey. \n\nIn 2008, Mayne penned his first book, \"An Incomplete And Inaccurate History Of Sport\", a collection of offbeat musings on sports and pop culture. In 2010, he appeared in the animated film \"Kung Fu Magoo\" as himself.\n\n"}
{"id": "1817533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817533", "title": "Riser (casting)", "text": "Riser (casting)\n\nA riser, also known as a feeder, is a reservoir built into a metal casting mold to prevent cavities due to shrinkage. Most metals are less dense as a liquid than as a solid so castings shrink upon cooling, which can leave a void at the last point to solidify. Risers prevent this by providing molten metal to the casting as it solidifies, so that the cavity forms in the riser and not the casting. Risers are not effective on materials that have a large freezing range, because directional solidification is not possible. They are also not needed for casting processes that utilized pressure to fill the mold cavity. A feeder operated by a treadle is called an underfeeder.\n\nThe activity of planning of how a casting will be gated and risered is called \"foundry methoding\" or \"foundry engineering\".\n\nRisers are only effective if three conditions are met: the riser cools after the casting, the riser has enough material to compensate for the casting shrinkage, and the casting directionally solidifies towards the riser.\n\nFor the riser to cool after the casting the riser must cool more slowly than the casting. Chvorinov's rule briefly states that the slowest cooling time is achieved with the greatest volume and the least surface area; geometrically speaking, this is a sphere. So, ideally, a riser should be a sphere, but this isn't a very practical shape to insert into a mold, so a cylinder is used instead. The height to diameter ratio of the cylinder varies depending on the material, location of the riser, size of the flask, etc.\n\nThe shrinkage must be calculated for the casting to confirm that there is enough material in the riser to compensate for the shrinkage. If it appears there is not enough material then the size of the riser must be increased. This requirement is more important for plate-like shapes, while the first requirement is more important for chunky shapes.\n\nFinally, the casting must be designed to produce directional solidification, which sweeps from the extremities of the mold cavity toward the riser(s). In this way, the riser can feed molten metal continuously to part of the casting that is solidifying. One part of achieving this end is by placing the riser near the thickest and largest part of the casting, as that part of the casting will cool and solidify last. If this type of solidification is not possible, multiple risers that feed various sections of the casting or chills may be necessary.\n\nA riser is categorized based on three criteria: where it is located, whether it is open to the atmosphere, and how it is filled. If the riser is located on the casting then it is known as a \"top riser\", but if it is located next to the casting it is known as a \"side riser\". Top risers are advantageous because they take up less space in the flask than a side riser, plus they have a shorter feeding distance. If the riser is open to the atmosphere it is known as an \"open riser\", but if the risers is completely contained in the mold it is known as a \"blind riser\". An open riser is usually bigger than a blind because the open riser loses more heat to mold through the top of the riser. Finally, if the riser receives material from the gating system and fills before the mold cavity it is known as a \"live riser\" or \"hot riser\". If the riser fills with material that has already flowed through the mold cavity it is known as a \"dead riser\" or \"cold riser\". Live risers are usually smaller than dead risers. Top risers are almost always dead risers and risers in the gating system are almost always live risers.\n\nThe connection of the riser to the molding cavity can be an issue for side risers. On one hand the connection should be as small as possible to make separation as easy as possible, but, on the other, the connection must be big enough for it to not solidify before the riser. The connection is usually made short to take advantage of the heat of both the riser and the molding cavity, which will keep it hot throughout the process.\n\nThere are risering aids that can be implemented to slow the cooling of a riser or decrease its size. One is using an insulating sleeve and top around the riser. Another is placing a heater around only the riser.\n\nA \"hot top\", also known as a \"\", is a specialized riser, used to help counteract the formation of pipes when casting ingots. It is essentially a live open riser, with a hot ceramic liner instead of just the mold materials. It is inserted into the top of the ingot mould near the end of the pour, and the rest of the metal is then poured. Its purpose is to maintain a reservoir of molten metal, which drains down to fill the pipe as the casting cools. The hot top was invented by Robert Forester Mushet who named it a \"Dozzle\". With a hot top only 1 to 2% of the ingot is waste, prior to its use, up to 25% of the ingot was wasted.\n\nThe efficiency, or \"yield\", of a casting is defined as the weight of the casting divided by the weight of the total amount of metal poured. Risers can add a lot to the total weight being poured, so it is important to optimize their size and shape. Risers exist only to ensure the integrity of the casting, they are removed after the part has cooled, and their metal is remelted to be used again; as a result, riser size, number, and placement should be carefully planned to reduce waste while filling all the shrinkage in the casting.\n\nOne way to calculate the minimum size of a riser is to use Chvorinov's rule by setting the solidification time for the riser to be longer than that of the casting. Any time can be chosen but 25% longer is usually a safe choice, which is written as follows:\n\nor\n\nBecause all of the mold and material factors are the same for n. If a cylinder is chosen for the geometry of the riser and the height to diameter ratio is locked, then the equation can be solved for a diameter, which makes this method a simple way to calculate the minimum size for a riser. Note that if a top riser is used the surface area that is shared between the riser and the casting should be subtracted from the area on the casting and the riser.\n\n"}

{"id": "1817544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817544", "title": "Abronhill", "text": "Abronhill\n\nAbronhill () is an area in the north-east of Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is about a mile or two from Cumbernauld Town Centre. Abronhill was planned with its own shopping centre and has three primary schools, along with several churches. Abronhill has 41 streets. Abronhill, and particularly the now-demolished Abronhill High School, (shut down in 2014 with secondary pupils now attending Cumbernauld Academy), were used extensively as the filming location for Bill Forsyth's 1981 film \"Gregory's Girl\" and its sequel \"Gregory's Two Girls\".\n\nAll of the roads in the older part of Abronhill were named after a tree for example Cedar Road or Oak Road. This is in contrast to other parts of the New Town where historic local placenames or famous Scots or their art were incorporated into the street names.\n\nAbronhill, along with Condorrat and The Village, is one of the parts of Cumbernauld with buildings which pre-date the New Town although Abronhill was very small even compared to those modest settlements. Condorrat, the Village, Arns (near Abronhill see an old map) and Garbethill all had schools in the 19th century.\n\nThe area around modern Abronhill is still mainly farmland and woodland, although there is a new housing estate with 600 homes due to be built to the north of Forest Rd . Palacerigg Country Park and Fannyside Lochs are nearby. There is also a small shopping centre, but this is falling into disrepair which has upset some of the residents. Abronhill has expanded in recent years with the development of Whitelees, which boasts its own primary school and housing estate, and Cherry Avenue which is built on the site of the former Glenhead primary school.\n\nThe name Abronhill comes from the 17th century, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, when the area was named \"Abraham the Hebrew's Hill\" by the Covenanters. The name gradually changed to \"Abram's Hill\" and then to \"Abronhill\". There was a period in Scotland when it was a capital offense to preach at unauthorized religious assemblies so the Covenanters chose meeting places like this hilltop with an eye on escape. Ringleaders caught at these banned meetings would face the boot, or thumbscrews, or worse during the period known as The Killing Time. The death penalty was imposed on those who refused to swear an oath deliberately designed offend their conscience. Field executions were authorized so there were no lengthy trials. Locally covenanters were also reported to have met at Herd's Hill on Fannyside to worship without the king's restrictions. At least two local farmers had all their property confiscated at trials they did not attend.\n\nUntil the New Town's development, the land that is now Abronhill was occupied by farms such as Whitelees, Glenhead, Low Abronhill and High Abronhill. These farms had developed from the Fleming estate; the Flemings were the ruling family in the area, living at Cumbernauld Castle. They acquired the estate after Robert the Bruce murdered the previous laird, Red Comyn. The four original Abronhill cottages were from before the new town arrived. They were built for the workers of the nearby farms, and are situated on the old Slamannan Road which ran from Wardpark through the Glen and all the way to Slamannan. The site can still be found close to Cumbernauld Glen on what's now known as Broom Road. Nearby is the Dovecote (\"Doocot\" in Scots), a 16th-century historical site of interest, which was part of the original Flemming's estate. This received a grant to be renovated from North Lanarkshire's Environmental Key Fund via the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Other local industry which pre-dates the new town includes weaving and mining. Entrances to old mines can be seen at the Glen and other places around the area.\n\nTo the west of Abronhill and separating it from Kildrum is a deep geographical divide called the Vault Glen. Through the Vault Glen runs a river, a pipeline which carries sewage and the railway line. The river, initially called the Glencryan Burn, starts from Fannyside Lochs and runs through Glencryan Reservoir and down to Forest Road, the main road to Abronhill. The river then runs under the road and its name changes to The Red Burn on the other side, behind Cumbernauld Academy. (On older maps the river was sometimes still called Glencryan Burn for part of its way through the Vault Glen). There are four footbridges connecting Abronhill with the rest of the town: one on either side of Cumbernauld Academy, one close to Abronhill Primary School and one at Broom Road. This Red Burn is the one from which Cumbernauld's Gaelic name is derived. There is a gruesome story about how the Red Burn (or Redburn) itself was named. It involves the killing of Roman soldiers whose bodies were dumped in the river at Castlecary making it run red.\n\n"}

As a solo artist, he has placed several songs on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, two of which hit number-one: \"I'll Be Your Friend\" (1992), and \"Mine to Give\" (2000, a collaboration with Photek).\n\nThough electronica has typically been a producer's medium (and the few vocalists who succeed are usually women), Robert Owens became one of the people associated with the late-1980s golden era of Chicago house. Born in Ohio, United States, Robert Owens grew up singing in church, but years later, he was working as a DJ in 1985, when he met Chicago producer Larry Heard. The pair formed Fingers Inc., along with Ron Wilson, and they released a few singles (\"You're Mine\"/\"It's Over\") plus the 1988 album, \"Another Side\".

He succeeded his father Yekuno Amlak.\n\nYagbe'u Seyon served as co-ruler with his father Yekuno Amlak for the last few years of his reign, which eased his succession. A Memorandum in the Four Gospels of Iyasus Mo'a of a gift of vestments and utensils to Istifanos Monastery in Lake Hayq states these gifts were in the name of both Yekuno Amlak and his son Yagbe'u Seyon. He sought to improve the relations of his kingdom with his Muslim neighbors; however, like his father, he was unsuccessful in convincing the powers in Egypt to ordain an \"abuna\" or metropolitan for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. A letter from him to the Sultan of Egypt, dated Ramadhan A.H. 689 (towards the end of AD 1289) is mentioned in Etienne Marc Quatremère's \"Mémoires géographiques et historiques sur l'Égypte… sur quelques contrées voisines\" (Paris, 1811), where he protests the Sultan's treatment of his Christian subjects, stating that he was a protector of his own Muslim subjects.\nMarco Polo mentions that one of the \"princes\" of Ethiopia planned in 1288 to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, following the practice of a number of his subjects; he was dissuaded from this project, but sent his \"bishop\" in his place. On his return leg, this bishop was detained by the \"Sultan of Aden\", who attempted to convert the ecclesiastic to Islam; failing to do so, the sultan then had the bishop circumcised before releasing him. The \"prince\" then marched upon Aden, and despite support from two other Muslim allies, the sultan was defeated and his capital captured. A number of historians, including Trimingham and Pankhurst, identify the ruler with Yagbe'u Seyon, correct Polo's reference to Adal not the Arabian seaport, and name Zeila as the sultan's capital.\n\nAnother incident during his reign was the revolt of Yi'qebene, who attempted to take the Imperial throne from Yagbe'u Seyon. This threat is recorded in Yagbe'u's own words in a note he wrote in the Four Gospels of Iyasus Mo'a:\n\nHistorians are divided over the situation that his successors faced following Yagbe'u Seyon's death. Paul B. Henze repeats the tradition that Yagbe'u Seyon could not decide which of his sons should inherit his kingdom, and instructed that each would rule in turn for a year. Taddesse Tamrat, on the other hand, records that his reign was followed by dynastic confusion, during which each of his sons held the throne.\n"}

He was the son of Emperor Baeda Maryam I by Romna.\n\nDue to his young age, his authority required a regent; a council was formed of his mother Queen Romna, Tasfa Giyorgis (the abbot of the monastery of Lake Hayq), and the Bitwoded Amda Mikael. However, Queen Romna withdrew from this arrangement early on, entering a convent near Debre Libanos where she lived until her death; Abbot Tasfa Giyorgis proved no match for the experienced Bitwoded, and according to Taddesse Tamrat Amda Mikael \"ruled the kingdom almost single handed.\" Betwoded Amda Mikael's rule came to an end around 1486 when a palace coup led by the Emperor's step-grandmother Queen Mother Eleni resulted in his deposition and execution. Queen Eleni thereafter played a leading role in the Emperor's government.\n\nEskender's most significant military accomplishment was sacking Dakkar, the capital of the Adal Sultanate, in 1478; despite this achievement, as he led his army back home, the larger Adal army under amir Muhammad ibn Azhar ad-Din overtook them, killing many of his men and taking many prisoners. Eskender was said to have escaped capture only through the assistance of angels, and afterwards he built a church named Debere Meshwa'e, \"Place of Sacrifice\". There is some disagreement over the context of this campaign. One view is presented by James Bruce, who adds that Zasillus, governor of Amhara, had been commanded to mobilize the forces in the south while Eskender himself raised levies from Angot and Tigray; according to Bruce, Eskender was responding to the predations of Mahfuz of Zeila. More recent scholars, such as Richard Pankhurst, hold that Eskender's sack of Dakkar led to Amir Muhammad to seek peace with the Ethiopians, but he was outmaneuvered by Mahfuz.\n\nThere are also conflicting versions of Emperor Eskender's death, which occurred when he was only 22. One source holds he was killed fighting the Maya, a vanished ethnic group known for using poisoned arrows, east of Enderta. On the other hand, both Bruce and the explorer Richard Burton writes that Eskender was assassinated at Tegulet: Bruce stating that Zasillus of Amhara was responsible, while Burton claiming that Mahfuz had him assassinated. He was buried in the church of Atronsa Maryam, which his father had begun construction on. His early death immediately led to civil war. While the court kept the Emperor's death a secret, one major noble, Zasillus, immediately marched to the royal prison of Amba Geshen, freed Na'od, and proclaimed him Emperor. Another noble Tekle Kristos, who had remained at the Imperial court, championed Eskender's son Amda Seyon II as emperor. Although Tekle Kristos' forces defeated the followers of Zasillus, warfare continued through the realm.\n\nEuropean influence was noticeable during his reign. In a manuscript written by Francesco Suriano (dated to 1482 by Somigli), Suriano describes finding 10 Italians \"of good repute\" residing at Eskender's court, some who had been living there for 25 years. Suriano adds that since 1480, seven more had travelled to the Ethiopian court. They had travelled there \"to seek jewels and precious stones\", but \"since the king did not allow them to return, they were all ill content, although they were all well rewarded, each in accordance with his rank.\"\n\nIt was in the last years of Eskender's reign that Pedro de Covilham arrived in Ethiopia, as an envoy from king John II of Portugal. However, da Covilha was not allowed to return to Portugal, and was forced to live out his days in Ethiopia—although as a trusted advisor to the Emperors.\n"}

He has recorded solo under various names, most notably Mr. Fingers, and was leader of the influential group Fingers Inc., whose 1988 album \"Another Side\" was the first long-form house LP. He is regarded as a pioneer of deep house music, bridging the gap between the futurism and \"posthuman tendencies\" of house and the lush, soulful sound of disco.\n\nBorn on the South Side of Chicago, Heard grew up hearing jazz and Motown at home, and could play several instruments from a young age. Before beginning his solo musical career in 1983, he was the drummer, at the age of 17, in the band Infinity (a jazz fusion cover group that included Adonis). He is sometimes cited as having been a member of the Manhattan Transfer, but Heard has denied this, saying, \"[I] filled in for somebody on one show.\" He also worked for the US government as a benefit authorizer, which enabled him to buy his first pieces of studio equipment.\n\nHeard began producing music in 1984 after purchasing a synthesizer and drum machine; after a few days with the gear, he had recorded three tracks that would later be regarded as landmarks of house music: \"Can You Feel It?\", \"Mystery of Love\", and \"Washing Machine.\" Despite initially not having a connection to Chicago's club scene, he eventually met singer and DJ Robert Owens at a party and the two formed the group Fingers Inc. along with Ron Wilson. The group would release the first full-length house LP \"Another Side\" in 1988. Around this time, Heard also began releasing solo singles as Mr. Fingers on Trax Records and DJ International. At the end of the decade, Trax released \"Amnesia\", which compiled Heard's early tracks; it was released without Heard's permission.\n\nIn 1989, Heard contributed to the debut album by producer Lil' Louis.

{"id": "1817664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817664", "title": "Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)", "text": "Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)\n\nSheriff Andrew \"Andy\" Jackson Taylor is the lead character on \"The Andy Griffith Show\", an American sitcom which aired on CBS, (1960–1968). He also appears in the \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" episode \"Opie Joins the Marines\", made a cameo appearance in the USMC episode \"Gomer Goes Home,\" five episodes of \"Mayberry R.F.D.\" (1968–1971) and the reunion telemovie \"Return to Mayberry\" (1986). The character made his initial appearance in an episode of \"The Danny Thomas Show\" entitled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith.\" In the CBS special \"The Andy Griffith - Don Knotts - Jim Nabors Show\" (1965), Andy and Barney are featured in a musical sketch about their friendship and recreate some classic moments between the characters. Andy Griffith, as Sheriff Taylor, also has a brief comedy cameo in \"Rowan and Martin at the Movies\" (1969), a PSA short subject promoting the purchase of U.S. Savings Bonds. Andy Taylor appeared in all 249 episodes of \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and was played by comedian, musician, and actor Andy Griffith.\n\nAndy Taylor lives in the fictional, sleepy community of Mayberry, North Carolina. Andy is a widower and father to one young son, Opie. In the backdoor pilot episode from \"The Danny Thomas Show\", viewers learn Andy lost his wife when Opie was \"the least little speck of a baby.\" In the first episode of the show Andy has a maid that is getting married and moving away. Andy's Aunt Bee comes in to act as his live-in housekeeper and as surrogate mother/grandmother to Opie. Andy goes fishing with his son and often spends evenings on the front porch strumming his guitar. He sometimes entertains (with reluctance) overnight guests like his Aunt Nora and Uncle Ollie and often has friends in for Aunt Bee's fried chicken dinners. Andy goes to the movies occasionally and to dinner at Morelli's with friends. He enjoys picnicking at Myers Lake and fishing is his favorite pastime.\n\nIn the working world, Andy is Mayberry's Sheriff and Justice of the Peace. He has held the elected job of sheriff since approximately 1952 or ‘53. Andy has a head strong deputy named Barney Fife and, in the color seasons, another deputy named Warren Ferguson. When business is slow at the courthouse, Andy can be found playing checkers with Barney, sitting in front of the barber shop chewing the fat with idlers, playing pranks, or conducting personal errands. He occasionally leaves Mayberry to attend work-related conferences or functions in Mt. Pilot or Raleigh.\n\nAs sheriff, Andy is the chief law enforcement officer in the county, yet most of his activity is in and around the town of Mayberry, and there is no evidence of a separate city police force. Both the town and the county are named Mayberry, so Andy is the chief law enforcement officer for both. These working conditions, plus his reliance on a single deputy (and no clerk or jailer) indicate that the county is very small in both size and population; however, in the episode \"Mountain Wedding\", Andy and Barney get up at four o'clock in the morning to get an \"early start\" on their trip to the Darling's cabin, which is described as being \"up in the mountains\". When they arrive, it is full daylight, so it could be inferred that Mayberry County is larger than originally thought and with mountainous areas, but sparsely populated. Andy and Barney both work the courthouse during daytime hours, and rotate shifts at night. The length of night duties is never specified; however, it appears the only time either spends all night at the courthouse is when a prisoner, other than regular inmate Otis Campbell, is incarcerated. One confusing aspect of Andy's authority however, is his apparent subservience to the town mayor; a plot device which is utilized in several episodes throughout the course of the series - including Season 3's \"The Cow Thief\" - but which makes no sense in real life, since both are elected officials. Additionally, since Andy is elected countywide, while the mayor is a town official, his authority would actually - in most areas - exceed that of the mayor. This apparent dichotomy is never addressed during the run of the show.\n\nIn a 1965 four-part color saga starting with \"Off to Hollywood\", film producers plan a \"fictionalized\" feature film about Andy's sheriffing activities and the Taylors travel to Hollywood to witness the proceedings. The premise of the movie is that Andy Taylor was \"The Sheriff Without a Gun,\" however a 1963 episode \"High Noon in Mayberry\" mentions that Andy has been a sheriff at least since 1952—an occasion when he had to use a gun to wound a robber. In three first-season episodes, \"The Manhunt,\" \"A Feud is a Feud,\" and \"Barney Gets His Man,\" and in one second-season episode, \"Aunt Bea the Warden,\" Andy wears a regular gunbelt. Also, the sixth-season episode, \"Aunt Bee takes a Job\" with co-star Jack Burns, Andy fires a gun (which he borrows from Deputy Warren Ferguson) to disable a car in order to capture some criminals. Andy did have an issued sidearm (a Colt Official Police revolver), but rarely saw cause to carry the weapon. He kept it unloaded on top of a shelf in his house. On the rare occasion he needed a weapon fast, he would grab a rifle or shotgun from the rack in his office or from his car.\n\nAndy is active in the community. He serves on the town council, sings in the civic choir, judges a beauty contest, and acts in a Founders Day pageant. One error here in Andy's community service is his being both the elected sheriff and a town councilmember; under North Carolina law he could not do both. He often serves on social committees, attends community functions like dances, plays with the town band, and participates in organizing high school reunions. He attends church, helps select the church's new organ, and serves on the church's finance committee.\n\nThe premiere episode of \"the Andy Griffith Show\" begins with Andy telling Opie he was raised by Aunt Bee, who is about to return to Mayberry after a five-year sojourn in Morgantown, West Virginia (the real-life hometown of Don Knotts, the actor who portrayed Barney Fife). Being raised by Aunt Bee suggests that Andy was orphaned at an early age, though there is very little evidence offered on the show about Andy's childhood or his family. In one or two instances, old timers remember Andy as a boy. He seems to have no close relatives in Mayberry other than his aunt, his son, and his cousin Barney. In the first two episodes it is stated that Barney is his cousin.\nOther relatives include Bee's sister Nora (who would also be Andy's aunt), who pays a visit in one episode. In another episode, Andy tells Barney that Aunt Bee is heavily against alcohol due to her brother's trouble with the bottle. It is unclear whether this brother is meant to be Andy's father, or one of Andy's uncles.\n\nAndy went to school in Mayberry and graduated from Mayberry Union High. One 3rd-season episode #19 \"Class Reunion\" had Andy and Barney finding their old high school yearbook—the pictures are the actual high school photographs of Andy Griffith and Don Knotts. In the yearbook, Andy's middle name is listed as Jackson. Barney's middle name is listed as Milton. In a later episode, Andy's middle name is Samuel. Over the length of the series, Barney had three different middle names. Andy's first job was working in the movie theater.\n\nIn the first-season episode number nine, \"A Feud is a Feud\", Andy mentions being in France during WWII. This statement is ambiguous, however. At the moment it is uttered, Andy is trying to outwit two mountain men intent on murdering each other. It is possible Andy is simply telling a \"white lie\" to befuddle the two feuders. However, if Andy did indeed see France, he couldn't have seen action on a battlefield because he graduated Mayberry Union High in late spring 1945 and the war in Europe was over in May 1945. He also mentions being in France \"during the war\" in the episode, \"Ellie Comes to Town\". In this instance, Andy is behind the drugstore counter riffing to Aunt Bee about a perfume with a French name, so it could be that Andy is simply being facetious. He also later mentions being in Africa and that he was a First Sergeant. (President Harry Truman declared an official end to World War II on the last day of 1946-thus Andy could have indeed been in World War II but too late to see any action.) Just to make matters more confusing, in Season 6 episode, \"The Return of Barney Fife\", it is claimed that Barney is coming back to town for Andy & Barney's high school class reunion, class of 1948. So evidently the producers of the show did not create a timeline for this character and stick to it.\n\nWhen the show begins in 1960, Opie is six years old and thus his birth occurred in 1954 (the same year in which Ron Howard, who portrayed him, was born). Andy may have married in 1952, the same year he apparently became sheriff. In an episode where Barney tries to find Andy a wife, Andy admits that he misses having a wife to come home to after work. If Andy's wife died the year Opie was born, they may have been married only two or three years. This could explain why Opie was an only child.\n\nAndy was depicted as a country-smart sheriff and a caring, nurturing father. His laid-back approach to law enforcement made him an ideal sheriff for the sleepy town. Andy had his finger on the pulse of the community and Mayberry saw little native crime, with the exception of moonshining. Out-of-town bank robbers, scam artists, thieving vagrants and other crooks frequently passed through the area to practice their evil deeds but were no match for the wise and wily sheriff. Andy is known to have shot only one man in his position as sheriff, which is the key event surrounding the episode \"High Noon in Mayberry\". Apparently, Andy shot the suspect in the leg years ago during an armed robbery; in the latter of the episode, the suspect returns to Mayberry to present Andy with a shotgun as a gesture for having forced him away from his criminal lifestyle, giving him a chance to rethink his life and get back on track. In the episode \"Aunt Bee Takes A Job\", Andy grabs Warren's pistol and fires it in pursuit of two counterfeiters on their vehicle as they are attempting to flee. The sheriff badges worn by Andy and Barney are six point stars; the stars on their shoulder patches have five points.\n\nAndy regularly used reverse psychology on people making them see the error of their ways. He would help transgressors by enabling them to draw their own moral conclusions. Andy had a keen eye for booby traps, and often shielded Barney from both career and social landmines. Andy's pride in and love for his hometown is very evident in his work and his homelife.\n\nEarly shows depict Andy as having a naive demeanor and \"aw-shucks\" personality with home-spun humor which, actually, cover a wise and insightful outlook into people and situations, sometimes catching those who misjudge his intelligence off guard. Barney is often depicted as having grandiose opinions of his ability as a law enforcement officer, resulting in embarrassing situations which Andy wisely covers without hurting Barney's already sensitive nature. In the late 1st and early 2nd seasons, Andy begins to develop moral no-nonsense character traits, which serve in mediation for the problems of other sitcom characters, especially Barney. Later shows, particularly those after Barney's departure, depict Andy as more serious and stressed by the situations arising in each episode; in lieu of his sense of humor from earlier episodes, most of the humor is from Andy's consternation with others.\n\n\"Well, I'll be.\" (Spoken by Andy when he's excited or surprised in a good way.)\n\n\"I appreciate it and good night.\" (Spoken by Andy in the sponsor spots, when he's \"advertising\".)\n\n\"You beat everything, did you know that?\" (Spoken by Andy when Barney makes a bad mistake.)\n\n\"Now, now, Opie.\" (Spoken by Andy when he's trying to explain something to his son, Opie.)\n\n\"Simmer down.\" (Spoken by Andy when someone is overly excited.)\n\n\"That's extry good!\" (Spoken by Andy when someone performs something well.)\n\nWhen the series opens, several years have passed since Opie's mother died. Andy mentions in the backdoor pilot from \"The Danny Thomas Show\" that he lost Opie's mother when Opie was \"the least little speck of a baby\". Opie is 6 years old when the show opens (born in 1954), and it is more than likely (based on Andy's testimony) that Opie's mother died at Opie's birth or shortly thereafter. Andy would have been 27 or 28 when Opie was born in 1954. It is mentioned numerous times during the series that Andy is a widower.\n\nOpie's mother is mentioned only once, briefly, during the show. In the second-season episode, \"Wedding Bells for Aunt Bee\", Opie asks his father if he had the kind of love for his mother that leads to marriage. Andy answers that he did have that kind of love. There are no souvenirs or mementos of a wife seen in Andy's house. All of Opie's relatives seen on the show (Aunt Bee, Aunt Nora, Bradford Taylor) are paternal relations; no relatives of his mother appear.\n\nAndy had several love interests through the show's run, but his first romantic relationship on the series is Ellie Walker (Elinor Donahue), a newcomer to town who works in her uncle's drug store. Ellie made twelve appearances in the first season and then disappeared without explanation to the viewer. (Donahue once stated in an interview that she left because she felt she had no chemistry with series star Andy Griffith. Griffith later admitted that it was his fault because he had a hard time showing affection on screen, and as a result, the relationship did not appear to be real or believable.) source In Season Two, Andy dated a few ladies, including Karen Moore, a cousin of Thelma Lou (only in one episode), and County Nurse Mary Simpson (played by two different actresses Julie Adams and Sue Ane Langdon). In early Season Three, Andy dated Peggy McMillan (Joanna Moore), another county nurse, who chalked up four appearances on the show. In \"Class Reunion\", Andy was reunited with an old girlfriend, Sharon DeSpain. On a number of occasions, Barney meddled into Andy's romantic life and tried to arrange dates for him, which invariably turned out to be ill-suited or embarrassing matches. One of those attempted arranged dates was with the odd, socially inept Lydia Crosswaithe.\n\nThe producers created a long-term love interest in school teacher, Helen Crump. Helen made her first appearance in the third season and remained Andy's love interest throughout the rest of the series. The two were eventually married in the first \"Mayberry RFD\" episode in 1968. The newlywed Taylors remained in Mayberry, and Andy was featured on several episodes of the spinoff series. Andy and Helen returned to \"Mayberry RFD\" for their son Andrew Samuel Taylor, Jr.'s christening in the 2nd-season premiere episode \"Andy's Baby\" (Sept. 1969), in which it was explained that Andy was now an agent for the \"State Bureau of Investigation,\" he and Helen live in Charlotte, where Opie is attending high school. Their departure (and Opie's) is further explained during RFD's 2nd season in the episode \"The Caper,\" when Howard Sprague reads a letter about the family's relocation, explaining that Mayberry now relies on Goober as a part-time Deputy Sheriff and has contracted with the State Police for serious matters. In 1986 the Taylors returned for the made-for-TV reunion movie \"Return to Mayberry\". The movie explained that Andy has retired as Postal Inspector in Cleveland and returned home to see Opie into fatherhood and seek the office of sheriff again. Andrew Samuel Taylor, Jr., wasn't seen or mentioned.\n\nIn polls and editorials, Andy has been routinely ranked as one of the greatest TV fathers, praised for being \"the kind of father that every kid deserves—a kind, understanding and compassionate man with a sense of humor and a load of common sense.\" He placed 8th on TV Guide's list of the \"Top 50 TV Dads\". On the lists created by About.com's Fatherhood section Sheriff Andy Taylor is named the greatest TV father of all time. Tampa Bay Online's public poll also voted him the greatest father in pop culture history, including both television and film, with 82% of the vote.\n\nIn 2018, retired \"Akron Beacon Journal\" writer Rich Heldenfels said he believed Andy Griffith was never nominated for an Emmy because \"just made the acting look too easy\" and because the character was so much like Griffith, \"his timing and other skills did not seem as apparent.\"\n"}

Landmark Theatres is known for both its historic and newer theatres. \nHelmed by COO and president Paul Serwitz, Landmark Theatres is part of Cohen Media Group ().\n\nLandmark Theatre Corporation began as Parallax Theatres which was founded in 1974 by Kim Jorgensen with the opening of the Nuart in Los Angeles, Sherman in Sherman Oaks, The Rialto in South Pasadena, and Ken in San Diego. Steve Gilula and Gary Meyer became partners in 1976 as the chain expanded as Landmark.\n\nIn 1976, the River Oaks Theatre in Houston (which originally opened in 1939) and the single screen Oriental Theatre in Milwaukee were acquired. The Oriental originally opened in July 1927 and was the only standard movie palace ever built to incorporate East Indian decor. The Harvard Exit Theatre in Seattle was acquired in 1979. The film programming in Landmark Theatres was a mix of repertory/revival double-features that changed daily. This mix also included smaller independent and foreign films and allowed Landmark to grow into the largest repertory/revival movie-theater circuit in the nation by the end of that decade.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Landmark reoriented most of their theaters to exhibit first-run specialized, foreign, and re-released classics on longer, open-ended runs. Larger single screens were converted into two or three screen theaters while preserving the external architecture.\nIn 1981, Landmark acquired the Neptune Theatre in Seattle. A year later, Landmark merged with Movie, Inc., from Santa Fe. Movie, Inc., another small company capitalizing on the excellence of foreign, alternative, and classic films. In 1988, The Oriental Theatre in Milwaukee was converted to a triplex by adding 2 theaters underneath the balcony. The original artwork of the main auditorium was left untouched. Additionally, Canal Place Cinema (4 screens) opened on the edge of New Orleans' French Quarter making it Landmark's first new build. 1989 brought a merger between Landmark and the Seven Gables theater circuit from Seattle and Portland. Landmark was purchased by Heritage Entertainment.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Landmark began renovations of its historic buildings, and began developing new multiplex theaters of its own. Landmark was acquired by the Samuel Goldwyn Company in 1990. The new locations included: the Westside Pavilion in Los Angeles, the Embarcadero in San Francisco¹s Financial District, the Embassy in Waltham, MA outside of Boston, the Plaza Frontenac in St. Louis, the Century Center in Chicago and the Renaissance outside of Chicago in Highland Park, IL. In 1998, Landmark was acquired by Silver Cinemas and began operating a small group of discount theaters including: the Bell Road, the Superstition, The Yukon, the Golden Triangle, the Macomb, the Joliet, the Budget South, the East Town Green Bay, the Market Square and the Poughkeepsie theaters.\n\nLandmark was brought out of Silver Cinemas' bankruptcy by Oaktree Capital, allowing the construction and opening of the Sunshine, Bethesda Row and E Street Cinemas. On September 24, 2003, Landmark was acquired by 2929 Entertainment, the Magnolia Pictures¹ exhibition wing folded into Landmark Theatres. Digital Cinema was introduced.\n\nIn 2005, Landmark was the first exhibition circuit to deploy Sony 4K cinema; in-theater digital signage was introduced. In Indianapolis, Landmark opened the Keystone Art Cinema & Indie Lounge. The cinema had 7 auditoriums; the lounge featured plasma televisions and allowed all moviegoers to bring their drinks into the auditoriums. And, the Inwood Theater and Nuart Theater were renovated.\n\n2006 brought the introduction of Vertical integration with the release of BUBBLE by Steven Soderbergh. The film played day-and-date, as it was simultaneously released in Landmark Theatres, broadcast on HDNet Movies and sold on DVD.\n\nIn 2007, Landmark Theatres acquired the Ritz Theatre Group in Philadelphia which consisted of the Ritz East, Ritz at the Bourse and Ritz V. Landmark opened their flagship theater in Los Angeles, The Landmark. Later that year, Landmark also opened Harbor East in Baltimore and The Landmark Theatre, Greenwood Village in Denver.\n\nIn 2008, Landmark held its first live 3D/HD NBA game televised live via satellite to the Magnolia Theatre in Dallas. On March 1, Landmark assumed operation of the 7 screen Gateway Theatre, located in Columbus, Ohio. The theater featured a café, bar, and event space.\n\nThe Shattuck Cinemas in Berkeley received a comprehensive remodel in 2009 including new theater seating, lighting and carpets. Lot 68, a bar and café adjacent to the lobby, also opened its doors inside the Shattuck. Landmark entered the 3D arena with 3 locations operating 3D Projection: the Harbor East in Baltimore, the Tivoli in St. Louis and The Landmark in Los Angeles.\n\nLandmark assumed operation of the Glendale 12 in Indianapolis in 2010 as well as the Olde Town Stadium theater in Arvada, Colorado. In addition, the Piedmont Theatre in Oakland, California was restored, receiving new screens and new auditorium seating in addition to carpets and lighting.\n\nIn Spring 2011, Landmark Theatres was put up for sale, and after receiving multiple bids, was taken off the market.\n\nBeginning in 2012, Landmark continued renovating its theaters. The Uptown, Minneapolis, reopened in its new incarnation on September 14, 2012 which included reserved ticketing and full bar service while still preserving a balcony and a 50-foot tower, originally placed to mark the Uptown area. In October 2012, the Chez Theatre, Denver, and the Magnolia, Dallas, were extensively renovated. Upgrades to the theaters included Barco Digital Projection, upgraded digital sound and leather-style seats as well as The Magnolia Bar, a cocktail suite attached to the theater.\n\nRenovations and upgrades continued at many of Landmark's theaters in 2013. The E Street Cinema in Washington, D.C. opened a bar. The Bethesda Row Cinema, MD, located outside of Washington D.C., was completely renovated in May 2013 with new, reserved seating in all eight auditoriums and a full-service bar featuring local brews and film-themed cocktails. Located in downtown Highland Park, Chicago, Landmark¹s Renaissance Place Cinema was renovated in July 2013 with the addition of a full-service bar and lounge, an expanded concession menu and leather seating as well as two screening lounges. The Embarcadero Center Cinema, located in San Francisco¹s financial district, reopened in October 2013 after an extensive remodel which included reconfiguring the theater space to allow for two more theaters, bringing the total screen count to seven; a lounge featuring a wide variety of wine and beer was added as well as stadium seating and four Screening Lounges with electric recliners. Additionally, the Embarcadero was the first movie theater in San Francisco to feature a new assistive listening system for the hearing impaired. Coils were installed in each auditorium that wirelessly send pure sound to hearing aids that have the 'telecoil,' eliminating background noise and the need for a headset.\n\nOn November 7, 2013, Landmark Theatres announced that they will open an eight-screen complex in Capitol Point, an emerging mixed-use development along New York Avenue in Washington, D.C.\n\nOn January 8, 2014, Landmark announced a six-screen cinema at Atlantic Plumbing, a new mixed-use community at 8th and V Street, also in Washington, D.C.

On December 15, 2015, Landmark acquired the Nickelodeon Theatres, including the Nickelodeon and Del Mar in Santa Cruz, California, and the Aptos Cinema in Aptos, California.\n\nIn December 2016, Landmark opened their luxury theatre The Landmark at Merrick Park located in the Shops at Merrick Park shopping center in Coral Gables, Florida. This was the company's first location and currently only location in Florida.\n\nIn June 2017, Landmark closed their Seven Gables and Guild 45 theaters in Seattle. The official reason was to prepare for renovation, although local media disputes this saying that the theaters are closed for good. In September 2017, Landmark opened their east coast flagship theatre The Landmark at 57 West in Midtown West Manhattan. At the start of 2018, their other NYC location Sunshine Cinema closed.\n\nIn April 2018, it was made public that Wagner/Cuban had put Landmark up for sale.

{"id": "1817669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817669", "title": "Povidone-iodine", "text": "Povidone-iodine\n\nPovidone-iodine (PVP-I), also known as iodopovidone, is an antiseptic used for skin disinfection before and after surgery. It may be used both to disinfect the hands of healthcare providers and the skin of the person they are caring for. It may also be used for minor wounds. It may be applied to the skin as a liquid or a powder.\nSide effects include skin irritation. If used on large wounds, kidney problems, high blood sodium, and metabolic acidosis may occur. It is not recommended in people who are less than 32 weeks pregnant or are taking lithium. Frequent use is not recommended in people with thyroid problems. Povidone-iodine is a chemical complex of povidone, hydrogen iodide, and elemental iodine. It contains from 9% to 12% available iodine (thus 10% povidone-iodine contains 1% avaliable iodine). It works by releasing iodine which results in the death of a range of microorganisms.\nPovidone-iodine came into commercial use in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Povidone-iodine is available over the counter. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 3.30 to 11.40 per liter of 10% solution. This amount in the United Kingdom cost the NHS about £10.86. It is sold under a number of brand names including Betadine.\n\nPovidone-iodine is a broad spectrum antiseptic for topical application in the treatment and prevention of wound infection. It may be used in first aid for minor cuts, grazes, burns, abrasions and blisters. Povidone-iodine exhibits longer lasting antiseptic effects than tincture of iodine, due to its slow absorption via soft tissue, making it the choice for longer surgeries. Chlorhexidine provides similar results, but with equal toxicity concerns.\n\nConsequently, PVP-I has found broad application in medicine as a surgical scrub; for pre- and post-operative skin cleansing; for the treatment and prevention of infections in wounds, ulcers, cuts and burns; for the treatment of infections in decubitus ulcers and stasis ulcers; in gynecology for vaginitis associated with candidal, trichomonal or mixed infections. For these purposes PVP-I has been formulated at concentrations of 7.5–10.0% in solution, spray, surgical scrub, ointment, and swab dosage forms.\n\nBecause of these critical indications, only sterile povidone-iodine should be used in most cases. Non-sterile product can be appropriate in limited circumstances in which people have intact, healthy skin that will not be compromised or cut. The non-sterile form of Povidone iodine has a long history of intrinsic contamination with \"Burkholderia cepacia\" (aka \"Pseudomonas cepacia\"), and other opportunistic pathogens. Its ability to harbor such microbes further underscores the importance of using sterile products in any clinical setting. Since these bacteria are resistant to povidone iodine, statements that bacteria do not develop resistance to PVP-I, should be regarded with great caution: some bacteria are intrinsically resistant to a range of biocides including povidone-iodine. \n\nA buffered PVP-I solution of 2.5% concentration can be used for prevention of neonatal conjunctivitis, especially if it is caused by \"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\", or \"Chlamydia trachomatis\". It is currently unclear whether PVP-I is more effective in reducing the number of cases of conjunctivitis in neonates over other methods. PVP-I appears to be very suitable for this purpose because, unlike other substances, it is also efficient against fungi and viruses (including HIV and \"Herpes simplex\").\n\nIt is used in pleurodesis (fusion of the pleura because of incessant pleural effusions). For this purpose, povidone-iodine is equally effective and safe as talc, and may be preferred because of easy availability and low cost.\n\nThere is tentative evidence that chlorhexidine and denatured alcohol used to clean skin prior to surgery is better than povidone-iodine with alcohol; however, the evidence is not strong enough as of 2015 to determine routine practice.\n\nPVP-I is contraindicated in people with hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) and other diseases of the thyroid, after treatment with radioiodine, and in people with dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease).\n\nThe sensitization rate to the product is 0.7%.\n\nThe iodine in PVP-I reacts with hydrogen peroxide, silver, taurolidine and proteins such as enzymes, rendering them (and itself) ineffective. It also reacts with many mercury compounds, giving the corrosive compound mercury iodide, as well as with many metals, making it unsuitable for disinfecting metal piercings.\n\nIodine is absorbed into the body to various degrees, depending on application area and condition of the skin. As such, it interacts with diagnostic tests of the thyroid gland such as radioiodine diagnostics, as well as with various diagnostic agents used on the urine and stool, for example \"Guaiacum\" resin.\n\nPovidone-iodine is a chemical complex of povidone, hydrogen iodide, and elemental iodine.\nIt is completely soluble in cold and mild-warm water, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and glycerol. Its stability in solution is much greater than that of tincture of iodine or Lugol's solution.\n\nFree iodine, slowly liberated from the povidone-iodine (PVP-I) complex in solution, kills eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells through iodination of lipids and oxidation of cytoplasmic and membrane compounds. This agent exhibits a broad range of microbicidal activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Slow release of iodine from the PVP-I complex in solution minimizes iodine toxicity towards mammalian cells.\n\nPVP-I can be loaded into hydrogels, which can be based on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and gelatin, or on crosslinked polyacrylamide. These hydrogels can be used for wound dressing. The rate of release of the iodine in the PVP-I is heavily dependent on the hydrogel composition: it increases with more CMC/PVA and decreases with more gelatin.\n\nPVP-I was discovered in 1955, at the Industrial Toxicology Laboratories in Philadelphia by H. A. Shelanski and M. V. Shelanski. They carried out tests \"in vitro\" to demonstrate anti-bacterial activity, and found that the complex was less toxic in mice than tincture of iodine. Human clinical trials showed the product to be superior to other iodine formulations.\n\nFollowing the discovery of iodine by Bernard Courtois in 1811, it has been broadly used for the prevention and treatment of skin infections, as well as the treatment of wounds. Iodine has been recognized as an effective broad-spectrum bactericide, and is also effective against yeasts, molds, fungi, viruses, and protozoans. Drawbacks to its use in the form of aqueous solutions include irritation at the site of application, toxicity, and the staining of surrounding tissues. These deficiencies were overcome by the discovery and use of PVP-I, in which the iodine is carried in a complexed form and the concentration of free iodine is very low. The product thus serves as an iodophor.\n\nPovidone-iodine has found application in the field of nanomaterials. A wound-healing application has been developed which employs a mat of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) coated in a monolayer of povidone-iodine.\n\nResearch has previously found that the polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, povidone) can coil around individual carbon nanotubes to make them water-soluble.\n\n\n"}

There are around 3,200 active clubs fielding over 8,500 teams, which are playing on the 7,900 pitches available in the country. Football was first played in Sweden in the 1870s, the first championship was decided in 1896 and the Swedish Football Association was founded in 1904. Despite being a relatively small country population-wise, both the men's and women's national teams and the club teams have gained rather large success from time to time.\n\nFootball, along with other organised sports, came to Sweden in the 1870s and was mainly exercised by gymnastics clubs which exercised most of the sports of the time. England and Scotland were the main sources of inspiration and it is thus not strange that football gained popularity fast, with the first agreement of rules made in 1885 by the clubs active in Gothenburg, Stockholm and Visby. The first international club match was played in 1890 and the first match with modern rules was played two years later in 1892.\n\nThe first association to administer a Swedish national football tournament was \"Svenska Idrottsförbundet\", founded 1895 in Gothenburg, the dominating football town in Sweden, at the time. The association arranged Svenska Mästerskapet in 1896 which Örgryte IS won. The tournament was played until 1925 when the first national league, Allsvenskan, was started. In the late 1890s, the IFK associations began playing football, and by 1901, the first \"Kamratmästerskap\" (IFK championship) in football was arranged.\n\nFootball has grown since and there is currently around 3,300 clubs with 32,700 teams and with one million members, whereof about half a million are active players, altogether.\n\nThe current national league system administered by the football association is organised as 1-1-2-6-12, where Allsvenskan is the highest Swedish level and Superettan the second highest, followed by two third level (Division 1), six fourth level (Division 2) and twelve fifth level leagues (Division 3). Below Division 3 are several lower leagues, in some areas going all the way down to the ninth level, (Division 7), or in the case of Upplands FF, the tenth level (Division 8), overseen by regional football associations.\n\nThe national cup Svenska Cupen is played by all 32 teams from Allsvenskan and Superettan and 64 teams from the lower divisions. Which 64 teams from the lower divisions that get to play is decided by the number of licensed players in the football districts.\n\nThe Sweden national football team played its first international football match in 1908 against Norway. The team has been fairly successful with one 2nd place in the 1958 World Cup, two third places (1950 and 1994) and a victory in the 1948 Summer Olympics. The Sweden women's national football team was once leading in the development of women's football and won the unofficial European Championships in 1984, a success the team has not managed to repeat, however, it won a silver in the 2003 World Cup.\n\nSwedish clubs have appeared in European club competition finals 10 times. In men's football, IFK Göteborg won the UEFA Cup twice, 1982 and 1987, and Malmö FF lost the European Cup final in 1979. In the women's game, Umeå IK won the UEFA Women's Cup twice, in 2003 and 2004, and lost in the final in 2001, 2007 and 2008; Djurgårdens IF Dam (then known as Djurgården/Älvsjö) lost in the final in 2005; and Tyresö FF lost in the final of the renamed UEFA Women's Champions League in 2014.\n\nSwedish football began to have regular seasons from 1924 on, when Allsvenskan started. Before that, tournaments were played irregularly. Svenska Mästerskapet for example, the decider of the Swedish Champions in the early years, was played spring-autumn, while Svenska Serien, the national league, was played autumn-spring. Some years, it was played spring-autumn-spring due to various reasons, and other years it was not played at all due to economical trouble. In 1959, Swedish football changed from autumn-spring to spring-autumn seasons. Allsvenskan has not been suspended any season since its start.\n\nThe last five seasons:\n\nThe current Swedish Champions title is held by the winners of Allsvenskan. The title has existed since 1896, although no club was given the title between 1926 and 1930. The 117 championships have been won by 19 different football clubs so far, with the top four title holders being Malmö FF (20 titles), IFK Göteborg (18 titles), IFK Norrköping (13 titles) and Örgryte IS (12). Clubs from the three largest cities in Sweden, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö have held the title the majority of the seasons, 78 in total, but there is also an example of a very small municipality being able to field a club capable of winning the title, as Åtvidabergs FF from Åtvidaberg held the title twice, in 1972 and 1973.\n\nThe last five holders of the title:\n\nThe following teams have advanced to elimination rounds in the European Cup.\n\nThe following teams have advanced to elimination rounds in the UEFA Champions League.\n\nThe following teams have advanced to elimination rounds in the UEFA Cup.\n\nThe following teams have advanced to elimination rounds in the UEFA Europa League.\n\nUEFA Cup Winners' Cup\n\nThe following teams have advanced to elimination rounds in the UEFA Cup Winner’s Cup\n\nThe following teams have advanced to elimination rounds in the UEFA Women's Champions League or its predecessor, the UEFA Women's Cup.\n\nClub names are current, not necessarily those used when a club competed in a given season. \n\nPrint\n\nOnline\n\n"}
{"id": "1817687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817687", "title": "Sinkang Manuscripts", "text": "Sinkang Manuscripts\n\nThe Sinckan Manuscripts (; also spelled \"Sinkang\" or \"Sinkan\") refers to a series of leases, mortgages, and other commerce contracts written in Sinckan, Taivoan, and Makatao; they are commonly referred to as the \"fanzi contracts\" (). Some are written only in a romanized script, while others were bilingual with adjacent Han writing. Currently there are approximately 140 extant documents written in Sinckan; they are important in the study of Siraya and Taivoan culture, and Taiwanese history in general although there are only a few scholars who can understand them.\n\nThe Sinckan language was spoken by the Siraya people that lived in what is now Tainan. During the time when Taiwan was under the administration of the Dutch East India Company (Dutch Formosa 1624–1662), Dutch missionaries learned Sinckan to facilitate both missionary work and government affairs. They also created a romanized script and compiled a dictionary of the language, teaching the natives how to write their own language.\n\nIn 1625, Maarten Sonck, the Dutch governor of Taiwan, requested that the Netherlands send two to three missionaries to Taiwan for the purpose of converting the natives. However, the first group to arrive were visiting missionaries who did not have the authority to perform baptism rites. It was not until June 1627 that the first real minister, Rev. Georgius Candidius, arrived, upon which missionary work in Taiwan began in earnest. The first area to be targeted, the Sinckan settlement (modern-day Sinshih), had many converts by 1630.\n\nIn 1636, the Dutch started a school for the Sinckan that not only featured religious instruction, but also provided schooling in Western literature. Because the Dutch advocated that missionary work be conducted in the native language, the school was taught in the Sinckan language. The missionary Robertus Junius recorded in his 1643 education report that the Sinckan school had enrolled 80 students, of which 24 were learning to write and 8 to 10 had solid penmanship, while in neighboring Baccaluan (modern-day Anding) school there were 90 students, of which 8 knew how to write.\n\nAside from \"proselytizing\", the missionaries also compiled dictionaries and books of religious doctrine; they translated the Gospel of Matthew into Sinckan and also compiled a vocabulary of Favorlang, another aboriginal language. These would become important sources for later research. The most important Sinckan documents were the contracts between the Sinckan and the Han settlers, commonly known as the Fanzi contracts.\n\nAlthough the Dutch only governed Taiwan for 38 years, they greatly influenced the development of indigenous culture. To take the Sinckan Manuscripts as an example, the latest extant documents in the Sinckan script date back to 1813 (more than 150 years after the Dutch left Taiwan in 1662). This is evidence to show that \"the arts of reading and writing introduced by the Dutch were handed down from generation to generation by the people themselves.\"\n\nShortly after the founding of Taihoku Imperial University in 1928, one of the scholars in the linguistics department, , gathered together a number of old texts in Tainan. In 1931, edited and published them under the title \"The Sinckan Manuscripts\". The compilation contained 109 \"fanzi contracts,\" of which 87 were from the Sinckan settlement; 21 of those were bilingual in Han characters and Sinckan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1817699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817699", "title": "The College of Richard Collyer", "text": "The College of Richard Collyer\n\nThe College of Richard Collyer (colloquially Collyer's ), formerly called Collyer's School, is a co-educational sixth form college in Horsham, West Sussex, England.\nStudents have achieved exam results which enabled a number to progress to universities. The college is rated as being ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted, and is the only further education college in the county to have achieved this.\n\nIt is also the second oldest school in West Sussex after The Prebendal School in Chichester and the fourth oldest school in Sussex. The college is Grade II listed by English Heritage.\n\nCollyer's serves about 1600 students between 16 and 19 years of age. It offers AS and A-level courses in 45 different subjects, including a selection not taught at other local colleges. 20 further subjects are offered towards AVCE, BTEC, GNVQ and vocational certifications and GCSE examinations.\n\nA wide variety of adult education classes are offered at Collyer's in the evenings. It is situated on the B2180 opposite Horsham Community Hospital, and close to the fire and police stations.\n\nThe College was founded in 1532 (Old Style) in the will of Richard Collyer, who was born in Horsham, and became a wealthy member of The Mercers’ Company of the City of London. The Mercers’ Company are still the school's trustees, and maintain a close relationship with the school. Collyer willed that one of his houses in the City, variously called ‘The Sonne’ or ‘The Sunne’, be sold and the proceeds used to build a school-house in Horsham for “”.\nUnder the terms of the will the money was not freed until 1540, and the new school was eventually opened in the early summer of 1541. The education granted to those sixty scholars, who were naturally all boys, was to be provided “freely without any money paying therefor”, with the Mercer's Company paying the masters’ salaries.\n\nThe original building was on the site of the current St Mary's Church of England Primary School, adjacent to the parish church. However, it was extended then rebuilt in 1660, in order to accommodate “neare an hundred scholars ... with diligence and good success” by 1666, such that none of Collyer's original structure survives. (Part of the 1660 building remains in structure of Arun House, in Denne Road.) In the eighteenth century it fell into disrepair, such that the Mercers’ Company surveyor reported that it would cost £1,040 to renovate, “but you will still have a very old and imperfect building.” Accordingly, in 1840 the second building was demolished (save for the part incorporated into Arun House), and a new, late-Elizabethan style structure built for the sum of £2,240.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, the population of Horsham had expanded to 10,000 (accelerated by the coming of the railway and its associated employment), the City and Guilds Institute (which the Mercers' Company had helped found) decreed that education needed to be extended to include the new sciences, and money needed to be found to replace the school buildings yet again. Thus after a long campaign against fees, including a petition of 1,100 signatures, the new school charter of 1889 stated that, “Tuition fees might vary between £4 and £10 p.a. and Boarding fees were not to exceed £40 a year.” A new and larger site was sorely needed.\n\nThe present site in Hurst Road was found, and the current building was designed in 1892 by Arthur Vernon, and built by Joseph Potter for a contract price of £5,795. It is now grade II listed by English Heritage. Above the entrance is a stone engraved with, “Grammar School, Founded by Richard Collier AD 1532”. (Historically the founder's name was often spelled as ‘Collier’, but from the twentieth century it has always been spelled as it is today.) The 1892 building facing Hurst Road has been extended continually as the school has expanded. This included the addition of science laboratories in 1897, a ‘Great Hall’ in 1912, and the ‘New Block’ classrooms in 1932.\n\nIn the 1890s Collyer's taught 110 boys from ages 7 to 17, both boarders and day-schoolers, and for the first time included a sixth form to study for university entrance. From 1923 the Rev. W.M. Peacock started to model the school on public school lines, introducing (among other things) four houses (see below), \"The Horsham Grammar School Magazine\" (later to become \"The Collyerian\"), and a school song. By 1926 it was a single-stream school of 220 boys with a sixth form of “less than a dozen”, and ten teaching staff.\n\nCollyer's ceased to accept boarders in 1935, and the dormitories were converted into much-needed library and common-room space. Plans for adding a gymnasium and other facilities were abandoned in 1939, when the school accepted evacuees from the Mercers’ School in London, and pupil numbers soared to over 400 in three streams. (The accommodation crisis was solved by building hutted classrooms, but numbers continued to rise because of the post-war ‘baby boom’, and the huts were not demolished until the 1980s.) In 1944 it became a voluntary-aided grammar school, and its education was again made available free to the scholars. In the 1950s it had around 500 pupils, rising slowly to over 600 during the 1960s.\n\nIn the early 1960s when an Old Collyerian (OC), Dr. William W. Duckering (1861–1945) bequeathed £22,000 to the school ‘for its general purposes’. The bequest paid for a new laboratory block, gymnasium and changing rooms in 1961, and an assembly and dining hall with theatrical stage facilities, modern kitchens attached, and a ‘Small Upper Hall’ above the new foyer, all completed in 1963. The new hall was named the ‘Duckering Hall’, and the smaller hall the ‘Duckering Room’. (The final phase of building work, to be a new classroom block replacing the World War Two emergency wooden huts, was never undertaken.) Between 1960 and 1963 the playing fields were also extended, levelled, and new sports facilities were added. In 1964 a headmaster's house was built on the site, replacing the accommodation that was originally included in the 1892 school block.\n\nIn the 1960s the then headmaster, Douglas Coulson, left after it was found that he had regularly subjected pupils to canings, and two teachers were imprisoned for indecency. But the school recovered from this low point under its last headmaster, Derek Slynn.\n\nIt started its transition to become a voluntary-aided sixth form college in 1976. The other three state secondary schools in Horsham (Forest Boys, Forest Girls and Horsham High School for Girls) became comprehensives. Collyer's had taken its last first form intake in the previous September, and started to expand its sixth form. Initially this was done by taking students from the two existing secondary moderns to do O-levels, and girls from Horsham High School who wanted to study A-level choices that were not offered by their previous school.\n\nIn the early 2000s, annual reports from the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) have deemed the school outstanding. On the strength of a recent OFSTED Grade One for Science provision, the college was awarded ‘Beacon Status’ for Science in 2005 by the Department for Education and Skills. In the same year, it achieved the status of Centre of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) for sport and recreation. A new £2 million, three storey Learning Resources Centre was unveiled during this period. In 2006 work began to extend the Sports Hall, or Cowley Building, to provide more teaching and social space.\n\nFrom the 1920s the students and some teaching staff in the college have been divided into a number of different houses. All houses names are associated with the history of the college or the town. The current eight houses are:\n\n\nFormer house names include Collyer's, Duckering and Weald.\n\nThe following list of the headmasters from the school's opening until 1965 was provided in the history of the school that was published in that year.\n\n\nIn 1976, the title was changed from Headmaster to Principal. Since then the college's principals have been:\n\nAfter recovering from a country-wide low point in schooling in the eighteenth century, headmasters from William Pirie to George Thompson successively raised standards, such that in 1904, when the school had 110 pupils, six OCs held open awards at Oxford or Cambridge, and another was a City and Guilds scholar. By 1962, university education also having been made free to students, the school sent 55 students out of 80 leavers into higher education.\n\n\n\n"}

He died on 26 November 2003 while in U.S. custody at the Al-Qaim detention facility approximately northwest of Baghdad, following a 16-day period of detention.\n\nMowhoush was commissioned as a heavy transport and airlift pilot officer in 1969 and commanded a wing of An-12 and An-26 heavy cargo planes during the Iran–Iraq War. He was in charge of airlifting logistics operations in the Iraqi Southern Air Command during the Gulf War. He was promoted to brigadier/air commodore rank in 1991 and in 1994 placed in charge of the Eastern Air Command. He was appointed as the commander of the Transport and Strategic Airlifting Command in 1999. He had a total of 3125 hours of logged flying experience on his log from 1969 until 1997 on the An-12, Il-76, and An-26.\n\nU.S. forces initially claimed that Mowhoush had been captured during a raid and that he had died of natural causes, but \"The Washington Post\" later reported that he had given himself up in an effort to secure the release of his sons. Four U.S. servicemen were arrested in October 2004 in connection with the killing.\n\nThe circumstances of Mowhoush's capture, detention and death appear to have been the subject of a campaign of misinformation by U.S. military authorities, who retracted or amended several of their initial claims.\n\nAccording to the \"Washington Post\":\nHours after Mowhoush's death in U.S. custody on 26 November 2003, military officials issued a news release stating that the prisoner had died of natural causes after complaining of feeling sick. Army psychological-operations officers quickly distributed leaflets designed to convince locals that the general had cooperated and outed key insurgents. The U.S. military initially told reporters that Mowhoush had been captured during a raid. In reality, he had walked into the Forward Operating Base \"Tiger\" in Qaim on 10 November 2003, hoping to speak with U.S. commanders to secure the release of his sons, who had been arrested in raids 11 days earlier.\n\nMowhoush died while being interrogated by two soldiers associated with the 66th Military Intelligence Brigade. At first the official military report stated that \"Mowhoush said he didn't feel well and subsequently lost consciousness\". However, when the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal erupted, the Pentagon acknowledged that the autopsy report indicated that the cause of death was \"asphyxia due to smothering and chest compression\", and that his body showed \"evidence of blunt force trauma to the chest and legs\". The Pentagon added that a homicide investigation was underway.\n\nIn October 2004, four arrests were made in connection with Mowhoush's death: Chief Warrant Officer Lewis E. Welshofer Jr., and Chief Warrant Officer Jeff L. Williams, who were the two soldiers conducting the interrogation, and Sergeant First Class William J. Sommer and Specialist Jerry L. Loper from the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment, who were assigned to the detention facility at the time of the interrogation, and who also faced dereliction of duty charges.\n\nAccording to the \"Washington Post\":\nSenior officers in charge of the facility near the Syrian border believed that such 'claustrophobic techniques' were approved ways to gain information from detainees, part of what military regulations refer to as a \"fear up\" tactic, according to military court documents.\n\nThe delay in the arrest of the accused was reportedly a result of their commanding officer, Colonel David Teeples, being reluctant to pursue charges and preferring a simple reprimand. It was not until the \"Denver Post\" ran a series of articles exposing the lenient treatment of the accused that military lawyers commenced prosecution proceedings under military law. Documents revealed during these proceedings confirmed that Mowhoush was physically abused and met his death at the hands of military interrogators:\n\nIt was inside the sleeping bag that the 56-year-old detainee took his last breath through broken ribs, lying on the floor beneath a U.S. soldier in Interrogation Room 6 in the western Iraqi desert. Two days before, a secret CIA-sponsored group of Iraqi paramilitaries, working with Army interrogators, had beaten Mowhoush nearly senseless, using fists, a club and a rubber hose, according to classified documents.\n\nOn January 21, 2006, an American military jury convicted Welshofer of negligent homicide in the death of Mowhoush. A military jury ordered a reprimand and forfeiture of $6,000 in pay, and restricted him to his home, office and church for two months.\n\n"}

Typically it gets worse over time, pain may be present, and sufferers bruise easily. In severe cases the trunk and upper body may be involved. Lipedema is commonly misdiagnosed. \nThe cause is unknown but is believed to involve genetics and hormonal factors. It often runs in families. Risk factors include being overweight or obese. Other conditions that may present similarly include obesity, lipohypertrophy, chronic venous insufficiency, and lymphedema.\nA number of treatments may be useful including physiotherapy and exercise. Physiotherapy may help to preserve mobility for a little longer than would otherwise be the case. Exercise, only as much as the patient is able to do without causing damage to the joints, may help with overall fitness but will not prevent progression of the disease. While surgery can remove fat tissue it can also damage lymphatic vessels. Treatment does not typically result in complete resolution. It is estimated to affect up to 11% of women. Onset is typically during puberty, pregnancy, or menopause.\n\nLipedema is classified by stage:\nStage 1: Normal skin surface with enlarged hypodermis (lipedema fat).\nStage 2: Uneven skin with indentations in fat and larger hypodermal masses (lipomas).\nStage 3: Bulky extrusions of skin and fat cause large deformations especially on the thighs and around the knees. These large extrusions of tissue drastically inhibit mobility.\n\nLipo-lymphedema, a secondary lymphedema, is associated with both lipedema and obesity (which occur together in the majority of cases), most often lipedema stages 2 and 3. \nLipedema is often underdiagnosed due the difficulty in differentiating it from lymphedema, obesity, or other edemas. Many clinicians are unaware of the disease. Trayes 2013 published some tools including tables and a flow chart that can be used to diagnose lipedema and other edemas.\n\nLipedema / Dercum’s disease differentiation – these conditions may co-exist. Dercum's disease is a syndrome of painful growths in subcutaneous fat. Unlike lipedema, which occurs primarily in the trunk and legs, the fatty growths can occur anywhere on the body.\n\nA number of treatments may be useful including physiotherapy and light exercise which does not put undue stress on the lymphatic system. The two most common conservative treatments are manual lymph drainage (MLD) where a therapist gently opens lymphatic channels and move the lymphatic fluid using hands-on techniques, and compression garments that keep the fluid at bay and assist the sluggish lymphatic flow.\nThe use of surgical techniques is not universal but research has shown positive results in both short-term and long-term studies. regarding lymph-sparing liposuction and lipectomy.\n\nThe studies of highest quality involve tumescent local anesthesia (TLA), often referred to as simply tumescent liposuction. This can be accomplished via both Suction-Assisted Liposuction (SAL) and Power-Assisted (vibrating) liposuction. The treatment of lipedema with tumescent liposuction may require multiple procedures. While many health insurance carriers in the United States do not reimburse for liposuction for lipedema, in 2020 several carriers regard the procedure as reconstructive and medically necessary and \"do reimburse\". Water Assisted Liposuction (WAL) is technically not considered to be tumescent but achieves the same goal as the anesthetic solution is injected as part of the procedure rather than before-hand. Developed by Doctor Ziah Taufig from Germany, it is usually performed under general anesthesia and is also considered to be lymph-sparing and protective of other tissues such blood vessels. \n\nComplications include a malformed appearance, reduced functionality (mobility and gait), poor Quality of Life (QOL), depression, anxiety, and pain.\n\nAccording to an epidemiologic study by Földi E and Földi M, lipedema affects 11% of the female population, although rates from 6-39% have also been reported. \n\nLipedema was first identified in the United States, at the Mayo Clinic in 1940. Most attribute the original identification of lipedema to EA Hines and LE Wold (1951). In spite of that lipedema is barely known in the United States to physicians or to the patients who have the disease. Lipedema often is confused with obesity or lymphedema, and a significant number of patients currently diagnosed as obese are believed to have lipedema, either instead of or in addition to obesity.\n\n"}

Pat Brady first appeared on stage at the age of four, in a road-show production of Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. From that initial stage appearance until his death, his life was dedicated to the world of entertainment as a musician and actor, almost exclusively in comedic roles. In 1935, while working as a bassist in California, Pat struck up a friendship with a young country-and-western singer named Leonard Slye, a member of the popular Sons of the Pioneers. When Len Slye was elevated to screen stardom as Roy Rogers, he recommended Brady as his replacement in \"The Sons\". However, as Bob Nolan, an original member of The Sons, was referred to as \"Bob,\" and The Sons thought one \"Bob\" was enough, \"Bob Brady\" then became \"Pat Brady\".\n\nMaking the transition to films himself in 1937, Brady played comedy relief in several of the Charles Starrett Westerns at Columbia Pictures. \n\nBrady served in the U.S. Army and was at the Battle of the Bulge with Patton's Third Army. He was awarded citations and two Purple Hearts.\n\nIn the early 1940s, he moved to Republic, where he played zany camp cook Sparrow Biffle in the Roy Rogers vehicles. When Rogers moved to television in 1951, he took Brady with him. Now billed as \"himself,\" Brady enlivened over 100 episodes of \"The Roy Rogers Show\", usually driving about the sagebrush at the wheel of his faithful jeep \"Nellybelle.\"\n\nLong after the cancellation of the weekly series, Brady continued his association with Rogers on television and in personal appearances. He also rejoined the Sons of the Pioneers in 1959 as a replacement for Shug Fisher, a well-known character actor. In late 1962, Brady appeared with Rogers and Evans in their short-lived ABC comedy, western, and variety program \"The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show\", which lost out in the Saturday evenings ratings to \"The Jackie Gleason Show\" on CBS. Joining Brady on that program was comedian Cliff Arquette in his Charley Weaver role. Coincidentally, Arquette, like Brady, was born in Toledo.\n\nPat Brady died at the age of fifty-seven in Green Mountain Falls, Colorado. At his funeral on March 1, 1972, Hugh Farr and Lloyd Perryman, both members of the Sons of the Pioneers, sang \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" and \"At the Rainbows End\".\n\n\n"}

It is located about 100 miles south of Addis Ababa, on the border between the Regions of Oromia Region and of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region; the woredas holding the lake's shoreline are Adami Tullu and Jido Kombolcha, Dugda, and Ziway Dugda. The town of Batu lies on the lake's western shore. The lake is fed primarily by two rivers, the Meki from the west and the Katar from the east, and is drained by the Bulbar which empties into Lake Abijatta. The lake's catchment has an area of 7025 square kilometers.\n\nLake Ziway is 31 kilometers long and 20 km wide, with a surface area of 440 square kilometers. It has a maximum depth of 9 meters and is at an elevation of 1,636 meters. According to the \"Statistical Abstract of Ethiopia for 1967/68\", Lake Ziway is 25 kilometers long and 20 km wide, with a surface area of 434 square kilometers. It has a maximum depth of 4 meters and is at an elevation of 1,846 meters. It contains five islands, including Debre Sina, Galila, Bird Island and Tulu Gudo, which is home to a monastery said to have housed the Ark of the Covenant around the ninth century.\n\nThe early 20th-century explorer Herbert Weld Blundell describes finding that \"two distinct terraces of former shores rise some 80 feet above the present level, forming a ring round that nearest to the lake on the north, about 4 miles from the shore, marking a former basin.\" The northern shores were covered by papyrus. Weld Blundell includes in his account \"a curious tradition, perhaps suggested by the apparent elevated shore,\" that the lake \"was a kingdom 50 miles across, inhabited by seventy-eight chiefs\", which disappeared in a single night.\n\nThe lake is known for its population of birds and hippopotamuses. Lake Ziway supports a fishing industry; according to the Ethiopian Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2454 tonnes of fish are landed each year, which the department estimates is 83% of its sustainable amount.\n\nThe shores and islands of Lake Ziway are the home of the Zay people. Tradition states that when Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of the Adal Sultanate conquered Ethiopia, the Christians of the area took refuge on its islands. They were later isolated from the rest of Ethiopia by the Oromo people, who settled around the lake. At the time Menelik II conquered the lands around the lake, the lake-dwellers were rediscovered and found to have preserved both their Christian faith and a number of ancient manuscripts.\n\n"}

It allows clipping of a \"subject or candidate polygon\" by an arbitrarily shaped \"clipping polygon/area/region\". \n\nIt is generally applicable only in 2D. However, it can be used in 3D through visible surface determination and with improved efficiency through Z-ordering.\n\nBefore being applied to a polygon, the algorithm requires several preconditions to be fulfilled:\n\n\nGiven polygon A as the clipping region and polygon B as the subject polygon to be clipped, the algorithm consists of the following steps:\n\nIf there are no intersections then one of three conditions must be true: \n\nOne or more concave polygons may produce more than one intersecting polygon. Convex polygons will only have one intersecting polygon.\n\nThe same algorithm can be used for merging two polygons by starting at the outbound intersections rather than the inbound ones. However this can produce counter-clockwise holes.\n\nSome polygon combinations may be difficult to resolve, especially when holes are allowed. \n\nPoints very close to the edge of the other polygon may be considered as both in and out until their status can be confirmed after all the intersections have been found and verified; however, this increases the complexity.\n\nVarious strategies can be used to improve the speed of this labeling, and to avoid needing to proceed further.

In more recent years, author Caroline Myss has suggested that the child, out of the four survival archetypes (victim, prostitute, and saboteur), is present in all humans. According to Myss, its presence ranges from \"childish to childlike longing for the innocent, regardless of age\" and comprises sub-archetypes: \"wounded child\", \"abandoned or orphan child\", \"dependent child\", \"magical/innocent child\", \"nature child\", \"divine child\", and \"eternal child\".\n\nJung placed the \"child\" (including the child hero) in a list of archetypes that represent milestones in individuation. Jungians exploring the hero myth have noted that \"it represents our efforts to deal with the problem of growing up, aided by the illusion of an eternal fiction\". Thus for Jung, \"the child is potential future\", and the child archetype is a symbol of the developing personality.\n\nOthers have warned, however, of the dangers posed to the parents drawn in by the \"divine child\" archetype – the belief of extraordinary potential in a child. The child, idealized by parents, eventually nurtures a feeling of superiority.\n\nEven where impacting less acutely, the child archetype may inhibit psychological maturation and result in an adult who is, in essence, \"Mama's darling\". A man will end up with a strong attachment to a mother figure, either real or symbolic, and will lack the ability to form commitment or be generative. The female version of this, specified as the \"puella\", will have a corresponding attachment to her father figure.\n\nJung was concerned with the possibility of one's over-identification with their own persona, which would turn an individual into a stereotype born of social expectations and ambition, \"unchildlike and artificial\". The child archetype becomes of use in this case, strengthening the individual's link to their past by helping them recall childhood experiences and emotions.\n\nIn its prospective role, the child archetype is a representation of future potentialities and psychological maturation.\n\nThe child archetype is portrayed in media in various ways. It can take the form of a child who displays adult-like qualities, giving, for example, wise advice to their friends, or vice versa (like Raymond in the film \"Rain Man\"). More generally, \"the child star can be conceptualized as a modern manifestation of the ancient archetype of the wonder-child\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1817747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817747", "title": "Johannes Goropius Becanus", "text": "Johannes Goropius Becanus\n\nJohannes Goropius Becanus (23 June 1519 – 28 June 1573), born Jan Gerartsen, was a Dutch physician, linguist, and humanist.\n\nHe was born Jan Gerartsen van Gorp in the town of Gorp, in the municipality of Hilvarenbeek. As was the fashion of the time, Gerartsen adopted a Latinized surname based on the name of his birthplace, \"Goropius\" being rendered from \"Van Gorp\"' and \"Becanus\" referring to \"Hilvarenbeek.\"\n\nHe studied medicine in Leuven, and became physician to two sisters of Charles V: Marie and Eleonore, who were based in Brussels at the time. Philip II, the son of Charles V, wanted him also as his doctor and offered him a rich income. Goropius refused and established himself as \"medicus\" (town doctor) of Antwerp in 1554. Here, free of courtly intrigues, Goropius dedicated himself completely to languages and etymology, studying antiquity and becoming fluent in many languages.\n\nGoropius died in Maastricht, where he was buried in the old friars minor church.\n\nGoropius theorized that Antwerpian Brabantic, spoken in the region between the Scheldt and Meuse Rivers, was the original language spoken in Paradise. Goropius believed that the most ancient language on Earth would be the simplest language, and that the simplest language would contain mostly short words. Since Brabantic has a higher number of short words than do Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, Goropius reasoned that it was the older language.\n\nA corollary of this theory was that all languages derived ultimately from Brabantic. For example, Goropius derived the Latin word for \"oak\", \"quercus\", from \"werd-cou\" (Brabantic for \"keeps out cold\"). Similarly, he derived the Hebrew name \"Noah\" from \"nood\" (\"need\"). Goropius also believed that Adam and Eve were Brabantic names (from \"Hath-Dam\", or \"dam against hate\", for \"Adam\", and from \"Eu-Vat\" (\"barrel from which people originated\") or \"Eet-Vat\" (\"oath-barrel\") for \"Eve\", respectively). Another corollary involved locating the Garden of Eden itself in the Brabant region. In the book known as \"Hieroglyphica\", Goropius also allegedly proved to his own satisfaction that Egyptian hieroglyphics represented Brabantic.\n\nIn spite of his extensive travels in Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Britain, Goropius remained attached to his homeland, and reported on various curiosities and customs from his native region. In his \"Origines Antwerpianae\" (1569), a treatise describing the antiquities of Antwerp, Goropius reports various curiosities, among them that a youth almost nine feet tall and a woman about ten feet tall lived near his home. He also reports that Ters, a deity who seems to have been an equivalent of Priapus, was invoked by Antwerpian women when they were taken by surprise or sudden fear, and that there was a house in Antwerp adjoining the prison of Het Steen that bore a statue which had been furnished with a large worn away phallus.\n\nChristoffel Plantijn had been a friend of Goropius's and the Antwerp-based printing house known as the Plantin Press, which first published Goropius's works in 1569, printed the linguist-physician’s posthumous collected work in 1580 as a massive volume of more than a thousand pages. Goropius's work was met with a mixture of ridicule and admiration. Goropius is considered to have given Dutch linguistics, and Gothic philology in general, a bad name. Though Goropius had admirers (among them Abraham Ortelius and Richard Hakluyt), his etymologies have been considered \"linguistic chauvinism,\" and Leibniz coined the term \"goropism\", meaning absurd etymological theories. Justus Lipsius and Hugo Grotius discounted Goropius's linguistic theories. \"Never have I read greater nonsense,\" the scholar Joseph Scaliger wrote of Goropius's etymologies.\n\n\n"}

Later she began to write short stories, but it was some years before she wrote books.\n\nShe left employment in a government job working for the Ministry of Pensions in order to pursue writing.

He is an assistant coach for Phoenix Rising FC in the United Soccer League.\n\nRamage began his career with Newcastle United as an academy player before progressing to the first team. In the summer of 2008, he moved to London side Queens Park Rangers, thus ending his twelve-year association with Newcastle United. In 2011–12, Ramage spent time on loan at Championship clubs Crystal Palace and Birmingham City before joining Crystal Palace on a permanent contract in 2012. After Palace were promoted to the Premier League, Ramage joined Championship club Barnsley on loan in September 2013. On 3 October 2014 Ramage again joined Barnsley on a three-month loan. In May 2015, Ramage was released by Crystal Palace. He spent the 2015 Indian Super League season with Kerala Blasters before returning to England where he signed for Coventry City.\n\nBorn in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, Ramage is the son of Iain Ramage, a former semi-professional rugby union player and international RFU referee, who was Scotland's representative at the 2003 World Cup. Ramage grew up in Berwick-upon-Tweed, England, but moved to the Newcastle area at the age of twelve and attended Valley Gardens Middle School and Whitley Bay High School. As a youngster, he was with Cramlington Juniors, the local boys' club, and then joined the Newcastle United academy, playing alongside his Valley Gardens schoolmate Steven Taylor.\n\nRamage played in the same youth team as Taylor, Michael Chopra and Adam Rundle under Alan Irvine, before later being coached by former Newcastle players Kenny Wharton and Peter Beardsley. He would later partner Taylor in central defence when they broke into the first team. In the reserve team he was coached by another former United player, Tommy Craig. In March 2003, Ramage won the Jackie Milburn Trophy, given each year to the rising star of north-east football. He worked his way through Newcastle's youth system and captained the Newcastle reserve side before making his breakthrough to the first team squad. Ramage made his first team debut as a substitute in Newcastle's UEFA Cup round-of-16 match second leg against Olympiacos on 16 March 2005.\n\nHis first league start at Old Trafford in the 2–1 defeat to Manchester United on 24 April 2005. He followed this up with several first team starts due to injuries to other defenders in the Newcastle squad.\n\nRamage was a first team regular in the 2005–06 season, appearing in twenty-nine games. The injury to teammate Stephen Carr allowed him to play a larger number of games for the Magpies, as he made a good impression on both Graeme Souness and Glenn Roeder, who replaced Souness as manager in early 2006. As a result of these performances he allegedly caught the eye of former Scotland manager Walter Smith. Ramage is eligible to play for Scotland or England.\n\nRamage only made two appearances in the 2007–08 season, when he was hampered by injury, but also losing out to the new defensive recruits made by the then new manager Sam Allardyce. He was also not to be a first choice of the next manager Kevin Keegan, who replaced Allardyce in the middle of the season.\n\nRamage's Newcastle contract expired at the end of the season, and despite Keegan's stated desire to retain Ramage, he was unable to guarantee first team football, therefore Ramage made the decision to move on.\n\nHe subsequently signed a three-year contract with Championship side Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer. On the opening day of the 2009–10 season, Ramage scored his first professional goal, against Blackpool; he also won the Man of the Match Award.\n\nIn June 2011, Ramage signed a new one-year deal at Queens Park Rangers, however in August, he went out on a month-long loan at Crystal Palace, later extended until 15 January 2012.\n\nOn 29 February, Ramage signed for Championship club Birmingham City on an emergency loan until the end of the season. He made his debut against Leicester City, the team he played on his last appearance for Crystal Palace a few weeks earlier. At the end of the season, Ramage was one of eight players to be released.\n\nRamage signed for Crystal Palace on a one-year contract in August 2012. He scored goals against Leicester City, Leeds United, Watford and Middlesbrough. Ramage was a regular member of the Palace starting eleven over the season, forming a centre back partnership with Damien Delaney, and helped them to promotion to the Premier League. He was given a two-year contract extension, but in September 2013, was allowed to join Championship club Barnsley on loan for the season. On 3 October 2014 Ramage again signed for Barnsley on a three-month loan deal. On 22 May 2015, it was announced that Ramage would not be offered a new contract by Palace at the end of the 2014–15 season.\n\nOn 24 August 2015, Ramage joined ISL side Kerala Blasters FC for the 2015 tournament.\n\nOn 7 January 2016, Ramage signed for League One club Coventry City until the end of the season.\n\nOn 17 March 2016, Ramage joined Leyton Orient on a 28-day loan.\n\nOn 3 August 2016, United Soccer League club Arizona United SC announced that it had signed Ramage.

It was held to nominate the Democratic Party's candidates for president and vice president in the 1852 election. The convention selected former Senator Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire for president and Senator William R. King of Alabama for vice president.\n\nFour major candidates vied for the presidential nomination- Lewis Cass of Michigan, the nominee in 1848, who had the backing of northerners in support of the Compromise of 1850; James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, popular in the South as well as in his home state; Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, candidate of the expansionists and the railroad interests; and William L. Marcy of New York, whose strength was centered in his home state. Cass led on the first nineteen ballots of the convention, but was unable to win the necessary two-thirds majority. Buchanan pulled ahead on the twentieth ballot, but he too was unable to win a two-thirds majority. Pierce won votes for the first time on the 35th ballot, and was nominated almost unanimously on the 49th ballot.\n\nKing was nominated on the second vice presidential ballot, defeating Senator Solomon W. Downs and several other candidates. The Democratic ticket went on to win the 1852 election, defeating the Whig ticket of Winfield Scott and William Alexander Graham.\n\nThe Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts, then an academic institution founded 1825-1826 with a variety of curriculums including mechanical arts along with visual art and design, was located on the second floor of their recently constructed 1851 landmark structure with two clock towers at each end of the long structure set atop arched, stone and brick piers which covered the ancient \"Centre Market\", founded in the 1760s as the original main marketplace of old Baltimore Town. Located at Market Place (formerly Harrison Street) and South Frederick Street between East Baltimore Street on the north and Water Street (old colonial shoreline) to the south. It was also known as \"Marsh Market\" because of the old colonial marsh of Thomas Harrison then located along the western bank of the Jones Falls stream which flowed through downtown Baltimore to the Harbor, and east of \"The Basin\" (today's \"Inner Harbor re-developed entertainment, commercial and hotel area) along the northern shore of the Patapsco River's Northwest Branch. 16th President Abraham Lincoln spoke at the Institute a decade later with his \"Liberty Address\" or \"Baltimore Address\" during the Sanitary Fair to raise money to benefit orphans and widows of Union Army soldiers and sailors, held by the United States Sanitary Commission in April 1864. Old Maryland Institute and the Centre Market buildings perished in the Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904. The Institute's buildings were rebuilt with three new parallel structures here for the marketplace and the second floors for the M.I.'s mechanical arts along with another \"Main Building\" at Mount Royal Avenue in northwestern city in 1906. They were razed in the 1980s for an entranceway into the new Baltimore \"Metro\" subway system, and one building (the old \"Fish Market\") was renovated as the \"Port Discovery\" children's museum, part of the new \"Power Plant Live!\" entertainment complex of the 1990s.\n\nThe convention was called to order by Democratic National Committee chairman Benjamin F. Hallett. Romulus M. Saunders served as the temporary convention chairman and John W. Davis served as the permanent convention president.\n\nAs Democrats convened in Baltimore in June 1852, four major candidates vied for the nomination- Lewis Cass of Michigan, the nominee in 1848, who had the backing of northerners in support of the Compromise of 1850; James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, popular in the South as well as in his home state; Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, candidate of the expansionists and the railroad interests; and William L. Marcy of New York, whose strength was centered in his home state. Throughout the balloting, numerous favorite son candidates received a few votes.\n\nWith a two-thirds majority required to win, Cass led on the first 19 ballots, with Buchanan second and Douglas and Marcy exchanging third and fourth places. Buchanan took the lead on the 20th ballot and retained it on each of the next nine tallies. Douglas managed a narrow lead on the 30th and 31st ballots. Cass then recaptured first place through the 44th ballot. Marcy carried the next four ballots.\n\nFranklin Pierce of New Hampshire, a former Congressman and Senator, did not get on the board until the 35th ballot, when the Virginia delegation brought him forward as a compromise choice, selecting Pierce as their dark horse by one vote over former New York Congressman and Brooklyn Mayor Henry C. Murphy, and then supporting him as a unit. After being nominated by the Virginia delegation, Pierce's support remained steady until the 46th ballot, when it began to increase at Cass's expense. Pierce's support was consolidated in subsequent voting, and he was nominated nearly unanimously on the 49th ballot.\n\nAccording to Edward Stanwood, there was \"no doubt that the nomination of General Pierce was carefully planned before the convention met. The originator of the scheme was James W. Bradbury, then a senator from Maine, a college mate and lifelong friend of Pierce.\"\n\nSource: US President - D Convention. \"Our Campaigns\".

King, to whom Pierce had no objections. King won the nomination on the second ballot. During the ensuing campaign, King's tuberculosis, which he believed he had contracted while living in Paris, denied him the active behind-the-scenes role that he might otherwise have played, although he worked hard to assure his region's voters with the statement that New Hampshire's Pierce was a \"northern man with southern principles.\"\nSource: US Vice President - D Convention. \"Our Campaigns\".

The series ran for eight seasons on CBS between October 3, 1960, and April 1, 1968.\n\nSheriff Andrew Jackson \"Andy\" Taylor is Sheriff and Justice of the Peace of Mayberry. He is genial, good-natured and endears himself to the townsfolk with an air of good will, polite charm and keeps the peace by using common sense. He refuses to wear a gun or formalize his uniform with a tie, as he feels a relaxed image makes him more approachable. Andy is a widower with a young son, Opie, and tries to raise him with good sense and good values. Also in his home is his paternal Aunt Bee who arrives in the home shortly after the previous housekeeper, Rose, marries and moves away. Although a widower, Andy has a steady string of girlfriends, but his longest-lasting relationship is with Helen Crump, Opie's teacher, whom he eventually marries, moves out of Mayberry with, becomes a U.S. Postal Inspector, and moves back to Mayberry and runs for Sheriff.\n\nOpie Taylor is the son of Andy Taylor and his late wife. A good-hearted, normal little boy (about six when the series began), most of Opie's lessons come from his close relationship with his father and his Great Aunt Bee. He is not prone to get into trouble and spends a great deal of time around the jail. At one point, Aunt Bee considers this to be a bad influence, and when Opie runs away from home briefly, she relents and allows him to visit the jail after school on a conditional basis.\nDeputy Bernard Milton \"Barney\" Fife is Deputy Sheriff of Mayberry. Thin, wiry and high-strung, Barney fancies himself an expert lawman even though—in reality—he is actually a bumbling goof. In episodes 001 and 002, Andy refers to him as \"Cousin Barney\". In episode 025, his middle name is said to be \"Oliver\"; in episode 082, his middle name according to his high school yearbook is \"Milton\", in episode 157 (season 5) his middle initial is repeated as \"P\". He considers his position to be essential to keeping Mayberry safe. Even though the town has very little crime, he dubs the town: \"Mayberry, Gateway to Danger\". Andy keeps Barney's crime-fighting shenanigans to a reasonable level, but tries to never step on his ego. Due to Barney's ineptitude with firearms, Andy requires him to carry his service revolver unloaded and only issues him one bullet at a time, which Barney keeps in his shirt pocket until needed. When Barney does load and fire his weapon, he often accidentally shoots into the floor, narrowly missing his own foot. Like Andy, he has a steady stream of girlfriends, but his longest lasting relationship is with Thelma Lou. In episode 028, Barney has just met Thelma Lou at the \"Junction Diner\". In season five, he takes a job as a detective in Raleigh, leaving Mayberry, but returns in seasons six through eight for guest appearances.\n\nBeatrice \"Aunt Bee\" Taylor is Andy's paternal aunt. Aunt Bee is a spinster in her late-50s who raised Andy. She was living alone in West Virginia when Andy invited her to come to live with him and Opie, after their housekeeper Rose got married and moved away. Aunt Bee is a motherly figure who takes the place of Opie's late mother and dotes over the boy, caring for his welfare and taking care of Andy as well. She is prominent in town, a respected lady who spends her time helping with social functions and church events. She is prone to spend time with her friends gossiping about the town's citizens.\n"}

{"id": "1817790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817790", "title": "Blowing up", "text": "Blowing up\n\nIn mathematics, blowing up or blowup is a type of geometric transformation which replaces a subspace of a given space with all the directions pointing out of that subspace. For example, the blowup of a point in a plane replaces the point with the projectivized tangent space at that point. The metaphor is that of zooming in on a photograph to enlarge part of the picture, rather than referring to an explosion.\n\nBlowups are the most fundamental transformation in birational geometry, because every birational morphism between projective varieties is a blowup. The weak factorization theorem says that every birational map can be factored as a composition of particularly simple blowups. The Cremona group, the group of birational automorphisms of the plane, is generated by blowups.\n\nBesides their importance in describing birational transformations, blowups are also an important way of constructing new spaces. For instance, most procedures for resolution of singularities proceed by blowing up singularities until they become smooth. A consequence of this is that blowups can be used to resolve the singularities of birational maps.\n\nClassically, blowups were defined extrinsically, by first defining the blowup on spaces such as projective space using an explicit construction in coordinates and then defining blowups on other spaces in terms of an embedding. This is reflected in some of the terminology, such as the classical term \"monoidal transformation\". Contemporary algebraic geometry treats blowing up as an intrinsic operation on an algebraic variety. From this perspective, a blowup is the universal (in the sense of category theory) way to turn a subvariety into a Cartier divisor.\n\nA blowup can also be called \"monoidal transformation\", \"locally quadratic transformation\", \"dilatation\", σ-\"process\", or \"Hopf map\".\n\nThe simplest case of a blowup is the blowup of a point in a plane. Most of the general features of blowing up can be seen in this example.\n\nThe blowup has a synthetic description as an incidence correspondence. Recall that the Grassmannian G(1,2) parameterizes the set of all lines through a point in the plane. The blowup of the projective plane P at the point \"P\", which we will denote \"X\", is\nHere \"Q\" denotes another point and formula_2 is an element of the Grassmannian. \"X\" is a projective variety because it is a closed subvariety of a product of projective varieties. It comes with a natural morphism π to P that takes the pair formula_3 to \"Q\". This morphism is an isomorphism on the open subset of all points formula_3 with \"Q\" ≠ \"P\" because the line formula_2 is determined by those two points. When \"Q\" = \"P\", however, the line formula_2 can be any line through \"P\". These lines correspond to the space of directions through \"P\", which is isomorphic to P. This P is called the \"exceptional divisor\", and by definition it is the projectivized normal space at \"P\". Because \"P\" is a point, the normal space is the same as the tangent space, so the exceptional divisor is isomorphic to the projectivized tangent space at \"P\".\n\nTo give coordinates on the blowup, we can write down equations for the above incidence correspondence. Give P homogeneous coordinates [\"X\":\"X\":\"X\"] in which \"P\" is the point [\"P\":\"P\":\"P\"]. By projective duality, G(1,2) is isomorphic to P, so we may give it homogeneous coordinates [\"L\":\"L\":\"L\"]. A line formula_7 is the set of all [\"X\":\"X\":\"X\"] such that \"X\"\"L\" + \"X\"\"L\" + \"X\"\"L\" = 0. Therefore, the blowup can be described as\nThe blowup is an isomorphism away from \"P\", and by working in the affine plane instead of the projective plane, we can give simpler equations for the blowup. After a projective transformation, we may assume that \"P\" = [0:0:1]. Write \"x\" and \"y\" for the coordinates on the affine plane \"X\"≠0. The condition \"P\" ∈ formula_2 implies that \"L\" = 0, so we may replace the Grassmannian with a P. Then the blowup is the variety\nIt is more common to change coordinates so as to reverse one of the signs. Then the blowup can be written as\nThis equation is easier to generalize than the previous one. \n\nThe blowup can be easily visualized if we remove the infinity point of the Grassmannian, e.g. by setting \"w\" = 1, and obtain the standard saddle surface \"y\" = \"xz\" in 3D space.\n\nThe blowup can also be described by directly using coordinates on the normal space to the point. Again we work on the affine plane A. The normal space to the origin is the vector space \"m\"/\"m\", where \"m\" = (\"x\", \"y\") is the maximal ideal of the origin. Algebraically, the projectivization of this vector space is Proj of its symmetric algebra, that is,\nIn this example, this has a concrete description as\nwhere \"x\" and \"y\" have degree 0 and \"z\" and \"w\" have degree 1.\n\nOver the real or complex numbers, the blowup has a topological description as the connected sum formula_14. Assume that \"P\" is the origin in A ⊆ P, and write \"L\" for the line at infinity. A \\ {0} has an inversion map \"t\" which sends (\"x\", \"y\") to (\"x\"/(|\"x\"| + |\"y\"|), \"y\"/(|\"x\"| + |\"y\"|)). \"t\" is the circle inversion with respect to the unit sphere \"S\": It fixes \"S\", preserves each line through the origin, and exchanges the inside of the sphere with the outside. \"t\" extends to a continuous map P \\ {0} → A by sending the line at infinity to the origin. This extension, which we also denote \"t\", can be used to construct the blowup. Let \"C\" denote the complement of the unit ball. The blowup \"X\" is the manifold obtained by attaching two copies of \"C\" along \"S\". \"X\" comes with a map π to P which is the identity on the first copy of \"C\" and \"t\" on the second copy of \"C\". This map is an isomorphism away from \"P\", and the fiber over \"P\" is the line at infinity in the second copy of \"C\". Each point in this line corresponds to a unique line through the origin, so the fiber over π corresponds to the possible normal directions through the origin.\n\nFor CP this process ought to produce an oriented manifold. In order to make this happen, the two copies of \"C\" should be given opposite orientations. In symbols, \"X\" is formula_15, where formula_16 is CP with the opposite of the standard orientation.\n\nLet \"Z\" be the origin in \"n\"-dimensional complex space, C. That is, \"Z\" is the point where the \"n\" coordinate functions formula_17 simultaneously vanish. Let P be (\"n\" - 1)-dimensional complex projective space with homogeneous coordinates formula_18. Let formula_19 be the subset of C × P that satisfies simultaneously the equations formula_20 for \"i, j\" = 1, ..., \"n\". The projection\n\nnaturally induces a holomorphic map\n\nThis map π (or, often, the space formula_19) is called the blow-up (variously spelled blow up or blowup) of C.\n\nThe exceptional divisor \"E\" is defined as the inverse image of the blow-up locus \"Z\" under π. It is easy to see that\n\nis a copy of projective space. It is an effective divisor. Away from \"E\", π is an isomorphism between formula_25 and C \\ \"Z\"; it is a birational map between formula_19 and C.\n\nIf instead we consider the holomorphic projection\n\nwe obtain the tautological line bundle of formula_28 and we can identify the exceptional divisor formula_29 with its zero section, namely formula_30 which assigns to each point formula_31 the zero element formula_32 in the fiber over formula_31.\n\nMore generally, one can blow up any codimension-\"k\" complex submanifold \"Z\" of C. Suppose that \"Z\" is the locus of the equations formula_34, and let formula_35 be homogeneous coordinates on P. Then the blow-up formula_36 is the locus of the equations formula_37 for all \"i\" and \"j\", in the space C × P.\n\nMore generally still, one can blow up any submanifold of any complex manifold \"X\" by applying this construction locally. The effect is, as before, to replace the blow-up locus \"Z\" with the exceptional divisor \"E\". In other words, the blow-up map\n\nis a birational mapping which, away from \"E\", induces an isomorphism, and, on \"E\", a locally trivial fibration with fiber P. Indeed, the restriction formula_39 is naturally seen as the projectivization of the normal bundle of \"Z\" in \"X\". \n\nSince \"E\" is a smooth divisor, its normal bundle is a line bundle. It is not difficult to show that \"E\" intersects itself negatively. This means that its normal bundle possesses no holomorphic sections; \"E\" is the only smooth complex representative of its homology class in formula_40. (Suppose \"E\" could be perturbed off itself to another complex submanifold in the same class. Then the two submanifolds would intersect positively — as complex submanifolds always do — contradicting the negative self-intersection of \"E\".) This is why the divisor is called exceptional.\n\nLet \"V\" be some submanifold of \"X\" other than \"Z\". If \"V\" is disjoint from \"Z\", then it is essentially unaffected by blowing up along \"Z\". However, if it intersects \"Z\", then there are two distinct analogues of \"V\" in the blow-up formula_40. One is the proper (or strict) transform, which is the closure of formula_42; its normal bundle in formula_40 is typically different from that of \"V\" in \"X\". The other is the total transform, which incorporates some or all of \"E\"; it is essentially the pullback of \"V\" in cohomology.\n\nTo pursue blow-up in its greatest generality, let \"X\" be a scheme, and let formula_44 be a coherent sheaf of ideals on \"X\". The blow-up of \"X\" with respect to formula_44 is a scheme formula_46 along with a morphism\n\nsuch that formula_48 is an invertible sheaf, characterized by this universal property: for any morphism \"f\": \"Y\" → \"X\" such that formula_49 is an invertible sheaf, \"f\" factors uniquely through π.\n\nNotice that\n\nhas this property; this is how the blow-up is constructed. Here \"Proj\" is the Proj construction on graded sheaves of commutative rings.\n\nThe exceptional divisor of a blowup formula_51 is the subscheme defined by the inverse image of the ideal sheaf formula_44, which is sometimes denoted formula_53. It follows from the definition of the blow up in terms of Proj that this subscheme \"E\" is defined by the ideal sheaf formula_54. This ideal sheaf is also the relative formula_55 for π.\n\nπ is an isomorphism away from the exceptional divisor, but the exceptional divisor need not be in the exceptional locus of π. That is, π may be an isomorphism on \"E\". This happens, for example, in the trivial situation where formula_44 is already an invertible sheaf. In particular, in such cases the morphism π does not determine the exceptional divisor. Another situation where the exceptional locus can be strictly smaller than the exceptional divisor is when \"X\" has singularities. For instance, let \"X\" be the affine cone over . \"X\" can be given as the vanishing locus of in A. The ideals and define two planes, each of which passes through the vertex of \"X\". Away from the vertex, these planes are hypersurfaces in \"X\", so the blowup is an isomorphism there. The exceptional locus of the blowup of either of these planes is therefore centered over the vertex of the cone, and consequently it is strictly smaller than the exceptional divisor.\n\nLet formula_57 be generic homogeneous polynomials of degree formula_58 (meaning their associated projective varieties intersects at formula_59 points by Bézout's theorem). The following projective morphism of schemes gives a model of blowing up formula_60 at formula_59 points:formula_62\nLooking at the fibers explains why this is true: if we take a point formula_63 then the pullback diagram\nformula_64\ntells us the fiber is a point whenever formula_65 or formula_66 and the fiber is formula_67 if formula_68.\n\nIn the blow-up of C described above, there was nothing essential about the use of complex numbers; blow-ups can be performed over any field. For example, the \"real\" blow-up of R at the origin results in the Möbius strip; correspondingly, the blow-up of the two-sphere S results in the real projective plane.\n\nDeformation to the normal cone is a blow-up technique used to prove many results in algebraic geometry. Given a scheme \"X\" and a closed subscheme \"V\", one blows up \n\nThen\n\nis a fibration. The general fiber is naturally isomorphic to \"X\", while the central fiber is a union of two schemes: one is the blow-up of \"X\" along \"V\", and the other is the normal cone of \"V\" with its fibers completed to projective spaces.\n\nBlow-ups can also be performed in the symplectic category, by endowing the symplectic manifold with a compatible almost complex structure and proceeding with a complex blow-up. This makes sense on a purely topological level; however, endowing the blow-up with a symplectic form requires some care, because one cannot arbitrarily extend the symplectic form across the exceptional divisor \"E\". One must alter the symplectic form in a neighborhood of \"E\", or perform the blow-up by cutting out a neighborhood of \"Z\" and collapsing the boundary in a well-defined way. This is best understood using the formalism of symplectic cutting, of which symplectic blow-up is a special case. Symplectic cutting, together with the inverse operation of symplectic summation, is the symplectic analogue of deformation to the normal cone along a smooth divisor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1817852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817852", "title": "Iraqi Air Force", "text": "Iraqi Air Force\n\nThe Iraqi Air Force (IQAF or IrAF) (Arabic: القوات الجوية العراقية, \"Al Quwwat al Jawwiya al Iraqiya\") is the aerial warfare service branch of the Iraqi Armed Forces, responsible for the policing of international borders and surveillance of national assets. The IQAF also acts as a support force for the Iraqi Navy and the Iraqi Army and it allows Iraq to rapidly deploy its developing Army.\n\nThe Iraqi Air Force was founded in 1931, during British control of Iraq after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in WW1, with only a few pilots. Aside from a brief period during the Second World War, the Iraqi Air Force operated mostly British aircraft until the 14 July Revolution in 1958, when the new Iraqi government began increased diplomatic relationships with the Soviet Union. The air force used both Soviet and British aircraft throughout the 1950s and 1960s. When Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979, the air force grew very quickly when Iraq ordered more Soviet and French aircraft. Its peak came after the long and bloody Iran–Iraq War, which ended in 1988, when it consisted of 1029 aircraft of all types (of which 550 were combat aircraft), becoming the largest air force in the region. Its downfall came during the Persian Gulf War (1990–91) and continued while coalition forces enforced no-fly zones. The remains of Iraq's air force were destroyed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nAfter the invasion, the IQAF was rebuilt, receiving most of its training and aircraft from the United States. In 2007, Iraq asked Iran to return some of the scores of Iraqi fighter planes that flew there to escape capture prior to the Gulf War in 1991. As of 2014, Iran was receptive to the demands and was working on refurbishing an unspecified number of jets.\n\nThe Royal Iraqi Air Force (RIrAF) considered its founding day as 22 April 1931, when the first pilots flew in from training in the United Kingdom. Before the creation of the new air force, the RAF Iraq Command was in charge of all British Armed Forces elements in Iraq in the 1920s and early 1930s. The RIrAF was based at the airport in the Washash neighborhood of Baghdad, and consisted of five pilots, aeronautics students trained at the RAF College Cranwell, and 32 aircraft mechanics. The original five pilots were Natiq Mohammed Khalil al-Tay, Mohammed Ali Jawad, Hafdhi Aziz, Akrem Mushtaq, and Musa Ali. During the early years of the Royal Iraqi Air Force, it mainly received aircraft from the United Kingdom as well as Breda Ba.65 attack planes and SM-79 bombers from Italy.\n\nIn the years following Iraqi independence, the Air Force was still dependent on the Royal Air Force. The Iraqi government allocated the majority of its military expenditure to the Iraqi Army and by 1936 the Royal Iraqi Air Force had only 37 pilots and 55 aircraft. The following year, the Air Force showed some growth, increasing its number of pilots to 127.\n\nThe RIrAF was first used in combat against the revolts by tribes in Diwaniya and Rumaytha southern Iraq in 1934 under order of Bakr Sidqi, where it suffered its first combat loss. Its first combat against another conventional military was in the 1941 Anglo-Iraqi War when the Iraqi government made a bid for full independence following a coup by Rashid Ali against pro-British Iraqi leaders. The RIrAF was destroyed as a fighting force, resulting in an alliance with the Axis which involved Luftwaffe aircraft (painted in Iraqi markings) and Italian Regia Aeronautica aircraft assisting Iraqi ground forces. The German units were Special Staff F and Fliegerführer Irak. However losses, a lack of spares and replacements resulted in their departure, following which the coup was defeated by British forces.\n\nA roughly 1946 order of battle for the Air Force can be found in \"Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II\" (p. 48).\n\nThe RIrAF was still recovering from its destruction by the British in 1948 when they joined in the war against the newly created state of Israel in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The air force only played a small role in the first war against Israel. From 1948 to 1949 the 7th Squadron operated Avro Anson training-bombers from Jordan from where they flew a number of attacks against the Israelis. Some of the Ansons were replaced by modern Hawker Fury fighters operated by 1st Squadron, however these aircraft flew only two missions against Israel in Iraqi markings before most were transferred to the Egyptians. Fourteen Hawker Furies had been delivered but by June 7, 1948 only 6 remained operational. Despite these early problems the RIrAF purchased more Furies, acquiring a total of 38 F.Mk.1s single seaters and 4 two-seaters. which equipped 1st and 7th Squadrons. The only Iraqi Fury victory was an Israeli Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the RIrAF was affected when the monarchy was toppled in 1958, resulting in the cessation of arms imports from western countries such as Great Britain. From 1950 to 1958 most of the RIrAF aircraft were from the United Kingdom. The first jet fighters, the de Havilland Vampire, were delivered in 1953. The RIrAF also received de Havilland Venoms and Hawker Hunters during the mid-1950s. In 1954 and 1956, 19 de Havilland Vampire jet fighters and 14 ex-RAF Hawkers funded by the U.S. were delivered. They also received four Bristol 170 Freighters in 1953.\n\nDuring the 14 July Revolution of 1958, the King of Iraq was overthrown and the country established diplomatic and political relationships with Warsaw Pact countries, while simultaneously severing relations with western nations. The Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) dropped the \"Royal\" from its name after the revolution. The Soviets were quick to supply MiG-17s, and later MiG-19 and MiG-21 fighters, as well as Ilyushin Il-28 bombers to the new Iraqi government. They also received 13 Ilyushin Il-14 transports in 1959 from Poland. The first MiG-17s were first delivered in 1958 to replace the de Havilland Vampire. During the late 1960s and or early 1970s additional MiG-17 examples may have been purchased and then forwarded to either Syria or Egypt.\n\nTom Cooper and Stefan Kuhn list the air force's squadrons in 1961 as:\n\nThe IQAF received about 50 MiG-19s during the early 1960s but most of these remained in their crates and were subsequently re-delivered to Egypt and only the 6th Squadron ever operated the (roughly) 18 MiG-19P and missile armed MiG-19PMs, which it did from Rasheed Air Base in Baghdad. Iraq also received MiG21F-13 fighters in 1962 and Tupolev Tu-16 bombers after 1963.\n\nThe November 1963 Iraqi coup d'état realigned Iraq with NATO powers, and as a result, more second-hand Hawker Hunters were delivered to the IQAF. Aircraft imports from the Communist Eastern European nations had been suspended until 1966, when MiG-21PF interceptors was purchased from the Soviet Union after the death in an aircraft accident of Abdelsalam Aref, the Iraqi president, who was then replaced by his brother.\n\nIn 1966, Iraqi Captain Munir Redfa defected with his MiG-21F-13 to Israel who in turn gave it to the United States for evaluation under the code-name \"Have Donut\". However, by then the MiG21-F13s had been replaced by MiG21FL and PFM in the Iraqi air force's frontline units and the MiG21-F13s were being used as operational conversion trainers.\n\nDuring the Six-Day War, the IQAF bombed several air bases and land targets, including strikes by Tu-16 bombers on Israeli airbases. One of the striking bombers was shot down by Israelis, but the rest returned safely. The IQAF also played a significant role in supporting Jordanian troops. As well, the Iraqi Air Force had one Pakistani pilot Saiful Azam who claimed two kills of Israeli fighters over H3 in an Iraqi Hawker Hunter. Iraqi pilots in Hawker Hunters made a further five claims against Israeli planes in air combat. Due to Hunters and MiG21PFMs the IQAF were successfully able to defend their air bases in western Iraq from additional Israeli attacks. On the same day the IQAF also were able to break through Israeli air space and destroyed five Israeli aircraft in air fighting.\n\nThroughout this decade, the IQAF grew in size and capability, as the 20 year Treaty of friendship with the USSR signed in 1971 brought large numbers of relatively modern fighter aircraft to the air force. The Iraqi government was never satisfied with the Soviets alone supplying them, and while they were purchasing modern fighters like the MiG-21 and the Sukhoi Su-20, they began persuading the French to sell Mirage F-1s fighters (which were bought) and later Jaguars (which were however never ordered).\n\nBefore the Yom Kippur War, the IQAF sent 12 Hawker Hunters to Egypt where they stayed to fight; only 1 survived the war. The IQAF first received their Sukhoi Su-7s in 1968; they were originally stationed in Syria. Aircraft deployed to Syria suffered heavy losses due to Israeli aircraft and SAMs. In addition, they were hit with friendly fire from Syrian SAMs. A planned attack on the 8th of October was canceled due to these heavy losses as well as disagreements with the Syrian government. Eventually, all aircraft besides several Sukhoi Su-7s were withdrawn from bases in Syria. During the war in October 1973, the first air strike against Israeli bases in Sinai was composed of Iraqi planes; they hit artillery sites and Israeli tanks, and they also claimed to have destroyed 21 Israeli fighters in air combat. Shortly after the war, the IQAF ordered 14 Tupolev Tu-22Bs and two Tu-22Us from the USSR as well as Raduga Kh-22 missiles from Soviet Union and by 1975, 10 Tu-22Bs and 2 Tu-22Us were delivered.\n\nThe 1970s also saw a series of fierce Kurdish uprisings in the north of the country against Iraq. With the help of the Shah of Iran, the Kurds received arms and supplies including modern SAMs as well as some Iranian soldiers. The IQAF suffered heavy casualties fighting the Kurds, so they began using their new Tu-22s in combat against them (using 3 tonne bombs from high altitude to avoid the Iranian HAWK SAM batteries that the Shah had set up near the Iraqi border to cover the Kurdish insurgents) as they were able to avoid a greater percentage of SAMs due to their higher bombing altitude and improved electronic countermeasures. During the mid-1970s, tensions with Iran were high but were later resolved with the Algiers Treaty.\n\nBetween the autumn of 1980 and the summer of 1990, the number of aircraft in the IQAF went from 332 to over 1000. Before the Iraqi invasion of Iran, the IQAF had expected 16 modern Dassault Mirage F.1EQs from France and were also in the middle of receiving a total of 240 new aircraft and helicopters from their Eastern European allies. When Iraq invaded Iran in late September 1980, the Soviets and the French stopped delivery of additional aircraft to Iraq but resumed deliveries a few months later.\n\nThe IQAF had to instead fight with obsolete Su-20, MiG-21 Fishbeds and MiG-23 Floggers. The MiG-21 was the main interceptor of the force while their MiG-23s were used for ground attack and interception. The Su-20 were pure ground attack aircraft. On the first day of the war, formations of Tu-16/22s, Su-20s, MiG-23s and MiG-21s, for a total of 166-192 aircraft, performed surprise airstrikes on 10 airbases of the Iranian Air Force, succeeding in destroying a large of number of fighter-bomber aircraft on the ground, but not enough to knock the Iranian Air Force out. In retaliation for these aerial strikes, the Iranian Air Force launched Operation Kaman 99 a day after the war was launched.\n\nDuring late 1981, it was soon clear that the modern Mirage F-1s and the Soviet MiG-25s were effective against the Iranians. The IQAF began to use their new Eastern weaponry which included Tu-22KD/KDP bombers, equipped with Kh-22M/MP air-to-ground missiles, MiG-25s equipped with Kh-23 air-to-ground missiles as well as Kh-25 and Kh-58 anti-radar missiles and also MiG-23BNs, equipped with Kh-29L/T missiles. In 1983, to satisfy the Iraqis waiting for their upgraded Exocet-capable Mirage F-1EQ5s, Super Etendards were leased to Iraq. The Iranian oil tanker fleet (see Tanker War) and gunboats suffered severe damage at the hand of the 5 Super Etendards equipped with Exocet anti-ship missiles. One of these was lost during their 20-month combat use and 4 returned to the Aeronavale in 1985.\n\nThe IQAF generally played a major role in the war against Iran by striking airbases, military infrastructure, industrial infrastructure such as factories, powerplants and oil facilities, as well as systematically bombing urban areas in Tehran and other major Iranian cities (later came to be known as the War of the Cities). At the end of the war, in conjunction with the army and special operations forces, the IQAF played a significant role in routing Iran's last military offensive. (by that time, the role of the once superior Iranian Air Force had been reduced to missions in desperate situations only, performing critical tasks such as defending Iran's vital oil terminals). The air force also had a successful role attacking tankers and other vessels going to and from Iran, by using Exocet missiles on their Mirage F-1s. On May 17, 1987, an Iraqi F-1 mistakenly launched two Exocet anti-ship missiles into the American frigate USS \"Stark\", crippling the vessel and killing 37 sailors.\n\nBy 1987 the Iraqi Air Force had a large modern military infrastructure, with modern air logistics centers, air depots, maintenance and repair facilities, and some production capabilities. By that time the air force consisted of 40,000 men, of whom about 10,000 were a part of the Air Defense Command. Its main base was in Tammuz (Al Taqqadum), Al Bakr (Balad), Al Qadisiya (Al Asad), Ali Air Base, Saddam Airbase (Qayarrah West Air Base) and other major bases including Basra. The IQAF operated from 24 main operating bases and 30 dispersal bases, with 600 aircraft shelters including nuclear-hardened shelters, with multiple taxiways to multiple runways. Iraq also had 123 smaller airfields of various kinds (reserve fields and helicopter fields).\n\nUnlike many other nations with modern air forces, Iraq was engaged in an intense and protracted war. The 8 year long conflict with Iran gave the Air Force the opportunity to develop some battle-tested and hardened fighter pilots. Though information about the IQAF is, at best, hard to access, two men stand out as the best Iraqi fighter aces.\n\nMohommed Rayyan, nicknamed \"Sky Falcon,\" who flew MiG-21MF in 1980-81, and claimed two confirmed kills against Iranian F-5Es in 1980. With the rank of Captain, Rayyan qualified on MiG-25P in late 1981 and went on to claim another eight kills, two of which are confirmed, before being shot down and killed by IRIAF F-14s in 1986.\n\nCaptain Omar Goben was another successful fighter pilot. While flying a MiG-21 he scored air kills against two F-5E Tiger IIs and one F-4E Phantom II in 1980. He later transferred to the MiG-23 and survived the war, but was killed in January 1991 flying a MiG-29 versus an American F-15C.\n\nCaptain Salah I. was also a distinguished pilot during this period, achieving a double kill against two F-4Es on 2 December 1981 while he was part of the 79th Squadron.\n\nIn August 1990, Iraq had the largest air force in the region even after the long Iran–Iraq War. The air force at that time had 934 combat aircraft in its inventory. Theoretically, the IQAF should have been 'hardened' by the conflict with Iran, but post-war purges of the IQAF leadership and other personnel decimated the air force, as the Iraqi regime struggled to bring it back under total control. Training was brought to a minimum during the whole of 1990.\n\nThe table below shows the Iraqi Air Force at the start of the Persian Gulf War, its losses, damaged aircraft, flights to Iran and remaining assets at the end of the Persian Gulf War. A portion of the aircraft damaged may have been repairable or else used for spare parts. This is a combination of losses both in the air (23-36 aircraft) and on the ground (227 aircraft) and exclude the helicopters and aircraft that belonged to Iraqi Army Aviation, Iraqi Navy and the Aviation wing of the Iraqi Department of Border Enforcement.\n\nDuring the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi Air Force was devastated by the United States, the United Kingdom and their allies. Most airfields were heavily struck, and in air combat Iraq was only able to obtain four confirmed kills (and four damaged along with one probable kill), while sustaining 23 losses. All of the out of service (six) Tupolev Tu-22s that Iraq possessed were destroyed by bombing at the start of Operation Desert Storm, though they had already been withdrawn from the inventory of the Iraqi Air Force and were simply used as decoys and do not appear on the operational list of lost aircraft from the Iraqi Air Force (like all other old aircraft which were used solely to deflect raids from operational assets).\n\nThe MiG-25 force (NATO reporting name 'Foxbat') recorded the first air-to-air kill during the war. A MIG-25PDS, piloted by Lt. Zuhair Dawood of the 84th Fighter Squadron, shot down a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet from VFA-81 on the first night of the war. In 2009 the Pentagon announced they had identified the remains of the pilot, U.S. Navy Captain Michael \"Scott\" Speicher, solving an 18-year mystery. Captain Speicher, who was a Lieutenant Commander at the time, was apparently buried by nomadic Bedouin tribesmen close to where his jet was shot down in a remote area of Anbar province.\n\nThe second air-air kill was recorded by a pilot named Jameel Sayhood on January nineteenth. Flying a MIG-29, he shot down a Royal Air Force Tornado GR.1A with R-60 missiles. The RAF aircraft serial ZA396/GE was piloted by Flight Lieutenant D J Waddington, and Flight Lieutenant R J Stewart, and crashed 51 nautical miles southeast of Tallil air base.\n\nIn another incident, an Iraqi Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 eluded eight USAF F-15C Eagles, firing three missiles at a USAF EF-111 electronic warfare aircraft, forcing them to abort their mission. In yet another incident, two MiG-25's approached a pair of F-15 Eagles, fired missiles (which were evaded by the F-15s), and then out-ran the American fighters. Two more F-15s joined the pursuit, and a total of ten air-to-air missiles were fired at the Foxbats; none of which could reach them.\n\nIn an effort to demonstrate their own air offensive capability, on 24 January the Iraqis attempted to mount a strike against the major Saudi oil refinery in Abqaiq. Two Mirage F-1 fighters laden with incendiary bombs and two MiG-23s (along as fighter cover) took off. They were spotted by USAF Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft, and two Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s were sent to intercept. When the Saudis appeared the Iraqi MiGs turned tail, but the Mirages pressed on. Captain Ayedh Al-Shamrani, one of the Saudi pilots, maneuvered his jet behind the Mirages and shot down both aircraft. After this episode, the Iraqis made no more air efforts of their own, sending most of their jets to Iran in hopes that they might someday get their Air Force back. (Iran returned seven Su-25s in 2014.)\n\nDuring the Persian Gulf War, most Iraqi pilots and aircraft (of French and Soviet origin) fled to Iran to escape the bombing campaign because no other country would allow them sanctuary. The Iranians impounded these aircraft after the war and returned seven Su-25s in 2014, while putting the rest in the service of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force – claiming them as reparations for the Iran–Iraq War. Because of this Saddam Hussein did not send the rest of his Air Force to Iran just prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, instead opting to bury them in sand. Saddam Hussein, preoccupied with Iran and regional power balance, is reported to have commented: \"The Iranians are even stronger than before, they now have our Air Force.\"\n\nThese included: Mirage F1s EQ1/2/4/5/6, Su-20 and Su-22M2/3/4 Fitters, Su-24MK Fencer-Ds, Su-25K/UBK Frogfoots, MiG-23ML Floggers, MiG-29A/UB (product 9.12B) Fulcrums and a number of Il-76s, including the one-off AEW-AWACS prototype Il-76 \"ADNAN 1\". Also, prior to Operation Desert Storm, 19 Iraqi Mig-21s and MiG-23s were sent to Yugoslavia for servicing, but were never returned due to international sanctions. In 2009, the Iraqi government briefly sought the return of the fighters, but they were disassembled and would have been costly to repair and return.\n\nThe Iraqi air force itself lists its air-to-air losses at 23 airframes compared to the US claims of 44. Similarly, the Allies initially acknowledged no losses in air combat to the Iraqi air force, and only in 1995 acknowledged one loss. After 2003 the Allies acknowledged a second loss, but a further two Iraqi claims and one probable are still listed by the Allies as lost to \"ground fire\" rather than an Iraqi fighter. Generally at least three Iraqi pilots are relatively agreed upon to have scored victories against coalition aircraft in aerial combat.\n\nAs well as the Persian Gulf war, the IQAF was also involved in the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. Alongside Army aviation, Mi-8, Mi-24, Gazelle, Alouette and Puma helicopters were used to counter the attempted Shi'ite and Kurdish revolts between 1991 and 1993.\n\nAfter the Gulf War, the air force consisted only of a sole Su-24 (nicknamed \"waheeda\" in the Iraqi airforce which translates to roughly \"the lonely\") and a single squadron of MiG-25s purchased from the Soviet Union in 1979. Some Mirages, MiG-23MLs and SU-22s also remained in use, with the MiG-29s being withdrawn from use by 1995 due to engine TBO limits, and the MiG-21s withdrawn due to obsolescence. During the period of sanctions that followed, the Air Force was severely restricted by no-fly zones established by the coalition and by restricted access to spare parts due to United Nations sanctions. Many aircraft were unserviceable and a few were hidden from American reconnaissance to escape potential destruction. In patrols of the no-fly zones, three Iraqi MiGs were lost. Despite several attacks from U.S. F-15s and F-14s firing AIM-54 and AIM-120 missiles at the Iraqi fighters, the Iraqi maneuvers ensured they were able to avoid any casualties in their dispute over Iraqi airspace. The last recorded air-to-air kill was on 23 December 2002, when a MiG-25 Foxbat shot down an armed American RQ-1 Predator.\n\nIn 2008, the Defense Technical Information Center released the top-secret archives of the Saddam-era Iraqi Air Force, shedding light on the true losses and operations of the Air Force during 1991.\n\nBy 2003, Iraq's air power numbered an estimated 180 combat aircraft, of which only about half were flyable. In late 2002, a Yugoslav weapons company provided servicing for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s, violating UN sanctions. An aviation institute in Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, supplied the engines and spare parts. These however, were too late to improve the condition of Iraq's air force.\n\nOn the brink of the US led invasion, Saddam Hussein disregarded his air force's wishes to defend the country's airspace against coalition aircraft and ordered the bulk of his fighters to be disassembled and buried. Some were later found by US excavation forces around the Al Taqqadum and Al Asad air bases, including MiG-25s and Su-25s. The IQAF proved to be totally non-existent during the invasion; a few helicopters were seen but no fighters flew to combat coalition aircraft.\n\nDuring the occupation phase, most of Iraq's combat aircraft (mainly MiG-23s, MiG-25s and Su-25s) were found by American and Australian forces in poor condition at several air bases throughout the country while others were discovered buried. Most of the IQAF's aircraft were destroyed during and after the invasion, and all remaining equipment was junked or scrapped in the immediate aftermath of the war. None of the aircraft acquired during Saddam's time remained in service.\n\nThe Iraqi Air Force, like all Iraqi forces after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, was rebuilt as part of the overall program to build a new Iraqi defense force. The newly created air force consisted only of 35 people in 2004 when it began operations.\n\nIn December 2004, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense signed two contracts with the Polish defence consortium BUMAR. The first contract, worth US$132 million, was for the delivery of 20 PZL W-3 Sokół helicopters and the training of 10 Iraqi pilots and 25 maintenance personnel. They were intended to be delivered by November 2005, but in April 2005 the company charged with fulfilling the contract announced the delivery would not go ahead as planned, because the delivery schedule proposed by PZL Swidnik was not good enough. As a result, only 2 were delivered in 2005 for testing.\n\nThe second contract, worth US$105 million, was to supply the Iraqi air force with 24 second-hand Russian-made, re-worked Mi-17 (Hips). As of 2008, 8 had been delivered and 2 more were on their way. The Mi-17s were reported to have some attack capability.\n\nOn 18 November 2005, the Coalition Air Force Transition Team (CAFTT), part of Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq was established to guide the recreation of the new Iraqi Air Force. During this period, the Air Force primarily served as a light reconnaissance and transport operation. A report of February 2006 detailed the 3rd, 23rd, and 70th Squadrons busy on these missions. The air force also included the IAF Operational Air Headquarters in Baghdad with a major-general commanding and just over 100 staff in staff cells A1-A6, and A7 (Training), A8 (Finance) and A9 (Engineering); the two reconnaissance squadrons (3rd and 70th); 2nd and 4th Squadrons planned to receive Huey II helicopters; 12th Squadron with Bell JetRangers (training) and 15th Squadron due to receive Mi-17 helicopters in early 2006, all at Taji Air Base; and 23rd Squadron flying the C-130s.\n\nOn March 4, 2007, the air force carried out its first medical evacuation in the city of Baghdad when an injured police officer was airlifted to a hospital. Also in 2007, the USAF's Second Air Force, part of Air Education and Training Command, was given responsibility to provide curricula and advice to the Iraqi Air Force as it stood up its own technical training and branch specific basic training among others.\n\nDuring the Battle of Basra (2008) the Iraqi Air Force planned, executed, and monitored 104 missions in support of Iraqi ground security forces in Basra during Operation Charge of the Knights in the Basra area between March 25 and April 1.\n\nIn 2009 the first of several Iraqi officers completed their flying training at RAF Cranwell, a development with echos of the Iraqi Air Force's early beginnings.\n\nIt was reported in December 2007 that a deal had been reached between the Iraqi government and Serbia for the sale of arms and other military equipment including 36 Lasta 95 basic trainers. It was speculated that Iraq might buy 50 Aérospatiale Gazelle attack helicopters from France. In July 2008, Iraq had formally requested an order for 24 light attack and reconnaissance helicopters. The aircraft would either be the U.S. Army's new ARH-70 helicopter or the MH-6 Little Bird.\n\nOn October 14, 2008, \"Aviation Week\" reported that two Hellfire-equipped Cessna 208Bs were spotted at an ATK facility in Meacham Airport, Fort Worth, Texas. The Iraqi air force was due to receive 3 armed Cessna 208Bs in December 2008, with two more to be delivered in 2009. This represented the first IQAF strike capability since the start of the war in 2003.\nThe Iraqi government announced in November 2008 that the Iraqi Air Force would purchase 108 aircraft through 2011. Ultimately the force was to have consisted of up to 516 total aircraft by 2015, then 550 total aircraft by 2018. Specific types being purchased included Eurocopter EC635 and Bell ARH-70 type helicopters. Additionally, 24 T-6 Texan II aircraft would be purchased for the light attack role.\n\nOver the summer of 2008, the Defense Department announced that the Iraqi government wanted to order more than 400 armored vehicles and other equipment worth up to $3 billion, and six C-130J transport planes, worth up to $1.5 billion.\n\nIraq was due to buy 28 Czech-made L-159 training jets valued at $1 billion (770 million euros). Twenty-four of the planes would be new, while four would come from Czech surplus stocks. Later the deal fell through. However afterwards the Czech aviation company Aero Vodochody reportedly agreed to sell 12 of the jets, although the deal wasn't yet approved by both countries' governments. There were talks to buy Czech made combat aircraft Aero L-159 Alca with possible sale or oil trade of either 24 or 36 aircraft from Czech Air Force surplus. The purchase was not done and as of 2013, the Czech Republic has not been able to secure its first export deal for its L-159 Alca fighter aircraft. The deal for 24/36 Czech L-159 aircraft was cancelled; instead South Korea supersonic KAI T50 have been chosen (24 aircraft). But in April 2014, Iraq decided to buy 12 second-hand (conserved) L-159 for $200 million.\n\nThroughout 2010 and 2011, the Iraqi government and the MoI announced intentions to buy Dassault Mirage F1 and F-16C Block 52 fighters. The Iraqi cabinet specified a sum of $900m as a first installment of $3b worth of aircraft, equipment, spare parts, and training.\n\nThe deal to buy the F-16 fighters seemed to teeter as the GoI reversed its decision on the 12th of February and wanted to divert the initial sum of $900m to economic reconstruction. However, on the 12 July 2011, the GoI re-iterated its interest in the F-16s due to the pending withdrawal of American forces from Iraq, and later the number of fighters to be purchased was doubled to 36.\n\nIraq's air space was unguarded from December 2011 until 18 F-16IQ Block 52 jet fighters and their pilots were ready. The first Iraqi F-16 made its inaugural flight in May 2014. It was officially delivered to the IQAF in a ceremony at Fort Worth, Texas on 5 June 2014.\n\nIn October 2012, it was reported that Russia and Iraq may sign a $4.2–$5.0 billion weapons contract, including 30 Mi-28N helicopters. The deal was confirmed on 9 October. The deal was reportedly cancelled due to Iraqi concerns of corruption, but that concern was addressed, and the Iraqi defense minister stated that \"the deal is going ahead.\" Despite early complications, all parts of the $4.2 billion contracts were signed, and are being executed. The first contract for 10 Mi-28NE helicopters for Iraq will begin delivery in September 2013. A batch of 13 Mi-28NE helicopters was delivered in January 2014.\n\nOn 26 June 2014, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said that they \"should have sought to buy other jet fighters like British, French and Russian\", describing the order of American F-16s as \"long-winded\" and \"deluded\". The IQAF instead acquired second-hand jet aircraft from Russia and Belarus to combat ISIS militants in Northern Iraq, with the first batch arriving on 28 June. The Iraqi Ministry of Defense confirmed the purchase of 5 Russian Sukhoi Su-25, uploading a video on its YouTube channel of their arrival. The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force also delivered seven Su-25s on 1 July, the majority of which were ex-Iraqi aircraft that fled to Iran during the Gulf War.\n\nOn 13 July 2015, the Iraqi Air Force received its first batch of F-16 fighters. In addition to the F-16's which are due to be delivered to the Iraqi Air Force throughout the upcoming years, 24 KAI T-50 Golden Eagles are expected to begin deliveries by April 2016 boosting the Iraqi Air Force's defense capabilities. On 5 November 2015, the first two Czech Aero L-159 light combat aircraft were delivered to Iraq. The first group of Iraqi pilots completed training in the Czech company Aero Vodochody on 9 February 2016. Iraq will gain a total of 15 Aero L-159s and Aero Vodochody will make 12 aircraft operable for the Iraqi Air Force. Two other planes will be used for the reconstruction of two aircraft into two-seaters, one will be used for spare parts. For nearly three years, United Kingdom has blocked the sale of L-159s because they contain British radar warning receiver. However, Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to overturn the ban in February 2016 and the sale to Iraq is proceeding.\n\nIn December 2014, during a meeting between leaders of Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, the UAE offered up to 10 Mirage 2000 fighters to the Iraqi Air Force. The aircraft could have been delivered by March 2015.\n\nOn 6-7, April 2019, IqAF received six new F-16s. According to Brigadier Yahya Rasool, Ministry of Defence (Iraq)'s Security Media Cell spokesperson, the latest delivery brings Iraq's F-16 fleet to 27.\n\nAmong operating squadrons of the air force today are: 3rd Squadron; 9th Squadron (F-16s); 23rd Squadron; 70th Squadron; 87th Squadron (B 350ER); 109th Squadron (Sukhoi Su-25); 115th Squadron (L-159); and possibly 2nd Squadron.\n\n\n\nIraq Air Force Officer rank insignia in use today are shown in the following table:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1817874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817874", "title": "Integral yoga", "text": "Integral yoga\n\nIntegral yoga, also called supramental yoga, is the yoga-based philosophy and practice of Sri Aurobindo and \"The Mother\" (Mirra Alfassa). Sri Aurobindo finds that there has always been impulse or longings in humans in search for God, Light, Bliss, Freedom, Immortality which has presented itself in a right place in a sequence, which Nature is seeking to evolve beyond mind. This sequence on one end which depicts Life is already involved in Matter (or Matter a form of veiled life, i.e. life being evolved out of matter) and mind in life (i.e. mind being evolved out of life), leading to the understanding that currently the mind is also a veil of higher states which are beyond mind. Nature via the said impulses would gradually prepare for a higher living and a diviner life. \nIntegral yoga finds all life conscious or unconscious a yoga, defines the term yoga as a methodised effort towards self-perfection by the expression of the secret potentialities latent in the being and highest condition of victory in that effort—a union of the human individual with the universal and transcendent existence which is seen partially as expressions in humans and in the cosmos.\n\nAccording to Sri Aurobindo, the current status of human evolution is an intermediate stage in the evolution of being, which is on its way to the unfolding of the spirit, and the self-revelation of divinity in all things. Yoga is a rapid and concentrated evolution of being, which can take effect in one life-time, while unassisted natural evolution would take many centuries or many births. Sri Aurobindo suggests a grand representation of future potentialities called sapta chatushtaya (seven quadrates), which depicts a road map to coming evolution.\n\nThe two common perception of Life and Reality\nSri Aurobindo finds that there are two extreme views of life, the materialists and the ascetics.\n\nHe finds materialists would only accept the existence of matter or force and deny anything else, & would in their argument find anything which is not knowable (that which would escape once thought and speech) as inert or a passive, silent Atman, an illusion or a hallucination, this affirmation by the materialists is based on the association of the real with the materially perceptible, and becomes the basis of his assumption on all his arguments. For which Sri Aurobindo finds that the notion cannot give an impartial reasoning. Due to the above notion the materialists would refuse any further inquiry, thus never would have a satisfied understanding. He recommends that the only way to reconcile the materialistic mind with the other truth would be to cross over the layers of inner consciousness either by objective analysis of life & mind as to matter or by subjective synthesis and illumination, arrive at a state of the ultimate unity without denying the energy of the expressing multiplicity of the universe.\n\nHe finds that the current World is in a state of rationalistic materialism, & finds that this rationalistic movement has served human kind in a positive way, by purifying intellect from the dogmas, superstitions clearing path to a better advancement of Humanity. Sri Aurobindo finds that root of this Scientific movement to be a search for knowledge, due to this root the movement would not come to a halt and its progress is a sure sign that it would carry forward in reaching the other part of knowledge which vedantins had found in a different way.\n\nwould only accept spirit/Atman and terming the remaining as mechanical unintelligent substance or energy, leading to believing the reality to be an illusion of senses. Sri Aurobindo finds when the mind retracts from external activities and has experience of silence, a powerful convincing experience that only the pure self or non-being is real, leads them to disregard the outer world. \nhe finds this as a revolt of spirit on matter which was made famous by Buddhism, which affirms that it is impossible to find a solution in the world which is termed to be dual in nature, but to escape into Nirvana, Brahmaloka or Goloka as beyond & a final solution. He finds that this approach is slowly coming to an end and had its importance as the part of evolution, but the said approach is quite different than what was present during Vedic period.\n\nSri Aurobindo finds that a compromise between the two approaches would be a bargain and would not be a true reconciliation, but only a unified Spirit and Matter would be a basis for Integral yoga's path to understanding of reality. He finds that the non being at one end which seems opposite to the manifested universe, are not opposites which would deny other's existence, but rather are different states of reality with opposite affirmations. Sri Aurobindo finds that the highest experience of the Reality to be a conscious Existence, a supreme Intelligence, Force and a self-existent Bliss; He finds a liberated intelligence and experience would bring about this highest understanding of the reality.\n\nIntegral yoga rejects notion of reality being a purposeless illusion or a result of an accident nor a deceptive trick of mind but an existence aware of itself, realises itself in form and unfolds itself in the individual, an existence which already exists as an all-revealing & all-guiding truth of things first movements would be without the knowledge of its conscious mind but a general movement of nature and later consciously by a progressive awakening & self enlargement, to his divine ascension and finds this ascent of life to divine life is the human journey and his prime purpose of life.\n\nSri Aurobindo finds an allegory of Adam and Eve in the Genesis, representing Purusha (the individual Soul) tempted by prakriti (nature) having consumed a fruit which represents a dividing consciousness, brings in dualities of life and death, good and evil which has caused a fall, a deviation from full and pure acceptance of God. The redemption would come by recovering the Universal Soul in the individual (in physical consciousness) through a higher knowledge which would reconcile the concept of good, evil, joy, suffering, Life and death identifying these opposites in the universal and transform these division into a divine unity.\n\nSri Aurobindo finds that we keep a false account of the world, and give importance only to our existence and all else being negligible, would be the actual root of ego. Even in philosophising we exert too much importance on our own state of consciousness or mental standards, all outside or views tends to become false or non existent. this sense has an assertion on truth perception, giving distorted view. To recognise that we are only a partial movement of this infinite movement and that it is that infinite which we have to know, to be consciously and to fulfil faithfully, would be the commencement of true living.\n\nSri Aurobindo finds that ego, a divisive perspective to be one of the cause of the duality, is only an intermediate phenomenon of consciousness necessary for certain line of development in evolutionary process. A process which would eventually lead to dissolution of the ego by self opening of the individual to the universe and to God, this sequence of event being very similar to animalistic life as a prelude to Human life.\n\nSri Aurobindo finds that confining oneself with sensory evidence would lead to knowledge about material world and its phenomenon and nothing more, but as a result of development of Reason which accepts sensory evidence as a starting point but not limited by it goes beyond judges, works on its own right way and may arrive at a result which may be opposite to sensory observations, Sri Aurobindo states to correct the errors of sense-mind by the use of reason is one of main reason why Humanity is the cause of superiority among other life forms.\n\nFor Sri Aurobindo intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity; he describes the psychological plane in humans (often referred to as mana in Sanskrit) having two arbitrary natures, the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information (mind seeking to become aware of external world). The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry aware of other emotions. He terms this second nature as knowledge by identity.\nHe finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relations with the outer material world. As a result, when we seek to know about the external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truths about things via what our senses convey to us. However, knowledge by identity, which we currently only give the awareness of human beings' existence, can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.\n\nHe finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans (Vedic) and sages of the veda and vedanta. For the knowledge they relied entirely upon intuition and spiritual experience and not on logical reasoning but by a comparison of intuitions & experiences, as he gives an example that in the vedanta one discusses in terms of what one knows and not what one thinks of. With time once the rationalistic age took over and speculation began the Indian philosophers recognised that the vedantic texts were superior to reasons, but at the same time started from reason and tested the result it gave them, holding only those conclusions to be valid which were supported by the text. This trend of reason eventually led to conflicting schools of thought each of which the theory founded itself on Vedic texts and used its text as a weapon against the others. Sri Aurobindo believes this is due to the fact that the intuitive knowledge sees things in the whole and only sides of an indivisible whole, while reason on the contrary proceeds by analysis, dissemination and assembles its facts to form a whole. leading into assembly of facts so formed would contain opposites, anomalies, logical incompatibilities and tendencies to affirm some and negate others which conflict with its chosen conclusions so that it may form a flawlessly logical system, which has resulted in different school of thoughts in Hinduism.\n\nSri Aurobindo observes that Brahman to be present in all, not in equal part of itself but its whole self at one and to be indivisible, To Brahman there are no whole and parts, but each thing is all itself and benefits by the whole of Brahman. even though there is a presence of an illusion of quality and illusion of quantity which may differ, the self to be equal. The form, manner and result of the force of action may vary infinitely but the primal energy would remain same in all. \n\nAccording to Sri Aurobindo the Vedanta asserts that we are a subordinate and an aspect of a movement of an infinite energy and the movement being a subordinate and an aspect of something other than itself, of a great timeless, spaceless stability, unchanging over time, not acting, not energy but a pure existence. he finds that even though for an observer the world may seem a block of movement, but this energy is an output of a pure existence, this nature of existence would presuppose all end and beginning leading to the understanding that the concept of an absolute beginning and an absolute end an illusion or a fiction. \nHere He rejects the concept of Nihilism. and asserts concept of a pure existence & movement, the energy which he terms to be world-existence both to be real, one being a fact of being and other a fact of becoming. \n\neven though pure existence being an absolute is unknowable by our thought, Sri Aurobindo finds that not only can we have a glimpse of the pure existence in experience, but we can draw back into it and live in it entirely.\n\nSri Aurobindo finds that the early thoughts of Humans had compared infinite existence of force to a Sea, initially at rest, therefore being free from forms and the first disturbance necessitated the creation of forms. he finds that merry vibrations in itself was not sufficient to create forms but an obstruction in the flow of the force ocean, some contraction and expansion, interplay of vibrations, impinging of force upon force to create a fixed relations and mutual effects. according to the old Indian school of thought, following five elements were the principal building block of all things in the universe.\n\n\n\n\n\nby dividing and suggesting that all is essentially a response to vibratory contacts between force and force, thus had solved the problem of how things which seems to real to the senses is only a temporary phenomena. \n\nhowever Sri Aurobindo finds, this theory is not explaining how the contact of vibrations of force should give rise to conscious sensations.\n\nThrough evolution Spirit rediscovered itself as Spirit. Evolution follows a developmental trajectory from the original inconscience of matter into life, to mind, and then to spiritualized mind, culminating in The Supermind or Truth Consciousness. Evolution is teleological, since the developing entity contains within itself already the totality toward which it develops. It is not a mechanistic or deterministic teleology, but a \"manifestation of all the possibilities inherent in the total movement.\"\nSri Aurobindo discerns three types of being, namely the Outer being, the Inner being, and the Psychic Being.\n\nThe Outer Being includes the physical, vital and mental levels of Being, which characterises our everyday consciousness and experience. It includes several levels of the subconscient: a mental subconscient, a vital subconscient, and a physical subconscient, down to the material Inconscient. Integral Yoga involves going beyond this surface consciousness to the larger life of the Inner Being, which is more open to spiritual realisation.\n\nThe Inner Being, or Subliminal, includes the inner realms or aspects of the physical, vital and mental being. They have a larger, subtler, freer consciousness than that of the everyday consciousness. Its realisation is essential for any higher spiritual realisation.\n\nThe Inner Being is also transitional between the surface or Outer Being and the Psychic or Inmost Being. By doing yoga practice (sadhana), the inner consciousness is being opened, and life turns away from the outward to the inward. The inner consciousness becomes more real than the outer consciousness, and becomes a peace, happiness and closeness to the Divine.\n\nThe Psychic Being is Sri Aurobindo's term for the Personal Evolving Soul, the principle of Divine spirit in every individual. The Psychic is the \"Innermost Being\", the permanent being in us that stands behind and supports the physical, vital and mental principles. It \"uses mind, life and body as its instruments,\" undergoing their fate yet also transcending them.\n\nIn Integral Yoga the goal is to move inward and discover the Psychic Being, which then can bring about a transformation of the outer nature. This transformation of the outer being or ego by the Psychic is called Psychicisation; it is one of the three necessary stages in the realisation of the Supramental consciousness. This Psychic transformation is the decisive movement that enables a never-ending progress in life, through the power of connecting to one's inner spirit or Divine Essence. The Psychic begins its evolution completely veiled and hidden, but grows through successive lifetimes, and gradually exerts a greater influence, taking on the role of spiritual Guide.\n\nCentral Being refers to the transcendent and eternal spirit, as opposed to the incarnate and evolving Soul, which he calls the Psychic Being. Sometimes it refers to both of them together as the essential spiritual core of the being. The Central Being \"presides over the different births one after the other but is itself unborn\" (ibid p. 269). This transcendent Central Being or Spirit is also designated as the Jiva or Jivatman, although the meaning of these terms in Sri Aurobindo's philosophy differs greatly from that of much of conventional Vedanta (especially Advaita Vedanta)\n\nThe levels of being ascend from the inconscient to the Supermind.\n\nInconscient Matter is the lowest level of involution. Spirit is still present in the inconscient: \"The Inconscient is the Superconscient's sleep.\" The Inconscient is also the instrument of the Superconsciousness which has created the Universe. According to Satprem, the Inconscient lies at the bottom of the physical subconscient, and \"life emerged [...] at the border between the material inconscient and the physical consciousness [...] in our body.\n\nThe physical, vital and mental levels of being contain both a subconscient and a subtle or subliminal part.\n\nThe subconscient parts are the submerged parts. It contains \"obstinate samskaras, impressions, associations, fixed notions, habitual reactions formed by the past.\" According to Satprem, there are several levels of the subconscient, corresponding with the different levels of our being: a mental subconscient, a vital subconscient, and a physical subconscient, down to the material Inconscient.\n\nAccording to Sri Aurobindo, the body is partly a creation of the inconscient or subconscient. According to The Mother, the ordinary, false consciousness, which is common to material body-consciousness, is derived from the subconscient and the inconscient. According to Aurobindo, the outer being depends on the subconscient, which hinders the spiritual progress. Only by living in the inner being can this obstacle be overcome.\n\nAccording to Sharma, the subconscient is \"the inconscient in the proces of becoming conscient.\" It is a submerged part of the personality without waking consciousness, but which does receive impressions, and influences the conscious mind. According to Sharma, it includes the unconscious mind which is described by psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, though it includes much more than the unconscious of (Freudian) psychology.\n\nThe subtle or subliminal is the subtle, higher counterpart of the subconscient. According to Sharma, \"it has an inner mind, an inner vital being, and an inner subtle physical being, wider than man's consciousness.\" It can directly experience the Universal, and \"it is the source of inspirations, intuitions, ideas, will [...] as well as [...] telepathy [and] clearvoyance.\"\n\nThe gross body commonly referred to in yoga constitutes mainly of two parts the material physical body (annakosha) and the nervous system normally refer to as vital vehicle (Prana kosha) in Integral yoga.\n\nThe Physical level refers to both the physical body and the body's consciousness. The body is just as conscious as the vital and mental parts of the being, only it is a different type of consciousness. The Physical not only shades upwards to higher ontological levels, but also downwards into the Subconscient.\n\nThe Subtle physical is Sri Aurobindo's term for a subtler aspect of the physical nature. This has many qualities not found in the gross physical nature. In \"The Agenda\", The Mother often refers to it. It might be compared to the etheric body and plane, or even the astral body and plane. The term \"subtle physical\" is used to distinguish it from gross (\"sthula\") or outer material physical.\n\nThe Vital level of the being refers to the life force, but also to the various passions, desires, feelings, emotions, affects, compulsions, and likes and dislikes. These strongly determine human motivation and action through desire and enthusiasm.\n\nUnlike Western psychology, in which mind, emotions, instincts, and consciousness are all lumped together, Sri Aurobindo strongly distinguishes between the \"Vital\" and the \"Mental\" faculties.\n\nIn addition to the individual Vital faculty, Sri Aurobindo refers to a Vital Plane or Vital world, which would seem to be partly equivalent to the Astral Plane of popular occultism and New Age thought.\n\nMind proper is the conceptual and cognitive mind. Mind is a subordinate process of the Supermind. It is the intermediary stage between the Divine and the mundane life. It works by measuring and dividing reality, and has lost sight of the Divine. It is the seat of ignorance, yet it is still capable of an upward ascent toward the Divine.\n\nUnlike Western psychology, in which mind and consciousness are considered the same, Sri Aurobindo strongly distinguishes between the \"Mental\" and the \"Vital\" (emotional) faculties, as well as between Mind and pure Consciousness. Sri Aurobindo in part bases his concept of the Mental on his reading of the Taittiriya Upanishad, the mental being (or perhaps just the Mental Purusha) is the \"mano-maya-atma\"—the self made of mind (\"manas\").\n\nFor Sri Aurobindo, Mind or the Mental being is not simple and uniform, but consists itself of various strata and subdivisions, which act at different levels of being. These various faculties are described or variously referred to, usually in obliquely or in passing, in some of his books, including \"Savitri\", which has poetic references to many types of Mind. In his letters answering questions from disciples, Sri Aurobindo summarises the characteristics of the various levels of Mind.\n\nAbove mind proper lie various higher individual levels of mind, namely the Higher Mind, Illumined Mind, Intuitive Mind and Overmind, which ascend toward the Spirit, and provide a higher and more inclusive vision of reality:\n\nSupermind is the infinite unitary Truth Consciousness or Truth-Idea beyond the three lower planes of Matter, Life, and Mind. Supermind is the dynamic form of Sachchidananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss), and the necessary mediator or link between the transcendent Sacchidananda and the creation.\n\nHumans are stuck between matter and Spirit, due to the habits of personality and partial awareness, which arise from Ignorance.\n\nHumans are accustomed to respond to certain vibrations more than other. These customs develop into one's desire, pain, feelings, which are all a set of habits. This crystallised set of habits becomes one's personality. This is normally believed to be \"self\". The appearance of stable personality is given by constant repetition and recurrence of the same vibrations and formations.\n\nAccording to Sri Aurobindo, humans face three basic problems:\n\nThe fundamental cause of falsehood, error and evil is Ignorance. Ignorance is a self-limiting knowledge, which arises with exclusive concentration in a single field. According to Sri Aurobindo, human notion of good, bad and evil are uncertain and relative.\n\nUnlike other Yoga practices \"Integral yoga\" does not propose any kind of physical asanas, breathing techniques or external movements. It is more psychological in nature, with internal reflection and self-analysis and correction as main tools of development .\n\nThe main practices or approaches are divided into \n\nThe limitations of the present being can be overcome by the Triple transformation, the process in which the lower nature is transformed into the divine nature. It consists of the inward psychicisation by which the sadhak gets in contact with the inner divine principle or Psychic Being; the spiritual transformation or spiritualisation; and the Supramentalisation of the entire being.\n\nPsychicisation is a turn inward, so that one realises the psychic being, the psychic personality or Divine Soul, in the core of one's being. The Divine Soul serves as a spiritual Guide in the yoga, and enables one to transform the outer being. It may also help avoid the dangers of the spiritual path. There is an intermediate zone, a dangerous and misleading transitional spiritual and pseudospiritual region between the ordinary consciousness and true spiritual realisation.\n\nPsychisiation consists of three methods. In \"consecration\" one opens oneself to the Force before engaging in an activity. \"Moving to the Depths\" (or \"concentration\") is a movement away from the surface existence to a deeper existence within. \"Surrender\" means offering all one's work, one's life to the Divine Force and Intent. Guided by the evolving divine soul within, the sadhak moves away from ego, ignorance, finiteness, and the limitations of the outer being. It is thanks to this guidance by the Divine Soul that the sadhak can avoid the pitfalls of the spiritual path.\n\nAs a result of the Psychicisation, light, peace, and power descend into the body, transforming all of its parts, physical, vital, and mental. This is the Spiritual transformation, or Spiritualisation, the concretisation of the larger spiritual consciousness. It is equivalent to \"enlightenment\", as found in Vedanta and Buddhism.\n\nSri Aurobindo asserted that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, and freedom from normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Sri Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.\n\nSupramentalisation is the realisation of the Supermind, or Supramental consciousness, and the resulting transformation of the entire being. Psychicisation and spiritualisation serve as necessary prerequisites for the Supramentalisation of the entire being.\n\nThe supramental transformation is the final stage in the integral yoga, enabling the birth of a new individual, fully formed by the supramental power. Such individuals would be the forerunners of a new supra-humanity, grounded in truth-consciousness. All aspects of division and ignorance of consciousness, at the vital and mental levels, would be overcome, and replaced with a unity of consciousness at every plane. And even the physical body transformed and divinised. A new supramental species would then emerge, living a supramental, gnostic, divine life on earth.\n\nSri Aurobindo describes several results and different stages depicting the stages of development in integral yoga, called together the \"sapta chatushtaya\", \"seven quadrates.\" It consists of:.\n\nSri Aurobindo had a strong influence on Ken Wilber's integral theory of spiritual development. Wilber's Causal and Ultimate stages closely resemble Aurobindo's higher mental stages, but Wilber lumps together levels of Being, types of Being and developmental stages.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most examples are similar to a child's size violin in size, and are tuned a minor third (B–F–C–G) or a fourth higher (C–G–D–A). Probably the most famous work featuring violino piccolo is the first Brandenburg Concerto of Johann Sebastian Bach. \n\nThe best-known violino piccolo is the Brothers Amati example in the National Music Museum, in Vermillion, South Dakota. By modern measurements, the body is size, the neck size, and the head corresponds to that of a size instrument. The string length is the equivalent of a violin stopped a minor third from the nut, which corresponds with its normal tuning of a third higher than a violin. It's notated in E flat. This Amati violin also has fingerboard widths similar to that of a board cut a third shorter, which in view of the other measurements implies a clear conceptual relationship to the -sized violin.\n\nWhen the construction of the violin changed as the rococo period began, it became possible to play many higher-pitched violin parts on a standard violin, and the piccolo was no longer considered necessary. In modern performances of older works that specifically call for the violino piccolo, it is common for a woodwind instrument capable of playing in its range, such as an oboe, to be substituted.\n\nViolins of similar tuning have been built in modern times (specifically the soprano violin of the new violin family) but have not yet been accepted as standard.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1817879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817879", "title": "Los Angeles Metro Rail", "text": "Los Angeles Metro Rail\n\nThe Los Angeles Metro Rail is an urban rail transportation system serving Los Angeles County, California. It consists of six lines, including two rapid transit subway lines (the B and D lines) and four light rail lines (the A, C, L and E lines) serving 93 stations. It connects with the Metro Busway bus rapid transit system (the G Line (Orange) and J Line (Silver)) and also with the Metrolink commuter rail system.\n\nMetro Rail is owned and operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and started service in 1990. It has been extended significantly since that time and several further extensions are either in the works or being considered. The system served a ridership of 344,176 on an average weekday in 2018.\n\nLos Angeles had two previous rail transit systems, the Pacific Electric Red Car and Los Angeles Railway Yellow Car lines, which operated between the late 19th century and the 1960s. The Metro Rail system utilizes many of their former rights-of-way, and thus can be considered their indirect successor.\n\nIn Los Angeles Metro terminology, common with most other metro systems, a \"line\" is a named service, defined by a route and set of stations served by trains on that route. (The word does not refer to a physical rail corridor, as it does in New York City Subway nomenclature.) Metro Rail lines are for the most part named after colors, and these colors are used to distinguish the lines on Metro's maps. (The one exception is the Expo Line, which nevertheless is consistently colored aqua on maps.) Metro also uses colors for its Metro Busway services (which are bus services operating in transitways).\n\nAs of late 2019, Metro is in the process of renaming all of its rail and BRT lines with letters, while leaving their colors unchanged on maps.\n\nSix Metro Rail lines operate in Los Angeles County:\n\nThe B and D lines follow a fully underground route (subway), and the C Line follows a fully grade separated route. The A, E and L Line routes run in a mix of environments, including at-grade street running, at-grade in an exclusive corridor, elevated, and underground.\n\nThe two heavy-rail lines (B and D) share tracks between and , while two of the light-rail lines (A and E) share tracks between and . Future system expansions are expected to use more shared light-rail tracks.\n\nThe large majority of light rail stations are either at ground level or elevated, while a handful are underground. All heavy rail stations are underground. Future light rail lines will add more underground stations to the system.\n\nStations include at least two ticket vending machines, wayfinding maps, electronic message displays, and bench seating. Each station features unique artwork reflecting local culture and/or the function of transit in society.\n\nStations are unstaffed during regular hours. Call boxes are available at most stations to allow employees at the Metro Rail Operations Control Center to assist passengers with concerns.\n\nMetro Rail uses a proof-of-payment fare system, with Metro's fare inspectors randomly inspecting trains and stations to ensure passengers have a valid fare product on their Transit Access Pass (TAP) electronic fare card. When passengers enter a station, they encounter TAP card validators which collect fares when a customer places their card on top. Additionally, fare gates (turnstiles) connected to TAP card validators are at all underground stations, all elevated stations and some surface stations. Once passengers pass these validators or board a train, they have entered the \"fare paid zone,\" where fare inspectors may check their TAP card to ensure they have a valid fare.\n\nUnderground stations are typically large in size with a mezzanine level for fare sales and collection above a platform level where passengers board trains.\n\nStreet-level stations are typically more simple with platforms designed with shade canopies, separated from nearby roads and sidewalks, where passengers can purchase fares and board a train.\n\nSubway stations and tunnels are designed to resist ground shaking that could occur at a specific location, but there is no general magnitude of earthquake that the entire system is expected to withstand. The Metro Rail system has not suffered any damage due to earthquakes since its opening in 1993.\n\nSome suburban stations have free or paid park and ride lots available and most have bike storage available.\n\nMetro Rail maintains two distinct systems of rail: a light rail system and a heavy rail system. The heavy rail and light rail systems are incompatible with each other, even though they both use . Metro's heavy rail lines are powered by third rail, whereas its light rail lines are powered by overhead catenary. Also, the two separate systems have different loading gauge, and platforms are designed to match the separate car widths.\n\nAll Metro Rail lines run regularly between 5am and midnight, seven days a week. Limited service on particular segments is provided after midnight and before 5am. On Friday and Saturday evenings, service operates until approximately 2am. There is no rail service between 2am and 3:30am, except on special occasions such as New Year's Eve. Service operates every 5–10 minutes during the peak period, every 10–15 minutes during middays and during the day on weekends, and every 20 minutes during the evening until the close of service. Exact times vary from route to route.\n\nThe standard Metro base fare applies for all trips. Fare collection is based on a partial proof-of-payment system. At least two fare machines are at each station. Fare inspectors, local police and deputy sheriffs police the system and cite individuals without fares. Passengers are required to purchase a TAP card to enter stations equipped with fare gates. Passengers using a TAP card can transfer between Metro routes for free within 2 hours from the first tap.\n\nThe following table shows Metro fares, effective May 15, 2018 (in US dollars):\nMetro has implemented a system of electronic fare collection using a stored value smartcard called the Transit Access Pass (or TAP Card). This card was intended to simplify fare collection and reduce costs. In 2012, paper monthly passes were phased out and replaced with the TAP Card. As of September 2013, first-time Metro riders must deposit an additional $2 (or $1 at TAP vending machines) on top of their first fare payment to obtain a reloadable TAP Card.\n\nIn addition, Metro began installing fare gates in 2008, at all heavy rail stations and select light rail stations. Implementation of both programs (the TAP Card and the fare gate program) has turned out to be expensive ($154 million in total, so far) and its initial rollout was problematic.\n\nThe Metro Rail system saw a total ridership of 108,017,525 in 2018.\n\nAs of the second quarter of 2018, the combined Metro Red and Purple lines averaged a weekday ridership of 135,400, making it the ninth busiest heavy rail (rapid transit) system in the United States. Taking overall track length into consideration, Metro Rail's heavy rail lines transport 7,960 passengers per route mile, making this the fifth busiest system U.S. rapid transit system on a per mile basis.\n\nMetro's light rail system is the busiest in the United States with 203,300 average weekday boardings during the second quarter of 2018. At Metro's light rail system is the second largest in the United States.\n\nHalf of the Metro Rail's trains and stations are patrolled by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, under a law enforcement contract. The Los Angeles Police Department, and Long Beach Police Department, also patrol stations within their respective cities, also under contract. The system is also monitored by security personnel by closed-circuit television cameras in Metro Rail stations and subway cars.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Southern California had an extensive privately owned rail transit network with over of track, operated by Pacific Electric (Red Cars) and Los Angeles Railway (Yellow Cars). However, from 1927 revenue shortfall caused Pacific Electric to begin replacing lightly used rail lines with buses. In 1958 the remnants of the privately owned rail and bus systems were consolidated into a government agency known as the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority or MTA. By 1963 the remaining rail lines were completely removed and replaced with bus service.\n\nIn the following decades, growing traffic congestion led to increased public support for rail transit's return. Beginning in the 1970s, a variety of factors, including environmental concerns, an increasing population and the price of gasoline led to calls for mass transit other than buses. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA, now branded as Metro) began construction of the initial lines throughout the 1980s using revenues from a voter-approved increase in sales tax. The Blue (A) Line finally opened on July 14, 1990, some 27 years after the final streetcar line closed. Since that date, the system has been developed to its current size. The following table shows this expansion's timeline:\n\nMetro has worked to plan and prioritize project funding and implementation. Metro's 2009 Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) was developed to provide a long-term vision of transportation system development for the next 30 years. Metro is currently attempting to update the LRTP 2009 plan citing new housing trends and fiscal changes. Metro plans to release the updated LRTP in early 2020.\n\nBeginning in 2014, Metro saw its ridership numbers begin to decline. Many explanations exist for the decline, including safety concerns, an increase in ride-hailing service usage, and low-income housing opportunities drying up in L.A. because of the increase in rents, a shortage of housing.\n\nThe fiscal changes are the passage of Measure R, a countywide incrememental sales tax increase passed by voters in 2008, provides funding for many of the highest priority projects in the LRTP. On November 6, 2012, Metro attempted to pass Measure J, but failed as it did not reach the two-thirds majority needed to pass.\n\nIn November 2016 election, Metro decided to place another sales tax on the ballot. The voters then approved Measure M, a half-cent permanent sales tax increase, to fund many local projects, including Metro Rail expansion.\n\nIn 2018, Metro approved renaming its rail lines using a letter-based scheme, similar to those in New York City. Metro recommended the opening of the refurbished Blue Line (A Line) in 2019 as a starting point to rename the lines, and then continuing with the opening of the Crenshaw/LAX line, finishing in time for the opening of the Regional Connector in 2022.\n\nThe following rail projects have been given high priority by Metro. They all appear in the 2009 LRTP constrained plan, and all have funding earmarked from Measure R. With the passage of Measure M in 2016, Metro released an updated Long Range Transportation plan in February 2017, and will release a full report early 2020, along with its Twenty-eight by '28 initiative.\n\nThe following proposed line/system expansions do not have funding or high priority in Metro's long-range plans. Some are listed as \"strategic unfunded\" in the last Long Range Transportation Plan, indicating some possibility they could be constructed should additional funding materialize. Others have been the subject of Metro Board discussion, with the possibility of future feasibility studies. (More information on each project can be found in the references.)\n\nNote a major update of Metro's 2009 plan is underway, updating the Long Range Transportation Plan. The results of early planning studies as a part of that process are expected to be made public in approximately early 2020, and may result in the addition of new proposed projects, changes to concepts listed below, and the removal of concepts whose popularity has declined since 2009.\n\n"}

Some authors use the terms \"convex polytope\" and \"convex polyhedron\" interchangeably, while others prefer to draw a distinction between the notions of a polyhedron and a polytope.\n\nIn addition, some texts require a polytope to be a bounded set, while others (including this article) allow polytopes to be unbounded. The terms \"bounded/unbounded convex polytope\" will be used below whenever the boundedness is critical to the discussed issue. Yet other texts treat a convex \"n\"-polytope as a surface or (\"n\"-1)-manifold.\n\nConvex polytopes play an important role both in various branches of mathematics and in applied areas, most notably in linear programming.\n\nA comprehensive and influential book in the subject, called \"Convex Polytopes\", was published in 1967 by Branko Grünbaum. In 2003 the 2nd edition of the book was published, with significant additional material contributed by new writers.\n\nIn Grünbaum's book, and in some other texts in discrete geometry, convex polytopes are often simply called \"polytopes\". Grünbaum points out that this is solely to avoid the endless repetition of the word \"convex\", and that the discussion should throughout be understood as applying only to the convex variety.\n\nA polytope is called \"full-dimensional\" if it is an \"n\"-dimensional object in R.\n\n\nA convex polytope may be defined in a number of ways, depending on what is more suitable for the problem at hand. Grünbaum's definition is in terms of a convex set of points in space. Other important definitions are: as the intersection of half-spaces (half-space representation) and as the convex hull of a set of points (vertex representation).\n\nIn his book \"Convex polytopes\", Grünbaum defines a convex polytope as a compact convex set with a finite number of extreme points:\n\nThis is equivalent to defining a bounded convex polytope as the convex hull of a finite set of points, where the finite set must contain the set of extreme points of the polytope. Such a definition is called a vertex representation (V-representation or V-description). For a compact convex polytope, the minimal V-description is unique and it is given by the set of the vertices of the polytope.\nA convex polytope is called an integral polytope if all of its vertices have integer coordinates.\n\nA convex polytope may be defined as an intersection of a finite number of half-spaces. Such definition is called a half-space representation (H-representation or H-description). There exist infinitely many H-descriptions of a convex polytope. However, for a full-dimensional convex polytope, the minimal H-description is in fact unique and is given by the set of the facet-defining halfspaces.\n\nA closed half-space can be written as a linear inequality:\n\nwhere \"n\" is the dimension of the space containing the polytope under consideration. Hence, a closed convex polytope may be regarded as the set of solutions to the system of linear inequalities:\n\nwhere \"m\" is the number of half-spaces defining the polytope. This can be concisely written as the matrix inequality:\n\nwhere \"A\" is an \"m\"×\"n\" matrix, \"x\" is an \"n\"×1 column vector of variables, and \"b\" is an \"m\"×1 column vector of constants.\n\nAn open convex polytope is defined in the same way, with strict inequalities used in the formulas instead of the non-strict ones.\n\nThe coefficients of each row of \"A\" and \"b\" correspond with the coefficients of the linear inequality defining the respective half-space. Hence, each row in the matrix corresponds with a supporting hyperplane of the polytope, a hyperplane bounding a half-space that contains the polytope. If a supporting hyperplane also intersects the polytope, it is called a bounding hyperplane (since it is a supporting hyperplane, it can only intersect the polytope at the polytope's boundary).\n\nThe foregoing definition assumes that the polytope is full-dimensional. If it is not, then the solution of \"Ax\" ≤ \"b\" lies in a proper affine subspace of R and discussion of the polytope may be constrained to this subspace.\n\nIn general the intersection of arbitrary half-spaces need not be bounded. However if one wishes to have a definition equivalent to that as a convex hull, then bounding must be explicitly required.\n\nThe finite basis theorem is an extension of the notion of V-description to include infinite polytopes. The theorem states that a convex polyhedron is the convex sum of its vertices plus the conical sum of the Euclidean vectors of its infinite edges.\n\nEvery (bounded) convex polytope is the image of a simplex, as every point is a convex combination of the (finitely many) vertices. However, polytopes are not in general isomorphic to simplices. This is in contrast to the case of vector spaces and linear combinations, every finite-dimensional vector space being not only an image of, but in fact isomorphic to, Euclidean space of some dimension (or analog over other fields).\n\nA face of a convex polytope is any intersection of the polytope with a halfspace such that none of the interior points of the polytope lie on the boundary of the halfspace. If a polytope is \"d\"-dimensional, its facets are its (\"d\" − 1)-dimensional faces, its vertices are its 0-dimensional faces, its edges are its 1-dimensional faces, and its ridges are its (\"d\" − 2)-dimensional faces.\n\nGiven a convex polytope \"P\" defined by the matrix inequality formula_3, if each row in \"A\" corresponds with a bounding hyperplane and is linearly independent of the other rows, then each facet of \"P\" corresponds with exactly one row of \"A\", and vice versa. Each point on a given facet will satisfy the linear equality of the corresponding row in the matrix. (It may or may not also satisfy equality in other rows). Similarly, each point on a ridge will satisfy equality in two of the rows of \"A\".\nIn general, an (\"n\" − \"j\")-dimensional face satisfies equality in \"j\" specific rows of \"A\". These rows form a basis of the face. Geometrically speaking, this means that the face is the set of points on the polytope that lie in the intersection of \"j\" of the polytope's bounding hyperplanes.\n\nThe faces of a convex polytope thus form an Eulerian lattice called its face lattice, where the partial ordering is by set containment of faces. The definition of a face given above allows both the polytope itself and the empty set to be considered as faces, ensuring that every pair of faces has a join and a meet in the face lattice. The whole polytope is the unique maximum element of the lattice, and the empty set, considered to be a (−1)-dimensional face (a null polytope) of every polytope, is the unique minimum element of the lattice.\n\nTwo polytopes are called combinatorially isomorphic if their face lattices are isomorphic.\n\nThe polytope graph (polytopal graph, graph of the polytope, 1-skeleton) is the set of vertices and edges of the polytope only, ignoring higher-dimensional faces. For instance, a polyhedral graph is the polytope graph of a three-dimensional polytope. By a result of Whitney the face lattice of a three-dimensional polytope is determined by its graph. The same is true for simple polytopes of arbitrary dimension (Blind & Mani-Levitska 1987, proving a conjecture of Micha Perles). Kalai (1988) gives a simple proof based on unique sink orientations. Because these polytopes' face lattices are determined by their graphs, the problem of deciding whether two three-dimensional or simple convex polytopes are combinatorially isomorphic can be formulated equivalently as a special case of the graph isomorphism problem. However, it is also possible to translate these problems in the opposite direction, showing that polytope isomorphism testing is graph-isomorphism complete.\n\nA convex polytope, like any compact convex subset of R, is homeomorphic to a closed ball. Let \"m\" denote the dimension of the polytope. If the polytope is full-dimensional, then \"m\" = \"n\". The convex polytope therefore is an \"m\"-dimensional manifold with boundary, its Euler characteristic is 1, and its fundamental group is trivial. The boundary of the convex polytope is homeomorphic to an (\"m\" − 1)-sphere. The boundary's Euler characteristic is 0 for even \"m\" and 2 for odd \"m\". The boundary may also be regarded as a tessellation of (\"m\" − 1)-dimensional spherical space — i.e. as a spherical tiling.\n\nA convex polytope can be decomposed into a simplicial complex, or union of simplices, satisfying certain properties.\n\nGiven a convex \"r\"-dimensional polytope \"P\", a subset of its vertices containing (\"r\"+1) affinely independent points defines an \"r\"-simplex. It is possible to form a collection of subsets such that the union of the corresponding simplices is equal to \"P\", and the intersection of any two simplices is either empty or a lower-dimensional simplex. This simplicial decomposition is the basis of many methods for computing the volume of a convex polytope, since the volume of a simplex is easily given by a formula.\n\nDifferent representations of a convex polytope have different utility, therefore the construction of one representation given another one is an important problem. The problem of the construction of a V-representation is known as the vertex enumeration problem and the problem of the construction of a H-representation is known as the facet enumeration problem. While the vertex set of a bounded convex polytope uniquely defines it, in various applications it is important to know more about the combinatorial structure of the polytope, i.e., about its face lattice. Various convex hull algorithms deal both with the facet enumeration and face lattice construction.\n\nIn the planar case, i.e., for a convex polygon, both facet and vertex enumeration problems amount to the ordering vertices (resp. edges) around the convex hull. It is a trivial task when the convex polygon is specified in a traditional for polygons way, i.e., by the ordered sequence of its vertices formula_5. When the input list of vertices (or edges) is unordered, the time complexity of the problems becomes O(\"m\" log \"m\"). A matching lower bound is known in the algebraic decision tree model of computation.\n\n\n"}

They are known for their hit single \"Fever for the Flava\". Knipp left in December 2003, but remained friends with the band, subbing in on drums when needed, and rejoined in 2011. Espaillat left in 2006 to pursue other musical ventures. He continues to be an in-demand session bassist in Nashville, and is currently the touring bassist for country singer Trace Adkins.

When they saw him they'd say, \"here comes the hot action cop.\" Werthner cites musical influences including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, The Eagles, New York hardcore, Southern hip-hop, punk, metal, reggae, and songwriters like Billy Joel and Elvis Costello.\n\nTheir first release, \"Nutbag EP\", was recorded in 2001 and released in 2002, and was only available to purchase at live shows or direct order from the band. The band released their debut album, the self-titled \"Hot Action Cop\" (produced by Michael Baker), on Lava Records/Atlantic Records in 2003. They achieved moderate success with the single \"Fever for the Flava\" despite limited radio support. The band toured extensively from October 2002 to December 2003 throughout the US, Canada, Germany, and England supporting bands such as Evanescence and Trapt, and including a spot on the northwestern leg of the 2003 Lollapalooza tour.\n\nHot Action Cop released a six-song EP in 2009 with Werthner, Flaherty, Espaillat, Feese, and Nashville session drummer Miles McPherson.\n\nOn May 1, 2012, the band released a cover of the Pink Floyd song \"Comfortably Numb\" on iTunes and Amazon. Recorded during a break from touring in 2003, the song features the original line-up of Werthner, Flaherty, Espaillat, Knipp, and Feese.\n\nThe band's fourth release \"Listen Up!\" was released February 7, 2014, available on hotactioncop.com, Spotify, and iTunes. A video was produced for the song \"House of Pain\". It was subsequently used in promos for \"House of DVF\" on the E! Network. The album was dedicated to Daniel Feese, who died in January 2014.\n\nEvery year since 2015, Hot Action Cop has headlined or co-headlined a private festival called Lampapalooza in Wauwatosa, WI, and has shared the stage with Sponge, Public Enemy, Run DMC, EPMD, Rakim, Sir Mix-a-lot, Bobby Bare, Jr., and Elephant Room.\n\nTimmy Flaherty has released two solo albums available on Spotify and iTunes, and is currently working on a third. He also plays in a Ramones tribute band with Daniel Feese's brother Dylan Feese on lead vocals.\n\nJuan Chavolla joined the Louisville, KY band Elephant Room, playing live and recording with Malcolm Springer in Nashville, TN. Elephant Room and Hot Action Cop have played several shows together with Chavolla pulling double duty on bass guitar.\n\nRob Werthner and original producer Michael Baker are currently putting the finishing touches on a new Hot Action Cop release slated for late 2018/early 2019. They are currently running behind schedule as it’s now 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fever for the Flava\" was featured in many movies, and also appeared in episodes of the shows \"King of the Hill\", \"Malcolm in the Middle\", \"Smallville\", \"Boston Legal\", and \"The Man Show\". Werthner also wrote the theme song for the Samuel L. Jackson/Colin Farrell film \"S.W.A.T.\". Alternate clean versions of \"Fever for the Flava\" and the album version of \"Goin' Down on It\" as well with instrumental versions of both of those songs appeared on the EA video game \"\". It was also voted No. 49 on MuchMusic's (later called Fuse) list of the 50 Most Controversial Videos.\n\n\n"}

It is situated on the Cross-City Line which runs from Redditch to Lichfield via Birmingham New Street. Most services are operated by West Midlands Trains who manage the station, with some services also operated by CrossCountry.\n\nLocated on the former Birmingham West Suburban Railway, University station was built in 1977/8 to the designs of the architect John Broome as part of the upgrade of the Cross City line. The station was opened by William Rodgers, then Secretary of State for Transport, on 8 May 1978. Although this was the first station on the site, it is located a short distance away from the former Somerset Road station which was closed in the 1930s. The Cross-City Line was electrified in 1993 and the current Class 323 electric multiple units were introduced by British Rail on local services.\n\nIn 2017 it was announced that University railway station would receive up to £10 million as an improvement fund to enhance passenger experience and reduce overcrowding as part of the Government's Midlands Engine Strategy.\n\nPedestrian access is via University Road West, close to the Medical School and bus interchange - around uphill from University Square. Due to the station's campus location on a service road there is no car parking, although nearby Selly Oak station is a designated Park and Ride station. The station is also situated alongside the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, a popular cycling and jogging route. Access is at street level as there is a fence between Platform 2 and the towpath.\n\nThe station is the only main line railway station in Great Britain built specifically to serve a university. There is a covered waiting room on Platform 2. There are also two automated ticket machines on the concourse and two windowed ticket booths, staffed all day Monday to Saturday and from 9:20 on Sundays. There is lift access down to both platforms from the entrance. Fare control is enforced by a line of automatic ticket barriers installed in April 2009, as at Five Ways.\n\nThe station is served by West Midlands Trains with local Cross-City Line services operated by 3- or 6-car Class 323 electrical multiple units. West Midlands Trains longer-distance services to Hereford and CrossCountry services to Cardiff and Nottingham are operated by air-conditioned Turbostar diesel multiple units.\n\nUniversity station is the seventh busiest station in the Network West Midlands region in terms of passenger numbers, and the busiest without a direct link to London. Just under four million passenger journeys were made to and from the station in the year 2018-19.\n\nThe typical off-peak weekday service is as follows, in trains per hour (tph):\n\nAll services from Platform 1 stop at Birmingham New Street with an average journey time of 8 minutes.\n\n\n\nThere is level access from the street to the ticket office and footbridge. Lifts provide access to both platforms from the footbridge. The station has a wide ticket gate which wheelchair users can use unaided.\n\n"}

It was the third of four singles released from the album. The song was controversial for its time, with the lyrics written from the perspective of a young man determined to have sex with a Catholic girl.\n\nThe song was inspired by a high school crush of Joel's, Virginia Callahan. The boy/narrator believes that the girl is refusing him because she comes from a religious Catholic family and that she believes premarital sex is sinful. He sings,\n\n<poem>You Catholic girls start much too late,\nbut sooner or later it comes down to fate.\nI might as well be the one.</poem>\n\nAttempts to censor the song only made it more popular, after religious groups considered it anti-Catholic, and pressured radio stations to remove it from their playlists. \"When I wrote 'Only the Good Die Young', the point of the song wasn't so much anti-Catholic as pro-lust,\" Joel told \"Performing Songwriter\" magazine. \"The minute they banned it, the album started shooting up the charts.\" In a 2008 interview, Joel also pointed out one part of the lyrics that virtually all the song's critics missed – the boy in the song failed to get anywhere with the girl, and she kept her chastity.\n\nA demo, included in the box set \"My Lives\", is a slower, reggae version of the song. Joel reprised the song's motif in this version with a church organ. Joel has stated publicly that he changed the reggae beat to a shuffle beat at the request of his long time drummer, Liberty DeVitto, who hated reggae music.\n\n"}
{"id": "1817899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817899", "title": "National Hobo Convention", "text": "National Hobo Convention\n\nThe National Hobo Convention is held on the second weekend of every August since 1900 in the town of Britt, Iowa, organized by the local Chamber of Commerce, and known throughout the town as the annual \"Hobo Day\" celebration. The National Hobo Convention is the largest gathering of hobos, rail-riders, and tramps, who gather to celebrate the American traveling worker.\n\nIt's very important to define between hobos, tramps and bums as the hobos are sensitive to the titles. Hobos are workers who travel to find work. Many are skilled craftsmen (women). They are workers. Tramps travel but don't work and Bums are just those who typically don't work and don't travel.\n\nTraditionally there has been a parade on the Saturday at 10:00 a.m., where everyone can let their hobo spirit soar as they participate in the parade. A phrase that describes the parade is, \"Some in rags, some in tags, some in velvet gowns.\"\n\nAccording to the Chamber of Commerce:\n\nFrom a Convention attendee:\n\nBritt's \"Hobo Days\" celebration usually draws about 20,000 tourists over several days, and about 75 or 80 tramps. There is usually a carnival installed on the main drag, with a small Ferris wheel, Tilt-a-Whirl rides and so on. Most of the rides are more suitable for smaller children. There are various food service trucks selling barbecue, pork-chop-on-a-stick, cotton candy and so on. There are often people with sort of \"flea market\" tables, \"farmer's market\" tables selling local produce, etc. Of course, the Hobo Museum is open, and Ms. Castillo's portraits of the Hobo Kings and Queens are on display. During most conventions there is usually live music somewhere downtown in the late afternoon and at night. Saturday morning there is the \"Hobo Days\" parade. It's a lot like a small-town Fourth of July celebration. The parade includes fire trucks, local high school marching bands, ROTC units, antique cars, 4-H Club and FFA clubs on horseback, restored antique tractors and farm equipment and so forth. There is always a trailer float for the hobos to ride. Hobos who participate in the parade bring a supply of individually wrapped hard candy to throw to the children along the parade route.\n\nA signature event every year is the selection of the King and Queen of Hobos. There are rules about who can run and the candidates' qualifications. Men must actually have been a tramp, but there are no qualification rules for the women running for Queen, and no requirement for them to ever have actually been a hobo, although many of the women who have been selected as Queen were actual rail riders with bona fide hoboing experience. The \"election\" is done at the town's gazebo, and is preceded by campaign speeches. A group of vetted hobo judges decides who wins by the applause of the crowd. Inevitably, drama ensues. All this happens as the town is serving up several thousand gallons of mulligan stew.\n\nThere is a difference between the town of Britt's \"Hobo Days\" celebration and the actual convention meeting itself, although visitors are more than welcome to come visit and/or camp in the \"National Hobo Jungle\" next to the railroad tracks. The actual convention is a convention of members of Tourist Union #63, founded in 1899 and still existing today. (There were sixty-three original members.) Much of the convention's activities take place in the Jungle, or in the National Hobo Cemetery (which is in a corner of Britt's Evergreen Cemetery.) There is a day dedicated to cleaning, re-painting and mowing the hobo graves, and a Memorial Service the following day. Generally, shortly after the memorial service, a Hobo Council is convened, and this is an activity limited to actual hobos and members of TU63. You can identify many members of TU63 by a small round patch sewn to a cap or jacket that is a white-bordered black circle with the white numerals \"63\" inside.\n\nThe jungle operates more-or-less on the \"honor system.\" People with the means to do so are asked to contribute an amount similar to what they would pay for a restaurant meal into the \"Frisco Circle\" kitty. Those without funds or with limited funds are welcome to eat for free, but encouraged to help with the kitchen chores. (Half the fun of the convention is being \"part of the crew\" that does the cooking, \"pearl diving\" and cleaning up. Newbies are encouraged to report to the \"Crumb Boss\" for an assignment somewhere on the kitchen crew.) Camping in the Jungle is free. No fireworks, firewater or firearms are permitted within the jungle. (There are several bars and excellent restaurants within easy walking distance.) There are no hotel or motels in Britt.\n\nTent camping or \"tarp camping\" within the Jungle is free.\n\nOther events during Hobo weekend include a Hobo 5K & Hobo 10K Walk/Run, Hobo King & Hobo Queen coronation, Hobo Museum, Hobo Auction, Hobo Memorial Service, Hobo Sunday Outdoor Church Service, Hobo Classic Car Show, Hobo Arts and Crafts Show and various hobo musical entertainment. The Hobo Jungle is open to the public.\n\n"}

During junior high, high school, and college, he performed in the bands Cow Shrapnel, Waterfront, and Sixth Hour, all of which also featured another future Roadside Monument member, bassist Todd Florence. \n\nRoadside was signed to Tooth & Nail Records only about four months after they formed in 1994, because they had good fortune in being discovered by Brandon Ebel. They released their Tooth & Nail debut, a 7-inch vinyl EP called \"My Life Is Green\", in 1995.\n\nRoadside Monument followed up their debut with their first full length \"Beside This Brief Hexagonal\" also in 1996. After the release of this album, complications emerged with keeping the band together due to medical issues and other obligations. After the other members departed, Lorig was left to find Matt Johnson (of Blenderhead) on drums and Johnathan Ford on bass. Lorig, Ford and Johnson became the core of Roadside Monument, and its sole members in all future releases. In 1997, \"Eight Hours Away from Being a Man\" was released, along with a pair of split EPs (with Puller and Frodus). \"Eight Hours Away from Being a Man\" was the album in which they became a prominent band on the Tooth & Nail roster, gaining popularity in the indie rock, emo and Christian underground music scenes.\n\nRoadside Monument broke up after the Cornerstone Festival in 1998, when Ford moved to Chicago, Illinois. They had already written and recorded another album, called \"I Am the Day of Current Taste\", which was released several months after their breakup. \n\nIn 2002, Ford returned to Seattle, and Roadside Monument reunited as an indie band. The new incarnation of the band played local shows, toured with Pedro the Lion and lasted for about one year, when Johnson decided to end the band again because of an inability to be a part of a full-time touring band. During this short time that the band re-united they created several new songs, including \"Zzyzx\" which was recorded during a live performance at Cornerstone 2002, and subsequently released via the band's official Web site.\n\nSince their breakup, Roadside Monument's members have participated in a variety of bands:\n\nThroughout their history, Roadside Monument has had several clashes with some Christian bookstore chains, who cited their songs as being \"controversial\". Examples of such songs included \"Sperm Ridden Burden\" (which Lorig said Ford wrote about seeing a child on a bus who was being raised by a single mother) and \"O.J. Simpson House Auction\" (the news on television when Lorig was looking for the title to the song he was working on). The band members did not mind that their music was not being sold in Christian bookstores, because they preferred to think of themselves as a \"band\" rather than as a \"Christian band\". In an interview with HM Magazine soon after their breakup, drummer Matt Johnson said, \"... I think the problem comes in when you start using the word 'Christian' as an adjective. And when I start hearing talk like that, my first inclination is to run totally in the opposite direction... It's just a debate that I've been over and over with people so much, that I'm not even sure what to say anymore. It's like, I'm a Christian and I play music, and if that means my band is a 'Christian band', then whatever.\"\n\nMany fans of Roadside Monument like the band because of their creative sound. They are credited as being key contributors to the original emo sub-culture and sound of indie rock which existed in the mid to late nineties. Their songs featured unique structure that was a blatant rejection of the verse/chorus structure followed by many popular songs. In addition, their unusual guitar parts, abnormal rhythms, and abrupt tempo changes, topped off by Lorig's emotional vocals, gained them acclaim and made the band's style almost unable to be labeled. Indeed, reviewers of the band would describe them as emo, math rock, or just regular rock.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has dark green leaves and summer flowers ranging from pale lavender, or pink to white. The closely related plant, summer savory (\"Satureja hortensis\" L.) is an annual plant.\n\nIt grows to between tall. The leathery, dark green leaves are opposite, oval-lanceolate, (or needle-like, 1–2 cm long and 5 mm broad. The flowers appear in summer, between July and October, and range from pale lavender or pink to white. The flowers are smaller than summer savoury flowers.\n\nIt contains carvacrol, a monoterpenoid phenol.\n\nIt was first published by Carl Linnaeus in his book Species Plantarum on page 568 in 1753.\n\nThe Latin specific epithet \"montana\" refers to mountains or coming from mountains.\n\nAlso commonly known as 'mountain savory'.\n\n\"Satureja montana\" is native to temperate areas between Europe, the Mediterranean, and Africa.\n\nIt has been naturalised in Great Britain.\n\nIt can be found growing in old walls, on dry banks and rocks on hillsides, or rocky mountain slopes. Usually on calcareous, or alkaline soils.\n\nThere is evidence of its use about 2000 years ago by the ancient Romans and Greeks.\n\nEasy to grow, it makes an attractive border plant for any culinary herb garden. It requires six hours of sun a day in soil that drains well. In temperate climates it goes dormant in winter, putting out leaves on the bare stems again in the spring – do not cut the plant back, all those stems which appear dead will leaf out again. It is hardy and has a low bunching habit. It can be used within a herb garden as an edging plant.\n\nIt is hardy to USDA Zone 4.\n\nIt can be propagated from softwood cuttings.\n\nIt is used as a companion plant for beans, keeping bean weevils away, and also plant with roses, reducing mildew and aphids.\n\n\"S. montana\" 'Nana' is a known dwarf cultivar.\n\"S. montana\" 'Prostrate White' is a small white flowered form.\n\nIn cooking, winter savory has a reputation for going very well with both beans and meats, very often lighter meats such as chicken or turkey, and can be used in stuffing. It can also be used in soups and sauces. It has a strong flavour (more than summer savory), while uncooked but loses much of its flavour under prolonged cooking. It can be added to breadcrumbs, as a coating to various meats including trout. \nWinter savory has been purported to have antiseptic, aromatic, carminative, and digestive benefits. It has also been used as an expectorant and in the treatment of bee stings, or insect bites, by the use of a poultice of the leaves. The plant has a stronger action than the closely related summer savory.\n\nTaken internally, it is said to be a remedy for colic and a cure for flatulence, whilst it is also used to treat gastro-enteritis, cystitis, nausea, diarrhoea, bronchial congestion, sore throat and menstrual disorders. It should not be prescribed for pregnant women.\n\nTherapeutic-grade oil has been determined to inhibit growth of \"Candida albicans\".\n\nThe plant is harvested in the summer when in flower and can be used fresh or dried. The essential oil forms an ingredient in lotions for the scalp in cases of incipient baldness. An ointment made from the plant is used externally to relieve arthritic joints.\n\nIn traditional herbal medicine, summer savory was believed to be an aphrodisiac, while winter savory was believed to inhibit sexual desire (an anaphrodisiac). French herbalist Maurice Messegue claimed that savory was 'the herb of happiness'.\n\n"}
{"id": "1817916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817916", "title": "Corteo", "text": "Corteo\n\nCorteo is a Cirque du Soleil touring production that premiered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on April 21, 2005. \n\nAs of May 24, 2005, Cirque du Soleil had broken its record of spectators for the première location in Montreal; more than 200,000 people had viewed the production, far outpacing the prior record of 180,000 tickets sold for \"Varekai\" during its première. The show's final performance under the big top took place in Quito, Ecuador on 13 December 2015. On November 20, 2017, Cirque du Soleil announced that the show would once again set out on tour, this time in the arena format. The re-staged show premiered March 2, 2018 in New Orleans.\n\n\"Cortéo\"—an Italian word meaning \"cortège\" or procession—is a contemporary circus show about a clown who watches his own funeral taking place in a carnival-like atmosphere. It was partly inspired by \"The Grand Parade: Portrait of the Artist as Clown\" on display at the National Gallery of Canada and the movie \"I Clowns\" by Federico Fellini.\n\nDirected by Daniele Finzi Pasca, founder of the Swiss clown troupe Teatro Sunil and director of several shows by Cirque Éloize, \"Cortéo\" was presented in the round under a large tent. The action took place on a large circular stage consisting of concentric rotating rings. This allowed one area of the stage to rotate while another remained stationary. At times during the performance, the stage was divided by a large curtain illustrated with a painting called the \"Cortéo Procession\". There were entrances/exits at either side of the circular stage.\n\nDuring its big top tour, Cirque du Soleil divided the \"Grand Chapiteau\" in two by creating a stage that spanned the diameter of the tent, thus allowing the audience to face one another as well as giving a performer's perspective to them. Built into the long stage were two turntables with a diameter of . \"Corteo\"'s set had a special overhead transport mechanism, dubbed the \"Patience\", which had two rails fitted with four platform-like carts each. Each cart had a lifting capacity of and a top speed of . At its highest point, it was above the stage.\n\nThe curtains utilized in \"Corteo\" were painted in watercolors and were inspired by a painting from 1885 by Adolphe Willette. The Roll Drop curtains were about in width and in height. The inner curtains were constructed in Canada and sent to France to be painted. Each of the four inner curtains took nearly two weeks to be individually painted.\n\nThe design on the center stage was a labyrinth which exactly matches the proportions and size of the one on the floor of Chartres Cathedral.\n\nThe principal characters of \"Corteo\" were clowns, as is fitting for a clown's funeral, but 62 artists comprised the full troupe.\n\n\nThe acts in \"Corteo\" brought together the passion of acting with the grace and power of acrobatics.\n\n\n\n\n\"Corteo\"'s costume designer, Dominique Lemieux, utilized \"matériaux bruts et des matières nobles\" (French for \"raw and luxury fabrics\") to create a wardrobe that accentuated the artists' natural beauty. The finer details of the outfits were inspired by European styles between 1890 and 1930. The color palette chosen was soft in nature, including blue, pink, and fuchsia along with copper and gold hues. In order to create a worn-in, hand-me-down style of clothing, the costumes were airbrushed and dyed. Common fabrics throughout the wardrobe included silk, linen, and cotton, which were adorned with beaded lace, sequins, and gemstones. In total, more than 900 fabrics were utilized to create the 184 costumes. If back-up and rotational costumes are to be taken into account, the total costume count was around 450 costumes with 284 rotations. During each show day, 12 to 16 hours of ironing was necessary to prepare the costumes.\n\n\n\"Corteo\"’s score was originally composed by Philippe Leduc and Maria Bonzanigo. Additional composers including Jean-François Côté and Michel A. Smith subsequently reworked several pieces. Show director Daniele Finzi Pasca contributed lyrics. Cirque du Soleil Musique released an album of music from \"Corteo\" on 23 September 2006 in Canada, and 7 October 2006 in the US. \"Corteo\" was one of the first Cirque du Soleil CDs to feature multiple composers.\n\nThe album features the contributions of 61 musicians and singers, a 16-piece choir and a 13-piece string section. \"Corteo\"’s lyrics are sung in Italian, French, and Spanish.\n\nListed below are the tracks from the CD, alongside the acts during which they were played.\n\n\n\n\n\nCirque du Soleil released their film adaptation of \"Corteo\" on April 11, 2006. It was filmed in Canada in 2005. During the Creative Arts ceremony on September 8, 2007, it won the Emmy award for Outstanding Picture Editing for a Special. The following day, it also won a Gémeaux (Gemini Award) for \"Meilleur montage - humour, variétés, arts de la scène\" (best editing - humor, entertainment, performing arts).\n\nFollowing Corteo's première in Montreal in 2005, it was seen by more than 5 million spectators. Corteo celebrated its 1000th show in January 2008 in San Diego; its 1500th show in June 2009 in Nagoya, Japan; its 2000th show in September 2010 in Kazan, Russia, and its 3500th show in March 2015 in Bogota, Colombia.\n\n\"Corteo\" began (like all touring Cirque du Soleil shows) with a North American tour (2005-2008), which was followed by a Japanese tour in 2009. The show did not go on to any other cities in Asia or Oceania, but instead proceeded to a European tour (2010-2013) and then a South American tour (2013-2015).\n\nThe show's Big Top final performance took place in Quito, Ecuador on 13 December 2015.\n\nThe show has been adapted to an arena format and premiered in New Orleans, Louisiana, kicking off a two-year tour across North America in March 2018.\nReviews of \"Corteo\" in the news media were mixed. In 2005, the \"Toronto Sun\" found the show \"brilliant\" but the \"Oakland Tribune\" concluded that it merely \"settles for being very good\". \"The New York Times\" gave a lukewarm review in May 2006, stating at best that it \"will pass the time pleasantly for those who have seen and enjoyed previous Cirque extravaganzas\". Although \"The Washington Post\" named it an \"Editors' Pick\" in November 2006, the headline of its article noted, \"Some of the Thrill Is Gone\". \"LA Weekly\" in 2007 praised the acrobats but criticized the clowns. A March 2008 review in \"The Oregonian\" was similarly reserved, stating that there is a \"disparity in the quality of the acts\" and a \"lack of a cohesive ending\". Sun Media was enthusiastic about an Ottawa performance of \"Corteo\" in September 2008.\n\nIn May 2018, \"The Daily Nebraskan\" praised the show, saying it left the audience dazzled.\n\n"}

His first work as a cartoonist was at age 18 for the \"Detroit Mirror\", which ceased publication in August 1932. He then freelanced, and a ginger ale client kept his cartoons in newspapers, buses and streetcars and on billboards. He moved to California in 1935 and began work with Disney, but after two weeks he was unemployed when the studio closed down for the summer.\n\nZekley was broke and in dire straits in 1935 when Charles McManus, the brother of George McManus, saw him drawing on a restaurant tablecloth, liked what he saw and decided to introduce Zekley to his brother, kicking off a series of events described by TV writer-producer Mark Evanier:\n\nIn the 1930s, Zekley was initially paid $50 a week, doing lettering and inking, but he soon began collaborating with McManus on both the penciled art and the writing. During World War II, he was in the Army and drew cartoons for the military. Since he was stationed near McManus, he continued to work on \"Bringing Up Father\" throughout the WWII years. During his two decades with McManus, Zekley thought highly of the cartoonist, calling him \"my closest pal, mentor, confidant, even surrogate father.\" After McManus' death in 1954, King Features replaced McManus and Zekley with Vernon Greene.\n\nZekley worked on other comic strips—\"Dud Dudley\", \"Paps Younger\", \"Peachy Keen\" and \"Popsie\"—but none of them were particularly successful. He also contributed to the comic book \"First Love\", published by Harvey Comics.\n\nZekley created what he called \"murals without morals\", and in 1940 he was commissioned to paint a mural for Clark Gable's ranch house.\n\nTab Hunter, in \"The Tab Hunter Show\" (1960–61), portrayed Paul Morgan, a 29-year-old cartoonist whose comic strip \"Bachelor at Large\" profiled his amorous adventures around Malibu, and the comic strips seen on camera were drawn by Zekley,\n\nZekley started his own company, Sponsored Comics, which created promotional comic books for businesses, including McDonald's. For ten years, he drew special comics for the Squirrel Club. He also worked on \"PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly\", a US Army publication created by Will Eisner.\n\nZekley spent his spare time playing golf and collecting fine art. He died in 2005 and was buried in Hillside Memorial Park and Mortuary in Los Angeles, California.\n\n"}

Known for his views on the philosophy of Parkour and freerunning, Foucan stresses the need for training in the basics of both for individual safety and to maintain a positive public perception of the activities. As creator of freerunning, Foucan has stipulated its values:\n\nHe became known in the United Kingdom after Mike Christie's Channel 4 documentary \"Jump London\" in September 2003 and the subsequent documentary \"Jump Britain\". In addition to those programmes, Foucan appeared as Mollaka in the 21st James Bond film \"Casino Royale\". He spent three months in the Bahamas on the film. Foucan appeared in the music video for Madonna's 2005 single \"Jump\", accompanying the singer on her 2006 \"Confessions Tour\". He helped K-Swiss develop the Ariake, the first in a line of five freerunning-shoe models. Foucan appeared in a trailer for the game \"Mirror's Edge\". His most-recent role is assassin Anton Bogart in \"The Tournament\".\n\nIt was reported on 3 January 2012 that Foucan would be among 15 celebrities in the seventh series of \"Dancing on Ice\". On 19 February he was eliminated in a double Ultimate Skills skate-off with Heidi Range.\nFoucan is working with a clothing line, Black Mamba Elite - Motivational Apparel, in releasing his own signature range through the UK company. In 2018 he appeared in the British TV series Ninja Warrior.\n\nFoucan attributed the name free running to Guillaume Pelletier, who he had worked with at the time of \"Jump London\". The word \"freerunning\" was coined during the filming of \"Jump London\" to present Parkour to the English-speaking world. Since then it has come to represent Foucan's methodology, which focuses on innovation and expression rather than Parkour's speed and efficiency.\n\nFoucan explains freerunning:\nFoucan has described the core value\n\nHe defines Freerunning as a discipline for self-development, following one's own way. Foucan's dissatisfaction with Parkour's limited creativity and self-expression motivated him to develop a similar art of movement which became known as freerunning.\n\nHe reported that he was forced to define free running as a discipline separate from parkour because others had rejected his practice as not being within their definition of parkour. For example, David Belle and other Parkour enthusiasts have criticized Foucan and freerunning:\n\nFoucan has described freerunning as a process of movement aimed at self-development through physical activity, play, and creativity. He regards it as an act symbolic of leaving \"fixed path and social systems\".\n\nFoucan appeared in Ninja Warrior UK 4 and cleared the Heats, but his run in the Semi-Final has not been broadcast yet.\n\n\n\n"}

Similar allowances are in effect for calculating taxable income for provincial purposes.\n\nCapital property eligible for CCA excludes:\n\n\nCCA is calculated on \"undepreciated capital cost\" (\"UCC\"), which is generally defined as:\n\n\nWhere the UCC for a class is negative, a \"recapture of depreciation\" is deemed to take place, thus adding to taxable income and bringing the balance of UCC back to zero. Where UCC for a class is positive, but all assets with respect to that class have been disposed of, a \"terminal loss\" is deemed to take place, thus deducting from taxable income and bringing the balance of UCC back to zero.\n\nCCA itself is generally calculated using the following items:\n\nFor assets subject to the full-year rule:\n\nformula_1\n\nFor assets subject to the half-year rule:\n\nformula_2\n\nUnder the \"Income Tax Act\":\n\n\nPart XI of the \"Income Tax Regulations\" provides for the calculation rules for CCA, and Schedule II outlines the various classes of capital property that are eligible for it. Special rules are in place to deem certain assets to be in separate classes, thus not becoming part of the general pool for the class. Certain elections are available to taxpayers to transfer or reclassify assets from one class to another.\n\nAdditional allowances are prescribed with respect to specified circumstances. Specialized calculations for certain classes are also outlined in:\n\n\nPart XVII of the \"Income Tax Regulations\" provides for specialized calculation rules for CCA with respect to capital property acquired for use in earning income from farming and fishing.\n\nCCA is calculated under the half-year rule, except where otherwise specified, with respect to the following classes.\n\nIn contrast to the practice followed in the United States for depreciation there is no penalty for failing to claim Capital Cost Allowance. Where a taxpayer claims less than the amount of CCA to which he is entitled the pool remains intact, and available for claims in future years. Unclaimed amounts are not subject to recapture.\n\nBecause assets subject to CCA are generally pooled by class, and CCA is generally calculated on a declining-balance basis, specific techniques have been developed to determine the net present after-tax value of such capital investments. For standard scenarios under the full-year rule and half-year rule models, the following standard items are employed:\n\nMore specialized analysis would need to be applied to:\n\nCapital cost allowance will be calculated as follows:\n\nTherefore, the Tax shield in year \"n\" = formula_3, and the present value of the taxation credits will be equal to formula_4\n\nAs this is an example of a converging series for a geometric progression, this can be simplified further to become:\n\nformula_5\n\nThe net present after-tax value of a capital investment then becomes:\n\nformula_6\n\nFor capital investments where CCA is calculated under the half-year rule, the CCA tax shield calculation is modified as follows:\n\nformula_7\n\nTherefore, the net present after-tax value of a capital investment is determined to be:\n\nformula_8\n\nIn cases where claims have been contested or disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency, the Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted the Capital Cost Allowance in a fairly broad manner, allowing deductions on property which was owned for a very brief period of time, and property which is leased back to the vendor from which it originated. These decisions demonstrate the flexibility of the Capital Cost Allowance as a legal tax reduction strategy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1817986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817986", "title": "Advertising campaign", "text": "Advertising campaign\n\nAn advertising campaign is a series of advertisement messages that share a single idea and theme which make up an integrated marketing communication (IMC). An IMC is a platform in which a group of people can group their ideas, beliefs, and concepts into one large media base. Advertising campaigns utilize diverse media channels over a particular time frame and target identified audiences.\n\nThe campaign theme is the central message that will be received in the promotional activities and is the prime focus of advertising campaign, as it sets the motif for the series of individual advertisements and other marketing communications that will be used. The campaign themes are usually produced with the objective of being used for a significant period but many of them are temporal due to factors like being not effective or market conditions, competition and marketing mix.\n\nAdvertising campaigns are built to accomplish a particular objective or a set of objectives. Such objectives usually include establishing a brand, raising brand awareness, aggrandizing the rate of conversions/sales. The rate of success or failure in accomplishing these goals is reckoned via effectiveness measures. There are 5 key points at which an advertising campaign must consider to ensure an effective campaign. These points are, integrated marketing communications, media channels, positioning, the communications process diagram and touch points.\n\nIntegrated marketing communication (IMC) is a conceptual approach used by the majority of organizations to develop a strategic plan on how they are going to broadcast their marketing and advertising campaigns. Recently there has been a shift in the way marketers and advertisers interact with their consumers and now see it as a conversation between Advertising/ Marketing teams and consumers. IMC has emerged as a key strategy for organizations to manage customer experiences in the digital age. The more traditional advertising practices such as newspapers, billboards, and magazines are still used but fail to have the same effect now as they did in previous years.\n\nThe importance of the IMC is to make the marketing process seamless for both the brand and the consumer. IMC attempts to meld all aspects of marketing into one cohesive piece. This includes sales promotion, advertising, public relations, direct marketing, and social media. The entire point of IMC is to have all of these aspects of marketing work together as a unified force. This can be done through methods, channels, and activities all while using a media platform. The end goal of IMC is to get the brands message across to consumers in the most convenient way possible.\n\nThe advantage of using IMC is that it has the ability to communicate the same message through several channels to create brand awareness. IMC is the most cost-effective solution when compared to mass media advertising to interact with target consumers on a personal level. IMC also benefits small businesses, as they are able to submerge their consumers with communication of various kinds in a way that pushes them through the research and buying stages creating a relationship and dialogue with their new customer. Popular and obvious examples of IMC put into action are the likes of direct marketing to the consumer that the organization already has a knowledge that the person is interested in the brand by gathering personal information about them from when they previously shopped there and then sending mail, emails, texts and other direct communication with the person. In-store sales promotions are tactics such as ‘30% off’ sales or offering loyalty cards to consumers to build a relationship. Television and radio advertisement are also a form of advertising strategy derived from IMC. All of the components of IMC play an important role and a company may or may not choose to implement any of the integration strategies\n\nMedia channels, also known as, marketing communications channels, are used to create a connection with the target consumer. Traditional methods of communication with the consumer include newspapers, magazines, Radio, television, billboards, telephone, post and door to door sales. These are just a few of the historically traditional methods.\n\nAlong with traditional media channels, comes new and upcoming media channels. Social media has begun to play a very large role in the way media and marketing intermingle to reach a consumer base. Social media has the power to reach a wider audience. Depending on the age group and demographic, social media can influence a company's overall image. Using social media as a marketing tool has become a widely popular method for branding. A brand has the chance to create an entire social media presence based around their own specific targeted community.\n\nWith advancements in digital communications channels, marketing communications allow for the possibility of two-way communications where an immediate consumer response can be elicited. Digital communications tools include: websites, blogs, social media, email, mobile, and search engines as a few examples. It is important for an advertising campaign to carefully select channels based on where their target consumer spends time to ensure market and advertising efforts are maximized.\n\nIn the rapidly changing marketing and advertising environment, exposure to certain consumer groups and target audiences through traditional media channels has blurred. These traditional media channels are defined as print, broadcast, out-of-home and direct mail. The introduction of various new modern-day media channels has altered their traditional advantages and disadvantages. It is imperative to the effectiveness of the Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) strategy that exposure to certain demographics, consumer groups and target audiences is anticipated to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communications impact.\n\nPrint media is mainly defined as newspapers and magazines. With the transition in last decade [2006 – 2016] to digital information on phones, computers and tablets, the demographic that still are exposed to traditional print media is going to be older. It is also estimated that there will be a reduction of print material in coming years. This has to be taken into account by the advertisers and in some cases, they could use this to their advantage. Newspapers advantages would be that it is low cost, timely, reader controls exposure and has moderate coverage to the older generations in western society. Disadvantages would obviously be the aging demographic, short life, clutter and low attention-getting capabilities. Magazines are similar in some cases but have defined differences as they are a niche product increasing segmentation potential; they also have high informational content and longevity. Disadvantages are they are visual only, lack of flexibility and a long lead time for advertisement placement.\n\nTraditional broadcast media's primary platforms are television and radio. These are still relatively prominent in modern-day society, but with the emergence of online content such as YouTube, Instagram and Vine it would difficult to anticipate where the market is headed in the next decade. Televisions advantages are that it has mass coverage, high reach, quality reputation, low post per exposure and impacts human senses. Disadvantages would be that it has low selectivity, short message life and high production costs. Alternatively, radio offers flexibility, high frequency and low advertising & production costs. Disadvantages to radio are that its audio only, low attention-getting and short message.\n\nOut-of-home (OOH) media a broad marketing concept that is no longer relegated to large, static billboards on the side of motorways. More current and innovative approaches to OOH media range from street furniture to aerial blimps. Due to the constant and contemporary nature of the outdoors there will always be new ways in which a campaign can revitalize this media channel. Advantages would be the accessibility and reach, geographic flexibility and relatively low cost. Disadvantages to OOH media are that it has a short life, difficult to measure / control and it can convey poor brand image.\n\nDirect mail is classified as messages sent directly to consumers through the mail delivery service. One of the more ‘dated’ media channels and in the modern day has very little advantages, other than it is highly selective and has high information content. Disadvantages are that it promotes a poor brand image – junk mail and that it has a high cost to contact ratio.\n\nWhen an organisation begins to construct their advertising campaign they need to research each and every aspect of their target market and target consumer. The target consumer is the person or group of people who is most likely to buy from an organisation, he is also called 'potential customer'. A target consumer can be categorized by several key characteristics; Gender, age, occupation, marital status, geographical location, behavioral, level of income and education to name the main factors. This process is called segmenting customers on the basis of demographics.\n\nGender is simply whether a person is male or female. Age is usually broken up into bracketed intervals of ten or so years, for example, a person's age between 15–25 years old. By understanding which age bracket the target market falls into the advertisers can position their efforts accordingly. Occupation is also known as a profession and refers to what a person does for a living; this could be a particular job, student, unemployed etc. A person's marital status defines whether they are married or unmarried. Geographical location is a broad term specifying a particular area or place within a given country, state/ city, suburb or street as some examples. Income refers to how much money a person is earning annually which can help identify how much money they have left over after expenses to potential spend on a brand. The final factor to explain is education, whether a person went to school or not, what school they attended, what standard of education they have, diplomas, certificates, graduate, degrees, masters, Ph.D. or other forms of defining educational factors. Knowing this information can help an advertiser understand their target markets level of thinking to help adapt the advertising campaign to be understood by the given target consumer/s.\n\nFor a business to successfully find the appropriate target market for their products or services, it is important that they segment the market to better decide which customers to target. This is best done when the market is segmented into the four following areas: geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioural.\n\nGeographic segmentation involves the market being divided into different nations, regions, states, counties, cities, or neighbourhoods. Segmenting the target market geographically is effective as different areas have different needs, which can be affected by weather, fashion, etc.\n\nDemographic segmentation separates the market into groups according to age, gender, family size, income, occupation, education, religion, nationality, and race. It is important to note that this is the easiest and least expensive way to segment the market, as the research has already been done.\n\nPsychographic segmentation is the process of markets being divided into groups based on social class, personality characteristics, and values.\n\nBehavioural segmentation “divides a market into groups based on consumer knowledge, attitude, use, or response to a product” (Krause, T. 2007). This is believed to be the best starting point, when a business is building a market segment. The behavioural segment is important because it focuses on why consumers consume products. For example, during Father's day and Mother's day, flowers were promoted due to the heavy demand of flowers during these holidays.\n\nDefining the target market helps businesses and individuals design a marketing campaign. This in turns helps businesses and individuals avoid waste and get their advertisements to likely customers. While attempting to find the correct target market it is important to focus on specific groups of individuals that will benefit. By marketing to specific groups of individuals that specifically relate to the product, businesses and individuals will more quickly and efficiently find those who will purchase the product. Businesses and individuals that monitor their existing data (customer and sales data) will find it easier to define their target market, and surveying existing customers will assist in finding more customers. Avoiding inefficiencies when finding a target market is equally as important. Wasting time and money advertising to a large group of potential customers is inefficient if only a handful become customers. A focused plan that reaches a tiny audience can work out well if they're already interested in a product. Over time target markets can change. People interested today might not be interested tomorrow, and those not interested in the present time, might become interested over time. Analysing sales data and customer information helps businesses and individuals understand when their target market is increasing or decreasing.\n\nThere are many advantages that are associated with finding a target market. One advantage is the “ability to offer the right product” (Suttle. R. 2016) through knowing the age and needs of the customer willing to purchase the item. Another advantage of target marketing assists businesses in understanding what price the customer will pay for the products or service. Businesses are also more efficient and effective at advertising their product, because they “reach the right consumers with messages that are more applicable” (Suttle. R. 2016).\n\nHowever, there are several disadvantages that can be associated with target marketing. Firstly, finding a target market is expensive. Often businesses conduct primary research to find whom their target market is, which usually involves hiring a research agency, which can cost “tens of thousands of dollars” (Suttle, R. 2016). Finding one's target market is also time-consuming, as it often “requires a considerable amount of time to identify a target audience” (Suttle, R. 2016). Also focusing on finding a target market can make one overlook other customers that may be in a product. Businesses or individuals may find that their ‘average customer’ might not include those that fall just outside of the average customers “demographics” (Suttle, R. 2016), which will limit the sale of their products. The last disadvantage to note is the ethical ramifications that are associated with target marketing. An example of this would be a “beer company that may target less educated, poorer people with larger-sized bottles” (Suttle, R. 2016).\n\nIn advertising various brands compete to overtake the perceptual mapping in a consumers mind. Everyday consumers view advertising and rank particular brands compared to their competitors. Individuals rank these specific brands in an order of what is most important to them. For example, a person may compare brands of cars based on how sporty they think they look, affordability, practicality and classiness. How one person perceives a brand is different from another but is largely left to the advertising campaign to manipulate and create the perception that they want a consumer to envision\n\nPositioning is an important marketing concept that businesses implement to market their products or services. The positioning concept focuses on creating an image that will best attract the intended audience. Businesses that implement the positioning concept focus on promotion, price, placement and product. When the positioning concept is effective and productive it elevates the marketing efforts made by a business, and assists the buyer in purchasing the product.\n\nThe positioning process is imperative in marketing because of the specific level of consumer-based recognition is involved. A company must create a trademark brand for themselves in order to be recognizable by a broad range of consumers. For example, a fast food restaurant positions itself as fast, cheap, and delicious. They are playing upon their strengths and most visible characteristics. On the other hand, a luxury car brand will position its brand as a stylish and expensive platform because they want to target a specific brand very different from the fast food brand.\n\nFor the positioning concept to be effective one must focus on the concepts of promotion, price, place and product.\n\nThere are three basic objectives of promotion, which include: presenting product information to targeted business customers and consumers, increase demand among the target market, and differentiating a product and creating a brand identity. Tools that can be used to achieve these objectives are advertising, public relations, personal selling, direct marketing, and sales promotion.\n\nPrice of an object is crucial in the concept of positioning. Adjusting or decreasing the product price has a profound impact on the sales of the product, and should complement the other parts of the positioning concept. The price needs to ensure survival, increase profit, generate survival, gain market shares, and establish an appropriate image.\n\nPositioning a product is essential in the positioning concept. It is the process marketers use to communicate their products’ attributes to the intended target market. In order for products to be successful businesses must focus on the customer needs, competitive pressures, available communication channels and carefully crafted key messages.\n\nProduct Positioning presents several advantages in the advertising campaign, and to the businesses/ individuals that implement it. Positioning connects with superior aspects of a product and matches “them with consumers more effectively than competitors” (Jaideep, S. 2016). Positioning can also help businesses or individuals realise the consumer's expectations of the product/s they are willing to purchase from them. Positioning a product reinforces the companies name, product and brand. It also makes the brand popular and strengthens customer loyalty. Product benefits to customers are better advertised through positioning the product, which results in more interest and attention of consumers. This also attracts different types of consumers as products posse's different benefits that attract different groups of consumers, for example: a shoe that is advertised for playing sports, going for walks, hiking and casual wear will attract different groups of consumers. Another advantage of positioning is the competitive strength it gives to businesses/ individuals and their products, introducing new products successfully to the market and communicating new and varied features that are added to a product later on.\n\nThe Communication of processes diagram refers to the order of operation an advertising campaign pieces together the flow of communication between a given organisation and the consumer. The diagram usually flows left to right (unless shown in a circular array) starting with the source. An advertising campaign uses the communication process diagram to ensure all the appropriate steps of communication are being taken in order.\n\nThe source is the person or organisation that has a message they want to share with potential consumers. An example of this is Vodafone wanting to tell their consumers and new consumers of a new monthly plan.\n\nThe diagram then moves on to encoding which consists of the organisation putting messages, thoughts and ideas into a symbolic form that be interpreted by the target consumer using symbols or words.\n\nThe third stage in the diagram is channel message. This occurs when the information or meaning the source wants to convoy, is put into a form to easily be transmitted to the targeted audience. This also includes the method that communication gets from the source to the receiver. Examples of this is Vodafone advertising on TV, bus stops and university campuses as students may be the intended consumer for the new plan.\n\nDecoding is the processes that the viewer interprets the message that the source sent. Obviously it is up to the source to ensure that the message encoded well enough so that it is received as intended.\n\nThe receiver is also known as the viewer or potential consumer. This is the person who interprets the source message through channeling whether they are the intended target audience or not. Every day we interpret different advertisements even if we are not the target audience for that advertisement.\n\nIn between these steps there are external factors acting as distractions, these factors are called noise. Noise distorts the way the message gets to the intended target audience. These distractions are from all other forms of advertising and communication from every other person or organisation. Examples of noise are State of mind, unfamiliar language, unclear message, Values, Attitudes, Perceptions, Culture and Knowledge of similar products or services to name a few forms of noise.\n\nFinally there is the response or feedback. This is the receiver's reaction to the communication of message and the way they understood it. Feedback relates to the way sales react as well as the interest or questions that arise in relation to the message put out.\n\nWhen considering touch points in an advertising campaign a brand looks Multisensory touch points. These touch points help the brand to develop a point of contact between themselves and the consumer. Modern day advancements in various forms of technology have made it easier for consumers to engage with brands in numerous ways. The most successful touch points are those that create value in the consumer and brands relationship. Common examples of touch points include social media links, QR codes, person handing out flyers about a particular brand, billboards, web sites and various other methods that connect the brand and consumer.\n\nMulti sensory touch points are subconscious yet helps use to recognise brands through characteristic identified through human sensors. These characteristics could be shape, colour, textures, sounds, smell or tastes associated with a given brand. It is important for an advertising campaign to consider sensory cues into their campaign as market places continue to become increasingly competitive and crowded. Anyone of the given sensory characteristics may remind a person of the brand they best associate with. A prime example of this is Red Bull who use the colour, shapes and size of their cans to best relate their product to success and winning. A taller can looks like the 1st place podium when placed next to competitors, the design looks like the finish flag in racing representing winning. The opportunity for an advertising campaign to succeed is significantly increased with the use of multi sensory touch points used as a point of difference between brands.\n\nGuerrilla marketing is an advertising strategy which increases brand exposure through the use of unconventional campaigns which initiate social discussion and \"buzz\". This can often be achieved with lower budgets than conventional advertising methods, allowing small and medium-sized businesses the chance to compete against larger competitors. Through unconventional methods, inventiveness and creativity, guerrilla marketing leaves the receiver with a long lasting impression of the brand as most guerrilla marketing campaigns target the receivers at a personal level, taking them by surprise and may incorporate an element of shock. Guerrilla marketing is typically executed exclusively in public places, including streets, parks, shopping centres etc., to ensure maximum audience resulting in further discussion on social media.\n\nGuerrilla marketing is the term used for several types of marketing categories including street marketing, ambient marketing, presence marketing, alternative marketing, experimental marketing, grassroots marketing, wild posting, guerrilla projection advertising, undercover marketing and astroturfing.\n\nJay Conrad Levinson coined the term \"Guerrilla Marketing\" with his 1984 book of the same name. Through the enhancement of technology and common use of internet and mobile phones, marketing communication has become more affordable and guerrilla marketing is on the rise, allowing the spread of newsworthy guerrilla campaigns.\n\nWhen establishing a guerrilla marketing strategy, there are seven elements to a clear and logical approach. Firstly, write a statement that identifies the purpose of the strategy. Secondly define how the purpose will be achieved concentrating on the key advantages. Next Levinson (1989) suggests writing a descriptive summary on the target market or consumers. The fourth element is to establish a statement that itemizes the marketing tools and methods planning to be used in the strategy (for example, radio advertising during 6.30am – 9am on weekday mornings or window displays that are regularly updated). The fifth step is to create a statement which positions the brand/product/company in the market. Define the brands characteristics and give it an identity is the sixth element. Lastly, clearly identify a budget which will be put solely towards marketing going forward.\n\nFor a successful overall guerrilla marketing campaign, combine the above steps with seven winning actions. These seven principles are commitment – stick to the marketing plan without changing it; investment – appreciate that marketing is an investment, consistency – ensure the marketing message and strategy remains consistent across all forms of, confidence – show confidence in the commitment to the guerrilla marketing strategy, patience – time and dedication to the strategy, assortment – incorporate different methods of advertising and marketing for optimum results, and subsequent – build customer loyalty and retention though follow up marketing post-sale.\n\nLevinson suggests guerrilla marketing tactics were initiated to enable small businesses with limited financial resources to gain an upper hand on the corporate giants who had unlimited budgets and resources at their disposal. Large companies cottoned on to the success of guerrilla marketing and have had hundreds of effective attention grabbing campaigns using the strategies originally designed for smaller businesses with minimal marketing budgets.\n\nNon-traditional, unconventional and shocking campaigns are highly successful in obtaining media coverage and therefore brand awareness, albeit good or bad media attention. However, like most marketing strategies a bad campaign can backfire and damage profits and sales. Undercover marketing and astroturfing are two type of guerrilla marketing that are deemed as risky and can be detrimental to the company.\n\n“Advertising can be dated back to 4000 BC where Egyptians used papyrus to make sales messages and wall posters. Traditional advertising and marketing slowly developed over the centuries but never bloomed until early 1900s” (\"What Is Guerrilla Marketing?\", 2010). Guerrilla marketing are relatively simple, use tactics to advertise on a very small budget. It is to make a campaign that is “shocking, funny, unique, outrageous, clever and creative that people can’t stop talking about it” (Uk essays, 2016). Guerrilla marketing is different when compared to traditional marketing tactics (Staff, 2016). “Guerrilla marketing means going after conventional goals of profits, sales and growth but doing it by using unconventional means, such as expanding offerings during gloomy economic days to inspire customers to increase the size of each purchase” (Staff, 2016). Guerrilla marketing also suggests that rather than investing money, it is better to “invest time, energy, imagination and knowledge” (Staff, 2016) instead. Guerrilla marketing puts profit as their main priority not sales as their main focal point, this is done to urge the growth of geometrically by enlarging the size of each transactions. This all done through one of the most powerful marketing weapons around, the telephone. Research shows that it will always increases profits and sales. The term “guerrilla first appeared during the war of independence in Spain and Portugal at the beginning of the 19th century it can be translated as battle” (Uk essays, 2016). Even thou guerrilla marketing was aimed for small business; this did not stop bigger business from adopting the same ideology. “Larger business has been using unconventional marketing to complement their advertising campaigns, even then some marketers argue that when bigger business utilize guerrilla marketing tactics, it isn’t true guerrilla” (\"What Is Guerrilla Marketing?\", 2010). The reason being that larger companies have bigger budgets and usually their brands well established. In some cases, it is far riskier for a larger business to do guerrilla marketing tactics. Which can cause problem when their stunts become a flop when compared to smaller business, as they do not run as much risk, as most people will just write it off as another failed stunt. Many methods in guerrilla marketing consist of “graffiti (or reverse graffiti, where a dirty wall is selectively cleaned), interactive displays, intercept encounters in public spaces, flash mobs, or various PR stunts are often used.”\n\nSmall business use social media as a form of marketing. “Collecting billions of people around the world through a series of status updates, tweets, and other rich media” (\"Guerrilla Marketing Strategies for Small Businesses\", 2013). Social media is a powerful tool in the world of business. Guerrilla marketing strategies and tactics are a great and cost effective way to generate” awareness for business, products and services. To maximize full potential of marketing efforts, it's to blend them with a powerful and robust online marking strategy with a marketing automation software” (\"Guerrilla Marketing Strategies for Small Businesses\", 2013). Which can boost small businesses. Guerrilla tactics consist of instruments that have effects on the efforts. Some instruments are usually there to maximize the surprise effect and some of these instruments mainly cutting advertising costs.” Guerrilla marketing is a way of increasing the number of individuals exposed to the advertising with the cost of campaign. The instrument of diffusion helps to each a wide audience, which causes none or little cost because consumers (viral marketing) or the media (guerrilla PR) pass on the advertising message” (\"Guerrilla Marketing: The Nature of the Concept and Propositions for Further Research\", 2016). Guerrilla campaigns usually implement a free ride approach, this means that to cut their costs and increase the number of recipients simultaneously to maximize the low cost effect. For example, they will try to benefit from placing advertisements on big events e.g. sporting events. Guerrilla marketing was regarded to target existing customers rather than new ones, aiming to increase their engagement with a product and/ or brand. “When selecting audiences for a guerrilla message, a group that is already engaged with the product at some level is the best target; they will be quicker to recognize and respond to creative tactics, and more likely to share the experience with their friends, as social media has become a major feature of the market landscape, guerrilla marketing has shown to be particularly effective online. Consumers who regularly use social media are more likely to share their interactions with guerrilla marketing, and creative advertising can quickly go viral.”\n\n"}

He is deemed the founder and leading pioneer of the physical discipline Parkour, coining it based on his training and the teachings from his father Raymond Belle.\nBelle came to fame via his parkour videos and film appearances, such as \"District 13\", \"\", which were written and produced by Luc Besson, and the American remake \"Brick Mansions\". Belle has also consulted on the making of \"Babylon A.D.\", \"\", \"Colombiana\" and \"The Family\". He is the chair of the Parkour Committee of the International Federation of Gymnastics.\n\nBelle was born and raised in Fécamp, France, the son of Monique and Raymond Belle, in a modest family in the suburbs of Paris. His grandfather Gilbert Kitten, father Raymond, and brother Jean-François Belle have been highly skilled rescuers in the Military Paris Fire Brigade.\n\nIn 1984, at the age of 11, Belle moved to Lisses, France. He made close friends with a group of teenagers with similar physical passions who began training with him. Some of the friends that trained with David would later become known as the Yamakasi. Later in life, Belle spent time in the military and fire brigade with aspirations of following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps. He left soon after for personal reasons in order to dedicate himself to parkour.\n\nBelle later joined the Troupes de marine in Vannes, where he received a promotion, a gymnastic agility certificate of honour, and champion records for regimental rope-climbing (which his father had once held) and the Essonne obstacle course. He has however said that his taste and love for adventure and freedom did not go well with the regimented life of the military.\n\nUpon completing his national service, he worked in various professions including a warehouse worker, security guard and furniture salesman. He also spent 3 months in India studying kung fu. After his return he continued his training in parkour and filmed footage of his capabilities which he later turned into the famous \"Speed Air Man\" video. In 1997 the Stade 2 team (Francis Marroto, Pierre Sled and Pierre Salviac) were shown a video of Belle and decided to film a news feature about parkour.\n\nIn filming this news feature, the term Yamakasi was used for the first time in connection with the team. Belle did not approve of the name and felt like it did not give credit to his father, so he split from the group after the feature. Later Belle would go on to train other students who gave themselves the name 'tracer.' The spelling was later adapted to 'traceur', and has since been used to define a practitioner of parkour. However more recently, Belle claimed that \"A traceur is not a practitioner of parkour, a traceur is someone who is trying to understand parkour.\"\n\nBelle was first introduced to his acting career in a meeting with Hubert Koundé (\"La Haine\"), in order to discuss the success of parkour in cinema. He then began developing his acting ability with the play Pygmalion, and has since been successful in obtaining a number of roles mostly in French films and promotions. Belle has been featured in promotional videos for Tina Turner, and Iam. He has starred in \"Les gens du voyages\" and \"Un monde meilleur\", followed by \"L'Engrenages\" and \"Femme Fatale\", as well as \"Les rivières pourpres 2\", starring Jean Reno. After filming several more advertisements and promotions for the BBC, Nissan, Canon, and Nike, Belle was contacted by Luc Besson (director of \"Nikita\", and \"The Fifth Element\") regarding co-starring as lead actor with Cyril Raffaelli in the action movie \"District 13\", followed by the sequel \"\". Belle co-starred with Paul Walker in \"Brick Mansions\" (2014), a remake of \"District 13\".\n\nBelle largely stays out of the public spotlight. His last major appearance was when he appeared as a guest at the New Yorker Festival in 2007. Belle was interviewed for the parkour article \"No Obstacles\" written by Alec Wilkinson which was published in April 2007.\n\nBelle formerly endorsed the clothing company Take Flight, but decided to sever his ties to the brand because he disapproved of their business activities and motives.\n\n\n\n"}

It was located in the Herbert C. Hoover Building (owned by the General Services Administration), which is bounded by 14th Street NW on the east, 15th Street NW on the west, Pennsylvania Avenue NW on the north, and Constitution Avenue NW on the south.\n\nAlthough the National Aquarium in Washington, D.C. was smaller than its Baltimore counterpart, with the experience taking around 45 minutes, it was the nation's first free and public aquarium. It closed on September 30, 2013, after 140 years.\n\nThe National Aquarium was established in 1873 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts under the auspices of the Federal Fish Commission by Commissioner Spencer Baird. It displayed 180 species of fish, reptiles, and other aquatic animals. In 1878, General Orville E. Babcock, the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds in Washington, D.C. suggested a public aquarium in D.C. As a result, Spencer Baird's Fish Commission was given 20 acres of land. Because of this, the National Aquarium moved to the Washington Monument in 1878 and consisted of holding ponds known as \"Babcock Lakes.\" During the 1880s, the aquarium moved again into a building called Central Station near the site of today's National Air and Space Museum so that it could better serve its main purpose of being a hatching station for the Fish Commission.\n\nThe Fish Commission was incorporated into the Department of Commerce in 1903 and renamed the Bureau of Fisheries. When the Commerce Department building was completed in 1932, the National Aquarium moved to the lower level of the building after Secretary of Commerce and Labor George B. Cortelyou called for \"...a national aquarium of such size and architectural excellence that it will be a credit to the nation.\" The Bureau of Fisheries merged with the Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy (later the Bureau of Biological Survey) in 1940 to form the Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. The National Aquarium remained based in the Department of Commerce building, where it remained until 2013. It was the longest continuously operating aquarium in the United States.\n\nIn 2003, the National Aquarium Society Board of Directors signed an alliance agreement with the Board of Directors of the National Aquarium in Baltimore, enabling the two aquariums to work together to strengthen the animal collection and educational impact of the Aquarium.\n\nThe National Aquarium in Baltimore is a separate aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1981, it was originally distinct from the Washington aquarium. Both used the title \"National Aquarium\"; the National Aquarium in Washington, D.C., was older, while the National Aquarium in Baltimore is larger. Like its Washington counterpart, the National Aquarium in Baltimore is not managed or funded by the federal government, despite the official-sounding names. Neither is part of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nOn September 4, 2003, the National Aquarium Society and the Board of Governors for the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced an alliance, in which the National Aquarium in Baltimore would operate the D.C. aquarium. A signing ceremony hosted by Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans was held at the Commerce Department building.\n\nThe National Aquarium, Washington, D.C., had a collection of over 1,500 specimens and 250 species. Animals in exhibits included longsnout seahorse, leopard sharks, longnose gar, bonytail chub, Giant Pacific Octopus, chambered nautilus, tiger salamander, eastern hellbender, American alligator, loggerhead sea turtle, red lionfish, and snakehead, as well as \npiranha, eel, and Japanese carp.\n\nThe National Marine Sanctuaries and National Parks Gallery featured the animals and habitats preserved and protected by America's National Marine Sanctuaries Program. This gallery included exhibits for the Florida Everglades, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary, Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, and Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary. Featured animals included:\n\nThe gallery highlighted American rivers including the Rio Grande, the Potomac River, the Colorado River, and the Mississippi River. Featured animals included:\n\nThis gallery showcased salamanders, newts, frogs, and toads to display their adaptations and biology. Featured animals included:\n\nThe Amazon River and Amazon Basin support some of the most diverse life on the planet. Featured animals included:\n\nThe aquarium closed on September 30, 2013, having permanently lost its location due to a renovation of the Herbert C. Hoover Building. Approximately 1,700 fish and other specimens from its collection were moved to the National Aquarium in Baltimore.\n\nOfficials of the aquarium considered ways of re-opening it at another location in Washington, D.C., but they eventually abandoned such plans.\n\n"}
{"id": "1817992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817992", "title": "Union Freight Railroad", "text": "Union Freight Railroad\n\nThe Union Freight Railroad was a freight-only railroad connecting the railroads coming into the north and south sides of downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Almost its entire length was along Atlantic Avenue and Commercial Street. For most of its length, the Atlantic Avenue Elevated carried passengers above.\n\nWhen the line was built in 1872, each railroad had separate tracks and a separate terminal; the current union stations at North Station and South Station had not yet been built. At first, only four connections were provided.\n\nThe first connection was from the Old Colony Railroad, the line to Quincy and beyond. That line crossed the Fort Point Channel a bit west of the current bridge, ending with passenger and freight terminals southwest of the current location of South Station (fully south of Kneeland Street). The beginning of the Union Freight Railroad split off the Old Colony Railroad between the bridge and the terminals, heading northeast to Federal Street and then north on Federal Street, a street that ran from the Dorchester Avenue Bridge straight to Dewey Square (the front of South Station).\n\nContinuing north, about 1/3 of the way between Essex Street and Dewey Square, the line was met with a track from the New York and New England Railroad (now the Fairmount Line). This line came over the Fort Point Channel into South Boston (where the South Boston Bypass Road runs now) and back over the channel just south of where the Summer Street Bridge is now, with a passenger depot east of Dewey Square (roughly where the north end of South Station now lies). Freight facilities were in South Boston, where the South Boston Freight Terminal still operates; the Federal Street Freight Depot was later built on the downtown side. The Union Freight Railroad connection split south from the line to the passenger depot just after crossing Fort Point Channel, and ran west to merge with the main line on Federal Street.\n\nAt Dewey Square, the Union Freight Railroad continued north on Atlantic Avenue. Various track connections were provided to markets and docks on Boston Harbor. On the east side of the North End, the line merged onto Commercial Street, and turned west and continued along Causeway Street.\n\nHalfway between Beverly Street and Haverhill Street, the line curved off Causeway Street to head north between the passenger terminal of the Fitchburg Railroad and the northern freight house of the Boston and Maine Railroad, roughly between the current North Station and Central Artery. This track then split in two, with the east branch merging with the Fitchburg Railroad and the west branch merging with the Boston and Maine Railroad.\n\nNo connections were provided to the Boston and Albany Railroad (which ended near today's South Station), Boston and Providence Railroad (which ended in Park Square), or the Eastern Railroad and Boston and Lowell Railroad (which both ended near today's North Station). Additionally, the Boston and Albany Railroad and Eastern Railroad had lines to East Boston, across Boston Harbor from downtown.\n\nThe original North Station opened in 1894, lying just west of the old Boston and Maine Railroad northern freight house. The existing connections were kept. A new connection was built between the Union Freight Railroad and the Fitchburg Railroad, east of the old Fitchburg Railroad passenger terminal. Additionally, the track was extended west on Causeway Street to Lowell Street, where it turned north, merging with the original alignment of the Boston and Lowell Railroad and its bridge over the Charles River. This was later simplified, with only the original connection to the Boston and Maine Railroad and the new west connection remaining.\n\nSouth Station opened in 1899, with the Boston and Providence Railroad and New York and New England Railroad being realigned next to the Boston and Albany Railroad and Old Colony Railroad to access it. The old connection between the Union Freight Railroad and the New York and New England Railroad was removed. Federal Street was removed, as it was in the way of the new station, and the Union Freight Railroad was realigned onto Atlantic Avenue south of Dewey Square. At Kneeland Street, Atlantic Avenue made an S-curve to the west, and the Union Freight Railroad continued straight, along the east side of Atlantic Avenue, and merging with the combined Boston and Albany Railroad and Boston and Providence Railroad after passing under the Atlantic Avenue Viaduct (which crossed the Fort Point Channel between the Dorchester Avenue Bridge and the railroad bridge). No direct connection was provided to the Old Colony Railroad or the New York and New England Railroad.\n\nFrom opening until 1953, UFRR owned its own locomotives. From 1953 until closure in 1970, UFRR leased locomotives from the parent New Haven Railroad.\n\nIn addition, the prototype ALCO boxcab #8835 was tested in November 1924 but UFRR decided not to purchase the type.\n\nThe connection with the New Haven Railroad was severed on September 9, 1969. All remaining operations ceased on March 5, 1970.\n\n\n"}

In parts of the 19th century, and in the beginning of the 20th century, it was united with Torna County to form Abaúj-Torna (Slovak: \"Abov-Turňa)\" county. Its territory is now in eastern Slovakia and north-eastern Hungary. Today Abaúj and Abov are only informal designations of the corresponding territories in Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nAbaúj was situated some 20 km on both sides along the Hornád (Hungarian: \"Hernád\") river between (including) Košice and (excluding) Miskolc.\n\nAbaúj shared borders with the Comitatus Scepusiensis (Hungarian: \"Szepes\", German: \"Zips\", Slovak: Spiš), Comitatus Sarossiensis (Hungarian: \"Sáros\", Slovak: Šariš), Comitatus Zempliniensis (Hungarian: Zemplén, Slovak: \"Zemplín\"), Comitatus Borsodiensis (Hun: Borsod) and Comitatus Tornensis (Hungarian: \"Torna\", Slovak: Turňa).\n\nInitially, the capital of the county was Forró. From the late 16th century the capital was Gönc, and Cassovia (Hungarian: Kassa, Slovak: Košice) has been the center of the county since the late 14th century.\n\nAccording to Anonymus, during the reign of St. Stephen the Aba family (the family of Sámuel Aba who later became king) had properties in this area.\n\nThe county arose in the second half of the 13th century from the \"comitatus Novi Castri\" (named after \"Novum Castrum\", \"new castle\" – the castle itself stood in the center of the present-day village Abaújvár), which also included the later counties Šariš (Hungarian: \"Sáros\") and Heves.\n\nDuring the Mongol invasion of Hungary a large part of the county was destroyed, but the castle of Abaújvár wasn't occupied by the invaders. After the invasion King Béla IV repopulated the area with German settlers.\n\nDuring the reign of the last kings of the Árpád dynasty (late 13th century) Abaúj was de facto ruled by the Aba (family) (Slovak:Omodejovci). Certain parts of the county was taken away from them after the Battle of Rozgony (June 15, 1312) by King Charles Robert.\n\nIn a tax register from 1427 the county is mentioned as having 5187 peasant houses; 3500 in 1494-95. Before the battle of Mohács – marking the beginning of a 160-year-long Ottoman occupation of Hungary – the county had 9 castles, 14 towns, 318 villages and was owned by 275 landlords.\n\nIn the 16th-17th century many important historical events took place at least partly in Abaúj county, including the peasant revolt led by György Dózsa (1514), and battles between the Hungarians and the Ottomans. The southern part of the county fell under Ottoman rule, while the northern part remained part of the Kingdom of Hungary. \n\nOn 5 September 1619, the prince of Transylvania, Gabriel Bethlen captured Košice in Abauj with the assistance of the future George I Rákóczi in another anti-Habsburg insurrection. By the Peace of Nikolsburg in 1621, the Habsburgs restored the religious toleration agreement of 1606 and recognized Transylvanian rule over the seven Partium countries: Ugocsa, Bereg, Zemplen, Borsod, Szabolcs, Szatmar and Abauj. \nThe county again belonged to the Principality of Transylvania between 1644-48. \n\nBattles were also fought in the county in the early 18th century, during the revolutions led by Imre Thököly and Francis II Rákóczi. The Abaúj county was first merged with the neighbouring, smaller County of Torna (Slovak: Turňa) county in 1785, at the order of Joseph II, but they were separated again in 1790. After the 1848-49 revolution had been suppressed, Abaúj and Torna were merged again, but were separated in 1859. They were finally merged in 1882. Before the merging Abaúj had an area of 2872,71 km² and a population of 166,666; Torna had an area of 618,04 km² and a population of 23,176.\n\nIn 1919(?) Abaúj-Torna had 364 villages, of which only 5 had a population larger than 2000. Of the 63 counties of the Kingdom, it was the 45th largest by area, 37th largest by population and 35th by population density (65/km² in 1910).\n\nBetween 1899 and 1913 many of people left the Kingdom of Hungary and emigrated to other countries; from Abaúj 44,258 people emigrated, 13,566 migrated back to Hungary; in total it had 30,692 émigrés, making it the 8th largest emigration source of all counties.\n\nIn 1918 (confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon 1920), the northern half of the Abaúj-Torna county (1551 km², including Kassa/Košice) became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia and continued to exist as an administrative unit till October 26, 1922, under the name \"Abovskoturnianska župa\". The southern half became part of modern Hungary as the county Abaúj-Torna, with capital Szikszó. The Hungarian part was divided into four districts. \n\nDuring World War II Czechoslovakia was split and on November 2, 1938, most of the Czechoslovak part of the county (1257 km² with a population of 126,050, including Kassa with an area of 93 km² and a population of 58,090) became part of Hungary under the First Vienna Award, and was added to the county Abaúj-Torna, with the capital Kassa. On March 6, 1939, the Czechoslovak-Hungarian Border Committee annexed five more villages to Hungary at the request of the residents. After World War II, on January 20, 1945, the pre-war border was restored, with 52% of the original territory remaining in Hungary under the name of Abaúj county, with Szikszó as capital.\n\nDuring the administrative reform of 1950 in Hungary, Abaúj was merged with the remaining parts of neighbouring counties Borsod-Gömör and Zemplén to form the present Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Including Kassa (pop. 28,884), which, as a city with municipal rights, was \"de jure\" not part of the county\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> incl.

Entering service in 1919, the ship had a brief active life before being placed in the reserve fleet. Reactivated for World War II, the ship was transferred to the Royal Navy and then to the Royal Canadian Navy and renamed HMCS \"St. Croix\". Assigned as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic, \"St. Croix\" was torpedoed and sunk on 20 September 1943.\n\nThe \"Clemson\" class were the second class of \"liberty destroyers\" designed and built for the United States Navy. After the entry of the US into World War I, the United States Navy required lots of escort ships quickly. One of the classes given the moniker \"flush deck destroyers\", they were basically a repeat with increased fuel storage for greater range. They also had increased anti-submarine warfare armament in response to criticisms of the \"Wickes\" class. The destroyer measured long at the waterline and overall with a beam of and a draft of . The vessel had a standard displacement of and were at full load. \n\nThe destroyers was powered by steam provided by four White-Forster boilers to a pair of Westinghouse geared turbines. They drove two screws and was rated at . The vessel had a maximum speed in excess of . They had storage for of fuel oil, with a range of at .\n\nTheir improved armament reflected designs by British and German navies. The \"Clemson\" class was initially armed with four 4\"/50 caliber guns; one situated on the forecastle, two on the superstructure deck amidships and one on the quarterdeck. The quarterdeck gun was later moved to the aft deck superstructure to make room for depth charge roller tracks. The 4\"/50 guns had limited elevation and could not fire at aircraft. A 3\"/23 caliber gun was installed for anti-aircraft warfare defense, along with two .50 caliber machine guns. The mainmast was shortened to improve the field of fire for the 3-inch gun. Mk 6 and Mk 9 depth charges were equipped in US service and were deployed via the aforementioned roller tracks or \"K\" or \"Y\" guns. The destroyers also mounted twelve torpedo tubes in four triple mounts capable of firing torpedoes. The tube mounts were sited amidships between the superstructures. The destroyers carried no spare torpedoes.\n\nThe destroyer was laid down on 10 September 1918 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding at their yard in Quincy, Massachusetts with the yard number 332. Named for Roderick S. McCook, the ship was launched on 31 January 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Henry C. Dinger. \"McCook\" was commissioned on 30 April 1919, Lieutenant Commander G. B. Ashe in command.\n\nFollowing a period performing shakedown training, \"McCook\" was assigned to Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. She operated along the east coast of the United States until decommissioning at Philadelphia on 30 June 1922. \"McCook\" remained in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until recommissioned on 18 December 1939. The next year \"McCook\" was designated for exchange under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement with the United Kingdom.\n\nBy 1940, the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth nations were fighting the Axis powers alone after the fall of France. The convoy route between North America and the United Kingdom was under attack by German U-boats and required protection, but the British lacked adequate ships to defend the shipping lanes. That year, the US offered 50 \"flush deck destroyers\" to the UK in exchanged for leases to British bases around the world. In September, the deal was sealed and 50 vessels of the \"Clemson\" and \"Wickes\" classes were transferred to the UK. Renamed the Town class by the British, their new names were chosen from towns with names common to both nations.\n\nAfter entering British service, the destroyers were modified with British radar, asdic and depth charge throwers. Two of the torpedo tube mounts were removed to make space for an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, the aft 4-inch gun was replaced by a British 12-pounder gun and Type 273 radar was installed. Two boilers were removed and fuel storage was increased to improve range. The destroyer's final layout was three 20 mm Oerlikon cannon, one 3-inch gun, two .50 caliber machine guns, depth charge roller racks, one 21-inch torpedo tube mount sited on the deck centreline and the bridge area was revamped to make room for the new electronic equipment.\n\nSteaming to Halifax, Nova Scotia, \"McCook\" arrived on 20 September 1940. Decommissioned on 24 September by the United States Navy, the destroyer was transferred to the United Kingdom on the same date, but due to manpower shortages in the Royal Navy, she was retransferred immediately to the Royal Canadian Navy and commissioned as HMCS \"St. Croix\" (I81). Following the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers (but with deference to the U.S. origin), \"St. Croix\" was named after the St. Croix River forming the border between Maine and New Brunswick.\n\nThe destroyer sailed for the United Kingdom on 30 November via St. John's, Newfoundland but encountered a hurricane en route and was forced to return to Canada. HMCS \"St. Croix\" arrived at Halifax on 18 December and underwent repairs which kept the destroyer inactive until March 1941. On 14 March 1941 \"St. Croix\" assumed local escort and patrol duties in Canadian waters. At the end of August she joined the Newfoundland Escort Force and plied between St. John's and Reykjavík, Iceland. \"St. Croix\" underwent a six-month refit at Saint John, New Brunswick, returning to service in May 1942. By May 1942 the Newfoundland Escort Force had been renamed the Mid-Ocean Escort Force and its range extended to Londonderry Port.\n\n\"St. Croix\" sank the on 24 July 1942, which, with other U-boats, had attacked her convoy (ON 113) on 23 July, sinking two merchant vessels and damaging a third. On the return voyage, Convoy ON 127 was attacked by 13 U-boats. Between 10 September and 14 September eleven merchant ships and one destroyer were lost.\n\nEn route from Londonderry Port to Gibraltar on 4 March 1943 with convoy KMS 10, she assisted the corvette in the sinking of some off the Iberian coast.\n\nWith the addition of air escort to convoy defense in 1943, U-boat tolls in the North Atlantic diminished and many of the boats were withdrawn during the summer. In the fall, however, Germany began a new U-boat offensive. On 16 September, \"St. Croix\", then on her first patrol with an offensive striking group in the Bay of Biscay, went to the aid of convoy ONS 18, followed by ON 202, both heavily beset by a wolfpack. The defense of these convoys resulted in a long-running battle with losses to both sides. The convoys lost three escorts and six merchantmen, with two escorts damaged. The wolfpack lost three U-boats.\n\n\"St. Croix\" was the first escort to be sunk, taking three hits from \"U-305\" in the stern on 20 September. was sunk by as she came up to screen HMS \"Itchen\"'s rescue operations. \"Itchen\", forced to retire that evening, returned the next morning and picked up 81 survivors from \"St. Croix\" and one from \"Polyanthus\". The following day, 22 September, \"Itchen\" herself was torpedoed. Three men were rescued, two from \"Itchen\", one from \"St. Croix\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1818025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818025", "title": "Crack spread", "text": "Crack spread\n\nCrack spread is a term used on the oil industry and futures trading for the differential between the price of crude oil and petroleum products extracted from it. The spread approximates the profit margin that an oil refinery can expect to make by \"cracking\" the long-chain hydrocarbons of crude oil into useful shorter-chain petroleum products.\n\nIn the futures markets, the \"crack spread\" is a specific spread trade involving simultaneously buying and selling contracts in crude oil and one or more derivative products, typically gasoline and heating oil. Oil refineries may trade a crack spread to hedge the price risk of their operations, while speculators attempt to profit from changes in the oil/gasoline price differential.\n\nOne of the most important factors affecting the crack spread is the relative proportion of various petroleum products produced by a refinery. Refineries produce many products from crude oil, including gasoline, kerosene, diesel, heating oil, aviation fuel, bitumen and others. To some degree, the proportion of each product produced can be varied in order to suit the demands of the local market. Regional differences in the demand for each refined product depend upon the relative demand for fuel for heating, cooking or transportation purposes. Within a region, there can also be seasonal differences in demand for heating fuel versus transportation fuel.\n\nThe mix of refined products is also affected by the particular blend of crude oil feedstock processed by a refinery, and by the capabilities of the refinery. Heavier crude oils contain a higher proportion of heavy hydrocarbons composed of longer carbon chains. As a result, heavy crude oil is more difficult to refine into lighter products such as gasoline. A refinery using less sophisticated processes will be constrained in its ability to optimize its mix of refined products when processing heavy oil.\n\nFor integrated oil companies that control their entire supply chain from oil production to retail distribution of refined products, their business provides a natural economic hedge against adverse price movements. For independent oil refiners which purchase crude oil and sell refined products in the wholesale market, adverse price movements can present a significant economic risk. Given a target optimal product mix, an independent oil refiner can attempt to hedge itself against adverse price movements by buying oil futures and selling futures for its primary refined products according to the proportions of its optimal mix.\n\nFor simplicity, most refiners wishing to hedge their price exposures have used a crack ratio usually expressed as X:Y:Z where X represents a number of barrels of crude oil, Y represents a number of barrels of gasoline and Z represents a number of barrels of distillate fuel oil, subject to the constraint that X=Y+Z. This crack ratio is used for hedging purposes by buying X barrels of crude oil and selling Y barrels of gasoline and Z barrels of distillate in the futures market. The crack spread X:Y:Z reflects the spread obtained by trading oil, gasoline and distillate according to this ratio. Widely used crack spreads have included 3:2:1, 5:3:2 and 2:1:1. As the 3:2:1 crack spread is the most popular of these, widely quoted crack spread benchmarks are the \"Gulf Coast 3:2:1\" and the \"Chicago 3:2:1\".\n\nVarious financial intermediaries in the commodity markets have tailored their products to facilitate trading crack spreads. For example, NYMEX offers virtual crack spread futures contracts by treating a basket of underlying NYMEX futures contracts corresponding to a crack spread as a single transaction. Treating crack spread futures baskets as a single transaction has the advantage of reducing the margin requirements for a crack spread futures position. Other market participants dealing over the counter provide even more customized products.\n\nThe following discussion of crack spread contracts comes from the Energy Information Administration publication \"Derivatives and Risk Management in the Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Electricity Industries\":\nRefiners’ profits are tied directly to the spread, or difference, between the price of crude oil and the prices of refined products. Because refiners can reliably predict their costs other than crude oil, the spread is their major uncertainty. One way in which a refiner could ensure a given spread would be to buy crude oil futures and sell product futures. Another would be to buy crude oil call options and sell product call options. Both of those strategies are complex, however, and they require the hedger to tie up funds in margin accounts.\n\nTo ease this burden, NYMEX in 1994 launched the crack spread contract. NYMEX treats crack spread purchases or sales of multiple futures as a single trade for the purposes of establishing margin requirements. The crack spread contract helps refiners to lock-in a crude oil price and heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices simultaneously in order to establish a fixed refining margin. One type of crack spread contract bundles the purchase of three crude oil futures (30,000 barrels) with the sale a month later of two unleaded gasoline futures (20,000 barrels) and one heating oil future (10,000 barrels). The 3-2-1 ratio approximates the real-world ratio of refinery output—2 barrels of unleaded gasoline and 1 barrel of heating oil from 3 barrels of crude oil. Buyers and sellers concern themselves only with the margin requirements for the crack spread contract. They do not deal with individual margins for the underlying trades.\n\nAn average 3-2-1 ratio based on sweet crude is not appropriate for all refiners, however, and the OTC market provides contracts that better reflect the situation of individual refineries. Some refineries specialize in heavy crude oils, while others specialize in gasoline. One thing OTC traders can attempt is to aggregate individual refineries so that the trader’s portfolio is close to the exchange ratios. Traders can also devise swaps that are based on the differences between their clients’ situations and the exchange standards.\n"}

Daly and his gang were known for terrorizing townspeople with the violent treatment of those who resisted their thievery. A citizen posse would catch and hang Daly near Aurora, Nevada after a brutal murder.\n\nJohn Daly, by most accounts, was born in New York and wound up in California by way of Canada. He was said by the Esmerelda Star to be a handsome man. In late 1862, at somewhere around 23 years of age, with a string of dead men reportedly in his past (a rumored 4 to 10 in Sacramento, California alone), Daly rode into Aurora, Nevada to make his living off of the gold rush, one way or another. The Pond Mining Company hired him and associates John McDowell, alias Three Fingered Jack, Italian Jim, William Buckley, Jim Sears, and many others to protect its interests. The Pond was fighting with the Real Del Monte Mining Company over claims to Last Chance Hill. Both companies hired gunmen to intimidate the other side and to keep witnesses from testifying against their companies in court. Within three years some twenty-seven of citizens had to their death by the hand of violence.\n\nIn the fall of 1863, Daly and several of his men became deputy city marshals of Aurora. At this point one murder followed another. Honest merchants were shaken down by dishonest lawmen. In 1864 the Esmeralda Star is quoted with saying \"No sooner had the Marshal been sworn in than the worst villains that ever infested a civilized community were appointed policemen, and with but few exceptions they were composed of as hard a set if criminals ever went unhung.\"\n\nIn April, 1863, Daly Gang member Jim Sears had seen a horse tied in front of Mayberry's, near Hoy's Station, on the banks of the West Walker; mounted the animal and rode away. The owner, a German named Louis Wedertz, was much distressed by the loss of his horse, and followed down the road to Jack Wright's Station, now Wellington, and asked assistance of W. R. Johnson, who was keeping the place. Mr. Johnson directed John A. Rogers, one of his men, to mount and pursue the robber and bring the horse back. Away flew Rogers in hot pursuit, leaving a dense trail of dust behind him. The thief was overtaken at Sweetwater, and being called upon three times to stop, and refusing to comply, was shot dead. The horse was returned to the happy German, and both Johnson and Rogers were commended for their activity in recovering the stolen property, the fate of the robber being considered a deserved one.\n\nThe balance of the band determined to kill Johnson for the part he took in this affair, and laid their plans to accomplish this secretly. They sought to induce him to go to Adobe Meadows, where they owned a ranch, and keep a station there, intending to kill him, where there would be none to witness the act. They so far prevailed upon him that he was in Aurora on the first day of February, 1864, with the intention of going with them to view the place on the following day. Their intentions were discovered by one of Johnson's friends, who told him that if he went with them to Adobe Meadows he would certainly be killed, and advised him to tell the conspirators that he had received a letter from his wife that necessitated his return home in the morning, and that he would go with them some other time. Johnson did as he was advised, and retired to bed. The conspirators were satisfied that their victim had discovered their intentions, and determined to kill him that night. They went to the place where he was sleeping, aroused him, and coaxed him down to a saloon, where the balance of the night was spent. Between four and five o'clock in the morning Johnson started for his lodgings, and was met on Antelope Street by four men, and shot.\nSuch a senseless murder enraged the town. Dailey, James Masterson, and John McDowell were arrested by the authorities, and lodged in jail, while Sheriff Francis, with an eager posse, started in pursuit of William Buckley, who had fled. The prisoners were given a preliminary examination before Justice Moore, at the old police station, during which an altercation occurred between one of the Dailey crowd, named Vance, and a citizen by the name of Watkins, resulting in the shooting of Vance in the groin. Gang member and gunman Pliney Gardner was also captured, along with \"Irish Tom\" Carberry and others, but deemed to have played no part in the murder, and were banished from the territory. No witnesses could be found to testify against them or court officials to try their case for fear of retribution. Around 600 men met at Armory Hall and formed the \"Citizens Safety Committee\" in response. The vigilantes took matters into their own hands, marching to the jail and demanding custody of the prisoners.\n\nFor several days saloons had been required to close their doors at 9 o'clock in the evening, and on the ninth, the day set for the execution, business of all kinds was suspended. People for miles around came flocking into town, and on that day no less than 5,000 were gathered here, the majority of them being in sympathy with the proceedings. The town was very quiet, guards patrolled the streets, and everything was still and orderly, and when Governor Nye telegraphed to Samuel Youngs, one of the County Commissioners, that there must be no violence, that gentleman sent the following reply: \"All quiet and orderly. Four men will be hung in half an hour.\" At noon the vigilante companies formed in a hollow square about the scaffold, being under the command of Colonel Palmer, who received his orders from the executive committee in Armory Hall. The four doomed men were escorted to the scaffold, while guards upon the outside of the square kept the crowd at a distance. The execution could be witnessed to great advantage from a number of places in town, and at each one of these was assembled a crowd of eager spectators. Daly reportedly took a swig of whiskey while McDowell professed the innocence of Masterson and Buckley, but at half-past 1 o'clock a little cannon that stood beside the gallows was fired, the rope was cut, and the four men disappeared through the trap-door and were soon hanging lifeless, a terrible example of the vengeance of an outraged community.\n\nThis action so angered Governor James W. Nye that two days later he headed for Aurora with a Provost Marshal Van Bokkelen and United States Marshal Wasson and was going to call out the troops from Fort Churchill to put down the vigilantes. After the Marshal looked into the facts no action was taken against the \"Citizen Safety Committee\" and things were quiet at last.\n\nDaly had two houses and two or three lots in town at time of his hanging on February 9, 1864, including a cabin on the west side of Court St. south of Pine.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Allen Media Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Entertainment Studios. KEZI's studios are located on Chad Drive in Eugene, and its transmitter is located on East Prairie Mountain near Horton, Oregon.\n\nA group of Eugene investors, including former Chevrolet dealer Julio Silva and his daughter, Carolyn S. Chambers, formed Liberty Communications and were granted a license for Eugene's second television station in 1959. KEZI first went on the air at 6:30 p.m. on December 19, 1960. Its original studios and offices were located at 2225 Coburg Road, with the transmitter being sited in the Coburg Hills just to the northeast of the city. During its inaugural broadcast, KEZI said that it was Eugene's first full-power television station; with a power of 316 kW, KEZI reached 146,000 viewers.\n\nPrior to this, programming from all three major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) was shown on KVAL-TV (channel 13). When KEZI began broadcasting, it became Eugene's primary ABC affiliate while also taking on a secondary CBS affiliation. This was an unusual arrangement in a two-station market, particularly one as small as Eugene. ABC had long been the smallest and weakest of the three major networks, and its stature would not be comparable to that of CBS and NBC until about 1970. In most two-station markets at the time, ABC was relegated to secondary status. \n\nKEZI usually broadcast select CBS programming in off-hours, though Eugene viewers had been able to watch the full CBS lineup since the mid-1950s, when cable operators piped in Portland CBS affiliate KOIN-TV. However, channel 9 aired CBS' NFL regular-season games live from 1965 and through to the mid-1970s. \n\nIn October 1982, KMTR (channel 16) began broadcasting in Eugene, carrying the full NBC programming schedule. This resulted in KEZI choosing to become a full-time ABC affiliate and making KVAL the primary CBS affiliate.\n\nLiberty grew during its first 24 years, becoming one of the nation's largest cable-system operators. In 1983, Tele-Communications Inc. purchased Liberty's cable and television assets. Carolyn Chambers formed Chambers Communications and purchased several former Liberty entities, including KEZI. Chambers Communications then bought Medford ABC affiliate KDRV and KDKF, its satellite in Klamath Falls.\n\nOn February 14, 1998, KEZI moved from its Coburg Road location to the recently completed Chambers Media Center (CMC). The complex was home to most Chambers Communications projects. It housed five sound stages, making it one of the largest such facilities on the West Coast at the time. Chambers Productions' two films, \"Puerto Vallarta Squeeze\" and \"The Sisters\", were shot at the CMC and elsewhere in Eugene. KEZI has a fully digital master control and an advanced newsroom facility.\n\nIn September 2006, Chambers Communications established KOHD in Bend, Oregon. Broadcasting on channel 51, KOHD was an ABC affiliate and sister station to KEZI. As it never broadcast in analog, KOHD was the first primary digital station to carry a major network affiliation. KOHD was sold to the Zolo Media division of BendBroadband in 2013.\n\nChambers Communications announced on March 5, 2014 that it would leave broadcasting and sell its stations to Heartland Media, a company owned by former Gray Television executive Bob Prather. The sale was completed on July 15. Heartland had recently added CBS affiliate KHSL-TV in Chico, California to its holdings, making KEZI and KDRV sister stations.\n\nKEZI announced on December 10, 2010 that Chambers Communications could not reach an agreement to keep its stations on Dish Network's local feeds, leaving viewers in those areas in danger of losing local ABC programming. Their agreement expired on December 15, and the stations were removed from the local Dish Network lineup. Chambers and Dish reached an agreement to resume service, and the stations returned to Dish Network on December 30.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKEZI shut down its analog VHF channel 9 signal on February 17, 2009, the original date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to change from analog to digital broadcasts by federal mandate; the deadline was later pushed back to June 12. The station's digital signal moved from UHF channel 44 to VHF channel 9.\n\nKEZI's broadcast schedule is dominated by news, local features and ABC network programming. Sports is also a significant part of KEZI programming, with Oregon Ducks football and basketball and ABC's extensive sports coverage. In addition to ABC programming, KEZI airs the syndicated \"Judge Judy\" and \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\". The station has aired reruns of \"Star Trek\", \"\" and \"Taxi\". KEZI pioneered high-definition television (HDTV) programming in the Eugene market by airing a locally originated Oregon Ducks football game in late 2005, coordinating the broadcast with the Oregon Sports Network and ESPN Plus.\n\nThe station's news department serves most of southwestern Oregon. KEZI's sister stations, KDRV and KDKF, share news and video with the station. The news department also has bureaus in Corvallis, Roseburg and Coos Bay. KEZI relies on ABC NewsOne and CNN for national stories, and carries Portland-area stories from KATU and KGW. Weather is reported by chief meteorologist Marisa Woloszyn and meteorologists Andrew Shipotofsky and Andy Moffitt. Although KEZI was the longtime flagship of the Oregon Sports Network (the TV network for University of Oregon football, basketball and other sports), Chambers Communications terminated its relationship with the OSN in 2008.\n\nIn March 2010, newscasts began originating from a temporary set in the newsroom while a new set was constructed and other upgrades were made to prepare for HD. Chambers Communications' cancellation of long-form newscasts at KOHD, KEZI's sister station in Bend, facilitated the upgrade. On April 26 of that year, KEZI became the first Eugene station to broadcast local news in high definition; newscasts on KVAL, KMTR, and KLSR-TV remained in 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen until 2020.\n\nKEZI introduced a 24-hour local-news service, KEZI 9+ Nonstop News, on over-the-air digital channel 9.2 in January 2011. It broadcasts local news and a three-hour block of children's programming to comply with FCC requirements for educational programs. That autumn 9+ began airing the \"Friday Night Blitz Game of the Week\", local live telecasts of high-school football. This was followed by the \"Roundball Wrap Game of the Week\", local live telecasts of high-school basketball, during the winter of 2012. Both programs are similar to those broadcast by sister station KDRV NewsWatch 12+.\n\nOn September 9, 2013, KEZI 9.2 replaced KEZI 9+ with Live Well Network Western Oregon. Live Well Network is a home, health and lifestyle high-definition digital subchannel network owned by Disney-ABC Television Group and operated by the ABC Owned Television Stations. KEZI stopped carrying the subchannel on October 31, 2014.\n\nKEZI 9.2 began airing MeTV, which carries shows from the 1950s through the 1980s, the following day. MeTV Western Oregon is broadcast over the air on channel 9.2, on Charter channel 186, Comcast channel 309 and on Country Vision Cable 24. KEZI continues to carry the \"Friday Night Blitz\" and \"Roundball Wrap Game of the Week\" on channel 9.2.\n\nFormer evening-news anchor Rick Dancer (who spent 16 years at KEZI) and Al Peterson were highlighted in the Oregon Associated Press Best Feature category for Division II in 2005. KEZI received several Oregon Associated Press awards in 2010, including one for overall excellence. Lisa Verch Fletcher was the evening-news anchor until 2002. Ron Magers later spent over 45 years with stations in St. Paul and Chicago before his retirement on May 25, 2016.\n\nKEZI is rebroadcast on the following translators:\nLow-power translators for Black Butte Ranch, Myrtle Point, Newport, and Oakland have been discontinued.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1818042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818042", "title": "Tulsa Oilers", "text": "Tulsa Oilers\n\nThe Tulsa Oilers are a professional ice hockey team based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and play in the ECHL. The Oilers played their home games at the Tulsa Convention Center until 2008 when they moved into the new BOK Center. For many years, the Tulsa Oilers name was shared with Tulsa's former minor-league baseball team that pre-dated the Tulsa Drillers. To reduce confusion in local news reporting, the hockey team was often called the \"Ice Oilers\".\n\nFormerly a member of the Central Hockey League, the Oilers are one of only two teams which played every one of the CHL's 22 seasons (the other being the Wichita Thunder). The Oilers established a winning tradition, making the playoffs in 9 of their first 13 seasons. However, their performance in recent years has been less successful making the playoffs four times since 2005.\n\nOriginal owner Jeff Lund played an integral part in assembling the 1992–93 team, led by veteran minor league coach and former NHL ironman Garry Unger. The team, anchored by high-scoring forward Sylvain Naud and veteran goalie Tony Martino, finished the regular season in second place, right behind intrastate rival Oklahoma City Blazers. However, in the revived league's first championship series the Oilers handily defeated the Blazers, clinching the title on OKC's home ice. Lund assumed ownership of the franchise in February 1999 after being the team's general manager.\n\nOn June 23, 2013, Lund sold the team to the owners of the Wichita Thunder, the Steven brothers.\n\nTulsa has previously had several other hockey teams named the \"Oilers.\"\nThe original Oilers joined the five team American Hockey Association as an expansion team in 1928. Their first home game was January 1, 1929, against the Duluth Hornets, as part of the grand opening of the Tulsa Coliseum. The team won the AHA championship that season, and again in the 1930–31 season. For the 1932–33 season, the Oilers moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, and became the St. Paul Greyhounds, but halfway through the season they moved back to Tulsa once again becoming the Tulsa Oilers. At the end of the 1941–42 season, the AHA and the Oilers disbanded due to World War II. Hockey Hall of Fame members Duke Keats and Bill Cowley played for short periods on the Tulsa Oilers during this period.\n\nThe AHA was reorganized as the United States Hockey League for the 1945–46 season as a seven team league, once again including the Oilers. That league folded after the 1950–51 season. The team played at Avey's Coliseum during this time. Hockey Hall of Fame member Clint Smith played the 1947–48 season with the Tulsa Oilers after a stellar 11-year career in the NHL with the New York Rangers and Chicago Black Hawks and won the USHL Most Valuable Player Award.\n\nIn 1964, a new Tulsa Oilers team joined the Central Professional Hockey League (later shortened to Central Hockey League) in its second season of operation. The Oilers won the Adams Cup as the CPHL/CHL champions in 1968, 1976, and 1984.The Oilers played in the CHL until 1984 when the league folded.\n\nA new Central Hockey League was created in 1992 as a centrally owned league, owned by Ray Miron and Bill Levins. The league was operated by Ray and Monte Miron and funded by Chicago businessman and minor league sports entrepreneur Horn Chen. With the creation of the new CHL the Tulsa Oilers were a team once again. Ray Miron once coached the Oilers in the old CHL and his son Monte had played for the Oilers in 1973–74. Tulsa claimed the CHL championship in the CHL's inaugural season under general manager Jeff Lund and head coach Garry Unger.\n\nThe Oilers established a winning tradition, making the playoffs in nine of their first 13 seasons. However, with a decline in their performance and not qualifying for the playoffs since 2005 nor winning a playoff series since 1994, Lund hired former player Taylor Hall as the Oilers' general manager on May 3, 2008. After finishing third to last in the CHL with 18 wins in 64 games in the 2008–09 season, Hall hired head coach Bruce Ramsay, fresh off a trip to the IHL's Turner Cup finals with the Muskegon Fury, on May 21, 2009.\n\nIn Ramsay's first season as coach in 2009–10 season, the Oilers rebounded with 28 wins in 64 games to post the second highest point total increase in the CHL from the previous season. On September 2, 2010, the Oilers announced their first National Hockey League affiliation since their reformation in 1992 with the Colorado Avalanche, joining the Lake Erie Monsters of the AHL.\n\nOn October 7, 2014, soon before the 2014–15 Central Hockey League season was set to begin, it was announced that the league had ceased operations and the Oilers, along with the Allen Americans, Brampton Beast, Quad City Mallards, Missouri Mavericks, Rapid City Rush and Wichita Thunder, were all approved the expansion membership application into the ECHL for the 2014–15 season.\n\nOn July 31, 2015, the Oilers announced a one-year affiliation with the NHL's Winnipeg Jets and the AHL's Manitoba Moose. After the conclusion of the agreement with the Jets/Moose, the Oilers announced a one-year affiliation with the St. Louis Blues of the NHL, which did not have an AHL affiliate, for the 2017–18 season. The affiliation was extended for another season in 2018–19, but also added the San Antonio Rampage, the Blues' new AHL affiliate. As of the 2019–20 season, the Oilers and Blues are still affiliated.\n\nUpdated January 24, 2020.\n\n"}

The phrase is derived from a passage in Ephesians 1:10 (KJV), which reads: \"That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.\"\n\nThe term \"fulness of times\" was designated as a specific period by a variety of theologians and pastors in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Jonathan Edwards equated the term with the eternal state. Charles Taze Russell (1852–1916) considered the fulness of times to consist of the millennial age as well as the \"ages to come\". George Soltau, a dispensationalist, placed the \"dispensation of the fulness of times\" after the millennial age.\n\nJohn Nelson Darby held a formidable body of doctrine on the subject of the biblical significance of the dispensation of the fulness of times. Darby's literal translation of Ephesians 1:10 is: \"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself for the administration of the fulness of times, [namely] to head up all things in Christ, the things in heaven and the things on earth, in Him in whom also we have an inheritance,\" (from Darby Bible).\n\nAccording to some postmillennialists, the dispensation of the fulness of times is thought to take place \"prior\" to the Second Coming of Jesus. Likewise, in the Latter-day Saint movement, the dispensation of the fulness of times is often interpreted as the era after which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is said to have been restored to the earth by the religion's founder Joseph Smith on April 6, 1830 In this sense, the \"dispensation\" refers to the administration of truth and/or priesthood by the Church and its leaders, guided by revelation.\n\nThis being so, the term also appears in where it is used in the singular form [\"fulness of \"time\"\"] to describe Christ's first Coming at the meridian of time. In light of Daniel's \"time, times and a half\" (, , and ) these then seem to point to two different though indirectly related events, Christ's first Coming seen as one event leading to the concluding event encompassing all other 'times' when the King of kings is enthroned. The apostle John spoke of this \"last time\" () and warned of the expected anti-Christ (1 John 2:18) seen by the apostle as in the Book of Revelation. Here he sees these 'times' as chapters of a book whereby the time preceding the opening the fifth seal would be the time spoken of in Galatians.\n\n"}

He became son-in-law of King Edward III of England following his marriage to the king's daughter, Isabella of England, and the couple was subsequently granted by the king several English estates, among them the title Earl of Bedford. Coucy fought in the Battle of Nicopolis (1396) as part of a failed crusade against the Ottoman Empire, and was taken prisoner. Having contracted the bubonic plague, he died in captivity at Bursa, Ottoman Empire.\n\nCoucy had no surviving sons. Fierce legal disputes were fought over the succession of his lordship of Coucy, which, as a result, passed to the crown lands of France.\n\nCoucy became Lord of Coucy at the death of his father, Enguerrand VI, Lord of Coucy, during the sequence of battles ending with the Battle of Crécy in 1346. He also gained the titles of 4th Lord Gynes, Sire d' Oisy, in the district of Marle, and the Sire de La Fère. His mother, Catherine of Austria, oldest daughter of Leopold I, Duke of Austria, had died in 1349, during a wave of the Black Death. Coucy first became involved in the war against England at the age of fifteen, serving among the barons of Picardy in the battalion of Moreau de Fiennes. In 1358, at the age of eighteen, Coucy acted as a leader during the suppression of the peasant revolt known as the Jacquerie.\n\nYoung Coucy first met King Edward III of England in 1359, as one of forty royal and noble hostages exchanged for the future release of the captured King John II of France. He was retained as a hostage in 1360, when the Treaty of Bretigny established territorial adjustments between the two countries, and set the monetary payments for King John's release. The hostages finally arrived in England in November 1360. Coucy was to spend the next five years as a guest of the Royal Court. Chronicler Jean Froissart records that, \"\"...the young lord de Coucy shined in dancing and caroling whenever it was his turn. He was in great favor with both the French and English...\"\"\n\nIn 1365, the wealthy Coucy was betrothed and married to the 33-year-old Isabella of England, who has been described as an over-indulged, willful, and wildly extravagant princess. To care for her personal needs, her father settled a substantial annual income on her for life, as well as gifts of costly jewelry, and properties that included manors, castles, and priories. Coucy was her choice as a husband, as she wished to marry for love after the failure of previous betrothal negotiations with several noble houses of Europe. Coucy received, as part of the marriage settlement, the restoration of former Coucy lands in Yorkshire, Lancaster, Westmorland, and Cumberland, England. He was also released as a hostage for the French treaty requirements, with no payment of ransom. In November 1365, after their marriage on 27 July, the couple was given leave to travel to France. Their daughter, Marie de Coucy, was born in April 1366 at Coucy in Picardy, France. During a subsequent visit to England with his new family, Coucy was created as Earl of Bedford, and was inducted into the Order of the Garter. In 1367, Coucy's second daughter, Philippa de Coucy, was born in England. At this time, Coucy was presented with additional French lands, receiving the title Count of Soissons, which had come to King Edward III through the payment of ransom.\n\nCoucy and his English wife spent much of their lives on their northern French estate, although Isabella made frequent trips to England, particularly while Coucy was away in the service of France. He held the office of Governor of Brittany in 1380. He also held the offices of Grand Butler of France and Marshal of France. Considered among the most skilled and experienced of all the knights of France, Coucy twice refused the position of Constable of France, the kingdom's highest and most lucrative military office. \nAlways diplomatic, Coucy managed to maintain both his allegiance to the King of France and to his English father-in-law during the period of intermittent armed conflict between England and France known as the Hundred Years' War. At various times, he acted as a captain, envoy, councillor and mediator during the conflict. However, Coucy resigned all of his English honours on the accession of King Richard II on 26 August 1377.\n\nIn the autumn of 1375 Coucy engaged a number of Free Companies, including one led by Owain Lawgoch, to seize some Habsburg lands which he claimed through his mother. However, in the resulting Gugler War Coucy's troops were attacked when passing through Switzerland, and after a number of reverses the expedition had to be abandoned.\n\nIn 1380, after the death of Isabella of England, Coucy married Isabelle, daughter of John I, Duke of Lorraine and Sophie von Württemberg; they had one daughter, Isabel de Coucy (date of birth unknown; died 1411).\n\nThe 1390 Barbary Crusade saw Coucy as a participant. \n\nCoucy died at age 56, on 18 February 1397, at Bursa, Ottoman Empire after participating in the last medieval crusade against the Ottoman army of Bayezid I and his allies. The crusade climaxed with the calamitous Battle of Nicopolis on 28 September 1396, one of the most crushing military defeats in medieval European history. After a successful initial engagement against part of the Ottoman force, Coucy and other senior knights recommended a pause to regroup, but they were overruled by the impetuous younger knights, who wrongly believed they had just defeated the main force of Bayezid's army. Eager for glory, these knights then led their forces in a reckless pursuit of the fleeing Turks, only to run up against a fresh corps of Turkish \"sipahis\" that Bayezid had kept in reserve. A desperate battle ensued, but at the height of the fighting Bayezid's Serbian ally arrived with reinforcements, turning the tide in the Turks' favour. The Christian forces were utterly routed, thousands of Crusader soldiers were killed on the field, and nearly all the knights commanding the Crusader army, including Coucy, were either dead or captured. \n\nCoucy and many other leading nobles were taken prisoner, and the next day Bayezid forced the knights to watch the day-long mass beheading of hundreds (and possibly as many as 3000) Crusader soldiers who had been captured by the Turks. The prisoners were then stripped of most of their clothing and in most cases even their shoes, and force-marched 350km to Gallipoli. During the march, Coucy reportedly came close to death from exposure but was saved by another captive, who gave him his coat. From Gallipoli the prisoners were then transported to Turkey and held prisoner, awaiting the payment of ransoms. Although strenuous efforts were made in France over the next few months to arrange the release of the captives, Coucy died before his bounty could be paid, due to an outbreak of the bubonic plague among the Turks, although it is likely that he had already been greatly weakened by the wounds he suffered at Nicopolis, and the hardships of the subsequent forced march. His body was returned to Europe and he was buried at Abbey of Villeneuve, near Soissons, France.\n\nCoucy married as his first wife, Isabella of England, and had the following children by her:\n\nCoucy married at his second wife, Isabelle of Lorraine, daughter of John I, Duke of Lorraine and Sophie of Württemberg, and had one child by her:\n\nEnguerrand participated in the following campaigns:\n\nCoucy inherited the most awesome fortress in Europe at the death of his father, Enguerrand VI in 1346. The castle is known as the Château de Coucy and is considered a spectacular architectural achievement for its time. Coucy was responsible for the maintenance of the castle and additional construction on his familial estates, which consisted of the fortress, 150 towns and villages, famous forests and ponds, along with significant revenue. The estate was centered in the commune of Coucy Le Château Auffrique, in the modern Department of Aisne, France.\n\nCoucy found his estate in difficult economic and social circumstances when he returned from England in 1366. During his absence, facilities and agricultural properties in the estate communities had been damaged by both armies engaged in the war. Mills, granaries, breweries and other structures had to be rebuilt. Hired labor was in short supply, due both to the Black Death and war casualties. In addition, serfs permanently attached to the estate had fled to outlying communities, seeking work and security. In August 1368, Coucy issued a collective grant of freedom to 22 towns and villages under his control. He noted in the charter that his late father had intended to grant his subjects their freedom, but that the action was prevented by his premature death. Coucy established a system of rents and revenues intended to return the estate to prosperity and attract workers.\n\nAfter the death of Coucy, his former squire and first cousin Aubert, an illegitimate son of his father's brother, was legitimized by Charles VI. Aubert de Coucy, however, was not involved in a prolonged dispute over the Coucy estate between Coucy's eldest daughter, Marie de Bar, and his second wife, Isabelle of Lorraine (d. 1423). Upon Marie's sudden death in 1405, the vast Coucy lands became part of the royal estates of France.\n\nThe famous castle was renovated by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in the 19th century. However, in 1917 it was deliberately blown up with 28 tons of explosives at the order of German General Erich Ludendorff. This apparently was done for no other reason than to spite Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria who had asked Ludendorff to protect the castle from war damage.\n\nThe courtship of Coucy and his first wife comprises a large portion of the plot of \"The Lady Royal\", a novel by Molly Costain Haycraft. A fictionalized account of the life of Princess Isabella of England, it paints an extremely romantic portrait of the couple. Coucy and his first wife Isabella of England are supporting characters in the historical fiction novel \"The First Princess of Wales\", by Karen Harper. Coucy's life is the central theme to Barbara Tuchman's 1978 history \"A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th century\".\n\n"}

The system had developed by Galaxy Express Corporation, a joint venture between IHI Corporation (IHI), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), United Launch Alliance (ULA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LM) and several other Japanese companies.\n\nThe GX design uses a two-stage rocket. The first stage would have been the Atlas Common Core Booster, currently used as the first stage of the Atlas V rocket, which would have been provided by United Launch Alliance. The second stage was to be a newly designed stage produced by IHI, using liquefied natural gas as fuel and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer. The GX would have been the only space vehicle to use that combination of fuel and oxidizer.\n\nThe Japanese government finally abandoned the GX program in December 2009. Galaxy Express disbanded around March 2010.\n\nThe GX program began as an effort to upgrade Japan's J-I rocket, which launched only once. Thus, GX was originally known as J-II, albeit briefly. For a time, the program was termed J1-Upgrade, before finally settling on the current name in January 2003.\n\nJAXA reported that a full-scale second-stage engine had been successfully test-fired in October 2007. JAXA was developing this engine, the responsibility for which was planned to eventually be turned over to the Galaxy Express venture.\n\nIn late December 2007, The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that the GX program was being subjected to a thorough review, mainly because of unexpectedly high additional costs. It also erroneously claimed that ULA partner Lockheed Martin had discontinued production of the first stage engine, thereby requiring a redesign, likely costly, to move to another engine. \nThe paper said that the 15 billion yen that JAXA requested for the GX project was eventually slashed to 5.6 billion yen in the Fiscal 2008 budget.\n\nIt was originally designed to use an Atlas III first stage, and to be launched from Tanegashima in Japan, however this was abandoned in 2009 in favour of the CCB configuration.\n\nIn May 2008, it was reported that the Space Development Committee, who are overseeing the project, were considering its cancellation. In November 2009, the Japanese Government Administration Reform Committee recommended that funding for the second-stage engine be halted.\n\nIn December 2009, Japanese government decided to cancel the GX project. Development of the LNG propulsion system will continue for other projects.\n\nIn January 2010, IHI determined to disband Galaxy Express. The dissolution resulted in a one-off accounting loss of 11.3 billion yen.\n"}

Their music has been described as an amalgamation of cow punk, jangle pop, roots rock, hard-twang Americana, country rock, rockabilly, and swamp rock. The San Diego Reader summed up their sound as ...\"like Bo Diddley, CCR, Joe South, and the Yardbirds, ham fisted into a food processor, stuffed into a shotgun shell, and blasted into a beer keg at three in the morning.\"\n\nIn 1983, the Beat Farmers were formed by Country Dick Montana, former drummer for San Diego bands The Penetrators and The Crawdaddys, and Jerry Raney, singer and guitarist with The Shames and formerly of 1970s psychedelic band Glory. Singer-guitarist Bernard \"Buddy Blue\" Seigal and bassist Rolle Love from local rockabilly band The Rockin' Roulettes were recruited to round out the lineup. The band regularly played at the Spring Valley Inn and venues around San Diego State University. In 1984, they won the annual San Diego Battle of the Bands and gained a Southern California following.\n\nThe Beat Farmers were born out of an earlier band formed by Dan McLain called Country Dick & the Snuggle Bunnies. That band included many San Diego musicians who would later play important roles in both the Beat Farmers and the neo-traditional Country and cow punk scenes. Country Dick & the Snuggle Bunnies were: McLain (aka Country Dick Montana), drums and vocals; Richard Banke (aka Skid Roper), mandolin, washboard and vocals; Robin Jackson, guitar and vocals; Paul Kamanski, guitar and vocals; Joey Harris, guitar and vocals; and Nino Del Pesco, bass and vocals.\n\nHarris later replaced Buddy Blue in The Beat Farmers, Kamanski penned a number of Beat Farmer songs, Banke teamed up with Mojo Nixon, and Del Pesco later formed The Lonesome Strangers with bandmates Randy Weeks, Jeff Rymes, and Joe Nanini and Snake Farm with Barry McBride of The Plugz.\n\nIn 1984, they were signed to a one-off record deal with Rhino Records. The first album, \"Tales of the New West\", was produced by Blasters and Los Lobos saxophonist Steve Berlin and released in January 1985. The album included cover songs \"Reason to Believe\" by Bruce Springsteen, \"There She Goes Again\" by The Velvet Underground, and \"Never Going Back\" by John Stewart. It also featured their most well known song, \"Happy Boy\", which gained national exposure through the Doctor Demento radio show, and was played as a novelty song across the country, notably by disc jockeys Jim McInnes and Pat Martin on San Diego radio station KGB-FM, on Pittsburgh station WDVE, where it has been played weekly since the 1980s, and in the early 1980s on San Francisco, California, FM radio station KQAK aka The Quake FM 99, particularly on the morning show with DJ Alex Bennett (the Quake closed its doors on June 18, 1985).\n\nIn 1985, they traveled to England to record \"Glad 'N' Greasy\", a six-song EP for Demon Records. It was co-produced by Graham Parker and The Rumour keyboardist Bob Andrews and included a dancehall version of Neil Young's \"Powderfinger\" and Country Dick singing \"Beat Generation\" with backing vocals from Dave Alvin, Nick Lowe, Gene Taylor, Dan Stuart, and Loudon Wainwright III. Their month-long tour of England drew praise from critics, particularly from \"Melody Maker\", whose editor followed them around and subsequently compared them to The Beatles.\n\nIn 1986, the band continued to tour and signed a seven-record deal with Curb Records. Fed up by working with Curb Records, Buddy Blue left the band. Their major-label debut \"Van Go\" was produced by Craig Leon and featured performances by both Blue and new member Joey Harris, who previously played with John Stewart, The Speedsters, and Country Dick and the Snuggle Bunnies.\n\nThe next year, \"The Pursuit of Happiness\" was released on Curb Records/MCA. The single \"Make It Last\" was briefly played on dozens of Country-Western stations across the nation, but the rest of the album was too rock n' roll-oriented for the format, and the single was dropped from rotation. \"Hideaway\" was featured in the soundtrack to the film \"Major League\" and \"Big Big Man\" was featured in \"The Garbage Pail Kids Movie\". \"Poor and Famous\" was released in 1989, and included \"King of Sleaze\", a collaboration by Montana and Mojo Nixon. Later in the year, Montana and Harris formed a side project with Nixon and Alvin called the Pleasure Barons, a group that specialized in lounge music. The Beat Farmers finished the year with a three-night stand at San Diego's Bacchannal nightclub. The album \"Loud and Plowed and . . . LIVE!!\" was culled from those three nights and released the next year.\n\nIn 1991 Montana was treated for a thyroid condition and continued to visit a doctor for cancer treatments. The band appeared on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" on Friday, June 14, 1991, on NBC.\n\nOver the years, the band grew increasingly dissatisfied with its relationship with Curb Records, and repeatedly attempted to get out of their seven-album contract. Finally succeeding in 1993, the group began to record \"Viking Lullabys\" in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was released in August 1994 by Sector 2, an Austin, Texas, record label. In 1995, Curb/MCA released \"The Best of the Beat Farmers\" without the consent or involvement of the band. That same year, the Beat Farmers released \"Manifold\", their second record for Sector 2. Paul Kamanski, who wrote several songs on previous Beat Farmers releases, appeared on vocals and guitar.\n\nOn November 8, 1995, Country Dick Montana died of a heart attack while performing \"The Girl I Almost Married\", three songs into the set at the Longhorn Saloon in Whistler, British Columbia. The remaining Beat Farmers decided to dissolve the band three days later.\n\nIn 1996, Bar None Records of Hoboken, New Jersey, posthumously released \"The Devil Lied to Me\", the Country Dick Montana solo album. The performers included members of the Farmers, Katy Moffatt, Rosie Flores, Nixon, and Alvin.\n\nIn 2002, Rhino Records digitally remastered and reissued the first CD release of \"Glad n' Greasy\", now subtitled \"The Lost Beat Farmers Recording\", and an extended version of \"Tales of the New West\".\n\nThe remaining members formed several new bands including Raney-Blue (Jerry Raney and Buddy Blue), Powerthud (Jerry Raney and Joey Harris), The Joey Show (Joey Harris), Joey Harris and The Mentals, The Flying Putos (Jerry Raney, Buddy Blue, & Rolle Love), and The Farmers (Jerry Raney, Rolle Love and Buddy Blue).\n\nOn April 2, 2006, Buddy Blue died of a heart attack at his La Mesa home at the age of 48. Also that year, a live recording of an early show was released as \"The Beat Farmers Live at the Spring Valley Inn, 1983\" on Clarence Records.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, the band put on the third in an annual series of reunion shows at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, California. This show featured Raney (playing with his band, The Farmers), Harris (playing with his band, Joey Harris and the Mentals) and Love (who now plays with Billy Joe & the Roosters) on stage once again as the Beat Farmers. They also played with Dave Alvin, Steve Berlin, Mojo Nixon, and Paul Kamanski as a tribute to Country Dick Montana and Buddy Blue. The show is called \"The Dick Blue Ball - a Beat Farmers Celebration of the Life and Times of Country Dick and Buddy Blue\".\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed The Beat Farmers among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\nAll U.S. releases unless otherwise noted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Brandon, Manitoba, the son of a railroad engineer, and was raised in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. An avid science fiction reader from an early age, he studied English at the University of Saskatchewan (where he earned an Honours B.A. in 1957) and at the University of Toronto. He married fellow writer and U. of S. alumna Gail Robinson in 1958; they moved to Britain in 1959, where he worked as a freelance writer and editor for Aldus Books. In 1967–1968 he served as assistant editor of the controversial \"New Worlds\" science fiction magazine under Michael Moorcock.\n\nA lifetime leftist, he served from 1971 to 1984 as the Literary Editor of the socialist weekly \"Tribune\" (a position once held by George Orwell), where he regularly reviewed science fiction despite the continued refusal of the literary world to take it seriously. Before starting to write fiction in 1978, he wrote many books on history, science and folklore. Using the pseudonym \"Martin Hillman\", he also worked as an editor of several anthologies, among them \"Window on the Future\" (1966), \"The Shape of Sex to Come\" (1978), \"Out of Time\" (1984), and \"Hidden Turnings\" (1988). He is probably best known for his \"The Last Legionary\" quartet of novels, supposedly produced as the result of a challenge by a publisher to Hill's complaints about the lack of good science fiction for younger readers.\n\nHill and his wife had one child, a son. They were divorced in 1978. He lived in Wood Green, London, and died in London after being struck by a bus at a zebra crossing. His death occurred one day after he completed his last trilogy, the \"Demon Stalkers\".\n\nHis most well-known series for younger children appears to have been \"The Last Legionary\" quintet. Starting with \"Galactic Warlord \"the quartet (the fifth book was a prequel anthology) told the story of Keill Randor, last survivor of a murdered world, seeking revenge for the genocide, aided by a secretive group of advisers known as The Overseers and a winged, telepathic alien named Glr. The series contained the tropes of 'well-intentioned' Science perverted by ego and over-confidence into evil, and the 'good' science being used as the servant not master of humanity. The series also had the trope that elderly people are not irrelevant and worthless, but the smartest, wisest people around and the ones who really know what is going on.\n\nBoth \"The Huntsman\" and \"Colsec\" trilogies continued the tropes and themes of youth alienation caused by being disenfranchised, not lumping all aliens [foreigners] together, mismanagement of natural resources by the industrial military complex, and how disparate individuals can work together and find common ground for the greater good. Hill also explored these ideas in writing fantasy as well as science-fiction series, first in \"Poisoner\" and then \"Demon Stalkers\".\n\nHis books were popular in schools as their straightforward action and sci-fi or sword-and-sorcery themes appealed to impatient or inattentive readers, particularly boys, who were increasingly difficult to engage in 'reading for pleasure and leisure' and above all they were relatively short-length books without a great deal of background waffle. Whilst still at school and having become a volunteer 'pupil librarian', one writer and tutor was tasked with encouraging her teenage male peers to borrow more books from the school library and take up reading as a recreational activity and recommending books that would facilitate this from potential new stock; she found through peer reviews, questionnaires and a mini-poll that, 'alongside the contemporary, competitive sports-based stories of authors such as Michael Hardcastle and the humorous stories of such as Dick King-Smith, the other of the 'big three' for boys was Douglas Hill. They liked the fast pace, the paring away of extraneous words and the compact length of the books, as well as that although each novel was a complete story, it existed within a 'universe' that enabled them to not have to learn a whole set of new characters each time.'\n\nAnother advantage to sustain the increased reading interest of boys was that Hill produced his novels fairly quickly—he had five books published between 1980 and 1982, which meant the engaged interest of young readers was kept as there was another title ready when they finished a previous one.\n\nIn the early 1990s he decided to develop a fantasy trilogy for adult readers; published in 1994 \"The Lightless Dome \"has the main protagonist of Jared 'Red' Cordell, who finds himself transported from contemporary 1990s Earth to a planet where sorcery and Mediaeval style knights and kingdoms exist - he finds that he is apparently descended from or possibly the genetic Doppelganger of a legendary warrior, Red Corodel, who mysteriously disappeared centuries before and who is viewed as the only hope of thwarting a power-crazed sorcerer intent on achieving global tyranny through Apotheosis - becoming a god. Again the series examines the concept of an individual's ideals of personal integrity and community responsibility and at what point does altruism become destructive rather than constructive, and also the issues of spin and media manipulation as initially, he enjoys being in his own 'Conan the Barbarian' movie and plays on the perks of being mistaken for Red Corodel returned to save the day.\n\nA sequel \"The Leafless Forest\" was published in 1994; however, the last part to the trilogy \"The Limitless Bridge\" was not released and remains unavailable.\n\n\n\"Young Legionary\" is chronologically the first in the series.\n\n\n\"Prey\" is chronologically the first in the series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its traffic is figuratively described as \"Harlem's heartbeat\" by Langston Hughes in his poem \"Juke Box Love Song\". The IRT Lenox Avenue Line runs under the entire length of the street, serving the New York City Subway's .\n\nFrom 119th Street to 123rd Street, Lenox Avenue is part of the Mount Morris Park Historic District, designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1971.\n\nOriginally a part of Sixth Avenue, it was renamed in late 1887 for philanthropist James Lenox. In 1987, it was co-named Malcolm X Boulevard, in honor of the slain civil rights leader.\n\nThe avenue was the heart of Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1930s. The street brought together African Americans, Latinos, British West Indians, and Spaniards who developed relationships over common interests such as jazz and food. In 1932, Harlem was so firmly established as the world capital of jazz and African-American culture in general that \"black cinema\" films like \"Harlem Is Heaven\" were playing on the nation's big screens. Jazz flourished and grew like it could have in no other time and place. \"You might have had 15 great clubs on one block, all going at once,\" said the trombonist and bandleader Wycliffe Gordon. \"Imagine going into a joint to check out Willie 'The Lion' Smith, and sitting next to you are Duke Ellington and James P.

He is one of the seven founder saints of Brittany.\n\nVery little is known about Brioc's early life, as his 9th century \"Acta\" is not altogether reliable. It states that he came from Ceredigion where, indeed, he has a church at Llandyfriog. He received his education in Ireland and then studied under Germanus of Auxerre. He is believed to have spent time at Rothesay on the Isle of Bute in Scotland, where a church was dedicated to him and his name was commemorated in the annual St. Bruix Fair. He most likely returned to France early in 431, accompanied by Saint Illtud.\n\nIn 480, he settled in Armorica, and founded a monastery at Landebaeron. He then traveled to Upper Brittany where he established an oratory at St Brieuc-des-Vaux, between St. Malo and Land Triguier, where he eventually became the abbot of a monastery.\n\nAuthorities differ as to date of Saint Brioc's death, but it was probably in 502, or in the early years of the sixth century. He died in his own monastery at St. Brieuc-des-Vaux and was interred in his cathedral church, dedicated to Saint Stephen.\nRothesay, Bute\n\nHis \"Acta\" cites numerous miracles, especially his cure of Count Riguel, who gave the saint his own Palace of Champ-du-Rouvre as also the whole manorial estates. He is represented as treading on a dragon or presented with a column of fire as seen at his ordination.\n\nSaint Brioc's relics were moved to the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus of Angers in 865, and again, in a more solemn manner, on 31 July 1166. However, in 1210, a portion of the relics was restored to St. Brieuc Cathedral, where the saint's ring is also preserved. \n\nIn honour of Saint Brioc's link between Ceredigion and Brittany, the town of St Brieuc has been twinned with Aberystwyth since 1974 and a road, Boulevard St Brieuc, is located in the town. \n\nHis feast day is 1 May. The festival of Saint Brioc was celebrated on 1 May, but in 1804, the festival has been held on the second Sunday after Easter.

In North Hollywood it connects with the G Line (bus rapid transit) service for stations to the Warner Center in Woodland Hills and Chatsworth. It is operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\nThe B Line, which is one of six lines forming the Metro Rail rapid transit system, opened in stages between 1993 and 2000. Together with the D Line, these two heavy rail lines combine to form L.A. Metro Rail's busiest line. , the combined B and D lines averaged 133,413 boardings per weekday.\n\nIn 2020, the line was renamed from the Red Line to the B Line while retaining its red coloring.\n\nThe B Line is a line that begins at Union Station and travels southwest through Downtown Los Angeles, passing the Civic Center, Pershing Square (near the Historic Core) and the Financial District. At , travelers can connect to the Metro A Line and Metro E Line. From here, the train travels between 7th Street and Wilshire Boulevard (and briefly Ingraham Street) west through Pico-Union and Westlake, arriving at in the city's Koreatown district. Up to this point, the track is shared with the Metro D Line: at Wilshire/Vermont, the two lines diverge.\n\nFrom here, the B Line travels north along Vermont, and then west along Hollywood Boulevard, traveling through Koreatown and Hollywood. Finally, the line turns northwest and crosses into the San Fernando Valley, where it terminates in North Hollywood.\n\nThis route roughly follows a branch of the old Red Car system through the Cahuenga Pass, dismantled during The Great American Streetcar Scandal.\n\nTrains run between approximately 4:30 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. the following morning. On Friday and Saturday evenings, trains are extended until 2:00 a.m. of the following morning. First and last train times are as follows:\n\nTo/From North Hollywood\n\nTrains on the B Line operate every ten minutes during peak hours Monday through Friday. They operate every twelve minutes during the daytime weekdays and all day on the weekends after approximately 10 a.m. (with a 15-minute headway early Saturday and Sunday mornings). Night service is every 20 minutes.\n\nThe current B Line is the product of a long-term plan to connect Downtown Los Angeles to central and western portions of the city with a heavy rail subway system. Originally planned in the 1980s to travel west down Wilshire Boulevard to Fairfax Avenue and then north to the San Fernando Valley, a methane explosion at a Ross Dress for Less clothing store near Fairfax in 1985, just as construction got underway, led to a legal prohibition on tunneling in a large part of Mid-Wilshire, though this prohibition was later rescinded in the early 2000s allowing for the expansion of the D Line. Instead, after some political wrangling, a new route was chosen up Vermont Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe line opened in three \"minimum operating segments:\"\n\n\nThe route currently known as the B Line was originally intended to continue beyond its eastern terminus at to East Los Angeles. At the north end of the route, the B Line was to turn west from station toward Warner Center. Trouble during the B Line's construction, including a 1995 sinkhole that led to the project switching to a new contractor, led to a 1998 ballot proposition that banned revenue from existing sales taxes being used to dig subway tunnels in Los Angeles County, which put an end to expansion of the B Line for the then foreseeable future. The route to Warner Center was turned into the Orange Line, a bus rapid transitway (BRT) service.\n\nIn the early 21st century, new sales tax Measures R and M were approved by voters to specifically provide funds for subway development. While the B Line does not figure into currently active expansion plans, several concepts have been proposed that would build off of it.\n\nFormer Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has mentioned extending the B Line from its current North Hollywood Station terminus along Lankershim Boulevard to the northeastern San Fernando Valley, with a terminus in Sylmar.\n\nOne long-term possibility might be an underground extension of another mile or two to a future high-rise housing district, or to a multi-modal transportation hub station at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, a distance of approximately four miles. It would possibly go under Oxnard Street, the NoHo West development, Laurel Canyon Blvd, and Vanowen Street to the Burbank Airport. In 2006 a large number of housing units, including a high-rise tower was completed very near the North Hollywood (NoHo Arts District) station.\n\nPlanned high-rise housing developments further to the north, including the NoHo West development which broke ground in March 2017 and the possibility of establishing a direct connection to the planned California High-Speed Rail station at Burbank Airport have been suggested as additional justification for an extension of the line from its current terminus in North Hollywood.\n\nIn 2010, at the request of L.A. City Councilman Tom LaBonge, Metro staff studied the possibility of adding a station along the west bank of the Los Angeles River to 6th Street and Santa Fe Avenue. The study concluded that such an extension, completed at-grade along Metro-owned right-of-way, could be completed for as little as $90 million.\n\nThe study suggested an alternative station at the Division 20 Yard north of 4th Street and Santa Fe Avenue. This station would be closer to the residential population of the Arts District. As new turnback tracks will need to be built as part of the Purple Line Extension (to allow shorter headways), this Arts District extension could possibly be partially completed as part of the Purple Line Extension project, lowering the incremental cost of the station while increasing its usability.\n\nPlans of extending the B Line to the Eastside have been set aside with the opening of the Metro Gold Line East extension to the neighborhoods of Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles in 2009. Although there are no plans to do such, it is conceivable that plans for a future eastward extension could involve the San Gabriel Valley rather than the Eastside. Some citizen proposals have included the conversion of the El Monte Busway to heavy rail, although this would disrupt the existing bus and Metrolink service along that corridor. Other rights-of-way that could host a B Line extension, whether subway or at-grade, include the Union Pacific's Alhambra Trench, the former Pacific Electric two-track right of way extending through the City Terrace area to El Monte and Covina, and the median of Huntington Drive, which also held a two-track Pacific Electric line extending as far as Azusa & Glendora, until 1951, when it was removed.\n\nSee: Vermont Avenue Corridor Subway\n\nMetro is currently constructing the Purple Line Extension to extend the D Line (originally part of the B Line) seven miles to the Westside, with 9 new stations. This extension to the D Line will open in phases, completing in 2027.\n\nThe following table lists the stations of the B Line, from South to North :\n\nThe B Line operates out of the Division 20 Yard (Santa Fe Yard) located at 320 South Santa Fe Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles. This yard stores the fleet used on the Red and Purple Lines, and where heavy maintenance is performed. Cars reach this yard by continuing past Union Station, making a right turn and surfacing at the Eastern terminus of Ducommun Street. They then travel south to 1st Street, through a washing station, and enter the yard.\n\nThe B Line uses Breda A650 electric multiple unit cars built by Breda in Italy; these trains are based on similar vehicles that were built by the Budd Company for the Baltimore and Miami rapid transit systems between 1983 and 1986. Trains usually run in six-car consists during peak hours and four-car consists outside of peak hours. The acceleration for cars #530 and up is similar to that of cars used by the Washington Metro because they both use General Electric traction motors. The cars are maintained in a Metro yard on Santa Fe Avenue near 4th Street alongside the Los Angeles River in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nIn March 2017, Metro ordered new CRRC MA HR4000 railcars, some of which will operate on the B Line when they are delivered beginning in 2020.\n\nOn December 22, 2006, a rider accidentally spilled a vial of mercury on the platform at the Pershing Square station. He then located a passenger information intercom and told the operator that he spilled mercury before boarding a train. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was not notified until the next day, eight hours later. Metro has responded since the incident by giving hazardous materials (Hazmat) training to its field employees and operators so they can identify hazardous substances and take correct action in the future.\n\nOn August 19, 2011, an altercation between two passengers resulted in a fatal stabbing of one of the involved on the train near the Hollywood and Vine station. The suspect was caught on August 24.\n\nOn September 4, 2012, a 54-year-old man fell onto the tracks at the North Hollywood station and was hit by an oncoming train. He was rescued by firefighters and paramedics but died at the hospital.\n\nOn May 22, 2018, an unidentified man \"probably jumped\" onto the tracks at the 7th Street/Metro Center station and was hit by an oncoming train. He was rescued by firefighters and paramedics in grave condition and later died at the hospital. It is unknown if it was suicide or not.\n\nThe B Line has appeared in multiple TV shows and movies. Prior to 2020, it was known as the Red Line.\n\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by the Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group, which also operates local cable channel WJLA 24/7 News. WJLA-TV's studios are located on Wilson Boulevard in the Rosslyn section of Arlington, Virginia (at the former headquarters of the Gannett Company and its flagship newspaper \"USA Today\"); its transmitter is located in the Tenleytown neighborhood of northwest Washington.\n\nOn cable, the station is available on Comcast Xfinity channel 27 in Washington, D.C. (NBCSN is carried on cable channel 7) and channel 7 in the Maryland and Virginia suburbs, and on Cox Communications, RCN and Verizon FiOS channel 7.\n\nThe District of Columbia's third television station began broadcasting on October 3, 1947 as WTVW, owned by the \"Washington Star\", along with WMAL radio (630 AM, now WSBN, and 107.3 FM, now WLVW). It was the first high-band VHF television station (channels 7-13) in the United States. A few months later, the station changed its call letters to WMAL-TV after its radio sisters. WMAL radio had been an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network since 1933, and remained with the network after it was spun off by NBC and evolved into ABC. However, channel 7 started as a CBS station since ABC had not yet established its television network. When ABC launched on television in 1948, WMAL-TV became ABC's third primary affiliate; the station continued to carry some CBS programming until WOIC (channel 9, now WUSA) signed on in 1949. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.\n\nIn 1975, Houston businessman Joe Allbritton, the owner of the now-defunct Washington-based Riggs Bank, purchased a controlling interest in the \"Star\"s media properties, which by that time also included WLVA radio and WLVA-TV (now WSET-TV) in Lynchburg, Virginia; and WCIV in Charleston, South Carolina. As a condition of the purchase, Allbritton was given three years to break up the Washington newspaper/broadcast combination, which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was seeking to prohibit under the tightening of its concentration of media ownership policy. WMAL-TV was separated first from its radio sisters when ABC purchased WMAL-AM-FM in March 1977. Upon the radio transfer, channel 7, per FCC regulations at the time that forbade TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership groups from sharing the same call letters, changed theirs to the current WJLA-TV, after the owner's initials. In April 1977, Allbritton negotiated a deal to trade the station to Combined Communications Corporation in return for KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City, but called off the deal due to last-minute complications despite receiving FCC approval. Allbritton instead sold the \"Washington Star\" to Time Inc. in January 1978 (the paper would shut down in 1981), and retained WJLA-TV and the Lynchburg and Charleston television stations for what would eventually become Allbritton Communications. \n\nRumors abounded from the mid-1990s onward that ABC might buy WJLA-TV, effectively reuniting it with its former radio sisters. Indeed, in the summer of 1998, ABC's corporate parent The Walt Disney Company discussed a possible acquisition of Allbritton Communications, but a sale agreement failed to materialize. ABC eventually sold most of its radio properties, including WMAL and its FM sister station (by then WRQX), to Citadel Broadcasting Corporation in June 2007. Even so, WJLA remained an ABC affiliate under Allbritton's ownership because the company had an exclusive affiliation deal with the network. After WJZ-TV in Baltimore switched to CBS in 1995, WJLA-TV became ABC's longest-tenured television affiliate.\n\nIn August 2002, Allbritton merged News Channel 8 with WJLA-TV's news department, resulting in some staff layoffs. The unified entity moved into an office complex in the Rosslyn section of Arlington. News Channel 8 was originally based in Springfield, Virginia.\n\nAs of July 2008, WJLA-TV had an independent weather channel, Weather Now, under meteorologist Doug Hill. Until July 28, 2008, WJLA-TV offered Local Point TV on 7.2 featuring five-minute video segments created by area residents. Abby Fenton, the station's Director of Community Relations said in an interview with \"Broadcasting & Cable\" media industry magazine that \"the station likes the 'Local Point' programming and is pondering where else it might fit\". Retro Television Network (\"Retro TV\") replaced Local Point TV.\n\nIn late October 2008, WJLA-TV began simulcasting on local low-powered station WWTD-LP; the station continued to broadcast an analog feed of WJLA-TV after the digital transition. In late July 2009, WJLA-TV dropped its locally produced \"WeatherNow\" channel for The Local AccuWeather Channel on its second subchannel under the \"Doug Hill's WeatherNow\" brand. On March 13, 2012, WJLA-TV dropped the Local AccuWeather Channel in favor of forecasts from their own meteorologists. With that, the name of the channel was slightly changed to \"ABC7's WeatherNow\".\n\nWJLA-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 39 to VHF channel 7 for post-transition operations. While 90% of the station's viewers received WJLA-TV's signal via cable or satellite, many of the over-the-air viewers had problems after the final transition. Some needed to rescan, and others needed a VHF antenna. WJLA-TV applied on August 29, 2009 for special authorization by the FCC to increase its effective radiated power (ERP) to 52 kW. The power increase was put into effect on September 18, 2009. WJLA-TV already ran 30 kW of ERP, which was higher than the other three VHF stations in the area: WUSA (12.6 kW), WBAL-TV (5 kW), and WJZ-TV (28.8 kW) (post transition power levels).\n\nOn May 1, 2012, WJLA-TV announced it would add the Disney/ABC-owned Live Well Network to digital subchannel 7.3 on July 1, 2012, replacing RTV. WJLA-TV began carrying MeTV, a competing classic digital broadcast TV network on March 1, 2013 on WJLA-TV's second subchannel, replacing WeatherNow.\n\nOn May 1, 2013, reports surfaced that Allbritton was planning to sell its television stations so it could put more of its focus on running its political website Politico. Allbritton announced nearly three months later that it would sell all of its stations to Sinclair Broadcast Group for $985 million. After nearly a year of delays, the deal was approved by the FCC on July 24, 2014. The deal was finalized on August 1, 2014.\n\nThe station's second digital subchannel was an initial but secondary affiliate of the American Sports Network with its first broadcast on August 30, 2014. The station switched its subchannels over to Sinclair's owned digital networks, Charge! on .2, Comet on .3 and TBD on .4. WJLA-TV rebranded NewsChannel 8 as WJLA 24/7 News on Tuesday July 24th, aligning it further with the call letters of its broadcast station, WJLA-TV.\n\nSince 1970, WMAL-TV/WJLA-TV has used a variation of the \"Circle 7\" logo, which has long been primarily associated with ABC affiliates located on Channel 7. From 1970 to 2001, WMAL-TV/WJLA-TV used its own version of the logo, with the \"7\" modified to accommodate the circle. In 1984, it saw a minor update with rounded ends on the \"7\" being modified to use sharp, straight edges, like the logo later used by Australia's Seven Network. This version of the logo was probably the longest continuously used numeric logo in Washington's television history. The only real modification came in 1998, after it began calling itself \"ABC 7\" on-air and added the ABC logo to the left side. In 2001, WJLA-TV adopted the standard version of the \"Circle 7\" logo, refueling speculation that ABC would purchase the station, a deal that would never come to pass. WJLA-TV is the largest ABC affiliate to use the \"Circle 7\" that is not an ABC owned-and-operated station. In addition, sister station KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas, has used the standard \"Circle 7\" since the 1960s, longer than all WJLA-TV versions combined.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nThe station previously aired Washington Redskins games that were part of ABC Sports' \"Monday Night Football\" package from 1970 to 2005. This included Super Bowl XXII, a 42-10 Redskins victory over the Denver Broncos.\n\nBeginning in September 1984, WJLA-TV became the Washington-area affiliate for Atlantic Coast Conference football and men's basketball along a syndicated network that was operated by Jefferson-Pilot Communications and eventually jointly produced with Raycom Sports; WJLA-TV would carry ACC telecasts through the 1994 season. Channel 7 currently carries Maryland Terrapins football games selected for broadcast by ABC through ESPN's contract with the Big Ten Conference.\n\nIn the 2014 season, WJLA-TV began to air additional college football games through Sinclair's American Sports Network.\n\nIn 2015, D.C. United of Major League Soccer reached a new multi-year deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group to broadcast all 26 of the team's regional matches on WJLA-TV and NewsChannel 8 (now WJLA 24/7 News), succeeding CSN Mid-Atlantic.\n\nWJLA-TV airs any Washington Wizards games selected for broadcast by ABC through the network's contract with the NBA.\n\nWJLA-TV presently broadcasts a total of 34 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 35 minutes each weekday; and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station has the largest news team in the Washington area, which includes around 40 on-air staff members. As the flagship station of the Allbritton Communications station group, WJLA-TV provided all news reports for the Allbritton station group via its news-gathering service.\n\nPrior to 2001, WJLA-TV's newscasts had long placed third in the market's news ratings, behind WUSA and NBC-owned WRC-TV. The station hired Maureen Bunyan, former longtime anchor at WUSA, and in 2003, former CNN anchor Leon Harris joined the station as an anchor. In 2004, WJLA-TV hired Bunyan's former anchor desk partner, Gordon Peterson; and reunited the two as anchors for the 6:00 p.m. newscast. These personnel moves, combined with WUSA's recent ratings troubles, led to a resurgence in the ratings. In the May 2010 sweeps, it placed number one at 5:00 p.m. in total viewers, and in the 25–54 demo.\n\nWJLA-TV became the second television station in the Washington, D.C. market (behind WUSA) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition on December 8, 2008. The upgrade included the introduction of a new on-air graphics package as well as minor changes made to the news desk for better viewing quality with high definition. Field reports and promotions for WJLA-TV's newscasts continued to be broadcast in standard definition until the end of March 2013, when the station upgraded to HD field cameras for field shots and some news promotions.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, WJLA-TV laid off 26 staff members, including several on-air reporters, due to financial constraints. The laid off reporters included Andrea McCarren, Sarah C. Lee, Alisa Parenti, Emily Schmidt, Jennefer Donelan, and weekend sports anchor Greg Toland. Most of the dismissals took effect immediately, but some were allowed to serve out their contracts. WJLA-TV also announced a 4.9% salary cut for all remaining staff and a halt to company contributions to 401(k) retirement plans.\n\nPost-acquisition, concerns began to emerge surrounding how Sinclair's historic right-wing slant may affect WJLA-TV's news coverage. After Sinclair took over the station, WJLA-TV began to air conservative commentaries by Sinclair executive Mark E. Hyman, along with stories from Sinclair's Washington bureau—all of which were critical of the Obama administration. The station also partnered with the conservative \"Washington Times\" to feature its weekly \"Golden Hammer\" award—highlighting \"the most egregious examples of government waste, fraud and abuse\", as a segment during its newscasts. WJLA-TV staff members felt that it was inappropriate for a station in Washington, D.C. to air stories that are critical of the federal government; one employee told \"The Washington Post\" that with these changes, the station may \"lose the trust they built up with people over years and years. We've told people, 'We're just like you,' not, 'We're looking out for the tea party.'\"\n\n\n\n"}

This original project was to restore monochrome recordings of a Jon Pertwee story back to their original colour form, as the originals had been lost. The results of this were so successful that the BBC Archives co-funded the Team to restore three more complete stories. Since then, the Team has expanded and has contributed to many \"Doctor Who\" projects for both BBC Television and BBC Worldwide. These include many of the final \"Doctor Who\" VHS releases and all of the \"classic series\" DVD releases to date.\n\nDuring the original colour restorations, the team were keen to present the episodes as close to the original broadcast master tapes as possible, as explained by senior Restoration Team content producer Steve Roberts:\n\nOne thing which the team had to constantly be wary of was the temptation to not just restore, but to also improve on the original ... This would not be in the spirit of restoration, and the viewer would not be seeing a fair representation of the story as it originally was.\n\nIn 1997, whilst working on the VHS release of \"The War Machines\", the approach of straight restoration, that of returning the episodes to their original state, competed with the desire to improve upon what was originally broadcast. Sound engineer Mark Ayres explained the difficulties:\n\nThere are some difficult decisions as to how far I should take my work. Because the original video has been transferred to film, I've tried to remove anything which was added during the process of optical copying – in other words taking it back to its condition on original transmission.\n\"The War Machines\" featured a couple of instances of sound effects being faded in at the wrong points during the original studio recordings. Ayres:\n\nIt would be very easy to 'grab' a sound effect, and put it back where it's supposed to be. I haven't done it, because it was wrongly done at the time, and that's the way it should stay. All I've tried to do is correct technical defects which have occurred later with the film, I haven't corrected things which were done wrongly on the original tapes. Except in two places.\n\nAyres edited two instances of the original sound engineer on the serial fading the audio up and down quickly and creating uneven sound levels.\n\nSince work on the \"Doctor Who\" DVD releases began, the frequency of these edits and revisions has increased. The earliest releases had the colour graded to appear more consistent. Later releases have had their opening and closing credits remade to match the originals using modern software and electronic fonts, untidy transitional frames have often been removed resulting in a fractionally shorter running time, miscued sound effects are routinely adjusted and visual effects considered substandard are adjusted. The colour grading is often noticeably different from the broadcast originals.\n\nFor example, when recreating effects for the serial \"The Pirate Planet\", the Team explained that \"in the remade version, we took the liberty of allowing the wrench to be blasted back towards the camera at this point to help 'sell' the effect better.\"\n\nOne member, Mark Ayres, has done much of the audio restoration work for the final VHS releases, as well as many of the DVD releases, and all of the \"Missing Soundtrack\" CD releases since 1999. Other known team members, past and present, include:\n\n\n\n"}

It served football specials only, and had minimal facilities, as such it was not deemed worthy of 'station' status. It consisted of three platforms: platform 3 catering for return travel to Stourbridge, with platforms 1 and 2 being sited the other side of Halfords Lane.\n\nThe present station was opened in 1995, as part of the \"Jewellery Line\" project to restore services to Birmingham Snow Hill, this time it opened as a fully fledged station with regular services on the cross-city Snow Hill Lines.

He enrolled the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, ultimately dropping out, but managed to graduate from Empire State College in 1974.\n\nHe moved to New York to study acting. Over the next decade, he performed in a succession of plays, including the original Broadway productions of \"After the Rain\" and H\"'adrian the Seventh\", as well as the original off-Broadway productions of \"The Trojan Women\" and the controversial \"Oh! Calcutta!\".\n\nIn 1972, Rachins put his acting career on hold when he was accepted as a fellow in the writing and directing programs at the American Film Institute. He went on to sell scripts to a variety of shows, including \"Fall Guy\", \"Hill Street Blues\", \"Knight Rider\", \"Quincy\", and \"Hart To Hart\".\n\nDespite these successes as a writer and director, Rachins returned to his acting career with a leading role in Henry Jaglom’s independent film, \"Always\".

It was first released in May 1991 on the Factory label.\n\nThe album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number 2 in the United Kingdom and selling over a million copies worldwide. By the year 2000 \"Electronic\" had sold 240,000 copies in the USA.\n\nThe bulk of \"Electronic\" was written in 1990, with sessions beginning that January at Johnny Marr's home studio in Manchester. \"Gangster\" dated from an aborted solo album Bernard Sumner began work on in the mid-eighties, while \"Reality\" was written around 1988 when he and Marr first began working together. \"The Patience of a Saint\" also predated the album, having been written with Pet Shop Boys soon after their collaborating with singer Neil Tennant on \"Getting Away with It\" in 1989.\n\nSeveral other songs were also completed by August 1990 (namely \"Idiot Country\", \"Tighten Up\", \"Soviet\", \"Get the Message\" and \"Try All You Want\") as they were performed live at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles when Electronic supported Depeche Mode (although \"Try All You Want\" was played as an instrumental and several songs had working titles).\n\nThe LP subtly fused Marr's guitar playing with Sumner's synthesiser expertise, most prominently on \"Idiot Country\", \"Feel Every Beat\", \"Tighten Up\" and \"Get the Message\". Lyrically the subject matter was varied, from the aggressive targeting of rave culture by police in Britain (\"Idiot Country\" and \"Feel Every Beat\") to monogamy and emotional ambivalence (\"Reality\", \"Try All You Want\"). \"The Patience of a Saint\" featured a witty, sardonic duet between Bernard Sumner and Neil Tennant.\n\nThe album cover was designed by Johnson/Panas (Trevor Johnson) with two separate photographs superimposed with a computer screen effect. The hand-rendered lettering was based on typographer Wim Crouwel's Stedelijk Museum alphabet; the 1994 remaster used the design from a 1991 promotional poster with the typeface (Avenir) from the sleevenotes.\n\nUpon its release the album was unanimously praised in the mainstream music press. Writing in \"Melody Maker\", Paul Lester stated: \"Each song is crammed with elaborate details and merits a treatise. Very basically, we're talking Europop, my all-time favourite genre. The overall effect is one of swirling magnificence\". He concluded that \"Electronic\" was \"one of the greatest albums ever made\".\n\nIn the \"NME\" David Quantick wrote: \"This is a pretty 1990s sort of a record, fresh as a daisy and wearing huge new oxblood Doc Martens\", while Keith Cameron in \"Vox\" said: \"\"Electronic\" is simply a 100 per cent pure distillation of Marr and Sumner's respective talents. The hit single 'Get the Message' has it in a nutshell: it breaks no new ground; it simply achieves perfection\".\n\nThe album received the maximum five stars in \"Q\" from Phil Sutcliffe, who wrote: \"its strength is in conflict ... The inexorable pounding of the beatbox versus the fragile sadness of Sumner's voice and the he's/she's leaving stories; the symmetry of the synthesized or sampled sounds versus the sheer blood and bone physicality of Marr's guitar\".\n\n\"Electronic\" was also remarked upon in the United States. In \"Spin\" magazine, Ted Friedman regarded the album as \"impressive\", while \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"irresistibly tuneful\".\n\nAt the end of 1991, \"NME\" and \"Melody Maker\" ranked it 13 and 15 respectively in their top albums of the year.\n\n\"Get the Message\" was released in April 1991 as the lead single and performed well in both Britain (number 8 on the Top 40) and America (number 1 on Modern Rock Tracks). In July \"Tighten Up\" was released as a promo in the US and reached number 6 on the same chart. \"Feel Every Beat\" was the next international single in September and was a modest hit.\n\nThree songs from this era were released as B-sides: \"Free Will\" (on \"Get the Message\"), and \"Lean to the Inside\" and \"Second to None\" (on \"Feel Every Beat\"). A number of remixes were also released, by DNA, Winston Jones/Dave Shaw and Danny Rampling/Pete Lorimer.\n\nSumner and Marr gave a slew of interviews in the mainstream British music press, and appeared on \"Friday at the Dome\" and MTV's \"120 Minutes\" to support the album. \"Get the Message\" was also promoted by two mimed performances on \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nElectronic performed at the Cities in the Park festival in August, where Pet Shop Boys guested on \"Getting Away with It\", and played three dates in Paris, Glasgow and London in December 1991. (A tour of North America in October/November with dance acts as support was cancelled.) Pet Shop Boys joined Sumner and Marr for three numbers in the last concert, namely \"Getting Away with It\", \"The Patience of a Saint\" and the then-unreleased song \"Disappointed\".\n\nThe standard edition of Electronic was released initially in 1991 internationally (With the noticeable absence of \"Getting Away With It\" in the original UK release), and was remastered many times in different regions, such as in Europe in 1992, with the non-album single \"Disappointed\" being added alongside as a bonus CD, and was also re-released in the UK in 1994 (This particular version being remastered by the album's engineer Owen Morris), and with the album also being re-released in Japan in 1995.\n\nIn 2007, Electronic, was released as a download-only on the iTunes Store, with the first half of the release containing the original 11 songs from the 1994 remastered UK release, and the other half featuring b-sides of songs from Electronic and remixes of Electronic songs by third parties. \n\nThe 2013 special edition re-release of the album contains 2 CDs, the 1st CD containing the standard 11 songs found in Electronic songs, while the 2nd CD contains 11 edits and mixes of various songs, mostly from the Electronic recording sessions, although some of which were even recording outside the time-frame in which Electronic was recorded, such as Until the End of Time, Visit Me and the B-side of Second Nature, called Turning Point, which originated from the Raise the Pressure recording sessions, while Twisted Tenderness is the title-track of the album of the same name, which was released 8 years after the release of Electronic.\n\nAll songs on Electronic were written and performed by Sumner and Marr, with the notable exceptions of \"The Patience of a Saint\", which was composed by Electronic with Pet Shop Boys and credited to Sumner, Marr, Tennant and Chris Lowe. The bonus track \"Getting Away with It\" was written by Sumner, Marr and Tennant. The album was produced by Sumner and Marr, and engineered by Owen Morris.\n\nIn an interview with \"Sound on Sound\" in October 1991, Bernard Sumner revealed the following technology was used during the making of the album. He stated that the album \"took 200 days from beginning to end\" in the same interview.\n\n\n\nTrack titles from the album were used as onscreen text during transformation sequences in the 1997 tokusatsu series \"Denji Sentai Megaranger\". The footage was reused the following year in \"Power Rangers in Space\". \n\n"}

The constituency was created in 1295 and is centred on the university city of Cambridge.\n\nIt was held by the Conservatives from 1967 to 1992, since when it has been represented alternately by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union, the constituency voted 73.8% to remain.\n\nCambridge returned two Members to Parliament from 1295 until 1885, using the bloc vote system. These were generally townsmen who were involved in local government, with at least sixty mayors of Cambridge having served as MP by 1621. Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 representation was reduced to one member with effect from the 1885 general election.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1992, Cambridge was Conservative-won, save for 1945-1950 and 1966-1968 when it was Labour-won.\n\nHistorically the city of Cambridge retained some electors and was often the source of MPs to a second constituency, for Cambridge University, covering all successful alumni in its electorate. The university seat was created in 1603 as part of the scheme of University constituencies. Its MPs included Isaac Newton, William Pitt the Younger, Lord Palmerston, George Stokes, Richard Jebb, and Archibald Hill before abolition in 1950.\n\nIn 1992 Cambridge was won by Labour's Anne Campbell, who held onto the seat for 13 years (three Parliamentary terms). In 2005 it was taken by David Howarth of the Liberal Democrats, the first time the party including its two forerunner parties had taken the seat since the 1906 Liberal-progressive landslide; his successor, Julian Huppert, held the seat with an increased majority in the 2010 general election.

However, for the cases of helium-4 and its isotope helium-3, there is a pressure range where they can remain liquid down to absolute zero because the amplitude of the quantum fluctuations experienced by the helium atoms is larger than the inter-atomic distances.\n\nIn the case of solid quantum fluids, it is only a fraction of its electrons or protons that behave like a “fluid”. One prominent example is that of superconductivity where quasi-particles made up of pairs of electrons and a phonon act as bosons which are then capable of collapsing into the ground state to establish a supercurrent with a resistivity near zero.\n\nQuantum mechanical effects become significant for physics in the range of the de Broglie wavelength. For condensed matter, this is when the de Broglie wavelength of a particle is greater than the spacing between the particles in the lattice that comprises the matter.\nThe de Broglie wavelength associated with a massive particle is\nwhere h is the Planck constant. The momentum can be found from the kinetic theory of gases, where\nHere, the temperature can be found as\nOf course, we can replace the momentum here with the momentum derived from the de Broglie wavelength like so:\nHence, we can say that quantum fluids will manifest at approximate temperature regions where formula_5, where d is the lattice spacing (or inter-particle spacing). Mathematically, this is stated like so:\nIt is easy to see how the above definition relates to the particle density, n. We can write\nas formula_8 for a three dimensional lattice.\n\nFor quantum fluids, the probability of particles within a lattice exchanging places with their neighbours becomes significant; in theory, this is dependent on potential barriers within the system. In the case of quantum fluids, the magnitude of these potential barriers must not be too large with respect to formula_9.\n\nThe above temperature limit formula_10 has different meaning depending on the quantum statistics followed by each system, but generally refers to the point at which the system manifests quantum fluid properties. For a system of fermions, formula_10 is an estimation of the Fermi energy of the system, where processes important to phenomena such as superconductivity take place. For bosons, formula_10 gives an estimation of the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature.\n\n"}

Named after the physicist and mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton, a Hamiltonian vector field is a geometric manifestation of Hamilton's equations in classical mechanics. The integral curves of a Hamiltonian vector field represent solutions to the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian form. The diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold arising from the flow of a Hamiltonian vector field are known as canonical transformations in physics and (Hamiltonian) symplectomorphisms in mathematics.\n\nHamiltonian vector fields can be defined more generally on an arbitrary Poisson manifold. The Lie bracket of two Hamiltonian vector fields corresponding to functions \"f\" and \"g\" on the manifold is itself a Hamiltonian vector field, with the Hamiltonian given by the \nPoisson bracket of \"f\" and \"g\".\n\nSuppose that is a symplectic manifold.

It is the result of a monomer which has been polymerized into a long chain.\n\nThere may be more than one structural unit in the repeat unit. When different monomers are polymerized, a copolymer is formed. It is a routine way of developing new properties for new materials.\n\nConsider the example of polyethylene terephthalate (PET or \"polyester\"). The monomers which could be used to create this polymer are ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid:\n\nHO-CH-CH-OH\nand\nHOOC-CH-COOH\n\nIn the polymer, there are two structural units, which are\n-O-CH-CH-O-\nand\n-CO-CH-CO-\n\nThe repeat unit is\n\n-CH-CH-O-CO-CH-CO-O-\n\nThe functionality of a monomeric structural unit is defined as the number of covalent bonds which it forms with other reactants. A structural unit in a linear polymer chain segment forms two bonds and is therefore bifunctional, as for the PET structural units above.\n\nOther values of functionality exist. Unless the macromolecule is cyclic, it will have monovalent structural units at each end of the polymer chain. In branched polymers, there are trifunctional units at each branch point. For example, in the synthesis of PET, a small fraction of the ethylene glycol can be replaced by glycerol which has three alcohol groups. This trifunctional molecule inserts itself in the polymeric chain and bonds to three carboxylic acid groups forming a branch point.\n\nFinally, the formation of cross-linked polymers involves tetrafunctional structural units. For example, in the synthesis of cross-linked polystyrene, a small fraction of monomeric styrene (or vinylbenzene) is remplaced by 1,4-divinylbenzene (or \"para\"-divinylbenzene). Each of the two vinyl groups is inserted into a polymeric chain, so that the tetravalent unit is inserted into both chains, linking them together.\n\n\n"}

Durham was a longtime minor league hitting coach, and most recently served as the assistant hitting coach for the Detroit Tigers during the 2017 season. Durham played with the St. Louis Cardinals (1980, 1989), Chicago Cubs (1981–1988), and Cincinnati Reds (1988). Durham batted and threw left-handed.\n\nDurham graduated from Cincinnati Woodward High School in 1976 where he was a high school All-American selection his senior year, posting a .385 batting average with 16 home runs and an 11-3 record as a pitcher.\n\nDurham was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1976 amateur draft in the first round and 15th overall.\n\nDurham made his major league debut on May 27, 1980 with the St. Louis Cardinals. He was traded that off-season to the Cubs for Bruce Sutter, and his career took off. He hit 10 home runs and drove in 55 runs in a strike-shortened 1981 season, then followed that with a stellar 1982 season in which he had a .312 batting average with 22 homers, 90 RBI, and 28 stolen bases. He won the Silver Slugger Award as the Cubs' left fielder and made the All-Star team. He followed that with a hot first half in 1983 of 12 homers and 55 RBI and another All-Star Game appearance, but was injured shortly after the break and missed the rest of the season.\n\nIn 1984, the Cubs made several team-improving deals. They acquired Bob Dernier and Gary Matthews from the Phillies, moved Keith Moreland to right field, and Durham to first base. Durham essentially supplanted Bill Buckner, who was then dealt to the Red Sox for Dennis Eckersley. Durham responded with another stellar year by hitting .279 with 23 homers and 96 RBIs as the Cubs won the National League East. For good measure, Durham homered in both Games 4 and 5 of the 1984 NLCS. Durham would follow that season with three more consecutive 20-homer seasons, including a career-high 27 in 1987. However, his RBI totals decreased from 96 in 1984 to 75, 65, and 63, respectively.\n\nIn 1988, Durham got off to a miserable start, hitting only .218 with 3 homers after 21 games. Mark Grace began to see more time at first, and the Cubs traded Durham to the Cincinnati Reds for Pat Perry amid rumors of drug use. Durham played in only 21 games for the Reds that season before entering into drug and alcohol rehabilitation. He tried a comeback with the Cardinals the next season, but only went 1 for 18 before retiring.\n\nIn a 10-year Major League career, Durham compiled a lifetime batting average of .277, hitting 147 home runs and driving in 530 runs. He recorded an overall .991 fielding percentage playing primarily at first base and all three outfield positions.\n\nLeon Durham is widely remembered for an error that he made at first base during the 1984 National League Championship Series. In the bottom of the seventh inning in the decisive fifth game between Durham's Chicago Cubs and the San Diego Padres, the Padres sent pinch-hitter Tim Flannery to face the Cubs' ace pitcher Rick Sutcliffe.\n\nThrough the top of the sixth inning, the Cubs had a 3-0 lead. In the bottom of the sixth inning, the Padres cut the Cubs' lead to 3-2 with a pair of singles by Alan Wiggins and Tony Gwynn, a walk to Steve Garvey, and sacrifice flies by Graig Nettles and Terry Kennedy. The bottom of the seventh inning kicked off with Carmelo Martínez walking on four pitches from Sutcliffe. Garry Templeton then sacrificed Martínez to second, setting things up for Tim Flannery. Martinez would then score when Flannery hit a sharp grounder that trickled through Leon Durham's legs for an error.\n\nThe error became known as the \"Gatorade Glove Play\" because before taking his position in the field that inning, Gatorade was spilled on Durham's glove. Some Cub fans believe the Gatorade spilled on Durham's glove amounted to a curse, similar to the goat and Bartman curses of Cub lore.\n\nThe play would also turn out to be very similar, in style and effect, to Bill Buckner's much-discussed error in the 1986 World Series. The coincidental connection between these two events is that Durham had been moved from the outfield to first base during the 1984 season, replacing Buckner after the Cubs traded him to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher Dennis Eckersley. Buckner's error, like Durham's, would be seen as turning a post-season series around. The same joke even circulated for both incidents: That they had been despondent, jumped in front of a moving truck, and \"the truck went between their legs\".\n\nThe Padres wound up winning the game 6-3 to reach the World Series for the first time ever. The Cubs had won the first 2 games of the series (1984 marked the last time that the League Championship Series was a best-of-five series) over the Padres.\n\nIn 1993, Durham played for the then Northern League's Saint Paul Saints.\n\nDurham previously served as the hitting coach for the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A affiliate the Toledo Mud Hens. On October 21, 2016, he was named the assistant hitting coach of the Detroit Tigers, after 17 seasons as a coach with the Mud Hens.Durham is presently in his second year as the hitting coach for the Louisville Bats the Triple-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n"}

Adweek called it one of the \"most iconic alcohol campaigns in advertising history.\" The first Budweiser Frogs commercial was created by David Swaine, Michael Smith and Mark Choate of DMB&B/St. Louis. The commercial was directed by Gore Verbinski, who would later direct the first three \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films.\n\nThe commercial began with a scene of a swamp at nighttime, and a close-up of Bud rhythmically croaking his name. Later Weis and Er join in. They croak rather randomly for about ten seconds, until Bud, Weis, and Er begin croaking in sequence, thus forming the Budweiser name. Their croaking becomes quicker as the camera pulls back to show a bar with a large neon Budweiser sign glowing in the night. The commercial is often listed among the best Super Bowl commercials in history, ranking at No. 5 at MSNBC's list in 2004. Several more Frog ads were produced, with Hollywood Animatronic Effects company The Character Shop brought online to give the frogs more flexibility and capabilities. In one ad, the three Bud Frogs are sitting on a log in a Louisiana swamp, chanting their \"Bud...Weis...Er\" chorus, when a Budweiser truck rolls by. The \"Bud\" frog zaps out his sticky tongue, latching onto the moving truck. Like an elastic bungee, the tongue stretches to the point where it can no more, then launches the frog off the log, sending him flying through the air after the truck, while a \"Yee-Haw!\" and Cajun music is heard. The frog puppets featured silicone skins over animatronic armatures, which allowed the frogs to breathe, bloat their throats, speak, and blink and move their eyes, via Radio Control and Rod Operation. A subsequent ad featured not the entire trio, but rather Bud and a newfound female frog. One later Super Bowl commercial featuring the frogs had them riding on the back of an alligator into the bar, where they croak their names at the startled patrons, and leave with a crate of Budweiser beer strapped to the alligator's waist while dancing to Jamming by Bob Marley and the Wailers.\n\nAfter the initial ads generated great interest, new creatures began making appearances in the swamp. Beginning at Super Bowl XXXII, a new campaign created by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners introduced two wisecracking chameleons made their debut. Louie, notable for his distinct Brooklyn accent (he was voiced by New York City voice actor Paul Christie), was irritated by the frogs' incessant croaking, and jealous of their success, while Frankie, who speaks in a low baritone voice (voiced by the Broadway veteran Danny Mastrogiorgio), was his more rational, even-tempered friend. Frankie apparently socialized with the frogs and was puzzled by Louie's animosity towards them.\n\nAs the series' storyline progressed, it documented Louie's enlisting the assistance of an inept ferret hit man, who tries to kill the frogs by dismantling and dropping the Budweiser neon sign into the swamp water, thus electrocuting them. Although this assassination attempt failed, it resulted in Weis developing post-electroshock muscular irregularity. Louie briefly replaced Weis in the Bud-Weis-Er cheer, but ended up getting all of them fired, due to Louie's inability to just follow the script. The other frogs in return gave him a literal and revealed to Louie that they could speak with a complete vocabulary and that they knew all along about his plot against them. These three frogs then began a new lifestyle as flashy tap-dancing and Fred Astaire-mimicking acts on Broadway.\n\nThe Budweiser Lizards later displaced the frogs entirely and continued appearing in television and radio advertisements into the early 2000s. In March 1999 Budweiser released a CD, \"Frank & Louie's Greatest Hits\", featuring songs such as \"Sweet Home Alabama, \"My Sharona\", and \"Rock This Town\" woven around alternate takes of some of Frank and Louie's radio ads.\n\nMuch like the Joe Camel controversy around the time of the frogs popularity, a 1996 study showed that children often recognized the Budweiser frogs as much as other ad icons like Ronald McDonald and Tony the Tiger, as well as other cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny. Many have speculated that Budweiser's frogs were targeting younger people to their alcoholic products. Anheuser-Busch denies this, but because of such findings Budweiser eventually slowed down the ad campaign in the years ahead, and by 1998 the frogs were discontinued and replaced by lizards, which appealed to an older audience than the frogs did.\n\n\n\n"}

Standard Portuguese pronunciation, the prestige norm based on European Portuguese, is the reference for Portugal, the Portuguese-speaking African countries, East Timor and Macau. The word “European” was chosen to avoid the clash of “Portuguese Portuguese” (“'”) as opposed to Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nThe language is the same with different accents in many countries. It is a Latin based language, with Gaelic, Germanic, Greek and Arabic influence. It was spoken in the Iberian Peninsula before as Galician-Portuguese. With the formation of Portugal as a country in the 12th century, the language evolved into Portuguese. In the Spanish province of Galicia, Northern border of Portugal, the native language is Galician. Both Portuguese and Galician are very similar and natives can understand each other as they share the same recent common ancestor. Portuguese and Spanish are different languages, although they share 89% of their lexicon.\n\nPortuguese uses vowel height to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables; the vowels tend to be raised to when they are unstressed (see below for details). The dialects of Portugal are characterized by reducing vowels to a greater extent than others. Falling diphthongs are composed of a vowel followed by one of the high vowels or ; although rising diphthongs occur in the language as well, they can be interpreted as hiatuses.\n\nEuropean Portuguese possesses quite a wide range of vowel allophones:\n\nThe realization of this contrast occurs in a limited morphological context, namely in verbs conjugation between the first person plural present and past perfect indicative forms of verbs such as ('we think') and ('we thought'). proposes that it is a kind of crasis rather than phonemic distinction of and . It means that in 'we speak' there is the expected prenasal -raising: , while in 'we spoke' there are phonologically two in crasis: . Close-mid vowels and open-mid vowels ( and ) contrast only when they are stressed. In unstressed syllables, they occur in complementary distribution.\n\nAccording to Mateus and d'Andrade (2000:19), in European Portuguese, the stressed only occurs in the following three contexts:\n\nIn Greater Lisbon (according to NUTS III, which does not include Setúbal) can be centralized before palatal sounds (); e.g. , , , , .\n\nEuropean Portuguese possesses a near-close near-back unrounded vowel. It occurs in unstressed syllables such as in ('to grip'). There is no standard symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet for this sound. The \"IPA Handbook\" transcribes it as , but in Portuguese studies is traditionally used.\n\n\nThere are very few minimal pairs for this sound: some examples include ('to nail') vs. ('to preach'; the latter stemming from earlier < Latin ), ('be!') vs. ('see/cathedral') vs. ('if'), and ('hair') vs. ('I peel off') vs. ('for the'), after orthographic changes, all these three words are now spelled .\n\nEuropean Portuguese is divided into Northern and Southern varieties. The prestige norms are based on two varieties: that of Coimbra and that of Lisbon.\n\nPhonetically, differences emerge within Continental Portuguese. For example, in northern Portugal, the phonemes and are less differentiated than in the rest of the Portuguese speaking world (similar to the other languages of the Iberian peninsula). Also, the original alveolar trill remains common in many northern dialects (especially in rural areas), like Transmontano, Portuese, Minhoto, and much of Beirão. Another regionalism can be found in the south and the islands with the use of the gerund in the present progressive tense rather than the infinitive.\n\nPortuguese is spoken by a significant minority in Andorra and Luxembourg. The Principality of Andorra has shown interest in membership in the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP). There are also immigrant communities in France and Germany.\n\nThe Galician language, spoken in the Autonomous Community of Galicia in Spain, is very closely related to Portuguese. There is, as yet, no consensus among writers and linguists on whether Galician and Portuguese are still the same language (in fact they were for many centuries, Galician-Portuguese having developed in the region of the former Roman province of Gallaecia, from the Vulgar Latin that had been introduced by Roman soldiers, colonists and magistrates during the time of the Roman Empire) or distinct yet closely related languages.\n\nGalicia has expressed interest in joining the CPLP as an associate observer pending permission from the Spanish government.\n\nPortugal maintained its colonial rule over its Old World empire much longer than it did over Brazil. Thus European Portuguese is used as a norm of reference for African and Asian Lusophone countries (Angola, Cape Verde, East Timor, Guinea-Bissau, Macau, Mozambique, and São Tomé and Príncipe). Portugal remains a destination for post-secondary education for the elites of these places.\n\nThe Instituto Camões is an organization which promotes not only the Portuguese language but also Portuguese culture. Thus, it promotes European Portuguese as a norm for learners.\n\nRTP is the Portuguese public television network and also serves as a vehicle for European-Portuguese-providing media content throughout the world. There is a branch of RTP Internacional named RTP África, which serves Lusophone Africa.\n\nIn estimating the size of the speech community for European Portuguese, one must take into account the consequences of the Portuguese diaspora: immigrant communities located throughout the world in the Americas, Australia, Europe and Africa.\n\n\n"}

The band frequently headlined at Minneapolis's most influential music clubs, including Jay's Longhorn Bar and First Avenue.\n\nThe Suburbs were formed in the western suburbs of Minneapolis in 1977 following introductions by Chris Osgood of the Suicide Commandos. Following live performances, they released \"The Suburbs\" on the Twin/Tone label (the label's first release) in early 1978. The record was a nine-song 7-inch red vinyl EP. The band also saw two songs, \"Urban Guerrillas\" and \"Ailerons O.K.\", included on the compilation \"Big Hits of Mid-America, Volume Three.\" Guitarist Bruce C. Allen did the art direction for the compilation.\n\nAfter building a following playing basement parties, the Suburbs had their first major success at influential Minneapolis punk/New Wave nexus Jay's Longhorn Bar; drummer Hugo Klaers said that after getting regular gigs at the venue, \"we went from nobodies to this super popular band. It was just crazy. The Longhorn shows were always packed.\" One notable audience member at the Suburbs' shows was Bruce Springsteen, then on tour supporting his album \"The River\", who was so impressed with the band that he nearly joined them on stage for an encore. \nThe band's popularity increased during the early to mid-1980s, and during this time, their new wave dance sound, eclectic lyrics, and stage presence gained a following that broke out of the Midwest and reached both coasts. In 1980 Twin/Tone released their first full length LP, \"In Combo\".\n\nThe single \"World War III\" (and its B-side, \"Change Agent\") showed development of the band's songwriting abilities and improved sound. A year later, they released the double album \"Credit In Heaven\" which added elements of jazz, funk, and disco to the mix. The single \"Music for Boys\" was taken from the record and became a radio hit.\n\nIn 1982, the band released the 12-inch single \"Waiting\", which frequently found its way onto dance club playlists. The EP \"Dream Hog\" followed on Twin/Tone, featuring three new songs and a remix of \"Waiting\" on the B-side, all produced by Steven Greenberg of Funkytown and Lipps Inc fame.\n\nGreenberg then brought the Suburbs to the attention of Phonogram Inc. in 1983. Phonogram started by re-issuing \"Dream Hog\" on the Mercury label. Keyboardist/vocalist Chan Poling commented, \"We love what Twin/Tone did for us, but we've always wanted to sell records, to join the big time, and you just can't do that on a little label.\" By this time, the band's live performances were muscular and funky, attracting rabid fans and keeping the band busy as an opening act for the likes of Iggy Pop and The B-52's, as well as headliners in their own right. They often went on stage wearing matching dinner jackets. In 1983 Polygram released \"Love is the Law\", a harder-rocking album that included a horn section and some of their most off-beat lyrics, also produced by Steven Greenberg. In 1986, The Suburbs signed with A&M Records and released \"The Suburbs\", produced by Prince's Revolution drummer Bobby Z. (Robert Brent). Frustrated by a lack of radio play and abandoned by the major labels, the band broke up in 1987.\n\nIn 1992 Twin/Tone released \"Ladies and Gentlemen, The Suburbs Have Left the Building\", a best-of compilation, and in 1994 a live record \"Viva! Suburbs!\". The Suburbs reunited during this period and played numerous shows in the Twin Cities, and have played on and off since that time including opening once more for the B-52's in 2003.\n\nSummer of 2002 saw the re-issues of the albums \"In Combo\", \"Credit In Heaven\" and \"Love Is The Law\" on CD on the band's own Beejtar Records. In late 2003, the band issued \"Chemistry Set: The Songs Of The Suburbs 1977 - 1987\" (a best of CD with a few bonus tracks and a DVD of their 2002 performances at Minneapolis' First Avenue).\n\nIn 2004, Chan Poling formed The New Standards with John Munson and Steve Roehm, performing some of rearranged melodies of the classic Suburbs songs in the live set including \"Love Is The Law\".\n\nOn December 7, 2009, guitarist Bruce Allen died aged 54.\n\nOn November 19, 2013 \"Si Sauvage\", the band’s first new release in 27 years, was released. Si Sauvage features founding members Poling, Hugo Klaers, and Blaine John “Beej” Chaney, plus new bandmates Steve Brantseg and Steve Price and special guest vocalists like Janey Winterbauer and Aby Wolf.\n\nOn August 26, 2014, the Suburbs announced that founding member Beej Chaney was taking a temporary leave of absence.\n\n2018 has the band slated for several outdoor concerts: The Brewery Bash in Luverne, MN & Down By The Riverside Concert Series in Rochester, MN plus a show scheduled for (the landmark venue) First Avenue in Minneapolis.\n\n2019 the band continues to be led by original members Chan Poling & drummer Hugo Klaers plus longtime sax player Max Ray (also of The Wallets), they are augmented by current members Stevie Bransteg & Jeremy Ylvisaker are on guitars, Steve Prince on bass, Janey Winterbauer on backup vocals, Rochelle Becker on Bari Sax & Steven Kung on horns & keys. The band continued its live performances featuring new material plus classic Suburb songs, some of which are rearranged melodies that are toned down from the 1980's era (of the bands live shows).\n\nThe band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1818325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818325", "title": "Deep pocket", "text": "Deep pocket\n\nDeep pocket is an American slang term; it usually means \"extensive financial wealth or resources\". It is usually used in reference to big companies or organizations (ex: the American tobacco companies have \"deep pockets\"), although it can be used in reference to wealthy individuals (e.g., Bill Gates, Warren Buffett).\n\nIn the context of a lawsuit, the deep pocket is often the target defendant, even when the true (moral) culpability is with another party because the deep pocket has money to pay a verdict. For example, a lawyer may comment that he or she sued the manufacturer of a product rather than the seller because it is the deep pocket, meaning it has more money than the seller with which to compensate the victim.\n\nThe term “deep pockets” (also given as “deep pocket” and “deep pocketed\") is attested sparsely in the 1940s through the 1960s, but became popular with the litigation explosion of the 1970s.\n\nA person with “short arms and deep pockets” is a person (sometimes derided as “miserly” or “cheap\") who saves money and doesn’t often spend it. The term “short arms and deep/long pockets” is cited in print from at least 1952.\n\nIn Ireland, this phrase was attached to a wealthy businessman from Tipparary who, upon his round of drinks, would break his glass on the floor, knowing the owner of the pub would ask him to leave. This was also called the “O’Shea Fiddle”.\n\nDeep pocket is a concept often used in the law and economics of tort law. It refers to the idea that the risk of an activity should be borne by a person who is in a relatively good position to handle it. This can be achieved by either spreading the risk over a large number of risk-bearers (usually by means of insurance), or by imposing it on a person who is relatively risk-neutral. The latter is often assumed to be the case for wealthy individuals or large corporations, who are referred to as having \"deep pockets\", since their wealth will not be affected very strongly if the risk materializes. For example, a deep-pocket argument might, among other arguments, be used to justify product liability, as producers with \"deep pockets\" will normally be better able to accommodate the risk of damages than individual consumers not endowed with \"deep pockets\".\n\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court of Iowa labeled such legal theories \"deep pocket jurisprudence\". A review found four types of application:\n\nA variation on the term refers to the special subtype of frivolous litigation where plaintiffs target wealthy or corporate defendants for little other reason than them having high resources. These cases involve plaintiffs who have suffered genuine damages, but the true culpability lies squarely with an individual or small entity who has very little money that could be collected if the suit was won. Instead, the plaintiff targets the nearest marginally related large corporation or wealthy defendant, often with a weak accusation of negligence. A popular example is a person being shot by a criminal, and suing the manufacturer of the firearm instead of their attacker. Sometimes legislation is passed to prevent such lawsuits, such as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1818326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818326", "title": "Reproductive biology", "text": "Reproductive biology\n\nReproductive biology includes both sexual and asexual reproduction.\n\nReproductive biology includes a wide number of fields:\n\nHuman reproductive biology is primarily controlled through hormones, which send signals to the human reproductive structures to influence growth and maturation. These hormones are secreted by endocrine glands, and spread to different tissues in the human body. In humans, the pituitary gland synthesizes hormones used to control the activity of endocrine glands.\n\nInternal and external organs are included in the reproductive system. There are two reproductive systems including the male and female, which contain different organs from one another. These systems work together in order to produce offspring.\n\nThe female reproductive system includes the structures involved in ovulation, fertilization, development of an embryo, and birth.\n\nThese structures include:\n\nEstrogen is one of the sexual reproductive hormones that aid in the sexual reproductive system of the female.\n\nThe male reproductive system includes testes, rete testis, efferent ductules, epididymis, sex accessory glands, sex accessory ducts and external genitalia.\n\nTestosterone, an androgen, although present in both males and females, is relatively more abundant in males. Testosterone serves as one of the major sexual reproductive hormones in the male reproductive system However, the enzyme aromatase is present in testes and capable of synthesizing estrogens from androgens. Estrogens are present in high concentrations in luminal fluids of the male reproductive tract. Androgen and estrogen receptors are abundant in epithelial cells of the male reproductive tract.\n\nAnimal reproduction occurs by two modes of action, including both sexual and asexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction the generation of new organisms does not require the fusion sperm with an egg. However, in sexual reproduction new organisms are formed by the fusion of haploid sperm and eggs resulting in what is known as the zygote. Although animals exhibit both sexual and asexual reproduction the vast majority of animals reproduce by sexual reproduction.\n\nGametogenesis is the formation of gametes, or reproductive cells.\n\nSpermatogenesis is the production of sperm cells in the testis. In mature testes primordial germ cells divide mitotically to form the spermatogonia, which in turn generate spermatocytes by mitosis. Then each spermatocyte gives rise to four spermatids through meiosis. Spermatids are now haploid and undergo differentiation into sperm cells. Later in reproduction the sperm will fuse with a female oocyte to form the zygote.\n\nOogenesis is the formation of a cell who will produce one ovum and three polar bodies. Oogenesis begins in the female embryo with the production of oogonia from primordial germ cells. Like spermatogenesis, the primordial germ cell undergo mitotic division to form the cells that will later undergo meiosis, but will be halted at the prophase I stage. This is known as the primary oocyte. Human females are born with all the primary oocytes they will ever have. Starting at puberty the process of meiosis can complete resulting in the secondary oocyte and the first polar body. The secondary oocyte can later be fertilized with the male sperm.\n\n"}
{"id": "1818327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818327", "title": "Freshet", "text": "Freshet\n\nThe term freshet is most commonly used to describe a spring thaw resulting from snow and ice melt in rivers located in the upper North America. A spring freshet can sometimes last several weeks on large river systems, resulting in significant inundation of flood plains as the snowpack melts in the river's watershed. Freshets can occur with differing strength and duration depending upon the depth of the snowpack and the local average rates of warming temperatures. Deeper snowpacks which melt quickly can result in more severe flooding. Late spring melts allow for faster flooding; this is because the relatively longer days and higher solar angle allow for average melting temperatures to be reached quickly, causing snow to melt rapidly. Snowpacks at higher altitudes and in mountainous areas remain cold and tend to melt over a longer period of time and thus do not contribute to major flooding. Serious flooding from southern freshets are more often related to rain storms of large tropical weather systems rolling in from the South Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico, to add their powerful heating capacity to lesser snow packs. Tropically induced rainfall influenced quick melts can also affect snow cover to latitudes as far north as southern Canada, so long as the generally colder air mass is not blocking northward movement of low pressure systems.\nIn the eastern part of the continent, annual freshets occur from the Canadian Taiga ranging along both sides of the Great Lakes then down through the heavily forested Appalachian mountain chain and St. Lawrence valley from Northern Maine into barrier ranges in North Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nIn the western part of the continent, freshets occur throughout the generally much higher elevations of the various west coast mountain ranges that extend southward down from Alaska even into the northern parts of Arizona and New Mexico.\n\n\nFreshets are the result of the mass delivery of water to the landscape, either by snowmelt, heavy rains, or a combination of the two. Specifically, freshets occur when this water enters streams and results in flooding and high flow conditions. When freshets occur in the winter or early spring, the frozen ground can contribute to rapid flooding. This is because the meltwaters cannot easily infiltrate the frozen surface and instead run overland into rivers and streams, leading to a rapid flooding response. Deeper snow packs with large snow water equivalents (SWE) are capable of delivering larger quantities of water to rivers and streams, compared to smaller snowpacks, given that they reach adequate melting temperatures. When melting temperatures are reached quickly and snowmelt is rapid, flooding can be more intense. In areas where freshets dominate the hydrological regime, such as the Fraser River Basin in British Columbia, the timing of freshets is critical. In the Fraser River Basin, the annual freshet was observed 10 days earlier in 2006 compared to 1949. In these areas, earlier freshets can result in low flow conditions later in the summer or fall.\n\nFreshets may also occur due to rainfall events. Significant rainfall events can saturate the ground and lead to rapid inundation of streams, as well as contributing to snowmelt by delivering energy to snowpacks through advection. In the tropics, tropical storms and cyclones can lead to freshet events.\n\nThe magnitude of freshets depends on snow accumulation and temperature. Smaller freshets have been associated with El Niño conditions, where the milder conditions lead to lower snow accumulations. The opposite is true under La Niña conditions. Runoff from freshets is a major contributor of nutrients to lakes. In La Niña conditions with stronger freshets, higher runoff, and high nutrient inputs, more positive ecological indicator species (Arcellacea) are present in lakes, indicating lower levels of ecological stress. In El Niño conditions, smaller freshets contribute less runoff and result in lower nutrient inputs to lakes and rivers. In these conditions, fewer positive ecological indicator species are present.\n\nMigratory fish, such as salmon and trout, are highly responsive to freshets. In low flows present at the end of freshets, fish are more likely to ascend streams (move upstream). During high flows at the peak of a freshet, fish are more likely to descend streams.\n\nFreshets are often associated with high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streams and rivers. During base flows, water entering streams comes from deep in the soil where carbon contents are lower due to microbial digestion. During a freshet, water is more likely to run overland, where it dissolves the abundant, less degraded carbon present in the uppermost soil layers before entering streams. High dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels lead to an increase in the net primary productivity of the stream by enhancing microbial growth.\n\nThe 1997 Red River Valley Flood was the result of an exceptionally large freshet fed by large snow accumulations which melted due to rapidly warming temperatures, producing large volumes of meltwater which inundated the frozen ground. At the peak of the flood, the Red River reached a depth of and a maximum discharge of . This event has been referred to as “the flood of the century” in the areas impacted.\n\nThe Fraser River in British Columbia experiences yearly freshets fed by snowmelt in the spring and early summer. The largest freshet ever experienced in the Fraser River occurred in 1894 and resulted in an estimated peak discharge of and a peak height of at Hope, BC. However, due to the low population this flood had a minor impact compared to the second largest flood in 1948, which had a peak discharge of and a peak height of at Hope, BC. The 1948 flood caused extensive damage in the lower Fraser Valley and cost 20 million dollars at the time.\n\nIn 1972, the Susquehanna River which flows into Chesapeake Bay experienced a considerably large freshet due to Tropical Storm Agnes, resulting in flooding and increased sedimentation in Chesapeake Bay. At the peak of the flood on June 24, 1972, the instantaneous peak flow was greater than , and at the mouth of the river, the concentration of suspended solids was greater than 10,000 milligrams per liter.\n\n"}

It is stored and labeled separately so as to command a premium price. While there may never be an absolute monofloral type, some honeys are relatively pure due to the prodigious nectar production of a particular species, such as citrus (orange blossom honey), or there may be little else in bloom at the time.\n\nBeekeepers learn the predominant nectar sources of their region, and often plan harvests to keep especially fine ones separate. For example, in the southern Appalachians, sourwood honey, from a small tree that blooms late in the season, is highly regarded. Beekeepers try to remove the previously produced dark and strong flavored tulip poplar honey, just before the sourwood bloom, so it does not mix with the lighter sourwood. During sourwood bloom, there is little else for the bees to forage.\n\n\n"}

His parents, Ludwig Ferdinand and Therese Huber, née Heyne, were both writers. After the early death of his father, he was sent as a 6 years old to friends of his parents living in Hofwil, Switzerland.\n\nHuber graduated in medicine in 1820 and afterwards undertook several travels to France, Portugal, England, Spain and Italy. In 1828 Huber accepted a post as a teacher of history and modern languages at a gymnasium in Bremen, Germany. In 1832 he became a professor of modern and oriental languages in Rostock, in 1836 in Marburg and in 1843 professor for the history of literature in Berlin.\n\nHuber took part in the establishment of a conservative party in Prussia, from which he however withdrew after a short time because of the interests of feudal landlords. His real aim was to help the reintegration of workers into the civil society, and for this reason he gave up his professorship in Berlin in order to dedicate himself to the social questions of the day.\n\nSoon afterwards Huber was able to propose a new social model to improve the life conditions of low wage workers after visiting Manchester, in England, in 1844, where he acquainted himself with the housing and living conditions of factory workers. He named this model \"internal occupation\" (\"innere Ansiedlung\").\n\nHuber was one of the intellectual predecessors of the cooperative movement in Germany.

She was styled as Lady Bjelke-Petersen upon her husband's knighthood, and was also known informally as Lady Flo.\n\nFlorence Isabel Gilmour was born in Brisbane, as the eldest of two daughters of James Pollock Gilmour, an accountant and company secretary, and his wife Florence Mabel (née Low). She was raised at the Brisbane riverside suburb of New Farm. She started her schooling at the New Farm State School, and later attended the prestigious Brisbane Girls' Grammar School. She was employed as a private secretary to the Queensland Commissioner for Main Roads when she met Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, who was then a Country Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. They were married on 31 May 1952.\n\nBjelke-Petersen was preoccupied with home duties until well after Joh Bjelke-Petersen became Premier in 1968. In the 1970s, however, she assumed an increasingly public role, as part of the Queensland National Party's increasing promotion of a Bjelke-Petersen \"personality cult\". Her homey sayings and her recipes for pumpkin scones were quoted in the media.\n\nAt the 1980 federal election, against the wishes of party president Sir Robert Sparkes, Joh Bjelke-Petersen arranged for his wife to be placed in the number one position on the National Party's Queensland senate ticket, ensuring her election. Her term was due to commence on 1 July 1981, however, on 6 February 1981, Queensland Senator Glen Sheil resigned, creating a casual vacancy. She was appointed on 12 March 1981 for the remainder of Sheil's term, and then continued into her own term. It was speculated that her husband, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, intended entering federal politics, and that at some point Florence would resign from the Senate to allow Joh to be appointed to the vacancy. But Joh Bjelke-Petersen's federal aspirations ended with the failed \"Joh for Canberra\" campaign in 1987.\n\nWhen Joh Bjelke-Petersen was knighted in 1984, Flo Bjelke-Petersen became Lady Bjelke-Petersen, and was officially known as \"Senator Bjelke-Petersen\". She was frequently, but incorrectly, referred to as \"Lady Florence\" or \"Lady Flo\". This usage is for the daughter of a peer, not the wife of a knight. Although the name \"Lady Flo\" is incorrect, it has been almost universally used in the media and among the general public.\n\nShe was re-elected at the 1983 and 1987 elections (both double dissolutions), and her term expired on 30 June 1993.\n\nIn Canberra Lady Bjelke-Petersen was well liked by politicians of all parties, even those who loathed her husband. Her speeches were usually about local Queensland issues and seldom political in content.\n\nOn 20 December 2017, Bjelke-Petersen died in Kingaroy, Queensland, at Orana Aged Care, where she had resided since August 2014, at the age of 97, after suffering a short illness. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk offered to hold a state funeral which was accepted by their son John Bjelke-Petersen. It was held in the Kingaroy Town Hall.\n\nShe published a cookbook which included her recipe for her trademark pumpkin scones.\n\n"}

{"id": "1818359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818359", "title": "A Reader's Manifesto", "text": "A Reader's Manifesto\n\nA Reader's Manifesto is a 2002 book written by B. R. Myers that was originally published in heavily edited form in the July/August 2001 issue of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" magazine. Myers criticized what he saw as the growing pretentiousness of contemporary American literary fiction, especially in relation to genre fiction; he found it to be full of affectations and pretentious wordplay and lacking in strong storytelling.\n\nMyers described the original article, which saw no end of responses from admirers and critics, as \"a light-hearted polemic\" about modern literature. Myers was particularly concerned with what he saw as the growing pretentiousness of American literary fiction. He was skeptical about the value of elaborate, allusive prose and argued that what was praised as good writing was in fact the epitome of bad writing. His critique concentrated on E. Annie Proulx, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Auster, David Guterson, and Don DeLillo, all of whom enjoyed substantial acclaim from the literary establishment. Myers directed many of his harshest charges at literary critics for prestigious publications such as the \"New York Times Book Review\", whom he accused of lavishing praise upon bad writing either for political reasons, or because they did not understand it and therefore assumed it to have great artistic merit. Myers also focuses on what he calls \"the cult of the sentence\", criticizing critics for pulling single sentences out of novels in order to praise their brilliance, while ignoring shortcomings in the novel as a whole.\n\nMyers' article attracted heated criticism from aficionados of American literary fiction, especially of the authors Myers mentioned by name. Some critics charged Myers with being selective in his choice of targets, and of cherry picking particularly unreadable passages from the authors' works to make his point, with his methods described as 'clever, efficient and unfair' by \"New York Observer\" journalist Adam Begley. However, Myers used only previously quoted and critically praised passages in an attempt to avoid that criticism.\n\nMyers suggests there are only three possible responses when a critic is asked to review a work of literature:\n\n\nIn Myers' view, critics have created a system of self-serving criticism which protects, embraces, and aids certain authors.\n\nFor many critics, Myers was continuing the popular comments on postmodernism, of which John Gardner (\"On Moral Fiction\") was the most recent proponent.\n\nMyers explains and critiques the following five prose styles.\n\nMyers' central complaint regarding Proulx is her use of nonsensical images, mixed metaphors, and poor word choice, to create a disjointed \"slideshow\" effect. Myers says Proulx writes to \"startle or impress the reader.\" Myers asserts that this sort of writing must be read quickly, because if read slowly the meaning of the sentences falls apart. \"With good Mandarin prose the opposite is true,\" Myers says, comparing Proulx's writing unfavorably with that of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf. Myers criticizes Proulx for being \"too egocentric\" to put herself in the place of her characters when deciding what is important and what is unnecessary. He also mentions that maybe Proulx writes one thing but means something else, therefore emphasizing the importance of polishing. Myers writes, \"Someone needs to tell her that half of good writing is knowing what to leave out.\"\n\nMyers asks how DeLillo's theme of \"Life in Consumerland\" can still be considered edgy after it has been explored in literature for fifty years. He points out that much of DeLillo's writing consists of long \"shopping lists\" of brand name consumer items. Myers also criticizes DeLillo's development of characters who \"routinely talk and act like visitors from another planet.\" Myers asserts that DeLillo's characters serve primarily as vessels for DeLillo's thoughts, rather than as discrete characters. DeLillo, according to Myers, attempts to persuade his readers that if something does not make sense it is \"over their heads,\" or that \"something as inadequate as language can never do justice to the complexity of what they're trying to say.\" But Myers also points out that DeLillo uses a slippery sense of irony in his writing: \"As so often with DeLillo's musings, the 'conclusion' is phrased as a rhetorical question. 'If this works for you, take it,' he is saying, 'but if you think it's silly, hey—maybe I do too.'\"\n\nMyers criticizes McCarthy for filling his sentences with bulky words that contain no real detail or meaning. He uses the following as an example from \"The Crossing\": \"He ate the last of the eggs and wiped the plate with the tortilla and ate the tortilla and drank the last of the coffee and wiped his mouth and looked up and thanked her.\" Myers follows: \"This is a good example of what I call the andelope: a breathless string of simple declarative statements linked by the conjunction \"and\". Like the \"evocative\" slide-show and the Consumerland shopping-list, the andelope encourages skim-reading while keeping up the appearance of 'literary' length and complexity. But like the slide-show (and unlike the shopping-list), the andelope often clashes with the subject matter, and the unpunctuated flow of words bears no relation to the methodical meal that is being described.\"\n\nMcCarthy's prose, Myers quips, \"is unspeakable in every sense of the word,\" implying that it is both awful and frequently difficult to imagine a person saying. McCarthy's use of archaisms is also brought under scrutiny.\n\nMyers's critique of Auster suggests he over-describes situations, especially mentioning numerous details that are particularly mundane and obvious. By making a description too long, as Auster does, Myers says that an author encourages a reader to \"feel emboldened to ask why it needed to be said at all.\" Myers accuses Auster of \"simply wasting our time\" with his wordiness. Myers states that dragging on a point too long might cause it to go stale, as it did in Auster's passage from \"Timbuktu\". With an example from Auster's \"Moon Palace\", Myers describes how too many big and fancy words, used incorrectly, can discredit the speaker's intelligence. Myers also criticizes Auster for saying the same thing too many times; he states: \"Swing the hammer often enough, and you're bound to hit the nail on the head sometime—or so Auster seems to think.\"\n\nMyers critiques Guterson's novel \"Snow Falling on Cedars\" mainly for its \"sluggishness\" of words and \"echoic\" thought process. Myers concludes that \"Snow Falling on Cedars\" is no more than \"flat, stereotypical descriptions\" of characters in a given context, and, were its pace not slow, it would be considered a genre novel. Myers criticizes Guterson's average descriptions of predictable characters that have often been explored in literature, and complains that Guterson brings nothing new to the characters or story.\n\nMyers devotes a section of the book-length text to describing the response the shorter version published in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" received upon its publication. This portion of the book is an analysis of the criticisms of his original critique, and while it is written with Myers' characteristic \"humor\", it is the place in the book where he most aggressively defends his views. Here are the general areas of criticism Myers describes, and his own responses to them; the titles are Myers' titles.\n\nMyers' critics call him a philistine and an advocate for low-brow literature, and suggest that his criteria for good literature implicitly define it as writing that is simple enough to require little effort to read.\n\nMyers responds that books may also be difficult to read because of poor writing style, and he recommends other authors as examples of a complex style executed with skill.\n\nSeveral of Myers' critics claim the authors Myers featured were already discounted by the literary establishment.\n\nMyers was unable to find any evidence backing this claim, and responds to this argument with the absence of criticism for the authors and several examples of praise.\n\nCritics suggest that the very illogic and ambiguity Myers criticizes contains the value of the works: \"consoling riddles\", as one critic calls them.\n\nMyers states \"Literature need not answer every question it raises, but questions themselves should be clear.\" \"Difficult lucidity\" in Myers' opinion is what is missing from contemporary prose—the kind of writing that, as he says, \"rewards the use of a dictionary instead of punishing it.\"\n\nMyers responds to criticism that his complaints \"evinced faulty judgment\". Myers points out that the critics made no attempt to argue that the defamed excerpts deserved the praise originally lavished on them. Instead the critics based their arguments on a matter of perspective.\n\nSome critics have said that Myers is too harsh and negative in his reviews, and he looks at the substandard rather than the good sections of a literary work. Myers refutes these criticisms by stating that he uses the same excerpts that were previously praised by other critics.\nHe also explains that some good parts do not qualify a work of literary prose as being worth the money and time it costs to purchase and read. Myers claims that the writer has become more important than the writing and any failings \"only makes them more lovable\" in the eyes of the modern critic.\n\nCritics charge Myers with living in an \"imagined past\", in which all the authors were more talented.\n\nMyers agrees to a point, but gives the example of the National Book Award winners between 1990 and 2001 compared to those of 1950 through 1961 winners.\n\n1950 Nelson Algren...1990 Charles R. Johnson\n\n1951 William Faulkner...1991 Norman Rush\n\n1952 James Jones...1992 Cormac McCarthy\n\n1953 Ralph Ellison...1993 E. Annie Proulx\n\n1954 Saul Bellow...1994 William Gaddis\n\n1955 William Faulkner...1995 Philip Roth\n\n1956 John O'Hara...1996 Andrea Barrett\n\n1957 Wright Morris...1997 Charles Frazier\n\n1958 John Cheever...1998 Alice McDermott\n\n1959 Bernard Malamud...1999 Ha Jin\n\n1960 Philip Roth...2000 Susan Sontag\n\n1961 Conrad Richter...2001 Jonathan Franzen\n\nMyers says, \"Prize committees have always been unreliable judges of quality...still, it's worth noting that there was too much good writing around in the 1950s for even the prize committees to miss.\"\n\nMyers' critics accuse him of putting too much emphasis on reality.\n\nMyers responds that \"I love it when Bulgakov makes a cat talk, and when Gogol dresses a nose in a civil servant's uniform, and—if I may jerk the chain again—when Stephen King gives a car a mind of its own.\" He says that he instead, \"points out how absurd it is for the narrator of DeLillo's \"The Names\", the usual \"elliptical\" windbag, to claim that lying about one's destination creates a grave disparity in the listener's brain between the real and the false destination. In making this point I was merely judging \"The Names\"—as I judge every novel—by its own standards, in this case as a novel of serious ideas. (DeLillo himself has said that it represents 'a deeper level of seriousness.')\"\n\nMyers received many attacks on his history and character for his essay. For example, Judith Shulevitz criticized Myers for being a foreigner (he was an Army brat), unacquainted with the literary establishment he is criticizing.\n\nMyers responds, claiming that in these literary circles, social identity is more important than writing. Myers believes instead that a reader should trust his/her reason and intelligence to judge the writing, without necessarily being swayed by the \"reputation\" of the author.\n\nThe Appendix: Ten Rules for \"Serious\" Writers at the end of the book is an ironic set of guidelines for writing, each of which refers to a previous violation of successful prose that he has criticized. Myers implies that following these rules will lead to literary success.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n\nThe main authors criticized in \"A Readers Manifesto\" are Proulx, DeLillo, McCarthy, Auster, and Guterson. However, B. R. Myers also criticizes the following authors. He states pretentiousness can also be found in their prose.\n\n\n\nB. R. Myers provides favorable editors and critics as means to confirm his arguments. The following are present within the 2002 edition of \"A Reader's Manifesto\":\n\nIn \"A Reader's Manifesto\", Myers presents these novels as examples of clear, concise literary style:\n\n\n\n"}

The doctrine allows a junior user of a mark that is geographically remote from the senior user of the mark to establish priority over a senior user's claim to the mark in the junior user's area. The constructive use and notice sections of the Lanham Act limited the applicability of this doctrine.\n\nThe doctrine is named for two early twentieth-century United States Supreme Court cases, \"Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf\", (the \"Tea Rose\" case), and \"United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co.\".\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of \"Grupo Gigante SA De CV v.

The Eighth Circuit applies a four factor test to determine the area where the senior user's mark is protected. A junior user may no longer qualify as a good-faith, remote user if the junior user had knowledge of the senior user's mark.\n\nThe remote, good faith user doctrine only applies where the senior user is relying upon common law trademark rights or has a federal registration that post-dates the junior user's first use. A federal registration may allow the senior user to enforce his or her rights anywhere in the U.S., regardless of actual use in any particular location within the country. The principle underlying this doctrine has been codified as part of the Lanham Act, which permits Concurrent use registration where both parties had \"used\" the mark in good faith before either party had filed for a federal registration.\n"}
{"id": "1818374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818374", "title": "Tyndale University", "text": "Tyndale University\n\nTyndale University is a Christian university, a Canadian accredited Protestant institution of higher education in the evangelical tradition located in Toronto, Ontario. Tyndale students come from over 40 different Christian denominations. Tyndale offers undergraduate and graduate programs. A student residence is located on its campus.\n\nThe Toronto Bible Training School was founded in 1894 by a group of brethren under the supervision of Elmore Harris pastor of Walmer Road Baptist Church. Elmore Harris became the first President. William Boyd Stewart (former pastor of Bond Street Baptist Church) was the first Principal. Courses were held at the Walmer Road Church for the first four years until they relocated to new facilities the Gothic Revival building at 110 College Street (demolished after 1928 and now site of the University of Toronto's Banting and Best Department of Medical Research Building since 1930) in 1898 financed chiefly through generous contributions of the Harris family. (This land had been leased from the University of Toronto). The name of the school was changed to Toronto Bible College in 1912 and in September 1928 relocated to 16 Spadina Road (just north of Bloor Street and now Native Canadian Centre) when the lease expired. It became the first permanent Canadian Bible school and only the third in North America. The founders' vision of TBC was to train laypeople as \"Sunday School teachers, Pastors' Assistants, and as City, Home and Foreign Missionaries.\" The institution's leadership was largely Baptist and Presbyterian, but also included Methodists and Anglicans. The TBC graduation service was always a significant Toronto event, held initially at Massey Hall, and then moved to the University of Toronto's Varsity Stadium to accommodate crowds as large as 6,000.\n\nIn the 1940s, the school's president, John McNicol, steered a path between modernism and ultra-fundamentalism (specifically dispensationalism)--both of which McNicol denounced as threats to the health of the church. This unique position gained TBC the support of evangelicals in a variety of mainline denominations.\n\nIn 1968, Toronto Bible College merged with the London College of Bible and Missions from London, Ontario. LCBM began in 1935 as the London Bible Institute, led by J. Wilmot Mahood. The newly merged institution was named Ontario Bible College (OBC). This merger brought more students to the Toronto-based institution from other evangelical denominations including the Associated Gospel Churches, the Brethren, and the Mennonite Brethren. In 1976 OBC relocated to a former Jesuit seminary (Regis College) in Willowdale, Toronto (formerly City of North York), designed by modernist architect Peter Dickinson. In the same year, the institution also established a graduate school named Ontario Theological Seminary (OTS). OBC/OTS was given degree-granting powers by the Government of Ontario in 1986, and received full accreditation by the Association of Theological Schools in 1989.\n\nBy 1995, the institution had become insolvent and filed to make a proposal to creditors under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act in Canada. A new president, Brian Stiller, and CFO, Winston Ling, were brought on and a new board was chosen. In 1998 the school was renamed \"Tyndale College and Seminary\" after William Tyndale, a Reformation theologian of the sixteenth century. The leadership intended the name change to indicate their vision to build \"a world-class centre of Christian higher education in Canada.\"\n\nIn 2003, the Ontario Legislature authorized Tyndale to change its name to Tyndale University College and Seminary. Tyndale was also given the right to confer the Bachelor of Arts degree in the humanities, social sciences and business, as well as undergraduate, graduate and doctoral level degrees in religion, theology, and divinity. On December 5, 2007, Tyndale was given ministerial consent by the Province of Ontario to offer a Bachelor of Education program to prepare teachers for primary, junior, and intermediate grades.\n\nIn June 2006, Tyndale entered into an agreement to acquire a neighbouring facility, St. Joseph's Morrow Park, 3377 Bayview Avenue, from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Toronto. A key reason for Vatican approval of the pending transfer of the campus from Catholic to Protestant hands was Tyndale's commitment to maintain the aesthetically significant chapel as \"sacred space\". The facility transfer was completed on March 31, 2013, and all departments and offices were moved to 3377 Bayview Avenue in the Spring of 2015. The Catholic girls' high school will continue to operate in a wing of the property until at least June 2018.\nTyndale Seminary is the largest accredited seminary in Canada with more than 700 students at the masters or doctoral level, and the University College received high rankings in the 2009 \"Maclean's\" University issue's measure of student satisfaction (see below). In 2011, student satisfaction was amongst the highest of all Canadian universities. While students ranked the quality of teaching and classroom discussion above average, the \"Maclean's\" study also found the institution below average in some educational practices, including active and collaborative learning.\n\nIn January 2020, consent was granted by the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities for Tyndale to use the name \"university\" its title. Tyndale's corporate branding and logos were altered to reflect the change in name to Tyndale University.\n\nThe university offers the following degrees: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Religious Education, and Bachelor of Education.\n\nMajors in business administration, English, history, philosophy, psychology, and religious studies receive a foundation of general knowledge before moving on to their areas of specialization. Tyndale offers a Bachelor of Arts degree in human services conjointly with Seneca College, which allows a student to earn a BA degree from Tyndale plus a diploma in either early childhood education or social service work from Seneca. Graduates of the sixteen-month Bachelor of Education (BEd) program are eligible for a Certificate of Qualification from the Ontario College of Teachers. The Bachelor of Religious Education (BRE) is a three-year professional degree for students preparing for various forms of Christian ministry. Tyndale also offer a one-year Certificate in Christian Studies.\n\nIn 2008 Tyndale received the top score in the Canadian University Survey Consortium survey of students who agreed or strongly agreed that they are satisfied with the quality of teaching they have received; the results were subsequently published in the \"Maclean's\" 2009 University issue. Tyndale also ranked first overall in the number of students who strongly agreed that they are satisfied with their \"decision to attend this university\".\n\nThe seminary is the largest theological school in Canada accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. It is approved to grant the following graduate degrees: Doctor of Ministry, Master of Theology, Master of Divinity, and Master of Theological Studies. In addition, Tyndale Seminary also offers graduate diploma programs in six areas of concentration: Christian studies, leadership, missions, pastoral and Chinese ministry foundations, spiritual formation, and youth and family ministry. The seminary offers courses in the traditional day and evening format, as well as online and modular courses.\n\nTyndale Seminary offers all of the courses required by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy for certification as a Registered Marriage and Family Therapist. Graduates of this program can move toward credentialing in the Province of Ontario to offer psychotherapy in agencies (secular or Christian) or in private practice.\n\nIn 2006, an agreement was reached with the Association of Canadian Chinese Theological Education (ACCTE) to establish the Canadian Chinese School of Theology (CCST) at Tyndale Seminary for the training of Mandarin-speaking students and pastors. This led to a long-term agreement, which was signed in 2012.\n\nTyndale University houses five centres: the Hudson Taylor Centre for Chinese Ministries, the Tyndale Centre for Leadership, the Tyndale Intercultural Ministries Centre, the Tyndale Family Life Centre, and the Tyndale Spiritual Formation Centre. The Hudson Taylor Centre for Chinese Ministries, named after Hudson Taylor, has a mission to advance Chinese ministries in North America and around the world. The Tyndale Centre for Leadership is mandated to foster the development of Canadian Christian leaders in congregational contexts, Christian organizations, the marketplace and public sectors. The Tyndale Intercultural Ministries Centre's mandate is to link a vast network of local churches, denominations and mission organizations, in partnership with church and para-church organizations by offering training seminars and professional development workshops. The Tyndale Family Life Centre offers professional counselling and supportive workshops for the larger community and members of the general public. The seminary is also home of the \"Tyndale Spiritual Formation Centre\", including the Tyndale Association of Spiritual Directors.\n\nTyndale University is fully accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada to award its graduate theological degrees. The University is also accredited with the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities, as well as the Association for Biblical Higher Education. Tyndale is an affiliate of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities and the Christian Higher Education Canada (CHEC) association.\n\nTyndale University was scheduled to have former President of the United States, George W. Bush, speak at a breakfast hosted by Prem Watsa of Fairfax Financial Holdings on September 20, 2011. According to Tyndale professor Craig Carter, Bush “was to speak on the role of faith-based institutions in the world of higher education.” Upon learning of the scheduled event, a group of alumni launched a website protesting Tyndale’s association with Bush. After two days of online protests, the event was canceled \"due to a scheduling change” but no other explanation was given. Following the cancellation, Tyndale President and Vice Chancellor Gary Nelson noted the need for Tyndale \"to have clearer policies and guidelines in place so that diverse views can be expressed in a respectful and hospitable space.” He also expressed regret that Tyndale “did not have such a framework in place” and stated that \"Tyndale will continue to host various people to speak on issues that matter.\" The cancellation of Bush's visit garnered widespread attention from media outlets across Canada like the Toronto Star, the CBC, Maclean’s, and The Arena with Michael Coren. It was also covered by the Huffington Post and the Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\n\n"}

In 1184, his father, Béla III of Hungary, ordered that he be crowned king, and appointed him as ruler of Croatia and Dalmatia around 1195. Emeric ascended the throne after the death of his father. During the first four years of his reign, he fought his rebellious brother, Andrew, who forced Emeric to make him ruler of Croatia and Dalmatia as appanage.\n\nEmeric cooperated with the Holy See against the Bosnian Patarenes, whom the Catholic Church considered to be heretics. Taking advantage of a civil war, Emeric expanded his suzerainty over Serbia. He failed to prevent the Republic of Venice, which was assisted by crusaders of the Fourth Crusade, from seizing Zadar in 1202. He also could not impede the rise of Bulgaria along the southern frontiers of his kingdom. Emeric was the first Hungarian monarch to use the \"Árpád stripes\" as his personal coat of arms and to adopt the title of King of Serbia. Before his death, Emeric had his four-year-old son, Ladislaus III, crowned king.\n\nEmeric was the eldest child of Béla III of Hungary and Béla's first wife, Agnes of Antioch. His tutor was an Italian priest, Bernard. Nicholas, Archbishop of Esztergom, crowned the eight-year-old Emeric king on 16 May 1182, which confirmed Emeric's right to succeed his father. Emeric was betrothed to a daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, but she died in 1184. Béla III appointed Emeric to administer Croatia and Dalmatia around 1195.\n\nEmeric succeeded his father, who died on 23 April 1196. Béla III had bequeathed estates and money to Emeric's younger brother, Andrew, under the condition that Andrew should lead a crusade to the Holy Land. Instead, Andrew turned against Emeric, demanding a separate duchy for himself in 1197. Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, intervened on behalf of Andrew, and at the end of the year, their combined forces routed Emeric's troops at Mački, Slavonia. In early 1198, Emeric was forced to make Andrew Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia as an appanage. \n\nAndrew continued to conspire against Emeric, although Pope Innocent III continued urging Andrew to launch a crusade. On 10 March 1199, Emeric forced Boleslaus, Bishop of Vác, who was a supporter of Andrew, to give him documents that proved the conspiracy against him. In the summer of that year, Emeric defeated Andrew's army near Lake Balaton, which made Andrew flee to Austria. A papal legate named Gregory arrived in Hungary to mediate a reconciliation between the two brothers. According to the brothers' treaty, Emeric once again granted Croatia and Dalmatia to Andrew in the summer of 1200.\n\nFrom around 1200, Emeric was deeply involved in the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula. On 11 October 1200, Pope Innocent urged him to take measures to liquidate the \"heretics\" in Bosnia. Upon Emeric's request, the Pope refused to send a royal crown to Grand Prince Stephen of Serbia. Emeric invaded Serbia in 1201 or 1202, and helped Stephen's brother Vukan seize the throne. As a token of his suzerainty over Serbia, Emeric became the first Hungarian monarch to adopt the title of King of Serbia in 1202. He was also the first king to use a royal seal depicting the so-called \"Árpád stripes\", which eventually became part of the coat of arms of Hungary.\n\nIn the summer of 1202, the Venetian doge Enrico Dandolo signed a treaty with the leaders of the Fourth Crusade, who agreed to help the Venetians recapture Zadar, a town in Dalmatia, which had accepted the Hungarian monarchs' suzerainty since 1186. Even though Pope Innocent III forbade the crusaders to besiege Zadar, they seized the town on 24 November and gave it to the Venetians. Although the Pope excommunicated the Venetians and the crusaders upon Emeric's demand, Zadar remained under Venetian rule.\n\nIn fear of a crusade by Emeric, Ban Kulin of Bosnia held a synod of the Church of Bosnia at Bilino Polje on 6 April 1203. The synod acknowledged papal primacy and ordered the reform of the rites. Kulin also acknowledged Emeric's suzerainty. In a letter written in 1203, the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan informed Pope Innocent that Emeric had occupied five districts in Bulgaria, and Kaloyan demanded the Pope's intervention.\n\nDuke Andrew once again rose up in open rebellion against Emeric in the autumn of 1203. Their armies met at Varaždin on the river Drava in October. Emeric walked into his brother's camp unarmed, stating, \"Now I shall see who will dare to raise a hand to shed the blood of the royal lineage!\", according to the nearly contemporaneous Thomas the Archdeacon. Nobody ventured to stop the king; thus, he approached Andrew and seized him without resistance. Duke Andrew was held in captivity for months, but his supporters released him in early 1204. \n\nTaking advantage of the civil war in Hungary, Kaloyan invaded and captured Belgrade, Barancs (now Braničevo in Serbia), and other fortresses. Emeric made preparations for a campaign against Bulgaria, but he disbanded his army upon Pope Innocent's demand. The Pope, who had been negotiating a church union with Kaloyan, sent a royal crown to him, but Emeric imprisoned the papal legate who was delivering the crown to Bulgaria when the legate was passing through Hungary. \n\nHaving fallen seriously ill, Emeric had his four-year-old son, Ladislaus, crowned king on 26 August 1204. He also released the papal legate. He reconciled with his brother, \"entrusting to him the guardianship of his son and the administration of the entire kingdom until the ward should reach the age of majority\", according to Thomas the Archdeacon. Emeric died on 30 November, according to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\". Emeric was buried in the cathedral of Eger.\n\nEmeric's wife, Constance, was the daughter of King Alfonso II of Aragon. Their marriage took place between 1196 and 1200. Their only known child, Ladislaus, was born around 1200 and died on 7 May 1205. Queen Constance, who outlived both her husband and their son, was later married to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n"}

That is, if formula_1 is a symplectic manifold with smooth manifold formula_2 and symplectic form formula_3, then a vector field formula_4 in the Lie algebra formula_5 is symplectic if its flow preserves the symplectic structure. In other words, the Lie derivative of the vector field must vanish:\n\nAn alternative definition is that a vector field is symplectic if its interior product with the symplectic form is closed. (The interior product gives a map from vector fields to 1-forms, which is an isomorphism due to the nondegeneracy of a symplectic 2-form.) The equivalence of the definitions follows from the closedness of the symplectic form and Cartan's magic formula for the Lie derivative in terms of the exterior derivative. \n\nIf the interior product of a vector field with the symplectic form is an exact form (and in particular, a closed form), then it is called a Hamiltonian vector field. If the first De Rham cohomology group formula_7 of the manifold is trivial, all closed forms are exact, so all symplectic vector fields are Hamiltonian. That is, \"the obstruction to a symplectic vector field being Hamiltonian lives in formula_7.\" In particular, symplectic vector fields on simply connected manifolds are Hamiltonian.\n\nThe Lie bracket of two symplectic vector fields is Hamiltonian, and thus the collection of symplectic vector fields and the collection of Hamiltonian vector fields both form Lie algebras.\n"}

NFL had established Great Lakes Ferries Limited on March 31 but the name was subsequently changed only days later to Bay Ferries Management Limited on April 13. The company was registered in the State of New York (Monroe County) on June 29 of that year .\n\nThe company began using the name Bay Ferries Great Lakes, borrowing from the name of NFL's other high speed ferry subsidiary Bay Ferries Limited, to refer to its contracted operation on Lake Ontario on behalf of the Rochester Ferry Company LLC.\n\nBay Ferries Great Lakes announced that the service using \"Spirit of Ontario I\" would no longer use the CATS marketing name \"The Breeze\"; instead the service would be known as \"The Cat\", similar to the high speed ferry service operated by its sister company Bay Ferries Ltd. between Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and Bar Harbor, Maine since 1998.\n\nFerry operation resumed June 30, 2005. The fall 2005 season saw very light traffic using the ferry service and coupled with rising costs from record fuel prices, BFGL announced on December 8 that the vessel would stop service for the season effective December 12. BFGL committed to trying to find a winter charter for the vessel in the Caribbean to help off-set the high summer operating costs following the 2006 operating season.\n\nOn January 10, 2006, newly elected mayor of Rochester Robert Duffy announced that the city government would not be approving the ferry board's request for additional funding for the city's subsidiary Rochester Ferry Company LLC so that the service could resume in the summer. This effectively killed any hope that \"Spirit of Ontario I\" will return to its Lake Ontario operation. The city of Rochester owed BFGL $2.5 million in a revenue guarantee and the vessel will likely be sold.\n\nBFGL was contracted by the City of Rochester to manage the vessel in mothball status at the Rochester ferry terminal until a buyer could be found.

{"id": "1818498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818498", "title": "Wobulation", "text": "Wobulation\n\nWobulation is the known variation (or wobble) in a characteristic. For example, wobulation of advanced radar waveform modulations – where the repetition rate or centre frequency of a signal is changed in a repetitive fashion to reduce the probability of interception.\n\nIn large-screen television technology, wobulation is Hewlett-Packard's term for a form of interlacing designed for use with fixed pixel displays. The term is loosely derived from the word 'wobble' and was inspired by HP's work with the overlap of printing ink. Wobulation reduces the cost and complexity of components required for the creation of high resolution TVs.\n\nWobulation works by overlapping pixels. It does so by generating multiple sub-frames of data while an optical image shifting mechanism (e.g. the mirror of a digital micromirror device) then displaces the projected image of each sub-frame by a fraction of a pixel (e.g. one-half or one-third). The sub-frames are then projected in rapid succession, and appear to the human eye as if they are being projected simultaneously and superimposed. For example, a high-resolution HDTV video frame is divided into two sub-frames, A and B. Sub-frame A is projected, and then the miniature mirror on a digital micromirror device switches and displaces sub-frame B one half pixel length as it is projected. When projected in rapid succession, the sub-frames superimpose, and create to the human eye a complete and seamless image. If the video sub-frames are aligned so that the corners of the pixels in the second sub-frame are projected at the centers of the first, the illusion of double the resolution is achieved, like in an interlaced CRT display. Thus a lower resolution fixed pixel device using wobulation can emulate the picture of higher resolution fixed device, at a reduced cost.\n\n, wobulation is used only to double the horizontal resolution of a display, unlike CRT interlacing that doubles the vertical resolution. However, wobulation is capable of doubling the vertical and horizontal resolution of an image (2× wobulation). \n\nWhile wobulation can in theory be used in many types of display devices, it is currently primarily used in displays using Digital Light Processing (DLP). DLP is a Texas Instruments (TI) technology which relies on a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) chip. TI calls its implementation of wobulation 'SmoothPicture'. Horizontal wobulation used in current TI products allows a DMD chip with a 960×1080 mirror array to produce a 1920×1080 pixel picture; most recent designs employed in 3D DLP sets use \"offset-diamond pixel layout\", where the mirrors form a \"checkerboard pattern\" array. Also, the image overlap inherent in the use of wobulation eliminates the 'screen door' effect common on other fixed pixel displays such as plasma and LCD, but may in some implementations also create some reduction in sharpness. Wobulation is used by a number of TV manufacturers, including Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi, RCA, Samsung, and Toshiba.\n\nWobulation technology used in TVs is becoming obsolete, as manufacturers shift away from producing rear projection TVs.\n\n\n"}

The gorge has been formed by the Struma River, which flows from the Vitosha mountains. Kresna gorge has a rich biodiversity, which has come under pressure from the Struma motorway construction project, a new leg of the Trans European Corridor No. 4. In the south, the gorge bisects the Tisata nature reserve.\n\nKresna Gorge was the place of the Battle of Kresna Gorge between Bulgaria and Greece during the 1913 Second Balkan War. The Greek army was threatened by encirclement in the valley, but due to the Romanian army advancing against the undefended capital Sofia, Bulgaria had to agree to an armistice and the resulting peace treaty in Bucharest which was unfavorable to Bulgaria's territorial aspirations.\n\nKresna Gorge is situated near the villages of Palat, Drakata, and Krupnik while surrounded by the Pirin and Maleshevska Mountains. The gorge is a transitory Mediterranean climate, as it is located between the Central-European and Mediterranean climate zones. The Struma River cuts through the gorge and is a main geological feature. Near the riverbank are sediment soils which transition into shallow alluvial soil with maroon soil on the side. The rocky terrain varies throughout the gorge, including stony slopes, large vertical cliffs, and small rocky sections. \n\nKresna Gorge is home to a diverse fauna and flora, as well as a ranging terrain. The southern reaches of the gorge bisect the Tisata nature reserve in two. The gorge is home to many important Mediterranean plant species, habitats, landscapes, and bird wildlife. There are approximately 31 species of reptiles, 75 species of mammals, and 232 species of birds in this relatively small gorge. Kresna Gorge is considered a Natura 2000 conservation site, signifying its importance in the protection of endangered species. Some species of birds, such as cormorants, may not nest and breed in the gorge, but are utilizing its resources as part of longer passageways and migratory routes. The resources provided by the gorge are crucial, and serve as the main resting sites to threatened and rare species such as the Egyptian vulture. \n\nThere are multiple types of forests located inside the gorge, including different types of oak trees such as \"Quercus pubescens\", \"Carpinus orientalis\", and \"Fraxinus ornus\". Considering the climate, typical Mediterranean flora species such as \"Quercus coccifera\" and \"Phillyrea\" thrive here. The magnitude of the vegetation and plant population in Kresna provides a foundation for the varied populations of birds and other animals who lives here.\n\nThe Struma motorway, a project that is part of The European Transport Corridor No IV, is planned to cut through the Kresna Gorge. The motorway is seen by the European Union, as well as the Bulgarian government, as a vital trade and tourism route, and receives funding from the European Investment Bank (EIB). The motorway will provide a passageway from Germany and Hungary to Greece, and aims to boost the Bulgarian economy. The project, however, will also have some destructive effects for the inhabitants of the gorge and its ecosystem. With the current road in the gorge, lack of proper mitigation has already led to many road kills over the years; with the construction of the new motorway project, animal mortality rate is expected to increase, not just because of direct traffic accidents but also because of the effects of deforestation and habitat loss. \n\nThe locals in the nearby villages are afraid their shops and livelihoods will be deserted when the motorway opens. They also fear that Kresna will attract fewer tourists and that young residents will migrate to other countries. The motorway will force some of the villagers to lose land and property during the construction, negatively impacting their livelihoods.\n"}

{"id": "1818561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818561", "title": "California State Route 75", "text": "California State Route 75\n\nState Route 75 (SR 75) is a expressway in San Diego County, California. The state highway is a loop route of Interstate 5 (I-5) that begins near Imperial Beach, heading west on Palm Avenue. The route continues north along the Silver Strand, a thin strip of land, through Silver Strand State Beach. SR 75 passes through the city of Coronado as Orange Avenue and continues onto the San Diego–Coronado Bay Bridge, which traverses the San Diego Bay, before joining back with I-5 near downtown San Diego at a freeway interchange.\n\nThe Silver Strand Highway was constructed and open to the public by 1924. What would become SR 75 was added to the state highway system in 1933, and designated Legislative Route 199 in 1935. SR 75 was not officially designated until the 1964 state highway renumbering. The Coronado Bay Bridge opened in 1969, and provided a direct connection between San Diego and Coronado. Since then, various proposals have taken place to relieve commuter traffic between San Diego and Naval Air Station North Island that traverses the city of Coronado. However, none of these proposals have gained support, including an attempt in 2010.\n\nSR 75 begins as Palm Avenue at I-5 in the San Ysidro neighborhood of San Diego, heading westbound from the Southland Plaza mall. The route travels between the communities of Palm City and Nestor before entering the city limits of Imperial Beach. There, SR 75 curves to the north, becoming Silver Strand Boulevard and crossing into Coronado. SR 75 continues onto the peninsula containing Coronado Island, separated from the mainland by San Diego Bay. The highway passes through the Silver Strand Training Complex and the South Bay Study Area before entering the Coronado Cays subdivision and paralleling Silver Strand State Beach.\n\nAfter this, SR 75 passes through the United States Naval Amphibious Base for a few miles before entering downtown Coronado. The highway becomes Orange Avenue and turns north-northeast as the main street through Coronado. SR 75 intersects SR 282 at the one-way couplet of Third and Fourth Streets; SR 282 continues west on Third Street and returns to SR 75 on Fourth Street, while SR 75 continues east on Fourth Street and heads west towards Orange Avenue on Third Street. The one-way couplet is brief, and SR 75 becomes a divided highway before crossing the Coronado Bridge. While on the bridge, SR 75 crosses into the city of San Diego again.\nOnce on the mainland, SR 75 has a northbound exit to National Avenue and a southbound entrance from Cesar E. Chavez Parkway. Through traffic is directed onto I-5 south or north in Logan Heights, where SR 75 ends.\n\nSR 75 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System. It is officially designated as a scenic route for nearly its entire length, from the Imperial Beach city limit to Avenida del Sol in Coronado, and the portion across the Coronado Bridge meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. SR 75 is also part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2013, SR 75 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 66,000 on the Coronado Bridge (the highest AADT for the highway), and 16,000 between Rainbow Drive and 7th Street in Imperial Beach (the lowest AADT for the highway).\n\nThe intersection of Third Street and Orange Avenue dates back to at least 1890. The process of paving portions of Orange Avenue began in 1893, with an estimated cost of $50,000 (about $ in dollars); of sidewalks were also included. The plan was to make the avenue \"one of the most beautiful in Southern California.\" From Palm City to Imperial Beach, the road was paved by 1920. The Silver Strand Highway opened in 1924 during a festival at the Tent City summer resort in Coronado, and went from Coronado to Palm City. By 1928, all streets in the city of Coronado had been paved, which was expected to encourage people to visit Tent City.\n\nPlans to transfer the Silver Strand Highway to state maintenance were in place as early as November 1931, and were to take effect once Silver Strand State Park was completed and open. In 1933, the highway from the San Diego–Coronado Ferry to Route 2 (now I-5) was added to the state highway system, and was designated as Legislative Route 199 two years later. By that same year, Sign Route 75 was posted from U.S. Route 101 (US 101) in Palm City to the ferry landing. After a subsequent highway project around 1939, SR 75 passed through Tent City and, according to William Cecil, the city's public works director in 1998, \"contributed to its demise.\"\n\nThe first contract for widening the highway between Coronado and Coronado Heights was awarded in 1944, as this part of the road was \"now too narrow and dilapidated to meet traffic requirements.\" The State Highway Commission allocated $25,000 (about $ in dollars) to install traffic signals at the intersection of SR 75 and US 101 in March 1951. Plans to widen the road to four lanes were put on hold in July.\n\nBy July 1952, it had been disclosed that some local businesses near Palm City had lodged opposition to the widening of the highway after $500,000 (about $ in dollars) had been allocated to the project. Following protests from local businessmen regarding the design of the median, the planned removal of access to intersecting streets, and the planned changes to street parking, Governor Earl Warren wrote to the San Diego Public Safety Committee, hoping to have the dispute resolved. In November, funds were allocated to acquire land for the construction in the 1953–1954 state budget. A year later, $430,000 (about $ in dollars) had been allocated to the widening project. A contract was given to the Daley Corporation to carry out the construction in 1955. The highway was to be widened to four lanes, and would add three pedestrian crossings. The completion of the widening project was announced on August 10, 1956. The final cost of the project was $850,000 (about $ in dollars), with money from the City of Coronado and the state.\n\nDiscussion regarding a bridge dates back to 1926; however, the Navy opposed the plan over concerns that an enemy could destroy the bridge and trap ships in the harbor. In 1955, the California Senate approved $200,000 (about $ in dollars) to conduct a study regarding a possible vehicular tunnel from San Diego to Coronado. Later, in June 1961, a proposal for an underwater tube along SR 75 was formally proposed, and would not have needed the approval of the residents of Coronado. Interviews of commuters were planned in August, to determine the traffic patterns along SR 75. The survey took place on October 2 along Silver Strand Boulevard.\n\nThe SR 75 designation was originally established in 1963 with two segments: from I-5 to the ferry across San Diego Bay from Coronado to downtown, and from SR 125 to I-5. In 1967, the Coronado Bridge was scheduled to be added to the route once it was completed, and the portion from Fourth Street to the ferry was deemed as temporary until the bridge opened. Construction began in February. Coronado residents largely opposed the bridge, but Governor Pat Brown \"overrode their wishes\" according to former city councilman Bob Odiorne, who also claimed that the opposition caused the city to lose opportunities to move the approaches to the bridge away from residential areas. Following attempts from Barbara Hutchinson, the vice president of the Kearny Mesa Town Council, to ask the Coronado and San Diego city councils to intervene in the construction, San Diego city attorney Edward Butler stated that the state had the ultimate authority to decide whether or not to build the bridge, and that the City of San Diego could not interfere. Before the bridge opened, in 1968, the changes originally proposed by the Legislature in 1967 were made to the law; the designation came into effect on February 21, 1969. The bridge eventually opened on August 3, 1969.\n\nBy 1969, Palm Avenue was the primary commercial street in Imperial Beach, and was described by the \"San Diego Union\" as \"a strip of large signs and businesses. It is not a 'downtown.'\" Plans were under way to add an interchange at Silver Strand State Beach for the Coronado Cays development. In September, the City of Coronado added Orange Avenue south of Third Street as a truck route leading to the base. By May 1970, the part of SR 75 on the Coronado Bridge had been declared a scenic highway. President Richard Nixon and Mexican president Díaz Ordaz used Orange Avenue as a motorcade route on September 3, 1970, en route to the Hotel del Coronado.\n\nProposition N was proposed in 1974 to attempt to resolve concerns regarding traffic in Coronado. The plan was to build another highway along the northern and eastern shore of Coronado Island, to bypass the busy residential and commercial districts and provide easy access to the Silver Strand from the western end of the bridge. The proposition asked voters whether the City Council should \"actively pursue\" the matter. Critics contended that the highway would block the view of the San Diego Bay, and that the city would be unable to alter traffic patterns in the meantime. Coronado mayor Rolland McNeely opposed the proposal in early November 1974 as it would require approval from over thirty government agencies and would force the city to continue with building this road, although some declared it \"impossible to build.\" The voters rejected this plan.\n\nThe portion of SR 75 from Pomona Avenue in Coronado to Imperial Beach was also recommended to become a scenic highway in February 1974. Future improvements to the Imperial Beach – Coronado portion were cancelled in April. In 1976, the California State Legislature renumbered the portion from I-5 to SR 125 as SR 117, which later became SR 905. The change took effect at the beginning of 1977. The renumbering was to reduce confusion with the Coronado portion, according to Caltrans regional director Jacob Dekema; new signs were to be put into place shortly thereafter. The bridge and the resulting traffic continued to be a hotly debated issue in the early 1980s. A plan in 1981 to convert Fourth Street into an expressway leading to the naval station was strongly opposed by the public due to the required demolition of structures and a lack of evidence that the plan would succeed in reducing traffic; by this time, Third and Fourth streets had been converted into one-way streets between the bridge and the naval station. A major renovation of the bridge was scheduled for late 1992, which would include a movable barrier to prevent head-on collisions and necessary resurfacing of the roadway. Work was underway in January 1993 on the $4 million project (about $ in dollars), but it was behind the three-month schedule by 11 days due to rainfall and was expected to be completed by March.\n\nWhen the Coronado Bridge opened, a toll of 60 cents was charged to use the bridge. In 1980, the toll became $1.20, charged only in the westbound direction towards Coronado. A seventh toll booth was to be constructed in September 1987. The toll dropped to $1 in 1988. The bridge tolls ended at 10 p.m. on June 27, 2002, after the San Diego Association of Governments decided to stop collecting tolls; drivers paid a total of $197 million throughout the years. The speed limit was decreased to in October 2005 along Third and Fourth streets, after traffic increased by 20 percent following the removal of the toll. Traffic barriers along Third Street to block traffic from turning onto intersecting streets were removed in November 2004, following voter approval.\n\nThe City of Coronado has attempted to have a tunnel built from the Coronado bridge to the San Diego Naval Base numerous times, and hired Ledford Enterprises to help with the lobbying process in 2002 and 2006. The city endorsed a proposed study in 2004 to determine possible alternatives to resolve the traffic issues, which included keeping the status quo. On June 8, 2010, Coronado voters decided against Proposition H, which would have advised the city to undergo further investigation into building the tunnel. This concluded ten years of studies and proposals by the city of Coronado to find a way to reduce traffic to the naval station during rush hour. Critics of the proposal did not believe that the tunnel would resolve the traffic issues on the northern part of SR 75 or on SR 282. Following this, the Coronado City Council voted to abolish the Tunnel Commission that had been formed to study the issue.\n\nEfforts were underway by Imperial Beach city officials to improve the reputation and economic standing of the Palm Avenue area in the first decade of the 21st century. The area was described by the \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" as a \"hodgepodge of vacant land and aging apartment buildings and businesses, many in need of a coat of paint\" in 2003. Residents hoped to revitalize the area, providing commerce right next to an entrance to the beach. City officials offered local business owners loans for necessary construction or rehabilitation in 2005. The Imperial Beach city council approved the redevelopment of the Palm Avenue corridor in 2008, following a study in 2003. A Palm Avenue Commercial Corridor Master Plan was endorsed in February 2009, in efforts to improve the commercial area. In September 2012, the Imperial Beach city council raised objections over the Caltrans decision to increase the speed limit on SR 75 to from on the portion of the highway from Delaware Street to the western Imperial Beach city limit due to concerns about safety. The rest of the highway was to retain the speed limit.\n\n"}

{"id": "1818580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818580", "title": "California State Route 76", "text": "California State Route 76\n\nState Route 76 (SR 76) is a state highway long in the U.S. state of California. It is a much used east–west route in the North County region of San Diego County that begins in Oceanside near Interstate 5 (I-5) and continues east. The highway is a major route through the region, passing through the community of Bonsall and providing access to Fallbrook. East of the junction with I-15, SR 76 goes through Pala and Pauma Valley before terminating at SR 79.\n\nA route along the corridor has existed since the early 20th century, as has the bridge over the San Luis Rey River near Bonsall. The route was added to the state highway system in 1933, and was officially designated by the California State Legislature as SR 76 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. The section of the highway through Oceanside and Bonsall is mostly a four-lane expressway; east of I-15, SR 76 is mostly a two-lane highway. Originally, the entire highway was two lanes wide; west of Bonsall, the route was widened in stages, after decades of funding shortages, planning, and litigation. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) maintained plans to expand the entire length of the highway west of I-15 to an expressway, and as of May 2017, construction between Bonsall and I-15 was complete.\n\nThe roadway carrying the SR 76 designation begins at County Route S21 (CR S21) in Oceanside, although Caltrans does not consider the road west of I-5 to be part of the route, and it is not in the legal definition. There is soon an interchange with I-5, after which SR 76 becomes a four-lane expressway known as the San Luis Rey Mission Expressway. From I-5 to Mission Avenue, the highway parallels the San Luis Rey River until it passes by the Oceanside Municipal Airport. During this stretch, SR 76 intersects Loretta Street, Canyon Drive, Benet Road, Airport Road, and Foussat Road. There are two overpasses: one over Mission Avenue, and one over El Camino Real, before the road intersects Douglas Drive, the main road to the San Luis Rey gate of Camp Pendleton. After an intersection with Rancho Del Oro Road, SR 76 passes over Mission Avenue again before intersecting with Old Grove Road, Frazee Road, a turnoff into the Towne Center North shopping center, and College Boulevard.\nAs it enters rural Oceanside, SR 76 intersects with North Santa Fe Avenue (CR S14), Guajome Lake Road (near Guajome County Park), and Melrose Drive. SR 76 intersects the southern segment of CR S13, known as East Vista Way, and passes over the San Luis Rey River on roughly parallel bridges before an intersection at North River Road. The highway passes through Bonsall, intersecting Via Montellano, Olive Hill Road, and Throughbred Lane. SR 76 then meets the northern segment of CR S13, known as South Mission Road, while heading north into Fallbrook; SR 76 is the primary road connecting the two portions of CR S13. Here, SR 76 becomes known as Pala Road. It intersects Via Monserate and Gird Road south of Fallbrook before crossing the former routing of US 395 and the current routing of I-15 in the community of Pala Mesa Village.\n\nSR 76 then goes through Pala and the Pala Indian Reservation, providing access to the Pala Casino and intersecting CR S16, the turnoff to the Pala Mission and Temecula. Continuing to parallel the San Luis Rey River, SR 76 passes by the Wilderness Gardens County Park before entering the community of Pauma Valley and meeting the southern terminus of CR S7 (Nate Harrison Grade), a dirt road leading into Palomar Mountain State Park. SR 76 intersects the southern leg of CR S6 (Valley Center Road), leading to Valley Center and Escondido. East of the small Yuima Indian Reservation, it then encounters the northern leg of CR S6, the southern approach to the Palomar Observatory and Palomar Mountain State Park, as well as the community of La Jolla Amago. It then briefly passes through the Cleveland National Forest and meets the eastern terminus of CR S7, the eastern approach to Palomar Mountain. SR 76 then passes along the shores of Lake Henshaw before terminating at the intersection with SR 79 at Morettis Junction, southeast of Lake Henshaw.\nFrom I-5 to I-15, SR 76 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 76 is legally eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The part of the highway from the western terminus to Douglas Drive is also named for Tony Zeppetella, an Oceanside police officer killed while on duty performing a traffic stop in 2003. In 2014, SR 76 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 1,400 between East Palomar Road and the eastern terminus at SR 79, and 55,000 between Airport Road and El Camino Real in Oceanside, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.\n\nThe road through the San Luis Rey Valley was planned as early as 1889, and was constructed during the early 20th century. It was added to the state highway system in 1933, while the condition of the highway continued to improve. The San Luis Rey Mission Expressway was eventually constructed during the 1990s and 2000s, and efforts to extend the expressway east to I-15 were completed during the 2010s.\n\nPlans by the City of Oceanside for a road east through the San Luis Rey Valley to Fallbrook date from June 1889, and included a bridge over the San Luis Rey River. Construction on the bridge over the river at Bonsall had commenced by October 1906, and the bridge was to be long. In November, the road to the bridge was under construction; originally, the bridge was to serve the road from Escondido to Temecula. A survey was commissioned in 1908 to replace the road along the south bank of the river with one along the north bank to Pala, as the former was sandy and difficult for travel. State funding issues for the Pala road by May 1912 that prevented completion, though the planned road had been surveyed from Bonsall, where it met with the Escondido road, to Oceanside.\n\nFlooding in January 1916 resulted in the closing of the pre-existing road between Bonsall and Pala; part of it reopened in October. Nevertheless, of the road between Pauma Valley and Pala did not reopen for two years. Meanwhile, a road from Pala to Warner Springs neared completion in March 1918, though a bridge would be necessary for the road to be usable during the winter months. By mid-1921, plans were underway to pave Mission Avenue through the Oceanside city limits. The first east from Oceanside were paved by November 1924. The Bonsall Bridge over the San Luis Rey River was completed in 1925, and opened in 1926 as the county's largest bridge at the time; it served as part of the road from San Diego to Elsinore. The Pala road was constructed by 1930, although it was not paved east of Pala.\n\nThe road that extended from US 101 in Oceanside all the way to SR 79 near Lake Henshaw was originally added to the state highway system in 1933, but was not designated as legislative Route 195 until 1935. By 1936, US 395 was signed along what would become SR 76 through Bonsall, as part of the route between Elsinore and San Diego. In 1943, work began on widening the approaches to the Bonsall bridge. US 395 had been shifted east away from Bonsall by 1949. SR 76 was signed by 1954. During the 1964 state highway renumbering, Route 195 was legally redesignated as State Route 76; at that time, the legal definition was updated to reflect the new designation of I-5, replacing US 101.\n\nThe original idea for constructing a replacement for Mission Avenue dates from 1950. By 1961, there were plans to make SR 76 a freeway from Oceanside to Fallbrook Road, and an expressway from there to US 395. The following year, the new Highway 76 Association formed a committee to promote the upgrade of the road into Pauma Valley. In 1963, more specific plans were proposed by the Highway Development Association initiative, including making the portions from Foussat Road and the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia and from Vista Way to Mission Road an expressway, and widening the part of the highway in Oceanside. In 1964, the state allocated funds for the widening of SR 76 to four lanes in Oceanside, and in October 1965, the first portion of the widening from Carey Road to Frontier Drive entered the bidding phase. The next part of the widening entered the bidding phase in December 1968, and extended from Frontier Drive to near the Mission.\n\nCaltrans engineer Jacob Dekema announced in April 1969 that construction on SR 76 and the nearby SR 78 between I-5 and US 395 would be delayed until work on I-5 and US 395 was underway, or at least until 1976. Nevertheless, a widening project was commissioned in 1970 between Pauma Reservation Road and Cole Grade Road, well east of US 395. The next year, construction began on a new interchange between the future routing of SR 76 and I-5, near Oceanside Harbor and Camp Del Mar in Camp Pendleton. The expansion of SR 76 appeared on the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) regional government plan in late 1974. At that time, there was an effort by the City of Oceanside to have SR 76 included as a scenic highway, but SR 76 has not been included in the system. The Chamber of Commerce decided to continue efforts to have SR 76 expanded at the end of 1974.\n\nIn January 1975, Caltrans presented plans to realign SR 76 away from Mission Avenue and move it to the south side of the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After this, at the start of the next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR 76 would be delayed because of the funding issues and the relatively low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully delaying the project by delaying the release of the environmental impact report. A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County leaders, with the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1977, Oceanside police kept track of over 1,000 accidents that occurred along SR 76. A citizen action group known as Concerned Citizens for Highway 76 formed soon after. Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway as opposed to a freeway or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of a freeway, and building a route through an environmentally sensitive area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, and Caltrans as to why certain projects, including SR 76, had not been started.\n\nIn the meantime, the Oceanside Development Agency recommended that the new highway be extended west to Pacific Street to aid in redeveloping the downtown area. The San Diego Regional Coastal Commission disagreed with constructing the highway, among other development proposals for downtown Oceanside, due to concerns about destroying habitat along the river and the marsh areas. Soon after, in October 1980, the California Coastal Commission recommended removing the realignment of the freeway from plans entirely, on environmental grounds.\n\nIn 1983, the introduction of a federal gasoline tax of five cents per gallon (one cent per liter) added more funding to complete projects in San Diego County, among other places. From that revenue, $5 million (about $ in dollars) was allocated to rebuilding the Bonsall bridge and realigning the highway. Issues cited with the old bridge included the sharp turns at either end and its narrow width, though some members of the community hoped that the old bridge would remain standing as a historical landmark, and a pedestrian bridge. County Supervisor Paul Eckert commissioned a campaign to leave the bridge standing a week later. Plans to replace the bridge were delayed by April, due to issues acquiring the land necessary for the new bridge.\n\nCaltrans tentatively approved the westernmost of the SR 76 widening project in May, while noting that there were several more steps in the legal process necessary before construction began. Two years later, concerns were expressed by environmental groups over the potential destruction of the habitat of the least Bell's vireo songbird by the construction of SR 76 and other projects in the region. In 1986, the bird was added to the federal endangered species register. The next year, the Oceanside Jaycees group collected 12,000 signatures supporting the construction of the freeway immediately. At that time, the fatality rate on SR 76 was 222 percent above that of any other state highway in California. The petitions were given to the office of then-Governor George Deukmejian. In November 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved the project, on condition that Caltrans purchase more land to set up habitat for environmental mitigation.\n\nFunds for the new Bonsall bridge were approved by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) in October 1988, and construction was scheduled to begin in early 1989. In November 1989, the California Coastal Commission gave the go-ahead for the realignment of SR 76 in western Oceanside, from I-5 to Frontier Drive. However, in February 1990, the Sierra Club, National Audubon Society, and League for Coastal Protection filed a lawsuit to have the approval overturned, citing concerns over the destruction of habitat. The Bonsall bridge was completed in early 1990, while the old bridge became a National Historic Place. In 1992, the City of Oceanside offered to purchase land as additional habitat for the songbird, even though it was not a party to the lawsuit. The following year, the City Council voted to use the Lawrence Canyon land for commercial use instead of for the environmental mitigation, thus stalling the project. Following this, the CTC rejected the proposal to build the highway, requiring Caltrans to find another parcel to use for constructing habitat. The CTC did approve the proposal a month later, provided that this land was found before construction began. In October, the City Council decided to use the Lawrence Canyon land for mitigation after all. Nevertheless, a city councilman raised concerns that the expressway would not be adequate to handle 2010 traffic levels.\n\nThe four-lane expressway bypass of Oceanside was constructed beginning in 1994. The first from I-5 to Foussat Road opened to traffic in late 1995. The cost of this portion was $10 million (about $ in dollars); at that time, completion of the rest of the route was expected for 2008. The rerouting of SR 76 away from Mission Avenue resulted in a decrease in business for establishments located along the old routing. On June 12, 1996, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second phase of the project took place, by which time the completion date for the entire roadway had slipped to 2010. This phase between Foussat Road and Jefferies Ranch Road was finished in late 1999. Because the expressway was constructed on top of Mission Avenue east of Old Grove Road, the former was rerouted onto a new alignment that connected to Frazee Road. Mission Avenue was thus fragmented, and does not exist between Frazee Road and Jefferies Ranch Road, where the designation resumes.\n\nBy 2002, Caltrans had two proposals for the part of the widening project between East Vista Way and Mission Road: building the new highway on top of the old one, or constructing a new roadway to the south of the San Luis Rey River. Concerns arose that the TransNet local sales tax would not be extended by voters, leading to the cancellation of that project. The San Diego Association of Governments included the widening east to Bonsall in the regional plan in 2003, but indicated that the portion from Bonsall to I-15 would be dependent on the availability of funding. Residents of Fallbrook and Bonsall criticized the fact that SR 76 was one of the few TransNet projects that was not to be completed by the expiration of the tax in 2008. The city of Oceanside proposed plans for grade-separated interchanges with College Boulevard and Melrose Drive in 2004, as part of a proposal to convert the expressway through Oceanside to a freeway. After complaints from residents, these proposals were tabled.\n\nAfter TransNet was renewed in November 2004, planning continued for widening the remaining portion of SR 76 west of I-15, due to the frequent accidents that occurred on the eastern portion, although some claimed that the habits of drivers were at fault. The 2007 environmental impact report recommended constructing the new roadway along the route of the old one, rather than moving the entire highway south.\n\nMeanwhile, congestion east of I-15 increased with the opening of four new casinos near Pala. The Pala Indian band was required to pay for the costs to improve the road to mitigate the increased traffic levels from their proposed expansion. Construction began on widening the highway in April 2008, and in March 2009, two lanes of a realigned segment of SR 76 opened east of I-15. Initially, only two lanes were open, with the other two lanes of this new four-lane divided highway planned to open in September 2009. This improvement was intended to reduce accidents on a stretch of road that carried over 12,000 motorists per day, many headed for either the Pala Indian casino or a new gravel quarry that had recently opened. The casino and quarry owners each paid for half of the $26 million (about $ in dollars) cost of the new road. Even after this, in 2009, the corner of SR 76 and Palomar Mountain Road was determined to be the place in the county with the most motorcycle accidents.\n\nConstruction started on widening SR 76 between Melrose Drive and South Mission Road in January 2010 to four lanes, funded by the federal and state governments and by TransNet revenue. The project included building a second bridge over the San Luis Rey River. Discussion on whether the route of the highway should go south or north of the river east of Mission Road began later that year, with residents expressing concerns about being able to make left turns. In June 2011, Caltrans decided to use the existing roadway as the path, but agreed to build traffic signals at Via Monserate, South Mission Road, Gird Road, and Old Highway 395. For environmental mitigation, Caltrans purchased the parcel known as Rancho Lilac, which was . The second Bonsall bridge was finished by April 2012. The westbound lanes between Melrose Drive and Mission Road opened to traffic in October, with the entire roadway projected to be complete by the end of the year. The total cost of the entire widening project east of Melrose Drive is projected to be $371 million.\n\nA request by the city of Oceanside to restore access to Jefferies Ranch Road from SR 76 was declined by Caltrans in late 2012, due to concerns about future expressway expansion to six lanes. In May 2013, construction at the I-15 and SR 76 interchange uncovered a \"Bison latifrons\" fossil. Revisions to the interchange were finished in August 2013. The final portion east to I-15 was contracted out in August, and construction was to begin soon afterward and extend until 2017, at a cost of $201 million. In August 2016, traffic was to switch from the existing roadway to the newly constructed one west of I-15, from Gird Road to Old Highway 395. This would allow the older roadway to be reconfigured to carry westbound traffic, while the new roadway would handle eastbound traffic. The new roadway was described as having fewer turns than the older road, which would increase safety. The expansion of the road to four lanes was completed in May 2017; this meant that from about east of the interchange with I-15 west to CR S21 the roadway was four lanes wide, including the widening that had been paid for by the owners of a rock quarry.\n\n"}

Its purpose is to harmonize state laws concerning retention of paper records (especially checks) and the validity of electronic signatures.\n\nThe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has worked for the uniformity of state laws since 1892. It is a non-profit unincorporated association, composed of state commissions on uniform laws from each state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Obviously, keeping these checks in electronic form only would vastly simplify storage and access concerns for banks. UETA aims to rectify this by streamlining and unifying these laws to allow for electronic retention.

{"id": "1818594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818594", "title": "WDC 65C02", "text": "WDC 65C02\n\nThe Western Design Center (WDC) 65C02 microprocessor is an enhanced CMOS version of the popular nMOS-based 8-bit MOS Technology 6502. The 65C02 fixed several problems in the original 6502 and added some new instructions. However, its main feature was greatly lowered power usage, on the order of 10 to 20 times less than the NMOS 6502 running at the same speed. The reduced power consumption made the 65C02 useful in portable computer roles and microcontroller systems in industrial settings. It has been used in some home computers, as well as in embedded applications, including medical-grade implanted devices.\n\nDevelopment began in 1981 and samples were released in early 1983. WDC licensed the design to Synertek, NCR, GTE, and Rockwell Semiconductor. Rockwell's primary interest was in the embedded market and asked for several new commands to be added to aid in this role. These were later copied back into the baseline version, at which point WDC added two new commands of their own to create the W65C02. Sanyo later licensed the design as well, and Seiko Epson produced a further modified version as the HuC6280.\n\nEarly versions used 40-pin DIP packaging, and were available in 1, 2 and 4 MHz versions. Later versions were produced in PLCC and QFP packages, as well as PDIP, and with much higher clock speed ratings. The current version from WDC, the W65C02S-14 has a fully static core and officially runs at speeds up to 14 MHz when powered at 5 volts.\n\nThe 65C02 is a low cost, general-purpose 8-bit microprocessor (8-bit registers and data bus) with a 16-bit program counter and address bus. The register set is small, with a single 8-bit accumulator (A), two 8-bit index registers (X and Y), an 8-bit status register (P), and a 16-bit program counter (PC). In addition to the single accumulator, the first 256 bytes of RAM, the \"zero page\" (codice_1 to codice_2), allow faster access through addressing modes that use an 8-bit memory address instead of a 16-bit address. The stack lies in the next 256 bytes, page one ($0100 to $01FF), and cannot be moved or extended. The stack grows downwards with the stack pointer (S) starting at $01FF and decrementing as the stack grows. It has a variable-length instruction set, varying between one and three bytes per instruction.\n\nThe basic architecture of the 65C02 is identical to the original 6502, and can be considered a low-power implementation of that design. At 1 MHz, the most popular speed for the original 6502, the 65C02 requires only 20 mW, while the original uses 450 mW, a reduction of over twenty times. The manually optimized core and low power use is intended to make the 65C02 well suited for low power system-on-chip (SoC) designs.\n\nA Verilog hardware description model is available for designing the W65C02S core into an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). As is common in the semiconductor industry, WDC offers a development system, which includes a developer board, an in-circuit emulator (ICE) and a software development system.\n\nThe W65C02S–14 is the production version , and is available in PDIP, PLCC and QFP packages. The maximum officially supported Ø2 (primary) clock speed is 14 MHz when operated at 5 volts, indicated by the –14 part number suffix (hobbyists have developed 65C02 homebrew systems that run faster than the official rating). The \"S\" designation indicates that the part has a fully static core, a feature that allows Ø2 to be slowed down or fully stopped in either the high or low state with no loss of data. Typical microprocessors not implemented in CMOS have dynamic cores and will lose their internal register contents (and thus crash) if they are not continuously clocked at a rate between some minimum and maximum specified values.\n\n\n\nThe W65C02S may be operated at any convenient supply voltage (V) between 1.8 and 5 volts (±5%). The data sheet AC characteristics table lists operational characteristics at 5 V at 14 MHz, 3.3 V or 3 V at 8 MHz, 2.5 V at 4 MHz, and 1.8 V at 2 MHz. This information may be an artifact of an earlier data sheet, as a graph indicates that typical devices are capable of operation at higher speeds than suggested by the AC characteristics table, and that reliable operation at 20 MHz should be readily attainable with V at 5 volts, assuming the supporting hardware will allow it.\n\nThe W65C02S support for arbitrary clock rates allows it to use a clock that runs at a rate ideal for some other part of the system, such as 13.5 MHz (digital SDTV luma sampling rate), 14.31818 MHz (NTSC colour carrier frequency × 4), 14.75 MHz (PAL square pixels), 14.7456 (baud rate crystal), etc., as long as V is sufficient to support the frequency. Designer Bill Mensch has pointed out that F is affected by off-chip factors, such as the capacitive load on the microprocessor's pins. Minimizing load by using short signal tracks and fewest devices helps raise F. The PLCC and QFP packages have less pin-to-pin capacitance than the PDIP package, and are more economical in the use of printed circuit board space.\n\nWDC has reported that FPGA realizations of the W65C02S have been successfully operated at 200 MHz.\n\nAlthough the 65C02 can mostly be thought of as a low-power 6502, it also fixes several bugs found in the original and adds new instructions, addressing modes and features that can assist the programmer in writing smaller and faster-executing programs. It is estimated that the average 6502 assembly language program can be made 10 to 15 percent smaller on the 65C02 and see a similar improvement in performance, largely through avoided memory accesses, as well as use of fewer instructions to accomplish a given task.\n\nThe original 6502 had 56 instructions, which, when combined with different addressing modes, produced a total of 151 opcodes of the possible 256 8-bit patterns. The remaining 105 unused opcodes were undefined, with the set of codes with low-order 4-bits with 3, 7, B or F left entirely unused, the 2 having only a single opcode.\n\nThe 6502 was famous for the way that some of these leftover codes actually performed actions. Due to the way the 6502's instruction decoder worked, simply setting certain bits in the opcode would cause parts of the instruction processing to take place. Some of these opcodes would immediately crash the processor, while other performed useful functions and were even given unofficial assembler mnemonics by users.\n\nThe 65C02 added a number of new opcodes that used up a number of these previously \"undocumented instruction\" slots, for instance, $FF was now used for the new codice_7 instruction (see below). Those that remained truly unused were set to perform codice_8s. Programs that took advantage of these codes will not work on the 65C02, but these codes were always documented as non-operational and should not have been used.\n\nThe original 6502 had several errata when initially launched. Early versions of the processor had a defective codice_9 (rotate right) instruction, which issue MOS Technology addressed by not documenting the instruction. codice_9 was fixed very early in the production run and was not an issue for the vast majority of machines using the processor.\n\nIn contrast, a notorious bug that is present in all NMOS variants of the 6502 involves the jump instruction (codice_11) when using indirect addressing. In this addressing mode, the target address of the codice_11 instruction is fetched from memory (the jump vector), rather than being an operand to the codice_11 instruction. For example, codice_14 would fetch the value in memory locations $1234 (least significant byte) and $1235 (most significant byte) and load those values into the program counter, which would then cause the processor to continue execution at the address stored in the jump vector.\n\nThe bug appears when the vector address ends in $FF, which is the boundary of a memory page. In this case, codice_11 will fetch the most significant byte of the target address from $00 of the original page rather than $00 of the new page. Hence codice_16 would get the least significant byte of the target address at $12FF and the most significant byte of the target address from $1200 rather than $1300. The 65C02 corrected this issue.\n\nMore of an oversight than a bug, the state of the (D)ecimal flag in the NMOS 6502's status register is undefined after a reset or interrupt. This means programmers have to set the flag to a known value in order to avoid any bugs related to arithmetic operations. As a result, one finds a codice_17 instruction (CLear Decimal) in almost all 6502 interrupt handlers, as well as early in the reset code. The 65C02 automatically clears this flag after pushing the status register onto the stack in response any interrupt or in response to a hardware reset, thus placing the processor back into binary arithmetic mode.\n\nDuring decimal mode arithmetic, the NMOS 6502 will update the (N)egative, o(V)erflow and (Z)ero flags to reflect the result of binary arithmetic, that is, the flags are reflecting a result computed prior to the processor performing decimal correction. In contrast, the 65C02 sets these flags according to the result of decimal arithmetic, at the cost of an extra clock cycle per arithmetic instruction.\n\nWhen executing a read-modify-write (R-M-W) instruction, such as codice_18, all NMOS variants will do a double write on \"addr\", first rewriting the current value found at \"addr\" and then writing the modified value. This behavior can result in difficult-to-resolve bugs if \"addr\" is a hardware register. The 65C02 instead performs a double read of \"addr\", followed by a single write.\n\nWhen performing indexed addressing, if indexing crosses a page bounday all NMOS variants will read from an invalid address before accessing the correct address. As with an R-M-W instruction, this behavior can cause problems when accessing hardware registers via indexing. The 65C02 fixed this problem by performing a dummy read of the instruction opcode when indexing crosses a page boundary. However, this fix introduced a new bug that occurs when the base address is on an even page boundary (which means indexing will never cross into the next page). With the new bug, a dummy read is performed on the base address prior to indexing, such that codice_19 will do a dummy read on $1200 prior to the value of X being added to $1200. Again, if indexing on hardware register addresses, this bug can result in undefined behavior.\n\nIf an NMOS 6502 is fetching a BRK (software interrupt) opcode at the same time a hardware interrupt occurs BRK will be ignored as the processor reacts to the interrupt. The 65C02 correctly handles this situation by servicing the interrupt and then executing BRK.\n\nThe 6502 has two indirect addressing modes which dereference through 16-bit addresses stored in page zero:\nA downside of this model is that if indexing is not needed, one of the index registers must still be set to zero and used in one of these instructions. The 65C02 added a non-indexed indirect addressing mode codice_22 to all instructions that used indexed indirect and indirect indexed modes, freeing up the index registers.\n\nThe 6502's instruction had a unique (among 6502 instructions) addressing mode known as \"absolute indirect\" that read a 16-bit value from a given memory address and then jumped to the address in that 16-bit value. For instance, if memory location $A000 holds $34 and $A001 holds $12, codice_23 would read those two bytes, construct the value $1234, and then jump to that location.\n\nOne common use for indirect addressing is to build branch tables, a list of entry points for subroutines that can be accessed using an index. For instance, a device driver might list the entry points for , , , etc in a table at $A000. To access the function, one would use something similar to codice_24, as it is the 3rd entry in the table (index 2) and each entry is 16-bits. If the driver is updated and the subroutine code moves in memory, any existing code will still work as long as it uses the table to look them up.\n\nThe 65C02 added the new \"indexed absolute indirect\" mode which eased the use of branch tables. This mode added the value of the X register to the absolute address and took the 16-bit address from the resulting location. For instance, to access the function from the table above, one would store 4 in X, then codice_25. This style of access makes accessing branch tables simpler as a single base address is used in conjunction with an 8-bit offset.\n\nIn addition to the new addressing modes, the \"base model\" 65C02 also added a set of new instructions.\n\n\nBoth WDC and Rockwell contributed improvements to the bit testing and manipulation functions in the 65C02. WDC added new addressing modes to the BIT instruction that was present in the 6502, as well two new instructions for convenient manipulation of bit fields, a common activity in device drivers.\n\nBIT in the 65C02 adds immediate mode, zero page indexed by X and absolute indexed by X addressing. Immediate mode addressing is particularly convenient in that it is completely non-destructive. For example:\nmay be used in place of:\nThe former preserves the value loaded from \"<register>\" so more than one test can be performed on it. The latter sequence is destructive to the register value.\n\nIn addition to the enhancements of the BIT instruction, WDC added two instructions designed to conveniently manipulate bit fields:\n\n\nRockwell's changes added more bit manipulation instructions for directly setting and testing any bit, and combining the test, clear and branch into a single opcode. The new instructions were available from the start in Rockwell's R65C00 family, but was not part of the original 65C02 specification and not found in versions made by WDC or its other licensees. These were later copied back into the baseline design, and were available in later WDC versions.\n\nRockwell-specific instructions are:\n\n\n\nIn addition to the new commands above, WDC also added the codice_6 and codice_5 instructions for supporting low-power modes.\n\n, STop the Processor, halted all processing until a hardware reset was issued. This could be used to put a system to \"sleep\" and then rapidly wake it with a reset. However, this required some external system to maintain memory, and it was not widely used.\n\nt had a similar effect, entering low-power mode, but this instruction woke the processor up again on the reception of an interrupt. Previously, handling an interrupt generally involved running a loop to check if an interrupt has been received, sometimes known as \"spinning\", checking the type when one is received, and then jumping to the processing code. This meant the processor was running during the entire process.\n\nIn contrast, in the 65C02, interrupt code could be written by having a followed immediately by a or to the handler. When the was encountered, processing stopped and the processor went into low-power mode. When the interrupt was received, it immediately processed the and handled the request.\n\nThis had the added advantage of slightly improving performance. In the spinning case, the interrupt might arrive in the middle of one of the loop's instructions, and to allow it to restart after returning from the handler, the processor spends one cycle to save its location. With , the processor enters the low-power state in a known location where all instructions are guaranteed to be complete, so when the interrupt arrives it cannot possibly interrupt an instruction, and the processor can safely continue without spending a cycle saving state.\n\nThe 65SC02 is a variant of the WDC 65C02 \"without\" bit instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote over 2,000 songs; his works include \"Bruce\", \"I See the World Through Your Eyes\", \"Back on the Town\" and \"Mary's Bar\". For over 50 years he played and sang a catalogue of original songs at nightspots around New York City. He is also known for his sophisticated takes on the songs of Irving Berlin.\n\nWallowitch was born in the Methodist Hospital in South Philadelphia. He attended Edgar Allan Poe Elementary School, Vare Junior High School, Central High School and Temple University in Philadelphia. Wallowitch spent his youth in a desolate neighborhood in South Philadelphia, dreaming about moving to New York. He finally arrived there in his late teens to study classical piano at Juilliard. In order to survive, he played rehearsal piano for shows, among them Leonard Sillman's \"New Faces of '52\", and began to play at the Duplex, a Greenwich Village saloon.\n\nHis first professional appearance was on the Lithuanian Furniture Company Radio Hour (Station WHAT) on which he rendered Irving Berlin's \"So Help Me.\"\n\nWrote Stephen Holden in \"The New York Times\": \"While Noël Coward is no longer around to set the standards for a certain kind of sophisticated songwriting sensibility, Mr. Wallowitch nimbly carries the torch.\" He displays his predilection for Coward-like wit and satire on such songs as \"Cosmetic Surgery\", in which he sums up the surgical predilections of friends who are \"getting younger than ever\" with such dexterity.\n\n<poem>\nIn a matter of weeks\nWith the modern techniques\nFor improving physiques\nThey have altered their beaks\nAnd they've lifted their cheeks\nAnd now everyone speaks\nIn society's cliques\nOf the changes that science has wrought\nOf the changes that money has bought!\n</poem>\n\nHe often wrote about growing up in Philadelphia, and of life with his family. \"I See the World Through Your Eyes\" is a remembrance of Wallowitch's late brother, photographer Edward Wallowitch, close associate of Andy Warhol. \"Manhattan, You're A Dream\" pays tribute to Wallowitch's mother.\n\nDuring the 1960s he met three women who would become his greatest champions: singer-pianist Blossom Dearie for whom Wallowitch's song \"Bruce\" was a favorite standard; Dixie Carter of \"Designing Women\" who recorded a collection of Wallowitch songs in 1984; and Joanne Beretta. Wallowitch's compositions have also been recorded by Shirley Horn, Tony Bennett, Berri Blair, John Dubois, Marlene VerPlanck, Lynn Lobban, and many others. Among the many fine performers who sing his songs are Lynn Lobban, Alice Levine, Eric Comstock, Yvonne Sherwell, Sue Gandy, Joanne Beretta and Michael Belliveau.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Wallowitch was part of a popular cabaret act with his longtime partner, Bertram Ross. The pair sang in nightspots ranging from London's Pizza on the Park to the Ballroom in New York City. A CD of their performance cabaret, \"Wallowitch and Ross\" (Miranda Music) was released in 2003 to supplement the documentary film of the couple, .\n\nAs a solo cabaret entertainer, Wallowitch performed throughout the world and was famous for his long-running hit revue, \"The World of Wallowitch\". He was the recipient of both the MAC and Bistro Awards for Composer of the Year.\n\nWallowitch performed and recorded the song \"Hillary Oh Hillary,\" for Hillary Clinton during her run for U.S. Senate. Henry and Bobbie Shaffner, veteran members of ASCAP, wrote the lyrics and set them to the tune of the old Groucho Marx song, \"Lydia, the Tattooed Lady\". Wallowitch and the Shaffners were inspired to write it after Clinton's six-hour-long visit to Wallowitch's New York studio, where he performed for the former first lady. Later, he translated the Shaffner's lyrics to Yiddish, to create a version called \"Hillary, Oy! Hillary!\"\n\nJohn Wallowitch lived and performed in New York City with his longtime partner Bertram Ross, until Ross's death on Apr 20, 2003.\n\nWallowitch died on August 15, 2007 in New York City. Wallowitch is buried beside Ross at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.\n\nIn 2016, was entered into the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences film archive for permanent preservation.\n\n\n\n"}

She was educated principally at Hamburg, visited Spain in 1815, and in 1816 married Antonio Planells y Bardaxi, an infantry captain of bad character. In the following year Planells was killed in action, and in 1822 the young widow married Francisco Ruiz del Arco, Marqués de Arco Hermoso, an officer in one of the Spanish household regiments.\n\nUpon the death of Arco Hermoso in 1835, the marquesa found herself in straitened circumstances, and in less than two years she married Antonio Arrom de Ayala, a man considerably her junior. Arrom was appointed consul in Australia, engaged in business enterprises and made money; but unfortunate speculations drove him to commit suicide in 1859. Ten years earlier the name of Fernán Caballero became famous in Spain as the author of \"La Gaviota\". The writer had already published in German an anonymous romance, \"Sole\" (1840), and curiously enough the original draft of \"La Gaviota\" was written in French. This novel, translated into Spanish by , appeared as the feuilleton of \"El Heraldo\" (1849), and was received with marked favor. Eugenio de Ochoa, a prominent critic of the day, ratified the popular judgment, and hopefully proclaimed the writer to be a rival of Walter Scott. No other Spanish book of the 19th century has obtained such instant and universal recognition. Translated into most European languages, it is the best of its author's works, with the possible exception of \"La Familia de Alvareda\" (which was written, first of all, in German).\n\nLess successful attempts are \"Lady Virginia\" and \"Clemencia\"; but the short stories entitled \"Cuadros de Costumbres\" are interesting in matter and form, and \"Una en otra\" and \"Elia o la Espana treinta años ha\" are excellent specimens of picturesque narration. It would be difficult to maintain that Fernán Caballero was a great literary artist, but it is certain that she was a born teller of stories and that she has a graceful style very suitable to her purpose. She came into Spain at a most happy moment, before the new order had perceptibly disturbed the old, and she brought to bear not alone a fine natural gift of observation, but a freshness of vision, undulled by long familiarity. She combined the advantages of being both a foreigner and a native.\n\nIn later publications she insisted too emphatically upon the moral lesson, and lost much of her primitive simplicity and charm; but we may believe her statement that, though she occasionally idealized circumstances, she was conscientious in choosing for her themes subjects which had occurred in her own experience. Hence she may be regarded as a pioneer in the realistic field, and this historical fact adds to her positive importance. For many years she was the most popular of Spanish writers, and the sensation caused by her death at Seville on 7 April 1877 proved that her truthfulness still attracted readers who were interested in records of national customs and manners.\n\nHer \"Obras completas\" are included in the \"Colección de escritores castellanos\": a useful biography by Fernando de Gabriel Ruiz de Apodaca precedes the \"Últimas producciones de Fernán Caballero\" (Seville, 1878).\n\n\n"}

He is usually depicted as a criminal who uses sports-themed weapons and gadgets to commit crimes.\n\nCrock is played by Neil Hopkins in the television series \"Stargirl\" for DC Universe and The CW network.\n\nThe Lawrence Crock version of Sportsmaster first appeared in \"All-American Comics\" #85 (May 1947) and was created by writer John Broome and artist Irwin Hasen.\n\nThe Victor Gover version of Sportsmaster first appeared in \"Manhunter\" #17 and was created by John Ostrander, Doug Rice, and Kim Yale.\n\nHe was the foe of the original Green Lantern as well as Wildcat. He was first known as Crusher Crock, a frustrated athlete who turns to a life of crime. He was a member of different incarnations of the Injustice Society. He helped capture the JSA using an exploding ball, after which they were hypnotized and then during the Patriotic Crimes he steals Old Ironside. He teams up with (and later marries) the Golden Age villainess Huntress. Later they have a child named Artemis Crock who became the third Tigress. In his later years he spent time behind bars but at least on one occasion was broken out of prison by his daughter - then a member of Injustice Unlimited. Following his death, his body was cloned by a secret organization called the Council for their enforcers (they had previously used Manhunter).\n\nIn the Elseworlds miniseries \"The Golden Age\", set outside regular DC Comics continuity, Sportsmaster's real name was revealed to be Lawrence Crock. he first appears in issue #2, robbing a jewelry store in the same building as the GBS radio station. He battles Alan Scott in a physical fight. According to the mini-series, he had a daughter he could not see and was hoping to earn enough money committing robberies to win her back. Later he joins the forces of Tex Thompson (secretly Ultra-Humanite in Thompson's body). He dies trying to save a little girl from being killed by Dynaman. His death convinces Alan Scott to join the fight.\n\nThe Earth-One version of the character (see DC Comics Multiverse) had the same name and origin, but was the foe of Robin and Batgirl. He also married his universe's version of the Huntress. After losing a villains versus heroes baseball game, they reformed and have not been seen since. Since the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", this version was apparently wiped from existence or merged with his Earth-2 counterpart.\n\nThere was also another Sportsmaster whose identity was Victor Gover, a former African-American football player who possessed \"photographic reflexes.\" Blacklisted from the world of professional sports after his meta-human abilities were revealed, he turned to crime with a special armored suit that he wore. He fought against Manhunter and later became a member of the Suicide Squad for one mission during War of the Gods. They are sent on an intelligence-gathering mission against the magic-user Circe. The Sportsmaster's allies included Black Adam, Javelin, and the author avatar of Grant Morrison. Sportsmaster was one of the few members to survive this mission.\n\nFollowing the events of Zero Hour, the character of Victor Gover was radically altered. Victor Gover was now a white male with blonde hair, who no longer had photographic reflex powers, but was a disgraced all-American athlete who turned to crime due to an addiction to gambling. Furthermore, he also wore an exact replica of the original Sportsmaster's costume. Fighting Wildcat, Victor was betting on himself as part of a betting parlor based on metahuman fights. Gover then fought against a handicapped JSA, who were taking a dive to ensure the kidnapped Ma Hunkel's safety. After Wildcat freed Ma Hunkel, the JSA quickly routed him. Wildcat then took Gover to the alley where the whole incident began, beat Gover savagely, and forced Gover to retire as a supervillain and attend Gamblers Anonymous.\n\nThere were two individuals who modeled their modus operandi after the Sportsmaster, the Sportsman of Earth-2 and the Sportsman of Earth-1.\n\nThe Earth-2 version gained his powers from absorption of an anti-proton globe which enhanced his physical attributes and allowed him to wield seemingly telekinetic control of various sports related implements. This version embarked on a life of crime as a result of the globe's effect on the rational functions of his cerebral cortex. He battled several heroes including the Golden Age Robin and Wildcat.\n\nThe Earth-1 version was Martin Mantle, Jr. and appeared only in \"Batman\" #338 (1981). During Mantle's youth, his father, disgusted by his son's poor athletic performance, forcibly subjected him to unsafe enhancement treatment in a twisted attempt to make him more \"manly.\" Although emotionally scarred by the incident, Mantle indeed grew up to become a champion athlete, only to learn his father's procedure was altering his body in a way that would eventually kill him. As the Sportsman, he embarked on a brief life of crime with Olympian-level physical attributes and specialized equipment of his own design. His adversary was the Silver Age Batman who allowed him to \"win\" once he became aware that Mantle's life was nearing its end.\n\nA Sportsmaster appears as one of General Immortus' followers in \"Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!\". His real name, origin, and any connection to Crock is not revealed. He is killed in an explosion. His look is modeled on the Earth-One Sportsman.\n\nIn \"The New 52\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), a character named 'Mad Dog' appears in \"Suicide Squad #3\". His appearance is based on the Lawrence Crock version of Sportsmaster that appeared in \"Young Justice\".\n\nThe Lawrence Crock version of Sportsmaster appears as a member of Leviathan. He is also mentioned to be the roommate of Clock King, and the two fight Harley Quinn.\n\nCrock uses sporting-themed weapons such as exploding baseballs, flying bases, rocket baseball bats, knockout basketballs, lacrosse snare nets, exploding hockey pucks. Their outfits generally included a baseball cap, catcher's mask, padded jersey, catcher's chestguard, football-style pants, and cleats.\n\nEach of the Sportsmasters and Sportsmen had superb physical attributes on par with Olympic athletes in their prime. As noted above, Victor Gover also had \"photographic reflexes\".\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Sportsmaster is imprisoned in Doom prison. During the prison break, Sportsmaster was forced by Heat Wave and Eel O'Brian attempt to breakout from cells. Sportsmaster's heart is torn out by Eel O'Brian.\n\n\n\nSportsmaster appears as a boss in the video game \"\", voiced by Nick Chinlund. During the game's first mission, Sportsmaster is tasked with securing a piece of an ancient statue for The Light in a Greek museum. He encounters Artemis and the Team, teasing her to leave the heroes before a fight. Sportsmaster manages to escape, leaving to Verhoyansk to assist Icicle Jr. in securing another piece. He and Icicle are defeated by Superboy and a squad of heroes after a tag-team battle.\n\nIn \"The Batman Adventures\" comic #5–8 (October 2003 – January 2004)(set in the DC Animated Universe), Sportsmaster appeared as one of Black Mask's lieutenants.\n"}

However, Oshakan is best known for the Saint Mesrop Mashtots Cathedral which is the burial place of Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the creator of the Armenian alphabet. The church houses his grave and was rebuilt by Catholicos George IV in 1875. Wall paintings on the interior were done in 1960 by the artist H. Minasian. Saint Mesrop Cathedral is the seat of the Aragatsotn Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\n\nJust to the south of the town is the Didikond Hill, where excavations have uncovered a fort and five palaces built around the 7th to 5th centuries BC.\n\nTo the north of town located in the Mankanots Valley is Saint Sion Church dating from the 7th century AD.

After a while, Pac-Man succeeded in trapping all the ghosts into one book, which was then promptly locked.

The game was debuted at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2004 as a technology demonstration for the newly unveiled Nintendo DS hardware. According to producer Hideo Yoshizawa, \"Pac-Pix\" was conceived as an arcade game by director Tetsuya Shinoda four years prior. Using Apple personal digital assistants (PDAs), Shinoda noticed how corrected text would disappear with a tiny puff of smoke when crossed out by the user; he found this type of control intuitive and wanted to implement it into a game. Two years later, the creators pitched the idea as a tablet computer and PDA game, but found the game and the target audience for such hardware did not match. When the DS was announced, Yoshizawa stated that \"the time was right\". The E3 demo \"Pac-Pix\" was met with praise from people within the video game industry, many of which requested it be made into a full game. Namco obliged by putting together a development team, which implemented more effective use of the hardware's two screens. According to Yoshizawa, the most difficult aspect of production on \"Pac-Pix\" was allowing the player to determine size, shape, and place of their own sketches within the gameplay environment.\n\n\n"}

He renounced the combined title of Duke of Maestrazgo with its annual stipend in favour of the less fortunate and kept both nobility titles instead.\n\nHe was born at Tortosa, province of Tarragona, Spain. As his family had in their gift two chaplaincies, young Cabrera was sent to the seminary of Tortosa, where he made himself conspicuous as an unruly pupil, ever mixed up in disturbances and careless in his studies. After he had taken minor orders, the bishop refused to ordain him as a priest, telling him that the Church was not his vocation, and that everything in him showed that he ought to be a soldier. Cabrera followed this advice and took part in Carlist conspiracies on the death of Ferdinand VII of Spain. The authorities exiled him and he absconded to Morella to join the forces of the pretender Don Carlos.\n\nIn this First Carlist War (1833–1839) he rose in a very short time by sheer daring, fanaticism and ferocity to the front rank among the Carlist chiefs who led the bands of Don Carlos in Catalonia, Aragon and Valencia. He raised his own army travelling from village to village. As a raider he was often successful, and he was many times wounded in the brilliant fights in which he again and again defeated the generals of Queen Isabella, such as at the Battle of Maella.\n\nWhen Marshal Espartero induced the Carlists of the north-western provinces, with Maroto at their head, to submit in accordance with the Convention of Vergara, which secured the recognition of the rank and titles of 1000 Carlist officers, Cabrera held out in Central Spain for nearly a year. Marshals Espartero and O'Donnell, with the bulk of the Isabellino armies, had to conduct a long and bloody campaign against Cabrera before they succeeded in driving him into French territory in July 1840. The government of Louis Philippe kept him in a fortress for some months and then allowed him to go to England, where he quarrelled with the pretender, disapproving of his abdication in favor of the count of Montemolin.\n\nIn 1848 Cabrera reappeared in the mountains of Catalonia at the head of Carlist bands. These were soon dispersed and he again fled to France. After this last effort he did not take a very active part in the propaganda and subsequent risings of the Carlists, who, however, continued to consult him. He took offence when new men, not a few of them quondam regular officers, became the advisers and lieutenants of Don Carlos in the Third Carlist War which lasted more or less from 1870–1876. Indeed, his long residence in England, his marriage with Miss Richards, and his prolonged absence from Spain had much shaken his devotion to his old cause and belief in its success.\n\nIn March 1875 Cabrera sprang upon Don Carlos a manifesto in which he called upon the adherents of the pretender to follow his own example and submit to the restored monarchy of Alphonso XII, the son of Queen Isabella, who recognized the rank of captain-general and the title of count of Morella conferred on Cabrera by the first pretender. His decision was tempered by his growing belief of the futility of a protracted civil war. Only a very few insignificant Carlists followed Cabrera's example, and Don Carlos issued a proclamation declaring him a traitor and depriving him of all his honours and titles.\n\nThe Carlist cause never recovered as a political force from the sole decision of Cabrera, captain-general and formerly the recognised leader of all Carlist forces in defining battlefield victories, to bring a bloody civil war to a definitive end. The Duke of Wellington and contemporary accredited Cabrera as a noteworthy guerrilla leader.\n\nCabrera, who was ever afterwards regarded with contempt and execration by the Carlists, died in London on 24 May 1877. He did not receive much attention from the majority of his fellow-countrymen, who commonly said that his disloyalty to his old cause had proved more harmful to him than beneficial to the new state of things. A pension which had been granted to his widow was renounced by her in 1899 in aid of the Spanish treasury after the loss of the colonies.\n\nHis tomb, which has Listed Building Grade 2 status, is in a railed-off section of Christ Church churchyard, Virginia Water, Surrey, England. His devoted wife and dedicated conservationist, Marianne née Vaughn-Richards, who survived him by 35 years, is buried alongside him. The marriage bore four children.\n\n"}
