The Red Sox finished second in the American League East with a record of 95 wins and 67 losses, the same record as the New York Yankees. The Yankees were deemed the division winner, due to their 10–9 head-to-head record against the Red Sox during the regular season. The Red Sox qualified for the postseason as the AL wild card, but were swept by the American League Central champion Chicago White Sox in the ALDS.\n\nOn offense, the Red Sox led Major League Baseball in runs scored (910), hits (1,579), doubles (339), RBI (863), walks (653), batting average (.281), OBP (.357), OPS (.811) and sacrifice flies (63). Red Sox pitchers hit opposing batters with 89 pitches, the most by any major league pitching staff in 2005.\n\nThe Red Sox made a few notable offseason moves coming off their 2004 World Series championship. The team brought back Jason Varitek by re-signing the veteran catcher to a 4-year $40 million deal. Outfielder Dave Roberts – who played a key role as a base stealer during the 2004 postseason – was traded to the Padres in exchange for shortstop Ramon Vazquez and left fielder Jay Payton.\n\nManagement sought to fill the void left by Orlando Cabrera and Pokey Reese at shortstop by signing free agent Édgar Rentería to a 4-year $40 million year with a 5th year option. The move sat well with fans because Rentería was coming off a very successful 2004 campaign with the St. Louis Cardinals. Rentería hit .287 with 10 homeruns and 72 RBI in 2004.\n\nThe Red Sox front office looked to bolster their starting pitching by signing two veteran pitchers. The need for starting pitching was a point of emphasize due to the departure of Pedro Martínez to the New York Mets after 7 years in a Red Sox uniform. The first pitcher signed was former Padres starter David Wells. Wells was coming off a surprising 2004 season with the Padres in which he posted a 3.73 ERA over 195 innings pitched at the age of 41. The second pitcher signed was former Cubs starter Matt Clement. Clement was coming off a season in which he posted a respectable 3.68 ERA over 181 innings pitched.\n\n\n\"Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\"\n\"Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\"\n\n\"Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ER = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\"\n\"Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\"\n\"Note: G = Games pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; SV = Saves; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\"\nThe Chicago White Sox swept the Red Sox in the American League Division Series. The White Sox went on to win the World Series that year against the Houston Astros. The Red Sox were forced to play in the 2005 Postseason as a wild card team even though they had the same regular season record as their interdivision rival the New York Yankees. That is due to the fact that the Yankees had won the regular season head to head matchups versus the Red Sox 10-9.\n\nA crucial moment of the series came in game 2 when Red Sox second baseman Tony Graffanino made a crucial error that led to the White Sox scoring three unearned runs in the fifth inning. A slow groundball hit to the right side of the infield was able to get past Graffanino and a key double play was not turned. Later in the inning, White Sox second baseman Tadahito Iguchi hit a three-run homerun to give the White Sox a one-run lead. Red Sox pitcher David Wells was pitching well in the game until the error. The error is viewed by many fans as having the Red Sox lose Game 2 and eventually the American League Division Series.\n\nRed Sox ace Curt Schilling did not start a game in the American League Division Series after pitching in the last game of the season against the Yankees.\n\n\n\nThe Wilmington Blue Rocks replaced the Sarasota Red Sox as the Class A-Advanced affiliate, and the Greenville Bombers replaced the Augusta GreenJackets as the Class A affiliate.\n\n\n"}

McClellan Jr.'s revocation of moving-picture exhibition licenses on Christmas Eve 1908. The mayor (son of Civil War general George B. McClellan) believed that the new medium degraded the morals of the community. To assert their freedom of expression, theatre owners led by Marcus Loew and film distributors (Edison, Biograph, Pathé, and Gaumont) joined John Collier of the People's Institute at Cooper Union and established the New York Board of Motion Picture Censorship, which soon changed its name to the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures to avoid the word \"censorship\".\n\nThe Board's stated purpose was to endorse films of merit and champion the new \"art of the people\", which was transforming America's cultural life. In an effort to avoid government censorship of films, the National Board became the unofficial clearinghouse for new movies. From 1916 into the 1950s, thousands of motion pictures carried the legend \"Passed by the National Board of Review\" in their main titles. The board was a de facto censorship organization. Producers submitted their films to the board before making release prints; they agreed to cut any footage that the board found objectionable, up to and including destroying the entire film.\n\nIn 1930, the NBR was the first group to choose the 10 best English-language movies of the year and the best foreign films, and is still the first critical body to announce its annual awards. The NBR has also gained international acclaim for its publications: \"Film Program\" (1917–1926); \"Exceptional Photoplays\" (1920–1925); \"Photoplay Guide to Better Movies\" (1924–1926); \"National Board of Review Magazine\" (1926–1942); \"New Movies\" (1942–1949); and \"Films in Review\", which published its first issue in 1950. Influencing generations of filmmakers and film lovers, these journals have fostered commentary on all aspects of cinema production and history, and contributors have included James Agee, Pearl S. Buck, Alistair Cooke, William K. Everson, Manny Farber, Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang, Harold Robbins, William Saroyan, Dore Schary, and Tennessee Williams.\n\nTo determine the NBR's annual awards, ballots are sent in by over 100 members – a select group of knowledgeable film enthusiasts, academics, and filmmakers in the New York metropolitan area – and subsequently tabulated by a certified public accountancy firm in order to decide the winners. In addition, the Awards Committee determines the special achievement awards presented at the annual gala in January.\n\nThe organization also works to foster commentary on all aspects of film production by underwriting educational film programs and seminars for film students. In 2017, the NBR provided grants to Reel Works Teen Filmmaking, Ghetto Film School, and Educational Video Center. The organization also awarded grants to 13 student filmmakers as part of its annual student grant program.\n\nThe boards's official magazine had existed in several forms and different names since its inception. In 1950, the magazine changed its name from \"Screen Magazine\" and launched the first issue as \"Films in Review\" on February 1, 1950.\n\n\nNote: Until 1945, there were only awards for Best Picture and intermittent awards for Best Documentary and Best Foreign Film.\n\n"}
{"id": "1956179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956179", "title": "Battle of Muye", "text": "Battle of Muye\n\nThe Battle of Muye or Mu () was a battle fought in ancient China between the Zhou and Shang. The Zhou victory led to the Shang being replaced and subsequently justified the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven. The victory of the Zhou led to the fall of the Shang. \n\nBy the 12th century BC, Shang influence extended west to the Wei River valley, a region that was occupied by clans known as the Zhou. King Wen of Zhou, the ruler of the Zhou, who was a Shang vassal, was given the title \"Count of the West\" by the King Di Xin of Shang (King Zhòu). Di Xin used King Wen to guard his rear while he was involved in a south-eastern campaign.\n\nEventually Di Xin, fearing King Wen's growing power, imprisoned him. Although Wen was later released, the tension between Shang and Zhou grew. Wen prepared his army, and conquered a few smaller states which were loyal to Shang, slowly weakening Shang's allies. However, King Wen died in 1050 BC before Zhou's actual offensive against Shang.\n\nDi Xin paid very little attention to these, as he viewed himself as the rightful ruler of China, a position appointed by the heavens, or perhaps because he was becoming engrossed with his personal life with his beautiful consort Daji, to the exclusion of all else.\n\nKing Wen's son King Wu of Zhou led the Zhou in a revolt a few years later. The reason for this delay was because King Wu believed that the \"heavenly order\" to conquer Shang had not been given, as well as the advice of Jiang Ziya to wait for the right opportunity.\n\nChinese civilians greatly supported King Wu's rebellion. In legend, Di Xin, initially, had been a good ruler. But after he married Daji, he became a ruthless ruler. Many called for the end of the Shang dynasty.\n\nWith Jiang Ziya as the strategist, King Wu of Zhou led an army of about 50,000. Di Xin's army was at war in the east, but he still had about 530,00 men to defend the capital city of Yin. But to further secure his victory, he gave weapons to about 170,000 slaves to protect the capital. These slaves did not want to fight for the corrupt Shang dynasty, and defected to the Zhou army instead.\n\nThis event greatly lowered the morale of the Shang troops. When engaged, many Shang soldiers did not fight and held their spears upside down, as a sign that they no longer wanted to fight for the corrupt Shang. Some Shang soldiers joined the Zhou outright.\n\nStill, many loyal Shang troops fought on, and a very bloody battle followed, which is described in the Shijing (poem #236), as translated by James Legge:\n\nThe Zhou troops were much better trained, and their morale was high. In one of the chariot charges, King Wu broke through the Shang's defense line. Di Xin was forced to flee to his palace, and the remaining Shang troops fell into further chaos. The Zhou were victorious and showed little mercy to the defeated Shang, shedding enough blood \"to float a log\".\n\nAfter the battle Di Xin adorned himself with many valuable jewels then lit a fire and burned himself to death in his palace on the Deer Terrace Pavilion. King Wu killed Daji after he found her with the order to execute her given by Jiang Ziya. Shang officials were released without charge with some later working as Zhou officials. The imperial grain store was opened immediately after the battle to feed the starving population. The battle marked the end of the Shang dynasty and the beginning of the Zhou dynasty.\n\n"}

{"id": "1956203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956203", "title": "Kitos War", "text": "Kitos War\n\nThe Kitos War (115–117; : \"mered ha'galuyot\" or \"mered ha'tfutzot\" [מרד התפוצות]; translation: rebellion of the diaspora. ) was one of the major Jewish–Roman wars, 66–136. The rebellions erupted in the year 115, when a majority of the Roman armies were fighting Trajan's Parthian War on the eastern border of the Roman Empire. Major uprisings by ethnic Judeans in Cyrenaica, Cyprus and Egypt spiraled out of control, resulting in a widespread slaughter of left-behind Roman garrisons and Roman citizens by Jewish rebels. \n\nThe Jewish rebellions were finally crushed by Roman legionary forces, chiefly by the Roman general Lusius Quietus, whose nomen later gave the conflict its title, as \"Kitos\" is a later corruption of Quietus. Some were left so utterly annihilated that Romans moved in to settle these areas to prevent their complete depopulation. The Jewish leader, Lukuas, fled to Judea. Marcius Turbo pursued him and sentenced to death the brothers Julian and Pappus, who had been key leaders in the rebellion. Lusius Quietus, the conqueror of the Jews of Mesopotamia, was now in command of the Roman army in Judea, and laid siege to Lydda, where the rebel Jews had gathered under the leadership of Julian and Pappus. Lydda was next taken and many of the rebellious Jews were executed; the \"slain of Lydda\" are often mentioned in words of reverential praise in the Talmud. The rebel leaders Pappus and Julian were among those executed by the Romans in the same year. The situation in Judea remained tense for the Romans, who were obliged under Hadrian to permanently move the Legio VI \"Ferrata\" into Caesarea Maritima in Judea. \n\nTension between the Jewish population of the Roman Empire and the Greek and Roman populations mounted over the course of the 1st century CE, gradually escalating with various violent events, mainly throughout Judea (Iudaea), where parts of the Judean population occasionally erupted into violent insurrections against the Roman Empire. Several incidents also occurred in other parts of the Empire, most notably the Alexandria pogroms, targeting the large Jewish community of Alexandria in the province of Egypt. However, with the exception of Alexandria, the Jewish diaspora fared well throughout the Roman Empire and relied on the Roman state for maintaining their rights.\n\nThe escalation of tensions finally erupted as the First Jewish–Roman War, which began in the year 66 CE. Initial hostilities were due to Greek and Jewish religious tensions, but later escalated due to anti-taxation protests and attacks upon Roman citizens. The Roman military garrison of Judea was quickly overrun by rebels and the pro-Roman king Herod Agrippa II fled Jerusalem, together with Roman officials, to Galilee. Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, brought the Syrian army, based on XII Fulminata, reinforced by auxiliary troops, to restore order and quell the revolt. The legion, however, was ambushed and defeated by Jewish rebels at the Battle of Beth Horon, a result that shocked the Roman leadership.\n\nThe suppression of the revolt was then handed to general Vespasian and his son Titus, who assembled four legions and began advancing through the country, starting with Galilee, in the year 67 CE. The revolt ended when legions under Titus besieged and destroyed the center of rebel resistance in Jerusalem in the year 70 CE and defeated the remaining Jewish strongholds later on.\n\nIn 115, the emperor Trajan was in command of the eastern campaign against the Parthian Empire. The Roman invasion had been prompted by the imposition of a pro-Parthian king on the throne of Armenia after a Parthian invasion of that land.\nThis encroachment on the traditional sphere of influence of the Roman Empire — the two empires had shared hegemony over Armenia since the time of Nero some 50 years earlier — could only lead to war.\n\nAs Trajan's army advanced victoriously through Mesopotamia, Jewish rebels in its rear began attacking the small garrisons left behind. A revolt in far off Cyrenaica soon spread to Egypt and then Cyprus, inciting revolt in Judea. A widespread uprising centered at Lydda threatened grain supplies from Egypt to the front. The Jewish insurrection swiftly spread to the recently conquered provinces. Cities with substantial Jewish populations – Nisibis, Edessa, Seleucia, Arbela (now Erbil, Iraq) – joined the rebellion and slaughtered their small Roman garrisons.\n\nIn Cyrenaica, the rebels were led by one Lukuas or Andreas, who called himself \"king\" (according to Eusebius of Caesarea). His group destroyed many temples, including those to Hecate, Jupiter, Apollo, Artemis and Isis, as well as the civil structures that were symbols of Rome, including the Caesareum, the basilica, and the public baths.\n\nThe 4th century Christian historian Orosius records that the violence so depopulated the province of Cyrenaica that new colonies had to be established by Hadrian:\nThe Jews ... waged war on the inhabitants throughout Libya in the most savage fashion, and to such an extent was the country wasted that, its cultivators having been slain, its land would have remained utterly depopulated, had not the Emperor Hadrian gathered settlers from other places and sent them thither, for the inhabitants had been wiped out.\n\nDio Cassius states of Jewish insurrectionaries: Meanwhile the Jews in the region of Cyrene had put one Andreas at their head and were destroying both the Romans and the Greeks. They would cook their flesh, make belts for themselves of their entrails, anoint themselves with their blood, and wear their skins for clothing. Many they sawed in two, from the head downwards. Others they would give to wild beasts and force still others to fight as gladiators. In all, consequently, two hundred and twenty thousand perished. In Egypt, also, they performed many similar deeds, and in Cyprus under the leadership of Artemio. There, likewise, two hundred and forty thousand perished. For this reason no Jew may set foot in that land, but even if one of them is driven upon the island by force of the wind, he is put to death. Various persons took part in subduing these Jews, one being Lusius, who was sent by Trajan.\n\nThe original 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia cited this about the Cyrene massacres: By this outbreak Libya was depopulated to such an extent that a few years later new colonies had to be established there (Eusebius, \"Chronicle\" from the Armenian, fourteenth year of Hadrian). Bishop Synesius, a native of Cyrene in the beginning of the fifth century, speaks of the devastations wrought by the Jews (\"Do Regno,\" p. 2).\n\nThe Jewish Encyclopedia acknowledges Dio Cassius's importance as a source, though believes his accounts of the actions at Cyrene and on Cyprus may have been embellished: For an account of the Jewish war under Trajan and Hadrian Dion is the most important source (lxviii. 32, lxix. 12–14), though his descriptions of the cruelties perpetrated by the Jews at Cyrene and on the island of Cyprus are probably exaggerated.\n\nLukuas led the rebels toward Alexandria, entered the city, which had been abandoned by the Roman governor, Marcus Rutilius Lupus, and set fire to it. The Egyptian temples and the tomb of Pompey were destroyed. Jewish rebels reportedly also prevailed in a battle at Hermopolis in 116, as indicated in a papyrus.\n\nTrajan sent new troops under the \"praefectus praetorio\" Marcius Turbo, but Egypt and Cyrenaica were pacified only in autumn 117.\n\nIn Cyprus a Jewish band under a leader named Artemion took control of the island, killing tens of thousands of Cypriot Greek civilians. The Cypriot Jews participated in the great uprising against the Romans under Trajan (117), and massacred, according to Dio, 240,000 Greeks. A Roman army was dispatched to the island, soon reconquering the capital. After the revolt had been fully defeated, laws were created forbidding any Jews to live on the island.\n\nA new revolt sprang up in Mesopotamia, while Trajan was in the Persian Gulf. Trajan reconquered Nisibis (Nusaybin in Turkey), Edessa, the capital of Osroene, and Seleucia (Iraq), each of which housed large Jewish communities.\n\nA pro-Roman son of the Parthian king Osroes I, named Parthamaspatas, had been brought on the expedition as part of the emperor's entourage. Trajan had him crowned in Ctesiphon as king of the Parthians. Cassius Dio described the event thus: \"Trajan, fearing that the Parthians, too, might begin a revolt, desired to give them a king of their own. Accordingly, when he came to Ctesiphon, he called together in a great plain all the Romans and likewise all the Parthians that were there at the time; then he mounted a lofty platform, and after describing in grandiloquent language what he had accomplished, he appointed Parthamaspates king over the Parthians and set the diadem upon his head.\" With this done, Trajan moved north to take personal command of the ongoing siege of Hatra.\n\nThe siege continued throughout the summer of 117, but the years of constant campaigning in the baking eastern heat had taken their toll on Trajan, who suffered a heatstroke. He decided to begin the long journey back to Rome in order to recover. Sailing from Seleucia, the emperor's health deteriorated rapidly. He was taken ashore at Selinus in Cilicia, where he died, and his successor, Hadrian, assumed the reins of government shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Jewish leader, Lukuas, fled to Judea. Marcius Turbo pursued him and sentenced to death the brothers Julian and Pappus, who had been key leaders in the rebellion. Lusius Quietus, the conqueror of the Jews of Mesopotamia, was now in command of the Roman army in Judea, and laid siege to Lydda, where the rebel Jews had gathered under the leadership of Julian and Pappus. The distress became so great that the patriarch Rabban Gamaliel II, who was shut up there and died soon afterwards, permitted fasting even on Ḥanukkah. Other rabbis condemned this measure. Lydda was next taken and many of the rebellious Jews were executed; the \"slain of Lydda\" are often mentioned in words of reverential praise in the Talmud. The rebel leaders Pappus and Julian were among those executed by the Romans in the same year.\n\nLusius Quietus, whom the Emperor Trajan had held in high regard and who had served Rome so well, was quietly stripped of his command once Hadrian had secured the Imperial title. He was murdered in unknown circumstances in the summer of 118, possibly by the orders of Hadrian.\n\nHadrian took the unpopular decision to end the war, abandoning much of Trajan's eastern conquests and stabilising the eastern borders. Although he abandoned the erstwhile province of Mesopotamia, he installed Parthamaspates – who had been ejected from Ctesiphon by the returning Osroes – as king of a restored Osroene. For a century Osroene would retain a precarious independence as a buffer state, sandwiched between the two empires.\n\nThe situation in Judea remained tense for the Romans, who were obliged under Hadrian to permanently move the Legio VI \"Ferrata\" into Caesarea Maritima in Judea.\n\nFurther developments occurred in Judea Province in the year 130, when Emperor Hadrian visited the Eastern Mediterranean and, according to Cassius Dio, made the decision to rebuild the ruined city of Jerusalem as the Roman colonia of Aelia Capitolina, derived from his own name. The decision, together with Hadrian's other sanctions against the Jews, was allegedly one of the reasons for the eruption of the 132 Bar Kokhba revolt — an extremely violent uprising, which stretched Roman military resources to the limit. The Bar Kokhba rebellion ended with an unprecedented onslaught of Judean population and a ban upon the Jewish practices, which was lifted only in 138, upon Hadrian's death.\n\n\n"}

The nearest incorporated town is the tourist destination of Helen.\n\nSautee Nacoochee is located at longitude −83.68094, latitude 34.67994.\n\nSautee Nacoochee's name combines two place names of Muscogee origin. \"Sautee\" is the anglicized name of a band of Muscogee Creek Native Americans, known as the Sawate, which means \"Raccoon People.\" \"Nacoochee\" is the anglicization of the Cherokee pronunciation of the Muscogee word, \"Nokose\", which means \"bear.\"\n\nA state historic marker states that the location was visited by Hernando de Soto in 1540 AD. However, a study of the route taken by De Soto by a team of Southeastern university professors in the 1980s placed his route far to the north.\n\nNearby Yonah Mountain is the site of a folktale where a beautiful Cherokee maiden named Nacoochee fell in love with the Chickasaw warrior Sautee. When their love was forbidden by the tribal elders, a war party followed the eloping lovers and threw Sautee off the mountain, with Nacoochee then jumping to her death, a \"Lover's Leap\". Although he did not invent the legend, George Williams, the son of one of the original white settlers, popularized it in his 1871 \"Sketches of Travel in the Old and New World\".\n\nThe \"Sautee Valley Historic District\" (adjacent to the \"Nacoochee Valley Historic District\") is a historic district centered on the community of Sautee Nacoochee. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and has agricultural, architectural, and historic significance. The District includes the location of pre-historic villages and more recent buildings and structures from after American settlers came to the area. Spanish explorers sought gold in this valley, as did settlers who were seeking their fortune in the Georgia Gold Rush. The center point of the Sautee Valley Historic District is the intersection of Georgia State Route 255 and Lynch Mountain Road.\n\nSautee Nacoochee is most noted for the Sautee Nacoochee Center, a cultural and community center housed in the restored Nacoochee schoolhouse.

The Pottery Museum's new facility, designed by Atlanta architect Robert M. Cain, features a main exhibit floor that houses more than 150 vessels on permanent display and has space for additional temporary exhibits.\n\nThe numerous cultural programs at the Sautee Nacoochee Center led to Sautee Nacoochee being designated as one of \"The 100 Best Small Arts Towns in America\" in a book by the same name written by John Villani.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rather than being designed as a realistic interpretation of the sport of football, like \"Madden NFL\" or \"NFL 2K\", the \"Blitz\" series was created as an over-the-top, exaggerated version of the sport, inspired by Midway's own \"NBA Jam\" basketball games.\n\nIn 2005, after losing the NFL license, Midway relaunched the \"Blitz\" series as \"\", depicting fictional players and teams in a fictional league with slightly more realistic (though still exaggerated) on-field play and a focus on the seedy behind-the-scenes lives of the players.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of Midway, EA Sports acquired the rights to the \"Blitz\" name and relaunched the series on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live with a new entry in the series simply titled \"NFL Blitz\". The game took the series back to the original style of \"Blitz\", but removed the late hits due to input by the NFL.\n\nThe \"Blitz\" titles largely follow standard American football rules as outlined by the NFL, but with key differences to encourage faster and more aggressive play. In the original games, seven players are on the field per side (as opposed to eleven). Not only were there fewer players, but positions were flexible at best. Wide receivers could be known to run the ball and sometimes pass, and defensive players were all crosses between pass rushers and defensive backs. 2002 saw an increase to eight players and \"NFL Blitz Pro\" (released in 2003) increased to the full eleven.\n\nUnlike the NFL, pass interference is allowed, as are late hits, showboating and excessive celebrations. There are no timeouts, but the clock stops after every play. Extra point attempts are claimed to be automatic, but there are rare misses. Field goals and Two-point conversions are played out as usual. Quarters have been shortened to two minutes (default setting) with a faster running timer than real time. For most releases, a first down would mean you would have to go 30 yards, instead of ten. Plays such as \"Da Bomb\" allowed for a quarterback to accurately throw the ball most of the length of the field at will and receivers could make impossible catches. On the other side, defensive players were able to leap up and swat (if not intercept) balls no other game could allow for or dive incredible lengths to make a stop.\n\nFrom the beginning, one of the key changes in \"Blitz\" was the animations. Where other games had to keep normal tackling and stops, \"Blitz\" players were able to stop a play in a variety of unique ways. One of the most common was for a defensive player to grab his opponent and spin him around and fling him to the ground, sometimes giving them extra yards in the process. This violent and theatrical style allows the players to execute textbook professional wrestling moves such as the German suplex, elbow drop, and leg drop even after a tackle has been completed and the whistle blown. In addition, the team with the lead often receives kick-offs deeper in its own territory and are more likely to fumble or throw interceptions to help level the gameplay and encourage closer games.\n\nThe NFL, however, made Midway tame most of the more violent or insane aspects of the game as the license progressed. Subsequent releases stripped down \"excessive celebrations\" and late hits until the game was almost one of the sims to which it was originally opposed. However, the game still retained its over-the-top aspects including censored profanity done in a comical manner. Raiden and Shinnok, characters from the \"Mortal Kombat\" series, a series also developed by Midway, were unlockable characters in some versions.\n\nThe game was created by Midway Games and headed by lead artist, Sal DiVita and lead programmer, Mark Turmell.\n\nThe NFL paid little attention to the game's development until just before the launch. Upon watching a preview scrimmage by Turmell and DiVita, league representatives said they could not have the NFL associated with the game as it was then programmed. They said there was too much violence in the game and offered to refund Midway's license fee. Midway was eager to keep the NFL's endorsement of the game, so they compromised on some of the graphic violence and \"late hits\" in the game.\n\nBeginning in 1997, Midway released a new entry in the series each year. However, after the commercial failure of the more simulation-oriented \"Blitz Pro\", Midway did not release a \"Blitz\" in 2004 for the first time since the series began.\n\nAfter losing the NFL license to Electronic Arts, Midway brought back the original \"Blitz\" style play with 2005's \"\". The celebrations and the violent aspects returned and were ramped up to levels that the NFL never allowed. In place of real NFL teams are fictional teams such as the New York Nightmare and the Minnesota Reapers. Although no current NFL players were featured, retired players Lawrence Taylor and Bill Romanowski were hired to lend their voices to and help promote the game. The game contains a significant amount of explicit content not seen in other entries of the series, such as the use of anabolic steroids and \"juicing\" injured players with what seems to be the equivalent of a cortisone shot. \"Blitz: The League\" also introduced an extensive story mode created with the help of one of the writers from ESPN's \"Playmakers\". As a result of the mature themes in the title, \"The League\" is the first and only professional football franchise to ever receive the \"Mature\" rating from the ESRB and was banned in Australia. A sequel, \"\" was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 13, 2008.\n\nAfter Midway's bankruptcy filing in 2009, EA Sports, publisher of the popular NFL simulation series Madden NFL and the exclusive holder of the NFL's video game rights, acquired the rights to the NFL Blitz intellectual property, and on October 19, 2011, EA Sports announced NFL Blitz' return via a story with Electronic Gaming Monthly and the release of an announcement trailer. EA Sports intended the new NFL Blitz to be an \"arcade\" football experience, different from the simulation-oriented Madden series. The result was the 2012 title simply called \"NFL Blitz\".\n\nCritical reception for \"Blitz: The League\" was mostly positive. Gamerankings.com gives the PlayStation 2 release a score of 75% and the Xbox release a score of 77%. GameSpot.com gave both PS2 and Xbox versions an 8.6/10.\n\n"}
{"id": "1956226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956226", "title": "Pudu Prison", "text": "Pudu Prison\n\nThe Pudu Prison () was a prison in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Built in phases by the British colonial government between 1891 and 1895, it stood on Jalan Shaw (now Jalan Hang Tuah). The construction began with its 394-metre prison wall at a cost of Straits $16,000, and had been adorned with the world's longest mural at one point in its history. The cells were small and dark, each equipped with a window only the size of a shoebox. As of December 2012, the prison complex was largely demolished, leaving only the main gate and a portion of the exterior wall still standing.\n\nPudu Prison, also known as Pudu Jail, was built on the site of a former Chinese burial ground. At the time, Pudu was a dense jungle area, with tigers occasionally roaming around. Construction began in 1891, using convicts as workforce. It took about four years and was finally complete in 1895. The first governor of Pudu Prison was Lt. Col. J.A.B. Ellen.\n\nA few months after its completion, in August 1895, a cholera plague struck the prison and killed a few hundred inmates. Later, it was found that the plague was caused by the prison's water supply system, which relied on an old well belonging to the Chinese cemetery previously on the site. An inspection by the British colonial authorities revealed that the water in the well was severely contaminated by deadly viruses. The water problem was not fixed until 1898.\n\nIn 1911, Richard Alfred Ernest Clark, a former soldier of the third battalion of the Middlesex Regiment, was one of the European warders in the history of Pudu Prison.\n\nEarly in its history, Pudu Prison was the only prison in the state of Selangor and used to imprison men and women with short sentences. The prison was also self-sufficient as it had a vegetable garden that could produce enough food for its inmates annually.\nThe prison later housed criminals including drug offenders and was a location for administering corporal punishment by rotan caning. The canings were administered in a special \"caning area\", so marked, which was not inside the main building but on the prison grounds.\n\nIn 1984, an inmate named Khong Yen Chong used some 2,000 litres of paint to create an impressive mural of tropical scenes. It measured some 860 feet by 14 feet and was mentioned in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest mural in the world. Khong, as an inmate, was not able to complete the mural. He returned later as a free man and volunteered his time to complete his masterpiece. \n\nAnother source points to a mural painter by the name of Pang Sun Qiang, or otherwise known as Pha Tee within the Prison. \n\nDuring World War II, the Japanese occupation forces incarcerated many Allied POWs there.\n\nIn 1986, the Pudu Prison siege took place. In this incident, a group of prisoners seized and held two members of the prison staff as hostages over a period of six days. The siege was resolved when Malaysian police stormed the prison. They successfully rescued the hostages and subdued the prisoners without loss of life.\n\nIn 1996, after 101 years as a prison, Pudu Prison was formally closed and the inmates were moved to Sungai Buloh Prison and Kajang Prison. It continued to be used until 2009 as a day-holding facility for prisoners attending court hearings. It was used as a museum for a period in 1997. Additionally, eight supporters of the Hindu Rights Action Force were arrested and incarcerated in Pudu Prison following the 2007 HINDRAF rally. They were later released due to lack of evidence.\n\nIn June 2009, the government finally decided to demolish the complex by developing it in phases. When the MP for Bukit Bintang, Fong Kui Lun (DAP) asked why the building was not being retained as part of Malaysia's heritage, Deputy Finance Minister Awang Adek Hussain (UMNO-BN) replied: \"To our opinion, it's not something to be proud of.\". The hanging chamber, along with the prison hospital, were the first structures to be torn down in October that year.\n\nIn June 2010, the eastern wall of the Pudu Prison complex was demolished to make way for a road-widening project. By December 2012, all buildings within the Pudu Prison complex were completely demolished, with only a part of the exterior wall and main gate still standing.\n\nThe former prison site, now a construction site, can at present be viewed by the public only from the outside. A clear view of the site can be obtained from the monorail train between Imbi and Hang Tuah stations. The site is now undergoing a US$1 billion redevelopment plan by the Urban Development Authority of Malaysia; the new development is to be called Bukit Bintang City Centre.\n\nBotak Chin, an infamous gangster who was allegedly betrayed by his own men, was executed here on 11 June 1981 for the possession of firearms.\n\nIn 1986 Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers, both Australian nationals, were executed in Pudu Prison for trafficking heroin. In 1989, Derrick Gregory, a British national was also hanged for heroin trafficking.\n\n"}

Every year in the spring, around September, the town holds a mock regatta which large numbers of locals and tourists attend. Food and drink are sold at stalls, \"no fishing\" signs are put up, and the celebration takes all day. It is the only dry river regatta in the world; thus, it is the only regatta ever cancelled because of wet weather, on the occasion when there is actually water in the river. This happened in 1993, when the event was cancelled for the year due to flooding. However, the Alice Springs Hash House Harriers and Katherine Hash House Harriers running groups put their boat entry into the water and completed the course under protest of the track officials. This was televised by ABC and shown around Australia on the nightly news. \n\n\"Boats\" are made from metal frames and hung with banners and advertisements, and teams of \"rowers\" run their boats in races through the hot sand. Races are also held in washtubs, human-sized hamster wheels and at the final event, modified trucks decked out as boats are driven by teams armed with flour bombs and water cannon. Many bystanders end up as casualties of the final battle. Traditional teams include Pirates and Vikings, complete with costumes. Who wins the final battle can be difficult to determine; even the announcers occasionally get a blast.\n\nReg Smith at the Alice Springs Meteorological Bureau proposed an actual regatta along the lines of the famous Henley Royal Regatta (at Henley-on-Thames, thus the name of the regatta) in 1962. The idea was taken up by the Rotary club of Alice Springs, and despite the fact that the town was from the nearest large body of water this was never seen as a problem.\n\nWatching seemingly sane people race in bottomless \"eights\", \"Oxford tubs\", \"bath tubs\" and yachts through the deep coarse sand of the Todd River is a unique spectacle amongst world sporting events and attracts many local and international participants.\n\nThe Henley-On-Todd Regatta is run entirely on a volunteer basis by three Rotary Clubs based in 'the Alice'. \n\nThe Todd River was named by surveyor W. W. Mills after Lady Alice Todd (née Alice Gillam Bell), wife of Sir Charles Todd, Postmaster General of South Australia and driving force for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line from Port Augusta to Darwin. The river is usually dry, but prone to flooding during the wet season. The Alice Springs were discovered in 1871 during the construction of this line.\n\n"}

It is similar to \"NBA Hangtime\"; \"Showtime\" is modeled after the NBA presentations on NBC though using the same control scheme as \"Hangtime\". The original arcade version features team rosters from the beginning of the 1998-99 NBA season, while the console versions feature team rosters that were accurate just prior to the 1998-99 NBA season. A \"Gold\" version for arcades features another roster update from later in the 1999-2000 NBA season. \"Showtime\" was also featured in a dual game cabinet along with \"NFL Blitz 2000\". Midway followed up the game with the console exclusive \"NBA Hoopz\".\n\nThe home versions have Shaquille O'Neal as cover athlete after the contract mismanagement lawsuit was handled for his exclusion from Hangtime.\n\nThe game features gameplay similar to its predecessors \"NBA Jam\" and \"NBA Hangtime\". Rather than typical 5 on 5 action, this game features 2 on 2 play with the ability to pick two players from any NBA team's starting line-up for the first half and can choose again for the second. The game introduces personal fouls for each shove on another player; after a certain number of fouls the opposing team gets a free throw. The game retains the series standard \"on fire\" feature. After a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes \"on fire\", which allows him to easily make shots from almost anywhere, as well as goaltend without penalty and push opponents without being charged a foul. Play otherwise is similar to NBA rules. The arcade version accommodates up to four players, as do the home versions produced for the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast.\n\nThe players featured in the game include many of the most popular players of the particular year and era of the NBA season, but like the previous games in the arcade-style basketball series, many players were left out and each team has a limited number of players per position to choose from.\n\nAs with the previous \"NBA Jam\" and \"NBA Hangtime\" games, the game contains many secret characters. The arcade version features the Universal Monsters Frankenstein's monster, Bride of Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man and Creature from the Black Lagoon as secret characters. Many Midway Games staff are also secret playable characters.\n\nThe game-time commentary is particularly varied and colorful for basketball games of that period, featuring such phrases as \"The dejection of the rejection!\", \"He just flat-out leveled him!\", as well as \"With the silky smooth move!\" and \"Look Ma, no rim!\"\n\nThe original announcer from NBA Jam, Tim Kitzrow, returned, after Midway used the Bulls radio announcer Neil Funk in \"NBA Hangtime\". Jon Hey produced all the sound, music and script save for the NBC basketball theme \"Roundball Rock\" by John Tesh. At the time, the music was influenced by 2Pac and Dr. Dre's \"California Love\" and Master P's \"Make 'Em Say Uhh!\" and previous NBA Themes written by Jon Hey for NBA Jam and NBA Hangtime.\n\nThe N64 version does not feature a \"back\" button, having every button advance through the menus.\n\nDoug Trueman reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Arcade-style basketball action captured remarkably well on Nintendo 64.\"\n\nThe Dreamcast version received \"favorable\" reviews, and the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation versions received mixed or average reviews, while the Game Boy Color version received \"unfavorable\" reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings.\n\n"}

McConnell\n\nMichael William McConnell (born May 18, 1955 in Louisville, Kentucky) is a constitutional law scholar who served as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit from 2002 until 2009. Since 2009, McConnell has served as a professor and Director of the Stanford Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School. He is also a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, and Senior Of Counsel to the Litigation Practice Group at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. On 6 May 2020, Facebook appointed him to its content oversight board.\n\nMcConnell graduated from Michigan State University's James Madison College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1976. McConnell received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Chicago Law School in 1979, where he was an editor of the \"University of Chicago Law Review\". He was a law clerk for J. Skelly Wright, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1979 to 1980 and for Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr., Supreme Court of the United States from 1980 to 1981. He was an assistant general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget, 1981–1983, and an assistant to the Solicitor General, U.S. Department of Justice from 1983 to 1985. McConnell was a professor at the University of Chicago Law School from 1985 to 1996, where he brought Barack Obama on a fellowship after being impressed with a suggestion Obama, the \"Harvard Law Review\" president, had made on one of McConnell's articles. McConnell has been professor at the University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law, as well as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School and at the New York University School of Law.\n\nAs a law professor, McConnell has published a variety of legal articles and edited several books. As a lawyer, he has argued cases in federal courts of appeals and before the Supreme Court, including a 5–4 victory in \"Rosenberger v. University of Virginia\". He is widely regarded as one of the preeminent constitutional law scholars on the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses.\n\nIn 1996, McConnell signed a statement supporting a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, which read, \"Abortion kills 1.5 million innocent human beings in America every year. ... We believe that the abortion license is a critical factor in America's virtue deficit.\"\n\nAs a respected constitutional scholar during his law school tenure, McConnell contended that originalism is consistent with the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision \"Brown v. Board of Education\", as opposed to critics of originalism who argue that they are inconsistent. McConnell has likewise argued that the Court's decision in \"Bolling v. Sharpe\" was correct but should have been reached on other grounds, as Congress never \"required that the schools of the District of Columbia be segregated.\"\n\nMcConnell was highly critical of the Supreme Court's decision in \"Bush v. Gore\":\nI imagine that Gov. Bush and his supporters will put on a brave face and defend this decision, but I cannot imagine that there is much joy in Austin tonight. The Supreme Court, with all the prestige of its position in American public life, could have brought closure to this matter. But instead, by straddling the fence, the court has produced a combination of holdings that can please no one.\n\nMcConnell was nominated by President George W. Bush on September 4, 2001 to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on November 15, 2002 by voice vote.\n\nWhile sitting on the Tenth Circuit, McConnell wrote scores of judicial opinions. The Supreme Court reviewed four cases in which McConnell wrote an opinion; in each case the Court reached the same result as the opinion by Judge McConnell. First, in \"Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal\" (2006), a case involving the religious use of a hallucinogenic tea, the Supreme Court affirmed 8–0 a Tenth Circuit en banc decision to which Judge McConnell wrote a concurring opinion. Second, in \"Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales\" (2008), a case involving the retroactive application of a statutory provision limiting appeals from immigration removal orders, the Supreme Court affirmed 8–1 a Tenth Circuit panel decision written by Judge McConnell. Third, in \"Begay v. United States\"(2008), a case involving whether a felony conviction for driving under the influence is a crime of violence for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, the Supreme Court reversed 6–3 a Tenth Circuit panel decision from which McConnell dissented. Fourth, in \"Pleasant Grove City v. Summum\"(2009), a case involving whether the presence of a Ten Commandments monument on government property gave another religion a First Amendment right to place its own monument on the same property, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed a Tenth Circuit panel decision that McConnell had challenged by writing a dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.\n\nSignificant opinions written by McConnell include the following:\n\nMcConnell was mentioned as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court during the administration of President George W. Bush. In June 2005, amid expectations that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist would retire at the end of the Court's term, some sources cited McConnell as a frontrunner for Rehnquist's seat, which ultimately went to John Roberts. Professor Stephen B. Presser of Northwestern University School of Law argued that McConnell was, \"high on the White House's short list\" because:\n\nMcConnell was also mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee in a John McCain or Mitt Romney presidency.\n\n\n\nHis academic scholarship includes, among other publications, the following:\n\n"}

{"id": "1956288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956288", "title": "RF switch", "text": "RF switch\n\nAn RF switch or microwave switch is a device to route high frequency signals through transmission paths. RF (radio frequency) and microwave switches are used extensively in microwave test systems for signal routing between instruments and devices under test (DUT). Incorporating a switch into a switch matrix system enables you to route signals from multiple instruments to single or multiple DUTs. This allows multiple tests to be performed with the same setup, eliminating the need for frequent connects and disconnects. The entire testing process can be automated, increasing the throughput in high-volume production environments.\n\nLike other electrical switches, RF and microwave switches provide different configurations for many different applications. Below is a list of typical switch configurations and usage:\n\n\nRF CMOS switches are crucial to modern wireless telecommunication, including wireless networks and mobile communication devices. Infineon's bulk CMOS RF switches sell over 1billion units annually, reaching a cumulative 5billion units, .\n\nThe two main kinds of RF and microwave switches have different capabilities:\n\n\nRF and microwave applications range in frequency from 100 MHz for semiconductor to 60 GHz for satellite communications. Broadband accessories increase test system flexibility by extending frequency coverage. However, frequency is always application dependent and a broad operating frequency may be sacrificed to meet other critical parameters. For example, a network analyzer may perform a 1 ms sweep for an insertion loss measurement, so for this application settling time or switching speed becomes the critical parameter for ensuring measurement accuracy.\n\nIn addition to proper frequency selection, insertion loss is critical to testing. Losses greater than 1 or 2 dB will attenuate peak signal levels and increase rising and falling edge times. A low insertion loss system can be achieved by minimizing the number of connectors and through-paths, or by selecting low insertion loss devices for system configuration. As power is expensive at higher frequencies, electromechanical switches provide the lowest possible loss along the transmission path.\n\nReturn loss is caused by impedance mismatch between circuits. At microwave frequencies, the material properties as well as the dimensions of a network element play a significant role in determining the impedance match or mismatch caused by the distributed effect. Switches with excellent return loss performance ensure optimum power transfer through the switch and the entire network.\n\nLow insertion loss repeatability reduces sources of random errors in the measurement path, which improves measurement accuracy. The repeatability and reliability of a switch guarantees measurement accuracy and can cut the cost of ownership by reducing calibration cycles and increasing test system uptime.\n\nIsolation is the degree of attenuation from an unwanted signal detected at the port of interest. Isolation becomes more important at higher frequencies. High isolation reduces the influence of signals from other channels, sustains the integrity of the measured signal, and reduces system measurement uncertainties. For instance, a switch matrix may need to route a signal to a spectrum analyzer for measurement at –70 dBm and to simultaneously route another signal at +20 dBm. In this case, switches with high isolation, 90 dB or more, will keep the measurement integrity of the low-power signal.\n\nSwitching speed is defined as the time needed to change the state of a switch port (arm) from \"ON' to \"OFF\" or from \"OFF\" to \"ON\".\n\nAs switching time only specifies an end value of 90% of the settled/final value of the RF signal, settling time is often highlighted in solid state switch performance where the need for accuracy and precision is more critical. Settling time is measured to a level closer to the final value. The widely used margin-to-final value of settling time is 0.01 dB (99.77% of the final value) and 0.05 dB (98.86% of the final value). This specification is commonly used for GaAs FET switches because they have a gate lag effect caused by electrons becoming trapped on the surface of the GaAs.\n\nPower handling defines the ability of a switch to handle power and is very dependent on the design and materials used. There are different power handling ratings for switches such as hot switching, cold switching, average power and peak power. Hot switching occurs when RF/microwave power is present at the ports of the switching at the time of the switching. Cold switching occurs when the signal power is removed before switching. Cold switching results in lower contact stress and longer life.\n\nA 50-ohm load termination is critical in many applications, since each open unused transmission line has the possibility to resonate. This is important when designing a system that works up to 26 GHz or higher frequencies where switch isolation drops considerably. When the switch is connected to an active device, the reflected power of an unterminated path could possibly damage the source.\n\nVideo leakage refers to the spurious signals present at the RF ports of the switch when it is switched without an RF signal present. These signals arise from the waveforms generated by the switch driver and, in particular, from the leading edge voltage spike required for high-speed switching of PIN diodes. The amplitude of the video leakage depends on the design of the switch and the switch driver.\n\nA long operating life reduces cost per cycle and budgetary constraints allowing manufacturers to be more competitive.\n\n\n"}

Known as \"Shahganj\" or King's ganj or market place during Mughal era, it is one of the three administrative subdivisions, of the Central Delhi district, of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, with the other two being, Darya Ganj and Karol Bagh.\n\nKnown for its concentration of affordable hotels, lodges, restaurants, dhabas and a wide variety of shops catering to both domestic travellers and foreign tourists, especially backpackers and low-budget travellers, it has become particularly popular as a haunt for international cuisine.\n\nIn the years after its establishment in 1638, Shahjahanabad, the capital of the Mughal Empire under Shah Jahan, was no longer contained within the walled city, it soon spilled into surrounding areas, stretching into miles at each end, where half of its population stayed. By 1739, the suburbs covered 1800 acres and included areas like Mughalpura, Sabzimandi, Paharganj, and Jaisingh Pura. One of the largest and most important suburban mohalla of the Walled City of Delhi, and located just outside the \"Ajmeri Gate\" of the Walled city, Paharganj was one of five main markets of Delhi, and the only one outside the walled city. Also, it was the principal grain market of the city in the 18th century, where grain was ferried, across Yamuna River, from wholesale markets and warehouses in Patparganj and Shahdara. Just outside the Ajmeri Gate was the custom house of the emperor, for collecting taxes. Between Paharganj and Akbarabadi gate of the walled city was \"Shahganj\", another wholesale market, while on the other side towards Jantar Mantar was \"Raja Bazar\"., In fact, Paharganj was also referred as \"Shahganj\" or King's ganj or market place during Mughal era, it gets its present name 'Paharganj', literally meaning \"Hilly neighbourhood\", owing to its proximity to the Raisina Hill, where the Rashtrapati Bhavan stand today. Till, 1857, neighbourhoods like Paharganj, Kishenganj, and Pahari Dhiraj, were separate pockets which in the following years grew and merged, for example Pahari Dhiraj merged into Sadar Bazaar.\n\nIn the 1690s, Ghaziuddin Khan, a general of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, a leading Deccan commander and the father of Asaf Jah I, the founder of the Asaf Jahi dynasty of Hyderabad, through religious endowment founded a madarsa, \"Madrasa Ghaziuddin Khan\" after him. It eventually paved way for the present Zakir Hussain College, which is 1986, shifted to a new building outside Turkman Gate, the old structure in the Madrasa Ghaziuddin complex, still houses a hostel for the college and also has Ghaziuddin's mausoleum.\n\nWhen the Lutyens' Delhi, was being built in the 1920s, the area also saw major development, and the old 'Imperial theatre', built-in 1930, stands as a legacy to that era. Though its neighboring area of \"Jaisinghpura\", where Gurudwara Bangla Sahib stands today, along with \"Madhoganj\" and \"Raja ka Bazaar\" were demolished to make way for the Connaught Place, shopping district. Indeed, the \"Delhi Town Planning Committee on the planning of new Imperial capital\" with George Swinton as chairman and John A. Brodie and Lutyens as members, submitted its report on 13 June 1912, it proposed a plan to include Paharganj and Sadar Bazaar into the developing new imperial city, as they were only areas of Old Delhi, spilling into the planned New Delhi area. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy, when the cost of compensation while acquiring the properties, was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east at India Gate, was previously meant to be a North-South axis, linking Viceroy's House with Paharganj, as the end of the axis.\n\nGradually, \"Chai-Tuti-Chowk\" or Six Tuti Chowk, named after six water taps originally place here for the public, developed as an important market square, and a shopping area of Paharganj, within shops of cloth merchants coming up around it. Prior to the inauguration of New Delhi in 1931, the New Delhi Railway Station was opened with a single platform near Ajmeri Gate in 1926, till then the Old Delhi Railway Station served the entire city. This changed Paharganj landscape indelibly, with an influx of travelers, small eateries started coming up in the area, and also temporary residential facilities.\n\nThe famous \"Shri Nand Lal Sharma dhaba\" was set up here in 1928, over time, his son built a three-storey hotel on spot, and now his grandson manages the \"Metropolis\", known for its rooftop restaurant, which still has many Russian dishes on its menu. \"Shiela Cinema\" at Paharganj was Delhi's first 70mm screen, second being \"Odeon\" in Connaught Place. \"Imperial\" and \"Khanna\" were other talkies in the area. Gradually, the entire area was catering to the tourism industry, though the grain bazaars of Mughal era were long gone, in early 20th century, Paharganj still had principal markets in Delhi for building materials, cement, timber and steel, but by 1947 they had mostly shifted to other locations in the city, while Paharganj had become primarily a densely populated residential and commercial area, replete with cheap hotels and restaurants for domestic and foreign tourists.\n\nPaharganj witnessed upheavals during the prolonged Indian independence struggle, like during the Quit India Movement of August 1942, the British barracks near Paharganj were attacked and the soldiers' were thrown out, who then sought refuge in an Indian's bungalow, later the Paharganj Post office and five terminal tax posts were also raided by the mob and burnt down.\n\nDuring the British Raj, Muslims had built a slaughterhouse closer to the Jhandewalan temple. In May 1924 on the day of Bakri Eid the Muslims of Pahari Dhiraj of Paharganj slaughtered the cow - which is revered by the Hindus as sacred Kamadhenu - in the slaughterhouse closer to the Jhandewala temple. This angered the Hindu Jats of Sadar Bazaar, which led to the riots among the Jats and Muslims from 11 to 18 July, resulting in loss of life and property. Muhammad Ali Jinnah repeatedly requested Mahatma Gandhi and Indian National Congress (INC) to stop the rioting Jats, but Gandhi and INC were unable to control the situation. Riots were eventually stopped by the police.\n\nSubsequently, during the Partition of India in 1947 it again saw extensive rioting, thereafter the area saw a vast influx of Hindu refugees from Pakistan, when several shops and small establishments were allotted to them, since then the area has seen vast development, and seen it the burgeoning marketplace that it is today.\n\nWith the arrival of the Hippie movement in the 70s at India's shores, the area became a regular part of the Hippie trail, for hippies, backpackers, and college students looking for budget accommodations near Connaught Place, New Delhi and New Delhi Railway Station. Gradually the hotels and guest houses spread till neighboring Ram Nagar and an area along Deshbandhu Gupta Road. This legacy which continues even today, with its streams of budget hotels, cafes and restaurants, specializing in global cuisines, and hordes of cybercafes. Apart from that Paharganj also has a Chabad House as it is frequented by the large number of Jewish and Israeli tourists, and bakeries like 'German Bakery', named 'Ajay Cafe' 19 years ago.\n\nOver the years, Paharganj has become the biggest hotel hub for low-budget foreign tourists in Delhi, though with rising congestion, the proliferation of illegal bars and illegal activities like drug peddling, Paharganj has also become a hotspot for crime, and a criminal hideout. The area has shelters and homes, run by Salaam Baalak Trust, an NGO, for street and working children, established in 1988. The trust has run the Salaam Baalak City Walk - New Delhi, a guided tour through Paharganj and New Delhi Railway Station area. The guides are former street children from the trust. The walk aims to sensitize about street life, street children and Indian society problems. During the walk, the guides share their personal story of survival with the participants and show them the contact points and shelter homes SBT provides.\n\nIn 2005, during 29 October 2005 Delhi serial bombings, the first blast took place in the main bazaar of Paharganj, during busy shopping period, two days before festival of Diwali.\n\nAhead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a massive Rs. 800 million ($17 million) facelift program for Paharganj was implemented by Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2009, it included 56 roads and lanes in Paharganj, where over 500 hotels and lodges were expecting to host visitors for the games. Some shops were demolished in areas like Main Bazar, Ram Nagar market and Amrit Kaur market, markets were given uniform design, all road was relaid, sidewalks and pavements were also added, to decongest the area by September 2010. However, a number of hotels and guest houses have been violating building and hygiene codes, so tourists are advised to avoid the area.\n\nPaharganj is also home to the historic Qadam Sharif dargah, dedicated to the footprint of Prophet Mohammed, originally built by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, a 14th-century Sultan of Delhi. \"Qazi Wali Masjid\", known for its intricate engravings, and arched doorways. The grave of poet laureate of Mughal court, Zauq, who lived nearby Nabi Karim and died in 1854, lies in the bylanes of Paharganj. It was restored in early 2000s, after the Supreme Court orders, but his house was never identified.\n\nToday Sadar-Paharganj constitutes one of the 12 administrative zones of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).\n\nPaharganj was a Delhi Metropolitan Council segment, within the Chandni Chowk, Lok Sabha constituency, 1966–93. Thereafter it remained the Delhi State Assembly constituency, under Chandni Chowk, Lok Sabha constituency, from 1993–2008, Subsequently, following the delimitation of the parliamentary constituencies, in 2008, it became of the New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nThe tourist culture of Paharganj has been a theme for many films, including, Kate Winslet starrer, \"Holy Smoke!\" (1999), parts of which were shot when she stayed at a Paharganj hotel, in September 1998. In 2008, parts of the Hindi film, \"Dev.D\" (2009) directed by Anurag Kashyap were shot in Paharganj area, depicting the seedy side of hotel industry, from prostitution to drug peddling., PAHARGANJ an upcoming film by renowned Indian filmmaker Rakesh Ranjan Kumar starring Spanish actress/author Lorena Franco.\nPaharganj also serves as the home of Danny Matthews in the comic book series Caster by Holy Cow Entertainment.\n\n\n"}

The boys soon find themselves outside the house and bored, and decide to tie a thread to a fly. When the fly enters the Flanders house and is eaten by a cat, Bart and Milhouse find themselves inside the home, unsupervised. They take the opportunity to cause mischief, and discover Ned's collection of Beatles memorabilia in the basement. They drink from cans of a 40-year-old novelty beverage and start to hallucinate, with Bart seeing Milhouse as John Lennon through various stages of his life. When Ned, Rod and Todd return home and discover the damage caused by Bart and Milhouse, they flee to their panic room and call the police. Chief Wiggum and his crew subsequently catch the boys in the basement, and call their parents and says they will take \"The Last Train to Clarksville,\" then Lou corrects Wiggum and says \"That's The Monkees Chief.\" They decide that Bart and Milhouse should spend all their time under parental supervision. Bart is also forbidden from playing with Milhouse, whom Marge believes incites Bart into his bad behavior.\n\nMarge subsequently establishes a peer group based on Native American life, called the \"Pre-Teen Braves.\" It is composed of Bart, Ralph Wiggum, Nelson Muntz, and Database. Homer takes on the role of tribe leader, but when he fails in his leadership skills, Marge takes over. Later, when Marge takes the boys on a nature walk, they meet a Mohican man who shows them a field that is in need of cleaning up. The \"Pre-Teen Braves\" agree to the job, but as they are about to begin, they discover that another peer group, the \"Cavalry Kids\" - led by Milhouse's father, Kirk Van Houten, composed of Milhouse, Martin Prince, Jimbo Jones, and a nerd - have already done it. The two groups decide to go to war, trying to outdo each other in doing good (for example, when the Cavalry Kids used a bulldozer to destroy the house of the homeless from the Pre-Teen Braves and posted a pre-fabricated in place, the Pre-Teen Braves retaliated by setting it on fire with arrows). When they sell candy in the hope of becoming batboys at a Springfield Isotopes game, the \"Pre-Teen Braves\" try to thwart the \"Cavalry Kids\" by lacing their candy bars with laxatives. Unfortunately for them, the senior citizens, in need of relief from constipation, buy the \"Cavalry Kids\" a win.\n\nAt the Isotopes game, the \"Pre-Teen Braves\" make another attempt to defeat the \"Cavalry Kids\". Bart and Homer divert the \"Cavalry Kids\" away from the stadium with a fake \"free VIP parking\" sign, and the \"Pre-Teen Braves\" then disguise themselves as their enemies before singing their own version of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". The crowd becomes angered by this, and when the real \"Cavalry Kids\" arrive, a fight breaks out between everyone. Marge, appalled by this, starts crying, and when this is shown on the Jumbotron, the fighting stops and the Sea Captain suggests that everyone should sing a sweet, soothing hymn like Canada's national anthem instead of a \"hymn to war\" like \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Everyone present sings \"O Canada\" and joins hands to form a maple leaf on the baseball field.\n\nIn the end, Bart and Milhouse sum up the whole experience by saying that they have learned that \"war is not the answer —except to all of America's problems.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1956336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956336", "title": "The Fartz", "text": "The Fartz\n\nThe Fartz were originally formed in 1981 and were one of the first well-known hardcore bands from Seattle, Washington. They were signed to Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles Record label. They were notable not only for playing incredibly fast and heavy music, but also for their politically and socially conscious song lyrics that criticized government policies, religious hypocrisy, racism, sexism, and poverty. Throughout their musical career they championed a blue collar, working class perspective on life.\n\nThe Fartz original lineup in 1981 included vocalist Blaine Cook, guitarist Tommy Hansen, bassist Steve Hoffman, and drummer Loud Fart. Tommy Hansen and Loud had formerly played together in the Seattle band Kaos (not to be confused with the UK version with the same name). Blaine and Steve had first met in 1979 when they worked together at a local restaurant called Red Robin. Tommy Hansen taught Steve Hoffman how to play bass. Steve asked Loud to play drums when he saw him tinkering with Robo's drum kit at a Black Flag show in Seattle. In the punk tradition of the Ramones, each member of the band took on the family name Fart, so they became known as Blaine Fart, Tommy Fart, Steve Fart and Loud Fart. \nOn the strength of the nine song \"Because This Fuckin' World Stinks\" E.P. produced by Neil Hubbard and self-released by the band on their own Fartz Records in 1981 as a 7-inch vinyl 45, they were signed to Jello Biafra's San Francisco-based Alternative Tentacles Records, which released their full length LP entitled \"World Full of Hate\" in 1982 as Virus 17, and also re-released their first single as Virus 21 later that same year. This made the Fartz the first Seattle band since Heart to break out of the local music scene and get signed to an out of town record label.\n\nThey also had one song, \"Campaign Speech,\" appear on the 1981 \"Seattle Syndrome Vol. I\" compilation released by Engram Records.\n\nPaul Dana, who had earlier been in the proto-hardcore Seattle band Solger, replaced Tommy Hansen on guitar during the recording of the band's 1982 album, although Hansen still played on five of the 15 tracks on the LP. After the recording of the first LP was completed in June 1982, Loud was replaced on drums by Duff McKagan, who played on a five-song demo recording that was made in November 1982 but not released until 1990. Duff's role in the Fartz has sometimes been exaggerated. Blaine has been quoted as saying Duff was only \"in the band for a few months,\" while Steve has said he only played one or two shows with Duff in the Fartz. \n\nDuring their brief two-year existence, the Fartz became known as one of the trilogy of West Coast hardcore punk bands that included San Francisco's Dead Kennedys and Vancouver´s D.O.A. These three groups often played together up and down the West Coast between San Francisco, California and Vancouver. The Fartz song \"Buried Alive\" appeared on the \"Eastern Front Vol. II\" punk compilation album released by Enigma Records in 1983, along with tracks by other West Coast hardcore punk acts such as The Lewd, Channel 3, Wasted Youth, Shattered Faith, and JFA. Despite their regional reputation, the Fartz had a difficult time getting booked to play clubs in their own hometown of Seattle, although their practice space was in the backstage area of the Showbox Theater on First Avenue, where many of the early all ages punk shows took place while the venue was managed by Modern Productions.\n\nAfter several changes to the lineup in the guitar and drummer positions, by mid-November 1982 the first incarnation of the Fartz had evolved into a new band known as 10 Minute Warning. The original idea was that the Fartz would simply change their name to 10 Minute Warning, but after one west coast tour with the Dead Kennedys in the Fall of 1982, Blaine was replaced on vocals by Steve Swad (formerly of The Wad Squad). Duff switched from drums to rhythm guitar, Paul continued to play lead guitar, and Greg Gillmore joined on drums. These lineup changes resulted in a post-punk sound quite different from the hardcore of the Fartz. 10 Minute Warning continued with this new lineup and sound throughout 1983, and recorded some additional still unreleased demos, before finally disbanding. Greg Gillmore would later go on to join Mother Love Bone.\n\nAfter a one-off July 4, 1983 reunion show featuring the lineup of Blaine, Steve, Paul, and Duff, the former members of the Fartz went their separate ways for the next 15 years. Fartz vocalist Blaine Cook started to sing for the hardcore/thrash band The Accüsed in 1984. In the same year Duff McKagan moved to Los Angeles and became the bass player for the hard rock band Guns N' Roses within the next year. The Fartz original guitarist Tommy Hansen later played with the band Crisis Party, which released one LP, \"Rude Awakening,\" on Capitol Records in 1989.\n\nInterest in the Fartz began to revive in 1990 with the release in Germany of a vinyl only LP entitled \"You, We See You Crawling,\" which was composed of previously unreleased demo tapes recorded in 1981-1982. In 1998 Alternative Tentacles issued a retrospective anthology of all the group's previous recordings entitled \"Because This Fuckin' World Still Stinks.\" It was the first time any of the Fartz material had been available on CD; all of their previous releases having been vinyl only. The 1998 CD included all the songs from both the 1981 EP and the 1982 LP, as well as unreleased demos that included some songs recorded after the band had changed its name to 10 Minute Warning. Out of the 35 tracks on this anthology, Tommy Hansen played guitar on 15 of them, and Paul Solger on the other 20.\n\nThe release of the 1998 Fartz anthology by Alternative Tentacles prompted Blaine to reunite the lineup that had recorded the majority of the \"World Full of Hate\" LP: Steve, Paul, and Loud. However, this lineup had already changed by June 2000 when a new lineup recorded the four-song \"N.W.T.O.\" E.P. Loud was replaced on drums by Karl Fowler of the Detonators soon after their reunion, while Paul Solger played with reformed Fartz for about a year before he was replaced by Alex \"Maggot Brain\" Sibbald, who had been the bass player in Blaine's other band, the Accused, leaving Blaine and Steve as the only two original members in the reunited Fartz. According to an interview with Blaine, Paul was fired from the reformed Fartz after he failed to show up for the band's performance at Jeff Gilbert's \"Pain in the Grass\" music festival, and almost missed another show in Portland, Oregon. \n\nIt was the lineup of Blaine, Steve, Alex and Karl that recorded the Fartz new studio LP, \"What's In A Name?,\" which was produced by Jack Endino and released by Alternative Tentacles in the summer of 2001. Most of these new studio tracks were re-recordings of their earlier songs, except for a new cover of the Motorhead song \"Iron Fist,\" which had also appeared on the \"N.W.T.O.\" E.P. The back cover of the 2001 LP paid homage to the band's previous members by stating, \"Special thanx to Ex-Fartz: Paul Solger, Loud, Tommy Hansen.\" It then humorously added, \"We apologize for Duff.\" \n\nThis second reincarnation of the Fartz released a full-length studio LP of 15 completely new songs produced by Jack Endino called \"Injustice\" on the Alternative Tentacles label in 2002, as well as a live LP called \"Viet-Raq\" that was released the same year. This 2002 live album combined recordings of two performances in Washington state, one at The Breakroom on February 18, 2000; and a second show at The Lobo Bar on June 29, 2002. The 28 tracks include songs such as \"Is This The Way,\" and \"Buried Alive,\" that have also been associated with the band 10 Minute Warning, as they were first recorded in late 1982 when the Fartz were in the process of changing their name and their lineup. The final incarnation of the reformed Fartz continued to play live shows in the Pacific Northwest until 2003 when Blaine and Alex rejoined a reformed Accused, and then a few years later the duo joined the band Toe Tag.\n\nDue to the band's evolution from the Fartz into 10 Minute Warning and the Accüsed, and then back into the Fartz again, some of the same songs have been recorded by three or four incarnations of the band. \"Is This The Way,\" \"Judgement Day,\" and \"Buried Alive\" were all recorded by various versions of the Fartz and 10 Minute Warning. The Accüsed also re-recorded some Fartz songs.\n\n1981-1982:\n\n1982-1983:\n\n1999:\n\n2000-2003:\n\n\n"}

To see which multimedia players support which container format, look at comparison of media players.\n\nIn many ways, derived containers are similar to those on which they are based, sometimes extending them, sometimes limiting their capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that some common multimedia file formats are not completely distinct container formats. Some are containers for specific audio and video coding formats, such as WebM, a subset of Matroska. Some are combinations of common container formats and audio and video coding profiles, such as AVCHD and DivX formats. Although sometimes compared to DivX products, Xvid is neither a container format nor a video format, it is a software library that encodes video using specific coding profiles of the common MPEG-4 ASP video format. Those types of restrictions are intended to simplify the construction of multimedia recorders and players.\n\nNote that converting image subtitles to text formats is possible using third-party tools but relies on optical character recognition, which is not perfectly accurate and can at best extract basic formatting. Conversion of text to images is possible while preserving content and style. Round-trip format conversion between text formats may not be possible without losing some formatting features.\n\nMultimedia containers interleave data in media streams to enable efficient playback using less computational resources, such as time spent reading from the storage drive, memory needed to buffer selected media streams, and time spent decoding when seeking to a different position in time. In this sense, muxing overhead is the control information added by the container to carry interleaved streams. A smaller overhead results in a smaller file when carrying the same streams with the same data. Overhead is affected by the total number of packets and by the size of stream packet headers. In high bitrate encodings, the content payload is usually large enough to make the overhead data relatively insignificant, but in low bitrate encodings, the inefficiency of the overhead can significantly affect the resulting file size if the container uses large stream packet headers or a large number of packets.\n\nIn general, Matroska offers the least overhead, followed by MP4, AVI and Ogg.\n\n"}

October 1877 – 1 December 1951), also known as Te Rangi Hīroa or Te Rangihīroa, was a New Zealand doctor, military leader, health administrator, politician, anthropologist and museum director. He was a prominent member of Ngāti Mutunga, his mother's Māori iwi.\n\nPeter Buck was born in Urenui, New Zealand, the only child of Anglo-Irish immigrant William Henry Buck and Rina, a Māori woman. William's wife Ngarongo-ki-tua had been unable to have children and, in line with Māori custom, Rina, one of Ngarongo's relatives, became part of the household and produced a child for the couple. Rina died soon after Peter was born, and Ngarongo raised him as her own. He claimed to have been born in 1880, but the register of the primary school he attended records October 1877, which is likely to be correct.\n\nTe Rangi Hīroa was descended on his Māori (maternal) side from the Taranaki iwi of Ngāti Mutunga. In his teens, his elders gave him the name Te Rangi Hīroa (also written Te Rangihiroa) in honour of an uncle of Ngarongo's and an earlier notable ancestor. His paternal ancestry was English and Irish. Though he was largely brought up within the Pākehā (the Maori term for non-Maori \n\npeople, Caucasian people in particular) community, Ngarongo-ki-tua and his great-aunt Kapuakore instilled a love of Māori tradition and language in him.\n\nAfter Ngarongo's death in 1892 he moved with his father to the Wairarapa. In 1896 he started attending Te Aute College, a school that produced many Māori leaders of the time. In 1899 he was named Dux and passed a medical preliminary examination, entitling him to attend the University of Otago Medical School. He was later associated with the Young Māori Party.\n\nBuck did well at Otago Medical School, where he also succeeded in sport, becoming national long jump champion in 1900 and 1903. He completed his MB ChB in 1904, and an MD six years later. During this time, in 1905, he married Irish-born Margaret Wilson. Their long marriage was often fiery, but was strong, and it was Margaret who often gave the impetus to Peter's career.\n\nIn November 1905 Buck was appointed as a medical officer to Māori, working under Māui Pōmare, initially in the southern North Island, then in the far north. Between them Pomare and Buck campaigned successfully to improve sanitation in the small Māori communities around the country.\n\nIn 1909, Hone Heke Ngapua, Member of Parliament for Northern Maori died suddenly. Buck was singled out by Native Minister James Carroll to be his replacement. Buck accepted and was elected in the subsequent by-election. He became a member of the Native Affairs Committee. He did not seek re-election to the seat in 1914, but stood for the Bay of Islands electorate, where he lost with a narrow margin. By this time, Buck had developed an interest in Pacific Island peoples, working briefly as a medical officer in both the Cook Islands and Niue during parliamentary breaks.\n\nDuring the First World War, Buck helped in the recruitment of a Māori volunteer contingent. Buck joined this contingent as medical officer, travelling to the Middle East in 1915. He took part at Gallipoli, later being awarded a Distinguished Service Order for his heroism. He later saw action in France and Belgium, before being posted to the No 3 New Zealand General Hospital at Codford, England in 1918.\n\nReturning to New Zealand, Buck was appointed as Chief Maori Medical Officer, and in 1921 was named director of the Maori Hygiene Division in the Department of Health.\n\nBuck gained a five-year research fellowship at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1927. At the end of the fellowship in 1932 he was appointed Bishop Museum visiting professor of anthropology at Yale University. He was promoted to Director of the Bishop Museum in 1936, a position he held until his death in 1951. He also served as a Trustee and President of the Board of Trustees of the museum.\n\nIn 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. In the 1946 King's Birthday Honours, Buck was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George for services to science and literature.\n\nThe Te Rangi Hiroa Medal is a social sciences award given biennially by the Royal Society of New Zealand. It is awarded for work in one of four disciplines: historical approaches to societal transformation and change; current issues in cultural diversity and cohesion; social and economic policy and development; and medical anthropology.\n\nOne of the residential colleges of the University of Otago is named Te Rangi Hīroa College in his honour.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1956359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956359", "title": "Revealed preference", "text": "Revealed preference\n\nRevealed preference theory, pioneered by economist Paul Samuelson, is a method of analyzing choices made by individuals, mostly used for comparing the influence of policies on consumer behavior. Revealed preference models assume that the preferences of consumers can be revealed by their purchasing habits.\n\nRevealed preference theory arose because existing theories of consumer demand were based on a diminishing marginal rate of substitution (MRS). This diminishing MRS relied on the assumption that consumers make consumption decisions to maximise their utility. While utility maximisation was not a controversial assumption, the underlying utility functions could not be measured with great certainty. Revealed preference theory was a means to reconcile demand theory by defining utility functions by observing behaviour.\n\nTherefore, revealed preference is a way to infer the preferences of individuals given the observed choices. It contrasts with attempts to directly measure preferences or utility, for example through stated preferences. Taking economics to be an empirical subject, there is the issue that one cannot observe preferences. In other words, according to advocates of revealed preference theory \"It is not what you say, it is what you do that reveals what you want.\" \n\nRevealed preference theory tries to understand the preferences of a consumer among bundles of goods, given their budget constraint. For instance, if a consumer buys bundle of goods \"A\" over bundle of goods \"B\", where both bundles of goods are affordable, it is revealed that they directly prefer \"A\" over \"B\". It is assumed that the consumer's preferences are stable over the observed time period, i.e. the consumer will not reverse their relative preferences regarding \"A\" and \"B\".\n\nAs a concrete example, if a person chooses 2 apples/3 bananas over an affordable alternative 3 apples/2 bananas, then we say that the first bundle is \"revealed preferred\" to the second. It is assumed that the first bundle of goods is always preferred to the second, and that the consumer purchases the second bundle of goods only if the first bundle becomes unaffordable.\n\nLet there be two bundles of goods, a and b, available in a budget set formula_1. If it is observed that a is chosen over b, we say that a is (directly) \"revealed preferred\" to b.\n\nIf the budget set formula_1 is defined for two goods; formula_3, and determined by prices formula_4 and income formula_5, then let bundle a be formula_6 and bundle b be formula_7. This situation would typically be represented arithmetically by the inequality formula_8 and graphically by a budget line in the positive real numbers. Assuming strongly monotonic preferences, we only need to consider bundles that graphically are located on the budget line, i.e. bundles where formula_9 and formula_10 are satisfied. If, in this situation, it is observed that formula_11 is chosen over formula_12, we conclude that formula_11 is (directly) revealed preferred to formula_12, which can be summarized as the binary relation formula_15 or equivalently as formula_16.\n\nWARP is one of the criteria which needs to be satisfied in order to make sure that the consumer is consistent with his preferences. If a bundle of goods a is chosen over another bundle b when both are affordable, then the consumer reveals that they prefer a over b. WARP says that when preferences remain the same, there are no circumstances (budget set) where the consumer strictly prefers b over a. By choosing a over b when both bundles are affordable, the consumer reveals that their preferences are such that they will never choose b over a, while prices remain constant. Formally:\n\nwhere formula_18 and formula_19 are arbitrary bundles and formula_20 is the set of bundles chosen in budget set formula_1, given preference relation formula_22.\n\nAlternatively, if a is chosen over b in budget set formula_1 where both a and b are feasible bundles, but b is chosen over a when the consumer faces some other budget set formula_24, then a is not a feasible bundle in budget set formula_24. This equivalent statement of WARP can formally and more generally be expressed as\n\nSuch that formula_27.\n\nThe strong axiom of revealed preferences (SARP) is equivalent to the weak axiom of revealed preferences, except that the consumer is not allowed to be indifferent between the two bundles that are compared. That is, if WARP concludes formula_16, SARP goes a step further and concludes formula_29 .\n\nIf A is directly revealed preferred to B, and B is directly revealed preferred to C, then we say A is \"indirectly\" revealed preferred to C. It is possible for A and C to be (directly or indirectly) revealed preferable to each other at the same time, creating a \"loop\". In mathematical terminology, this says that transitivity is violated.\n\nConsider the following choices: formula_30 , formula_31 , formula_32, where formula_33 is the choice function taking a set of options (budget set) to a choice. Then by our definition A is (indirectly) revealed preferred to C (by the first two choices) and C is (directly) revealed preferred to A (by the last choice).\n\nIt is often desirable in economic models to prevent such loops from happening, for example if we wish to model choices with utility functions (which have real-valued outputs and are thus transitive). One way to do so is to impose completeness on the revealed preference relation with regards to the situations, i.e. every possible situation must be taken into consideration by a consumer. This is useful because if we can consider {A,B,C} as a situation, we can \"directly\" tell which option is preferred to the other (or if they are the same). Using the weak axiom then prevents two choices from being preferred over each other at the same time; thus it would be impossible for \"loops\" to form.\n\nAnother way to solve this is to impose the \"strong axiom of revealed preference\" (SARP) which ensures transitivity. This is characterized by taking the transitive closure of direct revealed preferences and require that it is antisymmetric, i.e. if A is revealed preferred to B (directly or indirectly), then B is not revealed preferred to A (directly or indirectly).\n\nThese are two different approaches to solving the issue; completeness is concerned with the input (domain) of the choice functions; while the strong axiom imposes conditions on the output.\n\nSeveral economists criticized the theory of revealed preferences for different reasons.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1956387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956387", "title": "Internet Explorer 6", "text": "Internet Explorer 6\n\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) is the sixth major revision of Internet Explorer, a web browser developed by Microsoft for Windows operating systems. It was released on August 27, 2001, shortly after the completion of Windows XP.\n\nIt is the default browser shipped with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, and was also made available for Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Windows Me. IE6 SP1 is the last version of Internet Explorer available for the latter four Windows versions. IE6 SP2+ and IE7 were only included (IE6 SP2+) in or available (IE7) for Windows XP SP2+.\n\nDespite dominating market share (attaining a peak of 90% in mid-2004), this version of Internet Explorer has been widely criticized for its security issues and lack of support for modern web standards, making frequent appearances in \"worst tech products of all time\" lists, with \"PC World\" labeling it \"the least secure software on the planet.\" In 2004, Mozilla finalised Firefox to rival IE6, and it became highly popular and acclaimed for its security, add-ons, speed and other modern features such as tabbed browsing. Microsoft planned to fix these issues in Internet Explorer 7 by June–August 2005, but it was delayed until an October 2006 release, over 5 years after IE6 debuted.\n\nBecause a substantial percentage of the web audience still used the outdated browser (especially in China), campaigns were established in the late-2000s to encourage users to upgrade to newer versions of Internet Explorer or switch to different browsers. Some websites dropped support for IE6 entirely, most notable of which was Google dropping support in some of its services in March 2010. According to Microsoft's modern.ie website, , 3.1% of users in China and less than 1% in other countries were using IE6.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 was the last version to be called \"Microsoft Internet Explorer\"; the software was rebranded as \"Windows Internet Explorer\" from Internet Explorer 7 onward.\n\nWhen IE6 was released, it included a number of enhancements over its predecessor, Internet Explorer 5. It and its layout engine Trident are required for many programs including Microsoft Encarta. IE6 improved support for Cascading Style Sheets, adding a number of properties that previously had not been implemented and fixing bugs such as the Internet Explorer box model bug. In Windows XP, IE6 introduced a redesigned interface based on the operating system's default theme, Luna.\n\nIn addition, IE6 added DHTML enhancements, content restricted inline frames, and partial support of DOM level 1 and SMIL 2.0. The MSXML engine was also updated to version 3.0. Other new features included a new version of the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) which introduced IExpress, a utility to create self-extracting INF-based installation packages, Media bar, Windows Messenger integration, fault collection, automatic image resizing, and P3P. Meanwhile, in 2002, the Gopher protocol was disabled.\n\nIE6 was the most widely used web browser during its tenure, surpassing Internet Explorer 5.x. At its peak in 2002 and 2003, IE6 attained a total market share of nearly 90%, with all versions of IE combined reaching 95%. There was little change in IE's market share for several years until Mozilla Firefox was released and gradually began to gain popularity. Microsoft subsequently resumed development of Internet Explorer and released Internet Explorer 7, further reducing the number of IE6 users.\n\nIn a May 7, 2003 Microsoft online chat, Brian Countryman, Internet Explorer Program Manager, declared that Internet Explorer would cease to be distributed separately from Windows (IE6 would be the last standalone version); it would, however, be continued as a part of the evolution of Windows, with updates coming only bundled in Windows upgrades. Thus, Internet Explorer and Windows itself would be kept more in sync. However, after one release in this fashion (IE6 SP2 in Windows XP SP2, in August 2004), Microsoft changed its plan and released Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 in late 2006.\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer 6 was the last version of Internet Explorer to have \"Microsoft\" in the title: later versions changed branding to \"Windows Internet Explorer\", as a reaction to the findings of anti-competitive tying of Internet Explorer and Windows raised in \"United States v. Microsoft\" and the European Union Microsoft competition case.\n\nOn March 4, 2011, Microsoft urged web users to stop using IE6 in favor of newer versions of Internet Explorer. They launched a website called IE6 Countdown, which would show how much percentage of the world uses IE6 and aim to get people to upgrade.\n\nThe security advisory site Secunia reported 24 unpatched vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer 6 as of February 9, 2010. These vulnerabilities, which include several \"moderately critical\" ratings, amount to 17% of the total 144 security risks listed on the website as of February 11, 2010.\n\nAs of June 23, 2006, Secunia counted 20 unpatched security flaws for Internet Explorer 6, many more and older than for any other browser, even in each individual criticality-level, although some of these flaws only affect Internet Explorer when running on certain versions of Windows or when running in conjunction with certain other applications.\n\nOn June 23, 2004, an attacker used two previously undiscovered security holes in Internet Explorer to insert spam-sending software on an unknown number of end-user computers. This malware became known as Download.ject and caused users to infect their computers with a back door and key logger merely by viewing a web page. Infected sites included several financial sites.\n\nProbably the biggest generic security failing of Internet Explorer (and other web browsers too) is the fact that it runs with the same level of access as the logged in user, rather than adopting the principle of least user access. Consequently, any malware executing in the Internet Explorer process via a security vulnerability (e.g. Download.ject in the example above) has the same level of access as the user, something that has particular relevance when that user is an Administrator. Tools such as DropMyRights are able to address this issue by restricting the security token of the Internet Explorer process to that of a limited user. However this added level of security is not installed or available by default, and does not offer a simple way to elevate privileges ad hoc when required (for example to access Microsoft Update).\n\nArt Manion, a representative of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) noted in a vulnerability report that the design of Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 made it difficult to secure. He stated that:\nManion later clarified that most of these concerns were addressed in 2004 with the release of Windows XP Service Pack 2, and other browsers had begun to suffer the same vulnerabilities he identified in the above CERT report.\n\nIn response to a belief that Internet Explorer's frequency of exploitation is due in part to its ubiquity, since its market dominance made it the most obvious target, David Wheeler argues that this is not the full story. He notes that Apache HTTP Server had a much larger market share than Microsoft IIS, yet Apache traditionally had fewer security vulnerabilities at the time.\n\nAs a result of its issues, some security experts, including Bruce Schneier in 2004, recommended that users stop using Internet Explorer for normal browsing, and switch to a different browser instead. Several notable technology columnists suggested the same idea, including \"The Wall Street Journal\"s Walt Mossberg and eWeek's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. On July 6, 2004, US-CERT released an exploit report in which the last of seven workarounds was to use a different browser, especially when visiting untrusted sites.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 was the most widely used web browser during its tenure (surpassing Internet Explorer 5.x), attaining a peak percentage in usage share during 2002 and 2003 in the high 80s, and together with other versions up to 95%. It only slowly declined up to 2007, when it lost about half its market share to Internet Explorer 7 and Mozilla Firefox between late 2006 to 2008.\n\nIE6 remained more popular than its successor in business use for more than a year after IE7 came out. A 2008 DailyTech article noted, \"A Survey found 55.2% of companies still use IE 6 as of December 2007\", while \"IE 7 only has a 23.4 percent adoption rate\".\n\nNet Applications estimated IE6 market share at almost 39% for September 2008. According to the same source, IE7 users migrate faster to IE8 than users of its predecessor IE6 did, leading to IE6 once again becoming the most widely used browser during the summer and fall of 2009, eight years after its introduction.\n\nAs of February 2010, estimates of IE6's global market share ranged from 10-20%. Nonetheless, IE6 continued to maintain a plurality or even majority presence in the browser market of certain countries, notably China and South Korea.\n\nGoogle Apps and YouTube dropped support for IE6 in March 2010, followed by Facebook chat in September.\n\nOn January 3, 2012, Microsoft announced that usage of IE6 in the United States had dropped below 1%.\n\nIn August 2012, IE6 was still the most popular IE web browser in China. It was also the second most used browser overall with a total market share of 22.41%, just behind the Chinese-made 360 Secure Browser at 26.96%.\n\nIn July 2013, Net Applications reported the global market share of IE6 amongst all Internet Explorer browsers to be 10.9%.\n\nAs of August 2015, IE6 was being used by <1% users in most countries, with the only exception being China (3.1%). Usage in China fell below 1% by the end of the year.\n\nA common criticism of Internet Explorer is the speed at which fixes are released after the discovery of security problems.\n\nMicrosoft attributes the perceived delays to rigorous testing. A posting to the Internet Explorer team blog on August 17, 2004 explained that there are, at minimum, 234 distinct releases of Internet Explorer that Microsoft supports (covering more than two dozen languages, and several different revisions of the operating system and browser level for each language), and that every combination is tested before a patch is released.\n\nIn May 2006, PC World rated Internet Explorer 6 the eighth worst tech product of all time. A certain degree of complacency has been alleged against Microsoft over IE6. With near 90% of the browser market the motive for innovation was not strongly present, resulting in the 5 year time between IE6's introduction and its replacement with IE7. This was a contributing factor for the rapid rise of the free software alternative Mozilla Firefox.\n\nUnlike most other modern browsers, IE6 does not fully nor properly support CSS version 2, which made it difficult for web developers to ensure compatibility with the browser without degrading the experience for users of more advanced browsers. Developers often resorted to strategies such as CSS hacks, conditional comments, or other forms of browser sniffing to make their websites work in IE6.\n\nAdditionally, IE6 lacks support for alpha transparency in PNG images, replacing transparent pixels with a solid colour background (grey unless defined in a PNG bKGD chunk). There is a workaround by way of Microsoft's proprietary AlphaImageLoader, but it is more complicated and not wholly comparable in function.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 has also been criticized due to its instability. For example, the following code on a website would cause a program crash in IE6:\n\n<style>*{position:relative}</style><table><input></table>\nor\n<script>for (x in open);</script>\n\nThe user could crash the browser with a single line of code in the address bar, causing a pointer overflow.\n\nms-its:%F0:\nSeveral campaigns were later aimed at ridding Internet Explorer 6 from the browser market:\n\n\nWith the increasing lack of compatibility with modern web standards, popular websites began removing support for IE6 in 2010, including YouTube and their parent company Google; however large IT company support teams and other employers forcing staff to use IE6 for compatibility reasons slowed upgrades. Microsoft themselves eventually began their own campaign to encourage users to stop using IE6, though stating that they would support IE6 until Windows XP SP3 (including embedded versions) support is removed. However, on January 12, 2016 when the new Microsoft Lifecycle Support policy for Internet Explorer went into effect, IE6 support on all Windows versions ended, more than 14 years after its original release, making the January 2016 security update for multiple versions of XP Embedded the last that Microsoft publicly issued for IE6.\n\nInternet Explorer uses a zone-based security framework, which means that sites are grouped based upon certain conditions. IE allows the restriction of broad areas of functionality, and also allows specific functions to be restricted. The administration of Internet Explorer is accomplished through the Internet Properties control panel. This utility also administers the Internet Explorer framework as it is implemented by other applications.\n\nPatches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through Windows Update web site. Windows XP Service Pack 2 adds several important security features to Internet Explorer, including a popup blocker and additional security for ActiveX controls. ActiveX support remains in Internet Explorer although access to the \"Local Machine Zone\" is denied by default since Service Pack 2. However, once an ActiveX control runs and is authorized by the user, it can gain all the privileges of the user, instead of being granted limited privileges as Java or JavaScript do. This was later solved in the Windows Vista version of IE 7, which supported running the browser in a low-permission mode, making malware unable to run unless expressly granted permission by the user.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 dropped \"Compatibility Mode\", which allowed Internet Explorer 4 to be run side by side with 5.x. Instead, IE6 introduced quirks mode, which causes it to emulate many behaviors of IE 5.5. Rather than being activated by the user, quirks mode is automatically and silently activated when viewing web pages that contain an old, invalid or no DOCTYPE. This feature was later added to all other major browsers to maximize compatibility with old or poorly-coded web pages.\n\nInternet Explorer 6.0 supports Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 6a only), Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. The Service Pack 1 update supports all of these versions, but Security Version 1 is only available as part of Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and later service packs for those versions.

This game is a widebody pinball game with several unique twists. Among them, is an old fashioned revolver, which players use to start the game as opposed to the typical plunger. When a quarter is inserted, the band's famous \"Welcome to the Jungle\" song (recorded from a concert) plays. Also included on the soundtrack is the \"Use Your Illusion\" outtake \"Ain't Going Down,\" which is the only official release of the song. The backdrop is illuminated with lights in the shape of the famous Guns N' Roses seal, and Axl Rose's tattoos, featured in the \"Appetite for Destruction\" album artwork. The multi-ball can be activated when the yellow light is lit on the G ramp, this will open a trap door and send the ball into the snake pit (if the ball is shot up the ramp which is a hard shot), pulling the rose plunger will then activate the multi-ball. An \"R\" ramp is also featured completing the \"GN'R\" logo. The game play is a mode-based game not unlike that of \"The Addams Family\", \"Jurassic Park\", or \"Tommy\". The machine also uses magnets as ball stoppers, a feature that was used previously on \"The Addams Family\", and a video mode for extra points.\n\nNo longer in production, this machine is now a hot item on online auction sites and second hand arcade stores. This is one of the most popular pinball machines from Data East.\n\nFormer Guns N' Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke sued the band over the use of his likeness in the game, as he had been a member of the band when the machine was under production but was out by the time it was released.\n\n"}
{"id": "1956391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956391", "title": "Hug machine", "text": "Hug machine\n\nA hug machine, also known as a hug box, a squeeze machine, or a squeeze box, is a deep-pressure device designed to calm hypersensitive persons, usually individuals with autism spectrum disorders. The therapeutic, stress-relieving device was invented by Temple Grandin while she was attending college.\n\nAutism disorders have profound effects upon both social interactions and sensitivity to sensory stimulation in persons with such conditions, often making it uncomfortable or impractical for them to turn to other human beings for comfort. Grandin addressed this by designing the hug machine for sensory relief.\n\nThe hug machine consists of two hinged side-boards, each four by three feet (120 cm by 90 cm) with thick soft padding, which form a V-shape, with a complex control box at one end and heavy-duty tubes leading to an air compressor. The user lies or squats, between the side-boards, for as long or short a period as desired. Using pressure exerted by the air compressor and controlled by the user, the side-boards apply deep pressure stimulation evenly across the lateral parts of the body. The machine and its development are depicted in the biopic \"Temple Grandin\".\n\nAs a young child, Grandin realized she would seek out deep pressure stimulation, but she felt over-stimulated when someone hugged or held her. The idea for the hug machine came to her during a visit to her aunt's Arizona ranch, where she noted the way cattle were confined in a squeeze chute for inoculation, and how some of the cattle immediately calmed down after pressure was administered. She realized that the deep pressure from the chute had a calming effect on the cattle, and she decided that something similar might well settle down her own hypersensitivity.\n\nInitially, Grandin's device met with disapproval as psychologists at her college sought to confiscate her prototype hug machine. Her science teacher, however, encouraged her to determine the reason it helped resolve the anxiety and sensory issues.\n\nSeveral therapy programs in the United States now use hug machines, effectively achieving general calming effects among both children and adults with autism. A 1995 study on the efficacy of Grandin's device, conducted by the Center for the Study of Autism, working with Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, involved ten children with autism and found a reduction in tension and anxiety. Other studies, including one by Dr. Margaret Creedon, have yielded similar results. A small pilot study published in the \"American Journal of Occupational Therapy\" reported that the machine produced a significant reduction in tension, but only a small decrease in anxiety.\n\nGrandin continued to use her own hug box on a regular basis to provide the deep pressure necessary to relieve symptoms of her anxiety. \"I concentrate on how gently I can do it,\" she has said. A paper Grandin wrote on her hug machine and the effects of deep pressure stimulation was published in the \"Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology\".\n\nIn a February 2010 \"Time\" magazine interview, Grandin stated that she no longer uses a hug machine: \"It broke two years ago, and I never got around to fixing it. I'm into hugging people now.\"\n\nFor several years in the 1990s, urban interventionist/artist Wendy Jacob worked with Grandin in developing furniture that squeezes or \"hugs\" users, inspired by Grandin's hug machine.\n\nSeveral compression garments are available to treat noise phobia in dogs.\n\n"}
{"id": "1956394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956394", "title": "Internet Explorer 5", "text": "Internet Explorer 5\n\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer 5 (IE5) is a graphical web browser and one of the main participants of the first browser war. Its distribution methods and Windows integration were involved in the \"United States v. Microsoft Corp.\" case. It is included with Windows 98 SE and Windows Me and it is the last version of Internet Explorer compatible with Windows 3.1x, Windows NT 3.x and Windows 95. Although Internet Explorer 5 ran only on Windows, its siblings Internet Explorer for Mac 5 and Internet Explorer for UNIX 5 supported Mac OS X, Solaris and HP-UX.\n\nIE5 presided over a large market share increase over Netscape Navigator between 1999 and 2001, and offered many advanced features for its day. In addition, it was compatible with the largest range of OSes of all the IE versions. However, support for many OSes quickly dropped off with later patches, and Windows XP and later Windows versions are not supported, because of inclusion of later IE versions. The 1999 review in \"PC World\" noted, \"\"Credit the never-ending game of browser one-upsmanship that Netscape and Microsoft play. The new IE 5 trumps Netscape Communicator with smarter searching and accelerated browsing.\"\"\n\nIE5 attained over 50% market share by early 2000, taking the lead over other browser versions including IE4 and Netscape. 5.x versions attained over 80% market share by the release of IE6 in August 2001. 5.0x and 5.5 were surpassed by Internet Explorer 6.0, dropping it to the second most popular browser, with market share dropping to 34 percent by mid-2003. In addition, Firefox 1.0 had overtaken it in market share by early 2005. Market share of IE5 fell below 1% by the end of 2006.\n\nMicrosoft spent over US$100 million a year in the late 1990s, with over 1000 people working on IE by 1999 during the development of IE5.\n\nThe rendering behavior of Internet Explorer 5.x lives on in other browsers' quirks modes. Internet Explorer 5 is no longer available for download from Microsoft. However, archived versions of the software can be found on various websites.\n\nThe actual release of Internet Explorer 5 happened in three stages. First, a Developer Preview was released in June 1998 (5.0B1), and then a Public Preview was released in November 1998 (5.0B2). Then in March 1999 the final release was released (5.0). In September it was released with Windows 98 Second Edition. Version 5.01, a bug fix version, was released in December 1999. Windows 2000 includes this version. Version 5.0 was the last one to be released for Windows 3.1x or Windows NT 3.x. Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition had been released a few months earlier on March 27, 2000, and was the last version of Internet Explorer to be released on a non-Windows platform. Version 5.5 for Windows was released in July 2000, bundled with Windows Me and 128-bit encryption. It dropped support for several older Windows versions.\n\nA 1999 review of IE5 by Paul Thurrott described IE5 in ways such as, \"\"Think of IE 5.0 as IE 4.0 done right: All of the rough areas have been smoothed out..\", \"...comes optionally bundled with a full suite of Internet applications that many people are going to find irresistible.\", \"IE 5.0 is a world-class suite of Internet applications.\"\"\n\nMicrosoft ended all support for Internet Explorer 5.5, including security updates, on December 31, 2005. Microsoft continued to support Internet Explorer 5.01 on Windows 2000 SP4, according to its Support Lifecycle Policy; however, as with Windows 2000, this support was ended on July 13, 2010.\n\nVersion 5.0, launched on March 18, 1999, and subsequently included with Windows 98 Second Edition and bundled with Microsoft Office 2000, was a significant release that supported bi-directional text, ruby characters, XML, XSLT and the ability to save web pages in MHTML format. There was enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The first release of Windows 98 in 1998 had included IE4. However, Internet Explorer 5 incorrectly includes the padding and borders within a specified width or height; this results in a narrower or shorter rendering of a box. The bug was fixed in Internet Explorer 6 when running in standards-compliant mode.\n\nWith the release of Internet Explorer 5.0, Microsoft released the first version of XMLHttpRequest (XHR), giving birth to Ajax (even though the term \"Ajax\" was not coined until years later.) XMLHttpRequest is an API that can be used by JavaScript, and other Web browser scripting languages to transfer XML and other text data between a page's client side and server side, and was available since the introduction of Internet Explorer 5.0 and is accessible via JScript, VBScript and other scripting languages supported by IE browsers. Windows Script Host was also installed with IE5, although later on viruses and malware would attempt to use this ability as an exploit, which resulted pressure to disable it for security reasons. Smart Offline Favorites feature was added to the Active Desktop component introduced in IE4.\n\nAn \"HTML Application\" (HTA) is a Microsoft Windows application written with HTML and Dynamic HTML and introduced with IE5. Internet Explorer 5.0 also introduced favicon support and Windows Script Host, which provides scripting capabilities comparable to batch files, but with a greater range of supported features.\n\nVersion 5.5 followed in July 2000. First released to developers at the 2000 Professional Developers Conference in Orlando, Florida, then made available for download, version 5.5 focused on improved print preview capabilities, CSS and HTML standards support, and developer APIs; this version was bundled with Windows Me. Version 5.5 also includes support for 128-bit encryption. Although it is no longer available for download from Microsoft directly it can also be installed with MSN Explorer 6.0 as msnsetup_full.exe. The full version of MSN Explorer can be downloaded only if you use Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 if Internet Explorer 5.5 has not yet been installed. The full version will work on also Windows Me and Windows XP but you will need to download it on Windows 2000 or earlier and transfer the setup file to the newer operating system. If you still want to download it on a newer operating system the only way is to use an outdated web browser such as Netscape 4.8.\n\nAlthough newer browsers have been released, IE5 rendering mode continues to have an impact, as a 2008 Ars Technica article notes:\n\nOn April 3, 2000, Judge Jackson issued his \"findings of fact\" that Microsoft had abused its monopoly position by attempting to \"dissuade Netscape from developing Navigator as a platform\", that it \"withheld crucial technical information\", and attempted to reduce Navigator's usage share by \"giving Internet Explorer away and rewarding firms that helped build its usage share\" and \"excluding Navigator from important distribution channels\".\n\nJackson also released a \"remedy\" that suggested Microsoft should be broken up into two companies. This remedy was overturned on appeal, amidst charges that Jackson had revealed a bias against Microsoft in communication with reporters. The findings of fact that Microsoft had broken the law, however, were upheld. The Department of Justice announced on September 6, 2001 that it was no longer seeking to break up Microsoft and would instead seek a lesser antitrust penalty. Several months later the Department of Justice agreed on a settlement agreement with Microsoft. , although nineteen states have agreed to the settlement, Massachusetts was still holding out.\n\nIE5 introduced many new or improved features:\n\n\nIE5 for Windows came with Windows Media Player 6.0 (with new Real Audio codecs), NetMeeting 2.11, Chat 2.5 and FrontPage Express 2.0. Other optional installs included Offline Browsing Pack, Internet Explorer Core Web Fonts, and Visual Basic Scripting (VBScript) support. Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and 5.5 are no longer available from Microsoft.\n\nInternet Explorer 5.01 is the last version to support Windows 3.1x, Windows NT 3.x, Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3 or later). Support for 3.1x and NT 3.x was dropped after that, as well as support for HP-UX, Solaris, the classic Mac OS, and Mac OS X. Windows 2000 was the last to support IE 5.0 (with which it was released) well after support in other Windows systems was deprecated. IE 5.5 SP2 is the last for Windows 95. In addition, users of Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0 SP6a, and Windows 2000 could upgrade to IE 6.0 SP1. IE5 was not developed for 68k Macs, support for which had been dropped in Internet Explorer 4.5.\n\n\n\nInternet Explorer 5 for Apple Macintosh requirements:\n\n\nEarly versions of Mac OS X shipped with Internet Explorer for Mac v5.1 as the default web browser, only until Mac OS X 10.2, where the default web browser in Mac OS X Panther is Safari.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1956397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956397", "title": "Internet Explorer 4", "text": "Internet Explorer 4\n\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer 4 (IE4) is a graphical web browser that Microsoft released in October 1997, primarily for Microsoft Windows, but also with versions available for the classic Mac OS, Solaris, and HP-UX and marketed as \"The Web the Way You Want It\".\n\nIt was one of the main participants of the first browser war. Its distribution methods and Windows integration were involved in the \"United States v. Microsoft Corp.\" case. It was superseded by Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 in March 1999. Version 4.0 was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2.5 and 4.01 in Windows 98 First Edition (Windows 98 Second Edition would include IE 5.0); in addition the Internet Explorer layout engine Trident was introduced. It attained just over 60% market share by March 1999 when IE5 was released. In August 2001 when Internet Explorer 6 was released, IE4.x had dropped to 7% market share and IE5 had increased to 80%. IE4 market share dropped under 1% by 2004.\n\nThe Internet Explorer 4.0 Platform Preview was released in April 1997, and Platform Preview 2.0 in July that year. Internet Explorer 4 was released to the public in September, 1997 and deepened the level of integration between the web browser and the underlying operating system. Installing version 4 on a Windows 95 or Windows NT 4 machine and choosing \"Windows Desktop Update\" would result in the traditional Windows Explorer being replaced by a version more akin to a web browser interface, as well as the Windows desktop itself being web-enabled via Active Desktop. The integration with Windows, however, was subject to numerous packaging criticisms (see United States v. Microsoft). This option was no longer available with the installers for later versions of Internet Explorer but was not removed from the system if already installed. Internet Explorer 4 introduced support for Group Policy, allowing companies to configure and lock down many aspects of the browser's configuration. Internet Mail and News was replaced with Outlook Express, and Microsoft Chat and an improved NetMeeting were also included. This version also was included with Windows 98. Version 4.5 (only for Mac) dropped support for 68k Macs, but offered new features such as easier 128-bit encryption. The last non-Mac version, was 4.0 Service Pack 2, however. Uninstalling IE4 became the subject of concern to some users and was a point of contention in later lawsuits (see Removal of Internet Explorer and United States v. Microsoft.)\n\nOn January 6, 1998, at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco, Microsoft announced the release of the final version of \"Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Macintosh\". Version 4 included support for offline browsing, Dynamic HTML, a new faster Java virtual machine and Security Zones that allow users or administrators to limit access to certain types of web content depending on which zone (for example Intranet or Internet) the content was coming from. At the same event, Apple announced the release of Mac OS 8.1, which would be bundled with IE4.\n\nAt the following year's San Francisco Macworld Expo on January 9, 1999, Microsoft announced the release of \"Internet Explorer 4.5 Macintosh Edition\". This new version, which dropped 68K processor support, introduced Form AutoFill, Print Preview, the Page Holder pane which let a user hold a page of links on one side of the screen that opened pages in the right hand and support for Mac OS technology like Sherlock.\n\nOn November 5, 1997 a beta of IE for Unix 4.0 was released for testing on Solaris. On January 27, 1998 it was reported that IE 4.0 for Solaris was due in March; Tod Nielsen, general manager of Microsoft's developer relations group, joked that \"he wanted to launch Internet Explorer 4.0 for Unix at the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum in San Francisco\" because of skepticism from those who suspected IE for Unix was vaporware. It was further reported that versions for \"HP-UX, IBM AIX, and Irix\" were planned. The software used to enable this, MainWin XDE, was available for Solaris 2.5.1 on SPARC and Intel, SunOS 4.1.4, Irix 5.3, Irix 6.2, HP UX 10.2, and IBM AIX 4.1.5.\nOn March 4, 1998 IE 4.0 for Unix on Solaris was released. Later that year, a version for HP-UX was released.\n\nIE4 came with Active Desktop, Windows Desktop Update, Channels, Frontpage Express, Netmeeting, NetShow, Web Publishing Wizard, Microsoft Chat 2.0 and Progressive Networks RealPlayer. Outlook Express 4 replaced Internet Mail and News.\n\nOther new features including Dynamic HTML, inline PNG, Favicons, a parental rating system, and the ability to 'subscribe' to a website in favorites, where it would notify the user of an update. Stephen Reid of PC Pro noted in his review:\n\n\nActive Desktop is a feature of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0's optional Windows Desktop Update that allows the user to add HTML content to the desktop, along with some other features. This functionality was intended to be installed on the then-current Windows 95 operating system, and later Windows 98. Active Desktop placed a number of \"channels\" on the user's computer desktop that provided continually-updated information, such as news headlines and stock quotes, without requiring the user to open a Web browser.\n\nActive Channel is a website type which allows synchronizing website content and viewing it offline. It makes use of the Channel Definition Format, which is a way of defining a website's content and structure. Each country had different channels, so picking a country during the installation of IE 4 (and therefore Windows 98) was important. Channels could be displayed in a Channel Bar and made heavy use of Dynamic HTML.\n\nWindows Desktop Update was an optional feature included with Internet Explorer 4, which provided several updated shell features later introduced with the Windows 98 operating system for older versions of Microsoft Windows. The Windows Desktop Update also added the ability to create desk-bands like the quicklaunch bar. It also updated the Windows file manager, explorer.exe (also a shell), to be more modular and extensible.\n\nTrident (MSHTML) was a layout engine introduced with IE4. It was designed as a software component to allow software developers to easily add web browsing functionality to their own applications. It presents a COM interface for accessing and editing web pages in any COM-supported environment, like C++ and .NET. For instance, a web browser control can be added to a C++ program and Trident can then be used to access the page currently displayed in the web browser and retrieve element values. Events from the web browser control can also be captured. Trident functionality becomes available by connecting the file mshtml.dll to the software project.\n\nA Browser Helper Object (BHO) is a DLL module designed as a plugin for Internet Explorer 4.0, and provides added functionality. Most BHOs are loaded once by each new instance of Internet Explorer.\n\nInternet Explorer 4.0 had support for Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 3.x, and Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3 or later). Version 4.0 was included in the first release of Windows 98, although the second edition included IE5. HP-UX, Solaris, and Mac OS were also supported. IE4 supported 68k Macs, although this was dropped in Internet Explorer 4.5.\n\nFor Windows, Initially Windows 95 or above, 16MB of RAM, 11MB of disk space (minimum for install).\n\nSystem Requirements for initial release of 4.0 for Mac:\n\n\nIE 4.5 did not support 68k Macs.\n\nInternet Explorer 4 was the first version of the browser to support TLS 1.0. Internet Explorer 4 supported 40-bit and later 128-bit encryption through an add-on, using Server Gated Cryptography (SGC). 256-bit encryption would not become available in IE for nearly 10 years until the Windows Vista version of Internet Explorer 7.\n\n128-bit encryption was available or included for these versions:\n\nIf it was not possible to upgrade to 128-bit, then 40-bit (SGC) was standard.\n\nMac OS:\n\n\nShdocvw.dll version numbers plus related notes. \"major version.minor version.build number.sub-build number\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1956399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956399", "title": "Internet Explorer 3", "text": "Internet Explorer 3\n\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer 3 (IE3) is a graphical web browser released on August 13, 1996 by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows and on January 8, 1997 for Apple Mac OS (see IE for Mac). It began serious competition against Netscape Navigator in the first Browser war. It was Microsoft's first browser release with a major internal development component. It was the first more widely used version of Internet Explorer, although it did not surpass Netscape or become the browser with the most market share. During its tenure, IE market share went from roughly 3–9% in early 1996 to 20–30% by the end of 1997. In September 1997 it was superseded by Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.\n\nIE3 was the first commercial browser with Cascading Style Sheets support. It introduced support for ActiveX controls, Java applets, inline multimedia, and the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) system for content metadata. This version was the first version of Internet Explorer to use the blue 'e' logo, which later became a symbol of the browser. Version 3 came bundled with Internet Mail and News, NetMeeting, and an early version of the Windows Address Book, and was itself included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2. There were 16-bit and 32-bit versions depending on the OS.\n\nThis is the first version of Internet Explorer developed without Spyglass source code, but still used Spyglass technology, so the Spyglass licensing information remained in the program's documentation. In 1996 Microsoft said of its new browser \"\"Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 adds many new features which are great for HTML authors and demonstrates our accelerating commitment to W3C HTML standards.\"\"\n\nInternet Explorer 3 is no longer supported, and is not available for download from Microsoft.\n\nInternet Explorer 3.0 was released free of charge on the August 13, 1996 by bundling it with Windows 95 OSR2, another OEM release. Microsoft thus made no direct revenues on IE and was liable to pay Spyglass only the minimum quarterly fee. In 1997, Spyglass threatened Microsoft with a contractual audit, in response to which Microsoft settled for $8 million U.S. Version 3 included Internet Mail and News 1.0 and the Windows Address Book. It brought the browser much closer to the bar that had been set by Netscape, including the support of Netscape's plugins technology (NPAPI), ActiveX, frames, and a reverse-engineered version of JavaScript named JScript. Later, Microsoft NetMeeting and Windows Media Player were integrated into the product and thus helper applications became not as necessary as they once were. CSS were introduced with version 3 of Internet Explorer. While IE1 and IE2 were said have \"paled\" in comparison to Netscape, IE3 \"delivers a crushing blow to Netscape\". The user interface notably changes, with much larger buttons, with more intricate icons, and with a light gray design behind it. Unlike later IE versions, users who upgraded to IE3 could still use the last IE by converting the previous version to a separate directory. It could import favorites into IE3 from IE1 or 2. The competition between Netscape and Microsoft heated up, with some saying the Internet community \"became polarized on the issue of which web browser had the most features.\" Other new features included ActiveMovie multimedia API, HTML Layout Control, Quick Links toolbar, VRML.\n\nMicrosoft announced on July 29, 1996 that it would develop a native version of IE for \"Solaris and other popular variants of UNIX\" to be available \"by the end of 1996\" which would have \"equivalent functionality as that provided in Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0\", thus \"delivering on its commitment to provide full-featured Web browser support on all major operating system platforms\" as well as \"supporting and promoting open standards, including HTML, ActiveX and Java\". In March, 1997 following a dispute which \"arose between Microsoft and Bristol concerning each other's performance of the 1996 IE Agreement\" and likely because of contract negotiations with Bristol to access Windows source code after September 1997 failing, Microsoft reversed course and decided to directly port the Windows version in-house using the MainWin XDE (eXtended Development Environment) application from Mainsoft, the main competitor to Bristol Technology. (Microsoft would later use MainWin to port Windows Media Player and Outlook Express to Unix.) Now well behind schedule, the 3.0 branch was apparently scrapped in favor of 4.0 (that was released for Windows half a year earlier), which used the new Trident rendering engine. An Internet Explorer 4 Beta for Solaris was released by the end of 1997, leading to Internet Explorer for UNIX versions, which lasted until Internet Explorer 5.\n\nBackwards compatibility was handled by allowing Users who upgraded to IE3 to still use the last IE, because the installation converted the previous version to separate directory.\n\nThe Princeton Word Macro Virus Loophole was discovered on August 22, 1996, nine days after Internet Explorer 3's release, which could allow Webmasters to cause an end-user's computer to initiate downloads without their consent via a backdoor. Microsoft patched the vulnerability the following day; however, researchers went on to find more vulnerabilities and new types of problems, such as the ability to spoof a website (similar to the later phishing problem), with these issues triggering public concern over browser security. In early 1997, Microsoft released IE 3.02 as an update to fix most of the discovered security problems.\n\nMicrosoft Authenticode became inoperable on June 30, 1997, when its trust anchor expired. After this, IE users needed to upgrade to Authenticode 2.0 which required at least IE 3.02. Authenticode is a code signing technology.\n\n\"Internet Explorer 3 for Macintosh\" was released on January 8, 1997 for PPC, and added support for the SSL and NTLM security protocols and the PICS and RSACi rating systems that can be used to control access to websites based on content ratings. On November 5, 1996 Microsoft announced the release of a beta version for Mac of Internet Explorer version 3.0. This release added support for HTML version 3.2, CSS, Java applets and ActiveX controls. Keith Mitchell of Macworld noted in November 1996, when discussing the IE mac version, \"\"With the near-simultaneous release of Netscape Navigator 3.0 (415/528-2555, <nowiki>http://www.netscape.com</nowiki>) and Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 (206/882-8080, <nowiki>http://www.microsoft.com</nowiki>), both companies are tripping over each other to entice Web users to their products.\"\"\nA problem with an operating system extension used in the Mac OS called CFM68K Runtime Enabler, led to a delay in the release of the version 3.0 for Macs based on the 68k line of processors. Four months later on May 14, Microsoft released version 3.01 which included a version for 68k-based machines. This version included features from the Windows version of Internet Explorer 4.0 such as AutoComplete and Monitoring Favorites that notified users when sites in their Favorites list have been updated. It included support for JavaScript and introduced a Download Manager and a Cookie Manager. The download manager was introduced in version 3.01; version 3.0 would open the download progress bar in the main browser window, forcing the user to either cancel the download and restart it in a new window, or wait for the transfer to complete. MacUser's review noted \"\"While Netscape Navigator 3.0 is more feature-laden and consequently bigger and slower than previous incarnations, Microsoft Internet Explorer has been refined and optimised into a Web browser that has almost as many features, but is both smaller and faster than its rival.\"\"\n\nIE3 launched with a variety of integrated apps. The following is a list of those apps and a brief description for each.\n\n\nLater versions of Internet Explorer 3 included the following:\n\nIE3 also included Microsoft Java Virtual Machine, which continued to be included until IE5.5. Because of a legal battle between Sun Microsystems (the developer of Java), Microsoft stopped offering it in 2001, although it was supported for several years after this (until the end of 2007).\n\nInternet Explorer 3.0 runs on Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51, and Windows NT 4.0. Version 3.0 was included in Windows 95 OSR2, but Windows 98 launched with IE4. Major Microsoft's OS releases after Windows 98, switched to supporting Internet Explorer 4 (or higher). Internet Explorer 3 had a Beta supporting Solaris (UNIX). IE4 integration with the OS meant systems that upgraded from Internet Explorer 3 to 4.0, or came with 4.0, could not easily revert to IE3 (see Removal of Internet Explorer). The Mac OS version supported PPC and 68k Macs, superseding IE 2.1. Microsoft released various 16- and 32-bit versions for Windows.\n\nInternet Explorer 3.03, and subsequently 3.03 Service Pack 1, were released for IE3 after the launch of Internet Explorer 4.0.

It was released on November 22, 1995, for Windows 95 and Windows NT, and on April 23, 1996, for Apple Macintosh and Windows 3.1.\n\nVersion 2 launched with 12 languages, including English, but this would expand to 24 for Windows 95, 20 for Windows 3.1, and 9 for the Macintosh by April 1996. It lacked many features that became common in later IE versions, including the Blue 'e' logo, integration with Windows Explorer, and bundled programs. Its market share was also much lower than later versions. During its tenure, IE market share only went up to about roughly 3-9% by mid 1996, before Internet Explorer 3 was released.\n\nInternet Explorer 2 is no longer supported, and is not available for download from Microsoft.\n\nIE replicated many of the quirks of Netscape Navigator, and allowed importing bookmarks from it. In May 1996 FTP Software announced it was providing Microsoft with various technology for Internet Explorer 2.0 for Windows 3.1, including a PPP network, 16-bit email client, and other technology.\n\nInternet Explorer version 2 was released in beta in October 1995, only 2 months after version 1 came out in Microsoft Plus! for 95 that August. It was released for Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5 in November 1995 and was bundled with NT 4.0 in July 1996. The Beta for Mac on PowerPC came out in January, and the finalized version in April for 68k and PowerPC. Version 2 was also the first release for Windows 3.1 and Macintosh System 7.0.1(PPC or 68k), although the Mac version was not released until January 1996 for PPC, and April for 68k. Version 2 was included in Windows 95 OEM Service Release (OSR 1) and Microsoft's \"Internet Starter Kit for Windows 95\" in early 1996. It launched with twelve languages, including English, but this expanded to 24, 20, and 9 for Win 95, Win 3.1 and Mac respectively by April 1996. The 2.0i version supported double-byte character-sets for supporting Chinese, Japanese or Korean characters in web pages. Version 2.1 for the Mac came out in August 1996, the same month version 2 for Windows was superseded by Microsoft Internet Explorer 3, which was heavily changed from version 2. There were 16-bit and 32-bit versions depending on the OS.\n\nThe Mac version, especially version 2.1, was praised for being economic with resources and for new features. Internet Explorer supported the embedding of a number of multimedia formats into web pages, including AVI and QuickTime formatted video and AIFF, MIDI and WAV formatted audio. The non-beta final version was released three months later on April 23, 1996. Version 2.1 fixed bugs and improving stability, but also added a few features such as support for the NPAPI (the first version of Internet Explorer on any platform to do so) and support for QuickTime VR. AOL 3.0 for Macintosh used the IE 2.1 rendering engine in its built-in web browser. The various 16 and 32 bit versions largely depended on the OS although Windows NT would use the 16 bit versions for Windows 3.1.\nIE2 introduced new or improved features for its time period.

{"id": "1956416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956416", "title": "Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)", "text": "Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)\n\nRenewable Energy Certificates (RECs), also known as Green tags, Renewable Energy Credits, Renewable Electricity Certificates, or Tradable Renewable Certificates (TRCs), are tradable, non-tangible energy commodities in the United States that represent proof that 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was generated from an eligible renewable energy resource (renewable electricity) and was fed into the shared system of power lines which transport energy. Solar renewable energy certificates (SRECs) are RECs that are specifically generated by solar energy. Renewable Energy Certificates provide a mechanism for the purchase of renewable energy that is added to and pulled from the electrical grid. The updated Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance guarantees of origin, RECs and I-RECs as mainstream instruments for documenting and tracking electricity consumed from renewable sources.\n\nThese certificates can be sold and traded or bartered, and the owner of the REC can claim to have purchased renewable energy. According to the U.S. Department of Energy's Green Power Network, RECs represent the environmental attributes of the power produced from renewable energy projects and are sold separately from commodity electricity. While conventional carbon emissions trading programs use penalties and incentives to achieve established emissions targets, RECs simply incentivize carbon-neutral renewable energy by providing a production subsidy to electricity generated from renewable sources.\n\nA green energy provider (such as a wind farm) is credited with one REC for every 1,000 kWh or 1 MWh of electricity it produces (for reference, an average residential customer consumes about 800 kWh in a month). A certifying agency gives each REC a unique identification number to make sure it doesn't get double-counted. The green energy is then fed into the electrical grid (by mandate), and the accompanying REC can then be sold on the open market. \"Retirement occurs when a Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) is used by the owner of the REC. Use of the REC may include, but is not limited to, (1) use of the REC by an end-use customer, marketer, generator, or utility to comply with a statutory or regulatory requirement, (2) a public claim associated with a purchase of RECs by an end-use customer, or (3) the sale of any component attributes of a REC for any purpose. Once a REC is retired, it may not be sold, donated, or transferred to any other party. No party other than the owner may make claims associated with retired RECs.\"\n\nEnergy from any grid-tied source is bought and sold with contracts specifying the generator and purchaser. In the trade of renewable energy, RECs specify that a unit of renewable energy was generated. Because once electricity is placed on the electrical grid it mixes with electricity from multiple sources and becomes indistinguishable, RECs are used to track the ownership of environmental and social benefits of the renewable energy. The majority of RECs are sold separately from the electricity itself. In these cases, the electricity is sold as \"null\" energy without its environmental and social benefits, as if it were generated by non-renewable resources such as coal or natural gas. When RECs are purchased in combination with non-renewable electricity this constitutes the legal purchase of renewable energy. This is how electrical grid connected renewable energy is traded in the U.S. Grid-connected renewable energy is used by electric utility companies in meeting their regulatory requirements and by individuals and businesses wishing to lessen their environmental impact. RECs allow for purchasers to support renewable energy generation and allow the economic forces of supply and demand to spur the further development of renewable energy generation.\n\nThere are two main markets for renewable energy certificates in the United States – compliance markets and voluntary markets.\n\nCompliance markets are created by a policy that exists in 29 U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, called Renewable Portfolio Standard. In these states, the electric companies are required to supply a certain percent of their electricity from renewable generators by a specified year. For example, in California the law is 33% renewable by 2020, whereas New York has a 24% requirement by 2013. Electric utilities in these states demonstrate compliance with their requirements by purchasing RECs; in the California example, the electric companies would need to hold RECs equivalent to 33% of their electricity sales.\n\nVoluntary markets are ones in which customers choose to buy renewable power out of a desire to use renewable energy. Most corporate and household purchases of renewable energy are voluntary purchases. Renewable energy generators located in states that do not have a Renewable Portfolio Standard can sell their RECs to voluntary buyers, usually at a cheaper price than compliance market RECs.\n\nRECs can be traded directly from buyer to seller, but third party marketers, brokers, or asset managers are commonly found in the marketplace. Renewable generation facilities will often sell their credits to these entities, who then resell them on the market at a later date.\n\nTexas developed the first comprehensive RECs system in the U.S., a web-based platform that provides for the issuance, registration, trade, and retirement of RECs. The Texas REC Program, which only tracks renewable energy certificates, started operating in July 2001.\n\nIn the Western United States RECs are traded on the Western Renewable Energy Generation Information System (WREGIS) as part of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). The WECC encompasses 14 states, 2 Canadian provinces, and the northern Baja Mexico. \n\nPrices depend on many factors, such as the vintage year the RECs were generated, location of the facility, whether there is a tight supply/demand situation, whether the REC is used for RPS compliance, even the type of power created. Solar renewable energy certificates or SRECs, for example, tend to be more valuable in the 16 states that have set aside a portion of the RPS specifically for solar energy. This differentiation is intended to promote diversity in the renewable energy mix which in an undifferentiated, competitive REC market, favors the economics and scale achieved by wind farms.\n\nIn the United States, spot prices for SRECs generally decreased from 2010 to 2014. In New Jersey, the spot price for a 2010 SREC was $665.04 in July 2010 and about $160 in May 2014 for SRECs generated in different years. In Delaware, the spot price for a 2010 SREC was $255 in July 2010 and about $50 in May 2014 for SRECs generated in different years. Rates for 2015 to 2017 RECS purchased have averaged between $0.15—$0.045 per kWh produced.\n\nIn Canada, 2008–09 BCHydro offers $3 /MWh for \"green attributes\", for long-term contracts, 20 plus years. Many Independent Power Producers (IPPs) believe that this is much less than \"fair market value\", but have no alternative.\n\nWhile the value of RECs fluctuate, most sellers are legally obligated to \"deliver\" RECs to their customers within a few months of their generation date. Other organizations will sell as many RECs as possible and then use the funds to guarantee a specific fixed price per MWh generated by a future wind farm, for example, making the building of the wind farm a financially viable prospect. The income provided by RECs, and a long-term stabilized market for tags can generate the additional incentive needed to build renewable energy plants.\n\nRECs are known under functionally equivalent names, such as Green Tags or Tradable Renewable Certificates (TRCs), depending on the market. The U.S. currently does not have a national registry of RECs issued. The Center for Resource Solutions administers a voluntary program which ensures that RECs are properly accounted for and that no double counting takes place. Under the Green-e Energy program, participants are required to submit to an annual Verification Process Audit of all eligible transactions to ensure the RECs meet the requirements for certification. The certification process requires 3rd party verification to be performed by an independent certified public accountant or a certified internal auditor. CRS maintains a list of auditors who meet the criteria to be listed on the program website. Increasingly RECs are being assigned unique ID numbers and tracked through regional tracking systems/registries such as WREGIS, NEPOOL, GATS, ERCOT, NYGATS, NAR, MIRECS, NC-RETS, NVTREC and M-RETS.\n\nThe following generation technologies qualify as producers of RECs:\n\n\"Additionality\" in the context of greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations means that a purchased renewable energy certificate introduces new renewable energy onto the electricity grid beyond what would have happened without the project or \"business as usual\". The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) favors performance based measures of additionality, such as the megawatt hour (MWh) equivalent per REC.\n\nWhereas air and water pollution travels across state and national boundaries irrespective of its origin, the value of RECs and the emergence of RECs markets depend very much on the markets created state by state through legislative action to mandate a Renewable Portfolio Standard. Such a balkanized approach to establishing RECs markets and incentives state by state creates issues of equity as some states could legitimately claim that their neighboring states (and their electricity consumers) with voluntary RPS are operating as free riders of pollution prevention, paid for by states (and their electricity consumers) with mandatory RPS. We can learn from EPA's SOx and NOx cap and trade program regarding how the principle of additionality with a national standard provided a benchmark for measuring and validating the commodification of pollution prevention credits that lead to market-driven initiatives with proven results in improving regional and national air quality.\n\nIn states with a Renewable Portfolio Standard, a RECs purchase enables the utility company to meet its minimum renewable electricity percentage without having to install that renewable generating capacity itself, regardless of the source of generating renewable energy. By analogy, in the EPA cap and trade program, a \"clean\" utility in one state can sell its NOx credits to a \"dirty\" utility in another state that would otherwise have to install additional smokestack scrubbers.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency claims to have the highest percentage use of green power of any federal agency. In 2007, it offset the electricity use of 100% of its offices. The Air Force is the largest purchaser in the US government in absolute terms, purchasing 899,142 MWh worth of RECs. Among colleges and universities, the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia is the largest purchaser of RECs, buying 192,727 MWh of RECs from wind power. The corporate leader is Intel, with 1,302,040 MWh purchased in 2007, and the largest purchaser among retailers is Whole Foods, which purchased 509,104 MWH, or enough RECs to offset 100% of its electricity needs.\n\nNote that research shows that RECs purchased and retired voluntarily in the United States (i.e., not for compliance with a Renewable Portfolio Standard) do not lead to any significant additional renewable energy investment or generation.\n\n"}

{"id": "1956458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956458", "title": "Separate peace", "text": "Separate peace\n\nA separate peace is a nation's agreement to cease military hostilities with another even though the former country had previously entered into a military alliance with other states that remain at war with the latter country. For example, at the start of World War I (1914–1918), Russia was a member, with the United Kingdom and France, of the Triple Entente, which went to war with the Central Powers formed by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. After the fall of Russian monarch Nicholas II and the rise to power of the Bolsheviks, Russia defaulted on its commitments to the Triple Entente by signing a separate peace with Germany and its allies in 1917. This armistice was followed on 3 March 1918 by the formal signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the Second World War, from 1941 when the Soviet Union entered into an alliance with the British and Americans until the end of the war in 1945, both sides suspected the other of seeking separate peace with Nazi Germany, though it did not happen. \n\nAn earlier important example is the Franco-Dutch War of 1672, which France and England entered together, but from which the English withdrew unilaterally in the 1674 Treaty of Westminster. \n\nIt is customary in cases of war waged by several allies to conclude agreement or declaration by all belligerents on the same side not to conclude a separate peace with the opposing camp. An example of such an undertaking was included in the alliance treaty concluded between the Papal States, the Duchy of Burgundy and the Republic of Venice, concluded in Rome on Oct. 19, 1463. The parties undertook to launch a crusade against the Turks and to refrain from making peace with the Sultan without the consent of all three parties. Such was the case during the First World War and Second World War.\n\nA declaration to that effect was issued on September 4, 1914 by the British, French and Russian governments, which briefly stated \n\nThe British, French, and Russian Governments mutually engage not to conclude peace separately during the present war. The three Governments agree that when terms of peace come to be discussed, no one of the allies will demand conditions of peace without the previous agreement of each of the other allies.\nThe Japanese government acceded to this declaration on October 19, 1915.\n\nOn November 30, 1915, the same four governments, now joined by the Italian government, issued a similar joint declaration regarding avoiding separate peace.\n\nThe obligation to refrain from separate peace was also made during the Second World War in both camps. The Tripartite Pact between the German, Italian and Japanese governments committed the three to prosecute the war together. On the Allied camp, that obligation was contained in the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942.\n\nA similar obligation arose within the Arab League in the context of the Arab-Israeli conflict not to reach any separate peace treaty with the Israeli government, in order to assure that a collective arrangement would take into consideration the interests of all Arab states plus the Palestinians. The Egyptian government under Anwar Sadat acted in contrast to that rule when it decided to conclude a separate peace treaty in 1979.\n"}

The Blades were also based in Kansas City, Missouri, at Kemper Arena.\nThe Outlaws began their lone season by winning back-to-back home games against cross-state rival Missouri River Otters on October 15 and October 16, 2004, and running up a 5-1 record in the first two weeks. From then on, the team's fortunes changed drastically, and the Outlaws finished last in the Western Division in 2004-2005 with a record of 28-45-7 (wins, losses and overtime losses).\n\nRob Schweyer was named the team's first captain, but when he left the team following an injury, Player/Assistant Coach Jason Ruff received the captain designation. Ruff went on to lead the Outlaws in scoring.\n\nStar players for the Outlaws included Ruff, goaltender Maxime Gingras, winger Joe Seroski, defenseman Matthieu Descoteaux, winger Jimmy Callahan and center Mark Lee. Lee started his professional tenure with the Outlaws, which jump started his career in the American Hockey League, and the ECHL.\n\nThe Outlaws were coached by Darryl Williams. Joe Bucchino, formerly of the Boston Bruin and New York Ranger organizations, served as General Manager. Richard Adler was the team President, responsible for day-to-day business operations.\n\nThe team had struggled to attract fans, as the reported attendance was \"around 2,800\" per game according to team officials.\n\nThe team played their final game, an 8-1 win over the Komets on April 10, 2005. Following the finale, it was reported three days later that a local printing company, Superior Color Graphics LLC, had filed a lawsuit for non-payment against the team. The lawsuit was reported to be in totaling $45,777.56. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed. Around this time rumors began to circulate the team would move to Toledo, Ohio the following season.\n\nOn April 15, 2005, the team suspended operations and officially folded, leaving Kansas City without a minor-pro hockey team once again.\n\nHockey is still popular in Kansas City. NHL exhibition games have been held in the city. The Missouri Mavericks of the ECHL now play in nearby Independence, MO at the Silverstein Eye Centers Arena. In 2007, the Sprint Center opened in downtown Kansas City, with the goal of landing an NHL or NBA team. While NHL teams have threatened to move to Kansas City, none have done so.\n\nSource:\n\n"}

They were a member of the United Hockey League from 1999 to 2007. The IceHogs played their home games at the MetroCentre. In 2007, the name and logo were purchased and applied to the current American Hockey League franchise. After the transfer of the name and logo to the AHL franchise was complete, the UHL IceHogs then ceased operations.\n\nThe IceHogs began play in October 1999. The team name, IceHogs, was selected during a \"name the team\" contest. The IceHogs were owned by Tri Vision Sports, LLC prior to acquisition by the Rockford MetroCentre. The team came into existence when United Sports Ventures (USV) bought out the rights of the Thunder Bay Thunder Cats franchise. The team originally joined the Colonial Hockey League in 1991 as the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks. On Oct. 23, 2002, Tri Vision Sports purchased the franchise from USV.\n\nDuring the 2006–07 season, the IceHogs played in the UHL's Western Division with the Quad City Mallards, Chicago Hounds, Bloomington Prairie Thunder, and Fort Wayne Komets. The IceHogs were coached by Steve Martinson, who helped lead the IceHogs to their best season in franchise history in 2005–06, his first behind the bench for the IceHogs. The IceHogs have also been named the 2004–05 and 2005–06 UHL Member Franchise of the Year for the club's success on and off the ice. The IceHogs won their first division championship in the 2005–06 season. The Ice Hogs won their first (and last) Colonial Cup in a hard fought game 7 at home on Thursday, May 24, 2007, by a score of 3 to 1 against the Kalamazoo Wings.\n\nThe IceHogs and Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League signed an affiliation agreement on December 13, 2005. The IceHogs supplied players to Nashville's primary affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League.\n\nEvery year the team held a \"Jersey Night\" during which the team wore a special, one-off alternate jersey and auctioned them off for charity. Many of the alternate jerseys were related to cultural icons such as Elvis Presley and St. Patrick's Day, or were autographed by Rockford-area celebrities such as Rick Nielsen.\n\nThe UHL IceHogs were replaced by an American Hockey League team of the same name for the 2007–08 season. The MetroCentre purchased the IceHogs name and logo from the prior ownership group and applied them to the new AHL franchise. The new team has also signed a 10-year player development contract with the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nUnited Hockey League (1999–2007) \nSeason results were compiled from hockeydb.com and Pointstreak.com.\n\n"}

The modern Flint Generals came about in the 1993–94 season after Flint Bulldogs owner Skip Probst moved the Bulldogs from Flint to Utica, New York. The following summer, Dr. Khaled M. Shukairy was granted an expansion franchise to play in Flint.\n\nAfter a fan vote, \"Generals\" had been voted on by the fans to be the name of the current franchise. Since their inception in 1993, Flint has won two Colonial Cup championships, the first against the Thunder Bay Senators in the 1995–96 season, in which the Generals claimed the Colonial Cup in a six-game upset where the Generals won the final game by a score of 9–0. This team included such players as Kevin Kerr, who would later break the all time minor league hockey scoring record and coach the Generals, Robin Bouchard, who was traded early the next season in a lopsided trade that did not favor the Generals, Andrei Mezin, the goalie who would go on to play for his native Belarus in the olympics and upset Sweden, and female goaltender, Erin Whitten.\n\nThe second Colonial Cup came in a 4–0 sweep of the Generals arch rival, the Quad City Mallards in 2000. The 2000 Flint Generals were coached by former NHLer Doug Shedden and included former Toronto Maple Leaf Bobby Reynolds, former Detroit Red Wing Mark Major, former Edmonton Oiler Nick Stajduhar, two 100 point scorers in Ross Wilson and Don Parsons, UHL Defenseman of the Year Gary Roach, high flying late season additions Cory Cyrenne and Vladmir Serov, and goalie Mark Richards. Serov and Cyrenne totaled 60 points in 37 regular season games, and in the 2000 finals, Serov scored the game-winning goal with 50 seconds left in game three, and the game-winning goal with 3:52 left in game four to preserve the victories for the Generals.\n\nAfter several years of mediocre hockey and questionable ownership, the Generals finished the 2009-10 season on a hot streak, clinching the final Turner Cup playoff berth on the final day of the season. The Generals faced the Muskegon Lumberjacks in Round One of the Turner Cup Playoffs, and after falling behind 3-1, came back to win the series in seven. The Generals then fell to the Fort Wayne Komets in a competitive five-game series. The Generals only win in the series was a thrilling 7-6 overtime win in Game 3.\n\nDespite the surprising turnaround in 2009-10 and rumors of more stable ownership taking over, the Generals folded when Perani Arena management decided to give the arena lease to the Michigan Warriors of the North American Hockey League.\n\n\"Legend\": OTL=Overtime loss, SOL=Shootout loss\n\n"}

The playwright was delighted with their adaptation, then entitled \"Faster Than Sound\", and agreed to direct it himself. \n\nOriginally, Coward had mentally cast Keith Michell as Charles, Gwen Verdon as Elvira, Celeste Holm as Ruth, and Kay Thompson as Madame Arcati, with Bob Fosse as director. Coward's dream cast failed to materialize, but he continued with the project.\n\nThe musical opened on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre on April 7, 1964, and closed on February 27, 1965, after 375 performances and 14 previews. Gower Champion aided Coward in directing the musical. The cast featured Edward Woodward as Charles, Tammy Grimes as Elvira, Louise Troy as Ruth, Beatrice Lillie as Madame Arcati, and Carol Arthur as Edith. Christopher Walken, billed as Ronnie Walken was in the chorus. Fred Werner was music director, scenic and costumes design were by Robert Fletcher, lighting design was by Jules Fisher, and Tammy Grimes' costume was by Valentina. The production was nominated for eight Tony Awards, but did not win any. Other major musical nominees that same year (1964) were \"Funny Girl\" and \"Hello, Dolly!\" and most major Tony wins went to the latter. \n\nAn original cast recording of the Broadway cast was released on the ABC Paramount label and the subsequent CD by MCA. \n\nCoward also directed the West End production, which opened in November 1964 at the Savoy Theatre, where it ran for 93 performances. The cast included Denis Quilley as Charles, Marti Stevens as Elvira, Jan Waters as Ruth, and Cicely Courtneidge as Madame Arcati. A London cast album was released by Pye Records, for whom Coward himself also recorded four numbers from the show: \"Something Tells Me\", \"If I Gave You\", \"Forever and a Day\", and \"Home Sweet Heaven\".In 1964, Courtneidge accepted the role of Madame Arcati in the London production of \"High Spirits\". This was an unhappy episode in her career. Coward himself co-directed, and the two clashed constantly in rehearsal. Courtneidge later said, \"Everyone \"does\" adore him – me included – but he's \"hell\" to work with, and I never want to do anything else with him. I'd have to be starving, I really would.\" After the opening night, Coward wrote in his diary, \"Cis also got some well-deserved cracks for vulgarizing Madame Arcati, and serve her bloody well right.\" The notices for the piece were dreadful, and those for Courtneidge's performance scarcely better: \"The Guardian\" wrote of \"a woeful excess of underplay\", and \"The Observer\" commented, \"The sight of Cicely Courtneidge hamming it until she drops in purple harem knickers with diamanté cycle clips isn't honestly hilarious enough to carry the evening.\"\n\n42nd Street Moon in San Francisco, California presented a staged concert version of the musical in March and April 2009.\n\nWriter Charles Condomine hosts a séance conducted by medium Madame Arcati in the hope that he will learn her tricks, so he can use the information in his new novel. His assumption that she is a fake is proven wrong when she falls into a trance and unwittingly conjures the spirit of his late wife Elvira, although he alone can see her. His present wife Ruth believes that Charles is joking until Elvira moves into the Condomine household and proves her presence by performing poltergeist-type pranks. Elvira's plan to kill Charles so he can join her in the beyond backfires when she accidentally disposes of Ruth, instead, and before long, the two female apparitions are disrupting their former husband's life with their constant nagging and bickering.\n\n"}

After being swept in the first round of the UHL playoffs, the Mechanics announced that they would suspend operations for the 2006-07 UHL season.\n\nAfter looking to relocate, the franchise was sold to a new owner who planned to keep the team in the Detroit area, with home games at the Michigan State Fairgrounds Coliseum, starting in 2008. Nothing new was heard before the league folded in 2010.\n\nThe team got a major boost during their first year when a lockout wiped out the 2004-05 NHL season, thus leaving the Mechanics the only professional hockey team in the Detroit market. The Mechanics signed three Detroit Red Wings players: Chris Chelios, Derian Hatcher, and Kris Draper. All three players had local ties; Hatcher had even played at the Mechanics' arena as a youth. However, due to visa problems, Kris Draper (a Canadian) never played a game for the Mechanics. Later, Motor City also signed Bryan Smolinski and Sean Avery, suiting up four active NHL players, more than any other North American pro team during the lockout. Despite the signings, however, the Mechanics barely played .500 hockey and missed the playoffs. \n\nFollowing a league investigation concerning the February 2, 2005 game played against the Flint Generals, UHL commissioner Richard Brosal suspended Mechanics' coach Steve Shannon for the rest of the season for offering his players $200 to \"take out\" Generals forward Kevin Kerr.\n"}
{"id": "1956498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956498", "title": "Air Force Test Center", "text": "Air Force Test Center\n\nThe Air Force Test Center (AFTC) is a development and test organization of the United States Air Force. It conducts research, development, test, and evaluation of aerospace systems from concept to deployment. It has test flown every aircraft in the Army Air Force's and the Air Force's inventory since World War II. The center employs nearly 13,000 people, and controls the second largest base in the Air Force.\n\nOn 6 July 2012, the previous Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) was redesignated as the Air Force Test Center (AFTC). Up until July 2012, the AFTC consisted of two subordinate wings. The 95th Air Base Wing (95 ABW) provided installation support for all units on Edwards Air Force Base while the 412th Test Wing (412 TW) conducted aircraft testing and evaluation at Edwards. In July 2012, the redesignated 96th Test Wing (96 TW), an amalgamation of the former 96th Air Base Wing, the former 46th Test Wing and the former Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and the Arnold Engineering Development Complex at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee, also came under control of the AFTC.\n\nThe Air Force Test Center (AFTC) conducts developmental and follow-on testing and evaluation of manned and unmanned aircraft and related avionics, flight-control, and weapon systems. AFTC also operates the USAF Test Pilot School, which trains test pilots, flight-test engineers, and flight-test navigators.\n\nThe Center has tested all the aircraft types in the Air Force inventory, and the center's work force—civilian, military and contractor—work together to flight test and evaluate new aircraft and upgrades to aircraft already in inventory for Air Force units, the Department of Defense, NASA and other government agencies. Upgrades to be tested here include improvements to radar, weapons-delivery and navigation systems, and a system to give tactical pilots the ability to strike ground targets from low altitudes at night and in adverse weather.\n\nThe Air Force Test Center develops, operates and maintains the Edwards Flight Test Range and Utah Test and Training Range. It also operates the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. The Center provides test infrastructure, overhead support for development, and operational test and evaluation support for aerospace research vehicles. AFFTC resources include the test and evaluation mission simulator, the Benefield Anechoic Chamber, Ridley Mission Control, and the Integration Facility for Avionics Systems Testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Air Force Flight Test Museum is open to military personnel with credentials to enter the base as well as general public tours offered periodically. The museum also features 40 aircraft on display at the museum or the nearby Blackbird Airpark in Palmdale, California. The museum also features aircraft engines, missiles, hardware, life support equipment, technical drawings, test reports memorabilia, and models.\n\nFlight testing began at Muroc Army Air Base (later renamed Edwards Air Force Base) during World War II. It dates to 17 February 1942 when the 477th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron (Reduced) was moved from Wright Field, Ohio to the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range. Its mission was to test the secret Bell Aircraft XP-59A jet fighter. Muroc was chosen as it was a secluded site in the Mojave Desert out of the public eye. The first XP-59A aircraft arrived on 21 September 1942 for ground tests and it was fitted with a dummy propeller attached to its nose, just in case the curious might see it and start asking why this aircraft didn't have a propeller.\n\nOn 30 September, Bell's test pilot Robert Stanley was undergoing some high-speed taxiing trials with the XP-59A when the aircraft \"inadvertently\" became airborne for a short time, reaching an altitude of ten feet for one-half-mile during high speed taxi tests. However, the first official flight was on 1 October with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, Royal Air Force, Army, Bell and General Electric personnel on hand.\n\nXP-59 aircraft testing continued at Muroc for the remainder of 1942 and in 1943. The second XP-59A flew on 15 February 1943 and the third late in April. Shortly before the first flight of the XP-59A, the USAAF had placed an order for one hundred P-59A Airacomets. However, the performance of the XP-59A service test aircraft had proved to be rather disappointing, not even up to the standards of conventional piston-engined fighter aircraft already in service with the USAAF. It was considered rather unlikely that any appreciable improvements in the performance of the P-59 would be soon be forthcoming, and by the early fall of 1943 the Airacomet was no longer considered by the USAAF as being worthy of consideration as an operational combat type.\n\nMost of the P-59s went to the Fourth Air Force 412th Fighter Group where they served in the training role. The Airacomets provided USAAF pilots and ground crews with valuable data about the difficulties and pitfalls involved in converting to jet aircraft. This information proved quite useful when more advanced jet fighters finally became available in quantity.\n\nIn the fall of 1944, Eighth Air Force tested its B-17 Flying Fortresses along with P-51D Mustangs against the XP-59 to see how well they stood up against the jet. The results were obvious. Also in October 1944, a small detachment arrived at Muroc for experimental work in rocket firing, remaining until the end of 1945.\n\nAlthough the XP-59A provided valuable experience to the USAAF in the operation of jet-powered aircraft, it was basically a flying testbed and not a combat-capable aircraft. The USAAF had to look elsewhere in its search for an effective jet fighter. The first flight of the Lockheed XP-80 took place on 8 January 1944 with test pilot Milo Burcham at the controls. The XP-80 was eventually transferred to the 412th Fighter Group for tactical evaluation.\n\nFollowing the war flight testing officially became the base's primary mission. Test work on the Lockheed P-80, the successor to the XP-59 was undertaken for the greater part of 1945. The Convair XP-81 and Republic XP-84 Thunderjet arrived at Muroc in 1946 for testing. It was clear by this time that the base's mission would be a proving ground for aircraft and a testing site for experimental aircraft.\n\nOn 14 October 1947, Captain Charles E. Yeager, piloted the Bell X-1 to a speed of 760 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier for the first time. In the years since, multiple generations of experimental \"X-Planes\" have been tested and flown at Edwards, for the Air Force and other agencies, such as NASA. Simultaneously, the base was hosting testing for proposed weapon systems including the F-84 Thunderjet, F-86 Sabre, F-94 Starfire, and B-45 Tornado.\n\nThe first Northrop XB-35 Flying Wing (serial number 42-13603) took off on its maiden flight on 25 June 1946, with Max Stanley as pilot and Dale Schroeder as flight engineer. On this first flight, the aircraft was flown from Hawthorne to Muroc, a flight lasting 45 minutes. The propeller-driven XB-35 however, was considered outdated and it was replaced by the jet-powered YB-49 on 21 October 1947 from the Northrop Field at Hawthorne, California, piloted by Northrop's chief test pilot, Max Stanley. At the end of the flight, it landed at Muroc Air Force Base where it was to carry out its test program. On the morning of 5 June 1948, XB-49 42-102368 crashed just north of Muroc Dry Lake. The pilot, Air Force Capt. Glenn Edwards, and all four other members of the crew were killed. In 1951 Muroc AFB was re-designated Edwards Air Force Base in his honor.\n\nWith the transfer of Edwards AFB from Air Materiel Command to the newly created Air Research and Development Command, the postwar 2759th Experimental Wing was inactivated, being replaced by the Air Force Flight Test Center on 25 June 1951.\n\nTechnology pioneered through the AFTC led to remarkable advancements in aviation. The \"Century Series\" of aircraft, the F-100 Super Sabre; F-102 Delta Dagger, the Mach 2 F-104 Starfighter; F-105 Thunderchief and the F-106 Delta Dart made supersonic flight commonplace in combat aircraft. The Century Series fighters defined the basic speed and altitude envelopes for fighters that are still in effect today. Meanwhile, the aircraft of the X series continued to set speed and altitude records.\n\nThe 1960s ushered in the Space Age. The Test Pilot School was re-designated as the Aerospace Research Pilot School as it began to train future astronauts. The North American X-15 arrived and began to explore hypersonic and exoatmospheric flight. Major Robert \"Bob\" White became the first person to fly an aircraft into space on 17 July 1962 when he flew his X-15 to an altitude of 314,750 feet. Flying the same airframe a year later Joe Walker reached an altitude of 354,200 feet (67 miles). On 3 October 1967 William \"Pete\" Knight set the standing aircraft speed record of Mach 6.72 (4,520 mph), again flying an X-15. When the space program began a number of astronauts were selected from the Air Force's test pilot cadre. Additionally, the AFTC assisted with the testing of rocket engines and re-entry vehicles.\n\nAlong with the X-15, pilots at Edwards were expanding the frontiers of atmospheric flight, testing the XB-70 Valkyrie high-altitude bomber, along with the YF-12 interceptor for Air Defense Command and the SR-71 Blackbird Strategic Reconnaissance aircraft for Strategic Air Command.\n\nWith the decline of the military manned space mission after the NASA Lunar Landing Program ended, the Aerospace Research Pilot School was once again re-designated as the USAF Test Pilot School. The school replaced its space-oriented curriculum with an entire new battery of courses focusing on systems and test management. New aircraft arrived in the 1970s with the McDonnell F-15 Eagle. Two major \"fly-offs\" were conducted, one between the Northrop YA-9 and the Fairchild Republic YA-10, the other between the Northrop YF-17 and General Dynamics YF-16. The Rockwell B-1 Lancer began flight testing in 1974 with its multitude of highly sophisticated offensive and defensive systems.\n\nIn April 1981, the wheels of Space Shuttle Columbia touched down on Rogers Dry Lakebed, with Astronauts John Young and Robert Crippin successfully landing the first orbiting space vehicle ever to leave the Earth under rocket power and return to Earth aerodynamically for re-use. The \"Flying Wing\" returned to Edwards in the late 1980s when the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber began testing, and at a remote site, the F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter. Air-Launched Cruise Missile, and LANTIRN systems were also tested during the 1980s.\n\nThe 1990s saw the arrival of the Lockheed YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23 prototype fighters, both using stealth technology and designed for air supremacy with agility, high-speed and supersonic cruise capability. Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was tested that has subsequently been used extensively for high-level reconnaissance in the skies of Afghanistan and Iraq began testing in February 1998. The MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper attack counterparts, tested at Edwards, today fill a critical role in the Global War on Terrorism.\n\nMore recently the AFTC has been part of the anti-satellite missile and Joint Direct Attack Munition development. Additionally, the center has played a key role in the development of the Air Force's X-35A and X-32A prototypes for the Joint Strike Fighter program, both making their first flights in late 2000. The resulting F-35 Lightning II is being built in three versions for the Air Force, the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as multiple allied military partners. NASA maintains its Armstrong Flight Research Center on Edwards and partners with the AFFTC on aircraft development.\n\nEffective 6 July 2012, it was re-designated from the Air Force Flight Test Center to the Air Force Test Center, part of a new five-center construct across Air Force Materiel Command. The new name reflects AFTC's expanded mission which includes Eglin AFB and Arnold AFB as well as flight test activities at Edwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Local fans complained about high ticket prices and a lower level of play than the ECHL. The midwestern focus of the UHL also made rivalries less intense than they had been with the southeastern and mid-atlantic teams of the ECHL.

They played out of the Montreal Forum in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n\nThe Junior Canadiens were a farm team to the NHL Montreal Canadiens from the early 1930s until the institution of the NHL Entry Draft. The Juniors originally played in the Quebec Junior Hockey League.\n\nIn 1961 the franchise switched to the Ontario Hockey Association to compete at the major junior level. It was granted entry as an expansion club in 1961. At the time, major hockey in Quebec, and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, did not exist.\n\nIn the Quebec Junior playoffs, the Junior Canadiens defeated the Quebec Citadels and the Halifax St. Marys. The series versus Halifax was surrendered by St. Marys when Montreal won the first two games on the road by scores of 11–3 and 10–1. After that the Junior Canadiens defeated the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters to represent eastern Canada in the Memorial Cup.\n\nThe Memorial Cup of 1950 saw two farm teams of the Montreal Canadiens playing each other for the top junior prize. The Junior Canadiens defeated the Regina Pats in a best-of-seven game series by 4 games to 1, winning on home ice at the Forum.\n\nIn 1955, the Quebec Junior Hockey League disbanded. With the Canadiens as the sole-survivor of the league, they elected to play an independent schedule but still compete in the Laurier Cup seasonal tournament with the teams of the OHA. The Canadiens would win the Laurier Cup that year, outplaying the best of the OHA. The Canadiens entered the Richardson Trophy playdowns as an independent team, but lost in the finals to the OHA's Toronto Marlboros 4-games-to-3 with 1 tie.\n\nIn 1956, their parent team moved them to the Capital Region under the name Ottawa-Hull Canadiens. The Jr. Habs would play a series of games against the OHA, the Quebec Hockey League, and the OHA Senior A League to prepare for the playoffs. The Canadiens finished second in the Laurier Cup to the Toronto Marlboros. The Canadiens would have a great season, win the George Richardson Memorial Trophy as Eastern Canadian Junior A champions, but lose the 1957 Memorial Cup in seven games to the Flin Flon Bombers.\n\nIn 1957, the Canadiens would win the Laurier Cup for the second time of its four-year existence and again win the Richardson Trophy again. This time around, the Canadiens would win the 1958 Memorial Cup by defeating the Regina Pats in five games.\n\nIn 1958, the Canadiens dropped their series with the OHA as the Laurier Cup was abolished. They joined the OHA Senior A League as a full member instead. With a mixed Senior/Junior roster, the Canadiens would finish third in the OHA Senior League's Eastern League and lose the Eastern League's semi-final to the Kingston Merchants 4-games-to-3 with 1 tie. The junior portion of the squad moved on to the Richardson Trophy playdowns, where it lost the final to Peterborough Petes.\n\nIn 1959, the Eastern Professional Hockey League formed the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens in the region, another Montreal NHL affiliate. To avoid conflict with the new club, the Jr. Habs were moved to become the Brockville Canadiens and joined the Metropolitan Montreal Junior Hockey League. Their players still maintained affiliation with the Pro Canadiens and often played for both teams. The Canadiens dominated their new league with a 25-1-0 record and participated in the Quebec Junior championships instead of the league's playoffs. The Canadiens would be named 1960 Quebec Junior Champions by crushing the Alma Aiglons 11-1 and 10-0 before the Aiglons conceded the third game. The Canadiens would make it all the way to the Richardson Trophy final before finally losing out. In the final, they faced the OHA's St. Catharines Teepees. The Teepees would win the first three games of the series, but the Canadiens would battle back to tie the series at 3-games-to-3 with 1 tie. The Teepees would win the decisive Game 8 6-3 to clinch the series.\n\nIn 1960, the franchise relocated to become the Hull Canadiens. Despite having junior players on their roster, the team joined the more competitive Interprovincial Senior Hockey League. They would be 1960-61 regular season (losing only twice) and 1961 playoff champions of the ISHL with a sweep of the Smiths Falls Rideaus and defeating Ottawa St. Anthonys 3-games-to-1. The Canadiens represented the Ottawa District in 1961 Allan Cup playdowns but were swept by the Quebec champion Granby Victorias.\n\nA prominent player in this independent era was Jacques Laperrière. After playing his first junior year with the St-Laurent Jets of the MMJHL in 1957-58, the next season he signed with the Ottawa-Hull Canadiens in the Eastern League of the OHA Senior Loop and played as both a junior and senior member of the split squad. In 1959-60, he continued with the Brockville Canadiens as they found a home in the MMJHL, but split his time called up with the EPHL Canadiens. The next season as a junior player on the Hull Canadiens in Interprovincial Senior he was again up as a call-up in the EPHL with the Semi-Pro Canadiens. In 1961-62, he moved with the Jr. Canadiens back to Montreal as they joined the OHA but still came up for a single EPHL game. In 1962-63, he turned full pro and signed directly with the EPHL Canadiens. By the end of the season he was in the NHL with the Habs and stayed there until he retired in 1974.\n\nIn the Summer of 1961, the parent club was successful on getting the club into the OHA and brought them back to Montreal permanently.\n\nIn the 1957 season with the minor pro Quebec Hockey League, Ottawa put together a record of 7 wins, 12 losses, and a tie, with 57 goals for and 74 goals against. The Canadiens, on average, were about 5–8 years younger than their opponents and held up well.\n\nOttawa won the right to play for the Cup by defeating the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters to win the George Richardson Memorial Trophy as Eastern Canadian representatives.\n\nThe Junior Canadiens were runners-up to the Memorial Cup in 1957. They were defeated by the Flin Flon Bombers 4 games to 3 in a best-of-seven series.\nIn 1958 the team was known from that year on as the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens, not to be confused with the senior team of a similar name. The Junior Canadiens defeated the Toronto Marlboros to win their second consecutive Richardson Trophy.\n\nHull-Ottawa's opponent for the Memorial Cup would be another farm team of NHL Montreal team, the Regina Pats.\nIn the summer of 1961, the Ontario Hockey Association Junior-A League was reduced to five teams, when several teams split away to form the Metro Junior A League. In August, Ontario Hockey Association president Lloyd Pollock applied to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) to permit the Canadiens to switch from the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association to play in the OHA as its sixth team. The request was denied by CAHA president Jack Roxburgh, who stated that CAHA rules do not allow en masse transfers between provincial associations. The proposal for the Canadiens to play in the OHA's junior division was later approved in September 1961, when the CAHA branch presidents voted in its favour.\n\nThis team is considered by many to be the greatest junior hockey team of all time. The Junior Canadiens beat out the St. Catharines Black Hawks for the OHA Championship, then bettered the Sorel Black Hawks (Éperviers) 3 games to 1 for the Richardson Cup. The Montreal roster that year featured 13 rookies. The Canadiens would pick up netminder Jim Rutherford from the Hamilton Red Wings for the national championship.\n\nThe Memorial Cup of 1969 would be a rematch of 19 years earlier, with the Regina Pats. The first two games were scheduled for the Montreal Forum, with the remainder of the games to be played in Regina's Exhibition Stadium. The Junior Canadiens swept the Regina Pats in a very physical series.\nThe 1970 Junior Canadiens finished 1st in the OHA then defeated the Ottawa 67's and St. Catharines Black Hawks to reach the finals versus the Toronto Marlboros. The Junior Canadiens triumphed for the J. Ross Robertson Cup then played the NOHA champion Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds.\n\nMontreal won the first game 6–2, but the \"Soo\" won game two 5–4. It was the first time in history that a team from the NOHA beat an OHA team in the playoffs. Montreal quickly responded winning the next three games 10–1, 9–2 and 20–1.\n\nFor the Richardson Cup the Canadiens would play the Quebec Junior Hockey League champions Quebec Remparts. The Remparts featured Guy Lafleur. The Canadiens prevailed in a 3-game sweep in front of crowds numbering over 14,000 in Quebec City, and over 18,000 in Montreal.\n\nTheir opponents for the Memorial Cup of 1970 would be the Weyburn Red Wings of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. Coached by Stan Dunn the Red Wings were a very tough forechecking squad. The games became closer as the series progressed, but the Junior Canadiens swept the series, winning on home ice at the Forum.\nIn 1972 the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League had been in operation for three years, giving the province major junior competition for the first time. The Q obviously wanted a team in the province's largest city, and was threatening a lawsuit to force the Junior Canadiens back into the Quebec-based league. Over the summer of 1972 the OHA granted the Junior Habs a \"one-year suspension\" of operations, while team ownership transferred the team and players into the QMJHL, renaming themselves the Montreal Bleu Blanc Rouge in the process. The OHA then reactivated the suspended franchise for the 1973–74 season in Kingston, Ontario, under new ownership and with new players, calling the team the Kingston Canadians. The new Kingston team had little connection with the old Junior Canadiens, but in some OHA histories (such as the annual Media Guide) the Kingston team is still shown as the legitimate successors of the Junior Canadiens' legacy.\n\nMemorial Cup<br>\"National championship.\"\n\nGeorge Richardson Memorial Trophy<br>\"Eastern Canadian championship.\"\n\nJ. Ross Robertson Cup<br>\"Ontario Hockey Association championship.\"\n\nHamilton Spectator Trophy<br>\"First overall in the OHA regular season standings.\"\nSam Pollock and Billy Reay coached the 1950 Memorial Cup champions Jr. Canadiens. Elmer Lach coached the 1954–55 squad. Claude Ruel coached the team its first two years in the OHA, he would later win the Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens in 1969. Former goaltender Yves Nadon piloted the team to its first OHA finals in 1964. Roger Bedard led the team to successive Memorial Cup wins in 1969 & 1970.\n\nRed Tilson Trophy<br>OHL Most valuable player.\n\nEddie Powers Memorial Trophy<br>OHL Top Point Scorer.\nMax Kaminsky Trophy<br>Most Outstanding Defenceman.\n\nDave Pinkney Trophy<br>Lowest team goals against average.\n\nWilliam Hanley Trophy<br>Most sportsmanlike player.\n\n\nThe Junior Canadiens played at the Montreal Forum, on the same ice as the NHL team. The Montreal Forum also hosted Memorial Cup games in 1950, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1973 & 1976, with the Junior Canadiens winning on home ice in 1950 & 1970.\n"}

The park, which features scenic overlooks of the nearby Catskill Mountains, is primarily used for picnicking, hiking, mountain biking, snowshoeing and swimming. The park is managed by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.\n\nFour of the five sky lakes on the Shawangunk Ridge lie within the preserve: Lake Minnewaska, Lake Awosting, Mud Pond (also known as Lake Haseco), and Lake Maratanza; Mohonk Lake, is on the property of the Mohonk Mountain House to the north of Minnewaska. Lake Minnewaska is a bit less than long by wide at its widest point. Lake Awosting is roughly three times as large, with a length of about and a maximum width of about mile.\n\nOriginally part of Albert and Alfred Smiley's Mohonk Mountain House property, the Minnewaska Mountain House, or Cliff House, was built in 1879 overlooking Lake Minnewaska; it could accommodate 225 guests. After managing and developing Mohonk's early growth for ten years, twin Alfred H. Smiley purchased and developed Minnewaska separate from Mohonk, but the brothers exchanged courtesies to each other's guests. A second hotel, Wildmere, accommodated 350 guests. In 1955, Kenneth B. Phillips, Sr., the Minnewaska general manager, bought the property from the Smiley family. Cliff House was abandoned in 1972 due to maintenance costs; it burned to the ground in 1978. Wildmere closed in 1979 and burned to the ground in 1986.\n\nAfter years of wrangling over commercial development proposals and lawsuits to block development, New York State bought the property in 1987 and opened the Minnewaska State Park Preserve in 1993. A significant expansion of occurred in 1996 when the Open Space Institute transferred acreage to the park preserve from the old Ellenville watershed lands, now called Sam's Point Preserve. The preserve was managed by the Nature Conservancy and by the Open Space Institute until April 2015, at which time management was transferred to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.\n\nLocated within the Minnewaska State Park Preserve and neighboring Mohonk Preserve is the Trapps Mountain Hamlet Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\n\nIn March 2006, an additional were added to the preserve as a result of action by a coalition of conservation groups including the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference, Open Space Institute, and Nature Conservancy. The success was made possible in part because the real estate partnership that sought to develop the Awosting Reserve property collapsed due to an internal financial dispute. To settle this dispute among the partners, a court ordered that the property be sold. The Trust for Public Land purchased the property for $17 million and immediately turned the land over to New York State.\n\nUnique communities such as ice cave talus, pitch pine-oak-heath rocky summit, and extensive chestnut oak forest comprise Minnewaska State Park Preserve. These ecosystems host a variety of plants and animals that are uncommon in New York State. Wildlife such as the timber rattlesnake (\"Crotalus horridus\"), bobcat (\"Lynx rufus\") and New York State's only documented occurrence of the noctuid moth \"Zale curema\" reside within the preserve.\n\nSwimming was allowed throughout the entirety of Lake Minnewaska and surrounding Lake Awosting and Peterskill areas until 1987 when New York State purchased the land and closed the lake to public recreation. In 1988 under the guidance of Helga Schwartz and through numerous petitions, swimming was reinstated in a small roped off area.\n\nOn April 19, 2000 Judy Mage, Myriam Miedzian, and Ellen James met with Park officials and the PIPC (Palisades Interstate Park Commission) to present proposals for the allowance of distance swimming on the lake. As a result of this meeting the designated swim area in the lake was increased and the closing time for swimming was extended by half an hour.\n\nOn June 11, 2000 SWIM (Swim Without Interference at Minnewaska) was created to attempt to bring back swimming throughout the entire lake. After much debate and negotiations with Parks officials, SWIM proposed the formation of a club where members would be tested for swimming ability, purchase insurance cards, and sign release of liability forms. The group was able to secure a second swimming area consisting of a 200-yard buoyed cable that runs parallel to the shoreline for distance swimming.\n\nIn the Spring of 2002 SWIM became the Minnewaska Distance Swimmer's Association (MDSA) and signed up 430 members its first year. Currently the MDSA has close to 700 members. \n\n\n"}

Jean Bégin was named head coach for the final five games of the season and the playoffs. The team that season included future NHL players Claude Lemieux, Jimmy Carson, Gerry Fleming, Shane MacEachern, and Everett Sanipass.\n\nBégin led Verdun to three wins in the remainder of the regular season, and a first-place finish in the Lebel Division. In the playoffs, Verdun defeated the Hull Olympiques four games to one in the first round, then defeated the Shawinigan Cataractes four games to one in the second round, and defeated the Chicoutimi Saguenéens in four consecutive games to win the President's Cup.

{"id": "1956534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956534", "title": "MGM-5 Corporal", "text": "MGM-5 Corporal\n\nThe MGM-5 Corporal missile was a nuclear-armed tactical surface-to-surface missile. It was the first guided weapon authorized by the United States to carry a nuclear warhead. A guided tactical ballistic missile, the Corporal could deliver either a nuclear fission, high-explosive, fragmentation or chemical warhead up to a range of .\n\nIt was developed by the United States Army in partnership with Caltech's pioneering Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and initially produced by Douglas Aircraft Company. As development continued production shifted to Firestone Tire and Rubber Company (airframe) and Gilfillan Brothers Inc. (guidance). The Corporal was designed as a tactical nuclear missile for use in the event of Cold War hostilities in Western Europe. The first U.S. Army Corporal battalion was deployed in Europe in 1955. Eight Corporal battalions were deployed in Europe and remained in the field until 1964, when the system was replaced by the solid-fueled MGM-29 Sergeant missile system. The Corporal was the third in a series of JPL rockets for the US Army whose names correspond to the progression in Army enlisted ranks, starting with Private before ultimately leading to the MGM-29 Sergeant.\n\nThe U.S. Army Ordnance California Institute Technology (ORDCIT) program that eventually produced the Corporal ballistic missile began in June 1944 with a contract to the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratories California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) to develop a ballistic guided missile. As the technology to build such a weapon did not exist in the United States it had to be created. GALCIT, later transformed into the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), began incremental efforts starting with a solid-fuel rocket program called Private. It progressed to a liquid-fuel unguided rocket called WAC Corporal, with a research missile variant (Corporal E) also under development. In late 1949 the Army desired to accelerate the Corporal program to create a military weapon by turning the Corporal E into a crash program. The resultant Corporal ballistic missile was developed by JPL and first flew in its weapon version at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico on August 7, 1952.. The Corporal crash program involved utilizing as much existing equipment as it could including the WW II SCR-584 radar. \n\nCorporal used a liquid-fueled rocket burning red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) and aniline; the exact mixture of fuel and oxidizer changed over the Corporal service period. From round 11 of the test program it became RFNA as oxidizer and a fuel consisting of 80% aniline with 20% furfuryl alcohol. As the Corporal was a crash program and constantly under development after 1958 to reduce decomposition of the RFNA and improve performance, the propellants were changed to IRFNA (inhibited red fuming nitric acid), 14% NO, 2.5% H0, 0.6% HF and 82.9% HNO oxidizer, with 46.5% aniline, 46.5% furfuryl alcohol and 7% hydrazine as fuel. this required elaborate and time-consuming preparation immediately before launch, making its tactical responsiveness questionable.\n\nGuidance for the Corporal consisted of a complex system of internal and ground guidance. During the initial launch phase, inertial guidance kept the missile in a vertical position and pre-set guidance steered it during its launch. The ground guidance system was a modified World War II SCR-584 radar which tracked the missile's position, as well as its slant range. This information was sent to an analog computer which calculated the trajectory and any necessary correction to hit the target. A Doppler radar was used to accurately measure the missile's velocity, and this information was also used in the trajectory calculation. The Doppler radar was also used to send the final range correction and warhead arming command after the missile re-entered the atmosphere. Transponder beacons were used in the missile to provide a return signal for tracking at maximum range. The vulnerability of the Corporal system was of concern from the beginning of the weapon program. Electronic anticountermeasures were addressed over the length of the program and would have been greatly improved in Corporal III. Though a variety of warheads from high explosive and fragmentation to chemical had been developed the warhead which the missile was equipped was the W-7 (Mk.7).\n\nA Corporal battalion was composed of 250 men requiring 35 vehicles to deploy and took nine hours to set up the missile to fire once the launch position had been reached. Corporal missile battalions in Europe were highly mobile, considering the large number of support vehicles and personnel required to support the transportation, checkout, and launch of this liquid-fueled nuclear-tipped (or conventional HE or chemical) missile. In Germany, frequent unannounced 'Alerts' were performed—necessitating assembling all personnel and moving vehicles and missiles to a pre-assigned assembly point. From there the battalion would move to a launch site—usually somewhere in a remote forest—set up the missile on its launcher and go through a detailed checkout of the various systems. This was not a trivial operation as these electronic systems were largely vacuum tubes. A mock firing would be performed and the entire battalion would be gone as soon as possible in order to not be a target of counter-battery fire. The deployment in the field during an Alert was amazingly swift due to the highly trained crews.\n\nFor what was the first nuclear armed missile the Corporal I was significantly unreliable and inaccurate. The continuing development of the Corporal weapon system led rapidly to the development of the Corporal II. This was initiated while the Corporal I was still under development. Though Corporal I was deemed operable many shortcomings in both the missile and ground equipment tactical usability had become obvious during development. Engineer-User trials had shown that the primary reason for mechanical and electrical causes arose because the systems of the Corporal I were too delicate. Problems detected in the E-U trials were addressed in the Corporal II. The Type II Corporal was subsequently improved in the Corporal IIa and IIb (M2A1) versions. The first Corporal II prototype was flown on October 8, 1953. The first complete Type II system was delivered in February 1955, The Type II Corporal greatly improved the accuracy and reliability of the missile system. When compared to other early missiles the final production Corporal II was reasonably accurate. Still the aggregate accuracy of all Type IIs with a CPE (Circular Probable Error) of 350 meters which was still short of the desired 300 meters. The role of JPL was greatly reduced in 1955–56.\n\nThe deficiencies of the Corporal II led to the design and development of Corporal III. The objectives of Corporal III were to produce a much improved weapon system with improved reliability, ground support equipment, and especially ground guidance equipment, to provide the Army with a fully developed weapon. Only small changes to the Corporal IIb missile would be required. In 1956 all research and development work on the Corporal II had been completed. A study at Redstone Arsenal noted that the MGM-29 Sergeant missile system would become available for service in 1963 and that Corporal III equipment should only be procured for additional Corporal units. Though a Type III Corporal was flown in 1957 it was too late for the eternally developing Corporal system. On May 23, 1957 all work on the Corporal III was ended to conserve fund for Sergeant following defense budget cuts. In 1963 the solid-fueled Sergeant missiles with self contained inertial guidance systems which was jamming proof, and which took only an hour from occupying the site to launch of the missile, started replacing the Corporal IIb in Europe. By June 1964 the Corporal system was history in American service. In June 1966 the last Corporal unit, the 27th Guided Weapons Regiment Royal Artillery, retired its Corporals.\n\nThe first three Corporal battalions were activated in March 1952 with an Engineer-User launch program beginning in January 1953. In the same year the Corporal II system was sold to the United Kingdom. The extremely ambitious original goal of the Corporal program was to have 16 battalions of missiles deployed by July 1954. Two batteries of Corporal I had been organized and equipped by July 1954. The 259th Corporal Battalion deployed to Europe in February 1955. It was followed by other units and by 1960 there were six battalions in Germany, two in Italy and four in the United States. Live-fire training for Germany-based US forces took place at Fort Bliss but later the British Royal Artillery Guided Weapons Range on the Scottish island of Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides was used. Missiles were fired toward designated target coordinates in the Atlantic Ocean. Radar on Hirta (the main island of the St Kilda archipelago of Scotland) identified missile landing points. Frequently, Soviet spy ship 'fishing trawlers' would intrude into the target area. The UK adoption of the Corporal resulted in the islet of Rockall being incorporated into the United Kingdom in 1955, the last addition to the UK, to prevent its use by Soviet observers: the UK Minister of Defence Harold Macmillan was concerned that were they do to so, the Soviets might discover how to jam Corporal guidance and tracking radio signals.\n\n\nA version of the Corporal was made as a die-cast toy by manufacturers such as Corgi and Dinky. The Corgi Corporal, marketed to children as 'the rocket you can launch', was timed to coincide with the British test firing in 1959.\n\nA 1/40 scale plastic model kit of the Corporal missile with its mobile transporter was produced in the late 1950s and was reissued by Revell-Monogram in 2009.\n\nA 1/48 scale plastic model kit of the Corporal missile with its launcher was produced in 1959 by Hawk and was reissued in 1969 in a glow in the dark version.\n\n\n"}

(It is this battle which is commemorated in the Marine Hymn's words, \"From the Halls of Montezuma ...\")\n\nHe was brevetted first lieutenant September 13, 1847, for gallantry in those actions. After the war he commanded the guard of the frigates and in the Mediterranean from 1849 to 1852. He then served at the Philadelphia Navy Yard until 1854. He received promotion to first lieutenant on January 2, 1855 and, after various services afloat and ashore, became captain on July 26, 1861.\n\nIn the Civil War, he aided in the capture of Port Royal, South Carolina, November 7, 1861 and led a detachment of 200 Marines to reoccupy the Norfolk Navy Yard, May 1862. He subsequently commanded Marine detachments during operations in Charleston Harbor against Forts Wagner, Gregg, and Sumter. For gallant and meritorious conduct during the boat attack on Fort Sumter, September 8, 1863, he was brevetted to the rank of major and received a full promotion to that rank on June 10, 1864.\n\nAfter the war, he became a First Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on December 5, 1867.\n\nOn November 1, 1876, he was appointed colonel commandant, the highest post in the Marine Corps, and served in that position until he retired on January 29, 1891.

Olson's first successful move as owner operator was to bring in local football star Kevin Porter to coach the upstart team. Porter, an alumnus of Auburn University, and the Kansas City Chiefs was also an arena football veteran. Under his leadership, the inaugural team made the playoffs and was named \"Expansion Franchise of the Year\" by the league.

{"id": "1956546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956546", "title": "Fan film", "text": "Fan film\n\nA fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, television program, comic book, book, or video game created by fans rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs, but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in quality, as well as in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to full-length motion pictures. Fan films are also examples of fan labor and the remix culture. Closely related concepts are Fandubs, Fansubs and Vidding which are reworks of fans on already released film material.\n\nThe earliest known fan film is \"Anderson 'Our Gang\", which was produced in 1926 by a pair of itinerant filmmakers. Shot in Anderson, South Carolina, the short is based on the \"Our Gang\" film series; the only known copy resides in the University of South Carolina's Newsfilm Library. Various amateur filmmakers created their own fan films throughout the ensuing decades, including a teenaged Hugh Hefner, but the technology required to make fan films was a limiting factor until relatively recently. In the 1960s UCLA film student Don Glut filmed a series of short black and white \"underground films\", based on adventure and comic book characters from 1940s and 1950s motion picture serials. Around the same time, artist Andy Warhol produced a film called \"Batman Dracula\" which could be described as a fan film. But it wasn't until the 1970s that the popularization of science fiction conventions allowed fans to show their films to the wider fan community.\n\nIn the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, there were many unofficial foreign remakes of American films that today may be considered fan films, such as \"Süpermenler\" (Superman), \"3 Dev Adam\", (Spider-Man), \"Mahakaal\" (\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"), and \"Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam\" (\"Star Wars\").\n\nMost of the more prominent science fiction films and television shows are represented in fan films; these include \"Star Wars\" (see ), \"Star Trek\" (see Star Trek fan productions), \"Doctor Who\" (see Doctor Who spin-offs), and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (see Unofficial Buffy the Vampire Slayer productions). Because fan films generally utilize characters and storylines copyrighted and trademarked by the original filmmakers, they are rarely distributed commercially for legal reasons. They are exhibited by various other methods, including showings at comic book and science fiction conventions, and distribution as homemade videos, ranging from VHS videocassettes to CD-ROMs and DVDs.\n\nNotable fan film is also \"\", made as a shot-for-shot remake of the 1981 Indiana Jones adventure film \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Using the original film's screenplay and score, it principally starred and was filmed, directed, and produced over a seven-year period by three Mississippi teenagers (Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb). In 2015, the documentary \"\" was released. The film follows three childhood friends, Eric Zala, Chris Strompolos, and Jayson Lamb, from 1982 to 1989 as they set out to make their fan film of \"Raiders\" fan film.\n\nFilmmaker Sandy Collora gained much notoriety in the early 2000s for a series of fan films he produced featuring DC Comics heroes Batman and Superman. \"\" premiered at the 2003 San Diego Comic-Con, while \"World's Finest\" was prevented from showing in 2004 due to copyright claims from Warner Bros.\n\nSome fan film productions achieve significant quantity and or quality. For instance, the series \"\" produced 50 episodes over seven seasons - compared to only 34 episodes for the 1970s sci-fi series \"Battlestar Galactica\" and \"Galactica 1980\" combined.\n\n\"\" started as a fan production, but has since attracted support from several crew and cast members from the different \"Star Trek\" series, as well as a wide audience.\n\nOn October 31, 2016, Greek film director, film producer and writer Christos Arfanis, released \"\". A fan film based on Saw. The film is one of the Most Popular Fan Film Movies and TV Shows, according to IMDb. The film has received mixed ratings.\n\n\"\", a Finnish feature-length spoof of both \"Star Trek\" and \"Babylon 5\", attracted over 4 million downloads and has been released on DVD in several countries, making it possibly the most successful Finnish movie-production to date.\n\nThe \"Lord of the Rings\" fan films \"Born of Hope\" and \"The Hunt for Gollum\" debuted at Ring*Con and the Sci-Fi-London film festival (respectively) in May 2009 and was released on the internet.\n\n\"The Legend of Zelda\" with its loyal base had a fan film called \"\" which received a strong following of fans. The movie premiered in Atlanta, GA in 2009 and online in December 2009 only to be shut down by Nintendo on January 1, 2010.\n\n\"\" features a small nod to the fan film \"Return of the Ghostbusters\" by way of a drawing posted on the wall in the Ghostbusters firehouse headquarters. The child's drawing of a Ghostbuster is signed by a fictional character created in the fan film.\n\nOn September 27, 2009, Italian fan film \"\" was released over the internet, a 10,000 Euro production based on Hideo Kojima's \"Metal Gear Solid\" video game series.\n\nDan Poole's stunt work in his fan film \"The Green Goblin's Last Stand\" garnered recognition and an endorsement from Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee.\n\nJohn F. Carroll's \"Masters of the Universe\" trilogy began with \"The Wizard of Stone Mountain\" in 2011 and has premiered at conventions in Germany and the US. Other films in the trilogy will be released on the internet in 2013.\n\nDue to copyright protection, trademark protection and limited fair use provisions, fan films made without official authorization might exist in a legal grey area.\n\nStill, fan films often operate under the radar or IP owners turning a blind eye as long they are non-commercial activities.\n\nThe popularity of fan productions brought about by affordable consumer equipment and animation programs (Prosumer equipment) with the digital revolution, along with the ease of distribution created by the Internet and Web 2.0, has prompted several studios to adapt their official policies and programs regarding fan films.\n\nThe highest profile of these programs has been Lucasfilm's Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, launched in 2000. The awards formerly permitted only documentary, mockumentary, and parody entries, while prohibiting serious fan fiction. However, this restriction was lifted for the 2007 awards. Lucasfilm's limited support and sanction of fan creations is a marked contrast to the attitudes of many other copyright holders.\n\nSome copyright holders opened up for the idea of fan films: DC Comics was known to actively discourage the creation of fan movies in the 1990s. In 2008, however, DC Comics changed its tune when its president, Paul Levitz, gave provisional permission to fan filmmakers, stating definitively, \"We’re against anything that monetizes our assets and our copyrights without our permission. We are not against things where people use our assets if they don’t do anything monetarily with them.\" Similarly, Paramount took a more welcoming stance towards fan filmmakers in the 2000s.\n\nUnlike many American TV shows, the British series \"Doctor Who\" allowed its writers to retain the rights to characters and plot elements that they created - most famously with Terry Nation's Daleks. While the BBC has never licensed the character of the Doctor for use in fan films, a number of the writers have consented to allow the monsters and supporting characters they created to be used in direct-to-video productions (see Doctor Who spin-offs).\n\nThe creators of \"Red Dwarf\" sponsored a fan film contest of their own in 2005, inspired by an earlier fan film production in 2001 called \"Red Dwarf - The Other Movie\", with a fairly wide remit ranging from fictional stories set in the \"Red Dwarf\" universe to documentaries about the show and its fandom. The two winning shorts were featured in their entirety as bonus features on the Series VIII DVD release, along with a montage of clips from the runner-up entries and a short intro clip from \"Red Dwarf - The Other Movie\". This made them among the first fan films to be commercially released by a property's original creators.\n\nFox Studios is known to shut down fan productions, in 2008 they sent a cease and desist letter to close production on a Max Payne short that was in production. MGM has been known to force internet-distributed James Bond fan films offline, too.\n\nParamount Pictures actively pursued legal action against \"Star Trek\" fan films in the 1980s, such as the animated film series \"Star Trix\", and a never completed fan episode spinoff tentatively titled \"Yorktown: A Time to Heal\" starring George Takei and James Shigeta.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015, animator Matthew Gafford developed \"Star Fox: The Animated Series\", a webseries based on Nintendo's \"Star Fox\" video game franchise. However, after a cease-and-desist from Nintendo based on the usage of the \"Star Fox\" intellectual property, Gafford changed the name of the webseries to \"A Fox In Space\". The first episode of \"A Fox In Space\" was released online in April 2016.\n\nIn June 2014, \"Godzilla: Heritage\", a fan film based on the \"Godzilla\" franchise, was announced on Kickstarter. The project, conceived by filmmakers Timothy Schiefer and Greg Graves, was unsuccessful in meeting its initial crowdfunding goal of $25,000, receiving only $16,025 from 186 backers. On July 18, 2014, a second Kickstarter campaign for the film was created, this time reaching a set goal of $10,000, receiving $19,554 from 193 backers. Following the release of a teaser trailer for the film in 2016, the filmmakers were contacted by Toho, the company which owns the rights to the \"Godzilla\" franchise. In order to protect Toho's intellectual property and to avoid confusion in the marketplace, the filmmakers agreed to a number of conditions, including that the film would not have the word \"Godzilla\" in the title, that the filmmakers would not receive profits from the film, and that no further crowdfunding campaigns could be created.\n\nIn August 2018, it was announced that a short fan film titled \"Georgie\", based on the 1990 miniseries \"It\", was being produced. The short, directed by Ryan Grulich and produced by John Campopiano, features Tony Dakota reprising his role as Georgie Denbrough from the miniseries, and centers on the idea of how the narrative of \"It\" may have continued had Georgie not been killed by Pennywise. The short also features Ben Heller, who portrayed young Stanley Uris in the miniseries. \"Georgie\" premiered at the Boston Underground Film Festival on March 22, 2019 and had its online premiere on June 10, 2019 on the \"Fangoria\" Facebook page.\n\nBatman Dracula was a fan made movie made by Andy Warhol. While some scenes where shown in the 2016 documentary Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis , the film is lost on most part.\n\nAs media scholar Henry Jenkins points out, fan films are shaped by the intersection between contemporary trends toward media convergence and participatory culture. These films are hybrid by nature—neither fully commercial nor fully alternative. Fan films represent a potentially important third space between the two.\n\nSimilarly, Stanford Law Professor Lawrence Lessig argued that for the first time in history, creativity by default is subject to regulation due to growing intellectual property rights like copyright and trademark. This trend results in artists (like the fans mentioned in this article) needing the permission of the copyright owner to engage in mashups or acts of remixing. In Lessig's view, this new phenomena limits creativity. To help artists mitigate the chilling impact of copyright law, Lessig founded the Creative Commons and proposed the Creative Commons licenses.\n"}

The Revolution were based in Allen and Frisco, Texas, within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nFounded in 2000 as the Arkansas Twisters, the Little Rock-based team played 10 seasons in af2 before that league folded. The team jumped to the Indoor Football League as the Arkansas Diamonds for the 2010 season. Remaining in the IFL, the team moved to Texas to become the Allen Wranglers for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. In 2012, former NFL standout and future hall of famer Terrell Owens played eight games for the Wranglers before being cut in late May.\n\nIn 2012, the Wranglers franchise was transferred to a new ownership group and the team was renamed the Texas Revolution for the 2013 season. After five seasons in the IFL, the team moved to the Champions Indoor Football league for that circuit's inaugural season.\n\nThe franchise began play as the Arkansas Twisters in 2000 as the only professional football team in the state of Arkansas. The team played 10 seasons as a charter member of af2, the \"developmental\" league of the original Arena Football League. The Twisters played their home games at Verizon Arena in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The team enjoyed success on the field, twice reaching the league's championship game. After the AFL took a season off and was forced into bankruptcy in 2009, the af2 was dissolved and the Twisters were announced as a planned charter member of Arena Football 1.\n\nConcerns for stability with Arena Football 1 lead to a November 2009 shift by Arkansas to the Indoor Football League. However, the rights to the Twisters name and logo belonged to Arena Football 1 so the Arkansas franchise held a \"name the team\" contest in late January and became the Arkansas Diamonds of the IFL's Intense Conference for the 2010 season. The new team colors for 2010 were Carolina blue, black, and gray. Arena football veteran Danton Barto took over as head coach, leading the team to an 11-3 regular season record and first place in the 2010 Lonestar East Division. The team's playoff run ended with a loss to the Billings Outlaws in the Intense Conference Finals. With the team struggling financially, co-owners Jim Smith and Jeff Everetts announced in September 2009 that the franchise was relocating to Allen, Texas, a prosperous suburb of Dallas.\n\nAfter a name-the-team contest, the team announced on September 29, 2010, it would be called the Allen Wranglers, starting with the 2011 Indoor Football League season. The relocated Intense Conference team would play their home games at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas. The team shared the name with a previous indoor football team in Allen, the Texas Wranglers, who played the 2009 and 2010 seasons in the Independent Indoor Football Alliance.\nIn October 2010, the team announced that Chris MacKeown would be the Wranglers' head coach for the 2011 season. Former Dallas Cowboys player Drew Pearson was named general manager of the franchise in early December 2010. The team finished with a 10-4 regular season record and first place in the Lonestar Division. They advanced through two rounds of the IFL playoffs before losing the Intense Conference Championship to the Tri-Cities Fever of Kennewick, Washington.\nThe Wranglers started the 2012 season strong under new head coach Pat Pimmell but after consecutive losses dropped their record to 5-3 in April, Pimmel was let go and the team's offensive and defensive coordinators shared the title \"co-interim head coach\" through the end of the season. The team finished with a 9-5 regular season record and reached the IFL playoffs but lost in the Intense Conference semi-finals to the Wichita Wild.\n\nNational attention was focused on the Wranglers in 2012 when NFL veteran wide receiver Terrell Owens joined the team. Recovering from surgery and receiving no offers from NFL teams, Owens accepted a generous contract and partial ownership in the franchise to play in Allen. He swelled attendance at Wranglers home games. His debut drew a crowd of 5,711 people, larger than the Wranglers' home attendance for the entire 2011 season, but his contract allowed him to skip many away dates. Owens was released by the Wranglers on May 29, 2012, with three games left in the season, for his \"lack of effort both on and off the field\", failure to show up for a scheduled appearance at a children's hospital, and refusal to play in two upcoming road games, Along with his release, Owens also relinquished his ownership stake in the team.\n\nIn June 2012, Wranglers owner Jon Frankel ceased operations of the team. The IFL then transferred franchise ownership to a new ownership group called Championship Sports Group led by CEO Tommy Benizio, the former IFL commissioner, with co-owners in Tim Brown and Ken Paxton. On September 19, 2012, the team unveiled its new name and colors as the Texas Revolution. After three seasons in the Intense Conference, the team was realigned to the United Conference for the 2013 season. In November 2012, the team named Billy Back as head coach for the 2013 season.\nAfter a disappointing 5–9 campaign, the Revolution released head coach Billy Back and hired Chris Williams from the New Mexico Stars. The league released its 2014 schedule in late October 2013 with the Revolution staying in the United Conference but the Chicago franchise replaced by the Bemidji Axemen in the 9-team IFL. The team re-signed several key players for 2014 and, in mid-January, announced the signing of running back Jennifer Welter as the first female professional football player for a position other than kicker. The team finished with a 3–11 record, missing the post-season, and head coach Chris Williams resigned after the season.\nIn late August 2014, the team hired former Dallas Cowboys cornerback Wendell Davis as head coach and director of football operations. Days later, the team announced it was leaving the Indoor Football League for the new Champions Indoor Football. The team's 2015 schedule began with a pre-season home game on February 27 and two regular season road games before the home opener on March 20. On March 30, after just four regular season games, the team released Wendell Davis and promoted defensive coordinator Devin Wyman to head coach. The team made its best playoff run since moving to Allen, advancing to Champions Bowl I but falling to the Sioux City Bandits, 76–61. Later that year, a team and potential regional rival called the Mesquite Marshals were launched in nearby Mesquite for the 2016 season.\n\nIn 2017, the Revolution won Champions Bowl III. The team then relocated to Frisco, Texas, and the Dr Pepper Arena for the 2018 season. On April 9, 2018, Victor Mann returned as head coach. The team finished the 2018 season 5–7 but advanced as far as the conference championship, where they lost to the eventual league champion Duke City Gladiators 41–28.\n\nFor the 2019 season, the Revolution again moved to a new arena in the Ford Center at The Star, the Dallas Cowboys' practice facility, on a three-year lease. Sometime just prior to the start of the season, a new ownership group called Owner's Box Inc obtained the majority ownership of the team, keeping Benizio as the CEO. However, after three home games into the 2019 season, the Revolution cancelled their home game scheduled for May 4. The remainder of the team's home games were then cancelled as well and the Ford Center stated that the team's games would no longer be played there. On May 9, the team announced it had ceased operations after the new ownership failed to back its financial obligations.\n\nThe following Revolution players have been named to All-IFL Teams:\n\n\n"}

Albany was granted an expansion team in 2002 and began play as the Albany Conquest. The Firebirds play their home games at the Times Union Center. They are the second arena football team for Albany, as the city was granted an expansion team, the Albany Firebirds, in the Arena Football League in 1990. The team moved to Indianapolis, Indiana in 2000 and played as the Indiana Firebirds through 2004 before disbanding.\n\nThen the city of Albany ventured into the world of arena football again, this time joining the Arena Football League 2 in 2002, creating a new franchise by the name the Albany Conquest. The team enjoyed little success and in 2009 for marketing purposes changed their name back to the Albany FireBirds before disbanding in 2010. They cited low attendance and poor fan support.\nDue to financial difficulties and low support, the Conquest were expected to fold following the 2008 season when a new investor could not be found. The franchise had notified the league in late September that it would not return, but following a meeting with the \"Albany Times Union\" and the operator of the Times Union Center, an agreement was reached that would allow the team to return for 2009. The team also acquired the rights to the old Firebirds name and logo in a rebranding effort to raise interest in the team, hoping to bring back fans from the days of the original Firebirds team.\n\nOn April 28, 2009, it was announced that the Albany Firebirds had offered former NFL quarterback Michael Vick a contract. Under the terms of this contract, Vick would be required to donate $100,000 to a local animal shelter.\n\nThe following day, the team retracted the announcement, claiming that it had been a publicity stunt created by the team's marketing department. The team's owner, Walter Robb, who knew nothing of the stunt, was cited as saying, \"I’m a dog lover and I don’t want anything to do with (Vick).\"\n\nIn a September 2016 article in \"Sports Illustrated\", it was discovered that the Conquest/Firebirds almost became known as the Albany WarBirds. In 2001, 20-year-old college students Jason Klein and Casey White of branding firm Brandiose were chosen to come up with a new catchy name for a new franchise for Albany. The name that was chosen was the \"WarBirds\" and logos, helmet and uniform designs were created. They filed for a trademark on August 15 and set September 12 as the day to unveil the name, logo and uniforms. Then, the September 11th attacks occurred in New York City, The Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. It was then determined that all parties involved agreed that the concept, which Klein described as a “weaponized airplane,” would have to go. The “Empire” was the frontrunner for the new team name but they ran into a trademark issue, so they eventually settled on “Conquest.” However, in 2018, the current AFL franchise became known as the Albany Empire with no trademark issues.\n\n!Totals || 60 || 72 || 0\n\n"}

The Blizzard began play in the Indoor Football League in 2010, after having played the previous seven seasons in af2, the now-defunct minor league of the Arena Football League. They play their home games at the Resch Center in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin. The team's logo represents Bruiser, the team mascot.\n\nThe Blizzard started out as an af2 expansion team in 2003 with Jose Jefferson as the team's head coach. The team finished 2–14, last in the National Conference Midwest Division. They only averaged 2,957 fans a game.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2004 season, the Blizzard replaced Jose Jefferson with former Green Bay Packers linebacker Brian Noble. Despite the team improving during the 2004 season, the Blizzard finished 6–10.\n\nIn 2005, the team moved from the National Conference to the American Conference of AF2. The Blizzard became a member of the American Conference's East division. The team also replaced Noble with veteran Arena Football League Bob Landsee. The team continued their trend of improvement in 2005 finishing 9–7, good for 3rd in the East Division, and reaching the postseason for the first time. They fell in the first round to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.\n\nBlizzard head coach Bob Landsee became the first coach in team history to return for their second season. The Blizzard also came under new ownership as former coach Brian Noble lead an investment group that purchased the team. Noble became the new President of the four-year-old franchise and began a complete revitalization of the organization, drastically lowering ticket prices in an attempt to boost their average game attendance. The team set a new single game attendance record of 7,184 in the season finale against Louisville. The team experienced an improvement on the field as well, going into the final game of the 2006 regular season tied with the Louisville Fire for first in the East Division at 9–6. This set up a showdown between the two teams at the Resch Center for the East Division title, which the Blizzard won 54–53. The Blizzard earned a first round bye before facing the 2005 ArenaCup Champion Memphis Xplorers in the Blizzard's inaugural home playoff game, which they won 67–50. This victory sent them to the American Conference Championship Game against the Florida Firecats, which they won 60–47, capturing the conference title and advancing to ArenaCup VII, where they lost to the Spokane Shock 54–37.\n\nCoach Bob Landsee had difficulties resulting from surgery and was forced to take a leave of absence for the 2007 season. He was replaced by defensive coordinator Doug Lytle, who led the Blizzard to a 9–7 season, remaining undefeated at home yet losing all but one road game. The Blizzard made the playoffs for the third consecutive year and surprised their rival and Midwest Division Champion Quad City Steamwheelers 39–34 in the first round game. The Blizzard carried over their success at home from the regular season by defeating Louisville in the second round 37–27, but lost to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers in their second consecutive American Conference championship game, 46–43.\n\nHead coach Bob Landsee returned in 2008 and led the Blizzard to an 11–5 record and a Midwest Division title. The Blizzard set a single game record for attendance against Lexington with 7,258 and had the largest average attendance in team history with an average of 6,125 fans per game. In the first round of the playoffs the Blizzard defeated Lexington 65–37 after having lost twice to them in the regular season. The Blizzard then hosted Manchester in a second round game, losing 55–54 on a last minute Manchester two-point conversion.\n\nAfter beginning the season by defeating the defending ArenaCup Champion Tennessee Valley Vipers. The Blizzard failed to capture a consecutive Midwest Division title and finished the season 10–6, earning the #6 seed in the 2009 af2 playoffs. The Blizzard advanced to their third American Conference Championship, losing to #1 seed Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers 72–67.\n\nIn October 2009, the team announced that unless the team found additional investors that they would be forced to cease operations. The Blizzard found new investors in an ownership group named Titletown Football Group, LLC, led by Green Bay Bullfrogs president Jeff Royle, who purchased the team in late October. In November 2009, the team announced that they would play the 2010 season in the Indoor Football League (IFL) due to AF2 filing for bankruptcy. At a team open house on November 17, 2009, the Blizzard announced their new head coach would be Rik Richards.\n\nOn December 5, 2009, the Blizzard announced a name-the-team contest. The Blizzard name and intellectual property was held by the then-defunct Arena Football League (AFL), which was the parent of the Blizzard's former league, af2. The assets of the former AFL were purchased by the newly formed Arena Football 1. The team ownership group was still attempting to purchase the rights to the Blizzard name and had decided to continue with the contest in case the Blizzard name was not able to be purchased, but the owners were able to acquire the Blizzard name and imagery.\n\nOn December 15, 2009, the IFL announced the divisional alignment and schedule for the 2010 season. The Blizzard competed in the United Conference, Central North Division with the La Crosse Spartans, Chicago Slaughter and Bloomington Extreme. The Blizzard won the Central North Division, but lost their first round playoff game against the Chicago Slaughter.\n\nFor the 2011 season, the Blizzard competed in the United Conference, Great Lakes Division, which was a renamed Central North Division (the Spartans, Slaughter, and Extreme, along with the Blizzard). The Blizzard won the division title again and improved to 11–3 record. They defeated the Reading Express in their first round playoff game, but lost the United Conference Championship game to the eventual champions, the Sioux Falls Storm.\nBecause of various teams leaving the IFL, either to join other leagues or cease operations altogether, the league played the 2012 season format in two conferences with no divisions. While the Spartans had ceased operations, the Blizzard's divisional rivals, the Slaughter and the newly renamed Bloomington Edge joined in the single-table United Conference along with the Reading Express, Sioux Falls Storm, Cedar Rapids Titans, Lehigh Valley Steelhawks and Omaha Beef. The Blizzard finished 11–3 again, for second place in the conference and three games behind the undefeated Storm. The Blizzard defeated the Edge in the first round, but again lost to the Storm for the United Conference Championship.\n\nWith the Beef, Edge, and Steelhawks leaving the IFL for other leagues and the Express suspending operations, the United Conference was reduced to five teams for the 2013 season, with the Blizzard, Slaughter, Titans, and Storm all returning and the newly renamed Texas Revolution (formerly the Allen Wranglers) moving from the Intense Conference. Junior Aumavae, a nose tackle who spent the 2012 season playing for the Blizzard, was signed by the New York Jets in late March 2013. After compiling a 1–5 record in the season's first six games, head coach Robert Fuller was replaced by defensive coordinator Chad Baldwin.\nAfter the 2013 season, the Chicago Slaughter moved to the Continental Indoor Football League, but the United Conference continued to have five teams with the expansion Bemidji Axemen. In September 2013, Titletown Football Group, LLC sold their majority ownership stake in the team to Larry and Kathy Treankler. The Blizzard began the 2014 season under head coach Chad Baldwin. After the team began the season 0–6, Baldwin was replaced by offensive coordinator Tommie Williams for the remainder of the season. The Blizzard introduced their new logo during this season.\nTommie Williams had his interim tag removed and was named the head coach of the Blizzard. The Blizzard brought back veteran quarterback Donovan Porterie and traded for Carl Sims. The Blizzard won as many games as they had the previous two seasons combined, but their 6–8 record was not enough to qualify for the playoffs.\nOn November 3, 2015, Williams and the Blizzard agreed to part ways. On December 7, 2015, Chris Williams was hired as the head coach of the Blizzard.\nTo open the 2018 season, the Blizzard started out 0–5 after a bad showing with the I-Formation. Coach Chris Williams was relieved of his duties following the week 6 bye and was replaced by Corey Roberson as interim head coach. The Blizzard finished the season with two total wins.\n\nCorey Roberson was named head coach for the 2019 season.

{"id": "1956560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956560", "title": "Nicholas Throckmorton", "text": "Nicholas Throckmorton\n\nSir Nicholas Throckmorton (or Throgmorton) (c. 1515/1516 – 12 February 1571) was an English diplomat and politician, who was an ambassador to France and later Scotland, and played a key role in the relationship between Elizabeth I of England and Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nNicholas Throckmorton was the fourth of eight sons of Sir George Throckmorton of Coughton Court, near Alcester in Warwickshire and Katherine, daughter of Nicholas Vaux, 1st Baron Vaux of Harrowden and Elizabeth FitzHugh, the former Lady Parr. Nicholas was an uncle of the conspirator Francis Throckmorton. He was brought up in the households of members of the Parr family, including that of his cousin Catherine Parr, the last queen consort of Henry VIII. He got acquainted with young Lady Elizabeth when he was serving in the household of the dowager queen and her new husband Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley and became a close confidant. In his youth, he also became favourable to the Protestant Reformation.\n\nAfter the execution of Lord Thomas Seymour in 1549 and the downfall of Protector Somerset later in the year, Throckmorton managed to distance himself from those affairs and eventually became the part of the circle of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland and confidant of the young king Edward VI.\n\nHe sat in Parliament from 1545 to 1567, initially as the member for Maldon and then from 1547 for Devizes (a seat previously held by his brother Clement Throckmorton). During the reign of Edward VI, he was in high favour with the regents.\n\nIn 1547, he was present at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh during the invasion of Scotland. He was knighted in 1551, and the title included numerous benefits, including land grants, that gave him financial security. He held the post of under-treasurer at the Tower mint from 1549 to 1552. In March 1553, he was elected knight of the shire for Northamptonshire and then MP for Old Sarum (Nov 1553), Lyme Regis (1559) and Tavistock (1563).\n\nDuring the short-lived attempt to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne after the death of Edward VI in 1553, Throckmorton tried to keep contact with both supporters of both her and Queen Mary I. Eventually, he began to support the latter. \n\nHowever, in January 1554, he was suspected of complicity in Wyatt's Rebellion and arrested. Later historians have suspected he was at least involved, either because of his Protestantism or due to his dismay at the growing Spanish influence in the court.\n\nThrockmorton was brought to trial at the Guildhall on 17 April 1554. He managed to convince the jury, which included Simon Lowe alias Fyfield, of his innocence, although the judges were openly hostile to him. They included Sir Roger Cholmeley, who was trying to impress Queen Mary. As a result of the verdict, the court fined and imprisoned the jury and sent Throckmorton to the Tower. When he was released the next year, he fled to exile in France. Though people wanted to put him on trial again, he was pardoned in 1557, and was employed by Queen Mary.\n\nAfter Elizabeth's accession in November 1558, Throckmorton rose rapidly into favour because of his personal acquaintance with her. He sent her advice on the formation of her government, some of which she followed and from May 1559 to April 1564, he was ambassador to France. He was appointed both Chief Butler of England and Chamberlain of the Exchequer in 1564 for life. He continued to send letters and messengers with advice to the Queen and she often took his advice.\n\nThrockmorton acknowledged that Elizabeth had a central and active role in government, and August 1560 he wrote to Elizabeth that peace between England and Scotland \"dothe cheffely depend uppon your majesties order & conducte.\" During these years in France, Throckmorton became acquainted with Mary, Queen of Scots. He conducted the negotiations with the English court regarding her travel arrangements when she decided to return to Scotland from France. Though he supported the Reformation, he became her close friend, willing to assist her, and do her personal favours.\n\nAs an ambassador, Throckmorton encouraged Elizabeth to aid the Huguenots, and he surreptitiously took a part in the war of religion. Throckmorton was allowed leave from his duties in October 1559 to visit his sick wife in England. Henry Killigrew was left as his deputy. When Throckmorton returned to France in 1560, the Roman Catholic leader Francis, Duke of Guise imprisoned him as a \"persona non grata\". Guise was convinced that Throckmorton had been involved with the Tumult of Amboise, a Huguenot plot. Throckmorton later remarked that he was afraid he would be killed, but he was released and retained his post as an ambassador.\n\nIn 1562, when religious violence began to intensify in France, Throckmorton wanted to support the mediation efforts of Catherine de' Medici. Later in 1562, when the Huguenot Prince of Condé had taken over Newhaven (modern-day Le Havre) in April, Throckmorton convinced the Queen to send military aid to the Huguenots in what was later called the Newhaven expedition. English troops garrisoned Le Havre in October 1562, but soon fell afoul of the Huguenots and, after the negotiations, the Huguenots turned against the English. After an outbreak of plague, they had to surrender the next year. Catherine de' Medici was suspicious of Throckmorton's schemes, however, and when Elizabeth sent him to negotiate with her in 1563, she placed him under house arrest. Elizabeth sent Sir Thomas Smith to negotiate his release. The two men soon began to dislike each other and in one stage almost came to blows, but Throckmorton was eventually released in 1564.\n\nAfter Throckmorton's return to England, the Queen sent him as an ambassador to Scotland in May 1565. His mission was to prevent the marriage of Queen Mary and Darnley, but he failed. After the murder of Darnley, Elizabeth sent Throckmorton to Scotland in June 1567. The Scottish lords had rebelled and captured Mary at Carberry Hill, and Elizabeth wished the lords to restore Mary to her authority. Throckmorton himself had recommended that Elizabeth should support the lords. On 25 July, William Maitland of Lethington came to see Throckmorton. \n\nAs instructed by Elizabeth, Throckmorton asked Lethington if the plan was to restore Mary to the throne. \nIf so, Elizabeth promised to help prosecute Darnley's murder and preserve Prince James. Throckmorton recorded Lethington's personal answer, which outlined that English interference was not welcome at this time, and might even be counterproductive, and Throckmorton would not be allowed to see Mary;\"Being in place to knowe more than you can knowe, I saye unto yowe ..., in case you doe on the Quenes majesties behalf your mestris, presse this company to enlarge the Quene my soveraigne, and to suffer you to goe unto her (at Lochleven Castle), or doe use any thretnynge speache in those matters, the rather to compasse them (\"rather than achieve them\"), I assure you, you wyll put the Quene my soveraigne in greate jeopardye of her lyffe: and therefore there is none other waye for the present to do her good but to give place and use mildness.\"\n\nElizabeth repeated her instructions to Throckmorton by letter on 27 July 1567. Elizabeth told Throckmorton he should argue that the lords had deposed Mary against scriptural law, citing Paul's letter to the Romans. Elizabeth noted that as she planned not to send financial aid to the rebel lords, there was a risk they might renew the Auld Alliance with France. Throckmorton was not to give confirmation to the rebellion by attending the coronation of the infant Prince James.\n\nThrockmorton was working against his own advice and had contradictory orders from both his Queen and Sir William Cecil. The Scottish lords knew him as a friend of Mary and as a supporter of her claim to be a successor to Elizabeth, so he was an unwelcome guest. Some of Elizabeth's messages also offended the lords. Throckmorton was recalled in August after he offended Elizabeth by showing his instructions to the Scottish lords.\n\nIn 1569, Throckmorton was suspected of involvement in the Duke of Norfolk's conspiracy in favour of Mary, and was imprisoned for a time at Windsor. Throckmorton may have erroneously believed Norfolk's idea would suit the wishes of the Queen. He was not put to trial, but did not regain the Queen's confidence afterwards.\nThrockmorton died on 12 February 1571. He is buried in St Katharine Cree parish church, Leadenhall Street, London.\n\nThrockmorton married Anne Carew, daughter of Sir Nicholas Carew, a Knight of the Garter and his wife Elizabeth Bryan, and they had 10 sons and three daughters. Their daughter Elizabeth became the wife of Sir Walter Raleigh. After his death, Anne married Adrian Stokes, the second husband, and former Master of Horse of, Frances Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk.\n\nContemporary political figures regarded Throckmorton with respect. One of these was Sir Francis Walsingham who had worked with Throckmorton in France. In 1560 William Cecil said he would be prepared to resign if Throckmorton would take his place and spoke well of him after his death, in spite of their constant disagreements. Some contemporaries also suspected Throckmorton was the \"éminence grise\" behind Robert Dudley.\n\nAt the time of his death, Throckmorton held the posts of the keeper of Brigstock Park, Northamptonshire; Justice of the Peace in Northamptonshire; and Chief Butler of England and Wales. London's Throgmorton Street is named after him.\n\n"}

The team was part of the East Division in the American conference. The Pioneers were an expansion team for the league's 2002 season, and were the runners-up in ArenaCup VIII and ArenaCup X.\n\nThe AF2 announced their expansion into the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area on July 24, 2001. Ownership would comprise a Baltimore-based group, Smith Sports International, and NFL legend Johnny Unitas. The team signed a 10-year lease with the First Union Arena at Casey Plaza (later Wachovia Arena and now Mohegan Sun Arena) and would begin play with the 2002 season in the league's Northeast Division. Terry Karg was hired as the team's first head coach.\n\nThe team name was chosen on September 20 following a name-the-team contest. Of over 1500 entries, the name Pioneers was chosen in recognition of the early settlers of Northeastern Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Pioneers got off to a shaky start in the AF2. The team took a 21-10 lead into halftime against the Greensboro Prowlers, but the Prowlers would come back to win the game 42-28, handing the Pioneers their first franchise loss and first loss at home. Wilkes-Barre/Scranton lost their next five games before finally taking a win against division rivals New Haven Ninjas in New Haven. With a 3-3 record following the win, the Pioneers were still in the playoff hunt and could secure a berth with a win against the Rochester Brigade or a loss by the Brigade to the Mohegan Wolves the following week. Both the Pioneers and Wolves lost, ending Wilkes-Barre/Scranton's hopes for a playoff spot. Their season came to a close with a 6-10 record.\n\nFollowing the season, head coach Karg resigned and left the Pioneers. Larry Kuharich, who had played for the AFL's Tampa Bay Storm and was running back coach for the New Orleans Saints, was hired as the team's second head coach.\n\nThe Pioneers’ second season got off to the same start that their first one did with an opening game loss to the Greensboro Prowlers. Soon afterwards, Coach Kuharich resigned as head coach to be replaced by Dean Cokinos. The Pioneers would finish the season with a 6-10 record, the same as in 2002, and without a spot in the playoffs.\n\nAttendance for home games fell in 2003. After averaging nearly 6200 fans per game in 2002, attendance dropped more than 1000 to average 4975 per game in 2003. The ownership blamed itself, rather than the product on the field, for moving games to Friday nights from Saturday nights; they vowed to return to Saturdays as often as possible in 2004.\n\nFollowing a tumultuous season that included the resignation of both the head coach and general manager, the Pioneers hired Les Moss, who had been working with the Orlando Predators of the AFL, as the team's fourth head coach.\n\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton's third season began on a noticeably different note than the previous two seasons. In a first-time matchup against the Columbus Wardogs, the Pioneers won their home and season opener. The team would continue to win, going 5-0 until suffering their first loss to the Albany Conquest. The Pioneers went on to lose only two more games, ending with a 13-3 record. They had not only secured a playoff spot, but they had won the Northeast Division and earned a first-round bye. Their first playoff game, against divisional rival Cape Fear Wildcats, resulted in a win, propelling them to the Conference Championships. The Pioneers would lose the championship game to the Florida Firecats, ending their first postseason run.\n\nFollowing their first playoff season, Coach Moss was named the AF2 Coach of the Year. He also signed on to coach the Pioneers in 2005, becoming the first Pioneers coach to remain for a second season.\n\nThe Pioneers returned to action in 2005 with nine players returning from the 2004 roster, including 2004 AF2 Rookie of the Year J. R. Thomas. With nine scores on ten possessions, the Pioneers won their season and home opener over the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgs. Wilkes-Barre/Scranton won two more games before 2004 starting quarterback Tim Hicks was traded to the Bossier-Shreveport Battle Wings. The Pioneers then suffered three straight losses and the loss of star receiver Thomas to a broken leg. The Pioneers would endure a further hardship with the hospitalization of coach Moss due to a \"weight-related issue\". Despite the problems, the Pioneers would finish fourth in the Eastern Division with a 9-7 record and clinched a wildcard playoff berth.\n\nWith a win over the Green Bay Blizzard, the Pioneers advanced to the Conference Semifinals to face Florida, the top-seeded team in the conference. Their championship aspirations would die in the second round in a 59-45 loss.\n\nFollowing the season, Coach Moss signed a three-year contract with the Orlando Predators as an assistant coach, leaving the Pioneers to find their fifth coach in as many seasons. Pittsburgh native Rich Ingold, former Quad City Steamwheelers coach and Dallas Desperados coordinator, was hired in this capacity for the 2006 season.\n\nIngold's first game with the Pioneers began with new quarterback Mike Granieri throwing two interceptions against the Louisville Fire; it ended with a score of 45-37 and a win. The Pioneers would continue their season-opening winning streak to 5-0 before losing to the Tulsa Talons. After two wins in the next four games, Ingold released receiver Thomas for \"insubordination\". A four-game losing streak would befall the team, but a victory over Albany in the season closer would propel them into the playoffs with a 9-7 record. Their season would end one week later, losing the first playoff round to Manchester.\n\nIn the offseason, the Pioneers signed former Penn State quarterback Zack Mills to lead the offense. However, Mills only spent four days training with the Pioneers before departing from the team, citing a waning passion for the game.\n\nFor the fourth straight season, the Pioneers opened with a win, this time against Manchester. In their second game, against the Cincinnati Jungle Kats expansion team, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton's 94-25 win set a team record for most points scored in a game; the 69 points of separation was also the fourth-highest margin of victory in league history. The Pioneers would extend their winning streak to 13 games before losing to Albany in week 16. They finished the regular season with a 14-2 record and home field advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\nThe Pioneers defeated the Tri-Cities Fever in the first round of the playoffs. In the second round, they emerged victorious over the Central Valley Coyotes to advance to their second-ever American Conference Championship, where they overcame defending conference champions Green Bay to advance to ArenaCup VIII. Playing against the Tulsa Talons, the only team in the league with a better record, the Pioneers lost the championship 73-66 on a dropped touchdown pass to end the game.\n\nIn 2008, the Pioneers began to reload to take another shot at the ArenaCup. The team re-signed several key players from the 2007 squad, including quarterback Ryan Vena. The season got off to a rocky start, however, when the team lost the season opener to the Quad City Steamwheelers. After winning handily over the Daytona Beach ThunderBirds, the Pioneers began their season at Wachovia Arena with a win over the Mahoning Valley Thunder. The Pioneers lost only one game in their division in 2008 and won all of their home matches, giving them seventeen straight regular season home victories dating back to the 2006 season. The Pioneers began their playoff run with a victory over the Steamwheelers but lost in the conference semifinals to eventual ArenaCup champion Tennessee Valley.\n\nThe 2009 campaign began in the same way the 2008 season did: rebuilding a strong team with the ArenaCup in sight. Several key players returned to the team in 2009, including Ryan Vena, David Davis, and Micheaux Robinson. The Pioneers began the season with two home wins over division opponents but dropped the Week 3 contest to the Kentucky Horsemen. The Pioneers lost only two other games in 2009, one to Tulsa and one to Spokane. Wilkes-Barre/Scranton also kept up the tradition of winning at home, racking up another perfect season at Wachovia Arena and extending their regular season home win streak to 25. The Pioneers locked up the Eastern Division crown for the third straight year and held homefield advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\nAll of the Pioneers playoff games would be rematches from the 2009 regular season. The team took easy wins over Albany and Kentucky and won a nail-biter against Green Bay to advance to the ArenaCup. The Pioneers took a tie game into halftime against the Spokane Shock in the ArenaCup, but the game ended in disappointment again; the Pioneers were denied the ArenaCup.\n\nShortly after the Pioneers lost ArenaCup X, owner Cosmo DeNicola announced that he had put the team up for sale. DeNicola, a resident of the Philadelphia area, cited his other business responsibilities and length of time away from home during the AF2 season as the reasons for putting the team on the market. He had hoped that an owner could be found in northeast Pennsylvania to keep the team in Wilkes-Barre and that an owner could be found in time to field a team for the 2010 season. No one was found to step in as owner, and the team announced that it was in the process of shutting down the team offices and would not field a team in 2010, though any potential investors were still encouraged to step up and begin negotiations to purchase the franchise. (As it would turn out, the entire league would disband in 2010, with several of its teams \"moving up\" into a reorganized, one-tier Arena Football League that year.)\n\nIn multiple episodes of the American television comedy, \"The Office\", Michael Scott and other characters are seen wearing Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers sweatshirts and undershirts. \"The Office\" takes place in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Also in some episodes, the gold AFL football with the blue stripe is seen on some of the employees' desks.\n\n!Totals || 93 || 50 || 0\n\n\n"}

They were a charter member of the AF2 and played their home games at iWireless Center in Moline, Illinois.\n\nThe team was founded on September 1, 1999 when the Quad Cities was awarded an arena football franchise. Managing owner (and inventor of arena football) Jim Foster coined the team's nickname.\n\nIn December 2009, it was confirmed that the Steamwheelers had ceased operations, opting not to join the new Arena Football League after the bankruptcy of the Arena Football League and subsequent disbanding of af2.\n\nThe Steamwheelers played their inaugural season in 2000 and dominated the league for its first two seasons. They went undefeated in 2000 behind coach Frank Haege, even winning one game by a score of 103-3 over Greensboro in Greensboro, en route to capturing the first-ever ArenaCup Championship. In 2001, the Steamwheelers nearly repeated that accomplishment by finishing 18-1 and winning a second-straight league title. During this two season span, the Steamwheelers set a record for the longest winning streak in the af2 at 24 consecutive wins.\n\nAllegations of rules violations plagued the Steamwheelers during the second season and they were eventually banned from the 2002 playoffs for salary cap violations under Haege.\n\nCoached by Rich Ingold from 2002–2004, the Steamwheelers were still successful as they clinched two more division titles. However, the team failed to win any additional league championships and lost 14 games over that three-year span.

{"id": "1956575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956575", "title": "Remembrance Day bombing", "text": "Remembrance Day bombing\n\nThe Remembrance Day bombing (also known as the Enniskillen bombing or Poppy Day massacre) took place on 8 November 1987 in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. A Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb exploded near the town's war memorial (cenotaph) during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony, which was being held to commemorate British military war dead. Eleven people (ten civilians and a police officer) were killed, many of them elderly, and 63 were injured. The IRA said it had made a mistake and that its target had been the British soldiers parading to the memorial.\n\nThe bombing was strongly condemned by all sides and undermined support for the IRA and Sinn Féin. It also facilitated the passing of the Extradition Act, which made it easier to extradite IRA suspects from the Republic of Ireland to the United Kingdom. Loyalist paramilitaries responded to the bombing with revenge attacks on Catholic civilians. The bombing is often seen as a turning point in the Troubles, an incident that shook the IRA \"to its core\", and spurred on new efforts by Irish nationalists towards a political solution to the conflict.\n\nThe IRA said that the bombing was an attempt to kill British soldiers. It has also been suggested that it was partly a retaliation for the alleged harassment of republican memorial services by the security forces. A week before the bombing, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) clashed with mourners at the funeral of IRA volunteers Eddie McSheffrey and Paddy Deery. When an IRA gunman fired a three-volley salute over the coffins, police baton charged and fired plastic bullets into the crowd. One of the coffins was knocked to the ground and a number of civilians and officers were injured.\n\nThe bombing was thought by the British and Irish security forces to have involved at least two IRA units, from both sides of the border. Although IRA units were given \"a degree of operational autonomy\" at the time, they believed that such a bombing must have been sanctioned by IRA Northern Command. However, a high-ranking IRA member said that it was suggested by IRA men at the local level and sanctioned by a \"middle level\" officer. \n\nDenzil McDaniel, author of \"Enniskillen: The Remembrance Sunday Bombing\", later interviewed security and IRA contacts, putting together an account of the bombers' movements. He wrote that the bomb was made in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, and brought to Enniskillen by up to thirty IRA volunteers, moving in relay teams to avoid security patrols. It is thought to have taken over 24 hours to transport the bomb. On the night of 7 November, the bomb—hidden in a sports bag—was left at the gable wall inside the town's Reading Rooms, and set to explode at 10:43AM the next day, minutes before the ceremony was to start. The security forces searched the route of the planned military parade for explosives, but did not search the Reading Rooms as it was thought to be a \"secure area\".\n\nThe bomb exploded as a parade of Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers was making its way to the memorial and as people waited for the ceremony to begin. It blew out the wall of the Reading Rooms, where many of the victims were standing, burying them under rubble and hurling masonry towards the gathered crowd. Bystanders rushed to free those trapped underneath.\n\nEleven people were killed, including three married couples. The dead were Wesley and Bertha Armstrong (aged 62 and 55), Kit and Jessie Johnston (aged 71 and 62), William and Agnes Mullan (aged 74 and 73), John Megaw (67), Alberta Quinton (72), Marie Wilson (20), Samuel Gault (49) and Edward Armstrong (52). Edward Armstrong was a serving RUC officer and Gault had recently left the force. Gordon Wilson, whose daughter Marie died in the blast and who was himself injured, went on to become a peace campaigner and member of Seanad Éireann. The twelfth fatality, Ronnie Hill, died after spending 13 years in a coma. Sixty-three people were injured, including thirteen children, some of them permanently. Ulster Unionist politicians Sammy Foster and Jim Dixon were among the crowd; the latter received extensive head injuries but recovered. A local businessman captured the immediate aftermath of the bombing on video camera. His footage, showing the effects of the bombing, was broadcast on international television. All the victims were Protestant.\n\nA few hours after the blast, the IRA called a radio station and said it had abandoned a bomb in Tullyhommon, away, after it failed to detonate. That morning, a Remembrance Sunday parade (which included many members of the Boys' and Girls' Brigades) had unwittingly gathered near the Tullyhommon bomb. Soldiers and RUC officers had also been there, and the IRA said it attempted to trigger the bomb when soldiers were standing beside it. It was defused by security forces and was found to have a command wire leading to a firing point across the border.\n\nThe IRA apologised, saying it had made a mistake and that the target had been the UDR soldiers who were parading to the memorial. \n\nDenzil McDaniel, author of \"Enniskillen: The Remembrance Sunday Bombing\", commented: \"I don't believe the IRA set out to specifically kill civilians. I think they made mistakes, probably with their intelligence on the timetable for the service, but the IRA was reckless about civilian life\". RUC Detective Chief Superintendent Norman Baxter said: \"Their intention was to inflict casualties. The only mistake in the operation was that the bomb went off before the parade arrived\". Many Irish nationalists and Republicans were horrified by the bombing and described it as a blow to the Republican cause. Sinn Féin's weekly newspaper, \"An Phoblacht\", criticised the bombing, calling it a \"monumental error\" that would strengthen the IRA's opponents. The IRA disbanded the unit responsible.\n\nThe bombing led to an outcry among politicians in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said: \"It's really desecrating the dead and a blot on mankind\". The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, denounced the \"outrage\" in the House of Commons, as did the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Lenihan in Dáil Éireann (the lower house of the Oireachtas, the Republic's legislature), while in Seanad Éireann Senator Maurice Manning spoke of people's \"total revulsion\". Many public figures used terms such as \"barbarism\" and \"savagery\" to describe the bombing.\n\nThe bombing was seen by many Northern Irish Protestants as an attack on them, and loyalist paramilitaries retaliated with attacks on Catholic civilians. The day after, five Catholic teenagers were wounded in a shooting in Belfast, and a Protestant teenager was killed by the Ulster Defence Association after being mistaken for a Catholic. In the week after the bombing, there were 14 gun and bomb attacks on Catholics in Belfast.\n\nIrish band U2 were holding a concert in Denver, Colorado, US the same day. During a performance of their song \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", singer Bono passionately condemned the bombing, stating \"fuck the revolution\" in his mid-song speech, as well as criticising the armchair republicanism of many Irish-Americans and stating that the majority of people in his country did not want \"the revolution\". The footage is included in U2's rockumentary \"Rattle and Hum\". Simple Minds had a number 1 single in the UK with Belfast Child, inspired by the bombing.\n\nAt the time, the British and Irish governments were negotiating an Extradition Act that would make it easier to extradite IRA suspects from the Republic to the UK. The Act was to come before the Irish parliament less than a month after the bombing. The Irish government wanted the British to reform the justice system in Northern Ireland (such as by abolishing \"Diplock courts\") before it would pass the Act. Many in the Republic insisted that the Act should only be passed after the reforms took place. However, after the bombing, opposition to the Act dwindled and it was passed by the Irish Parliament, albeit with some changes.\n\nThe bombing is often seen as a turning point in the Troubles. It undermined support for the IRA's campaign, both locally and internationally. Crucially, the Gaddafi regime in Libya withdrew its support and with it the supply of weapons and ammunition to the IRA. The bombing also harmed Sinn Féin's electoral support. In 1989, in the first local elections held after the bombing, Sinn Féin lost four of its eight seats on Fermanagh District Council and was overtaken by the SDLP as the biggest Irish nationalist party there. It was not until 2001, fourteen years after the bombing, that Sinn Féin support returned to its 1985 level. The bombing drove new efforts by Irish nationalists towards a political solution to the conflict. It led to the resumption of talks between Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams and SDLP leader John Hume, paving the way for formal talks between the two parties and the beginnings of the Northern Ireland peace process. In 1997, Adams apologised for the bombing on behalf of the republican movement.\n\nEnniskillen's Remembrance Day service was re-staged two weeks after the bombing, and attended by about 5,000 people, including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The site of the bomb, which was owned by the Catholic Church, was rebuilt as The Clinton Centre, a youth hostel, in 2002. The hostel was opened by and named after former US President Bill Clinton.\n\nUnder the Thirty-year rule, a letter sent after the bombing was released by the Irish Government. The author was anonymous but claimed to be working for MI5, and the letter was sent to then tánaiste and minister for foreign affairs, Brian Lenihan. It claimed that MI5 had advance knowledge of the Remembrance Day bombing but allowed it to go ahead, so that the public could turn against the Provisional IRA and new security measures could be justified.\n\n"}

{"id": "1956581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956581", "title": "Pietro Raimondi", "text": "Pietro Raimondi\n\nPietro Raimondi (December 20, 1786, Rome – October 30, 1853) was an Italian composer, transitional between the Classical and Romantic eras. While he was famous at the time as a composer of operas and sacred music, he was also as an innovator in contrapuntal technique as well as in creation of gigantic musical simultaneities.\n\nRaimondi was born in Rome, and received his early education in Naples. He spent part of his early career in Genoa, and then in Sicily, where he had operas performed in Catania and Messina; however he moved back to Naples in 1820, and began a career as an opera composer there. While he was best known as an opera composer during this time, he was obsessed with counterpoint, and spent his spare time writing fugues for many voices, as well as simultaneous fugues in different keys and modes for multiple groups of different instruments. He considered this work to be experimental, and did not incorporate his experimentation, early in his career, into his operas.\n\nFew of Raimondi's operas were successful, and as soon as he realized he was being eclipsed by Rossini, and later by Bellini and Donizetti, he changed his compositional direction from production of operas to sacred music; in that domain he had a better opportunity to indulge his love of counterpoint. He published a counterpoint treatise in 1836, around the same time as the first of his experimental compositions for multiple choruses and orchestras; from this year forward he devoted most of his energies to such creations. However he had not forgotten his previous career as an operatic composer, and made a few last attempts to achieve a success on the operatic stage.\n\nOne of the most spectacular of his experiments in musical simultaneity was his triple oratorio, \"Putifar-Giuseppe-Giacobbe\" (1848). This work was a set of three independent oratorios designed to be performed first consecutively, and then \"simultaneously\", one of the few such experiments before the music of Charles Ives in the twentieth century. Unlike the music of Ives, however, Raimondi's musical language was conservative, even anachronistic, using only the tonal language of the eighteenth century. The parts of the oratorios were designed to fit together tightly, all obeying the standard rules of counterpoint. The triple oratorio was first performed in Rome in 1852, in a concert lasting six hours, and requiring 430 performers. According to the contemporary account, Raimondi was so overcome with the colossal sound of the three oratorios together at the end that he fainted, and the concert caused the sensation he had desired for so long. As a result of this success he was honored by the Pope, receiving from him the position of \"maestro di cappella\" at St. Peter's, a level of acknowledgement he had never achieved in the operatic realm.\n\nRaimondi followed the triple oratorio with the composition of a double opera, one serious and one comical, which like the triple oratorio was designed to be performed either consecutively or simultaneously. This work (\"Adelasia/I quattro rustici\") was left incomplete at his death in 1853; however, much of the orchestration, counterpoint, and many of the scene changes had been worked out. As conceived, each opera would have served as a commentary on the other. This double opera has never been completed or staged, and along with Raimondi's other late music is an example of an experimental trend in the middle nineteenth century which was never followed up by anyone else.\n\nIn his actual musical language, Raimondi was conservative, and his simultaneities work by following traditional rules of counterpoint, as well as by staying in a limited tonal universe.\n\nRaimondi makes a dramatic appearance in Michael Ayrton's satirical novel \"Tittivulus\".\n\n"}

They play their home games at the Amarillo Civic Center. The Venom began play in 2004 as the Amarillo Dusters, a charter member of the Intense Football League, a small indoor football league based in Texas. They won the championship in their first and only season with the Intense Football League. \n\nThe following year, the Dusters became the first team to leave the Intense Football League and join the AF2, the minor league of the Arena Football League, where they played for four seasons until the AF2's folding in 2009. At that point, the team held a fan vote as to whether to join some of their AF2 brethren in the new Arena Football 1 (now doing business as the Arena Football League) or enjoy numerous Texas rivalries in the Indoor Football League. \n\nIn 2009, it was announced that the Dusters would be moving to the Indoor Football League for the 2010 season. It was then announced that the Dusters would have to be renamed because the Arena Football League owned the rights to the Dusters name and logo. The new Amarillo Venom name and logo was later unveiled. \n\nThe team was featured on an episode of \"Only in America\", a show that aired on the Discovery Times channel.\n\nThe Amarillo Dusters finished their only season in the Intense Football League with a 13–3 record en route to a league championship. Coach Don Carthel lead the Dusters to the cup as they defeated the Lubbock Lone Stars. The Dusters would abandon their spot in the IFL to play in the AF2.\n\nIn their first year in the AF2, the Amarillo Dusters reached the playoffs with an 8–8 record, which was good enough for a wildcard. The Dusters, quarterbacked by Julian Reese, came from 21 points down at the start of the fourth quarter to win Round 1 over the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz. The Dusters fell in Round 2 to the eventual-champion Memphis Xplorers\nThe Dusters tried to build on the moderate success they had in 2005. However, in 2006, the team suffered many injuries and failed to make it to the AF2 playoffs. Quarterback Steve Panella was injured early in the season, forcing numerous backups to take the job. They ended the season with a 4–12 record. Carthel left to take the head coaching job at West Texas A&M two games into the Dusters first AF2 season.\n\nFor 2007, Steve Perdue took over the head coaching job and lead the team playoffs and a first round victory over the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgs. Looking to rebound after the previous losing season, injuries plagued the Dusters' offense. After a win against the Lubbock Renegades the Dusters struggled for the remainder of the year but were still able end the Quincy Carter-led Bossier-Shreveport Battle Wings' perfect season with a 51–49 upset.\n\nOn July 5, 2008, Dusters running back Donte Newsome was shot to death outside of a nightclub in Huntington, West Virginia, home of his alma mater Marshall University.\n\nIn 2008, under the leadership of head coach Chris MacKeown and quarterback Julian Reese, the Amarillo Dusters went 10–9 and played for the AF2 National Conference ArenaCup Finals. Following the Dusters most successful season in their AF2 history, MacKeown moved up to the Arena Football League as the offensive coordinator for John Elway's Colorado Crush.\n\nOn December 21, 2008, the Dusters introduced a new color scheme for the team with crimson, grey, and black.\nẼ\n\nWith the AF2 breaking up and its larger market teams moving to the newly reformed Arena Football League, the Dusters were forced to find a new league. On October 9, 2009, it was announced that, because of a 65–35 percent margin in the fan vote, the Dusters would be moving to the Indoor Football League for the 2010 season. Owner Randy Sanders applied for his team's spot in the Indoor Football League (IFL) and they were accepted as an expansion franchise. It was announced on January 28, 2010, that the Dusters would have to be renamed, because the Arena Football League owned the rights to the Dusters' name and logo. On February 8, the new Amarillo Venom name and logo was unveiled.\n\nFor the 2012 season, the Venom played in the Lone Star Football League (LSFL).

In 2007, the Battle Wings clinched their first-ever playoff berth, beating the Arkansas Twisters and Rio Grande Valley Dorados before being beaten by the eventual Arena Cup champion Tulsa Talons.

They were a 2002 expansion member of the AF2 and played their home games at Rabobank Arena.\n\nIn 2001, the original Blitz was owned by Casey Wasserman, owner of the Arena Football League (AFL) team the Los Angeles Avengers. He owned and managed the team for two seasons. During their Inaugural season the team captured a Western Division title and a playoff berth. The head coach for the team was announced on December 7, 2001. Head coach James Fuller originally came out of Portland State into the NFL where he played for the 1992–1994 San Diego Chargers and the Philadelphia Eagles in 1996–97 as a defensive back. He was head coach of the Bakersfield Blitz during their 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons. He went on from his time with the Blitz to become the head coach for the AFL team Philadelphia Soul owned by Jon Bon Jovi.\n\nIn 2004, the team was sold to an investment group that moved the team to Fresno to become the Central Valley Coyotes, while a new Bakersfield Blitz was formed. In 2005, the AF2 owned the team, and was operated by the owner of the Bakersfield Condors.\n\nIn 2006, a combination of local Bakersfield and professional sports investors bought the franchise from the AF2. However, the Blitz unexpectedly folded after the 2007 season. Although this followed a season in which two players faced rape charges, it is unclear what role, if any, this played in the Blitz's folding.\n\nIn December 2001, a new AF2 franchise was established in Bakersfield. Owner Casey Wasserman (owner of the LA Avengers) hired Brad Hoffman as the first Bakersfield Blitz General Manager. Hoffman managed the team along with staff members Todd Anderson (Public Relations), Mike Krause (Administration), Joel Hupp (Production) and Margo Ivester (Game Operations). The team's coaching staff was led by: Head Coach James Fuller, Fullback/Linebacker Coach Steven Folmar and Offensive/Defensive Assistant Rick Van Horne.\n\nThe owners at the time the Blitz ceased operations:\nJeff Allen, Scott Atkins, Dr. Vip Dev, William Edwards, Scott Erwin, Dr. Todd Farrer, Scott Garrison, Scotty Gelt, Scott Hacker, Clayton Koerner, Paul Press, Fred Prince, Joel Shaddy, Andrew Watkins, and SportsGelt Partners among others.\n\nGeneral Manager Brad Hoffman along with his staff came up with the idea of creating an arena style high school All-Star game to help promote arena football in Kern County. Hoffman's brainchild was the first arena style all-star game in the nation and continues to be the only arena style all-star game in the United States. Although the Blitz franchise changed ownership several times the huge interest in this unique game has kept it alive, even after the Blitz franchise folded in August 2007. It is now known as the \"Bakersfield Arena Bowl.\" It is played every Spring...usually in April.\n\nSeveral of today's NFL Stars and Stars of the Future have played in the game. Most notably is Philadelphia Eagles RB #24 Ryan Mathews who still holds records for scoring in the game. Others who have played is Oakland Raiders QB Derek Carr (brother of David Carr) and USC QB Cody Kessler.\n\nOn July 19, 2003 Blitz reported the untimely death of Bakersfield Blitz Fullback/Linebacker Julian Yearwood. Yearwood, 31, who collapsed on the team bench during the Saturday game against the Wichita Stealth at Kansas Coliseum in Wichita, Kansas. Emergency medical personnel worked on resuscitating Yearwood for over 20 minutes before he was taken off the field on a stretcher.\n\nHe was transported by ambulance to Via Christi St. Francis Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 9:37 p.m. CT on July 19, 2003. His body was transported to the Sedgwick County Coroner's office to have an autopsy performed to determine the cause of death.\n\nThe passing of Yearwood rocked the AF2 family. The game was tied 7-7 in the first quarter when Yearwood came out of the game after blocking a field goal allegedly claiming that he was not well. He collapsed on the field shortly thereafter.\n\nThe league declined to comment on the cause of death, pending an official autopsy, though some reports in the local media indicated it may be heart related.\n\n\nWhile in Boise, Idaho playing the Boise Burn, two members were arrested and charged with crimes related to the July 8, 2007 rape of a young woman in a hotel room in Boise. The players arrested were Maurice Ronald Troutman, 25 and Rennard Reynolds, 30 both of Long Beach, California. Boise police arrested Troutman on July 8, for the alleged rape and Reynolds on July 9, for an alleged burglary connected to the alleged rape. The Blitz team cooperated with Boise police and delayed leaving Boise until the investigation was completed.\n\nMaurice Troutman's rape case was overturned by the Supreme Court. Documents show he never wanted to or tried to take advantage of the woman. Court documents also show she never was tested to see if she had taken Ambien and Alcohol. In Idaho it is illegal to engage in sexual intercourse with someone under the influence of alcohol, drugs etc., because they cannot give consent while having these things in their system; which was why he was charged in the first place.\n\n"}

They played in the Arena Football League (AFL). Their home arena was the Alamodome, following their relocation to San Antonio for the 2012 season.\n\nThe team was founded in 2000 as the Tulsa Talons of Tulsa, Oklahoma, a charter member of the AFL's defunct developmental league, af2. The Talons played in the af2 for ten seasons, and joined the Arena Football League in 2010 following its reorganization. After the 2011 season the team announced they would relocate to San Antonio. The Talons have won ArenaCup championships in 2003 and 2007, won eight af2 division championships, one AFL division championship, and made a total of eleven playoff appearances.\n\nThe Talons began in 2000 in Tulsa, Oklahoma as the Tulsa Talons, a charter member of the now-defunct minor league of Arena football Arena Football 2, also known as af2. In 2009 the Talons moved from their original home field at Tulsa Convention Center to the new 18,041 seat arena called the BOK Center.\n\nIn terms of victories and championships, the Talons were a successful af2 franchise. The Talons had more wins than any other team in af2 history. The Talons were the first af2 franchise to reach 100 overall franchise victories. During the existence of the league, the Talons did not have a losing season and appeared in all ten af2 playoffs. Also, the Tulsa Talons won two af2 championships, known as the ArenaCup, in the last eight years of the league. The Talons are also the team with the longest streak of consecutive seasons in the AFL system.\n\nFormer Head Coach Mitch Allner is the only person in af2 history to win a championship as both player and head coach. In 2004 the Talons were sold to a group led by Henry Primeaux, the owners of automobile dealerships in Oklahoma, and Paul Ross, an investor. In 2009 three new owners were added to the group.\n\nIn 2010, some af2 teams joined with a handful of AFL teams which had remained in operation after the cancellation of the 2009 season formed a new league that was to be named AF1. The Talons moved from the af2 and joined the league, which became the highest level of indoor American football. However, the league soon decided to use the former Arena Football League name rather than AF1.\n\nOn September 21, 2011, Talons chairman Paul Ross announced the team was moving to San Antonio due to less than desirable attendance and ticket sales. The team was purchased by a group led by California businessman Jason Lohe and the Talons were introduced to the city of San Antonio on September 27, 2011. Despite AFL tradition to adopt previous AFL team names and identities for new teams in previous markets, the Talons chose to keep their nickname and not adopt the identity of the long-defunct San Antonio Force, due in part to the preexistence of the Georgia Force (a similar issue forced the Pittsburgh Power to adopt its current name instead of the Gladiators). In March 2012, Lynd Sports LLC, became a partial owner of the Talons. Just days later, Lohe was forced to return to California with family issues, and David Lynd became the principal owner of the franchise. The Talons then made a big play in free agency by signing veteran quarterback Aaron Garcia, who was fresh off of leading the Jacksonville Sharks to their first ever ArenaBowl victory.\n\nIn December 2013, Lynd was sued for breach of contract when his real estate company (Lynd Company) failed to follow through on a $1.7 million purchase.

{"id": "1956649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956649", "title": "Cirebonese people", "text": "Cirebonese people\n\nThe Cirebonese or Cirebonese people are an Austronesian ethnic group and nation native on the city of Cirebon and its immediate surrounding area, located in the northern part of the island of Java in Indonesia. Numbering approximately 1.9 million, the Cirebonese are mostly Muslim. Their language, Cirebonese, is a mixture of Javanese and Sundanese, with a heavier influence from Javanese, and as such is variably classified as either a dialect of both of those languages or as an independent language.\n\nAt first, the existence of the Cirebonese ethnic group of people have always been associated with the presence of Sundanese and Javanese people. However, its presence later led to the formation of its own culture, ranging from a variety of coastal batik that does not really follow the standards of the Javanese palace style or commonly known as interior batik, until the emergence of traditional Islamic patterns that came about in accordance with the construction of the Cirebon palace in the 15th century, which was fully based on Islam. The existence of the Cirebonese ethnic group that does not consider themselves as Sundanese or Javanese people was finally answered in the 2010 population census whereby a column that specifically mentions Cirebonese was made available. This meant that the existence of Cirebonese ethnic group has been recognized nationally as a separate tribe, according to Erna Tresna Prihatin:-\n\nIn the past, Cirebonese was used in coastal trade in West Java from Cirebon which was one of the major ports, particularly in the 15th century until the 17th century. The is influenced by Sundanese culture since the Cirebonese are located adjacent to the Sundanese cultural region; especially Kuningan and Majalengka, and also influenced by Chinese, Arab and European culture. This is evident in words such as \"\"Taocang\"\" (pigtail) which is a loanword from Chinese language (Hokkien language), the word \"\"Bakda\"\" (after) which is from Arabic language, and then the word \"\"Sonder\"\" (without) which is the absorption of European languages (Dutch language). The Cirebonese language also maintains ancient forms of the Javanese language such as phrases and pronunciation, for example \"\"Ingsun\"\" (I) and \"\"Sira\"\" (you) are words that are no longer used by the Baku Javanese language.\n\nThe question about Cirebonese as an independent language from the Sundanese and Javanese language has been a fairly long debate, and has involved political government, cultural and linguistic factors.\n\nStudies made by using questionnaires as a benchmark to indicate vocabulary and basic culture (eating, drinking, and so on) based on Guiter's method showed differences in Cirebonese vocabulary with Javanese in Central Java and Yogyakarta was up to 75 percent, while differences with the Javanese language dialect in East Java was up to 76 percent.\n\nAlthough linguistic research to date suggests that Cirebonese is \"only\" a dialect (for according to Guiter's observation, it is said that to be a separate language it must have as much as 80% differences from its closest language), but to date the 5th Regional Regulation of West Java Provincial, 2003 still recognizes Cirebonese as a language of its own and not a dialect. According to the Head of Language Bandung, Muh. Abdul Khak, it is legitimate because the regulation is based on political assessment. In the world of language according to him, a language can be recognized on the basis of three things. First, on the basis of the recognition by its speakers, second on the basis of the political, and the third on the basis of linguistics. Language on the basis of political, other examples can be seen from the history of Indonesian language. Indonesian language which stems out from the Malay language, should be named Indonesian dialect of the Malay language. However, on the basis of political interests, eventually development of the Malay language in the country of Indonesia by the Indonesian government that it was claimed and named as Indonesian language. In addition to political reasons, the recognition of Cirebonese as a language can also be viewed from within its geographical borders. Abdul Khak mentioned that Cirebonese is regarded as a dialect if viewed nationally with the involvement of Javanese language. Which means, when regulations was first made only within the area of West Java, Cirebonese was not regarded as significant in comparison to the Javanese language. What more if compared with Betawi Malay and Sundanese, Cirebonese is indeed different.\n\nWith the revised legislation it has actually allowed various linguistic arguments. However, a greater interest of which is considered from the political standpoint are the Cirebonese speakers, who do not want to be regarded as Javanese or Sundanese people. Chairman of the Institute of Cirebonese Language and Literature, Nurdin M. Noer said that Cirebonese is a mixture of Javanese and Sundanese. Although in conversations, Cirebonese people can still understand some of the Javanese language, he said Cirebonese vocabulary continues to develop and does not only \"depend\" on the vocabulary of the Javanese nor the Sundanese language. He mentioned:\n\nIf revision were to be made on the regulations mentioned, there will most likely be a protest from the speakers of the Cirebonese community. Linguistic expert, Chaedar Al Wasilah assessed that with the native speakers being more vocal, changes to the recognition should not be done. Therefore, what is needed is to protect the Cirebonese language from extinction.\n\nMost of the original vocabularies of this language have nothing in common with the standard Javanese language (Surakarta-Yogyakarta region) neither morphology nor phonetics. Indeed, the Cirebonese language used in Cirebon and with those in Indramayu, although are part of the Javanese language; have huge differences with the \"standard Javanese language\", which is the language taught in schools that held to the Solo Javanese language. Thus, before the 1970s, textbooks from Solo can no longer be used because it was too difficult for students (and perhaps also, the teacher). Therefore, in the 1970s, textbooks were replaced with Sundanese textbooks which are considered to be easier to understand because speakers of Sundanese language are \"closer\". However, it turns out that the idea was a misconception (of the Cirebonese language) until movement was emerged to replace the textbook in the language used in the region, namely Cirebonese dialect of the Javanese language. Nevertheless, publishers that supported of regional language to be taught in schools did not include the word \"Javanese language of the Cirebonese dialect\" again in the following year, but instead used the term \"Cirebonese language\". It has also been done on published books by supporters of Cirebonese as a teaching subject in 2001 and 2002. \n\"Cirebonese Language Dictionary\" written by Sudjana had not put words \"Javanese language of Cirebonese dialect\" but only \"Cirebonese Language Dictionary\". So it was with the publishing of \"Wyakarana - Cirebonese Grammar\" in 2002 which no longer shows the existence of Cirebonese as part of the Javanese language, but instead as an independent language itself.\n\nFollowing is a comparison between Cirebonese with other languages that are considered cognate, such as Serang Javanese (Bantenese), Tegal and Pemalangan dialect of the Javanese, as well as Baku Javanese (Surakarta-Yogyakarta dialect) of the Bagongan (vernacular) style.\nAccording to Mr. Nurdin M. Noer, chairman of the Institute of Cirebonese Language and Literature there are at least a few Cirebonese dialects, some which are Cirebonese Dermayon dialect or also known as Indramayuan dialect, Cirebonese Jawareh dialect (Sawareh Javanese) or Javanese Separuh dialect, Cirebonese Plered dialect and Gegesik dialect (northern region of West Cirebon; today it is divided into Kedawung and Tengah Tani districts).\n\nThe Jawareh dialect or also referred to as Sawareh (meaning \"partial\", or literally \"half\") Javanese is a dialect of the Cirebonese language that is used around the borders of Cirebon Regency and Brebes Regency, or around the borders of Majalengka Regency and Kuningan Regency. The Jawareh dialect is a combination of part Javanese language and part Sundanese language.\n\nThe Cirebonese Dermayon dialect is widely used in the area of Indramayu Regency, according to the Guiter's method, the Dermayon dialect have about 30% differences with the Cirebonese language itself. The main characteristic of Dermayon dialect speakers is to use the word \"\"Reang\"\" as a term for the word \"I\" instead of using the word \"\"Isun\"\" as those used by Cirebonese language speakers.\n\nThe Cirebonese Plered dialect that is used in the west side of Cirebon Regency, is known its strong use of \"O\" characteristic. For example, in standard Cirebonese language the word \"\"Sira\"\" in western Cirebon Regency dialect is translated as \"\"Siro\"\", which means \"You\". The word \"\"Apa\"\" in Cirebonese language becomes \"\"Apo\"\" (means, \"What\") in western Cirebonese dialect, likewise the word \"\"Jendela\"\" becomes \"\"Jendelo\"\" (means, \"Window\"). For instance, \"\"anak saya masuk teka\"\" will be translated as \"\"anak kita manjing ning teko\"\". Besides that Cirebonese Plered dialect has its own unique accent such as the usage of additional words like \"\"jeh\"\" or \"\"tah\"\" in any conversation. Dialect speakers who occupies the western region of Cirebon Regency tend to express themselves with the title \"\"Wong Cirebon\"\", which is very much different from the standard Cirebonese language (Sira) used by the residents of Cirebon city to refer to themselves as \"\"Tiyang Grage\"\"; although both \"\"Wong Cirebon\"\" and \"\"Tiyang Grage\"\" have the same meaning that is \"Cirebonese\".\n\nGegesik is a dialect that is spoken in the northern region of West Cirebon and around Gegesik district, the Cirebonese Gegesik dialect is often used as the intermediary language in Pewayangan from Cirebon by the Dalang (puppet master) himself and there is a possibility that this is a finer dialect compared to the dialect of the \"\"Wong Cirebon\"\" itself.\n\nBelow are the terms used by Cirebonese people to address family members:\n\nThe Royal Wedding custom of the Cirebonese community is called \"Pelakrama Ageng\" in Cirebonese language. The customs of marriage attempts to elevate local traditions with the emphasis on Islam as the center of the ceremony. The customs of Cirebonese wedding has its own local moral values in the context of the simplicity in the Cirebonese community way of carrying out large celebrations. Such example is in the Cirebonese dowry customs which only requires tubers, vegetables and valuables (as in the form of jewelry or cash according to the groom's means), where in carrying out those requirements Cirebonese community will prioritize Islamic elements more than others; and among them is to avoid \"ria\" (the attitude of wanting to be praised).\n\nA marriage proposal or in Cirebonese language \"tetali\" or \"njegog\" is the early stage of the Cirebonese Royal Wedding procession whereby the messenger of the man visits the parents of the woman's house and expressed his intention to marry their daughter. Then the woman's mother would ask her for her approval. The woman will then give her answer in the presence of the messenger as a witness. After receiving the answer, the messenger and the woman's parents will have a discussion to determine the wedding date. Once there is agreement, the messenger excuse himself to convey the message to the man's parents.\n\nOn the day of delivering the dowries, the woman's parents accompanied her immediate family members will receive the man's messenger as he arrives together with his envoy accompanied a group men carrying the dowry; among them are:-\n\nAccording to Sultan Sepuh XIV Pangeran Raja Adipati Arief Natadiningrat, \"Siraman\" (meaning, \"splashing of water\" or \"washing\" and sometimes also referred to as \"Siram Tawandari\") symbolizes purity. The \"Siraman\" procession is a tradition of bathing the bride with a certain traditional procedure takes place before proceeding with the solemnization ceremony. It aims to cleanse the body and soul of the bride before conducting the ceremony, which is the door to starting a new life with her partner.\n\nBoth the bride and groom will be brought to the place for \"Siraman\", called \"cungkup\" by the makeup person, accompanied by their parents and elders. As they walk towards the place for \"Siraman\" accompanied with traditional musical instruments; the \"nablong\", the bride will wear a batik sarong of Cirebonese style, namely the \"Wadasan\" cloth. Usually the color of the sarong is green which symbolizes fertility. Before \"Siraman\", the chest and back of the bride will be given scrubs and after which the makeup person will then invite the parents and elders to wash the bride alternately. Once completed, the water that is used to wash the bride will be given to young girls and boys who were present as a symbolic meaning that they should follow the examples of the bride and groom. This ceremony is called \"Bendrong Sirat\" where the water used for the \"Siraman\" are sprinkled to the young girls and boys who attended the event.\n\nTo ornate or in Cirebonese language called \"Parasan\" is done by the prospective bride after the \"Siraman\" ceremony. One of the \"Parasan\" process called \"ngerik\" where the removal of fine hair done by the makeup person as the parents and relatives watch. This event accompanied by \"moblong\", a \"karawitan\" music which means the fountain of water is like a full moon.\n\nVisiting of tomb (\"ziarah\") is normally done to offer prayers for ancestors who have already gone. Usually if the bride is a descendant of the Cirebonese Sultanate, the bride will make a visit to the tomb of Sunan Gunung Jati tomb and the ancestral tomb of the Cirebonese sultans at the Astana Gunung Jati Tomb of the Cirebonese Kings Complex in Astana village, Gunung Jati district, Cirebon Regency to receive blessings before proceeding with the marriage ceremony.\n\nVisitation of the Astana Gunung Jati Tomb of the Cirebonese Kings Complex begins by praying in front of the \"pasujudan\" gate. The door is the third of the nine doors leading to the tomb of Sunan Gunung Jati that seats at the top of the hill. Apart from praying in front of the \"pasujudan\" door, usually Sultan Sepuh of the Kasepuhan palace and the bride will also spread flower petals and offer prayer in the tombs of the elders of Kasepuhan palace; and among them are Sultan Sepuh Raja Sulaiman and Sultan Sepuh PRA Maulana Pakuningrat. The visitation ends at the time for Salat Zuhr prayer.\n\nWhen the wedding day arrives as agreed, representatives of the bride will send emissaries to fetch the groom. Once arrive at the home of the groom's family and the messenger delivers his message with the intention to bring the prospective groom to the bride's home for a wedding ceremony. Parents of the groom are not allowed participate in the marriage ceremony as it is forbidden for them to witness.\n\nOnce the consent has been granted by the parents of the bride (\"Ijab Kabul\"), the groom will be covered with a cloth belonging to the bride's mother. This signifies that the groom has become a son-in-law. After it has been done, the cloth will be taken back to indicate that the bride is no longer in the protection of her parents and now has to carry her own responsibility. \"Ijab Kabul\" in Royal Wedding or \"Pelakrama Ageng\" of the Cirebonese palace is usually conveyed in loosed Cirebonese language.\n\nOnce the solemnization ceremony is completed, they will proceed with the meeting of the bride and the bridegroom ceremony which is referred to as \"Temon\" or \"Salam Temon\". Both the bride and the bridegroom will be brought to the front porch or doorway of the house for a stepping on eggs event. The egg made up of shell, egg white and egg yolk bears its own symbolic meaning:-\n\nThis event is held as a form of parents expressing their happiness for the marriage of their children. Coins that are mixed with yellow rice and turmeric are spread, or in Cirebonese language it is called \"Sawer\", as a sign so that the bride and groom are given an abundance of fortune, attain mutual respect, live in harmony and are well-suited for each other. Normally when coins are sprinkled or spread, noises of excitement are heard of those that were rushing for the money, yellow rice and turmeric. Those noise of excitement is what is referred to as \"Surak\".\n\nIn a squatting position, the head of the bride and bridegroom are sprinkled with \"pugpugan\" by the makeup person. The \"pugpugan\" is made of \"welit\"; which is either ilalang or fermented coconut leaves. The purpose of this ceremony is done for a long lasting marriage just as the \"welit\" are tied tightly until it is fermented, and for both of the bride and bridegroom to be able to make a full use of the sustenance that they are blessed with. Once the ceremony is completed by the makeup person, the bride and bridegroom are bought into the aisle. Parents of the bridegroom are then invited by relatives of the bride to accompany the bride and bridegroom in the aisle.\n\nPartaking of the \"nasi ketan kuning\" (yellow sticky rice) by the bride and bridegroom ceremony is led by the makeup person. The \"nasi ketan kuning\" is arranged in a circle of 13 grains of rice. First, the parents of the bride feeds the bride and bridegroom with a total of 4 grains. Then, another 4 grains are fed to the bride and bridegroom by the parents of the bridegroom. Followed by the bride and bridegroom feeding each other with total of 2 grains. The remaining 1 grain of rice is to be contested and it symbolizes whomever manages to get the last grain of rice will be blessed abundantly.\n\nHowever, the last grain of rice is not to be consumed but to be given to his or her spouse. During the event, both of the bride and bridegroom are seated in front as a symbol of a united husband and wife in building a happy family. Apart from that, this event; which is also called \"adep-adep sekul\", bears the meaning of harmony in the family among the couple, parents and parents-in-law.\n\nBoth of the bride and bridegroom pays homage to their parents by kneeling as a reflection of their respect and gratitude to their parents for all the love and guidance that has been devoted to them. The bride and groom also ask for blessings to build their own household with their spouse. After this ceremony, a love song with advise in a form of \"macapat\" is played with the hope the bride and bridegroom are able to manage their household in agreement, in life and in death with one another.\n\nAfter receiving the blessings of their parents, the bride and bridegroom are then congratulated by relatives that are present. Usually, entertainment such as dancing are held. For example, Cirebon mask dance, Cirebonese cultural dance and Tayub dance.\n\nIn relations with Sundanese people or culture, the existence of the Cirebonese people is marked in a form of the existence of the Cirebon palace; where the founders of the Cirebon palace namely Raden Walangsungsang, Nyai Rara Santang and Prince Surya are the \"Kuwu\" (Cirebonese term of head of settlement) in Kaliwedi district are the descendants of the Pajajaran kingdom of the Kingdom of Sunda. However in the subsequent development of the Cirebon palace; which is the symbol of existence of Cirebonese people, chose its own path which is mostly patterned after Islam.\n\nIn relation to Javanese culture, the existence of Cirebonese language has always been associated with the Javanese language due to the Cirebonese grammar that is similar to the Javanese grammar, as well as the existence of several words in the Cirebonese language also shares the same meaning in Javanese language.\n\nFor example \"\"Isun arep lunga sing umah\"\" in Cirebonese language means \"I want to leave from home\" where if translated in Javanese language it is \"\"I arep lungo sing umah\"\". Words obtained in both translations are almost similar but the variety of sentences in Cirebonese language is not limited to only from the absorption of Javanese language. An example of a variant dialect in Cirebonese language, \"\"ari khaul mulae bakda magrib mah punten, isun beli bisa teka, ana janji sih karo adhine\"\". The word \"\"ari\"\" that is found in the sentence is an uptake of the Sundanese language and the word \"\"bakda\"\" is an absorption of the Arabic language. Where if translated into standard Sundanese language or standard Javanese language, a different variety of vocabulary will be found from the Cirebonese sentences.\n\n\n\n"}

Each bud has the potential to form shoots, and may be specialized in producing either vegetative shoots (stems and branches) or reproductive shoots (flowers). Once formed, a bud may remain dormant for some time, or it may form a shoot immediately.\n\nAn axillary bud is an embryonic or organogenic shoot which lies dormant at the junction of the stem and petiole of a plant. It arises exogenously from outer layer of cortex of the stem.\n\nAxillary buds do not become actively growing shoots on plants with strong apical dominance (the tendency to grow just the terminal bud on the main stem). Apical dominance occurs because the shoot apical meristem produces auxin which prevents axillary buds from growing. The axillary buds begin developing when they are exposed to less auxin, for example if the plant naturally has weak apical dominance, if apical dominance is broken by removing the terminal bud, or if the terminal bud has grown far enough away for the auxin to have less of an effect.\n\nAxillary buds can be used to differentiate if the plant is single-leafed or multi-leafed. Simply count the number of leaves after an axillary bud. If there is only one leaf, then the plant is considered single-leafed, if not it is considered multi-leafed. An example of axillary buds are the eyes of the potato. \n\nAs the apical meristem grows and forms leaves, it leaves behind a region of meristematic cells at the node between the stem and the leaf. These axillary buds are usually dormant, inhibited by auxin produced by the apical meristem, which is known as apical dominance.\n\nIf the apical meristem is removed, or has grown a sufficient distance away from an axillary bud, the axillary bud may become activated (or more appropriately freed from hormone inhibition). Like the apical meristem, axillary buds can develop into a stem or flower.\n\nCertain plant diseases - notably phytoplasmas - can cause the proliferation of axillary buds, and cause plants to become bushy in appearance.\n"}

Phenazone is synthesized by condensation of phenylhydrazine and ethyl acetoacetate under basic conditions and methylation of the resulting intermediate compound 1-phenyl-3-methylpyrazolone with dimethyl sulfate or methyl iodide.

{"id": "1956655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956655", "title": "Wes Hall", "text": "Wes Hall\n\nSir Wesley Winfield Hall (born 12 September 1937) is a Barbadian former cricketer and politician. A tall, strong and powerfully built man, Hall was a genuine fast bowler and despite his very long run up, he was renowned for his ability to bowl long spells. Hall played 48 Test matches for the West Indies from 1958 to 1969. Hall's opening bowling partnership with fellow Barbadian Charlie Griffith was a feature of the strong West Indies teams throughout the 1960s. Hall was one of the most popular cricketers of his day and was especially popular in Australia, where he played two seasons in the Sheffield Shield with Queensland.\n\nA wicket-keeper/batsman as a schoolboy, Hall did not take up fast bowling until relatively late. He was included in the West Indies squad to tour England in 1957 having only played one match of first-class cricket. He made his Test cricket debut against India in 1958 and was instantly successful. He took a Test hat-trick in Pakistan in 1959, the first West Indian cricketer to do so. Hall bowled the final over in two famous Test matches, the Tied Test against Australia in 1960 and the Lord's Test against England in 1963. Years of non-stop cricket and resultant injury reduced Hall's effectiveness in the latter part of his Test career.\n\nAfter his playing days Hall entered Barbadian politics, serving in both the Barbados Senate and House of Assembly and appointed Minister of Tourism in 1987. He was also involved in the administration of West Indies cricket as a selector and team manager and served as President of the West Indies Cricket Board from 2001 to 2003. Hall was later ordained a minister in the Christian Pentecostal Church. He is a member of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame and the West Indies Cricket Hall of Fame. In 2012 he was created a Knight Bachelor for services to sport and the community.\n\nHall was born in Saint Michael, Barbados—\"just outside the walls of [HM Prison] Glendairy\"—to a teenaged mother, his father a sometime light-heavyweight boxer. Hall began his schooling at St Giles' Boys' School and later obtained a place at the renowned Combermere School thanks to a free scholarship. At Combermere, he played for the school cricket team initially as a wicketkeeper/batsman. At the time the leading schools in Barbados played against grown men in the elite Division 1 of the Barbados Cricket Association and Hall was exposed to a high standard of cricket at an early age. One of his teammates at Combermere was the school groundskeeper, the West Indian Test cricketer Frank King.\n\nAfter completing his schooling, Hall found employment with the cable office in Bridgetown. Hall played for the Cable Office cricket team and it was there that Hall took up fast bowling. In a match against Wanderers, Hall was asked to fill in when his team's regular opening bowler was absent. He took six wickets that day and decided that bowling would be his path to the West Indies team. His talent was soon recognised and in 1956 he was included in the Barbados team to play E. W. Swanton's XI in 1956. Hall, still very young and inexperienced, did not take a wicket in the match, his first-class cricket debut. Hall was unlucky, however, not to pick up a wicket having Colin Cowdrey dropped by Kenneth Branker at first slip. Despite the lack of success Hall did catch the eye of Swanton who marked him down as a bowler of \"great promise\".\n\nBased partly on this promise, Hall was selected in the West Indian squad to tour England in 1957. Despite great enthusiasm, Hall struggled in the unfamiliar surroundings, unable to pitch the ball anywhere near the wicket. Hall remarked later \"When I hit the softer wickets I was like a fish out of water.\" Hall did not play in any of the Test matches and in first-class matches on the tour as a whole took 27 wickets at an average of 33.55. Hall's lack of success in England saw him overlooked for the entire home Test series against Pakistan in 1957–58.\n\nOriginally left out of the West Indies team to tour India and Pakistan in 1958–59, Hall was called into the team as a back up for the Trinidadian Jaswick Taylor after the all-rounder Frank Worrell withdrew from the team at a late stage. Hall met with some success an early match against Baroda, taking 5 wickets for 41 runs (5/41) in Baroda's second innings. This performance saw Hall overtake Taylor to become the first-choice partner of Roy Gilchrist in the Test team. The pair had a highly successful Test series against the Indians with \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" describing the duo as \"two fearsome opening bowlers reminiscent of the days of [Manny] Martindale and [Learie] Constantine.\"\n\nHall made his debut in the first Test against India at Brabourne Stadium at Bombay and met with almost instant success. He dismissed the Indian opener Nari Contractor for a duck and quickly followed than with the wickets of Pankaj Roy and Vijay Manjrekar. In what ended as a dour draw, Hall finished with 3/35 in the first innings and 1/72 in the second. When Gilchrist was dropped from the second Test at Modi Stadium in Kanpur, Hall—in only his second Test match—was given the responsibility of leading the West Indies bowling attack. Hall was equal to the task, playing \"a decisive part in India's downfall\" taking 11 wickets in the match. Over the entire five Test series—won by the West Indies three Tests to nil—Hall and Gilchrist terrorised the Indian batsman, who had neither the \"experience or the physical capacity\" to stand up to the West Indian fast bowling duo.\n\nThe West Indies were not as successful in the three Test series against Pakistan, losing the first two Tests before winning the final Test—the first time Pakistan had lost a Test match at home. Hall bowled well in both the matches, however. In the second Test at Dacca, Hall relied on movement through the air rather than sheer pace and had Pakistan reeling on stage, five wickets down for only 22 runs made (22–5) In the third Test at Bagh-e-Jinnah in Lahore, Hall made history by becoming the first West Indian to take a hat-trick in Test cricket. His victims were Mushtaq Mohammad (aged 15 and in his debut Test match, at the time the youngest cricketer to play Test cricket), Nasim-ul-Ghani and Fazal Mahmood.\n\nHall once again performed well when England toured the West Indies in 1959–60. \"Wisden\" remarked that Hall \"with a lovely action, genuine speed and remarkable stamina\" was \"always the biggest threat to England.\" Hall came close to winning the third Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica for the West Indies on the first day when England were reduced to 165/5 at stumps, Hall having captured five of the wickets to fall. Only Colin Cowdrey was able to stand in his way with Hall finishing the innings with 7/69, his best bowling figures in Test cricket. In the third Test in a placid pitch at Bourda in British Guiana, Hall again broke the back of England's batting taking six wickets for 90 runs in the England first innings. This included bowling M. J. K. Smith out for a duck for the second Test in a row. Hall played alongside his great partner Charlie Griffith in Test cricket for the first time in the fifth Test at Port of Spain. By this stage, Hall had \"burned himself out\" and he bowled only four overs in the England second innings as the West Indies pushed for a series-equalling win. Unfortunately for the West Indies and Hall, England held on for a draw and won the series one Test to nil.\n\nIn April 1960, Hall began the first of his three seasons as a professional with Accrington Cricket Club in the Lancashire League. Hall was first offered a contract by Accrington for the 1959 season, which he turned down through loyalty to his employer in Barbados who had provided him with leave to tour England. Hall was a success in League cricket, capturing 100 wickets in the 1960 season, 106 wickets in the 1961 season (when Accrington won the Lancashire League championship) and 123 wickets in the 1962 season, falling just short of the then-League record. Hall also managed to capture 10 wickets in an innings on two occasions with Accrington, 10/57 against Burnley and 10/28 against Bacup. Hall left Accrington in 1964 to take up a less restrictive contract with Great Chell Cricket Club in the Staffordshire League. During the 1964 season, Hall married his childhood sweetheart Shurla in Liverpool.\n\nThe 1960–61 Test series against Australia is one of the most famous in the history of Test cricket and Hall played a major role in its outcome. The first Test in the series at the Gabba in Brisbane had a thrilling finish. The West Indies set Australia a target of 233 runs to win the match. Hall broke through early, taking the wickets of Bob Simpson and Neil Harvey, followed, after some stubborn resistance, by Norm O'Neill. The West Indies captain Frank Worrell then dismissed Colin McDonald before Hall struck again for his fourth wicket, Les Favell caught by Joe Solomon. Australia were 57/5 and the West Indies seemed set to win the match. After the sixth Australian wicket fell with Australia having made only 92 runs, the Australian captain Richie Benaud came to the crease to join Alan Davidson. Together the pair took Australia to 226/7 and now Australia looked assured victors with only 7 runs to get. Joe Solomon then turned the game again with a direct hit on the stumps to run out Davidson. Hall was entrusted by his captain Worrell to bowl the last over of the day with Australia needing four runs and West Indies needing three wickets to win the game. In one of the most exciting finishes in Test match history, Hall had Benaud caught behind, then dropped a catch and two Australian batsmen were run out trying to make the winning run. The match finished in a tie, the first in Test cricket.\n\nHall bowled well in the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, taking 4/51 in the first innings and another two wickets \"bowling at his fastest\" in the second innings in which Australia comfortably made the 70 runs they needed to win the Test. The pitches used in the remaining three Test of the series favoured slow bowling and Hall did not play as large a role from that point on. West Indies won the third Test, the fourth Test was a thrilling draw but Australia won the final Test, at Melbourne again, to win the series two Tests to one. Over the course of the series both teams had striven to play bright, attractive cricket and the Australian public took the West Indian team to their hearts. Hall and the West Indies were farewelled with a ticker-tape parade through the streets of Melbourne. Hundreds of thousands of Australians keen to express their appreciation for the team brought the city to a standstill and reportedly brought Hall and his teammates to tears. Hall later described the spontaneous display of affection from the public as one usually \"reserved for royalty or the Beatles\".\n\nHis popularity in Australia saw Hall invited to play with Queensland for the 1961–62 Sheffield Shield season. Hall enjoyed an immensely successful season with Queensland and a key part of the team's second place in the Sheffield Shield competition—behind perennial powerhouse New South Wales. Hall took 43 wickets for the season at an average of 20.25, trailing only Richie Benaud of New South Wales in the season aggregate. Hall's 43 wickets set a new record for a Queensland bowler in a first-class cricket season. Hall returned for a second season with Queensland in 1962–63, taking 33 wickets for the season as Queensland again finished runner-up in the Sheffield Shield, this time to Victoria. Towards the end of Hall's second season, it became clear that the demands of playing cricket 12 months of the year were starting to take a toll on Hall. Queensland were keen to see Hall return for another season in 1963–64 but Hall declined, fearing his body would not stand up to the strain.\n\nAfter his first season with Queensland, Hall returned to the Caribbean to join the West Indies team in their Test series against India in 1962. Hall took up where he left off against the Indians two years before. The Indians were a better batting side than the one Hall destroyed in the sub-continent in 1960 but they were still unable to come to terms with his pace. The West Indies won the series 5 Tests to nil and Hall took 27 wickets at an average of 15.74. When the second Test at Sabina Park was heading towards what looked to be a tame draw on a placid pitch, Hall broke the game wide open with some \"grand bowling\", taking 6/49 and West Indies won the match by an innings. In the fourth Test at Queens Park Oval, Hall was part of a 93-run partnership for the last wicket, making 50 runs himself. He then scythed through the Indian top order, taking the first five wickets of the innings to have India at 30/5 at one stage, a position they could not recover from.\n\nThe success of Hall and his fast bowling partner Griffith saw the arrival of the West Indies pace duo in England for the 1963 Test series \"greeted with the public awe and press build-up formerly accorded to [the Australians] Ted McDonald and Jack Gregory or Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller.\" Before the tour, Hall and fellow professional cricketers Garry Sobers and Rohan Kanhai threatened to withdraw from the team unless paid the equivalent of their professional earnings they had forsaken. Only the intervention of captain Frank Worrell saw the three join the tour. The West Indies, with their \"sparkling batting, bowling and fielding\", won the series three Tests to one and captured the imagination of the English public. While Hall had a successful series—taking 16 wickets at an average of 33.37—it was Griffith who was the main destroyer for the West Indies. Hall was \"the ideal foil\" for Griffith and played an invaluable support role. As a partnership, Hall and Griffith were \"the centre of attraction and the key to victory\".\n\nAnalysis of film footage at this time showed Hall bowling at 103mph. With Griffiths bowling from the other end batsmen had nowhere to hide.\n\nPerhaps Hall's greatest performance of the English summer was in the second Test at Lord's. On the final day of the Test, Hall bowled unchanged for 200 minutes, broken only by the tea interval. As in the Tied Test in Brisbane three years earlier, Hall found himself bowling the final over of the match with both sides still capable of winning. In the innings as a whole Hall bowled 40 overs for a return of 4/93 but despite Hall's brave efforts, England managed to hold on for a draw—the England batsman Colin Cowdrey returned to the crease with a broken arm to help save the match. \"The Times\" said of Hall that day, \"His energy was astonishing, his stamina inexhaustible, his speed awesome, from the first ball to the last\". Hall himself claimed that it was his \"finest hour\". There was a sour note in the final Test at The Oval when Hall was informally warned about intimidatory bowling. Hall bowled two successive bouncers to the England opening batsman Brian Bolus, prompting umpire Syd Buller to speak with West Indies captain Worrell saying, \"We don't want this sort of bowling to get out of hand otherwise I will have to speak to the bowler.\" Later than innings, Griffith was formally warned by the same umpire.\n\nThe Australian tour of the West Indies in 1964–65 was somewhat overshadowed by concerns about the bowling action of Griffith, whom the visitors considered a \"chucker\". Regardless, Hall again started a Test series strongly. In the first Test at Sabina Park—Hall's favourite hunting ground—Hall took 5/60 in the first innings and then 4/45 in the second to play a leading role in the West Indies victory. \"Wisden \" was of the opinion that Hall \"probably never bowled faster or straighter.\" It was \"the most important single contribution of bowling in the five Tests\" but Hall was not as effective in the remainder of the series, taking only seven wickets in the following four Tests. West Indies held on to win the series two Tests to one—the first time the West Indies defeated Australia in a Test series.\n\nAs a result of their huge support in 1963, the West Indies were invited to tour England again only three years later. Despite the England press and public fearing the impact of Hall and his partner Griffith, it was soon clear that their powers had waned somewhat since 1963. Hall's \"action was as poetic as ever and his commitment was just as great, but something was missing.\" He captured 18 wickets in the five Tests at an average of 30.83. However, Hall was still considered \"the key man of the [West Indies] attack\" and on occasion was still as damaging as ever. His finest moment of the series was in the fourth Test at Headingley where a \"spell of eighty minutes by Hall at his fastest and best destroyed England\" aiding his team to win the match by an innings and 55 runs and wrap up the series and the Wisden Trophy.\n\nIn 1966, the Trinidad-based company West Indian Tobacco (WITCO) engaged Hall on a three-year contract to promote youth cricket in Trinidad and Tobago, including playing for the Trinidad and Tobago national team in the Shell Shield, the West Indies first-class cricket championship. One of Hall's first roles for WITCO was to promote the Wes Hall Youth Cricket League, a new nation-wide junior cricket league.\n\nHall accompanied the West Indies cricket team to India and Ceylon in 1966–67 but was a shadow of the bowler that cut a swathe through India in earlier series. He injured his left knee during a net session early in the tour and the sub-continental pitches neutered his speed. Hall started the first Test of the series at Bombay in style, capturing two early wickets in a \"superb\" spell, \"worthy of a great fast bowler\" but did not take another wicket in the match. \"Wisden\" said of Hall's efforts in the series; \"He could not bowl with the sustained hostility of old, and his form was erratic.\"\n\nThe slow decline of Hall as an effective Test match bowler became clearer after the home series against England in 1967–68. Hall \"bowled with his old enthusiasm\" in the second Test at Kingston, albeit on a pitch described by \"Wisden\" as \"crazy paving\" but as the series continued the England batsmen took a heavy toll on Hall and his long-time partner Griffith. Still, such was their prestige and their perceived psychological advantage over the English that the West Indies selectors stuck with the pair for the entire series. In the four Tests he played, Hall took only 9 wickets and those at an average of 39.22. In a summary of the tour \"Wisden\" said \"In the event Hall proved to be little more than a shadow of the great fast bowler he had been. His pace was no longer to be feared ...\"\n\nThe West Indies captain Garry Sobers had to fight with the selectors to have Hall included in the West Indies team to tour Australia and New Zealand in 1968–69. The West Indies Test selection panel told Sobers that Hall was \"past his best\" and that he would be left out of the team. Sobers still considered Hall one of the best bowlers in the Caribbean and insisted on his selection, threatening to withdraw from the tour himself if he did not get his man in the squad. The selectors eventually conceded and Hall was included in the touring party but—according to Sobers—one of the selectors was told to tell Hall he was only picked because of pressure from the captain. As it turned out Hall only played in two of the Tests in Australia with \"Wisden\" noting that \"old age, as cricketers go, had finally had its say\". The once fearsome pair of Hall and Griffith now \"resembled exhausted volcanoes.\" Hall played the first Test against New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland. Hall sustained an injury and was not able to complete the match, having bowled only 16 overs for the match and taking a solitary wicket. Hall was still unfit to play by the time the second Test started and never again played Test cricket.\n\nAfter the New Zealand tour, Hall joined the Barbados team for a short tour of England. Hall played two first-class matches on the tour, capturing two wickets at an average of 53.00. Hall then returned to Trinidad to complete his last season in the Shell Shield and his contract with WITCO. Hall met with moderate success, taking 15 wickets for Trinidad at a respectable average of 22.46. Hall's last first-class match was for Barbados against the touring Indians in 1971.\n\nBefore he left Trinidad in 1970 Hall was asked by Gerard Pantin—a Catholic priest in the Holy Ghost Fathers order— if he would assist Pantin in forming a humanitarian program to assist the poor and marginalised residents of the Laventille community. Hall agreed and together the two men walked through the dangerous neighbourhood, simply asking the residents how they could help them. This mission grew to become the SERVOL (Service Volunteered For All) voluntary organisation that now operates throughout Trinidad and Tobago and elsewhere in the Caribbean. While Hall returned to Barbados three months after the program started, he is recognised as one of SERVOL's co-founders.\n\nHall has served Barbados and West Indian cricket in a variety of roles since the end of his playing days including chairing the West Indies selection panel for some years. Hall also accompanied many touring West Indies teams as manager, including the ill-fated 1995 tour of England, marred by player unrest. In 2001 Hall was elected president of the West Indies Cricket Board. During his time as president Hall was instrumental in attracting the 2007 Cricket World Cup to the West Indies. Hall also developed a system of collective bargaining with the West Indies Players Association. Hall chose not to stand for re-election in 2003, citing health problems. Hall was a member of the board of directors of the Stanford 20/20 cricket project.\nAt the end of his career as a cricketer, Hall reflected, \"I realised that I’d been playing for ten years, and I was married with three children and I didn’t have any money.\" After working with SERVOL in Trinidad, Hall \"knew from that moment on, [he] would commit [his] life to service.\" He studied Industrial Relations and Human Resource Management at the Industrial Society in London and then returned to Cable and Wireless in Barbados to take a role as Regional Staff Welfare Manager. As well as his role with WITCO in Trinidad, Hall also had high-profile roles in private enterprise with Banks Barbados Brewery and Sandals Resorts.\n\nHall became involved in Barbadian politics, joining the Democratic Labour Party. First appointed to the Barbados Senate, Hall was later elected to the House of Assembly. Hall was elected as the representative for the Assembly constituency of St. Michael West Central in 1986 and re-elected in 1991. In 1987 Hall was appointed Minister of Tourism and Sports in the Government of Barbados. As Tourism Minister, Hall has been given credit for developing the sports tourism market in Barbados.\n\nOn a visit to Florida in 1990, Hall attended a Christian religious service. Impressed by the preacher, during the service, Hall \"made a very serious decision to give [his] heart and life to God.\" Hall attended Bible school and was later ordained a minister in the Christian Pentecostal Church. Notably, Hall ministered to fellow Barbadian fast bowler Malcolm Marshall while Marshall was dying from colon cancer.\n\nHall is a member of the West Indies Cricket Hall of Fame. and the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. For his work in tourism, Hall has been awarded the Caribbean Tourism Organisation's Lifetime Achievement Award. The University of the West Indies awarded Hall an honorary Doctorate of Laws in 2005. Hall and fellow Barbadian fast bowler Charlie Griffith have a grandstand at Kensington Oval named after them—the Hall & Griffith Stand. Hall was knighted in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to sport and the community.\n\nHall was a tall and muscular cricketer, tall and bearing the \"physique and strength of a bodybuilder.\" He had a graceful, classical action and one of the longest run-ups in Test cricket. A genuinely fast bowler, he was timed at . Hall was able to sustain pace and hostility for very long spells—during the Test against England at Lord's in 1963 he bowled unchanged for over three hours on the final day. While Hall was an aggressive fast bowler, he was not one to set out to injure the batsman. The England cricketer Ted Dexter—himself hit several times by Hall—said \"there was never a hint of malice in [Hall] or in his bowling\". Hall himself said after one of his deliveries fractured Australian cricketer Wally Grout's jaw \"It made me sick to see Wal leaving and it made me sicker to hear some jokers in the crowd ranting on as though I had intentionally hurt [Grout]\".\n\nWhile Hall could never be described as an all-rounder, on occasions he was an effective batsman. His one century in first-class cricket was against Cambridge University Cricket Club at Fenners—scored in 65 minutes, the fastest century of the 1963 English season. \"Wisden\" said of this innings, \"[Hall's] batting promised so much ... [he] made his runs in the classic mould, not in the unorthodox manner usually adopted by fast bowlers.\" With his characteristic humour, Hall said of this innings, \"Ah, but it wasn't any old hundred, it was against the intelligentsia.\"\n\nHall was one of the most popular cricketers of his day. The Australian commentator Johnnie Moyes described Hall as \"a rare box-office attraction, a man who caught and held the affections of the paying public.\" Hall was particularly popular in Australia. When invited back to play for Queensland in the Sheffield Shield in 1961–62, Hall arrived in Brisbane to \"scenes more in keeping with the arrival of a pop star, a thousand people jamming the old terminal building at Eagle Farm airport to welcome him.\" Hall was fond of a bet and was a keen follower of horseracing. Hall is known as a good humoured man; C. L. R. James observed \"Hall simply exudes good nature at every pore.\" Tony Cozier states \"[Hall] is renowned for his entertaining, if prolonged oratory, as well as for his tardiness.\"\n\n\n"}

It aired in the United States on January 16, 2004 and in the United Kingdom on January 21, 2004.\n\nTeenager Roscoe is trying to help his best friend, Samantha. Sam's band, the Zetta Bytes, are struggling. Despite her vocal talents and guitar skills, Sam is told that she needs to dance in order for their band to succeed. Roscoe uses his father's computerized holographic equipment to create a sentient, autonomous humanoid hologram called Loretta to dance for the band.\n\nAt their first gig, a school dance, Loretta is a big hit with the audience. The entire band loves her, except for Sam, who is jealous of Loretta's \"perfection,\" and suspects that Roscoe likes Loretta more than her. Despite her feelings, Sam agrees to take care of Loretta to keep Roscoe's father from finding and deleting her. The Zetta Bytes second performance goes well - until the very end when Loretta starts to lose her pattern, and the crowd realizes she is a hologram. After a moment of silence, the crowd erupts in applause. The novelty of a holographic rockstar catapults the Zetta Bytes to fame. Sam becomes jealous of the attention Loretta is receiving while Loretta struggles with her identity as a software computer program and hologram. She wants to experience life as a real human being. After a major argument with Roscoe, Loretta escapes into the internet, and emails herself to Sam's computer. Roscoe becomes frantic, and rushes to Sam's place for help.\n\nDuring which, Sam confronts him on his real feelings for Loretta. Sam reminds him that Loretta is not real. When Roscoe rebuffs her statement asking \"What is real, anyway?\" It's then that Sam states that she's real and she's always been there. Sam tries to make it more obvious that she has romantic feelings for Roscoe by kissing him. But when he doesn't respond to her affection, Sam's left hurt. She gives him Loretta and leaves. Later on, Roscoe realizes that Sam was right and soon realizes he may return his feelings for Sam.\n\nRoscoe and his father attend a meeting with Harshtone Records, the company that is recording The Zetta Bytes's first CD. Harshtone informs Roscoe that they have decided to team up with Skygraph, his father's company, and make more holographic rock stars. But when Roscoe realizes that they are planning to rob the holograms of their individuality, he argues that Loretta is not just a computer program, but a sentient, autonomous person with a mind and will of her own sensations, thoughts, personality, feelings, and emotions. Despite Roscoe's father siding with him, Loretta is taken from them. At the last moment Daryl Fibbs, an employee at Harshtone, has a change of heart and decides that every performer, including holograms like Loretta, should have a choice. He gives her the option to stay at Harshtone or escape into the internet. Loretta goes into the internet a second time, and Fibbs quits Harshtone.\n\nUnfortunately, the Zetta Bytes cannot find Loretta before their next concert. Sam tries to replace Loretta on stage, but falls, slipping into a coma. When Loretta comes back out of the web and sees that Sam is unconscious, she enters Sam's brain through an EEG machine in an effort to help her. She arrives in Sam's mind, finding Sam caught in her own depression. Loretta shows Sam that she hates that everyone thinks she is perfect, and that she envies Sam's ability to learn. They discover that there is only enough room for one of them in Sam's brain at a time. Sam wakes from her coma, with Loretta inside of her mind. In a real body for the first time, Loretta goes outside into the rain. A lightning strike hits Sam and when she wakes up, it appears that Loretta is gone forever.\n\nAt the Zetta Bytes' final performance, Sam sings about Loretta's death. She and Roscoe are finally together. After Sam finishes singing, the band realizes there was an extra voice singing the harmony. Roscoe sees Loretta's ghostly figure in the spotlight, and he comments that The Zetta Bytes have a guardian angel.\n\n\nOn January 16, 2004, the soundtrack to \"Pixel Perfect\" was released on CD by Disney Records.

{"id": "1956667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956667", "title": "Osmoconformer", "text": "Osmoconformer\n\nOsmoconformers are marine organisms that maintain an internal environment which is isotonic to their external environment. This means that the osmotic pressure of the organism's cells is equal to the osmotic pressure of their surrounding environment. By minimizing the osmotic gradient, this subsequently minimizes the net influx and efflux of water into and out of cells. Even though osmoconformers have an internal environment that is isosmotic to their external environment, the types of ions in the two environments differ greatly in order to allow critical biological functions to occur.\n\nAn advantage of osmoconformation is that such organisms don’t need to expend as much energy as osmoregulators in order to regulate ion gradients. However, to ensure that the correct types of ions are in the desired location, a small amount of energy is expended on ion transport. A disadvantage to osmoconformation is that the organisms are subject to changes in the osmolarity of their environment.\n\nMost osmoconformers are marine invertebrates such as echinoderms (such as starfish), mussels, marine crabs, lobsters, jellyfish, ascidians (sea squirts - primitive chordates), and scallops. Some insects are also osmoconformers. Some osmoconformers, such as echinoderms, are stenohaline, which means they can only survive in a limited range of external osmolarities. The survival of such organisms is thus contingent on their external osmotic environment remaining relatively constant. On the other hand, some osmoconformers are classified as euryhaline, which means they can survive in a broad range of external osmolarities. Mussels are a prime example of a euryhaline osmoconformer. Mussels have adapted to survive in a broad range of external salinities due to their ability to close their shells which allows them to seclude themselves from unfavorable external environments.\n\nThere are a couple of examples of osmoconformers that are craniates such as hagfish, skates and sharks. Their body fluid is isoosmotic with seawater, but their high osmolarity is maintained by making the concentration of organic solutes unnaturally high. Sharks concentrate urea in their bodies, and since urea denatures proteins at high concentrations, they also accumulate trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) to counter the effect. Sharks adjust their internal osmolarity according to the osmolarity of the sea water surrounding them. Rather than ingesting sea water in order to change their internal salinity, sharks are able to absorb sea water directly. This is due to the high concentration of urea kept inside their bodies. This high concentration of urea creates a diffusion gradient which permits the shark to absorb water in order to equalize the concentration difference. The crab-eating frog, or Rana cancrivora, is an example of a vertebrate osmoconformer. The crab-eating frog also regulates its rates of urea retention and excretion, which allows them to survive and maintain their status as osmoconformers in a wide range of external salinities. Hagfish maintain an internal ion composition plasma that differs from that of seawater. The internal ionic environment of hagfish contains a lower concentration of divalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4 2-) and a slightly higher concentration of monovalent ions. Hagfish therefore have to expend some energy for osmoregulation.\n\nIon gradients are crucial to many major biological functions on a cellular level. Consequently, the ionic composition of an organism's internal environment is highly regulated with respect to its external environment. Osmoconformers have adapted so that they utilize the ionic composition of their external environment, which is typically seawater, in order to support important biological functions. For instance, seawater has a high concentration of sodium ions, which helps support muscle contraction and neuronal signaling when paired with high internal concentrations of potassium ions.\n"}

Columnist Jeffrey D. Sadow attributed the lack of municipal funds for such raises to the recurring high costs associated with the operation of CenturyLink, which cost $1,500 per resident, or $55.6 million, nearly $20 million more than had been anticipated by city officials. Through 2013, the city spent $5 million more to operate the center. Minor league sports teams, unable to survive, abandoned the CenturyLink. In 2013 alone, the city transferred $750,000 into CenturyLink and still ran a deficit of $200,000. Those costs could have funded the pay raises Walker proposed.

Several new players were signed, as the NIFL managed the Marshals for the remainder of the 2004 season.\n\nIn 2005 owner H. P. Patterson first surrendered the team after he did not pay players for well over a month, and then fled the United States entirely after being suspected of money laundering. The mismanagement resulted in the resignation of the team's coach, former Houston Oilers coach Ed Biles, and the dissolution of the Diamond Deputies cheerleading squad, after they claimed weeks of unpaid game checks. In Addition, the Assistant Coach Hubbard Alexander and the Equipment Director Josh Reasoner followed Coach Biles out.\n\nDespite all this, new coach Tony Wells and quarterback Brett Dietz led the team to the finish of an 8-6 record, which tied them for 2nd in their division with the Dayton Warbirds. In the First round of playoffs they upset the River City Rage, who was ranked first in the same division as the Marshals with the Marshals with 67 points and the Rage with 64 points. In the next playoff round they defeated the Fayetteville Guard 70 to 69. In the Atlantic Conference Championship they had no such luck, falling to the Rome Renegades 51 to 41.\n\nFormer Cincinnati Marshals quarterback Brett Dietz played for many years in the Arena Football League and other indoor football leagues. He won Co-Rookie of the Year in the AFL for the 2007 season. The Marshals have been mentioned on ESPN when they talk about Dietz's career.\n\nIn the following months, the team's status was left largely undetermined. On December 20, 2005, after many months of speculation, the Marshals announced a return to the NIFL for the 2006 season with a new ownership group led by Doug Hortman and P.J. Conboy, a new coaching staff led by head coach Steve Carpenter and the return of the Diamond Deputies. The team matched their 2005 regular season output, going 8-6 in the season, and clinched the #5 seed in the Atlantic Conference playoffs.\n\nThe Marshals could not avoid the game of \"musical teams\" that seemed to doom the league (the consequence of a failed expansion project) even before the playoffs began. Cincinnati's 5th seed was supposed to equal a road trip to a rematch of a late-season loss to Osceola. Osceola, however, commenced a tug-of-war with the league and the Marshals regarding the site of the game. Osceola's home arena was hosting a rodeo the weekend of the first round, and asked Cincinnati to host the game. However, Cincinnati had been thrown out of their arena due to setup for a concert. Osceola offered a compromise, where the Marshals would travel to Lakeland, Florida, but team ownership shot down the idea and forfeited the game.\n\nA few days after the announced forfeit, it was revealed that Osceola failed to file paperwork so they could advance into the playoffs. Osceola was given a choice: either play Cincinnati in St. Louis with the winner playing the River City Rage the next night, or forfeit the game and allow Cincinnati to advance to play River City. Osceola declined, and Cincinnati was allowed to advance. With only three days and one practice to prepare for the game, Cincinnati traveled to St. Louis, where the Rage defeated the Marshals at Scottrade Center, 43-30, ending the Marshals' season.\n\nOn October 18, 2006, it was announced that the AF2 had granted a new expansion team to the U.S. Bank Arena, in the form of the Cincinnati Jungle Kats, who took over the indoor football contract for the arena. As a consequence, the Marshals had no arena to call their own. It was originally thought that they were moving to Wall2Wall Soccer in nearby Mason for 2007, . However, they moved to Hara Arena in Dayton for 2007, and changing their name to The Marshals. .\n\nThe announcement was even more of a shock to players and staff, seeing as no formal conference was given, no owner-team meeting was ever held, and all but owner Doug Hortman and his assistant were made to research the information through a short press release on a skeletal form of the Marshals website, leaving fans irate. The Marshals went quietly up to Dayton, a move similar to the 1983 overnight move of the Baltimore Colts to Indianapolis.\n\nThe 2007 season was played, but was not completed in full, due to the collapse of the NIFL. At the time the team was 2-4. Owner Doug Hortman was interviewed by the \"Dayton Daily News\", in which he accused the NIFL of lying to him and other owners about league development and scheduling. Hortman would then go on to promise the return of the team for 2008, which proved to be a lie. This was the same promise Hortman had made when he announced during halftime of the final home game in 2006 that the team would return to Cincinnati in 2007.\n\nHowever, the promise was once again kept unfulfilled, and the team went away quietly, along with the rest of the NIFL.\n\n!Totals || 23 || 27 || 0\n\n"}

After the IPFL folded, the team moved to the National Indoor Football League in 2002 and became the RiverCity Renegades. The team finished its first season in the NIFL with a 1-13 record. For 2003–2004, the team was renamed the Show-Me Believers. In the first season under the new name, the team finished with a 4-10 record that showed improvement, despite being a losing record. In 2004, the team's skill increased vastly, and completed the season with a winning record for the first time at 9-5. In 2005, the team was renamed and is currently the RiverCity Rage. The Rage won the 2005 East Atlantic Conference Division with a record of 10-4. With this record, the team was locked in a three-way tie for the best regular-season record; however, the team lost its Conference Quarter Finals game 67 to 64 to the Cincinnati Marshals.\n\nThe next season, the team finished in a four-way tie for the regular season record at 13-1, and advanced to the Atlantic Conference championship game, losing to the Fayetteville Guard.\n\nAfter the 2006 season, the Rage announced they were joining United Indoor Football for 2007. The Rage continued their membership in the United Indoor Football for 2008.\n\nIn 2008, the RiverCity Rage struggled through a seven-game losing streak before winning three of their last four games to make the playoffs. They won (37-33) by a last minute touchdown in a home playoff game against the Sioux City Bandits, but lost the Conference Finals on the road to the Bloomington Extreme, 33-7.\n\nIn 2009, the Rage played in the Indoor Football League, a new league created out of the merger between the UIF and the Intense Football League. On August 15, 2009, the Rage lost the United Bowl to the Billings Outlaws by the score of 71-62.\n\nJeff Sprowls, who also owns IFL team the Omaha Beef, announced about a month after the Rage's loss in the IFL Championship game that the RiverCity Rage would be ceasing operations and will not play in the 2010 season, due to financial issues in Omaha . According to the Indoor Football League website the RiverCity Rage could return in 2011, if new owners are found.

They played home games at the Cumberland County Crown Coliseum from 2005 to 2010.\n\nThe Guard were replaced by the Fayetteville Force in the Southern Indoor Football League (SIFL) for the 2011 season. After a 3–0 start to the 2011 SIFL season, the Force collapsed and was eventually sold to the AIFA. The Force did not return in 2012 and were replaced the Cape Fear Heroes expansion team as part of American Indoor Football.\n\nThe teams began play in 2003 as the Myrtle Beach Stingrays of the National Indoor Football League in the Myrtle Beach Convention Center, compiling a 6–8 record in their inaugural season. After two games in the 2004 season, the NIFL shut down the team due to the team owners, April Coble and Jack Bowman, failing to pay the players and other obligations. However, local investors including then head coach Terry Smith, saved the team in time to schedule a third game at the Staten Island Xtreme the last weekend of April. On April 29, the team was moved to Florence, South Carolina, for the remainder of the season as the Carolina Stingrays with seven home games at the Florence Civic Center. The relocated team finished with a 3–6 record in Florence and a final 5–7 record in their second season.\n\nThe following year, the team was purchased again and moved to Fayetteville to replace af2's Cape Fear Wildcats, who had moved to Albany, Georgia, as the South Georgia Wildcats. The new team had originally been called the Fayetteville Heat, but later changed their name to the Fayetteville Guard. The team started their season 0–5, but went 7–2 in their final nine regular season games, earning a 7–7 record and a playoff berth. The team defeated the Dayton Warbirds in the first round, but lost to the Cincinnati Marshals in the divisional round.\n\nThe Guard did better in 2006, posting a 13–1 record in the regular season, then defeating the Lakeland Thunderbolts and River City Rage en route to Indoor Bowl VI, where they lost to the Billings Outlaws.\n\nIn August 2006, it was reported that the Guard were moving to the World Indoor Football League. However, the Guard denied these rumors by announcing that they were staying in the NIFL in a press conference two months later. During the 2007 season, the Guard and Wyoming Cavalry organized with owners of other independently owned NIFL teams to ensure they had a complete season, but without the approval of the rapidly falling apart NIFL management, which led to a midseason schedule split between the league-owned teams and the independent teams. Both the Guard and Cavalry were subsequently expelled from the NIFL before the post season. They played against each other in the Budweiser Indoor Football Championship Bowl, where the Guard won 48–34. Both teams joined the American Indoor Football Association (AIFA) the following 2008 season.\n\nFollowing the 2010 AIFA season, the league split into two leagues: the AIFA West and East. The AIFA East, of which Fayetteville was a member, then merged into the Southern Indoor Football League (SIFL) for the 2011 season . However, a new Fayetteville-based sports marketing group claimed the rights to field a SIFL team in the Fayetteville market and the Guard did not return for the 2011 season. The new team, not affiliated with the Guard or its owners, were called the Fayetteville Force. After a 3–0 start to the 2011 SIFL season, the team collapsed.\n\nThe AIFA entered into an asset purchase agreement of selected assets of the Fayetteville Force from Fanteractive, LLC, the Force's parent company, but the AIFA did not purchase the corporation that was operating the Force. Under the agreement the AIFA retained the Force name, logo, likeness, playing equipment, and the artificial turf. The AIFA guaranteed that it would play the remaining four Force games with the Southern Indoor Football League.\n\nDue to contractual issues between the previous owner and his players and coaches at the time, the AIFA was unable to take over those contracts. On two-day notice before the Erie away game, the AIFA had to assemble a team of available players from a group of former indoor players and rookies. The AIFA selected as head coach Matt Steeple, a veteran indoor coach from the Indoor Football League for the balance of the 2011 season. The new Fayetteville Force never won a game and has the dubious distinction of setting a record for the largest single-game losing margin and points allowed in the history of indoor football – in any league – following a 0–138 loss to the Erie Explosion on May 21, 2011.\n\nThe AIFA reorganized as American Indoor Football (AIF) after the SIFL folded following its lone 2011 season. The Force did not return in 2012 and were replaced the Cape Fear Heroes expansion team in the AIF.\n\n"}

They are a member of the American Indoor Football Association. The team began play as the Montgomery Maulers of the National Indoor Football League and won the Atlantic Conference Central Division Championship in 2005. The 2005 season ended in the conference playoff semifinals of the Rome Renegades, who went on to appear in the NIFL Championship Indoor Bowl V.\n\nThe team folded in October 2007.\n\nLate in April 2006, the second year of the club's existence, Donald Jackson, an attorney representing members of the team said the club had not paid the players, staff or coaches in more than a month. The team's owner (Jamie LaMunyon) made national news on April 27, 2006, by terminating the contracts of all players and announcing that replacements would be hired. \n\nOn May 3, 2006, the Maulers came under new ownership. After losing five of their first six games, the team has rallied under new management, winning five of the next six (the lone defeat was a 1-point overtime loss in an away game). The Maulers showed their renewed tenacity most recently in the Osceola rematch. After a downed Montgomery player was speared in the back of the head (with no penalty having been assessed), the teams broke out into a 17-minute bench clearing brawl resulting in 19 players being ejected. Montgomery managed to overcome a 15-point deficit in the fourth quarter to pull off the 1 point win. Although this was officially the second time these teams have played, the first meeting was actually fielded by players from the SSFL's Gulf Coast Raiders (a team owned by Michael Mink) due to the previously mentioned contract disputes. Following the loss, Michael Mink and John Morris decided to become more involved with arena football and purchased the Maulers franchise with Mink becoming head coach and Morris becoming general manager. Subsequently, a number of Raiders players have been signed to the Maulers roster, which has brewed speculation that the Raiders will be used as a farm team for the Maulers.\n\nFollowing a drumming by the top ranked Fayetteville Guard, the Maulers were 6-7 overall and surprisingly made the playoffs. Tied for 7th place in the conference with the Charleston Sandsharks who was scheduled in the final game of the regular season, the winner was to receive the final playoff spot (only 6 teams per conference would qualify). The Maulers lost the game 28-39, but Charleston's general manager Al Bannister had already stated the organization would skip the playoffs and focus on next season. It was noticed that the official NIFL web site had an asterisk by the team's name and stated no team with outstanding operational items (stats) would be eligible for the playoffs. Later, it was revealed the franchise had cheated by using at least six illegal players and also had outstanding fines due to administrative issues (not exchanging film with opponents or keeping statistics at home games). Subsequently, the Sandsharks were banned from the playoffs for the infractions, with the Maulers being awarded the sixth Atlantic conference spot. However this all proved academic as the Maulers lost in the first week of the playoffs on July 8 at Lakeland. Falling behind 27-0 in the first quarter, Montgomery stormed back but could not make the comeback falling 70-62; they ended their season 7-8.\n\nAfter the 2006 season, the team announced they were changing their name to the Montgomery Bears and moving to the American Indoor Football Association.\n\n!Totals || 21 || 24 || 0\n\n"}

He spent most of his childhood growing up in the McDougald Terrace housing project in Durham. His father, who left the family and moved to Texas when Rogers was a toddler, died when Rogers was eight.\n\nEstella Rogers sustained severe head injuries and required two operations when she was nearly killed in an automobile wreck in 1988. She was in a coma for more than two weeks and remained hospitalized for three more months. Even after she returned home she still had memory loss and needed extra care. While his mother recovered, Rogers moved in with Nathaniel Brooks, who was once his youth league coach, spending his last two seasons at Hillside High School with the Brooks family.\n\nHis stepfather James Spencer, who was the only man Rogers called \"Dad\", died of lung cancer in February 1990. Renita, the oldest of the Rogers children, became a nurse at N.C. Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill. His oldest brother Stacy, who attended the Eastern N.C. School for the Deaf in Wilson and the N.C. School for the Deaf in Morganton, won a gold medal in basketball at the 1981 XIV Deaflympics (aka \"World Games for the Deaf\" and \"World Deaf Olympics\") in Cologne, Germany. After that he worked for the Veterans Administration Hospital in Durham. Stanley, his other brother, served over 10 years (1981–1991) of a 20-year sentence for armed robbery at Central Prison in Raleigh.\n\nRogers attended Hillside High School in Durham. As an athlete, he was known as \"the Durham Bull.\" He was a two-time \"Greensboro News & Record\" All-State selection, and was named the 1990 North Carolina state Player of the Year. As a junior, he averaged 22.5 points and 9.7 rebounds, and in his senior year he averaged 28.3 points and 12.3 rebounds on a team that finished 27-2 and advanced to the quarterfinals of the state 4-A playoffs. He was named McDonald's All-American and scored 17 points in the game.\n\nFrom 1990 until 1993, Rogers played college basketball at Wake Forest University, where he won the 1990-1991 season Rookie of the Year honor (over Grant Hill) and was the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in 1993, averaging 21.2 points and 7.4 rebounds. His final college statistics were 19.3 points and 7.9 rebounds, and he was the number nine draft pick in the 1993 NBA draft for the Denver Nuggets.\n\nRogers's college jersey #54 was retired in February 1996 by the Demon Deacons.\n\nRogers played two years for Denver, spending his rookie year primarily as a bench player for a team which was the first 8th-ranked team in NBA Playoffs history to beat a first-seeded team, the Seattle SuperSonics. Rogers had one significant game in his rookie year, against the Utah Jazz on February 8, 1994. Near the end of the game, Rogers hit three 3-pointers in a span of nine seconds to bring the Nuggets from a 94-86 deficit to a 95-94 lead. However, Jeff Malone hit a jumper with 12 seconds remaining to give the Jazz the 96-95 win.\n\nRogers became a starter his second season, in large part due to frequent injuries suffered by LaPhonso Ellis. On June 28, 1995, Rogers was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, with draft rights to guard Brent Barry, for the draft rights to forward Antonio McDyess and guard Randy Woods. He spent four years with the Clippers.\n\nRogers signed with the Phoenix Suns in 1999. He averaged 13.8 points per game coming off the bench and won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2000. The Suns entered the playoffs that year, but lost to the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers. Rogers remained with the Suns until February 2002, when he was traded to the Boston Celtics for Joe Johnson.\n\nRogers signed with the New Jersey Nets as a free agent on August 14, 2002, to fill a gap at power forward and give the team much-needed firepower off the bench. During his first year with the Nets he averaged 7 points per game as a bench player. The high point of his season was during a playoff game against the Milwaukee Bucks on April 24, 2003. After missing two free throws, Rogers came back on the next possession to hit the game-winning shot. The Nets won that series and went on to make the NBA Finals, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs. Rogers saw more playing time the next year, mainly due to some frontcourt injuries, but the quality of his play had declined.\n\nHe signed with the New Orleans Hornets on August 3, 2004. He was injured for much of the early part of that season, but eventually became a team starter. On February 24, 2005, Rogers was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, along with injured forward Jamal Mashburn, for also-injured forward Glenn Robinson. He was primarily used as a backup forward for the 76ers.\n\nRight after being drafted by the Denver Nuggets, in the summer of 1993, Rogers married Tisa White. They had three children together, two girls (Roddreka and Rydeiah) and one son (Rodney Rogers II). Roddreka, who was born December 1, 1993, underwent a 5½-hour emergency neurological operation when she was just two months old. Rodney and Tisa have since divorced.\n\nAfter Rogers was traded to the Phoenix Suns in 1999, the family made Paradise Valley, Arizona their permanent home until 2006. Tisa returned to Durham to take over her father's family real estate business, in which Rogers was an investor. He returned to Durham in 2006 and went to work for the City of Durham as a heavy equipment operator. Rogers was promoted to supervisor in the spring of 2008. Most of his Public Works Department co-workers did not know he had been in the NBA and set for life financially until his dirt bike accident later that year.\n\nRogers is the cousin of former New England Patriots linebacker Tully Banta-Cain.\n\nRogers was a volunteer girls' basketball coach at Rogers-Herr Middle School., and he co-founded the Durham Eagles youth football team. He enjoyed hunting, riding motorcycles and ATVs, horseback riding and fishing. He is a NASCAR fan and loves big trucks and construction equipment.\n\nOn November 28, 2008, Rogers was involved in a dirt bike crash in rural Vance County north of Raleigh. Rogers hit a ditch while riding through a trail and flipped over his vehicle's handlebars. He was first flown to Duke University Medical Center, then on December 3 was moved by air ambulance to the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Georgia, which specializes in rehabilitating people with spinal cord and/or brain injuries. Rodney Rogers is paralyzed from the shoulders down as a result of the accident, and doctors have given him only a 5% chance of ever walking again.\n\n"}

The team's nickname was a tribute to the oil industry, which has been the source of Odessa's wealth over the past century.\n\nThe team began operations in 2004 as the Odessa Roughnecks, a charter member of the Intense Football League (IFL). In 2005, the IFL merged with the NIFL. For the 2006 season, the IFL was resurrected, and the Odessa Roughnecks returned to their original league. In 2008 the Intense Football League merged again, this time with the UIF to create the Indoor Football League.\n\nThe team played its home games at the Ector County Coliseum in Odessa. The team was sold by its original owner (Tommy Benizio) in September 2008 to Allegiance Pro Sports, Inc. In January 2010, Dale and Jay Morris of Midland, Texas purchased the Roughnecks from Allegiance Pro Sports.\n\nThe Roughnecks were coached by Chris Williams. The 2011 season will be Coach Williams's eighth season with the Roughnecks. \n\nThe Roughnecks won its first championship in 2006 at Intense Bowl 2 by beating the Corpus Christi Hammerheads 97–56, which was an Intense Football League record for most points scored by one team in a game. The team finished with an overall record of 14–2.\n\nUp through the 2009 season games were broadcast on KMCM, and KQRX broadcast the games in 2009–2011. With the LSFL having games available online through America One, no radio contract was made during the 2012 season.\n\nFor the 2012 season, the Roughnecks moved to the Lone Star Football League. After the 2012 season, the team was put up for sale and never purchased. It was announced on October 16, 2013, that a new team would replace the Roughnecks at the Ector County Coliseum in 2014 – the West Texas Wildcatters. Like the Roughnecks did in their last season, the Wildcatters competed in the LSFL.\n\nIn 2003, the nearly 20-year-old Arena Football League, which until then had been primarily in major markets like New York City and Chicago, began spreading across the nation into smaller to middle-sized cities. Jerry Jones of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys kicked off his AFL franchise in Dallas and secured the rights to every smaller market in the state of Texas with a suitable arena for indoor football. When Jones couldn’t be reached to discuss selling these rights, a new league was formed throughout the state. In August 2003, Chad Dittman, President of the fledgling Intense Football League announced that Odessa would be one of the sites for his new professional indoor football league.\n\nThrough prayer shortly after, Abby and Tommy Benizio decided to purchased the franchise and moved to the Permian Basin along with their pet prairie dogs. By the close of 2003, the franchise creatively announced the name of \"Roughnecks\" along with the unveiling of a logo fit for the community and a mascot who has become a staple in both Odessa and Midland known as Digger.\n\nThe team kicked off on May 8, 2004 under the direction of head coach Chris Williams, who led the team to a 9-7 record and home field advantage in the playoffs. Lubbock defeated Odessa in overtime just one game shy of the championship but the season did not end without the success of leading the IFL in attendance and having promoted more players to the next level than any other team in the league.\n\nThis success became well known throughout the national football community, and along with the hard work of the teams coaches, Odessa enjoyed a very rare undefeated regular season in the National Indoor Football League in 2005. Despite losing one game shy of the championship again, the Roughnecks were once more atop of their league in attendance, successfully hosted the first ever NIFL All-Star Game, and could boast a 16-1 overall record.\n\nThe team was later bought by Jay and Dale Morris of Midland, Texas, who changed the team name to the West Texas Roughnecks.\n\nFor the 2012 season, the Roughnecks joined the Lone Star Football League. After the season, the team was put up for sale. With no buyer stepping forward, the team officially folded in October 2013.\n\nThe Roughnecks at one time held the longest regular-season winning streak in professional football history with 27 straight regular-season victories under the arm of Bobby Glenn Ruth Jr. The record was broken with a 55–35 win over the Laredo Lobos in Odessa on June 17, 2006, giving the Roughnecks 26 straight regular season wins. The streak began with a 20-0 victory against the San Angelo Stampede on July 31, 2004, in San Angelo, Texas and ended at 27 wins with a 70-63 loss against the Louisiana Swashbucklers on July 1, 2006, in Lake Charles, Louisiana. On March 29, 2008, the Sioux Falls Storm of the United Indoor Football League lost to the Omaha Beef 34-18, ending their historic 40-game winning streak and giving them their first loss since July 15, 2005.

It was submitted to the House Committee on Science and Astronautics of the United States House of Representatives in the 87th United States Congress on April 18, 1961.\n\nThe report has become noted for one short section entitled \"The implications of a discovery of extraterrestrial life\", which examines the potential implications of such a discovery on public attitudes and values. The section briefly considers possible public reactions to some possible scenarios for the discovery of extraterrestrial life, stressing a need for further research in this area. It recommended continuing studies to determine the likely social impact of such a discovery and its effects on public attitudes, including study of the question of how leadership should handle information about such a discovery and under what circumstances leaders might or might not find it advisable to withhold such information from the public. The significance of this section of the report is a matter of controversy. Persons who believe that extraterrestrial life has already been confirmed and that this information is being withheld by government from the public sometimes turn to this section of the report as support for their view. Frequently cited passages from this section of the report are drawn both from its main body and from its footnotes.\n\nThe report has been mentioned in newspapers such as The New York Times, The Baltimore Sun, The Washington Times, and the Huffington Post.\n\nThe report was entered into the \"Congressional Record\", which is currently archived at over 1110 libraries as part of the Federal Depository Library Program.\n\nThe main author Donald N. Michael was a \"social psychologist with a background in the natural sciences.\" \"He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues and the World Academy of Art and Science.\"\n\nOver 50 years after the report was initially released the Brookings Institution again focused on space policy by hosting \"several panels of experts to discuss topics such as the economic benefits of private industry’s involvement, the scientific discoveries resulting from NASA’s continued space efforts and the potential for future exploration, and the government’s policies and decision making process.\"\n\nAlthough the report discusses the need for research on many policy issues related to space exploration, it is most often cited for passages from its brief section on the implications of a discovery of extraterrestrial life. (See Section #Use in discussions about possible cover-ups)\n\nThe report contains the following chapters:\n\nIn a short section the report touches on the possibility of detecting evidence of extraterrestrial life and its implications, which includes the following passages:\nWhile face-to-face meetings with it will not occur within the next twenty years [that is the 1960s and 1970s] (unless its technology is more advanced than ours, qualifying it to visit Earth), artifacts left at some point in time by these life forms might possibly be discovered through our space activities on the Moon, Mars, or Venus.\n\nAnthropological files contain many examples of societies, sure of their place in the universe, which have disintegrated when they have had to associate with previously unfamiliar societies espousing different ideas and different life ways; others that survived such an experience usually did so by paying the price of changes in values and attitudes and behavior.\n\nSince intelligent life might be discovered at any time via the radio telescope research presently under way, and since the consequences of such a discovery are presently unpredictable because of our limited knowledge of behavior under even an approximation of such dramatic circumstances, two research areas can be recommended:\nAn individual's reactions to such a radio contact would in part depend on his cultural, religious, and social background, as well as on the actions of those he considered authorities and leaders, and their behavior, in turn, would in part depend on their cultural, social, and religious environment. The discovery would certainly be front-page news everywhere; the degree of political or social repercussion would probably depend on leadership's interpretation of (1) its own role, (2) threats to that role, and (3) national and personal opportunities to take advantage of the disruption or reinforcement of the attitudes and values of others. Since leadership itself might have great need to gauge the direction and intensity of public attitudes, to strengthen its own morale and for decision making purposes, it would be most advantageous to have more to go on than personal opinions about the opinions of the public and other leadership groups.\n\nThe knowledge that life existed in other parts of the universe might lead to a greater unity of men on Earth, based on the 'oneness' of man or on the age-old assumption that any stranger is threatening. Much would depend on what, if anything, was communicated between man and the other beings...\n\nSome footnotes also relate to detecting evidence of extraterrestrial life, for example:\n\nThe positions of the major American religious denominations, the Christian sects, and the Eastern religions on the matter of extraterrestrial life need elucidation. Consider the following: 'The Fundamentalist (and anti-science) sects are growing apace around the world... For them, the discovery of other life -- rather than any other space product -- would be electrifying. ...some scattered studies need to be made both in their home centers and churches and their missions, in relation to attitudes about space activities and extraterrestrial life.'\n\nIf plant life or some subhuman intelligence were found on Mars or Venus, for example, there is on the face of it no good reason to suppose these discoveries, after the original novelty had been exploited to the fullest and worn off, would result in substantial changes in perspectives or philosophy in large parts of the American public, at least any more than, let us say, did the discovery of the coelacanth or the panda.\n\nIf super intelligence is discovered, the results become quite unpredictable. It is possible that if the intelligence of these creatures were sufficiently superior to ours, they would choose to have little if any contact with us. On the face of it, there is no reason to believe that we might learn a great deal from them, especially if their physiology and psychology were substantially different from ours.\n\nIt has been speculated that, of all groups, scientists and engineers might be the most devastated by the discovery of relatively superior creatures, since these professions are most clearly associated with the mastery of nature, rather than with the understanding and expression of man. Advanced understanding of nature might vitiate all our theories at the very least, if not also require a culture and perhaps a brain inaccessible to Earth scientists.\n\nIt is perhaps interesting to note that when asked what the consequences of the discovery of superior life would be, an audience of \"Saturday Review\" readership chose, for the most part, not to answer the question at all, in spite of their detailed answers to many other speculative questions.\n\nA possible but not completely satisfactory means for making the possibility 'real' for many people would be to confront them with present speculations about the I.Q. of the porpoise and to encourage them to expand on the implications of this situation.\n\nSuch studies would include historical reactions to hoaxes, psychic manifestations, unidentified flying objects, etc. Hadley Cantril's study, \"Invasion from Mars\" (Princeton University Press, 1940), would provide a useful if limited guide in this area. Fruitful understanding might be gained from a comparative study of factors affecting the responses of primitive societies to exposure to technologically advanced societies. Some thrived, some endured, and some died.\n\nThe report is sometimes mentioned in discussions about possible government cover-ups of evidence of extraterrestrial life, such as discussions under blog entries of skeptic astronomer Phil Plait. Sometimes these mentions point out the existence of the report, sometimes they argue that the report is evidence of extraterrestrial life. For example, Richard C. Hoagland, a proponent of conspiracy theories, argues that the report, by outlining plausible motives for government suppression of a discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, furnishes evidence of an ongoing cover-up of intelligent extraterrestrial life already discovered. The National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena thinks the \"report gives weight to previous thinking by scholars who have suggested that the earth already may be under close scrutiny by advanced space races.\" \n\nIn an email published by The Virtually Strange Network, entitled \"Brookings Report Re-examined\", Keith Woodard writes that the Brookings Report:...did raise the possibility of withholding information, but took no position on its advisability. 'Questions one might wish to answer by such studies,' intoned the report, 'would include: how might such information, under what circumstances, be presented to or withheld from the public for what ends? What might be the role of the discovering scientists and other decision makers regarding release of the fact of discovery?' Those two sentences comprise the report's entire commentary on the subject of covering up the truth.\n\n\n"}

On June 30, 2016, the team announced it would go dormant for the 2017 season and beyond.\n\nThe Fever won one division title and three conference championships. They appeared in two United Bowls, most recently the 2012 United Bowl where they were defeated by the Sioux Falls Storm 59-32.\n\nThe Fever were founded and accepted into the National Indoor Football League (NIFL) September 2004. Craig Beverlin was tabbed as the team's first ever head coach. After an 0–2 start, Beverlin resigned as the head coach of the Fever, and starting quarterback Scott Mitchell quit the team. The team promoted Special Teams Coach, Dan Whitsett to head coach, and signed quarterback Doug Coleman to lead the team. The Fever rallied to a 9–5 regular season record, finishing 3rd in the Pacific West division. The Fever earned a berth in Indoor Bowl V on July 30, 2005, where they defeated the Rome Renegades 47–31 in Kennewick.\n\nAfter the 2006 season, the Fever announced they were leaving the NIFL. On September 4, it was confirmed that they were moving to United Indoor Football, along with the Billings Outlaws and River City Rage. The league was expected to make an official announcement at a press conference sometime on the weekend of September 11, and was also hoping to add the Rapid City Flying Aces and Wyoming Cavalry soon. However, Tri-Cities instead joined the af2 which had in-state rival Spokane.\n\nThe new ownership had introduced a new logo, with team colors and uniforms that were reminiscent of the Miami Dolphins on December 13, 2006 (left), but because of general fan dislike, the team announced on January 9, 2007 that they would be switching back to their old color scheme and logo.\n\nThere had been speculation that the Fever would fold after the 2009 season, however, on September 6, it was announced that J. R. and Teri Carr had bought back the team from Texas af2 holdings, ensuring the Fever would return for the 2010 season. Later that month, it was announced that the af2 was shutting down and the new Arena Football 1 (AF1) was taking its place, including the Fever as a charter team. The Fever would drop out of the AF1 however on November 19 as the Tier 2 division, which the Fever were slated to be in, was scrapped by the league due to a lack of teams. So the Fever joined the Indoor Football League based in Richmond, Virginia.

On April 26, 2009 Head coach Richard Davis was fired after an 0–5 start to the season. On April 27, Pat O'Hara, Head coach of the Arena Football League's Los Angeles Avengers was named Head coach of the Fever while the AFL was suspended. O'Hara was going to remain Fever coach for the 2010 season in the IFL until he was offered head coaching job of the Orlando Predators of the af1. He was replaced by former Spokane Shock head coach Adam Shackleford. Shackleford coached the Fever to a record 50 wins in 6 seasons as the head coach. He has since returned to the Shock.

{"id": "1956776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956776", "title": "Jagdkommando", "text": "Jagdkommando\n\nThe Jagdkommando (German for \"Hunting Commando\") is the Austrian Armed Forces' Special Operations group.\n\nThe duties of this elite unit, like its counterparts such as the United States Army Special Forces, are chiefly counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency, among others. Jagdkommando soldiers are highly trained professionals whose thorough and rigorous training enables them to take over when tasks or situations outgrow the capabilities and specialisation of conventional units.\n\nThe name “Jagdkommando” has its origins in the time of World War I, when small assault squads of the Austrian K.u.K. Army were called what translates to “manhunt command.”\n\nThe history of the Austrian Special Operations Forces began in 1961, when a group of Austrian officers participated in the US Army's Ranger School as part of their training in order to set up a similar course for the eventual establishment of Jagdkommando. Since then, the officers and soldiers of Jagdkommando have continued to evolve by taking part in similar courses in the United States and all over Europe and by combining the lessons learned with \"homegrown\" tactics and knowledge. The unit has earned the respect of other nations' special forces very quickly. The headquarters of the Jagdkommando is located in Wiener Neustadt.\n\nMost of the missions are classified, but the Jagdkommando usually operates in places where regular Austrian troops are also located - such as the Balkans (KFOR, etc.), Afghanistan (ISAF/Resolute Support) and Chad (EUFOR Tchad/RCA). In the east of Chad about 50 Jagdkommando soldiers were deployed to protect refugee camps near the border to Darfur from early 2008 to 2009.\n\nIn 2016, the Jagdkommando deployed to Mali alongside French Special Forces as part of Operation Barkhane. \n\n\nSelection is usually held once a year and has a duration of 6 months. The program normally begins in January with 3 weeks of pre-selection. During this time the candidate will take the physical tests required, receive additional training and undergo a 72-hour Field Exercise, which is the core event of the selection process.\n\nMost candidates will fail during the 72-hour exercise which includes long road marches in squad size elements, psychological test batteries, and total sleep deprivation. The pre-selection course is conducted by active operators as well as by enablers of the unit.\n\nNormally 20-25% of all candidates will pass the pre selection course and continue with the so-called Jagdkommandogrundkurs, the basic course of selection. The first few weeks are held in the remote area of Allentsteig, a giant military training area in close proximity to the Czech border. The first seven weeks of small unit tactics are overshadowed with plenty of snow, freezing weather, very small amounts of sleep and permanent physical performance. Candidates will get used to the heavy Lowe Rucksack and spend most of their day with it on their backs while conducting patrols, ambushes, and raids in the forests around Allentsteig.\n\nAfter the small unit tactics phase, which will eliminate the last few unfitting candidates, the basic course will continue with block course of two or three weeks each:\n\nThe final and most infamous course is the SERE training. Over the last few years the SERE training took part in the Alps of Salzburg. The “run phase” will last up to ten days, while the candidate must check in at a given checkpoints every 24 hours. The checkpoints are set 20–30 km apart, considering the mountains in between the points and the tactical need to stay off roads and trails, the candidates will be very busy meeting their time limits and rarely find sleep. Finally after days on the run and being hunted down by infantry units, helicopters and K9 units, the candidates will be ambushed and captured at one of their checkpoints. This marks the beginning of the “captivity phase”. Being the last phase of the selection course this phase will last 72 hours.\n\nAfter completing the SERE course the remaining soldiers (normally 10-15% of all applicants who started the pre selection course) are accepted into the Jagdkomamndo brotherhood and awarded the “mudd-green” beret with the Unit Crest on it. Most of the graduates will be given a slot as active operators in one of the two Task Groups of the unit, while some go back to their regular Army unit.\n\nJagdkommando soldiers take extreme pride in their long and unique selection course and the prestige that comes along with earning the olive beret inside the armed forces.\n\nIf a soldier is chosen to become an operator after selection he will attend the Einsatzausbildung 1, a course where he will refine his operator skills. The training will last up to one year.\n\nNormally it starts off with a five-week drivers course, followed by shooting classes. This will be the first time for operators to use the advanced weapon systems Steyr AUG A2 Kdo and the FN P90. After weeks at the shooting range the next courses will be very mountain orientated, like the mountain airborne course, winter warfare and mountaineering courses as well as ski training.\n\nAfter the mountain courses the individual job training will begin. Depending on the assignment the operator will attend the Weapon Sergeant Course, Medic Course, Communications Sergeant Course or Engineer Course.\n\nThe SOF CQB course that follows teaches the latest techniques in HRO, CC, and DDO. Jagdkommando operators train together with several NATO SOF units worldwide and so the used SOPs and tactics are very similar to other SOF units.\nDifferent other courses will complete the Einsatzausbildung 1, such as the Urban SR course, advanced combatives training and Air Assault techniques.\n\nAfter more than 18 months of training the operator will be assigned a team in the 1st SOTG (Special Operations Task Group) or the 2nd SOTG. The 3rd SOTG belongs to the Army Reserve Component. A typical Jagdkommando team consists of six operators: the Team Leader, Team Sergeant, a Weapons Sergeant/Sniper, Engineer Sergeant, Medic Sergeant and Communication Sergeant. Each team is assigned to one insertion speciality, such as freefall, amphibious, mountain and mobility.\n\n\n\n"}

They were most recently members of the Intense Conference in the Indoor Football League (IFL). The Cavalry began play in 2000 as an expansion member of the original Indoor Football League as the Casper Cavalry. The Cavalry became a charter member of the National Indoor Football League (NIFL) in 2001 following the original IFL's purchase by the Arena Football League's Orlando Predators. The move in 2001 also brought a franchise name change to the current Wyoming Cavalry. The team then joined the American Indoor Football Association (AIFA) in 2008 after the NIFL's demise. With the AIFA's presence in the Western United States dwindling, the Cavalry joined the IFL in 2011. In September, 2014, majority owner Mitch Zimmerman announced that the team would cease operations.\n\nThe Cavalry played their home games at the Casper Events Center.\n\nThe team began play in 2000 as an expansion member of the original Indoor Football League as the Casper Cavalry. Despite a successful inaugural season, they fell in the playoffs to the Black Hills Machine. When the original IFL folded, the Cavalry moved to the newly formed National Indoor Football League as the \"Wyoming Cavalry\" and became a charter member. The team also saw front office changes, as they were purchased by a local ownership group, headed by Mike Argeri Layton. The team was decently successful, making the playoffs in four of their seven overall seasons, as well as making it to the inaugural Indoor Bowl, losing to the Mississippi Fire Dogs. On July 14, 2007, Wyoming was scheduled to play an Indoor Football Championship of sorts against the Fayetteville Guard. Both franchises received letters on July 7, 2007, telling them they have been kicked out of the National Indoor Football League.\n\nOn August 18, 2007, the Cavalry officially announced they would join the American Indoor Football Association as a flagship team of the league's new Western Division. On July 26, 2009, the Cavalry hosted the Reading Express in AIFA Bowl III and were defeated 65-42. On July 25, 2010, the Cavalry traveled to Baltimore to take on the Mariners in AIFA Bowl IV and would go on to lose 57-42. As of the end of the 2010 season, the Cavalry are 0-5 in championship games.\nOn September 1, 2010, the Cavalry announced they would be joining the Indoor Football League as an expansion member for the 2011 season.\n\nFor the 2013 season, its third in the IFL, the Cavalry hired rookie head coach Ryan Lingenfelder to replace longtime head coach Dan \"Majic\" Maciejczak. Lingenfelder, a former AFL player, served as defensive coordinator of the Tri-Cities Fever for the previous three seasons. Shortly before the 2013 season began, the owner of the Cheyenne Warriors died and the IFL revised its schedule to accommodate the now 9-team league. The Cavalry had been scheduled to play two games against the projected in-state rival. Barney O'Donnell III joined the team as the new starting quarterback. After compiling a 2-24 record in 2 seasons, Lingenfelder was relieved of his coaching duties.\n\n!Totals || 105 || 109 || 0\n\nThe following is a list of all Cavalry players who have won league Awards\n\nThe following Cavalry players have been named to All-IFL Teams:\n\n\"Note: Statistics are correct through the end of the 2014 Indoor Football League season.\"\n"}

{"id": "1956793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956793", "title": "Safdar Hashmi", "text": "Safdar Hashmi\n\nSafdar Hashmi (12 April 1954 – 2 January 1989) was a communist playwright and director, best known for his work with street theatre in India. He was also an actor, lyricist, and theorist, and he is still considered an important voice in Indian political theatre. He was an activist of the Students' Federation of India (SFI).\n\nHe was a founding member of \"Jana Natya Manch\" (People's Theatre Front; JANAM for short) in 1973, which grew out of the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). He was murdered in 1989 in Jhandapur, while performing a street play, \"Halla Bol\".\n\nSafdar Hashmi was born on 12 April 1954 in Delhi, to Haneef and Qamar Azad Hashmi. He spent the early part of his life in Delhi and Aligarh, where he grew up in a liberal Marxist environment, and went on to complete his schooling in Delhi. Actress Saba Azad is his niece.\n\nHashmi graduated from St. Stephen's College, Delhi with a degree in English Literature, and went on to complete his M.A. in English from Delhi University. During this period, he became associated with the cultural unit of the Students' Federation of India, the student wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and eventually with the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). In the years before and after his graduation, he worked on several plays with IPTA, such as \"Kimlesh\", and \"Dekhte Lena\".\n\nHashmi co-founded the \"Jana Natya Manch\" (People's Theatre Front), with the acronym JANAM (\"birth\" in Hindi), in 1973. JANAM grew out of the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) and was associated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), with which he was actively involved in the 1970s. When Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was accused of rigging the elections, he produced a street play, \"Kursi, Kursi, Kursi\" (\"Chair, Chair, Chair\"), as a reaction to the controversy. The play narrates the story of a king whose throne moves with him when he attempts to give it up in favour of an elected representative. The play was performed every day for a week, at the Boat Club Lawns in New Delhi, then a hub of political activity. It proved to be a turning point for JANAM.\n\nUntil 1975, JANAM performed open-air proscenium and street plays for mass audiences. When Indira Gandhi imposed a state of emergency and made political theatre difficult, Hashmi began to work as a lecturer in English literature in universities in Garhwal, Kashmir, and Delhi.\n\nWhen the Emergency ended in 1977, he returned to political activism, and in 1978, JANAM took to street theatre in a big way with \"Machine\", which was performed for a trade union meeting of over 200,000 workers on 20 November 1978. This was followed by plays on the distress of small peasants (\"Gaon Se Shahar Tak\"), on clerical fascism (\"Hatyare & Apharan Bhaichare Ke\"), on unemployment (\"Teen Crore\"), on violence against women (\"Aurat\") and on inflation (\"DTC ki Dhandhli\"). Hashmi also produced several documentaries and a TV serial for Doordarshan, including \"Khilti Kaliyan\" (\"Flowers in Bloom\"), which examined rural empowerment. He also wrote books for children and criticism of the Indian stage.\n\nHashmi was the de facto director of JANAM, and prior to his death, it gave about 4,000 performances of 24 street plays, mostly in working-class neighbourhoods, factories and workshops.\n\nHashmi was a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the largest communist party in India. In 1979, he married his comrade and theatre actress, Moloyshree. Later, he worked for the Press Trust of India (PTI) and \"The Economic Times\" as a journalist, and then became Press Information Officer of the Government of West Bengal in Delhi. In 1984, he gave up his job and devoted himself full-time to political activism.\n\nHashmi’s output includes two proscenium plays – an adaptation of Maxim Gorky’s \"Enemies\" (1983) and \"Moteram ka Satyagraha\" (with Habib Tanvir, 1988) – many songs, a television series script, poems and plays for children, and documentary films. While committed to radical, popular, and left-wing art, Hashmi refrained from clichéd portrayals, and was not afraid of formal experimentation.\n\nOn 1 January 1989, the JANAM troupe began a performance of the street play \"Halla Bol\" (\"Raise Your Voice!\"), during the Ghaziabad municipal elections in Sahibabad's Jhandapur village (near Delhi). During the performance, the troupe was attacked by political hoodlums of the Indian National Congress. Hashmi was fatally injured and died the following day. On 4 January 1989, two days after his death, his wife Moloyshree Hashmi went to the same spot again with the JANAM troupe, and defiantly completed the play.\n\nFourteen years after the incident, a Ghaziabad court convicted ten people, including Congress Party member Mukesh Sharma, for the murder.\n\nHashmi has become a symbol of cultural resistance against authoritarianism for the Indian left. JANAM continues its theatre work, and on 12 April 2012, Hashmi's birthday, the group inaugurated Studio Safdar, a performance and workshop space located in Shadi Khampur, near Patel Nagar in Central Delhi. The space is next door to a left-wing cafe and bookstore, May Day. The writer Bhisham Sahni, along with many other artists, founded the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (SAHMAT) in February 1989, as an open platform for politically and socially conscious artists. Hashmi's writings were later collected in \"The Right to Perform: Selected Writings of Safdar Hashmi\" (New Delhi, 1989).\n\nEach year on 1 January, the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Day is observed as a \"Day of Resolve\" by SAHMAT, and a daylong cultural congregation, \"Jashn-e-Daura\", is organised in New Delhi. The day is also commemorated by JANAM, which organises street plays at Jhandapur village, in Sahibabad, where he was killed. In 1998, Safdar Hashmi Natyasangham was formed in Kozhikode, Kerala, which provides free training to economically backward students.\n\nThe 2003 film \"Anbe Sivam\", made by Sundar C., and the 2008 film \"Halla Bol\", made by Rajkumar Santoshi, were inspired by his life. The latter also depicts a scene where a street theatre activist is beaten by men hired by a political party, an incident which turns into a catalyst for a public uprising.\n\nIn 1989, the painter M.F. Husain had a painting \"Tribute to Hashmi\" sold at auction for over $1 million, the first time a painting by an Indian artist reached this valuation.\n\nThe 2020 book \"Halla Bol: The Death and Life of Safdar Hashmi\" by Sudhanva Deshpande recounts the events leading up to the attack on Jana Natya Manch's performance of the play \"Halla Bol\" in Jhandapur on January 1, 1989, in which Safdar sustained fatal injuries. It also discusses Safdar's work in Jana Natya Manch.\n\nThe Institute for Research and Documentation in Social Sciences (IRDS), a non-governmental organisation from Lucknow, has been awarding the Safdar Hashmi Award for Human Rights in reverence to his contributions to the cause of human rights.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1956802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956802", "title": "Michael Howlett", "text": "Michael Howlett\n\nMichael J. Howlett Sr. (August 30, 1914 – May 4, 1992) was a Democratic politician from the U.S. state of Illinois, who was elected several times to statewide office.\n\nHowlett was born in Chicago, a son of Irish immigrants. As a youth, Howlett was All-American water polo player, participating on ten championship teams of the Illinois Athletic Club. He graduated from St. Mel High School and briefly attended DePaul University, leaving the latter in 1934 to become a state bank examiner. Subsequently, he founded his own insurance business, served as Chicago-area director of the National Youth Administration, was an executive for the Chicago Park District, was appointed regional director of the U.S. Office of Price Stabilization, and was a steel company executive. He was also a U.S. Navy veteran of World War II.\n\nIn 1956, Howlett ran for Illinois Auditor and is credited with exposing embezzlement by incumbent Auditor Orville Hodge of more than $1.5 million in state funds. Hodge resigned and eventually went to prison, but Howlett lost the general election to Elbert Sidney Smith as part of a national Republican landslide. However, in the next general election, in 1960, Howlett \"was\" elected Auditor of Public Accounts (the Auditor's Office was the predecessor to the current office of Comptroller), and was re-elected twice. During Howlett's first term as Auditor, he cut the budget of the office by one-fifth, and returned over $600,000 to the state treasury. In 1972, Howlett was elected Illinois Secretary of State, becoming the first Democratic state officer to win four consecutive statewide elections.\n\nHowlett was prepared to run for re-election in 1976, but was encouraged by Cook County Democrats to challenge incumbent Governor Dan Walker for the Democratic nomination in 1976. Howlett defeated Walker in the March primary, and stood as the Democratic nominee for governor of Illinois in the general election, whereupon he was defeated by Republican nominee James R. Thompson.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Howlett was dogged by conflict of interest charges, first raised by Walker, over payments Howlett received as an executive at Sun Steel Company. A report issued by former Illinois Supreme Court Justice Marvin Burt at the behest of Republican state Attorney General William J. Scott was highly critical of Howlett. However, a Cook County judge ruled no conflict of interest had arisen, and cleared Howlett. Thompson, who successfully prosecuted former Illinois governor Otto Kerner Jr., continued to hammer the issue during the general election campaign, and attacked Howlett as corrupt, and Attorney General Scott vowed to appeal the judge's ruling. Ironically, it was Scott who later was forced to resign after a felony conviction.\n\nEarly polls of the contest had Howlett in the lead, although Thompson had nearly closed the gap by the time of the primary. However, Walker's attacks during the bitter primary weakened Howlett, and by August, Thompson held a slim lead in the polls. His lead expanded during the campaign, and Howlett ended up losing by 30 percentage points (nearly 1.4 million votes), the widest margin of defeat for any Democratic Nominee for Governor of Illinois in history. Thompson was the first candidate for Governor to receive over 3 million votes, and his tally of 3,000,395 remains the highest number of votes ever cast for a candidate in an election for Governor of Illinois.\n\nAfter his loss in the 1976 governor's race, Howlett opened a private consulting business.\n\nHowlett would later see his son run for statewide office through bizarre circumstances. In the 1986 Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor, former U.S. Senator Adlai Stevenson III and the Democratic Party selected State senator George E. Sangmeister as the party-preferred candidate, however he narrowly lost the primary to Mark Fairchild (a Lyndon LaRouche activist). After LaRouche followers had won the Democratic nominations for both Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State, Stevenson refused to run as the Democratic standard-bearer, and formed the Solidarity Party. When Sangmeister was unwilling to run with Stevenson in the fall, Howlett's son Michael J. Howlett Jr., then a Cook County judge, was nominated by the Solidarity Party. Stevenson-Howlett went down to defeat in the fall, with only 40% of the vote. Another son, Edward G. Howlett, was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for Chicago City Clerk in 1995.\n\nHowlett died in Chicago's Mercy Hospital of chronic kidney failure. He had suffered a stroke three months earlier and remained hospitalized from then until his death.\n\nThe building housing the offices of the Illinois Secretary of State in Springfield, Illinois, formerly known as the Centennial Building, is named after Michael J.Howlett.\n\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |Year\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |Office\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |Election\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |Subject\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |Party\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |Votes\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |%\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |Opponent\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |Party\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |Votes\n!bgcolor=#cccccc |%\n\n"}

The French Press can also be used for disintegration of chloroplasts, homogenates of animal tissue, and other biological particles. It is capable of disrupting cell walls while leaving the cell nucleus undisturbed. The French press was invented by Charles Stacy French of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.\nThe press uses an external hydraulic pump to drive a piston within a larger cylinder that contains the liquid sample. The highly pressurized sample is then squeezed past a needle valve. As the sample passes through the valve, the fluid experiences shear stress and decompression, causing cellular disruption. The major components of a French press are made of stainless steel to prevent sample contamination.\n\nA French press is commonly used to break the resilient plasma membrane and cell walls of bacteria and other microorganisms for isolation of proteins and other cellular components. The disruption of cells in a French press generates 'inside-out' membrane vesicles which are required for many \"in vitro\" biochemical assays. The cell is typically chilled overnight before use to preserve enzymatic activities. \n\nDisadvantages of the press include that it is not well suited for processing large sample volumes, and is somewhat difficult to operate as a result of the large weight of the assembly (about 14 kg). Another disadvantage is that the input cell volume must be free of large cell clumps, which requires a pre-processing step (typically, by sonication). If cell clumps are not removed prior to processing, clogging of the valve occurs, and the unit must be cleaned thoroughly before the processing can continue. As a result, many protein purification labs find that the use of lysozyme and sonication is sufficient for routine bacterial protein expression.\n\nOther technologies, such as sonication and ball mills, are available for many of the same purposes, and have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, sonication can generate high shear forces that break cellular DNA into small fragments. With a French press, the shear force can be carefully modulated by adjusting the piston pressure. The Press provides a single pass through the point of maximum shear force, limiting damage to delicate biological structures due to repeated shear, as occurs in other disruption methods.\n"}
{"id": "1956809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956809", "title": "Nigel Dennis", "text": "Nigel Dennis\n\nNigel Forbes Dennis (16 January 1912 – 19 July 1989) was an English writer, critic, playwright and magazine editor.\n\nBorn at his grandfather's house in Surrey, England, Dennis was the son of Lt.-Col. Michael Frederic Beauchamp Dennis, DSO, of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, who came of an old Devonshire family, and Louise, née Bosanquet, whose ancestors were bankers of Huguenot origin. (Louise's cousin, the bowler B.J.T. Bosanquet, invented the \"googly\", or \"Bosie\", as it is sometimes known. (\"Letters to The Times\" May 1963). The family moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and after his father's death in action in 1918, his mother married Fitzroy Griffin. Dennis attended school in Rhodesia. At fifteen, he joined his uncle, Ernan Forbes Dennis, a British diplomat working in Vienna as Passport Control Officer (a cover for his real role as MI6 Head of Station with responsibility for Austria, Hungary and Yugoslavia), and his wife, Phyllis Bottome, the novelist. Dennis's further education was completed at the Odenwaldschule in Germany, a progressive co-educational establishment, after which he returned to England. He remained there for four years before settling in the United States in 1934 where he worked as a journalist.\n\nDennis was married twice, firstly to Marie-Madeleine Massias, from Charente-Maritime, France. They had two daughters, Frederica Freer and Michie Herbert, a sculptor. His second marriage was to the actress, Beatrice Ann Hewart Matthew. He spent his last years in Malta and died in Gloucestershire in July 1989.\n\nDennis held jobs at the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, a censorship body; \"The New Republic\", a progressive political journal; and \"Time\". His job at \"Time\" returned him to Britain in 1950 (or 1949). Easing into novel writing, in 1949 he published his first acknowledged novel, \"Boys and Girls Come out to Play\" (\"A Sea Change\" in the USA), which won the Anglo-American novel award for that year (shared with Anthony West). It starts semi-autobiographically, with a depiction of a young man having an epileptic fit, a condition Dennis suffered from all his life. Later in 1955, Dennis published his most notable work, \"Cards of Identity\", a witty psychological satire that gained cult acclaim. The novel was converted into a play the following year. Members of the Identity Club gather at an English country house to listen to papers discussing interesting case histories of various identity problems. The novel details many of the problems England experienced in the late forties and early fifties. His third novel, \"A House in Order\" also deals with the question of identity but it is more personal rather than social as it portrays how a prisoner keeps his mind in order during his imprisonment. Dennis's career involved a mixture of non-fiction, novel, criticism, and play-writing. His book reviews appeared in the \"Sunday Telegraph\" for twenty years, starting (with the newspaper itself) in 1961. He became a contributor to \"Encounter\" in 1963 and was eventually appointed its co-editor before terminating his relationship with the magazine in 1970.\n\nDennis's books were few but distinguished. His other works include \"Two Plays and a Preface\" (1958), \"Dramatic Essays\" (1962) and the novel \"A House in Order\" (1966). A short study of Jonathan Swift won the Royal Society of Literature Award under the W. H. Heinemann bequest in 1966; this was followed by \"Exotics: Poems of the Mediterranean and Middle East\" (1970) and his last book, \"An Essay on Malta\" (1972), with illustrations by Osbert Lancaster.\n\nThree of his plays were put on at the Royal Court theatre: \"Cards of Identity\" (1956), \"The Making of Moo\" (1957) and \"August for the People\" (1961). The first London revival of \"The Making of Moo\" was staged at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, London, in November 2009.\n\nAccording to a letter published in \"The Guardian\" in May 2008: \"In the 1930s, Dennis wrote \"Chalk and Cheese; a co-educational school novel\" under the pseudonym Richard Vaughan. Legend has it that, before publication, every copy was destroyed in an air raid on a warehouse.\" In fact the novel, which was largely autobiographical, was published in 1934 and reviewed by the \"Times Literary Supplement\", among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The label is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nIn general, goods imported into the United States must have a country of origin label unless excepted, but goods manufactured in the United States can be sold with no origin label unless explicitly required. U.S.-made goods that must bear an origin label include automobiles, textiles, wool, and fur products. Any voluntary claims about the amount of U.S. content in other products must comply with the FTC's Made in USA policy.\n\nA Made in USA claim can be expressed (for example, \"American-made\") or implied. In identifying implied claims, the Commission focuses on the overall impression of the advertising, label, or promotional material. Depending on the context, U.S. symbols or geographic references (for example, U.S. flags, outlines of U.S. maps, or references to U.S. locations of headquarters or factories) may convey a claim of U.S. origin either by themselves or in conjunction with other phrases or images.\n\nIn May 1997, the FTC published its proposal that the requirement be stated as:\n\nHowever, this was just a proposal and never became part of the final guidelines published in the Federal Register in 1997.\n\nOn July 4, 2013, House Representative Steve Israel announced legislation that would require all U.S. national parks to sell merchandise that is made in the USA.\nA product that includes foreign components may be called \"Assembled in USA\" without qualification when its principal assembly takes place in the U.S. and the assembly is substantial. For the \"assembly\" claim to be valid, the product's \"last substantial transformation\" also should have occurred in the U.S.. A \"screwdriver\" assembly in the U.S. of foreign components into a final product at the end of the manufacturing process does not usually qualify for the \"Assembled in USA\" claim.\n\nCountry of origin labels are required on textiles, wools, furs, automobiles, most foods, and many other imports.\n\nExamples of fraudulent practices involving imports include removing a required foreign origin label before the product is even delivered to the ultimate purchaser (with or without the improper substitution of a Made in USA label) and failing to label a product with the required country of origin.\n\nA rumour spread that products made in a town named \"Usa, Ōita\" located in Ōita Prefecture, Japan and exported to the US in the 1960s carried the label \"MADE IN USA, JAPAN\", to create the appearance that the product was made in the US. It is, however, a myth that Japan renamed the town \"Usa\" following World War II so that goods exported from Japan could be labeled as such. The town has existed from the 8th century (see Usa Jingū), predating the existence of the \"United States of America\" (first used in the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence) by more than a millennium, and is not a major manufacturing center; furthermore, the United States Customs Service would probably have recognized such labeling, had it occurred, as fraudulent and thus would have prohibited goods so labeled from being imported into the United States.\n\nMany manufacturers use the Made in the U.S.A. label as a selling point with varying degrees of success. This tag is associated with marketing and operational benefits, such as more appeal to certain buyers and lower shipping costs. When an American consumer sees a product is made in the U.S., they may perceive it as higher quality than a Chinese-made version, for example. The decision where to produce is based on many factors, not simply direct product costs. Marketing and operations are both affected greatly by producing domestically.\n\nMany companies highlight the fact a product is made in the U.S. with their branding and marketing campaigns, benefitting from the huge marketing potential, often affecting the success of a product. Country of origin is a typical heuristic used when purchasing, playing a significant role in consumer perception and evaluation since some consumers believe domestic products offer higher value and less risk.\n\nFor years American car brands have used this as a differentiating point. Supporting companies such as Ford was thought of as patriotic. Twenty-eight percent of Americans have said they would only buy American vehicles. There was a large push from domestic automakers after foreign competition entered the market in the 1980s. Ford placed ads to all Americans highlighting that they made quality cars. Chrysler also needed to reclaim market share from foreign competitors. They created commercials about American cars that were made by Americans with American parts. In recent years, the trend has changed as Cars.com' 2016 American-Made Index for that year showed that many Hondas and Toyotas are among the top \"American-made\" automobiles.\n\nDue to concerns about the exploitation of non-American workers in sweatshops, products bearing a Made in the USA label can appeal to American consumers seeking high-quality products produced domestically under American labor and environmental laws. Until it shut down brick and mortar stores in 2017, American Apparel, which had been producing in Los Angeles since 1989, was the largest garment manufacturer in North America. The company's CEO was committed to social responsibility, and offered factory workers careers with benefits and pay significantly higher than that of their overseas counterparts. When they shuttered, 2,400 employees were left unemployed. After being purchased by Gildan Activewear, American Apparel returned as an online-only retailer with most of its apparel sourced from factories in Central America, primarily Honduras and Nicaragua. Los Angeles Apparel, the new manufacturer, designer and distributor led by Dov Charney, the former CEO of American Apparel, hired back 350, 200 employees were hired by Broncs Inc., and Zack Hurley, CEO of Indie Source committed to hiring \"at least a few dozen.\"\n\nAfter worker protests and bribery investigations, Walmart, the largest grocery store in the world, has pledged to source $50 billion in products from the US over the next ten years. Companies such as Tropicana sold their orange juice as being 100% native to Florida. In the late 2000s decade, they started to mix oranges from Brazil, and Florida's Natural saw this as an opportunity to place \"Made in the USA\" on their cartons. After Tropicana returned to only using Florida oranges several years later, Florida's Natural updated their ads saying \"All Florida. Never imported. Who can say that?\"\n\nCompanies that make products in the US also see benefits in their supply chain. Not all benefits are directly seen in cash flows immediately. Aspects like communication are simply improved, which may have effects that are not seen in the short run. The trend towards overseas factories has resulted in complications for companies of all sizes, ranging from quality to timeline issues. \n\nSome direct costs are decreased as a result of using domestic factories. Shipping is simpler and faster when there is no need to deal with customs. US factories offer more flexible production runs, which can be appealing to new companies or new products. These offer prices and quantities closer to what companies require. Research shows that reduced tariff rates are reflected immediately in lower clothing prices. This suggests that the price of an imported good directly includes the tariff paid to import it. By producing in the US, this price increase is avoided.\n\nCompanies also benefit from non-direct cost ways of making in the US. The US has the most productive workforce. Costs are higher for these factories but the workers are more effective than their abroad counterparts. China historically was a cheap place to manufacture. This led to the thriving apparel factories. As currency appreciates, and wages rise people are moving to low-cost areas in south-east Asia, and also coming back to the US. China's prices are rising and time to market is becoming increasingly important. Communication is difficult as well for companies that produce in areas where another language is spoken. The general manager of a Haier plant in Camden, South Carolina Bernie Tymkiw has been quoted saying, “We just don't have the brainstorming ability because of language.” The cultural disconnect can prove to be a significant barrier with global companies.\n\nSupply chains are more agile using local suppliers. There is a greater control over orders. High-end designers like being very close to their factories, as they have full control of the product quality that is leaving the assembly line. This is necessary to keep their high standards. One can visit their factory as often as necessary. This plays an important role in auditing the production process. An online article about the luxury apparel maker company Everlane led to over 2,000 shirts sales in a single day. A shirt restock from China may have taken three months, whereas they were able to do it in under one month. Being closer to the factory can aid in shipping costs and time.\n\nAccording to the FTC, Made in USA means that “all or virtually all” the product has been made in the United States of America. The product should contain only negligible foreign content. The FTC Enforcement Policy Statement on U.S. Origin Claims says there is no single \"bright line\" determining what \"all or substantially all\" means. The minimum requirement is that the final assembly or processing of the product must take place within the United States. Examples are given on the FTC site; a barbecue grill made of components made in the US with the exception of the knobs may be called \"Made in USA\" while a garden tool with an imported motor may not.\n\nIn March 2020, the FTC announced a settlement with Williams-Sonoma, Inc. over false advertising claims where Goldtouch Bakeware products, Rejuvenation-branded products, and Pottery Barn Teen and Pottery Barn Kids-branded upholstered furniture products were falsely advertised as Made in the USA. As part of the settlement with the FTC, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. agreed to stop making false, misleading, or unsubstantiated ‘Made in the USA’ claims and is required to pay $1 million to the FTC.\n\nIn June 2016, the FTC ordered Shinola Detroit to stop using \"Where American is Made\" as a slogan as \"100% of the cost of materials used to make certain watches is attributable to imported materials.\" Today, the Ronda movements are made in Bangkok, Thailand. The dials, hands, cases, crystals, and buckles are manufactured in Guangdong, China.\n\n\n"}

It received heavy airplay on modern rock stations and considerably expanded their audience (along with the album itself).\n\n\"Teen Age Riot\" is one of Sonic Youth's most recognizable songs, yet it is something of an oddity amongst their repertoire, consisting of a traditional verse-chorus pop song structure.\n\nThe song was included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and is an on-disc track in \"Rock Band 2\".\n\nThe song is about an alternate reality where J Mascis is president of the United States. In the liner notes accompanying the deluxe edition of \"Daydream Nation\", Byron Coley quoted Thurston Moore on \"Teen Age Riot\": \"It was actually about appointing J Mascis as our \"de facto\" alternative dream president\".\n\nThe album version of the song has two distinct parts. The intro section features a repeating, hypnotic guitar melody, and Kim Gordon reciting in a stream-of-consciousness manner such utterances as \"You're it, no you're it / Say it, don't spray it / Miss me, don't dismiss me / Spirit desire / We will fall.\" (\"We Will Fall\" is a reference to the Stooges' song of the same name from their debut eponymous album). After 80 seconds, all instruments stop, and Moore breaks through the fading instruments with a fast, distorted, noisy guitar riff, opening the main section of the song. The riff leads to the dynamic guitar melody that plays throughout the rest of the song with the vocal melody, sung by Moore. The riff that opens the section is repeated once again afterwards in the song, with all of the instruments accompanying it in an interlude that leads to the song's last few lines.\n\nAs with many Sonic Youth songs, the guitars were unconventionally tuned; in this case, Moore's pentatonic tuning was (reading from left to right, the lowest-pitched string to the highest-pitched string) GABDEG and Lee Ranaldo's tuning was GGDDGG, as published in a \"Guitar World\" interview with the band.\n\nSome live performances of \"Teen Age Riot\" omitted the opening section sung by Gordon, notably the live version recorded and released with the deluxe edition of \"Daydream Nation\". The opening section was also cut from the song's music video.\n\nThe video for the song was Sonic Youth's fourth overall, excluding the low-budget Ciccone Youth videos; the band directed it themselves. It included clips of many icons of alternative music culture such as Mascis, Mark E. Smith, Johnny Thunders, Neil Young, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, Sun Ra, D. Boon, Mike Watt, Ian MacKaye, Henry Rollins, Nick Cave, Tom Waits, Blixa Bargeld and Kiss.Includes to comic book writer Harvey Pekar (American Splendor)\n\n\n\nColey, Byron and Farell, Ray; Liner Notes, Daydream Nation, 'deluxe edition', copyright 2007 Geffen Records. \n"}

In 1972, despite a relatively high draft number of 363, he volunteered for the Vietnam War, where he served as a US Army military policeman until 1973. He also served as an MP in Aurora, Colorado at the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, then in Thailand with the 281st MPs at Amphoe Sattahip/Vayama, and in South Korea with the 110th MPs at Daejeon. In 1975, he left with an honorable military discharge and the rank of sergeant.\n\nHe returned to Colorado where he became a state trooper in north metro Denver and subsequently a city cop in suburban Thornton, Colorado. During his ten years as a police officer, he worked a variety of assignments, yet none stayed with him as much as his tour of duty in Vietnam.\n\nCain's experiences in Vietnam inspired him to write a non-fiction manuscript entitled \"Saigon Alley\". After nearly every publisher in New York City rejected the proposed book, Zebra Books' Michael Seidman (coincidentally also an ex-MP) offered Cain a four book contract, but only if he would fictionalize his manuscript and increase the sex and violence. This ultimately became the cult classic \"Saigon Commandos\" series, which, beginning in 1983, ran to 12 books. Book 9 of this series was made into a film, called \"Saigon Commandos\" by Roger Corman's Concorde Studios.\n\nCain went on to write the \"War Dogs\" series for Zebra, using the pseudonym Nik Uhernik. He then wrote the first eight books in Ballantine Books' \"Chopper-1\" series, under the pseudonym Jack Hawkins. He also penned three books in the Able Team series, which was a spin-off of the immensely popular Mack Bolan Exceutioner novels.\n\nHe wrote the final installment in the \"Vietnam Ground Zero\" series, (published as \"Zebra Cube\" in the \"Heroes\" trilogy), using the pseudonym Robert Baxter. then created and wrote the six-book series \"Little Saigon\" (only four books of which were published by Lynx Books of New York before Lynx folded).\n\nAfter writing over 30 books, Cain pulled the plug on his word processor in 1990 and became a private investigator in Los Angeles.

It tells a non-canon alternate version of each film in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy in which a point of divergence occurs and changes the outcome of the story. Each individual \"Infinities\" story is unrelated to the others and is set within the timeline of their original film.\n\nStar Wars Infinities: A New Hope is a 2002 three-part story arc in the \"Star Wars Infinities\" series of comic books. It is an extended alternate ending of the 1977 film \"Star Wars\" in which Luke Skywalker's proton torpedoes fail to destroy the Death Star.\n\nAt the Battle of Yavin, events begin to change when the torpedoes fired by Luke Skywalker experience a technical malfunction and fail to destroy the Death Star, but prevent the complete destruction of Yavin 4. Unable to fire a fully charged shot from the Death Star's superlaser, Grand Moff Tarkin orders the technicians to fire at reduced power, nearly levelling the Massassi Temple on the moon's surface.\n\nThe Imperials send out a wing of TIE Fighters to pick off the remaining members of Red Squadron. Luke, driven to near-insanity by the failure of the mission and the apparent destruction of Rebel base, turns his fighter to face the TIEs alone. Eventually, Han Solo convinces Luke to flee and the \"Millennium Falcon\" jumps into hyperspace with Luke's X-Wing on its tail.\n\nThe Rebel forces attempt to flee the Yavin system, but are captured by the Imperials. The Rebel leaders are imprisoned on the Death Star to await execution, but Princess Leia is taken to Coruscant, where she is put under house arrest at the Emperor's residence, the great former Jedi Temple. Once there, Darth Vader subtly begins Leia's conversion to the dark side of the Force.\n\nAfter the \"Falcon\" drops out of hyperspace, Luke and Han argue and Luke accuses Han of having abandoned the Rebellion. Luke pulls out his lightsaber and threatens to kill Han. Obi-Wan Kenobi's ghost then appears and tells Luke that he is moving into the dark side. Obi-Wan then instructs Luke to travel to Dagobah and seek out the Jedi Master Yoda. Han takes Luke to Dagobah, where he begins his training under Yoda's tutelage. Han then leaves with Chewbacca to finish the repairs on the \"Falcon\". While on Dagobah, Luke enters a mysterious cave as part of his training. There, he fights and kills a vision of Darth Vader and is shocked to find Leia's face under the helmet.\n\nFive years later, the Empire celebrates the fifth anniversary of the Rebellion's defeat by renaming the Death Star the \"Justice Star\", which then eclipses over the sun as a sign of everlasting peace. Now trained in the ways of the Sith, Leia convinces the Emperor to reinstate the Imperial Senate. Han and Chewbacca watch coverage of the celebrations in a bar on Ord Mantell and then board the \"Falcon\" and head back to Dagobah.\n\nOn Dagobah, Luke's training is nearing completion. The last test is for Luke to re-enter the cave. Luke is again confronted by a vision of Vader but is now able to overcome his fears and completely connect to the Force. Han arrives soon after and informs Luke of Leia's whereabouts. Yoda then reveals to Luke the truth that Leia is really his sister and that Vader is their father.\n\nLuke, Yoda, Han, Chewbacca and R2-D2 then take on in the \"Falcon\" to Coruscant. Once there, the \"Falcon\" lands on the Justice Star where Yoda and R2 debark. Yoda confronts Tarkin, now an admiral, and takes control of him with a Jedi mind trick.\n\nChewbacca flies the \"Falcon\" to Coruscant, where Luke and Han attempt to infiltrate the Emperor's palace. Once there, Luke and Han defeat a number of red-cloaked Imperial Guards and a reprogrammed, more aggressive C-3PO before confronting the Emperor and his two apprentices, Vader and Leia. At his master's orders, Vader turns his lightsaber over to Leia, who duels with Luke. Luke refuses to kill her and reveals to her that she is his sister. When Leia refuses to kill her brother, the Emperor tortures them both with Force lightning. Vader attacks his master to protect Luke and Leia.\n\nLuke, Leia, Han and 3PO then escape to the \"Falcon\" as the Emperor turns on Vader and kills him. Yoda, using R2 to control the Justice Star's orbit, contacts the Emperor and announces that he is coming to see him and will be there soon. The Justice Star crashes into Coruscant, destroying both the planet and the battle station and killing Yoda, Tarkin and the Emperor.\n\nLater, R2's memory is inserted into an identical body. The story ends with Luke and Leia being visited by the ghosts of Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker during the inaugural celebration of the first Chancellor of the New Republic, Leia, on the planet Naboo.\n\nStar Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back is a 2003 three-part story arc in the \"Star Wars Infinities\" series of comic books. It is an alternate telling of the 1980 film \"The Empire Strikes Back\" in which Luke Skywalker freezes to death during the blizzard on Hoth. The comic is not a direct sequel to \"Star Wars Infinities: A New Hope\", but rather a sequel to the events after the actual film version of \"A New Hope\".\n\nThree years after the Rebel's success at the Battle of Yavin, the Alliance sets up a new base on the remote ice world of Hoth. After escaping from a Wampa ice monster, Luke sees the spirit of Obi-Wan instructing him to go to Dagobah and find the Jedi Master Yoda. Events begin to change when Han's Tauntaun dies before Han can find the missing Luke. Unable to find Luke in time and with no way to keep him warm, Han is unable to save Luke from death by exposure. But before Luke's death, the young Jedi imparts Obi-Wan's message to Han.\n\nLater, during the funeral for Luke, Han tells Leia that he has to go to Dagobah, believing that he is to train as Jedi. Just then, the Empire attacks and the Rebellion starts to evacuate Hoth. The \"Millennium Falcon\", unable to effectively escape the Hoth System due to a malfunctioning hyperdrive, sets a course for Bespin, where Han hopes he can get repairs to the ship. Unbeknownst to Han, Darth Vader has hired a number of bounty hunters to follow the \"Falcon\", including Boba Fett, who follows the \"Falcon\" to Bespin.\n\nUpon his arrival at Bespin, Han meets up with his gambling buddy Lando Calrissian. Casually laughing off Han's claim that he's going to become a Jedi, Lando agrees to repair the \"Falcon's\" hyperdrive. When Lando returns to his office, he finds Boba Fett sitting at his desk, demanding that Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO be turned over to him, but what Boba does not know is that they have already arrived (as Han decided not to go into the asteroid field). Fett is led into a trap by Lando and is knocked unconscious after grappling with Han and Chewbacca.\n\nAfter the repairs are finished and the \"Falcon\" leaves Bespin, Lando returns to his office to admire his new desk, which is crafted using Boba Fett's carbonite-encased corpse. However, Vader's ship arrives soon after the \"Falcon\" leaves and demands that Lando turn over the Rebels to him. Upon learning that the \"Falcon\" has already left, Vader orders the devastating bombardment of Cloud City, killing every inhabitant.\n\nEventually, the \"Falcon\" arrives at Dagobah where Han is surprised that he is not to be trained as a Jedi, but Leia is instead. Yoda tells Leia that Luke was her brother and her father is Darth Vader. Han, determined to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt, leaves Leia on Dagobah to train with Yoda.\n\nDuring the next several months, Han gathers together the money he needs to pay off Jabba, Leia trains with great fervor, and Darth Vader continues his search for Luke, not knowing the youth's fate; dismissing rumors that Luke has died, Vader insists that he can still sense Luke's presence.\n\nEventually, Han, Chewbacca, and C-3PO return to Tatooine to settle Han's debt, but upon their arrival, they are captured by Jabba's thugs and the \"Falcon\" is stolen by a bounty hunter. Han and Chewbacca are taken to Jabba's palace where they are forced to do battle with two nexu that Jabba keeps in a pit beneath his audience chamber, where the rancor used to be. Han and Chewbacca are able to escape with R2's help, and the now freed nexu tear through Jabba's palace, destroying everything in sight. In the confusion, Han and Chewbacca are able to board a Hutt shuttlecraft and escape to the docked \"Falcon\" in Mos Eisley.\n\nSoon after Han's escape, Vader arrives at Jabba's palace to question him about Han's presence. Jabba says that he does not know where Han is now. Vader recognises C-3PO and demands that his former creation be handed over to him. After returning to his ship, Vader dismantles 3PO and retrieves Dagobah's location from the droid's memory.\n\nBack on Dagobah, Leia is in the last stages of her training. Yoda sends her on a mission to find a crystal for her lightsaber from a nearby cave. During Leia's absence, Vader arrives and confronts Yoda. Using his connection to the Force, Yoda delves deep into Vader's psyche and confronts the man inside, Anakin Skywalker, who is surrounded by multiple layers of the dark side of the Force. During the mental battle, Leia finds her crystal and receives an image of Vader confronting Yoda. In his mind, Anakin fights off shadows of long-deceased Jedi such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu and Qui-Gon Jinn. During the confrontation, Vader learns of Luke's death. Vader is then able to deliver a fatal blow to Yoda through the mental link, severing the Jedi's lock on his mind.\n\nLeia then arrives and duels with Vader. Vader offers her the chance to join him and rule the galaxy, but Leia refuses. Before Vader can strike her down, Han and Chewbacca arrive in the \"Falcon\". Han then fires on Vader and kills him. Before Yoda dies, he tells Leia to pass what she has learned on to others. Leia burns her father's body on a funeral pyre before leaving with Han on the \"Falcon\" to rejoin the Rebels and save the galaxy.\n\nStar Wars Infinities: Return of the Jedi is a 2004 three-part story arc in the \"Star Wars Infinities series\" of comic books. It is an alternate telling of the 1983 film \"Return of the Jedi\" in which C-3PO breaks during Leia's bounty for Chewbacca, causing there to be no translator between her and Jabba the Hutt. The comic is not a direct sequel to the previous \"Infinities\" stories, but rather a sequel to the events after the actual film versions of \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\n\nPrincess Leia, posing as a bounty hunter, infiltrates Jabba's palace in an attempt to rescue Han Solo, who has been frozen in carbonite. Events begin to change when Jabba knocks 3PO off his dais and 3PO is not able to function. With no translator, Leia is forced to reveal her identity and threatens Jabba with a thermal detonator to release Solo.\n\nDuring the melee, Leia and Chewbacca chase after Boba Fett, who escapes with Han Solo's carbonite-encased body. Leia fires on Fett but misses and hits the carbonite block's life support control panel. Leia, Chewbacca and a disguised Lando escape from Jabba's palace and reunite with Luke shortly before the thermal detonator goes off, killing everything within the palace. Luke promises Leia that he will find Han.\n\nOn Dagobah, Yoda, now on his deathbed, senses that Luke will not reach him before his death. On Tatooine, Luke is able to get a lead on Boba Fett's whereabouts. Yoda then dies on Dagobah and Luke, along with the Emperor and Vader, all sense it. The Emperor sends Vader to Dagobah to investigate.\n\nLuke then arrives on Dagobah and is greeted by Yoda's ghost. The ghost confirms Vader's claim that he is Luke's father and reveals that Leia is Luke's sister. Realizing that he has to confront Vader on his own, Luke has R2 record a message for Leia, send a message to the Rebellion and leaves Dagobah. Just then, a Star Destroyer drops out of hyperspace over Dagobah. Luke, captured by Vader, is brought to the second Death Star in orbit over Endor and is brought before the Emperor.\n\nMeanwhile, Boba Fett is holding a meeting with Imperial officials, hoping to sell them Han's carbonite block. Leia, Chewbacca and Lando track him down and interrupt the meeting, killing Fett in the skirmish. Leia and the others return to the Rebel fleet with Han's frozen body. After thawing out Han from the carbonite, Leia is informed by a medic that the damage to the life support control unit resulted in Han becoming completely blind. Lando then prepares the Falcon for an assault on the second Death Star that is scheduled to commence when the station's energy shield is destroyed by a Rebel unit on Endor's moon.\n\nBefore the fleet leaves for Endor, Leia receives Luke's message from R2, which reveals that they are twins and that Vader is their father. A second transmission reveals Luke's subsequent capture and that no rescue attempt is to be made. Leia takes the \"Slave-1\", commandeered after Fett's death and heads straight to the Death Star to rescue Luke. Han realises what has happened and asks Lando if he can accompany him and Chewbacca on the \"Falcon\".\n\nLeia arrives at the Death Star, but is soon captured and brought before the Emperor. Meanwhile, the Rebel fleet outside the Death Star engages the Imperial fleet while waiting for the ground assault team to destroy the shield generator. However, the battle between the Rebel and Imperial units on Endor disturbs the Ewoks, causing them to attack both sides.\n\nOn the Death Star, Palpatine orders Vader to kill Leia. Luke unleashes his lightsaber and duels with Vader himself. Leia attempts to intervene, but is subdued by Force Lightning from the Emperor, allowing Luke and Vader's duel to continue.\n\nHan, despite his blindness, takes Chewbacca's place in the \"Falcon's\" gunner turret after Chewbacca is injured. The \"Falcon\" flies down to Endor and destroys the shield generator, allowing the Rebel fleet in space to enter the half-completed Death Star. Lando takes the \"Falcon\" back to the Death Star to rescue Luke and Leia.\n\nLuke continues to duel Vader, revealing to him that both he and Leia are his children. Vader is stunned by the revelation, and is struck down by Luke at the cost of one of his arms. However, Vader is unable to kill his own children and surrenders, causing him to turn from the dark side of the Force and become Anakin Skywalker once again.\n\nDuring the duel, the Emperor escapes and Luke and Leia carry their wounded father to the \"Falcon\" waiting in the docking bay and escape before the Death Star explodes. Sometime later, on the Rebel flagship, Mon Mothma informs Luke that the Emperor is alive and still a threat. Anakin, a Jedi once more and now clad in a white variation of the life-support suit he wore as Vader, agrees to help the Rebels track down Palpatine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1956881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956881", "title": "Gear train", "text": "Gear train\n\nA gear train is a mechanical system formed by mounting gears on a frame so the teeth of the gears engage.\n\nGear teeth are designed to ensure the pitch circles of engaging gears roll on each other without slipping, providing a smooth transmission of rotation from one gear to the next.\n\nThe transmission of rotation between contacting toothed wheels can be traced back to the Antikythera mechanism of Greece and the south-pointing chariot of China. Illustrations by the Renaissance scientist Georgius Agricola show gear trains with cylindrical teeth. The implementation of the involute tooth yielded a standard gear design that provides a constant speed ratio.\n\nFeatures of gears and gear trains include:\n\nGear teeth are designed so the number of teeth on a gear is proportional to the radius of its pitch circle, and so the pitch circles of meshing gears roll on each other without slipping. The speed ratio for a pair of meshing gears can be computed from ratio of the radii of the pitch circles and the ratio of the number of teeth on each gear.\nThe velocity \"v\" of the point of contact on the pitch circles is the same on both gears, and is given by\nwhere input gear \"A\" with radius \"r\" and angular velocity \"ω\" meshes with output gear \"B\" with radius \"r\" and angular velocity \"ω\". Therefore,\nwhere \"N\" is the number of teeth on the input gear and \"N\" is the number of teeth on the output gear.\n\nThe mechanical advantage of a pair of meshing gears for which the input gear has \"N\" teeth and the output gear has \"N\" teeth is given by\n\nThis shows that if the output gear \"G\" has more teeth than the input gear \"G\", then the gear train \"amplifies\" the input torque. And, if the output gear has fewer teeth than the input gear, then the gear train \"reduces\" the input torque.\n\nIf the output gear of a gear train rotates more slowly than the input gear, then the gear train is called a \"speed reducer\". In this case, because the output gear must have more teeth than the input gear, the speed reducer amplifies the input torque.\n\nFor this analysis, we consider a gear train that has one degree-of-freedom, which means the angular rotation of all the gears in the gear train are defined by the angle of the input gear.\n\nThe size of the gears and the sequence in which they engage define the ratio of the angular velocity \"ω\" of the input gear to the angular velocity \"ω\" of the output gear, known as the speed ratio, or gear ratio, of the gear train. Let \"R\" be the speed ratio, then\n\nThe input torque \"T\" acting on the input gear \"G\" is transformed by the gear train into the output torque \"T\" exerted by the output gear \"G\". If we assume the gears are rigid and there are no losses in the engagement of the gear teeth, then the principle of virtual work can be used to analyze the static equilibrium of the gear train.\n\nLet the angle \"θ\" of the input gear be the generalized coordinate of the gear train, then the speed ratio \"R\" of the gear train defines the angular velocity of the output gear in terms of the input gear:\n\nThe formula for the generalized force obtained from the principle of virtual work with applied torques yields:\n\nThe \"mechanical advantage\" of the gear train is the ratio of the output torque \"T\" to the input torque \"T\", and the above equation yields:\n\nThe speed ratio of a gear train also defines its mechanical advantage. This shows that if the input gear rotates faster than the output gear, then the gear train amplifies the input torque. And if the input gear rotates slower than the output gear, the gear train reduces the input torque.\n\nThe simplest example of a gear train has two gears. The \"input gear\" (also known as drive gear) transmits power to the \"output gear\" (also known as driven gear). The input gear will typically be connected to a power source, such as a motor or engine. In such an example, the output of torque and rotational speed from the output (driven) gear depend on the ratio of the dimensions of the two gears.\n\nThe teeth on gears are designed so the gears can roll on each other smoothly (without slipping or jamming). In order for two gears to roll on each other smoothly, they must be designed so the velocity at the point of contact of the two pitch circles (represented by \"v\") is the same for each gear.\n\nMathematically, if the input gear \"G\" has the radius \"r\" and angular velocity formula_8, and meshes with output gear \"G\" of radius \"r\" and angular velocity formula_9, then:\n\nThe number of teeth on a gear is proportional to the radius of its pitch circle, which means the ratios of the gears' angular velocities, radii, and number of teeth are equal. Where \"N\" is the number of teeth on the input gear and \"N\" is the number of teeth on the output gear, the following equation is formed:\n\nThis shows that a simple gear train with two gears has the gear ratio \"R\" given by:\n\nThis equation shows that if the number of teeth on the output gear \"G\" is larger than the number of teeth on the input gear \"G\", then the input gear \"G\" must rotate faster than the output gear \"G\".\n\nA double reduction gear comprises two pairs of gears, as single reductions, in series. In the diagram, the red and blue gears give the first stage of reduction and the orange and green gears give the second stage of reduction. The total reduction is the product of the first stage of reduction and the second stage of reduction.\n\nIt is essential to have two coupled gears, of different sizes, on the intermediate layshaft. If three gears were used, the overall ratio would be simply that between the first and final gears, the intermediate gear would only act as an idler gear: it would reverse the direction of rotation, but not change the ratio.\n\nGear teeth are distributed along the circumference of the pitch circle so the thickness \"t\" of each tooth and the space between neighboring teeth are the same. The pitch \"p\" of the gear, which is the distance between equivalent points on neighboring teeth along the pitch circle, is equal to twice the thickness of a tooth,\n\nThe pitch of a gear \"G\" can be computed from the number of teeth \"N\" and the radius \"r\" of its pitch circle\n\nIn order to mesh smoothly two gears \"G\" and \"G\" must have the same sized teeth and therefore they must have the same pitch \"p\", which means\nThis equation shows that the ratio of the circumference, the diameters and the radii of two meshing gears is equal to the ratio of their number of teeth,\n\nThe speed ratio of two gears rolling without slipping on their pitch circles is given by,\n\ntherefore\n\nIn other words, the gear ratio, or speed ratio, is inversely proportional to the radius of the pitch circle and the number of teeth of the input gear.\n\nA gear train can be analyzed using the principle of virtual work to show that its torque ratio, which is the ratio of its output torque to its input torque, is equal to the gear ratio, or speed ratio, of the gear train.\n\nThis means the input torque \"Τ\" applied to the input gear \"G\" and the output torque \"Τ\" on the output gear \"G\" are related by the ratio\nwhere \"R\" is the gear ratio of the gear train.\n\nThe torque ratio of a gear train is also known as its mechanical advantage\n\nIn a sequence of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. However, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.\n\nAn intermediate gear which does not drive a shaft to perform any work is called an gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may be referred to as a \"reverse idler\". For instance, the typical automobile manual transmission engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears.\n\nIdler gears can also transmit rotation among distant shafts in situations where it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, the mass and rotational inertia (moment of inertia) of a gear is proportional to the square of its radius. Instead of idler gears, a toothed belt or chain can be used to transmit torque over distance.\n\nIf a simple gear train has three gears, such that the input gear \"G\" meshes with an intermediate gear \"G\" which in turn meshes with the output gear \"G\", then the pitch circle of the intermediate gear rolls without slipping on both the pitch circles of the input and output gears. This yields the two relations\nThe speed ratio of this gear train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtain\nNotice that this gear ratio is exactly the same as for the case when the gears \"G\" and \"G\" engage directly. The intermediate gear provides spacing but does not affect the gear ratio. For this reason it is called an \"idler\" gear. The same gear ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler gears and hence an idler gear is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven gear. If the driver gear moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven gear also moves in the clockwise direction with the help of the idler gear.\n\nIn the photo, assuming the smallest gear is connected to the motor, it is called the drive gear or input gear. The somewhat larger gear in the middle is called an idler gear. It is not connected directly to either the motor or the output shaft and only transmits power between the input and output gears. There is a third gear in the upper-right corner of the photo. Assuming that gear is connected to the machine's output shaft, it is the output or driven gear.\n\nThe input gear in this gear train has 13 teeth and the idler gear has 21 teeth. Considering only these gears, the gear ratio between the idler and the input gear can be calculated as if the idler gear was the output gear. Therefore, the gear ratio is driven/drive = 21/13 ≈1.62 or 1.62:1.\n\nAt this ratio, it means the drive gear must make 1.62 revolutions to turn the driven gear once. It also means that for every one revolution of the driver, the driven gear has made 1/1.62, or 0.62, revolutions. Essentially, the larger gear turns slower.\n\nThe third gear in the picture has 42 teeth. The gear ratio between the idler and third gear is thus 42/21, or 2:1, and hence the final gear ratio is 1.62x2≈3.23. For every 3.23 revolutions of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns one revolution, or for every one revolution of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns 0.31 (1/3.23) revolution, a total reduction of about 1:3.23 (Gear Reduction Ratio (GRR) = 1/Gear Ratio (GR)).\n\nSince the idler gear contacts directly both the smaller and the larger gear, it can be removed from the calculation, also giving a ratio of 42/13≈3.23. The idler gear serves to make both the drive gear and the driven gear rotate in the same direction, but confers no mechanical advantage.\n\nBelts can have teeth in them also and be coupled to gear-like pulleys. Special gears called sprockets can be coupled together with chains, as on bicycles and some motorcycles. Again, exact accounting of teeth and revolutions can be applied with these machines.\n\nFor example, a belt with teeth, called the timing belt, is used in some internal combustion engines to synchronize the movement of the camshaft with that of the crankshaft, so that the valves open and close at the top of each cylinder at exactly the right time relative to the movement of each piston. A chain, called a timing chain, is used on some automobiles for this purpose, while in others, the camshaft and crankshaft are coupled directly together through meshed gears. Regardless of which form of drive is employed, the crankshaft-to-camshaft gear ratio is always 2:1 on four-stroke engines, which means that for every two revolutions of the crankshaft the camshaft will rotate once.\n\nAutomobile drivetrains generally have two or more major areas where gearing is used. Gearing is employed in the transmission, which contains a number of different sets of gears that can be changed to allow a wide range of vehicle speeds, and also in the differential, which contains the final drive to provide further speed reduction at the wheels. In addition, the differential contains further gearing that splits torque equally between the two wheels while permitting them to have different speeds when travelling in a curved path. The transmission and final drive might be separate and connected by a driveshaft, or they might be combined into one unit called a transaxle. The gear ratios in transmission and final drive are important because different gear ratios will change the characteristics of a vehicle's performance.\n\nA 2004 Chevrolet Corvette C5 Z06 with a six-speed manual transmission has the following gear ratios in the transmission:\nIn 1st gear, the engine makes 2.97 revolutions for every revolution of the transmission's output. In 4th gear, the gear ratio of 1:1 means that the engine and the transmission's output rotate at the same speed. 5th and 6th gears are known as overdrive gears, in which the output of the transmission is revolving faster than the engine's output.\n\nThe Corvette above has an axle ratio of 3.42:1, meaning that for every 3.42 revolutions of the transmission's output, the wheels make one revolution. The differential ratio multiplies with the transmission ratio, so in 1st gear, the engine makes 10.16 revolutions for every revolution of the wheels.\n\nThe car's tires can almost be thought of as a third type of gearing. This car is equipped with 295/35-18 tires, which have a circumference of 82.1 inches. This means that for every complete revolution of the wheel, the car travels . If the Corvette had larger tires, it would travel farther with each revolution of the wheel, which would be like a higher gear. If the car had smaller tires, it would be like a lower gear.\n\nWith the gear ratios of the transmission and differential and the size of the tires, it becomes possible to calculate the speed of the car for a particular gear at a particular engine RPM.\n\nFor example, it is possible to determine the distance the car will travel for one revolution of the engine by dividing the circumference of the tire by the combined gear ratio of the transmission and differential.\n\nformula_23\n\nIt is also possible to determine a car's speed from the engine speed by multiplying the circumference of the tire by the engine speed and dividing by the combined gear ratio.\n\nformula_24\n\nNote that the answer is in inches per minute, which can be converted to mph by dividing by 1056. \n\nA close-ratio transmission is a transmission in which there is a relatively little difference between the gear ratios of the gears. For example, a transmission with an engine shaft to drive shaft ratio of 4:1 in first gear and 2:1 in second gear would be considered wide-ratio when compared to another transmission with a ratio of 4:1 in first and 3:1 in second. This is because the close-ratio transmission has less of a progression between gears. For the wide-ratio transmission, the first gear ratio is 4:1 or 4, and in second gear it is 2:1 or 2, so the progression is equal to 4/2 = 2 (or 200%). For the close-ratio transmission, first gear has a 4:1 ratio or 4, and second gear has a ratio of 3:1 or 3, so the progression between gears is 4/3, or 133%. Since 133% is less than 200%, the transmission with the smaller progression between gears is considered close-ratio. However, the difference between a close-ratio and wide-ratio transmission is subjective and relative.\n\nClose-ratio transmissions are generally offered in sports cars, sport bikes, and especially in race vehicles, where the engine is tuned for maximum power in a narrow range of operating speeds, and the driver or rider can be expected to shift often to keep the engine in its power band.\n\nFactory 4-speed or 5-speed transmission ratios generally have a greater difference between gear ratios and tend to be effective for ordinary driving and moderate performance use. Wider gaps between ratios allow a higher 1st gear ratio for better manners in traffic, but cause engine speed to decrease more when shifting. Narrowing the gaps will increase acceleration at speed, and potentially improve top speed under certain conditions, but acceleration from a stopped position and operation in daily driving will suffer.\n\n\"Range\" is the torque multiplication difference between 1st and 4th gears; wider-ratio gear-sets have more, typically between 2.8 and 3.2. This is the single most important determinant of low-speed acceleration from stopped.\n\n\"Progression\" is the reduction or decay in the percentage drop in engine speed in the next gear, for example after shifting from 1st to 2nd gear. Most transmissions have some degree of progression in that the RPM drop on the 1-2 shift is larger than the RPM drop on the 2-3 shift, which is in turn larger than the RPM drop on the 3-4 shift. The progression may not be linear (continuously reduced) or done in proportionate stages for various reasons, including a special need for a gear to reach a specific speed or RPM for passing, racing and so on, or simply economic necessity that the parts were available.\n\nRange and progression are not mutually exclusive, but each limits the number of options for the other. A wide range, which gives a strong torque multiplication in 1st gear for excellent manners in low-speed traffic, especially with a smaller motor, heavy vehicle, or numerically low axle ratio such as 2.50, means the progression percentages must be high. The amount of engine speed, and therefore power, lost on each up-shift is greater than would be the case in a transmission with less range, but less power in 1st gear. A numerically low 1st gear, such as 2:1, reduces available torque in 1st gear, but allows more choices of progression.\n\nThere is no optimal choice of transmission gear ratios or a final drive ratio for best performance at all speeds, as gear ratios are compromises, and not necessarily better than the original ratios for certain purposes. \n\n"}

In 2005, MetraPark Arena marked its 30th anniversary. The arena was renovated in 2010 and 2011 at a cost of $27 million.\n\nThe arena was completed in 1975 and named the METRA, an acronym that stood for Montana Entertainment Trade and Recreation Arena. Later the entire grounds surrounding the arena was named MetraPark, and the arena became MetraPark Arena. The naming rights were sold to Billings-based Rimrock Auto Group in 2007 and the arena went by the name Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark. It is owned by Yellowstone County. On June 20, 2010, a tornado dubbed the Father's Day Tornado hit the arena, causing major damage In 2010–2011 the arena was remodeled, resulting in many new amenities such as improved acoustics, more restrooms and concession areas, and easier access from the parking areas.

Although still physically in place, it is no longer in use.\n\nIn February 12, 1900, Lincoln's first municipal auditorium, though owned by Lancaster County and operated by the local chapter of the American Legion, opened. The building was burnt to the ground in an accident on April 15, 1928.\n\nBy 1931, the city of Lincoln was planning to build a new auditorium and name it after General John J. Pershing, based on votes from students that would ultimately form and attend Lincoln Northeast High School. In 1939, city of Lincoln voters approved a $750,000 bond to build a new auditorium. A second bond in 1950, at cost of $1.5 million, was approved, but an additional $75,000 bond was rejected in 1952. Plans for Pershing were approved in 1955 and the building opened two years later.\n\nPershing's exterior is highlighted by a large ceramic tile mural, designed by artists Leonard Thiessen and Bill J. Hammon. Measuring 38-by-140 foot (5320 sq. ft.; 494.2 m) and consisting of 763,000 1-sq.-inch pieces, it was the largest ceramic tile mural in the United States at the time of its construction.\n\nThe arena was home to the Lincoln Capitols NIFL indoor football team Lincoln Thunder ABA basketball team and the No Coast Derby Girls Women's Flat Track Derby Association league. In 2013, it was home to the Lincoln Haymakers of the Champions Professional Indoor Football League.\n\nPershing was also a host site for the NSAA boys and girls state basketball, as well as the NSAA girls volleyball championships. It has hosted the national roller-skating championships 28 times, beginning in 1962 though the final 2014 meet, called Last Lap At Pershing. \n\nPershing has held many events in the past, including concerts and WWE/TNA house show wrestling events. The Doors played their first concert since the death of their singer Jim Morrison at Pershing on November 12, 1971. The Grateful Dead's performance, on February 26, 1973, was recorded and makes up half of their live album, entitled \"Dick's Picks Volume 28\". The exterior and marquee of the arena are also featured in the 1981 film, \"This is Elvis\", as it hosted one of Elvis Presley's final concerts in 1977. Phish played the arena in 1995.\n\nIn 2008-2009, discussions began to build a new, larger arena for Lincoln due to mid-sized arenas no longer able to meet the demands of most tours. According to Pershing General Manager Tom Lorenz \"the music and entertainment industry has pulled back on midlevel tours, reducing the number of shows likely to come to Pershing. Normally, Pershing has six to eight concerts annually, but this year will have three or four\". A subsidy to cover a budget shortfall of $150,000 was passed by the Lincoln City Council because the situation was so dire, only \"10 months into the fiscal year.\" The larger arena in Lincoln's Haymarket District was ultimately built between 2011 and 2013, opening as Pinnacle Bank Arena opened in August 2013.\n\nThe final major event, a concert by Goo Goo Dolls, was held at the Pershing Center August 6, 2014. The last usage of the building was a roller derby match August 23, 2014 between the No Coast Derby Girls and the Kansas City Roller Warriors; it was won by the Kansas City Roller Warriors. \n\nAn RfP was sent out by the City of Lincoln in 2014 looking for reuse plans for the Pershing Center, but none of the proposals were acceptable due to cost. Demolition may be in the building's future if an alternate use is not found. The contents of the Pershing Center were auctioned off in January-February 2015. \n\nMembers of the community have also voiced their desire to save the large, iconic mural on the auditorium's exterior. Estimates place preservation and re-installation of the mural elsewhere at $1.2 million.\n\nAs of 2018, the auditorium's future is unclear. It remains standing, and is used only as a storage facility for the Pinnacle Bank Arena. Many proposals have been floated by private groups and government agencies, but none that the city government (who does not plan to demolish the building) has found acceptable.\n\n"}

The site opened as RAF Hurn in 1941, but was transferred to civil control in 1944. For a short period Hurn served as London's international airport, until the opening of facilities at Heathrow. Commercial services resumed in the late 1950s, with Palmair commencing flights to Palma, Majorca in October 1958.\n\nSubsequently, Ryanair and TUI Airways based aircraft at the airport, with scheduled flights now frequently serving Western Europe and the Mediterranean area, with charter and seasonal services serving North Africa, North America, and the Caribbean. Passenger numbers peaked in 2007 when just over one million passed through the airport. In 2016, the passenger total was around 670,000.\n\nRyanair and TUI Airways are the primary users of the airport, which was owned and operated by Manchester Airports Group (MAG), the largest British airport operator until December 2017, when Regional & City Airports (RCA) acquired Bournemouth Airport for an undisclosed amount.\n\nBournemouth Airport is situated on the edge of Hurn village in the Borough of Christchurch, north of Bournemouth, west of the A338 and approximately south west of London. The airport is accessible via the A31 from the M27 and M3 motorways to the east, and via the A35 to the west. The nearest other airports serving the area are Exeter International Airport, Bristol Airport and Southampton Airport.\n\nBefore World War II, Bournemouth's airport was Christchurch Airfield.\nFrom November 1944, the airfield took over from Bristol's Whitchurch airport as the main operating base for British Overseas Airways Corporation until Heathrow fully opened in 1948. Starting in October 1945, Hurn served as London's transatlantic airport until Heathrow opened to the airlines in mid-1946. In January 1946 Pan Am opened a scheduled New York (La Guardia) to London (Hurn) service, five days a week, using the new DC-4; the journey time was 17hours 40minutes.It was also the starting point of the first England-Australia landplane service, which took three days in Avro Lancastrians (modified Lancaster bombers). \n\nThe first Palmair charter from the airport took place in 1958, using a single 36-seat Viking aircraft destined for Palma de Mallorca. The service was one of the first charter flights in the United Kingdom.\n\nVickers-Armstrongs took over some ex-BOAC hangars at Hurn in 1951 and started production of Varsities, then Viscounts and eventually, as the British Aircraft Corporation, the BAC One-Eleven. During a 33-year period, 222 One-Elevens, 146 Varsities and 279 Viscounts were built and delivered from Hurn making a total of 647 produced at this site.\n\nSome of the development of the ill-fated TSR-2 was also done here (although assembly and flight testing was carried out at Warton, Lancs), as well as the production of Jet Provost wings; other components were manufactured here for Concorde, the Panavia Tornado and Short Skyvan. The closure of the British Aerospace site in 1984 ended Bournemouth's role as a significant player in the aircraft manufacturing industry. The former aircraft factory now forms one of Dorset's largest industrial sites, including a base for Cobham plc.\n\nAdjacent to the entrance to Bournemouth Airport was the College of Air Traffic Control, operated by NATS, the now privatised provider of air traffic control services in the UK. Established by the Ministry of Civil Aviation as the School of Air Traffic Control in 1949, the establishment was retitled as a college in 1962. Students from home and abroad were trained in all aspects of ATC operations and went on to work throughout the world. Electronic computer-based ATC simulators were widely employed. Usefully situated at an operational airfield, for a considerable period training in approach radar control was facilitated by the airport ATC unit. Students were able to practise live radar control exercises using temporarily detached Civil Aviation Flying Unit Dove aircraft as live targets. The building was also the home to the Air Traffic Control Evaluation Unit, responsible for developing technology used within the service.\n\nDuring 2011, NATS transferred ATC training to its headquarters facility at Whiteley near Southampton. The Hurn facility was purchased by a free school, Parkfield School, serving Bournemouth and the local area.\n\nIn 1969, the airport was purchased jointly by the Bournemouth Corporation and Dorset County Council and renamed as \"Bournemouth Hurn Airport\", later to become Bournemouth International Airport. The new owners decided to redevelop the facility as a commercial airport and, by 1980, the airport became used by charter airlines, when European Aviation began services.\n\nIn 1993, the airport received its first regular passenger flights when Palmair wet leased its first aircraft and European Aviation Air Charter (EAC) started operations. In 1995, the airport was sold to National Express and then, in March 2001, was acquired by the Manchester Airports Group, which was at that time the second-largest owner of UK airports.\n\nIn 1996, an extension to the main runway was officially opened by the arrival of Concorde. Travel agency Bath Travel chartered Concorde for supersonic champagne lunches across the Bay of Biscay. Ryanair also began services from Bournemouth to Dublin with a Boeing 737-200.\n\nSince 2001, a Boeing 747SP has been based at the airport; it is used by the Royal Family of Qatar and other VIP government staff from the Middle East state of Qatar. The aircraft is often stored in the former BASCO building (Hangar 12) and is a regular visitor to Zürich Airport and Heathrow.\n\nIn late 2001, Bournemouth Flying Club took the leap into full commercial flight training and established Bournemouth Commercial Flight Training on the former SFT site adjacent to the threshold for runway 08. Bournemouth Commercial Flight Training (BCFT) has adapted and expanded throughout its history, contributing to the overall success of the airport and continuing to make Bournemouth Airport important to the overall commercial flight training in the UK.\n\nBath Travel's Palmair remained the prime user of the airport, with a 737-200 permanently based there. In 2005, Thomsonfly became the first major low-cost airline to establish a hub at Bournemouth, allocating two Boeing 737-300 aircraft for scheduled services to Europe and (in 2008) to the Caribbean. Also in 2005, Air Berlin and EasyJet began services by announcing routes to Paderborn and Geneva respectively. Air Berlin have now ceased operations at the airport. The airport previously had a daily service to the Channel Islands provided by the Jersey-based Blue Islands airline, which withdrew from Bournemouth in April 2009. Hungarian-based Wizz Air also ran routes to Gdansk, Katowice, and Kraków during 2006 and 2007.\n\nIn 2007, Ryanair began to rapidly increase the number of services from the airport, initially starting routes to Marseille, Alicante, and Milan which brought the total to eight. In 2008, Palmair introduced a new series of charter flights to Tunisia, Fuerteventura, Naples, Amalfi Coast, and Rhodes. Olympic Holidays also launched new charter flights to Corfu and Zakynthos in Greece and Larnaca in Cyprus.\n\nOn 9 January 2008, Ryanair announced that they would base one of their Boeing 737-800s at Bournemouth from April 2008. During the first quarter, the airline announced routes to Málaga, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca, Wroclaw and the re-introduction of the Nantes route. An additional flight each day was added to the Glasgow Prestwick route, with the addition of a twice-daily flight to Edinburgh. In May the same year, Bergamo and Beauvais routes were announced to commence in October plus a new weekly ski flight to Turin for the winter season.\n\nIncreasing from 14 routes, after the discontinuation of the Nantes route, to 18 – Carcassonne, Faro, Limoges, and Reus were added to the route network in February 2009.\n\nOn 25 November 2008, Bournemouth Airport was ranked best airport in the United Kingdom and third best in the world, after Singapore Changi Airport and Hong Kong International Airport, by the \"Daily Telegraph\" Travel Awards.\n\nIn December 2009, bmibaby announced a new summer route to Jersey. It was the first time the airline had operated out of the airport; they provided three services a week, using a Boeing 737-500.\nAgain in December, Ryanair added four new routes to the network, bringing the total to 17. Another Boeing 737-800 was based at the airport and the airline projected to fly 650,000 passengers at Bournemouth, however the actual figure was lower.\n\nFollowing the closure of European Aviation Air Charter, Palmair chartered various aircraft types from Jet2, Viking, Blue Line, Tor Air and Astraeus, before unveiling their new Astraeus-leased Boeing 737-500 (G-PJPJ) on 13 May 2009. The original agreement was for the aircraft to be leased until April 2012, but the airline ceased operations in October 2010.\n\nFlybe started services in May 2010 but discontinued services in November the same year. It led to no scheduled services from the airport. After a hiatus of services, Blue Islands recommenced services to Guernsey and Jersey on 1 November 2011. Flybe announced on 10 November 2015 that all destinations would end 27 March 2016\n\nIn September 2016 one of the UK's newest AOC's Scenic Air Tours started operations from the airport, offering pleasure/scenic flights along the south coast and aircraft rentals. The company has now expanded with a second operating base at Durham Tees Valley Airport in the North East. The company operates two Piper PA-28 and one Grumman American AA-5.\n\nIn November 2016, Bournemouth based Eagle European commenced operations on its A – B AOC, flying the Cessna 421 Golden Eagle on charter flights, focusing heavily on the medical role.\n\nWith the budget increased to £45million in July 2008, the upgrade will replace the arrivals terminal and upgrade the check-in and departure lounge areas. The number of aircraft stands would rise from four to 11. Christchurch Council and central government backed plans for the re-building of the airport terminal, increasing its size by 62%; work started in August 2007.\n\nWork on the terminal itself is now complete, where the check-in areas, security control, and departure lounges have been upgraded. A new World Duty Free store has opened on the airside, as have a new WHSmith store and an The Olive Tree eatery. All remaining retail space has since been completed and opened.\n\nThe new arrivals hall was completed on time and budget in July 2011. The building produces 70% less carbon dioxide than the previous facility with the design taking advantage of the building's orientation to make maximum possible use of solar gain, solar shading, daylight, and natural ventilation. These measures will reduce the need for mechanical and electrical installations which, in turn, will reduce the building's energy requirements.\n\nOther improvements to the infrastructure around the airport include more frequent bus services to Bournemouth Interchange and traffic lights at the entrance to the airport have been constructed.\n\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled, seasonal, and seasonal charter flights to and from Bournemouth:\n\nThe airport has a industrial park, including offices and hangars. In early March 2009, Manchester Airport Developments completed the construction of Cirrus Court, a development of 14 industrial units which is the first part of a number of phases to redevelop the northern aviation sector.\n\nWhen Channel Express operated, its head office was in Building 470 at the airport.\n\nBabcock International Group has its Defence and Security offices located at the airport.\n\nL3 CTS (formerly CTC Aviation) has its main U.K flight training base at the airfield with students completing basic, intermediate and advanced training there. Located on the East side from its purpose built hangar, the company operates a fleet of Diamond DA42, Slingsby T67 Firefly and recently Diamond DA40 aircraft. Their Bournemouth base complements its facilities in Southampton, Coventry, Ponte de Sor (Portugal), Hamilton (New Zealand) and recently opened satellite base in Cranfield.\n\nBournemouth Commercial Flight Training and Airline Pilot Academy Operates from its main office and hangar on Aviation Park West adjacent to the National Police Air Service (NPAS) facility. The apron provides parking for its commercial fleet including two BE76 Duchess and four Piper PA-28 aircraft. They also have hangared aircraft belonging to the company, including a Pilatus PC-12, a SIAI-Marchetti SF.260, a Beagle B.121 Pup, a Scottish Aviation Bulldog, a Partenavia P.68 and several Robin HR 200 aircraft. BCFT specialises in modular flight training whilst its sister company APA is pioneering a new and dynamic approach to Integrated Flight Training with bases at Bournemouth International Airport and Orlando Melbourne International Airport.\n\nScenic Air Tours, an A to A AOC holder, also operates from Aviation Park West with its main base of operation at the airport, its secondary base located at Durham Tees Valley Airport houses one of its Piper PA-28 aircraft available for Sightseeing and Aerial Photography. The Bournemouth-based fleet consists of a Piper PA-28 and Grumman American AA-5 both available for sightseeing trips and rentals.\n\nBournemouth is home of a dedicated Pilatus maintenance facility, focusing on the Pilatus PC-12, serving aircraft from across Europe. Jetfly Aviation, a fractional ownership company, uses the Bournemouth facility for its maintenance needs and has aircraft and crew based at the airport.\n\nAs well as the Pilatus maintenance facility the airport is also home to several others, all specialising in various areas of the industry. The largest for general aviation aircraft is Airtime Aviation, providing maintenance for aircraft up to the size of Beechcraft King Air. Airtime also provide aircraft painting through its sister company, Airtime Paint, handling all kinds of aircraft including small jets. Fast Aviation also provides maintenance for general aviation aircraft and is based on the north side of the airfield. MCA provide specialist King Air support and maintenance, with several worldwide contracts. Jets and Technic Air provide maintenance for Jet aircraft and smaller turboprop airliners.\n\nHandling for General Aviation aircraft is provided by two companies, Bliss Aviation a small flight school specialising in Helicopter training provide handling for smaller aircraft such as Piper PA-28 and larger multi engine pistons like Piper Chieftain and Beechcraft Baron. Larger coperate aircraft are handled by Signature Flight Support, often handling aircraft up to the size of Gulfstream G650 and Falcon 7X.\n\n\n"}

It was the first Supremes single to feature new lead singer Jean Terrell in place of Diana Ross, who officially left the group for a solo career two weeks before the recording of this song in January 1970. This song also marks a number of other firsts: it is the first Supremes single since \"The Happening\" in 1967 to be released under the name \"The Supremes\" instead of \"Diana Ross & The Supremes\", the first Supremes single solely produced by Norman Whitfield associate Frank Wilson, and the first Supremes single to make the United Kingdom Top 10 since \"Reflections\" in 1967.\n\nFrank Wilson wrote the music for the song, with lyrics written by an Italian-American songwriter from New York City named Vincent DiMirco.\n\n\"Up the Ladder to the Roof\" rose to number ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number five on the soul chart, in the spring of 1970. Outside the US, The Supremes scored a #6 smash with the song in the UK and number eight in Canada.\n\n"}

{"id": "1956935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956935", "title": "Traces of Death", "text": "Traces of Death\n\nTraces of Death is a 1993 Z movie mondo shockumentary that consists of various scenes of stock footage depicting death and real scenes of violence.\n\nUnlike the earlier \"Faces of Death\" which included fake deaths and reenactments, \"Traces\" consists mostly of actual footage depicting death and injury, and consists also of public domain footage from other films. It was written and narrated by Damon Fox.\n\nSince its release, \"Traces of Death\" has been followed by four sequels. The first sequel, \"Traces of Death II\", was released in June 1994. This was followed by \"Traces of Death III\" in December 1994, \"Traces of Death IV: Resurrected\" in 1996 and \"Traces of Death V: Back in Action\" in April 2000.\n\nIn the first two films of the series, Damon Fox was the narrator. Darrin Ramage, who would later become the founder of Brain Damage Films, would become the host for the third, fourth and fifth volumes. Unlike \"Faces of Death\", the footage throughout the entire films are real and are not staged or reenacted. Starting with \"Traces of Death 2\", scenes were accompanied by background music from death metal and grindcore bands.\n\nAlso contained in the series, especially in the first one, is footage of step-by-step autopsy procedures, which are shown from a coroner's point of view. Most of the other footage is recognizably notable. Among the footage samples seen on \"Traces of Death\" and in the sequels that followed are listed below.\n\n\nThe first film of the series also contains allegedly staged footage from \"Ultime grida dalla savana\", where a tourist, Pit Dernitz supposedly gets mauled and eaten by African lions.\n\nOther scenes that feature animals include undated footage of a pig experiment by U.S. Army scientists at the Burn Center in Fort Sam Houston (derived from a 1987 mondo film entitled \"True Gore\"), and a black bear getting shocked off a utility pole in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1989.\n\nThe first two films both contain scenes of sex reassignment surgery, which is featured in the 1974 mondo film \"Shocking Asia\". Some autopsy footages were taken from the U.S. Army medical film, \"Basic Autopsy Procedure\".\n\nIt features an interview of James Vance, who attempted suicide at the church playground in Sparks, Nevada.\n\nAlso including a footage from the evidence of Ilse Koch (the sadistic \"Bitсh of Buchenwald\").\n\n\nThere is one unusual piece of footage taken at a monster truck show in Baltimore, Maryland, on March 23, 1992. What makes this footage so unusual is that the robot transformer at the show malfunctioned. A big rod from the malfunctioning robot went into the actor of the alien suit's chest, and exploded.\n\nAnother notable air show crash in the film took place in Plainview, Texas, on September 11, 1983, where the pilot lost both his plane's wings in mid-air and plummeted into the field below. There are many other various plane crashes and race car crashes during the middle and towards the end of the film.\n\n\nThe third edition starts with crime scenes in urban American cities such as New York City, ranging from murders to traffic accidents. These pieces look as if taken from the '60s and '70s.\n\nThis volume also shows what its like to survive an attack, as of a 1991 press conference of Frank Tempest, an English man disfigured in the face when he was attacked by two pit bulls.\n\nAlso included is graphic content of gang violence in Russia, various motocross and amateur race car accidents.\n\n\nAnother piece of notable footage in the fourth volume is a moose killing a man in Anchorage, Alaska on January 9, 1995.\n\nTowards the start of the film graphic photographs of birth aberrations are shown.\n\nThere is also footage of traffic accidents from the graphic driving education film, \"Signal 30\".\n\n\nThe last volume starts with three police chases. The first was in Los Angeles, California, in June 1996. The second was in Los Angeles as well, but it took place in June 1995. The third took place in Whittier, California in September 1995.\n\nAll were televised live by helicopter pilot Bob Tur.\n\nThe original soundtrack was derived from the 1989 film \"Robot Ninja\", was composed and directed by J. R. Bookwalter (initially credited as T.O.D.). Later in \"Traces of Death 2\", many death metal and grindcore artists were featured on film.\n\nIn 2003, a box set of the entire series was released on DVD by Brain Damage Films.\n\nThe original \"Traces of Death\" has ran into controversy worldwide due to its graphic content. In 1997, Amy Hochberg, a woman living in Coaldale, Pennsylvania rented the film from a video store and was so disgusted by the film's content that she considered keeping the tape as to avoid children from procuring it from the store. She also contacted multiple animal rights groups after witnessing a scene in the film wherein a pig is experimented on with a blowtorch. She also lodged a complaint with the video store she had rented it from, as she thought the film was simply \"911 calls with a little more\".\n\nIn 2003, a DVD boxset of the film and its sequels were confiscated by Australian Customs, after being deemed to \"contravene Regulation 4A(1A)(a) of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations.\"\n\nIn 2005, the British Board of Film Classification refused to give the first film an age certificate, effectively banning it. The BBFC considered the film to have \"no journalistic, educational or other justifying context for the images shown\", while also suggesting that the film could potentially breach UK law under the Obscene Publications Act.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1956937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956937", "title": "Ground fighting", "text": "Ground fighting\n\nGround fighting (also called ground work or ground game) is hand-to-hand combat, wrestling or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which takes place while the combatants are on the ground. The term is commonly used in mixed martial arts and other combat sports, as well as various forms of martial arts to designate the set of grappling techniques employed by a combatant that is on the ground. It is the main focus of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and is featured in varying amounts in Catch wrestling, Judo, Sambo, Shoot wrestling, Dishuquan Dog Kung Fu, some schools of Shuai Jiao and other styles of wrestling.\n\nSimilarly to clinch fighting, ground fighting implies that the combatants are at a very close range, usually involving one or both combatants grappling the opponent using various grappling holds. Depending on the positioning of the combatants, the proximity can allow for techniques such as biting, chokeholds, fish-hooking, eye-gouging, joint locks, pressure point techniques, or various strikes.\n\nTraditionally neglected by most grappling arts, striking on the ground is an important aspect of ground fighting. Typically, a top position is better for various strikes than a bottom position, simply because the combatant in the top position can generate the distance and movement needed for effective strikes, while the bottom combatant is restricted by the ground and by the combatant on top. Another factor is gravity, which is in favor of the top combatant when they are striking downwards. In addition, the effect of ground strikes may be amplified, depending on the area struck, by the strike driving the opponent into the ground. The types of strikes that can be employed effectively depend on the particular grappling position. Common strikes include elbows, headbutts, knees and punches.\n\n"}
{"id": "1956941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956941", "title": "Sesil Karatantcheva", "text": "Sesil Karatantcheva\n\nSesil Radoslavova Karatantcheva (; born 8 August 1989) is a Bulgarian tennis player.\n\nShe has won seven singles titles on the ITF Women's Circuit. On 7 November 2005, she reached her best singles ranking of world No. 35. On 19 April 2010, she peaked at No. 154 in the doubles rankings.\n\nKaratantcheva is perhaps best known for reaching the quarterfinals of the 2005 French Open, upsetting seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams en route. The same year, she twice tested positive for nandrolone and was therefore issued a two-year suspension. She returned to professional competition in January 2008.\n\nShe began playing tennis at the age of five. In 2001, 12-year-old Karatantcheva won the Orange Bowl tournament for her age group, defeating Alisa Kleybanova in the final. Early in her playing days, she trained for approximately six months at the famous IMG Academy of Nick Bollettieri.\n\nKaratantcheva played her first professional tournament in September 2003 in Sofia, Bulgaria at the age of 14. As an unranked qualifier the next week, she defeated the No. 1, 2, and 3 seeds en route to her first professional tournament title at a small ITF tournament in olos, Greece. Karatantcheva went on to win two other ITF titles in 2003.\nIn 2004, Karatantcheva began her season at the WTA tournament in Indian Wells, where she defeated Alexandra Stevenson in the first, and upset the 17th seed Magüi Serna in the second round. In an interview prior to her match against 16th seed Maria Sharapova, Karatantcheva claimed that Sharapova had skipped a hitting session with her a few weeks earlier in Florida, and began a war of words with the Russian. Sharapova then defeated Karatantcheva in three sets in the third round. On April 19, she played her first match for the Bulgaria Fed Cup team. Because of her age, Karatantcheva was restricted in the number of tournaments she was able to play. In August, she reached the quarterfinals of a WTA tournament in Vancouver, British Columbia, and qualified for the US Open, before losing to eventual champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the first round. Karatantcheva also reached the quarterfinals of the WTA tournament in Québec City, and captured another ITF tournament in December at Palm Beach Gardens.\n\n2005 was Karatantcheva's breakthrough year. She started off the year at the tournament in Gold Coast, Australia by qualifying, and then defeating the tournament's No. 7 seed Elena Likhovtseva before falling in the quarterfinals. She then qualified for the Australian Open, losing to the No. 4 seed Sharapova in the first round. Her most successful tournament to date was at Roland Garros where Karatantcheva defeated the No. 19 seed Shinobu Asagoe in the second round, and then stunned the world with her victory over the No. 11 seed and former world number one Venus Williams in the third round. After defeating Emmanuelle Gagliardi, she fell to Likhovtseva in the quarterfinals. Karatantcheva became the youngest female to reach the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament since Martina Hingis in 1996. At Wimbledon, she lost to Sharapova once again, being able to win just one game.\n\nIn 2005, Karatantcheva also won a European club championship in Rennes as a member of the Cherno More Elite team (Bulgarian: Черно море Елит). Her teammates were Virginiya Trifonova, Maria Penkova and Tsvetana Pironkova.\n\nAt the end of the year, Karatantcheva came up eighth in the Bulgarian Sportsperson of the Year rankings, earning 676 points. She was also honoured by the Bulgarian Tennis Federation as the \"Best female tennis player of the year\".\n\nOn December 20, 2005, the French sports newspaper \"L'Equipe\" reported that Karatantcheva had failed a drug test earlier in the year at Roland Garros (after the 1/4 final match against Likhovtseva), and that she had appeared in front of a three-person panel of judges to explain the results. The newspaper claims that Karatantcheva said she was pregnant at the time of the test, which would explain the high levels of nandrolone in her system. Karatantcheva has denied all allegations, saying \"I am shocked. I have not appeared before judges of the international federation.\"\n\nOn 11 January 2006, the ITF issued a two-year ban after two positive drug tests for nandrolone. While Karatantcheva has claimed she was pregnant at the time of one of the tests, another laboratory carried out a pregnancy test on her urine sample, and it tested negative. On 3 July 2006, the Court of Arbitration for Sport denied her appeal to overturn the ban with the argument that said nandrolone was found in concentrations which were inconsistent with the normal levels for that stage of pregnancy.\n\nKaratantcheva did not play any matches in 2006 or 2007 following her drug ban. She mainly trained in Pravets.\n\nKaratantcheva's first match after the ban was in a pre-qualification tournament for a wildcard into the $25k tournament in Surprise, Arizona. She won three matches in one day to win the event and thus won a wildcard for the qualifying draw, in which she beat Susanna Lingman, Maria Kondratieva, and Kristína Kučová. In the main draw, Karatantcheva beat the fifth seed Sunitha Rao in three sets in the first round, and Robin Stephenson in the second round. In the quarterfinals, Karatantcheva beat Magdaléna Rybáriková in two sets, and in the semifinals she defeated the second seed Viktoriya Kutuzova. In the finals, Sesil played a tough three-set match and overcame the eighth seed American Angela Haynes.\n\nIn late January, still unranked, she entered another $25k tournament at La Quinta, and again battled through three rounds of qualifying into the main draw, despite a scare in her qualifying match against American player Stacia Fonseca, who took the first set. Having fended off a spirited challenge from second-seeded Angelika Bachmann in the first round of the main draw, she made light work of subsequent opponents en route to the semifinals, where for the second tournament in succession she was scheduled to play Viktoriya Kutuzova. This time, the match ran to three sets, but Karatantcheva ultimately prevailed in three sets. In the final, Karatantcheva defeated the third seed Sandra Klösel.\n\nKaratantcheva attracted criticism from the Bulgarian tennis federation for competing at La Quinta in preference to participating in Bulgaria's Federation Cup tie scheduled the same week. She was accused of breach of contract and threatened with a fine, but the Bulgarian teenager stood by her decision, which she had taken on the grounds that it was proving extremely difficult for her to gain entry even to low-level tournaments following the loss of all her ranking points and any right to protected ranking status after her ban, so she needed to work at re-establishing herself at least in the mid-hundreds of the WTA rankings as a matter of priority before tending to national team commitments.\n\nIn February, the Bulgarian was awarded a wildcard into the $75k Midland event, but her winning streak came to an abrupt end as she was defeated in the first round by qualifier Valérie Tétreault of Canada, who had raced through the three qualifying rounds for the loss of just nine games, five of them against former top 50 star Mirjana Lučić. Karatantcheva then attempted to qualify for the WTA Tier III event in Memphis but lost in the first round of qualifying to Hana Šromová of the Czech Republic.\n\nIn early March, she qualified for the $50k Las Vegas event including victories over Amber Liu and Elena Bovina. However, she lost in the first round of the main draw to wildcarded American Madison Brengle. She also received a wildcard into the qualifying event for the Tier I event at Indian Wells but lost in the first round of qualifying to Evgeniya Rodina. Her luck changed however, when, at the end of March, she managed to qualify and reach the final of the $50k event in Latina, losing to Iveta Benešová in straight sets.\n\nIn April, she reached the quarterfinals of the $25k event at Civitavecchia, losing to Betina Jozami of Argentina in straight sets.

This was Karatantcheva's first Grand Slam tournament main-draw appearance in almost 2 1/2 years.\n\nShe opened her grass-court season at the Aegon Classic in Birmingham. She entered the qualifying draw and defeated local girl Francesca Stephenson, but fell to Thailand's Noppawan Lertcheewakarn in the final round.

Despite the loss, her win over Görges was the biggest win of her season. Her next tournament was the Rogers Cup in Toronto where she fell in the first round of qualifying.

At the French Open, she won one match in the qualifying draw but would progress no further, as she was eliminated by Laura Siegemund in what was a tough three-set match. She would then compete in Marseille, advancing to the quarterfinals before going down to Johanna Larsson in a final-set tiebreak. Karatantcheva elected to skip all grass court events before Wimbledon, and suffered another Grand Slam defeat, this time at the hands of young Estonian Anett Kontaveit in the second round of qualifying.\n\nShe entered the inaugural Bucharest Open, winning three qualifying matches before losing to Silvia Soler Espinosa in the first round. Karatantcheva then played qualifying at the İstanbul Cup but was beaten in the first round by Ana Konjuh of Croatia. She returned to the ITF circuit at the $50k Powiat Poznański Open in Sobota, advancing to the final having only dropped a set, but suffered a disappointing three-set loss there after winning the first set. It was her first final since April 2012. At US Open qualifying she was beaten in the first round by Melanie Oudin.\n\nKaratantcheva returned to action at the Coupe Banque Nationale as a direct entrant in the main draw. She began with a win over Sanaz Marand in the first round and squared off against third seeded Kristina Mladenovic in the second, edging the Frenchwoman in a match that lasted over two-and-a-half hours. Karatantcheva subsequently moved on to the quarterfinals but was defeated there by Mirjana Lučić-Baroni, who would go on to win the tournament.\n\nIn October Karatantcheva announced, that she had decided to play for her home country Bulgaria again. She and her father first made the decision known to the Bulgarian public in an interview for TV7. Her switch back to Bulgaria was finalized a few weeks later and she reappeared under the Bulgarian flag in the 20 October WTA rankings.\n\nKaratancheva's first tournament of the year was the ASB Classic, where she has started from qualifications, losing in the third round of the qualifying competition to Urszula Radwańska after previously defeating two opponents. Karatancheva failed to qualify to the Australian Open, after losing in the second qualifying round to Alexandra Panova. In February Karatantcheva participated at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel, where she started from qualifications. She was defeated in straight sets in the third qualifying round by Lucie Hradecká, but nonetheless reached the main tournament as a lucky loser. Karatantcheva then eliminated Marie Bouzková, Kiki Bertens and Monica Puig to secure herself a place in the semifinals for the second time in her career. She subsequently lost to fifth seed Timea Bacsinszky in two sets. Next, she played at Monterrey Open, where she lost in the first round of qualifications. Despite the setback, Karatantcheva was nonetheless able to stay on course towards improving her ranking by qualifying for the main phase of the BNP Paribas Open shortly after that. In the first round, she managed a two-set victory over compatriot and friend Tsvetana Pironkova. This was the first time since 2000 that two Bulgarian women had met in the main draw of a WTA tournament. Karatantcheva then suffered a defeat in straight sets to CoCo Vandeweghe. Next, Karatantcheva qualified for the main draw of Miami Open, where she reached the second round, defeating Lauren Davis then ranked No. 61, in the first round in straight sets, and losing to 21st seed Garbiñe Muguruza. Her ranking improved to 109. Next, at the Family Circle Cup in Charleston, she qualified for the main draw, beating Arantxa Rus and Louisa Chirico along the way, and lost in the first round to ninth seed Samantha Stosur. At the French Open, Karatantcheva was seeded 3rd in the qualifying draw and she qualified for the main draw. In the first round she defeated former world No. 1, Jelena Janković, in straight sets, which allowed her to return to the top 100 in the WTA rankings. Then, she lost in the second round to Irina Falconi in three sets. Due to her improved ranking, Karatantcheva began directly from the main draw at the Wimbledon Championships. In the first round she lost to Silvia Soler Espinosa in a tight three-setter match. At the US Open, Karatantcheva suffered a 1–6, 2–6 loss to Belinda Bencic from Switzerland.\n\nThe new season began with a disappointment at Brisbane, where she lost in the first round of the qualifying draw. She played at Sydney, starting once again from the qualifications, defeating Yaroslava Shvedova (after taking a 4–1 lead in the first set and her opponent retiring) in the first round, but then succumbing in straight sets to Magdaléna Rybáriková. At the qualifying competition for the Australian Open Karatantcheva was seeded fourth. However, she was unable to pass the first hurdle, being defeated 6–2, 6–0 by American Jessica Pegula. Karatantcheva did not manage to reach the main draw of the 2016 French Open, losing to Maryna Zanevska in three sets after taking the first one in the second round of qualifying, for which she was not among the seeds. Her downturn in fortunes continued in Wimbledon, where she suffered elimination in the first round of the qualifying competition at the hands of Shérazad Reix in a hard-fought match that was decided in three sets. At the qualifying competition for the US Open, Karatantcheva posted a win in three sets against Rebecca Šramková in the first round, but was then defeated by Elise Mertens in another three-setter match.\n\nKaratantcheva did not get past the first hurdle at the qualifying tournament for the Australian Open, being on the receiving end of a 6–3, 6–2 defeat by Anna Blinkova. After not participating in the qualifying competitions for the French Open and Wimbledon, in late August 2017 she entered the one for the US Open, where she convincingly defeated Arantxa Rus in the first round, but then lost in a dramatic three-setter match (that was decided by a tiebreak) against American Claire Liu. In September 2017, Karatantcheva won the title at the Red Rock Pro Open in Las Vegas, defeating compatriot Elitsa Kostova in the final by a score of 6–4, 4–6, 7–5.\n\nKaratantcheva participated in the qualifying competition for the Australian Open, but had to exit in the first round after losing 5–7, 6–3, 5–7 to Irina Bara. She was also eliminated in the earliest possible stage at the qualifying tournament for the French Open, being on the receiving end of a 1–6, 6–2, 2–6 loss against Ons Jabeur. The negative trend continued in her first qualifying match for Wimbledon, in which she emerged second best to Mayo Hibi by a score of 6–1, 3–6, 1–6. The qualifying event for the US Open saw a repeat of her previous performances, as Karatantcheva did not get past the first round, being defeated 6–3, 2–6, 6–4 by Italian Martina Trevisan.\n\nKaratantcheva entered the qualifying tournament for the Australian Open, taking the first set against American Asia Muhammad, but eventually losing the other two, thus going out in the first round. Her luck didn't change during the qualifying competition for Wimbledon where she was defeated in straight sets by Romanian Elena-Gabriela Ruse.\n\nShe is the daughter of former rower and member of parliament as part of the Bulgarian Business Bloc, Radoslav Karatantchev. He is currently a member of the Bulgarian Socialist Party and also acts as Karatatcheva′s coach.\n\nShe has three sisters, one of whom, Gabriel Karatantcheva, was active as a professional tennis player from 2014 to 2017. Karatantcheva married long-time boyfriend and former footballer Georgi Dolmov in November 2017.\n\nSesil Karatantcheva debuted for the Bulgaria Fed Cup team in 2004, winning her singles match in the tie against the Estonia Fed Cup team. Between 2010 and 2014 she competed for the Kazakhstan Fed Cup team. She maintains a 12–5 singles record and a 7–8 doubles record (19–13 overall). In January 2017, Karatantcheva was recalled to the Bulgarian team for the February 2017 Europe/Africa Zone (Group I) matches.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1956955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956955", "title": "Degradation Trip", "text": "Degradation Trip\n\nDegradation Trip is the second and most recent solo album by Alice in Chains guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell, released on June 18, 2002. It marks his difficult transition from Columbia Records to Roadrunner, and was dedicated to Alice in Chains lead singer Layne Staley, who died two months before the album's release. The title was taken from the song \"Solitude\", the fifth track from the album. \"Degradation Trip\" featured two singles and was well received by critics, faring better than Cantrell's solo debut and bearing stronger resemblance to his work in Alice in Chains. \"\"Anger Rising\"\" and \"\"Angel Eyes\"\" were released as singles. \"\"Anger Rising\"\" reached No. 10 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks and stayed on the chart for 18 weeks. The album has sold 100,000 copies in the U.S. as of December 2002. In April 2019, it was ranked No. 21 on Rolling Stone's \"50 Greatest Grunge Albums\" list. \"Degradation Trip\" was released on vinyl for the first time on January 20, 2017, with a limited edition of 1,500 copies on transparent green vinyl.\n\nThe album was the result of an intense writing process that resulted in 25 songs. Cantrell enlisted new bandmates (Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin and then-Ozzy Osbourne/Black Label Society bassist Robert Trujillo) to officially dissociate himself from the incapacitated Alice in Chains and, after being dropped from Columbia, faced a turbulent recording process funded entirely by himself. After a lack of label interest, Cantrell eventually acquired a deal with Roadrunner who requested that he condense the material to 14 tracks. On November 26, 2002, the full \"Degradation Trip\" sessions' songs were released in their entirety as \"Degradation Trip Volumes 1 & 2\". Cantrell's backing band for the \"Degradation Trip\" tour was Comes With the Fall, featuring Alice in Chains' future co-lead vocalist, William DuVall.\n\nNot long after the April 1998 release of Cantrell's solo debut, \"Boggy Depot\", he began work on a sophomore record which he confidently projected for a mid-'99 release. The majority of this follow-up, later entitled \"Degradation Trip\", was written in the seclusion of a house in the Cascade Mountains. In a state of self-imposed isolation, Cantrell recorded the demos using a four-track recorder and a Gibson Les Paul. In 2002, he detailed the experience of writing the album and its outcome:\n\nAmidst writing a surplus of material between fall 1998 and spring '99, Cantrell showed two of his new songs to Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who had been living in seclusion for some time prior and had not worked with Cantrell in some time. Staley contributed to the songs which would become \"Get Born Again,\" a single from \"\", and the song \"Died\". Thus, rather than becoming Cantrell's solo work, this led to their recording by Alice in Chains in 1998, release the following year, and the esteem of being what would years later be recognized as the final material written by the band with Staley.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on the album in a 2018 interview with Billboard magazine, Cantrell said:\n\nBy April 2000, Cantrell already had over 30 songs written, so he put aside his confinement and began to search for a band to begin the recording process of \"Degradation Trip\". To continue developing his second solo album, Cantrell enlisted drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Robert Trujillo of Ozzy Osbourne (and later Metallica). The choice would deliberately refrain Cantrell from his Alice in Chains bandmates and therefore distinguish his solo career from his past. He originally booked studio time with Dave Jerden, who produced Alice in Chains' first two albums; however, Cantrell fired him after two days, claiming \"It was just not working out personally... Mike and Robert had hooked up with me and we had been through rehearsals, and we got into the studio with Dave and it all blew up on us on the second day. It took us months to get regrouped again.\" Cantrell was unable to find a replacement for Jerden and decided to self-produce \"Degradation Trip\" with his friend Jeff Tomei. They waited another three months for Bordin and Trujillo to become available again, but Cantrell found himself losing Columbia Records' approval of the project. As soon as recording began, his contract with Sony, parent to Columbia, had ended, leaving him with staggering studio bills. He continued financing it on his own, even mortgaging his house to do so, and developed the album to its completion without label interference. Cantrell reflected in early 2002 on his time making a record without a label: \n\nTrujillo noted the difficulty in re-recording Cantrell's \"little hoodrat demos.\" He was asked to replicate the demo arrangements which were on cassette and, according to Trujillo, had nearly indistinguishable bass. It resulted that Trujillo, inspired by Pino Palladino, developed his own code for writing down bass compositions which he would continue using in the future. However, he remarked positively on his recording experience with Cantrell: \"I was primarily just there to enhance the bass, but he taught me a lot about simplicity and using space and notes that really mean something to a song.\"\n\nFinally, he was picked up by Roadrunner who insisted Cantrell narrow his solo work to 14 songs. He was told, however, that the remaining tracks would later be released in some form. Indeed, on November 26, 2002, a second version of the album – considered to be the \"definitive\" and originally intended version – was released. This limited edition double album includes 11 additional recordings that Roadrunner forced Cantrell to cut, in fear that a double album would have low commercial viability. As such, Cantrell has called the single-disc release the \"\"Reader's Digest\" version\" of \"Degradation Trip\".\n\nWith its aggressive, metallic approach and dark tones, \"Degradation Trip\" more easily compares to Cantrell's previous work in Alice in Chains than that of his more experimental solo debut. A hallmark of Cantrell's style, many unorthodox rhythms and time signatures are exhibited throughout the album as well as heavy use of wah-wah guitar effect and choir-like vocal harmonies.\n\nThe album's grungy heaviness is balanced, however, by moody acoustic ballads such as the somber \"Angel Eyes.\" Serene, twangy guitar riffs featured in the likes of \"Gone\" allude more to Cantrell's Southern roots.\n\nIts lyrics, often haunting and confessional, range from cynical sarcasm to explicitly morbid portrayals. Cantrell vents on the demise of his band and other personal issues with depictions of drug abuse, troubled relationships, and the rocky, hedonistic lifestyle of a musician. The album's title refers to Cantrell's self-imposed isolation and appears in \"Solitude,\" a brooding acoustic track. The lyrical impact of songs such as \"Psychotic Break,\" which also describes Cantrell's seclusion and reflects on deceased friends and family, was only prophetically magnified upon the sudden death of Layne Staley in April 2002.\n\nThe album title comes from a line in the song \"Solitude\", the fifth track from \"Degradation Trip\".\n\nThe album cover was unveiled on April 10, 2002. The artwork was designed by Pascal Brun, and the photographs were shot by Comenius Röthlisberger, both from Team Switzerland. The front cover features a green image of Cantrell's dismembered left arm lying on a green field with guitar strings wrapped around his fingers and attached to the inner side of his elbow, alluding to the movement of playing the guitar. Female body parts are featured on the booklet for each lyric, with the song title tattooed on the skin. The booklet also contains an image of Cantrell lying on the ground bare chested with his eyes and lips upside down, and a dismembered right hand with a screw replacing the index finger. Pictures of Cantrell alongside Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin complete the booklet. The back cover has a photo of Cantrell, Trujillo and Bordin in a field, and the dedicatory \"This record is dedicated to Layne Staley\" above the track listing.\n\nTwo singles were released off the album, \"Anger Rising\" and \"Angel Eyes.\" The former debuted in April 2002 and had a music video which gained the album substantial coverage on MTV2. The acoustic ballad \"Angel Eyes\" surfaced on radio in September. MTV2 also aired short segments of a primitively animated Cantrell discussing various aspects of his music and personal life. Prior to the release of \"Degradation Trip\", \"She Was My Girl\" appeared on the soundtrack for the film \"Spider-Man\" (2002).\n\nWith his album still being shopped around to labels, Jerry Cantrell began a national club tour with a show in his new hometown, San Francisco, California, in January 2001. Supported by Comes With the Fall and Swarm, he recruited M.I.R.V. guitarist Bryan Kehoe to join himself, Bordin, and Trujillo on stage. The three bands performed together from March 13 to April 5, 2001.\n\nIn May 2001, Cantrell had an accident while playing football after a concert at the Kentucky Derby and broke his left hand and had to undergo reconstructive surgery, which caused the tour to be postponed. Cantrell's first concert after the surgery was at the Key Club in West Hollywood on July 1, 2001.\n\nComes With the Fall, a young band that Cantrell admired, would continue touring with him into the following year and even participate during his sets, which included both solo work and Alice in Chains songs.\n\nIn support of his new album, Cantrell embarked on a two-month North American solo tour beginning April 20, 2001. Cantrell, who had recently signed with Roadrunner, performed at the 16th annual South by Southwest music conference in March 2002. Despite the death of Layne Staley during this time, Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, \"The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's one of those things where if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again.\" Cantrell later told Pennsylvania's \"The Times\", \"It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it. I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.\" William DuVall of Comes With the Fall (future Alice in Chains vocalist), who performed Staley's vocals during concerts, elaborated on this emotional period:\n\nCantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28, 2002 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle. Cantrell was replaced by heavy metal band Neurotica.\n\nThat summer, Cantrell toured with Nickelback, whom he had befriended at a Roadrunner Records Christmas party, and played in select cities with Creed. However, Bordin and Trujillo were occupied recording Ozzy Osbourne's latest album, forcing Comes With the Fall to both perform as Cantrell's band and open for him in October. The solo musician found himself ironically opening for bands that his previous elder group, Alice in Chains, had undeniably influenced. Regarding the tours, Cantrell expressed enthusiasm toward Nickelback, a Canadian band with high admiration for Cantrell. During some shows, Cantrell also joined Nickelback to play the Alice in Chains song \"It Ain't Like That\" together, as documented on Nickelback's \"Live at Home\" DVD. However, Cantrell also noted his annoyance toward Creed's indifference and lack of friendliness while touring with them, he said; \"Personally speaking, I had a great time with the Nickelback guys who are actually real guys and a young fuckin’ hot band, the whole vibe of being around that’s exciting. The Creed thing was a little more stale. I just didn’t find them very personable guys. I was on tour with them for fuckin’ ever and I still hadn’t even met em’. When you spend two months together, you generally find some time to fuckin’ say hello or whatever. It was really kinda weird in that respect. I’d never been on a tour that was that fuckin’ stale on a personal level\".\n\nCantrell also took part in the Canada's Edgefest. One particularly heated show forced Cantrell to swap places with Sevendust who were having trouble crossing into Canada, and postponed their slot. The sudden inconvenience led to technical problems with Cantrell's set and a rift between the two parties; his guitar shorted out early on, and he later tripped on a microphone cord before angrily ending his set early. Cantrell then gave the crowd a disparaging remark about the upcoming Sevendust. Lajon Witherspoon, frontman of Sevendust, then spoke out during their set: \"When Jerry Cantrell says fuck Sevendust, I say fuck you, Jerry Cantrell. I hope you heard me, Jerry Cantrell.\" However, Sevendust's spokesman soon after claimed that the two parties had apologized over the misunderstanding and that Cantrell was largely just upset over the technical difficulties. Further details revealed that Sevendust's bus broke down on their way to Ontario and that they waited two hours for officers to clear them to cross the border.\n\nAfter opening for Nickelback and Creed, Cantrell began a headlining tour on October 9. This included Comes With the Fall, Mad at Gravity and Udora as openers. \n\nAfter an October 23 show in Portland, Oregon, Cantrell passed out from extreme exhaustion and dehydration. This caused the cancellation of two shows in Seattle, Washington and Colorado Springs, Colorado. He continued touring on October 27.\n\n\"Degradation Trip\" was originally scheduled to be released on May 19, 2002, but the release was pushed back to June 25, and finally pushed forward to June 18.\n\nThe album debuted at No. 33 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling more than 31,000 copies. The album stayed on the top 200 for 5 weeks, and sold 100,000 copies as of December 2002.\n\nThe album received overwhelmingly positive reviews from various media and stronger enthusiasm than Cantrell's solo debut. Many critics noted that the album holds many similarities to the Alice in Chains sound while also featuring new elements. Its bleak lyrical themes also gained much attention, particularly due to the recent death of Layne Staley.\n\nMonths prior to the album's release, Jon Wienhorn of MTV declared it \"Cantrell's best and most personal outing since Alice in Chains' last stand, and in many ways the disc takes over where that band left off.\" Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that \"serious listeners and longtime fans will [...] appreciate the album as Cantrell's best record since \"Dirt\"\" and regarded Cantrell as being \"on top of [his] game\". Sandy Masuo of \"Rolling Stone\" considered it less adventurous than \"Boggy Depot\" but noted, \"There's no happy ending when all is said and done, but it's a more poetic trip than most angst merchants offer these days, and for that reason alone it's a journey worth taking.\" \"Blender\"'s J.D. Considine similarly praised Cantrell's lyrics: \"For all the overdubbed vocals and layered guitars, it’s the writing, not the arranging, that carries this album. Cantrell creates songs, not just riffs, and \"Degradation Trip\" is packed with memorable melodies and strikingly vivid lyrics.\"\n\nAlbum – Billboard (North America)\nSingles – Billboard (North America)\n\n\n"}

The process of creating a schedule is called scheduling. An effective workplace schedule balances the needs of stakeholders such as management, employees and customers.\n\nA \"daily\" schedule is usually ordered chronologically, which means the first employees working that day are listed at the top, followed by the employee who comes in next, etc. A \"weekly\" or \"monthly\" schedule is usually ordered alphabetically, employees being listed on the left hand side of a grid, with the days of the week on the top of the grid. In shift work, a schedule usually employs a recurring shift plan.\n\nA schedule is most often created by a manager. In larger operations, a human resources manager or scheduling specialist may be solely dedicated to creating and maintaining the schedule. A schedule by this definition is sometimes referred to as workflow.\n\nSoftware is often used to enable organizations to better manage staff scheduling. Organizations commonly use spreadsheet software or employee scheduling software to create and manage shifts, assignments, and employee preferences. For large organisations employee scheduling can be complex, and optimising this is framed as the Nurse scheduling problem in Operations Research. Advanced employee scheduling software also provides ways to connect with the staff, ask for their preferences and communicate the schedule to them.\n\nAn On call shift or On-call scheduling is a practice which requires employees to be available to be called onto last-minute shifts without pre-scheduling. In the United States, the practice has been opposed by labor rights groups as \"unfair and detrimental to employees.\"\n\nFlexible self-scheduling is a practice used when a manager defines scheduling needs based on demand, but allows employees to select, trade, and fill shifts themselves. Allowing schedules to be created faster, with less effort, and gives hourly employees more control over their work life. \n\n"}

It is also the seat of the Maradi Department and an Urban Commune.\n\nOriginally part of Katsina, a Hausa state, it became independent in the 19th century. From the early 19th century, Maradi was home to one of several Hausa traditional rump states, formed by rulers and nobility who fled the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate. Elements of the Katsina ruling class continued to claim the area as the seat of a Katsina state in exile ruled by the \"Sarkin Katsina Maradi\". Maradi was constrained by the more powerful Gobir exilic state to the west, the Sultanate of Damagaram based at Zinder to the east, and Sokoto to the south. The arrival of the French in 1899 saw the bloody destruction of the town by the Voulet-Chanoine Mission, but later the town recovered to become an important regional centre of commerce by the 1950s.\n\nThe expansion of the city in the first half of the 20th century was dynamic, albeit modest, with the population nearly doubling between 1911 and 1950. Up until 1945, the ancient city of Maradi was located in the valley bordering the Goulbi N'Maradi, a seasonal waterway with its source in Nigeria. The urban area, roughly circular in shape, was protected by a mud wall with four doors; the ancient city was flooded by this river at the end of the rainy season of 1945. To avoid future inundation, the French colonial administration decided then to adjust the urban layout. In the process, the city lost its traditional, irregular layout in favour of a grid system. The French sought to create cash-crop agriculture, mostly groundnuts, which increasingly made the city an important regional commercial centre. Aided by economic growth after the 1950s, Maradi experienced a demographic boom, with the population increasing from 8,661 in 1950 to 80,000 by 1983. By the time of Niger's independence in 1960, Maradi was a centre of Hausa culture, vying with the larger traditional Hausa centre of Zinder to the east.\n\nIn 2000 a riot broke out in the town by Muslim groups opposed to the staging of the Festival International de la Mode en Afrique (FIMA) in Niamey, resulting in the destruction of various buildings deemed un-Islamic, such as brothels and bars.\n\nThe city is divided into three urban municipalities: Maradi I, Maradi II and Maradi III. Maradi is centred on the \"Grand-marché\", a large daily market of wholesale, retail, and agricultural goods from across south central Niger and also the cross-border trade with Nigeria. Some of the districts in the town include Zaria and Sabon Gari in the north, and to the west Mokoya, Dan Gouleye, Bagalam, Yandaka, Maradawa, Hassao and Limantchi.\n\nAt the 2012 census, the official population of Maradi was 267,249, making it the second largest city in the country. The predominant ethnic group in the city is Hausa, with a few urbanised Fulani and Tuaregs living there as well. Various ethnic groups from Nigeria, particularly Ibo and Yoruba, can also be found in skilled trades or in small shops.\n\nThere are several large mosques in the town. There are also some Christian churches and temples, with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maradi (Catholic Church), various Protestant churches and the Assemblies of God having a presence.\n\nMaradi is the major transport trade and agricultural hub of Niger's south central Hausa region. It lies on the major east–west paved highway which crosses from Niamey in the west to Diffa in the far east. It also has an airport. Maradi has long been a merchant city, on the route north from Kano, Nigeria. This explains why one can use either the West African CFA franc (Niger's official currency) or the Nigerian Naira for currency in Maradi. The city lies in a region known for groundnut cultivation.\n\nThe Free University of Maradi was founded in 2004.\n\n\n"}

He also served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2000 to 2003. He now operates MJH Consulting, a leading consulting firm in Florida.\n\nHaridopolos received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Stetson University in History and his Master of Arts degree in History from the University of Arkansas.\n\nHaridopolos taught United States History and Political Science at Brevard Community College—now Eastern Florida State College—starting in 1993. In 1998, he co-authored the book \"10 Big Issues Facing Our Generation\" with fellow instructor Dr. Amy Hendricks. The book includes liberal and conservative viewpoints, and discusses issues such as Medicare, Medicaid, education, taxes, national defense and Social Security.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Haridopolos taught classes as an instructor at the Bob Graham Center at the University of Florida. He created an internship program for university students to work in the legislative process at the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee. Students took classes early in the morning then worked in the Governor's office, legislative offices and in different agencies or consulting firms. Students who participated in the program now work in the legislative process in Florida and around the nation.\n\nBefore being elected to the Senate, Haridopolos was a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2001 through 2003. In 2006, he was on the shortlist to run for Lieutenant Governor of Florida as the running mate of Republican nominee Charlie Crist.\n\nIn 2008, Haridopolos declined to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in Florida's 15th congressional district in order to focus on his coming role as Senate President and his goal to make the Florida Senate more conservative. Republicans gained control of the Senate in 1994. Haridopolos actively supported conservative candidates throughout the state over the last three election cycles.\n\nHaridopolos was sworn in as Senate President on November 16, 2010, for a two-year term. He presides over the largest Republican majority since Reconstruction. Before being sworn in, Haridopolos made headlines when he removed the doors from his Senate office, making a pledge to be transparent and accessible during his term as President.\n\nHaridopolos is a co-founder of the Freedom Caucus that signs Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge to \"oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes\" every year before the Legislature goes into session.\n\nHaridopolos has appeared on Fox News' \"Huckabee\" to discuss Transparency Florida, an initiative he led to put the state budget online. He has also appeared on CNN as a guest of Lou Dobbs and has been featured in \"Florida Trend\" magazine as a legislator \"...who could shape Florida politics\". He was also recently named by the Hotline as one of six \"rising stars\" among Republican state legislators.\n\nHaridopolos sought the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent U.S. Senator Bill Nelson in 2012. The \"Washington Post\" has identified Haridopolos as \"one of the state Republican Party's rising stars.\" The \"Sunshine State News\" called him \"Telegenic and energetic,…a rising star in the party, a relentless campaigner and a bona fide conservative who would draw a sharp philosophical contrast to Nelson.\" On July 18, 2011, Haridopolos released a campaign video stating that he would no longer seek the nomination for the 2012 U.S. Senate seat, effectively ending his campaign.\n\nDuring his campaign for U.S. Senate, Haridopolos out-fundraised his Republican opponents, raising a total of $3.6 million. His candidacy received a number of endorsements, including former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, US Congressman Connie Mack, CFO Jeff Atwater, and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. He suddenly dropped out of the campaign in July 2011, amid questions over his personal finances and a $75,000-a-year no-show job he was given by the University of Florida. \n\nHaridopolos became Senate President with the largest Republican majority since reconstruction.\n\nDuring his first term as Senate President, he oversaw the balancing of the state's budget which suffered a $4 billion shortfall, without raising taxes or fees. Beyond that the Senate also authorized SmartCap, a constitutional amendment that, if adopted, will place strict caps on government spending, as well as the Health Care Freedom Amendment which fights back against the government takeover of health care.\n\nThat same year, the Senate also passed more than $300 million in tax relief, including a measure that effectively eliminates the corporate income tax burden for nearly half the roughly 30,000 Florida businesses that currently pay the tax; reformed Florida's entitlement programs, including the state's pension, welfare and Medicaid systems; reformed the state's education system; tightened regulations on unauthorized sales of habit-forming drugs; and reformed the state's growth management laws.\n\nThe \"Orlando Sentinel\" called the passage of these various measures \"…some of the most conservative legislation ever passed out of the state Senate...\" \n\nDuring the 2012 Legislative Session, Haridopolos enumerated his goals. The News Service of Florida reported that \"…he [Haridopolos] said the three things he wanted to pass, aside from the two claims bills, were the governor's three big priorities: the increased K-12 education spending, the PIP auto insurance reform, and the tax cut and economic development package. Adding those three to the claims bills, he was five-for-five.\n\nIn 2010, Haridopolos began to pursue the creation of an innocence commission. The \"Orlando Sentinel\" reported that the commission \"would study Florida's disturbing practice of imprisoning innocent people.\" \n\nThe same article noted that \"…few [lawmakers], however, make lasting impacts — and life-changing differences. Right now, State Sen. Mike Haridopolos is leading a charge to make such a difference.\" Haridopolos did ultimately secure funding for the creation of the Innocence Commission.\n\nIn 2005, Haridopolos supported Wilton Dedge's claim. Dedge had been tried, convicted and wrongfully imprisoned for 22 years. He was exonerated by DNA testing in August 2004. The claim bill, which awarded Dedge $2 million in compensation, passed in the Florida Legislature during a special session in 2005.\n\nIn 2012, Haridopolos helped pass two claims bills to compensate victims of government negligence.\n\nOne was a claim for William Dillon, who had been wrongfully incarcerated for 27 years. He was exonerated after DNA testing. He was compensated $1.35 million by the Florida Legislature.\n\nThe other was for Eric Brody, who suffered catastrophic injuries after being struck by a police cruiser in 1999. He was compensated $10.75 million for ongoing medical care.\n\nAt the close of the 2012 Legislative Session, a News Service of Florida story noted that \"Two lives may be changed for the better by the cash, a long-lasting effect of Haridopolos' persistence.\"\n\nIn 2010, Haridopolos received criticism for the sudden resignation of then Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer. Haridopolos was later validated when Greer was found guilty and sentenced to eighteen months in prison for theft and money-laundering charges.\n\nHaridopolos owns and operates MJH Consulting. He has been recognized as a leading lobbyist in Florida. He is also active in the Republican Governors Association.\n\nHaridopolos is married to Dr. Stephanie Haridopolos; they have three children, Alexis, Hayden and Reagan Brooke.\n\n"}

{"id": "1957027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957027", "title": "Residents Rally", "text": "Residents Rally\n\nResidents Rally was an Australian political party, with four candidates elected to the first Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly at the 1989 Australian Capital Territory general election. Residents Rally were led by Canberra human rights barrister and lawyer, Bernard Collaery. Collaery defined the party as \"a community-based urban green party\". The Rally formed a coalition with the Liberal Party, led by Trevor Kaine, in late 1989. However, this fractious Alliance was to last for only two years before collapsing. The Rally was unsuccessful in retaining any seats at the 1992 ACT general election.\n\nIn 1989, the Australian Capital Territory was granted self-government, and elections were called for the new Legislative Assembly. While a number of local parties announced their intention to contest the elections, Residents Rally quickly emerged as one of the leading contenders. Collaery recruited eight other local identities, and while not the largest ticket, they ultimately received 9.62% of the vote. This was enough to elect four members to the Assembly - Collaery, Norm Jensen, Michael Moore and Dr Hector Kinloch, although the complex counting system meant that it took an added two months before Kinloch was confirmed as the Assembly's final member. This left them with the same numbers in the Assembly as the Liberal Party, and only one seat behind Labor. While they had not preferenced any other party, Residents Rally agreed to support a Labor government after negotiations with both major federal parties, and Labor leader Rosemary Follett became the ACT's first Chief Minister.\n\nThe four Residents Rally members were vocal in the first Assembly, and insisted that they be consulted on most issues. They set out full policies in many areas, as opposed to several of the other small parties in the ACT at the time, and attempted to build themselves into a political force. While their power in the Assembly suffered a blow when Moore clashed with Collaery and quit the party to sit as an independent in October 1989, Residents Rally still saw themselves as a player in ACT politics, and decided to make this clear.\n\nTensions between Residents Rally and the Follett Labor government had been building for some time. The two parties had clashed over planning issues, dealings with the federal government and concerns over potential interference with the judiciary, as well as the government's support for Casino Canberra - which Residents Rally had vociferously campaigned against as part of their election platform. Finally, in December 1989, a dispute over legislation dealing with pornographic videos brought the issues to climax, and Residents Rally moved a motion of no-confidence in the Follett government. They subsequently formed a coalition government with the Liberal Party and the Independents Group - three ex-members of the No Self-Government Party. The deal saw Residents Rally leader Collaery become Deputy Chief Minister, and both Jensen and Kinloch become junior ministers in the new government.\n\nTheir new role in government gave the party significant power, and they used this, most notably to prevent what they saw as inappropriate development in a number of areas around Canberra. However, this also meant making allowances to the Liberal government's agenda, and as a result, the party decided not to oppose the government's closure of several schools and the Royal Canberra Hospital, breaking some of the promises they had made before the 1989 election. These decisions once led Labor MP Paul Whalan to compare them to the Liberals' federal coalition partner, the National Party of Australia.\n\nDespite this, major differences began to emerge between the two parties, and in April 1991, Kinloch walked out of the coalition, though he remained a member of the party and continued to support Collaery's leadership. It was around this time that Kinloch announced that he would retire at the 1992 election, instead of running for re-election as previously announced. Only weeks later, on 29 May, the tensions between Residents Rally and the remainder of the coalition came to a head, and Liberal Chief Minister Trevor Kaine expelled Residents Rally from the government. They subsequently switched their support back to Labor, and Follett was once again installed as Chief Minister.\n\nWhen the ACT faced its second election in February 1992, both major federal parties used stability as a major campaign theme, pointing to the two mid-term switches of government, which are almost unheard of in Australia. The tactic was apparently well received amongst a public that seemed to be tired of Residents Rally playing a \"kingmaker\" role, and the party's vote fell to 4.56%. As a result, both remaining members, Collaery and Jensen, lost their seats. In contrast, Moore, now sitting as an independent, got an ally elected to the Assembly, and continued to hold the balance of power.\n\nAfter their crushing defeat in 1992, Residents Rally fell apart, and had ceased to exist by the 1995 election. While Moore easily held his seat until his retirement in 2001, neither Residents Rally or any of its other candidates have played any further role in ACT politics.\n"}

His bibliography consists of more than 1000 works. Several of his books on the history of Serbs, Bosnia, Yugoslavia and Herzegovina uprising are considered to be definitive works on the subject. \n\nVladimir Ćorović was born in Mostar in Herzegovina, then under Ottoman sovereignty but under Austro-Hungarian administration, to a prominent Serb Orthodox family involved in business.\n\nĆorović finished primary school and the Gymnasium in Mostar, in which he was one of many future Serb intellectuals, among whom was also his brother the novelist Svetozar Ćorović. Ćorović continued his studies at the University of Vienna in 1904, studying Slavic Archaeology, History and Philology. He was active in the Serbian academic group „Zora“. Ćorović gained a Ph.D. in 1908 with a thesis on Lukijan Mušicki, a Serbian poet from 18th century. His professors at Vienna were Vatroslav Jagić, Konstantin Jireček, and Milan Rešetar. Ćorović was to receive a golden ring from the University of Vienna as one of the top students. He refused to accept the award on account of Bosnian Crisis. In 1908 Ćorović went to Munich for specialized studies in Byzantine history and philology with Professor Karl Krumbacher.\n\nĆorović spent certain time in Bologna and Paris, exploring Old Slavic manuscripts. In a letter he noted that such job \"is both hard and not meant for everyone\". He moved to Sarajevo in September, 1909, and worked as a curator and later administrator at the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, this period started his intensive years of working. He was a contributor to many known Serbian journals, such as „Bosanska vila“, „Srpski književni glasnik“ and „Letopis Matice srpske“. Ćorović was also a secretary of the Serbian cultural society „Prosvjeta“ in Sarajevo and organizer of its annual publication (Calendar) of 1911.\n\nAfter the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28, 1914, Austro-Hungarian authorities arrested Ćorović. He was indicted in the Banja Luka process (November 3, 1915 - April 22, 1916), along with other Serbs from Austria-Hungary accused of high treason. Ćorović was first sentenced to five years, but the High court increased it to eight years because of his contribution to the Serb cultural progress through \"Prosvjeta\". The new Austro-Hungarian Emperor, Charles I of Austria, after international pressure by the Spanish king, released political prisoners in 1917 and granting them amnesty.\n\nAt the end of World War I, Ćorović moved to Zagreb, jubilant with its Croat-Serb coalition in power and the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in favour of unification with Serbia. With several Yugoslavist poets and writers (Ivo Andrić and Niko Bartulović among others) Ćorović had established the \"Književni Jug\", a literary review. In parallel, Ćorović worked closely with other Yugoslav politicians from different provinces within the Austro-Hungarian territories. Čorović was present at the solemn proclamation of the formation of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in Belgrade on December 1, 1918.\n\nDissatisfied by the treatment of the Serbian victims after the war, Ćorović wrote the \"Black Book\" (Beograd-Sarajevo, 1920), about the large-scale persecution and murders of Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nVladimir Ćorović was a Europe-wide renowned scholar. Ćorović was professor of Serbian history at the University of Belgrade since 1919, and Rector of the Belgrade University in the 1934–35 and 1935–36 academic years. Ćorović published over 1,000 works. He rarely touched upon Byzantine themes, but the Byzantine component in his professional education was very significant for the very important support for the personnel changes which, in the 1930s, brought about the advancement of Byzantine studies at the University of Belgrade. His scholarly works includes critical interpretations of Byzantine and Serbian medieval documents, studies regarding medieval historiography and various monographs devoted to the Serbian monasteries of Bosnia (Tvrdoš, Duži, Zavala) to the relations between the Serbs of Montenegro and Muslims in Albania. \n\n\"Mount Athos and Hilandar\" (\"Sveta Gora i Hilandar\") was published by the Hilandar monastic brotherhood in 1985. Ćorović did not manage to finish the work, which was untitled, due to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941.\n\nHis book on diplomatic and political history, regarding relations between Serbia and Austria-Hungary in the early twentieth century, was prevented from being distributed in 1936, after the ambassador of Nazi Germany intervened at the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry, labeling Ćorović detailed scholarly work (based on published diplomatic correspondence and unpublished sources in various languages) as alleged anti-German propaganda. For similar reasons, the first volume of diplomatic correspondence of Serbia, prepared also by Vladimir Ćorović was never officially published, again at the demand of Nazi German representatives for its allegedly anti-German attitudes.\n\nFollowing the Royal Yugoslav Government on its way to exile during the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he died in a plane crash on 12 April 1941 on Mount Olympus in Greece.\n\nRadovan Samardžić dubbed him \"the last polyhistor\" and stated that Ćorović is one of the great Serb historians.\n\nBosnian historian Boris Nilević stated that \"Ćorović had an emotional incentive but he remained impartial in his conclusions about the treated issues\".\n\nSome critics noted that in the name of Yugoslav unity Ćorović did not mention the ethnic compositions of several divisions which committed massacres and war crimes over Serb civilians in Mačva in WWI, such as predominantly Croat 42nd Home Guard Infantry Division.\n\nStreets in Belgrade and Niš are named after him.\n\n\"Vladimir Ćorović Award\" was established in his honour.\n\n\nPosthumously published:\n\n\n\n"}

The logic on a regular cardinal κ is defined by requiring the number of operands for each operator to be less than κ; then κ is strongly compact if its logic satisfies an analog of the compactness property of finitary logic.\nSpecifically, a statement which follows from some other collection of statements should also follow from some subcollection having cardinality less than κ.\n\nThe property of strong compactness may be weakened by only requiring this compactness property to hold when the original collection of statements has cardinality below a certain cardinal λ; we may then refer to λ-compactness. A cardinal is weakly compact if and only if it is κ-compact; this was the original definition of that concept.\n\nStrong compactness implies measurability, and is implied by supercompactness. Given that the relevant cardinals exist, it is consistent with ZFC either that the first measurable cardinal is strongly compact, or that the first strongly compact cardinal is supercompact; these cannot both be true, however. A measurable limit of strongly compact cardinals is strongly compact, but the least such limit is not supercompact.\n\nThe consistency strength of strong compactness is strictly above that of a Woodin cardinal. Some set theorists conjecture that existence of a strongly compact cardinal is equiconsistent with that of a supercompact cardinal. However, a proof is unlikely until a canonical inner model theory for supercompact cardinals is developed.\n\nExtendibility is a second-order analog of strong compactness.\n"}

After a demo and the cult \"Feeding On Angels\" debut album via Century Media Records in 1998, which featured Wannes Gubbels (Pentacle) on vocals and bass, Soulburn were put to rest when Asphyx returned with “On The Wings Of Inferno” (2000) with the same line-up.\n\nAnd 16 years after their debut album, SOULBURN resurfaced in their new line-up featuring the core of Eric Daniels (guitars) and Bob Bagchus (drums), teaming with Twan van Geel (Legion Of The Damned) as vocalist/bassist and Remco Kreft (Nailgun Massacre) as second guitarist to create “The Suffocating Darkness”.\nTheir second album was recorded with Harry Wijering (Harrow Productions) and mixing and mastering duties were taken over by Dan Swanö and Unisound Studios.

This song is a classic ode to the supremacy of the blackest of Metal. 'Where Splendid Corpses Are Towering Towards The Sun' ravishes straight through the high hopes of a self-proclaimed righteous people and their plastic vanity.

He was involved in two political money-related scandals: Koreagate in the 1970s, and the Oil-for-Food Program scandal of the 2000s. Park had a reputation as the \"Asian Great Gatsby\".\n\nIn 1976, Park was charged with bribing members of the U.S. Congress, using money from the South Korean government, in a successful effort to convince the United States government to keep United States troops in South Korea. In 1977, he was indicted by a U.S. District Court on thirty-six counts, including bribery, illegal campaign contributions, mail fraud, racketeering, and failure to register as an agent of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. He avoided a federal trial by testifying to the court in exchange for immunity. His testimony did not have a major impact, though it led to three members of Congress getting reprimanded, and may have convinced Speaker of the House Carl Albert not to seek re-election. One of the implicated former representatives, Otto Passman of Louisiana's 5th congressional district based about Monroe, was charged with conspiracy, bribery, acceptance of an illegal gratuity, and income tax evasion. When his trial was moved from Washington, D.C., to Monroe, Passman was quickly acquitted.\nExplained William G. Hundley, a former organized crime investigator for the U.S. Senate who attended the Passman trial:\nI went there for the trial, and I'd go into restaurants with Park, and people would get up and leave. ... I thought the prosecution presented a pretty good case. But when the defense attorney, Camille Gravel, got up to cross-examine Tongsun Park, he carried a big map of Korea. He didn't even touch the merits of the case. He identified South Korea and noted that it's right under North Korea and next to China. Then he pointed out that North Korea and China are totalitarian communist states. The jury was out less than ninety minutes, and they acquitted Passman on every charge.\n\nIn 1992, Park was approached by Samir Vincent, an Iraqi-born American who was lobbying unofficially on behalf of the Saddam Hussein regime, to try to create a program that would bypass the United Nations-approved economic sanctions of Iraq that had started in 1991. Park agreed, requesting a payment of US$10 million for his effort, to which Vincent agreed. Park served as a liaison between Vincent and then-United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, with whom Park was friendly. In late 1996, partly as a result of Park's lobbying efforts, the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program began. After 1997, when Kofi Annan became the new secretary-general, the government of Iraq dropped its ties with Park; by then Park had received about US$2 million in payments.\n\nIn 2005 Park was accused of acting as an intermediary with corrupt United Nations officials in the oil-for-food conspiracy orchestrated by Saddam Hussein. His name surfaced as part of investigations into the oil-for-food scandal. In July 2006 he was convicted in a U.S. federal court on conspiracy charges. He became the first person convicted through the oil-for-food investigation. On February 22, 2007, he was sentenced to five years in prison. He also was fined $15,000 and required to forfeit $1,200,000. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons Web site, he was released from prison on September 10, 2008. The next day, he left the United States for South Korea.\n\n\n"}

An ex-carpenter, he rose by degrees to become an architect and Surveyor in the royal Office of Works. He was influenced by the Palladian style, but never lost his provincial manner, which earned the private derision of Sir John Vanbrugh and the public scorn of Alexander Pope.\n\nHis works include Houghton Hall for Sir Robert Walpole, which was first designed by the Palladian architects Colen Campbell and William Kent. These designs were greatly altered by Ripley.\n\nHis appointment in 1715 as Labourer in Trust at the Savoy marked the beginning of his continuous rise through the Office of the King's works. In 1721 he succeeded Grinling Gibbons as \"Master Carpenter\" and in 1726 he succeeded Vanbrugh as Comptroller of the King's Works, largely to the influence of Walpole. Walpole also engineered an additional appointment as Surveyor of Greenwich Hospital which was completed by him.\n\nBuildings for the Office of Works included the Custom House (1718) and the Admiralty (1723–6), known as the Ripley Building, in London as well as the Queen Mary Block and chapel at Greenwich from 1729–1750. In 1739 he was collaborating with William Kent on designs for the New Houses of Parliament and between 1750–54 he made a great number of changes to Kent's designs for the Horse Guards.\n\nHis appointment as executant architect at Houghton was the first of a number of Walpole commissions. Here his responsibility for the applied portico and the opening of the colonnades to the garden on the west side demonstrated that he was more than a project manager. From 1725 he designed and built Wolterton Hall in Norfolk for Sir Robert's younger brother Horatio, the 1st Lord Walpole and was chiefly responsible for converting a formal park into a naturalised landscape. Until 1731 he was in charge of the major alterations at Raynham for the Townshend family.\n\nRipley was also involved in various speculative adventures, mainly in central London. In 1726 he was the original lessee of the west side of Grosvenor Square, and although his contribution there was limited to 16 Grosvenor Street he built a number of other houses in central London. Ripley was active in promoting the scheme to build Westminster Bridge and was also involved in Richard Holt's failed attempt to develop artificial stone. Nevertheless, he seems to have been an eager investor, being one of the few to make a fortune out of the South Sea Bubble.\n\nDespite the dull and sometimes ill-proportioned character of his public buildings, his pragmatic approach and undoubted skill at managing large projects ensured that Greenwich was completed and fulfilled its function. Ripley always retained a craftsman's concern for practicality. At his masterpiece at Wolterton this resulted in a building of controlled austerity which demonstrated how convenience and dignity could be achieved through subtle planning. Wolterton's ground plan anticipates those of many villas of the 1750s.\n\nOn 17 November 1737 his first wife died and on 22 April 1742 he married Miss Bucknall of Hampton, Middlesex, an heiress said to be worth £40,000. Ripley died at his house in Old Scotland Yard on 10 February 1758, aged 75, leaving three sons and four daughters.\n\nHe was buried in Hampton, but no memorial survives. A portrait by Joseph Highmore is in the National Portrait Gallery and his Mastership of the Carpenter's Company (1742–3) is commemorated by a plaque at the Guildhall, London.\n\nOne of his sons moved into a house he had designed on Streatham Common now called Ripley House, at 10 Streatham Common South.\n\n\nAxel Klausmeier: Having a great quantity of planting amongst it.

They were named after their burials, which used large quantities of ochre, normally red, to cover both the bodies of the dead and grave goods. Sometimes they are known as the Moorehead Phase of the \"Laurentian Tradition\" or the Moorehead burial tradition after Warren K. Moorehead who brought them widely to the attention of scientists. They flourished between 3000 BCE and 1000 BCE. Alternatively, they can be called by the period in which they lived, either the \"Maritime Archaic\" (emphasizing a coastal and seafaring culture) or \"Late Archaic\" (emphasizing time and leaving open the possibility of living inland seasonally), although these terms often cover the longer period from 7000 BCE to 1000 CE. Multiple hypotheses exist as to which if any later peoples might be their descendants and there is little archaeological evidence to support any hypothesis.\n\nTheir burial culture was more elaborate than any subsequent culture in the area. In the southern portion of their range, they were succeeded by the Susquehana culture which used pottery, and no evidence of their stoneworking techniques is found in that culture.\n\nThe Red Paint People lived, fished, and hunted along the coasts and rivers. Some coastal sites show evidence of year-round occupation, discrediting an older theory that these people were seasonal nomads, living the summers on the coast and the winters inland. Their diet included sea and migratory fish, shellfish, meat, berries, acorns, nuts, and roots. The Red Paint People had stone and bone tools, as well as boats capable of catching swordfish. No pottery or metal tools have been found in sites associated with this culture. Their trading range is known to have extended from Labrador to the New York side of Lake Champlain.\n\nThe graves with red paint were known as early as the 1840s, but the first scientific examination was undertaken in 1892 by Charles Willoughby of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. Willoughby exhibited a scale model of the dig at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. It caught the attention of Moorehead, who carried out more excavations and published their site reports from 1912 to the 1920s. He described the people as older than other cultures of the area. This was disputed until radiometric dating proved Moorehead correct. In the 1930s, one theory for their disappearance was that the Red Paint People had been killed by tsunamis caused by coastal subsidence. This is no longer believed.\n\n"}

All employees working in the store report to the retail/store manager. A store manager reports to a district/area or general manager.\n\nResponsibilities of a store manager include:\n\n\nA store manager must meet the monthly, quarterly, or annual sales goals, depending on the company's fiscal cycle. This involves setting individual sales goals (quotas), holding contests for employees, or offering sales promotions. The manager may also find ways to make employees more productive to meet the goals. Thus, the store manager may be forced to reduce payroll expenditures by decreasing employees' hours, or otherwise reducing operating cost. A store manager should motivate his or her team to achieve the target set for the store. A store manager should set an example for his or her subordinates to follow.\n\nThe Store manager is the store's primary key-holder and may be called to the store before, during, or after business hours in the event of an emergency. They are also responsible for the safety of all customers and employees on store premises. Store managers may be required to hold safety meetings, especially as dictated by union practices in cases where store employees belong to a union.\n\nA store manager may have several subordinates who have management-level responsibility. These employees may be called deputy managers, assistant managers, department managers, supervisors, key holders, shift leads, or leads. Sometimes members of the management team may be several grades below the store manager. One example would be store manager - deputy manager - department manager - department leads.\nA store manager has over-all responsibility for all day-to-day activity of the store. Managing & controlling staff, and planning are essential points of the store manager.\n\nThe store manager is responsible for hiring, training, and in some cases, development of employees. The manager must ensure staffing levels are adequate to effectively operate the store, and ensure employees receive training necessary for their job responsibilities. Managers may be responsible for developing employees so the company can promote employees from within and develop future leaders, potentially for employment at other locations. Store managers also have the fire powers to any under-performing or misbehaving employees. The role of store managers with regards to the other employees varies from company to company and each respective company's operating methods but in general a store manager will be required to deal with and try to solve any and all problems that may occur at any given time.\n\n"}

After becoming WWE's World Heavyweight Champion in July 2007, he became the first Indian World champion in WWE history.\n\nBefore embarking on his professional wrestling career, he was an officer for the Punjab Police. He has appeared in four Hollywood films, two Bollywood films and several television shows.\n\nRana was born to Jwala Ram and his wife Tandi Devi in a Punjabi Hindu family of the Dhiraina village of Himachal Pradesh's Sirmaur district.\n\nBeing one of the seven siblings of a poor family, he had to do odd jobs to make ends meet and suffers from acromegaly, which among other effects causes gigantism and chin protrusion. When Rana was serving as a security guard in Shimla, he caught the eye of a police officer from the neighbouring State of Punjab that\"—\"having previously helped several employees of Punjab Police to become international sportspersons\"—\"got him inducted into the Punjab Police in 1993, and (though Rana was reluctant to leave Himachal Pradesh, his brother was also offered a job in the Punjab Police) once he landed in Punjab's Jalandhar, Rana trained in the local gyms to become a wrestler and soon he got selected for specialised wrestling training in the United States.\n\nUnder the ring name Giant Singh he first became a professional wrestler for All Pro Wrestling (APW) in the United States, making his first appearance in October 2000 when teaming with Tony Jones against the West Side Playaz.\n\nWhen Rana came to San Francisco, he signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and spent eight months there, until WCW was bought by their rival promotion, World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nAs Giant Singh, he received an offer from New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) by Team 2000 leader, Masahiro Chono, along with another big man, Giant Silva. They were the tallest tag team in professional wrestling history at an average height of 7 foot 2½ inches and a combined weight of 805 pounds, teaming up for the first time at the Tokyo Dome in October when labelled as Club 7 by Chono defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi, Kenzo Suzuki, Wataru Inoue and Yutaka Yoshie in a handicap Match when Silva pinned Tanahashi and Inoue at the same time. Singh suffered his first loss in a tag team match at Wrestling World 2002 in January 2002 after Hiroyoshi Tenzan pinned him with a cradle. Singh suffered another big tag defeat during March, being pinned by Manabu Nakanishi after a German suplex pin, though his most critical loss came in August at Tokyo Nippon Budokan, when after a falling out he was pinned by Silva in a singles match.\n\nStarting in 2002, he also wrestled in the Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and the Japanese promotion All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) until 2006, when he signed with WWE.\n\nOn 2 January 2006, Rana became the first Indian professional wrestler to be signed to a contract by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He was assigned to their developmental federation, Deep South Wrestling, where he wrestled under his real name.\n\nWith Daivari as his manager, the unnamed Singh debuted on WWE television as a villain on 7 April episode of \"SmackDown!\", attacking The Undertaker and leaving him defenceless during his match with Mark Henry, thus causing a no contest ruling. The following week on \"SmackDown!\" he was introduced as The Great Khali and Daivari explained that he finally had a client who would destroy The Undertaker (after Muhammad Hassan and Mark Henry had previously failed). Khali made his in-ring debut on 21 April episode of \"SmackDown!\", defeating Funaki.\n\nOn 12 May episode of \"SmackDown!\", Khali was John Bradshaw Layfield's hand-picked opponent against World Champion Rey Mysterio (Khali had a height advantage of 21 inches and a weight advantage of 250 pounds) and defeated Mysterio in a squash match. In his match against The Undertaker at Judgment Day on 21 May, Khali defeated The Undertaker with a kick to the head after receiving some illegal help from Daivari. Khali continued on a rampage for several weeks, winning handicap matches, beating wrestlers up in a display of power and mocking The Undertaker's signature pin and victory pose.\n\nKhali then challenged The Undertaker to a Punjabi Prison match at The Great American Bash. However, Khali was not medically cleared to compete in the match and was instead replaced by Big Show, who lost the match despite Khali's interference. After he was medically cleared, Khali was challenged by The Undertaker to a Last Man Standing match at SummerSlam on 20 August. The match was moved to the \"SmackDown!\" just prior to SummerSlam and was won by The Undertaker, thus giving Khali his first definite loss in WWE.\nThe Great Khali and Daivari were moved to the ECW brand officially when they made their ECW debuts on 31 October episode of \"ECW on Sci Fi\", when Daivari defeated \"The Reject\" Shannon Moore in a very quick match. Afterwards, Moore was manhandled by Khali. Daivari continued his ECW winning streak over the next several weeks with The Great Khali usually following up the contest with a chokebomb on Daivari's opponent.

{"id": "1957129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957129", "title": "Paezan languages", "text": "Paezan languages\n\nPaezan (also Páesan, Paezano, Interandine) may be any of several hypothetical or obsolete language-family proposals of Colombia and Ecuador named after the Paez language.\n\nCurrently, Páez (Nasa Yuwe) is best considered either a language isolate or the only surviving member of an otherwise extinct language family (Adelaar & Muysken 2004, Gordon 2005, Matteson 1972, Fabre 2005). It has often been grouped with other languages in a \"Paezan\" family, but several of these proposals are based on a historical error. Even before the discovery of the error, Campbell (1997: 173) stated, \"There is no consensus upon Paezan, and opinions vary greatly\".\n\nOne of the most often repeated statements (e.g. Loukota 1968; Kaufman 1990, 1994) is the supposed connection between Páez and the extinct Panzaleo (also known as Pansaleo, Latacunga, or Quito), formerly spoken in highlands of Ecuador. However, Panzaleo is poorly documented and the evidence for this relationship is weak and may be from language contact. Thus, Panzaleo may best be considered an unclassified isolate (Adelaar & Muysken 2004: 393-397; Campbell 1997).\n\nThe Andaquí isolate (also extinct) is often connected with Páez in a Paezan grouping. Documentation is a 20-page list of words and expressions by an anonymous author published in 1928 and another word list collected in 1854 by a priest (Manuel María Albis). There are a number of similarities in vocabulary between Andaquí and Páez. In other aspects, the differences are greater.\n\nThe Coconucan languages were first grouped together with Páez by Henri Beuchat & Paul Rivet in 1910 (under a larger \"Chibchan\" family, which is considerably more inclusive than the conservative Chibchan recognized today). Curnow (1998) shows this is based on misinterpretation of a \"Moguex\" vocabulary of Douay (1888), which is a mix of Páez and Guambiano/Totoró. The error has led to subsequent classifiers (e.g. Kaufman 1990, 1994; Campbell 1997; Greenberg 1956, 1987; Tovar & Larruceau de Tovar 1984) to group Páez with Guambiano, missing the obvious identification of Coconucan as Barbacoan.\n\nMatteson's 1972 comparison of Páez and Guambiano vocabularies show just a 5.2% overlap, less than comparisons between Páez and Arawak, Quechua and Proto-Chibchan (respectively 17%, 12%, and 14%). Following linguists such as Matteson (1972), Curnow (1998), Curnow & Liddicoat (1998), and Adelaar & Muysken (2004), the Coconucan languages are now placed under Barbacoan. The question of connections between Páez, Panzaleo, and Andaquí remains open.\n\nJolkesky (2017) argues for a connection, perhaps genetic, with the Otomanguean languages of the Pacific coast of central Mexico, especially with the Zapotecan branch, and for a possible Otomanguean substratum in a couple families neighboring Paez. The proposal has not been peer-reviewed.\n\nPrior to Curnow's correction, the Paez–Coconucan \"family\" had been connected to various other families. Greenberg included Paezan in a \"Macro-Chibchan\" (or \"Chibchan–Paezan\") stock with Barbacoan, Chibchan, Chocoan, Jirajaran, and the isolates Betoi, Kamsá (Sibundoy), Yaruro, Esmeraldeño, Mochica, Cunza (Atacameño), Itonama, and Yurumanguí. Morris Swadesh's \"Paezan\" included Páez, Barbacoan, Coconucan, Andaquí, Cunza, Kapixana, and Mashubí. Kaufman's (1990, 1994) \"Macro-Páesan \"cluster\"\" proposal included \"Paesan\" (as explained above)–Barbacoan, Cunza–Kapixana, Betoi, Itonama, and Warao.\n\n\n\n"}

First published in the late 1960s, it contains information related to many aspects of women's health and sexuality, including: sexual health, sexual orientation, gender identity, birth control, abortion, pregnancy and childbirth, violence and abuse, and menopause. The most recent edition of the book was published in 2011. The book was revolutionary in that it encouraged women to celebrate their sexuality, including chapters on reproductive rights, lesbian sexuality, and sexual independence. The move towards women's active engagement with their actual sexual desires was contradicting the popular gendered myth of “women as docile, and passive,” and “men as active and aggressive” in a sexual relationship.\n\nThe book has been translated and adapted by women's groups around the world and is available in 29 languages. Sales for all the books exceed four million copies. The \"New York Times\" has called the seminal book \"America's best-selling book on all aspects of women's health\" and a \"feminist classic\".\n\nThe health seminar that inspired the booklet was organized in 1969 by Nancy Miriam Hawley at Boston's Emmanuel College. \"We weren't encouraged to ask questions, but to depend on the so-called experts,\" Hawley told \"Women's eNews\". \"Not having a say in our own health care frustrated and angered us. We didn't have the information we needed, so we decided to find it on our own.\" As a result of this goal, the book contained information intended to guide women on \"how to maneuver the American health care system, with subsections called 'The Power and Role of Male Doctors,' 'The Profit Motive in Health Care,'\" 'Women as Health Care Workers,' and 'Hospitals.'\n\nThe original writers of the book stated four main reasons for creating it. First, that personal experiences provide a valuable way to understand one's own body beyond the mere facts that experts can provide, creating an empowering learning experience. Second, this kind of learning meant that they were \"better prepared to evaluate that institutions that are supposed to meet our health needs . . .\". Third, the historical lack of self-knowledge about the female body \"had had one major consequence - pregnancy\" and through greater information, women will have more ability to make proactive choices about when to get pregnant. Fourth, information about one's body is perhaps the most essential kind of education, because \"bodies are the physical bases from which we move out into the world\". Without this basic information, women are alienated from their own body and necessarily on unequal footing with men.\n\nThe women researched and wrote up the information themselves. Wendy Sanford wrote about abortion, Jane Pincus and Ruth Bell about pregnancy, and Paula Doress and Esther Rome about postpartum depression. The 12 feminists then published their research as a 35-cent, 136-page booklet called \"Women and Their Bodies\", published in 1970 by the New England Free Press. The booklet sold 250,000 copies in New England without any formal advertising.\n\nAs a result of their success, the women formed the non-profit Boston Women's Health Book Collective (which now goes by the name Our Bodies Ourselves) and published the first 276-page \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" in 1973. The collective published it with the major publisher Simon & Schuster only on the condition that they would have complete editorial control and that nonprofit health centers could purchase copies at a significant discount. It featured first-person stories from women, and tackled many topics then regarded as taboo. Since then, over four million copies have been sold. It has been considered one of the founding events of the women's health movement in the United States.\n\nIn 2018, the group announced that due to financial pressures, it would no longer publish new print editions nor have experts update its web site with new health information.\n\nThe Boston Women's Health Book Collective, also known as the Our Bodies, Ourselves Collective, is a feminist group that created \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\". The collective formed at the peak of the women's movement in Boston.\n\nTwelve women all between the ages of 23 to 39 first attended a workshop entitled \"Women and Their Bodies\" which allowed the women to discuss together the issues they had surrounding their health. The discussion created a consciousness-raising environment, providing each woman with information that they all deal with when handling issues about their bodies. The strong discussion supplied the women with the necessary tools and ideas that lead to the creation of their book that addressed issues surrounding sexuality and abortion. They put their knowledge into an accessible format that served as a model for women who wanted to learn about themselves, communicate with doctors, and challenge the medical establishment to change and improve the health of women everywhere.\n\nReproductive justice was at the forefront during the women's liberation, causing much debate over the biological rights of women. The Equal Rights Amendment had a section specifically targeting the important issues about Reproductive justice that combines multiple reproductive rights and issues surrounding family. The strategy of the reproductive justice plank was to establish the necessary rights and access for women to gain control over their bodies. Through the passing of this legislation woman would be granted the ability to have abortions, obtain access to birth control and gain full control over their bodies. \n\nThe Boston Collective focused on these ideas to allow women the ability to understand their bodies and themselves as women. During the National Women's Conference, women from all over the country deliberated to determine the exact laws that should be put into place for women's reproductive justice. The Boston Collective work together to teach courses and create books that provide knowledge from women not only in Boston, but women across the nation. These women use their skills and knowledge to provide many women with knowledge about their lives through rhetoric that avoids describing the female reproductive system as passive, unproductive, helpless, or powerless.\n\nThe organization has also created two single-topic books. \"Our Bodies, Ourselves: Menopause\" was published in 2006, and \"Our Bodies, Ourselves: Pregnancy and Birth\" in 2008. The Boston Women's Health Book Collective earlier produced \"Changing Bodies, Changing Lives: A Book For Teens on Sex and Relationships\" and \"The New Ourselves, Growing Older: Women Aging with Knowledge and Power\".\n\nThe first book was a product of the feminist movement and could still be said to reflect its values. The personal experiences of women are taken into account and are quoted throughout, while the social and political context of women's health informs the content of the book. The book emphasizes empowerment through information and learning, specifically, information gained through women sharing their personal narratives with each other because \"by sharing our responses we can develop a base on which to be critical of what the experts tell us.\"\n\nTopics such as male-to-female and female-to-male transsexualism/transgenderism are discussed in the most recent edition and considered in a nonjudgmental manner, despite the controversy to which they have been subject within the feminist movement. The writing style of the book tends toward a familiar, inclusive tone, with the authors referring to women and themselves as a collective group.\n\nThe collective of women who initiated \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" are part of the documentary \"She's Beautiful When She's Angry\", about the founders of the modern women's movement from 1966 to 1971.\n\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the third round of the 2004 NFL Draft. He played college football at Purdue.\n\nJohnson also played for the Carolina Panthers.\n\nJohnson attended Coronado High School in Lubbock, Texas and was a three-time All-District pick, a three time All-City pick, a two time All-League pick, and as a senior, he was the District Defensive M.V.P.. Furthermore, he holds the school career record for tackles (401 ), and he was also an excellent student who graduated with a 4.0 grade point average.\n\nJohnson played collegiately at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. He played in 47 games during his career, starting 45 including 10 as a Defensive End. He recorded 345 tackles (222 individual) and 8½ sacks. He was named Honorable Mention All-Big Ten Conference in both 2002 and 2003, and was named Academic All-Big Ten team for all four years. He graduated in May 2003 with a degree in General Health Science.\n\nAfter being drafted in the third round of the 2004 NFL Draft, Johnson contributed immediately with 11 starts at linebacker while playing in all 16 games. He ended the season as the team's leader with 133 tackles, 92 of which came in the last seven games (over 13 per game). He became the third Bengals rookie to earn the tackling title, joining Takeo Spikes and James Francis. He also had six pass deflections, two sacks, a forced fumble and fumble recovery, and nine special teams tackles. His pass break-ups total was tied for the team-high for linebackers. On November 21, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Johnson totaled 20 tackles, which was the most in the season for a player and the most for a player in the Marvin Lewis-era of coaching in Cincinnati.\n\nIn his sophomore season in the league, 2005, Johnson totaled 87 total tackles on the season while playing all games on the year. Against the Baltimore Ravens, Johnson recorded five tackles and forced a fumble on tight end Todd Heap, which led to a Bengals' touchdown to put the team up 14-3 in the second quarter. In a December victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Johnson totaled 11 tackles and forced another fumble. In a December 24 contest with the Buffalo Bills, Johnson set a team-high for the season with 14 tackles.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson totaled 113 tackles on the year and also recorded his first career interception. He began the season with 8 tackles in the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. The next game, he totaled five tackles and a fourth quarter interception against the Cleveland Browns, which was his first career interception ever. The following game, Johnson totaled a team-high 12 tackles against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He then had eight tackles in consecutive games: New England and Tampa Bay. He then led the team with 11 tackles against the Baltimore Ravens, followed by a team-high 8 tackles and a forced fumble on Lorenzo Neal against the San Diego Chargers. He then finished up against the New Orleans Saints with 14 tackles, a career-high. In the following shutout against the Browns, Johnson recorded five tackles and a sack that also resulted in a fumble. In the next game against the Ravens, Johnson recorded a team-high 13 tackles. In the December contest against the Indianapolis Colts, Johnson recorded 10 tackles, which was his fifth double-digit tackle game of the season. On the December 31 game against the Steelers, Johnson recorded six tackles and a pass deflection, and also forced a Willie Parker fumble on the one yard-line to stop the Steelers' score in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe following season, 2007, Johnson won his third team tackling title with his career-high 143 tackles. His tackle total was 32 tackles ahead of the closest player, linebacker Dhani Jones. He finished the season leading the team in tackles in five games, while finishing second in another five games and was tied for the team lead with two fumble recoveries. He also had five pass deflections, fourth on the team. Johnson began the first eight games of the season at outside linebacker, but finished the second half of the season at middle linebacker due to other injuries on the team. Johnson began the season with 8 tackles against the Browns and then 7 against the Seahawks. Then against the Kansas City Chiefs, Johnson led the team with 10 tackles and also had a sack of Damon Huard. He was then second with 10 tackles against the Buffalo Bills, then led the team with 11 tackles against the Ravens. After missing most of the Tennessee game due to an injury, Johnson bounced back with consecutive 9-tackle games against the Steelers then the St. Louis Rams. He also had a third down stop for no gain on Rams' running back Steven Jackson. In the December victory over Cleveland, Johnson had a tackle on running back Jamal Lewis for no gain on a fourth down situation to add to his total of seven tackles. In the season finale against the Miami Dolphins, Johnson led the team with 11 tackles.\n\nJohnson became an unrestricted free agent in the 2008 offseason.\n\nOn March 7, 2008, Johnson signed a three-year contract with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nHe got injured in the 2008–2009 divisional game against Arizona after taking a big hit to the helmet from teammate Jon Beason, after Beason missed a tackle on Cardinals running back J. J. Arrington.\n\nJohnson signed with the Detroit Lions on March 19, 2010.\n\n"}
{"id": "1957147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957147", "title": "Supervisor", "text": "Supervisor\n\nA supervisor, or also known as foreman, boss, overseer, facilitator, monitor, area coordinator, or sometimes gaffer, is the job title of a low level management position that is primarily based on authority over a worker or charge of a workplace. A supervisor can also be one of the most senior in the staff at the place of work, such as a Professor who oversees a PhD dissertation. Supervision, on the other hand, can be performed by people without this formal title, for example by parents. The term supervisor itself can be used to refer to any personnel who have this task as part of their job description.\n\nAn employee is a supervisor if he/she has the power and authority to do the following actions (according to the Ontario Ministry of Labour):\n\nIf an employee cannot do the above, legally, he or she is probably not a supervisor, but in some other category, such as a work group leader or lead hand.\n\nA supervisor is first and foremost an overseer whose main responsibility is to ensure that a group of subordinates get out the assigned amount of production, when they are supposed to do it and within acceptable levels of quality, costs and safety.\n\nA supervisor is responsible for the productivity and actions of a small group of employees. The supervisor has several manager-like roles, responsibilities, and powers. Two of the key differences between a supervisor and a manager are (1) the supervisor does not typically have \"hire and fire\" authority, and (2) the supervisor does not have budget authority.\n\nLacking \"hire and fire\" authority means that a supervisor may not recruit the employees working in the supervisor's group nor does the supervisor have the authority to terminate an employee. The supervisor may participate in the hiring process as part of interviewing and assessing candidates, but the actual hiring authority rests in the hands of a Human Resource Manager. The supervisor may recommend to management that a particular employee be terminated and the supervisor may be the one who documents the behaviors leading to the recommendation but the actual firing authority rests in the hands of a manager.\n\nLacking budget authority means that a supervisor is provided a budget developed by management within which constraints the supervisor is expected to provide a productive environment for the employees of the supervisor's work group. A supervisor will usually have the authority to make purchases within specified limits. A supervisor is also given the power to approve work hours and other payroll issues. Normally, budget affecting requests such as travel will require not only the supervisor's approval but the approval of one or more layers of management.\n\nAs a member of management, a supervisor's main job is more concerned with orchestrating and controlling work rather than performing it directly.\n\nSupervisors are uniquely positioned through direct daily employee contact to respond to employee needs, problems, and satisfaction. Supervisors are the direct link between management and the work force and can be most effective in developing job training, safety attitudes, safe working methods and identifying unsafe acts\n\n\n\"Doing\" can take up to 70% of the time - (this varies according to the type of supervisory job - the doing involves the actual work of the department as well as the planning, controlling, scheduling, organizing, leading, etc.).\n\nSupervisors often do not require any formal education on how they are to perform their duties but are most often given on-the-job training or attend company sponsored courses. Many employers have supervisor handbooks that need to be followed. Supervisors must be aware of their legal responsibilities to ensure that their employees work safely and that the workplace that they are responsible for meets government standards.\n\nIn academia, a supervisor is a senior scientist or scholar who, along with their own responsibilities, aids and guides a postdoctoral researcher, postgraduate research student or undergraduate student in their research project; offering both moral support and scientific insight and guidance. The term is used in several countries for the doctoral advisor of a graduate student.\n\nIn colloquial British English, \"gaffer\" means a foreman, and is used as a synonym for \"boss\". In the UK, the term also commonly refers to sports coaches (football, rugby, etc.).\n\nThe term is also sometimes used colloquially to refer to an old man, an elderly rustic. The word is probably a shortening of \"godfather\", with \"\"ga\"\" from association with \"grandfather\". The female equivalent, \"gammer\", came to refer colloquially to an old lady or to a gossip. The use of \"gaffer\" in this way can be seen, for example, in J.R.R. Tolkien's character Gaffer Gamgee.\n\nIn 16th century English a \"gaffer\" was a man who was the head of any organized group of labourers. In 16th and 17th century rural England, it was used as a title slightly inferior to \"Master\", similar to \"Goodman\", and was not confined to elderly men. The chorus of a famous Australian shearer's song, \"The Backblocks' Shearer\" (also known as \"Widgegoeera Joe\"), written by W. Tully at Nimidgee, NSW (c.1900), refers to a gaffer:\n\n\nI-O psychology research on front-line supervisors suggests that supervisors with the most productive work groups have the following qualities:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1957149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957149", "title": "Princeton University Band", "text": "Princeton University Band\n\nThe Princeton University Band serves as the marching band and pep band of Princeton University. Like most other Ivy League bands, it is a scramble band. To members and fans, it is often known as the PUB (pronounced \"Pea You Bee\") or simply The Band. Many alumni refer to it as the Tiger Band.\n\nThe modern Princeton University Band was established in October 1919 when a group of undergraduate musicians decided that a regular musical presence was needed at Palmer Stadium, home of Princeton's multi-time national champion football team; however, these events were in many ways merely a reorganization of the preexisting R.O.T.C. Band that had served a much smaller role on campus several years earlier, making Princeton's Band one of the oldest of its kind in the country. Some of the band traveled to perform at the Yale Bowl for the season's only away game, beginning a long tradition of the PUB attending all football games, home and away.\n\nFor over a decade, the PUB performed on a tight budget, clad only in black sweaters with bow-ties and white pants; however, thanks to the contributions of many alumni supporters in 1936, the band was able to afford new instruments, music, and, most notably, new uniforms — black blazers with orange collars and a Princeton Band insignia on the breast pocket.\n\nIn 1937, the PUB expanded its role at Princeton by playing not only during football games, but also basketball and ice hockey. By the 1940s, they were playing at nearly all home basketball and hockey contests, as well as at several lacrosse matches and in some more formal spring concerts.\n\nThe 1950s witnessed an era of great transition for the band. Gradually, the band changed from a corps-style band to today's scramble band. Some alumni recall seeing the band scramble without spoken accompaniment as early as 1938, and records of scrambling exist as early as 1941. In 1955, the band began experimenting with comedic scripts to go along with the halftime scrambles. The first script on record was in a home opener against Rutgers University in 1955, by which time scrambling was a well-established feature of field performances. However, the band didn't entirely stop marching until the 1970s. In 1952, the band switched from black to orange-and-black plaid blazers and continued to wear the straw hats that had been introduced a year or two earlier. With this change, the band started the tradition of wearing colorful formal wear on the field — something that has since been emulated by every Ivy League band at one point or another, as well as those of Stanford, Virginia, Rutgers, and Rice. The trendsetting new uniform was even featured on the cover of the October 1955 issue of Sports Illustrated.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1981, the PUB did not miss a single football game. At 32 years and 293 games, this is one of the longest streaks in the history of college marching bands, and substantially longer than the streak of the current holder of consecutive games attended, USC's Spirit of Troy. The PUB has never missed a home game in its near-century of existence.\n\nThe PUB's halftime format has caused problems over the years. Not only have a number of institutions banned it from performing, like the United States Military Academy at West Point and, until recently, Lafayette College, but there was serious talk in the 1970s and '80s of disbanding the group at Princeton.\n\nTo placate the concerns of administrators and alumni at Princeton, the PUB hired Jack Hontz, a marching band director from Strath Haven High School in Pennsylvania, as a musical advisor. The brother of a former band member, Hontz helped the band make the most out of its musical performances and steered the band away from behavior that may have attracted the ire of the university. While very helpful, Hontz filled only a consultory role for the PUB until his death in the summer of 2017, offering advice only when it was needed and leaving all leadership and decision-making responsibilities to the students.\n\nAs Princeton football became less nationally competitive in the latter half of the 20th century, the PUB began to focus on basketball, ice hockey, and lacrosse, following many teams to NIT, ECAC-HL, and NCAA tournaments, including several national championships, since as early as 1965. From 1990 to 2000 the PUB played at over twenty NCAA tournaments alone, including the 1998 field hockey national championship.\n\nThe PUB is a recognized student organization of Princeton University and is almost entirely run by a twelve-member officer corps consisting of the President, Drum Major, Head Manager (\"Mom\"), Student Conductor (the \"SC\"), Treasurer, four Drillmasters (\"DMs\"), Alumni Coordinator and two Librarians (\"Libes\"). A professional music advisor, paid out of the band's operating fund, is the only non-student involved in directing the band.\n\nDuring the fall football season, the band performs at all Princeton home games and all away games to which it is allowed by the host institution. At each game, besides playing in the stands during pauses in the game, the band performs a pregame show and a halftime show, each of which consists of one to three songs with accompanying formations, accompanied by a humorous script. The PUB also has a repertoire of cheers which are invoked throughout the game - often mildly offensive, but amusing nonetheless.\n\nLike every other Ivy League scramble band, the PUB has a section of unusual instruments, which the PUB calls \"trash percussion.\"\n\nEvery Halloween, the band is invited to participate in the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, to which it is particularly well suited thanks to its orange and black uniforms and colorful performance techniques. The band has also made appearances in a number of other parades including the South Amboy St. Patrick's Day Parade, the Gross National Parade, and Philadelphia's Independence Day Parade.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the football season, the Band transforms into a pep band and plays in the stands at as many Princeton men's and women's hockey, basketball, and lacrosse games as possible, including some away games. The band makes an annual trip to Penn's Palestra for the Princeton-Penn game, as well as occasional trips to nearby schools such as Columbia, Yale, Brown, and even Cornell for basketball and hockey contests. As Princeton's basketball and hockey teams are often among the best in their respective conferences, the band regularly travels with the teams to post season tournaments. Other than the absence of scrambling and formations, the Band's presence at these events is much the same as at football games.\n\nAt the end of the academic year, the band remains on campus for Reunions, a three-day celebration of Princetonians past and present. Since 1936 the band has led the annual P-Rade, a parade of alumni that begins with the University President, the oldest alumnus, the band, and the 25th reunion class.\n\nThe standard full uniform of the PUB, used for football season, parades, Princeton Reunions, and other formal events, consists of black pants, white shoes, a white dress shirt with solid black tie, Italian \"boater\" hat, and the distinctive orange-and-black plaid jacket. The drum major and student director wear white pants, long-tailed dinner jackets and bow ties. The plaid wool used in the uniforms was custom manufactured and donated by a Princeton alumnus in 1952 at Bennington Mills in Vermont. As such, the band owns the exclusive rights to the particular plaid design found on the jackets.\n\nIn 2001, the band had custom orange-and-black striped rugby shirts made for use at home basketball and hockey games. Prior to this, the band wore its signature hats and jackets with blue jeans and T-shirts for winter sports, something that is still done for away and major home basketball and hockey games, lacrosse games and other spring performances today.\n\nAlso, graduating seniors find a way to adorn their beer jackets with the plaid in some fashion, making alums of the band easy to spot.\n\n2008\n\n\n2006\n\n2005\n\n2004\n\n2003\n\n2001\n\n1993\n\n1981\n\n1967\n\n1959\n\nTraditionally, the PUB ends its football pregame shows with a formation known as the \"Double-Double Rotating P.\" The formation is a large outline letter \"P\" comprising an outer loop in a \"P\" shape and a smaller inner loop forming the interior of the letter. In this formation, the PUB plays the march \"Going Back to Nassau Hall.\" When the band reaches the trio, the P itself remains stationary, but the members of the band start to move around the perimeter of the P, with the outer loop moving clockwise and the inner loop moving counterclockwise. The band plays the trio twice, and upon beginning the second time through the trio, the two loops reverse their respective directions.\n\nAt home games, this performance immediately leads into performance of The Star-Spangled Banner.\n\nAfter football victories at Princeton Stadium, the Band goes to the fountain at the Woodrow Wilson School and plays a concert from inside. Before 2012, this would occur regardless of the game's outcome if the Brown University Band were present at Princeton.\n\nAt the conclusion of each school year, the band takes a trip to White Castle and holds an eating contest. No time limits are enforced. Whoever can eat the most Slyders is named King of the Castle for that year. The top-eating girl is referred to as Queen of the Castle. Style points are awarded for some eating methods, including:\n\nThe current record holder is Kyle (jonkyleg) Goldman '19 who in 2017 ate a recorded 36 sliders in one sitting.\n\nThe Band is famous for its irreverent antics and illicit behavior. As an incentive to motivate members to maintain this tradition, the band has for many years presented several awards to its members commemorating a variety of outrageous acts:\n\n\n\nThe Band's repertoire includes dozens of other songs, principally featuring classic rock and, more recently, '90s hits.\n\nThe lyrics to the band's theme song:\n\n\"Memories of Princeton Vol 1\" - undated\n\"Princeton University Band\" - 1927\n\"Princeton Symposium of Music\" - undated (1940s)\n\"Rally Songs by the Princeton University Band\" - 1947\n\"Songs of Princeton: In Praise of Old Nassau\" - 1951\n\"Band - Tiger Tones, Boomerangs, etc.\" - 1955\n\"Going Back: The Songs of the Ivy League\" - 1960\n\"Traditional Songs of Princeton\" - 1962\n\"Princeton University Band\" (shield album) - 1978\n\"Going Back...

Proving that the PUB is forever, band members automatically become members of FOTB upon graduation. FOTB has three key functions: (1) hosting Band Reunions following the Home Big Three game and the P-Rade, (2) publishing the FOTB newsletter, and most importantly (3) providing support, both financially and in dealings with the University administration.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1957151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957151", "title": "Hong Rengan", "text": "Hong Rengan\n\nHong Rengan (; 18 February 1822 – 23 November 1864) was an important leader of the Taiping Rebellion. He was a distant cousin of the movement's founder and spiritual leader Hong Xiuquan. His position as the Prince Gan (干王) resembled the role of a Prime Minister. He is a noted figure in history because of the sweeping reforms attempted under his rule, and because of his popularity in the West.\n\nHong was born in 18 February 1822 and worked as a village teacher in Guanlubu Village, Hua County, Guangdong. Although educated, he was unable to pass the imperial examinations. He was among the first of Hong Xiuquan's converts. In 1847, he accompanied Hong Xiuquan on his trip to Guangzhou and briefly studied the Bible there with Hong Xiuquan and Issachar Jacox Roberts.\n\nDuring the early years of the rebellion, Hong was separated from the rebellion and had to flee to Hong Kong, where he met the Swedish missionary Theodore Hamberg and converted to Christianity. He helped with church work for the Basel Mission in Sheung Wan and learned much about Christianity. Hong provided Hamberg with important information on the Taiping rebellion, which Hamberg later used to write a book about the movement, \"The visions of Hung-Siu-tshuen, and origin of the Kwang-si insurrection\", published in Hong Kong in 1854.\n\nHong also served as an assistant to James Legge, working on translations of Chinese classics into English, and on the \"Chinese Serial\", the first Chinese language newspaper in Hong Kong. During this time he learned much about Western politics, economics, history, geography, astronomy and other sciences.\n\nWhen Hong Xiuquan called for his cousin Hong Rengan to come to Nanjing to help him rule, the Taiping administration was entrenched in a bitter power dispute. The powerbase of the movement had largely become split between the devout Taiping religious followers in Nanjing and the generals commanding the armies outside the city.\n\nJames Legge did not want Hong Rengan to have anything to do with the rebels because he distrusted and condemned their beliefs. When James Legge left Hong Kong for England he gave strict injunctions to Hong Rengan to remain in Hong Kong and to not join the rebel forces.\n\nHowever Hong Rengan ignored his injunction and left Hong Kong in the spring of 1858, other missionaries gave him money and promised him a stipend for his family. He disguised himself as a peddler on his way to Nanjing.\n\nBefore his arrival, a previous power struggle, sometimes known as the Tianjing incident, erupted into a battle that killed over 20,000 Nanjing residents and the East King Yang Xiuqing, who was up to that point more powerful than Hong Xiuquan himself. It was in this environment that Hong Rengan was given the second most important position in the Taiping movement; only Hong Xiuquan himself was more powerful.\n\nHong Rengan was given this position because of his education, especially his knowledge of many aspects of Western politics, art and technology, acquired during his time in Hong Kong. He also came to Nanjing with a thoroughly Protestant mindset. This was in contrast to the largely Old Testament-dominated beliefs of the Taiping founders. Hong reformed the worship and prayer services into Protestant-style ceremonies. He also discouraged the use of the word \"barbarian\" to describe Westerners. These were a few of his early reforms.\n\nHowever, most of Hong's energy was dedicated to centralizing the authority of Taiping administration and revitalizing its military successes. He advocated building railroads, gaining the support of Western powers, and building banks in the areas under Taiping rule. Because of his beliefs, Hong is sometimes noted as the first modern Chinese nationalist, and he was mentioned in early writings by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China. These ideas, along with his clearly Protestant belief system, garnered the Taiping rebellion interest in Western circles. This interest would wane as Taiping troops moved closer to Shanghai and actively enforced their ban on opium within their realm.\n\nMost of Hong Rengan's reforms were never implemented. Though he had shown strategic talent in the few campaigns he commanded, his ideas clashed with the pre-eminent military prince of the Taipings, Li Xiucheng. In a large mission to retake the upper Yangtze River, Li refused the orders of Hong and returned to Nanjing. The failure of this mission allowed Qing troops to mount a massive blockade of the Taiping area of control and eventually led to the collapse of the rebellion. Hong Rengan's rule was soon reduced to decrees endorsed by Hong Xiuquan, but they were never followed or enforced outside the city.\n\nIn 1864 Hong Xiuquan was found dead and the city of Nanjing soon fell to Qing forces. Hong Rengan and the other Taiping leaders fled the city and attempted to maintain their rule through the decrees of Hong Tianguifu, son of Hong Xiuquan. They were caught and sentenced to death. As seen in his confession before execution, Hong Rengan was the only prince of the Taiping rebellion to maintain his loyalty to the movement and never recant. He was executed in Nanchang (南昌), in Jiangxi, on 23 November 1864, shortly after the execution of the young Hong Tianguifu and Li Xiucheng.\n\n\n"}

His career spanned more than seven decades; the events he covered included the sinking of the \"Andrea Doria\" in 1956, the assassinations of JFK and Martin Luther King Jr., the Beatles' first trip to the United States, and the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11. He was one of the pioneers of United States television news and has been credited as the first reporter to have left the studio for on-the-scene \"street reporting\" at major events. Dubbed the \"Dean of New York Journalism\", Pressman's numerous awards include a Peabody and 11 Emmys, and he was considered a New York icon.\n\nPressman was born and raised in the Bronx, the son of Jewish immigrants, Benjamin Pressman (1893–1970), who was born in Austria, and Lena Rifkin Pressman, born in Russia. His father, a dentist, became a professional magician later in life; he got his start in magic by performing tricks to entertain children when he would go to schools to teach them about proper dental care. Gabe had a younger brother, Paul (1929–2003), who was a psychiatrist.\n\nPressman graduated from Morris High School. He got his start in journalism early; as a young boy of 8 or 9, he made a newspaper for his family, with cheeky headlines such as \"Grandma's Spongecake Made With Real Sponges\". Later he worked as a cub reporter for the \"Peekskill Evening Star\" in Peekskill during the summers.\n\nHe attended New York University, majoring in History and Government, but his education was interrupted during World War II. At 19, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served from 1943–46. He took part in the Philippines Campaign while serving as a communications officer aboard the submarine chaser USS \"PC-470\" in the South Pacific.\n\nAfter the war, Pressman resumed his education, graduating from NYU with a bachelor's degree in 1946, and from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism the following year.\n\nAfter earning his master's degree from Columbia in 1947, Pressman worked for a short period as a journalist for the \"Newark Evening News\". Columbia then awarded him a Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship, and he spent the next 15 months in Europe as a freelance journalist, contributing feature stories for various outlets, including the Overseas News Agency (a subsidiary of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency). In 1948, he was briefly arrested in Berlin while in the Soviet sector of the city, in what was reported to be a sign of increasing hostilities from the Soviet government toward the west. He was headed to the Polish Consulate Berlin when he was detained, but was released two hours later.\n\nAmong the events he covered in Europe was the 1949 show trial of Cardinal József Mindszenty, who opposed the communist regime of the new Hungarian People's Republic, which Pressman covered for \"The New York Times\" and for Edward R. Murrow's radio program.\n\nPressman worked for various New York City newspapers after his return from Europe before becoming a reporter in 1954 for what then was NBC's radio station WNBC, and moved over to television in 1956. Pressman spent the bulk of his broadcast career with NBC. The exception was a seven-year period from 1972 through 1979 when he reported for what was then the Metromedia station, WNEW-TV, Channel 5 (now WNYW). Since 1945, Pressman covered the lives of 10 New York City mayors, 10 New York State governors, 15 Senators from New York, and 13 United States Presidents.\n\nPressman, who described himself as \"just a little Jewish guy from the Bronx\", became a fixture of New York City. Journalist Robert D. McFadden wrote of Pressman, \"A profound, matinee-idol anchorman he was not. But to generations of mayors, governors and ordinary New Yorkers, he was Gabe: the short, rumpled, pushy guy from Channel 4 who seemed always on the scene, elbowing his way to the front and jabbing his microphone in the face of a witness or a big shot.\"\n\nPressman pioneered street reporting as the first television journalist to do live and on-scene coverage of events. After President Kennedy was shot on November 22, 1963, Pressman went out on the street to interview New Yorkers for their reactions; he was live among a crowd of people listening to NBC Radio when the news came that Kennedy had died. Later that evening he reported from darkened Times Square and interviewed a New York City patrolman about the somber mood in the area. \n\nPressman was co-anchor (with Bill Ryan) of New York's first early-evening half-hour newscast, the \"Pressman-Ryan Report,\" born out of a devastating 1963 New York City-area newspaper strike. He covered the New York region for NBC News, WNBC-TV and WNBC-AM radio. He was sent by the network to report on many historic events, including the 1956 sinking of the \"Andrea Doria\", Elvis Presley's Army stint which went through Brooklyn, one-on-one interviews with Marilyn Monroe, Harry S. Truman and Fidel Castro, the 1964 arrival of the Beatles at Kennedy Airport, the assassination of Malcolm X, chasing after newly inaugurated New York mayor John Lindsay in the streets during the 1966 transit strike, the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where he reported on the clashes between demonstrators and police, and the aftermath of the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Pressman was a reporter for NBC News at the Woodstock festival in upstate New York in 1969.\n\nPressman has been credited with helping create the New York City institution known as the \"perp walk,\" which was born in the 1970s when he clashed with famed District Attorney Robert Morgenthau over access to filming notable suspects after they had been arrested. Morgenthau recalled, \"Gabe said, 'We need pictures to report your cases,' and I said, 'You're breaking my heart.'\"\n\nHis reputation as an intrepid reporter is the subject of a gentle lampoon on a recording of Bob and Ray (\"The Two and Only,\" Columbia Records, ca. 1970). A reporter billed as \"Gabe Pressman\" was played by actor J.D. Cullum in Billy Crystal's HBO film \"61*\", reporting unfavorably on the baseball exploits of Roger Maris (played by Barry Pepper).\n\nHe was a past president of the New York Press Club, from 1997 to 2000, and as head of that organization fought for the rights of New York's journalists, both print and electronic.\n\nUp until the time of his death in June 2017, Pressman still worked part-time at WNBC, mostly as a blog writer about New York City news on the station's website, and he was active on Twitter. In 2014, he stated that it was an arthritic knee that kept him from chasing stories like he used to. A few months before his death, he covered the 255th annual Saint Patrick's Day Parade in New York, which reportedly was the last time Pressman was on-air.\n\nPressman was married to Emma Mae Kracht from 1953 until their divorce in 1967. They had a son and two daughters. In 1972, he married Vera Elisabeth Olsen, a psychotherapist, with whom he had another son.\n\nPressman died at Mount Sinai Hospital Manhattan on June 23, 2017, aged 93.\n\nPressman amassed many awards for his work, including multiple Emmys and a Peabody Award. He won many of those awards for his coverage of the plight of New York City's homeless population.\n\n\n"}

Barrie play \"The Admirable Crichton\".\n\nA previous version was filmed the year before in England as \"The Admirable Crichton\".\n\nThe film centers on the relationship between Lady Mary Loam (Swanson), a British aristocrat, and her butler, Crichton (Meighan). Crichton fancies a romance with Mary, but she disdains him because of his lower social class. When the two and some others are shipwrecked on a deserted island, they are left to fend for themselves in a state of nature.\n\nThe aristocrats' abilities to survive are far worse than those of Crichton, and a role reversal ensues, with the butler becoming a king among the stranded group. Crichton and Mary are about to wed on the island when the group is rescued. Upon returning to Britain, Crichton chooses not to marry Mary; instead, he asks a maid, Tweeny (who was attracted to Crichton throughout the film), to marry him, and the two move to the United States.\n\nThe film contains two famous scenes, indicative of de Mille's predilections as a filmmaker. \n\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\"Male and Female\" was released on Region 0 DVD-R by Alpha Video on January 28, 2014.\n\n\n"}

It was written by Spears, Madonna, Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, Thabiso \"Tab\" Nikhereanye, Penelope Magnet, Terius Nash and Gary O'Brien. The song was released on October 14, 2003, by Jive Records, as the lead single of \"In the Zone\". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City, Stewart and Magnet started working on the song for her. During rehearsals for the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played Madonna the track and asked her to do the song with her.\n\n\"Me Against the Music\" contains influences of hip hop and usage of funk guitars. Spears and Madonna trade lines during the verses, and Madonna sings the bridge. Lyrically, the song talks about battling the music and the pleasures of letting go on the dancefloor. The song received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Some felt it was a strong dance track of \"In the Zone\", while others referred to it as lackluster and disappointing. The song was a commercial success, peaking atop of the charts in countries such as Australia, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland and Spain, as well as the European Hot 100 Singles. It also peaked at number two in Canada, Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom, and inside the top five in many other nations. The song won the \"Hot Dance Single of the Year\" accolade at the 2004 \"Billboard\" Music Awards.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Me Against the Music\" shows Spears and Madonna playing opposites in a nightclub. A cat-and-mouse chase ensues, and Spears finds Madonna in the end, only for the latter to disappear before they kiss. The video received positive reviews from critics, who noted it as symbolic of the sexual roles between the women. Spears has performed the song in a number of live appearances including the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live, \"Saturday Night Live\", 2003 American Music Awards and \"TRL\". She has also performed remixed versions with elements of bhangra music at The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004) and The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009). Spears performed the song on her Las Vegas residency show . \"Me Against the Music\" has been sampled by Justice, while the music video was recreated by television series \"Glee\" and included an appearance by Spears.\n\nAmerican producers Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known collectively as RedZone Entertainment, presented Spears with the third song they had written and produced, \"Pop Culture Whore\". While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song \"sucked\". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to \"get in her world\", as Magnet explained, it was easier to \"actually write and know what she would and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is\". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of the song; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. American producer The-Dream became involved after Stewart proposed him to work together on the track for Spears. He explained, \"I was just getting into the business. I'm in Atlanta, driving home in a '92 Cadillac, and I get the call [...] I hung up and just screamed out joyous sounds.\" During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears \"didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason.\"\n\nWhile rehearsing for their performance at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played a finished version of \"Me Against the Music\" to Madonna. After Madonna commented that she liked the track, Spears asked her to do the song with her. RedZone then handed \"Me Against the Music\" to Madonna, who arranged and recorded her vocal additions on her own, therefore making the song a duet. Spears, who has been a Madonna fan for years, was \"beyond surprised\" when she heard Madonna's verse. She said \"I just asked her to do a little thing, but she really went there. She did a lot of stuff to it.\" Jive Records hoped \"Outrageous\" would be released as the first single from the album, but Spears pushed for \"Me Against the Music\". After she performed the song for the first time at the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live, Spears refused to answer if it was the first single from the album, but said that \"there are some surprises that are going to come up in the song that I'm really excited about.\" On September 16, 2003, it was confirmed that \"Me Against the Music\" would be released as the first single from \"In the Zone\".\n\n\"Me Against the Music\" is a dance and hip hop song with \"funky guitar riffs\" and \"rapid-fire singing\". The song features Madonna, but was constructed as a duet after she was added to the track. Spears and Madonna trade lines during the verses, and Madonna sings solo in the bridge. Stewart described the sound as \"half-rapping, half-singing\" and \"beat-driven\". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, \"Me Against the Music\" is set in a moderate dance beat, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Spears's vocal range span from the low-note of G to the high-note of B. Gavin Mueller of Stylus Magazine deemed Spears's vocals as \"sexy and sultry\" and compared them to those of Prince.\n\nIn the song, Spears and Madonna sing of the pleasures of letting go on the dancefloor, in lyrics such as \"I'm up against the speaker / Trying to take on the music / It's like a competition\". Spears explained the concept of the song as \"basically about just going to a club and letting yourself go and battling with whoever is around you and battling against the music as well.\" Magnet continued, saying, \"Like she was hearing the music and trying to out-dance the track or out-beat the drum or out-pluck the guitar. It's as if she's in the club, losing herself in the music.\" William Shaw of \"Blender\" stated Madonna's verse could be interpreted as her passing the baton to a new talent, as well as \"a taunt from the old guard to the uptight youngster.\"\n\nA number of remixes were commissioned by Jive Records, to accompany the song. The Australian CD singles included remixes by artists such Peter Rauhofer, Rishi Rich, Passengerz and Terminalhead. The US CD single also contained remixes by Trak Starz, Gabriel & Dresden, Bloodshy & Avant and Kanye West. The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix was later included in the track list of \"In the Zone\". The remix removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\" called the remix \"excellent\", noting that it is \"so frenetic you barely notice Ms. Spears and Madonna – it's odd to hear two such ubiquitous figures sounding so anonymous.\" Britney had also contacted Outkast to remix \"Me Against the Music\" but the remix was not released.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic selected \"Me Against the Music\" as one of the 'track picks' from \"In the Zone\". Caryn Ganz of \"Spin\" called the song \"a fine specimen of Britney 4.0 – a fast-paced dance anthem, all grinding percussion shuttling through a traffic jam of synths.\" Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic said that \"Aside from numerous rather awful name-dropping passages and a disappointing chorus, the track is an ideal way to open the album. It's an up-tempo dance track with a big name attached; what else could you ask for?\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine deemed it as \"arguably one of Britney's finest moments and one of her mentor's worst\". Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine said that \"Madonna vamps it up (literally – her appearance here is not Sapphic but vampiric, the wizened old crone bleeding another period of forced longevity into her career like a cruenating corpse leaking plasma backwards) on 'Me Against The Music', but can't make it a bad tune.\" Gavin Mueller, also writing for Stylus Magazine, said that the single \"benefits from a kinetic garage-inspired beat, even when a tepid Madonna threatens to spoil the fun.\"\n\nSpence D. of IGN commented, \"Initially catchy, it's ultimately forgettable other than it's the musical counterpart/fallout to/from the duo's lip lock publicity stunt on the 2003 MTV Music Video Awards.\" Jamie Gill of Yahoo! Music Radio stated that \"Madonna's appearance on the brilliantly titled but deeply dreary 'Me Against The Music' was a postmodern prank designed to make all sane listeners think 'actually, \"American Life\" was pretty good, after all.'\" While reviewing \"The Singles Collection\", Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy said that \"the only arguable weak link is the Madonna-featuring 'Me Against The Music', but in this context what once looked like a respectful passing of the baton now seems like an unconditional surrender of pop Queendom to its rightful heir.\" David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"Me Against the Music\" \"the album's coy, overly busy single\". Dorian Lynskey of \"The Guardian\" noted it as \"the only duff track\" of the album. Jon Pareles of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, \"Madonna shows up in the album's first song, 'Me Against the Music', as if endorsing Spears's foray into come-hither posing and club-land beats.\"\n\nLarry Flick from \"The Advocate\" denounced the track as an \"'Into the Groove' redux\". He added that the song \"propels the listener into Spears' collaborations with heavy-hitting producers. There's nary a hint of her pristine pop past on Kelly's hip-grinding 'Outrageous' or Perry's 'Girls & Boys'. Instead Spears swims through dark, often hip-hop hued waters with occasional forays into minor keyed electro dance terrain.\" Ali Fenwick of \"The Johns Hopkins News-Letter\" said, \"Despite bringing out the big guns in a duet with Madonna, 'Me Against The Music' is not danceable, the measure of success in any pop tune.\" Linda McGee of RTÉ.ie commented that although much of the content of \"In the Zone\" is \"catchy\", \"it is hard to see any potential singles impressing as much as 'Me Against The Music'.\" Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\" deemed it as \"an odd, overstuffed track, not so much a song as a series of party chants\". Mim Udovitch of \"Blender\" called it \"lackluster\". While ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, \"The Guardian\"s Jude Rogers placed the song at number 71, writing that \"[Madonna] is usually better when she’s striding alone. This duet with Britney is all raunch and no solid roots\".\n\nOn October 25, 2003, \"Me Against the Music\" debuted at number 50 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It was Spears 10th chart hit, as well as the first of her entries that she had co-written. \"Me Against the Music\" was incidentally Madonna's 50th chart entry, 20 years after her first appearance on the Hot 100 with \"Holiday\" the week of October 29, 1983. It was also the first song in chart history to credit Madonna as a featured artist, and her first chart entry not produced by her since \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" in 1996. On the issue dated November 29, 2003, \"Me Against the Music\" peaked at number 35. On the component charts, the song peaked at the top of Hot Dance Club Songs, becoming her first song to do so, and at number 11 on Pop Songs. It won the \"Hot Dance Single of the Year\" accolade at the 2004 \"Billboard\" Music Awards. As of June 2012, it has sold 60,000 physical copies and 281,000 digital downloads according to Nielsen Soundscan. \"Me Against the Music\" also peaked at number two on the Canadian Singles Chart.\n\nIn Australia, \"Me Against the Music\" debuted at number one on November 17, 2003, replacing Kylie Minogue's \"Slow\", and remained at the top for two weeks. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 70,000 units. On November 24, 2003, the song debuted at number 13 in New Zealand. \"Me Against the Music\" debuted in the United Kingdom at number two, on the week of November 16, 2003. It was blocked from ascending the top spot by Busted's \"Crashed the Wedding\". The song became Spears' most successful single since \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\" in April 2002. According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold 240,000 copies there. \"Me Against the Music\" also topped the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles chart for three consecutive weeks. The song topped the charts in Denmark, Hungary and Ireland; reached number two in Italy and Norway; the top five in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Czech Republic, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. \"Me Against the Music\" also charted in the top 20 of Austria and France.\n\nThe music video for \"Me Against the Music\" was filmed over three days in October 2003, at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, New York. It was directed by Paul Hunter, who revealed that the concept was setting Spears and Madonna apart, hence Spears wore a black outfit whereas Madonna sported a white suit. Kevin Tancharoen was the choreographer of the video. The vehicle used in the video, a Mazda RX-8, was autographed by Spears on the hood and auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation. In 2009, Hunter talked to MTV News about the video, saying, \"Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation. She was at her peak at that point [...] So it was a challenge to kind of bring both of the worlds together. I wanted it to be a bit of a cat-and-mouse sort of game and a little bit of a foreplay between Britney and Madonna and just sort of tease the audience.\"\n\nThe video starts with Britney parking the Mazda vehicle and going into a New York nightclub. She enters a wooden room populated with 'cool kids' flaunting pink and purple hair while taking whiffs from an oxygen tank. Madonna, who is in a room filled with men smoking cigars, observes her from television monitors throughout the club. She wears a white trouser suit and carries a cane, signifying a position of moneyed power. Her suit is also notably fitted, especially in the waistcoat, revealing\nMadonna's body to be female and not masculine. Although the areas are separated by a wall, Spears and Madonna sense their presences through extrasensory perception and dance in synchronicity. Julie Andsager in \"Sex in consumer culture\" (2006) noted that the video hints at a same-sex relationship between the two.\n\nThis is followed with Spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, and the two women dancing around a metal bedframe. Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna is nowhere to be found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane and jacket, becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power in the form of a cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws her against the wall, and Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.\n\nThe video premiered on television on \"Making the Video\" on October 21, 2003 at 23:00 EDT. Its online premiere was on Yahoo! Music. It was viewed more than 2 million times in its first five days. The video reached number one on the AOL Music Top Video chart in November 2003, with 3,356,007 million streams. In January 2004, the video topped the same chart again with 1,198,920 million streams. Jocelyn Vena of MTV said, \"It was the changing of the guard – or at least the meeting of two of the most influential pop divas of all time. [...] The superstars tantalize the audience (and each other) throughout the flirty video.\"\n\nJulie Andsager stated the 'fantasy-fulfillment' strategy of Spears continued with the Madonna kiss and the \"Me Against the Music\" video, but added that \"she has, perhaps, taken her sexuality to its extreme – for network television, at least – at the age of 22\". Laurenz Volkmann said that it showcases an entire range of different female roles between 'older' and 'younger' sign systems. Author Judith Ann Peraino commented, \"In 1963, Judy Garland presented Barbra Streisand as her protégée as songstress and gay icon; in 2003, Madonna instated Spears as her protégée in same-sex erotica and icon of polymorphous sexuality.\"\n\nSpears performed \"Me Against the Music\" for the first time at the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live on September 4, 2003 at the National Mall. She sported a shoulder-length blond wig and was dressed in black football pants, a black-and-white referee halter top and boots from Reebok. The performance segued into a medley of \"...Baby One More Time\" and \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", which included pyrotechnics. Her outfit was later auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation. On September 14, 2003, Spears played a surprise concert at Rain Nightclub in the Palms Casino Resort, and \"Me Against the Music\" was the first song in the set. On October 18, 2003, the song was performed by Spears during the twenty-ninth season of the American comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\". William Shaw of \"Blender\" stated, \"Dancing and singing, Spears is in her element. She drips song-and-dance confidence. Within a few seconds, her shiny hat falls off, sending her blond hair everywhere, but Spears doesn't miss a step. When it comes to Madonna's verse, she can't help mouthing along to the words.\" Spears opened the 2003 American Music Awards telecast with a performance of \"Me Against the Music\". She floated down on a wire from the rafters in a gold overcoat, which she quickly shed to reveal a pink bustier, black vinyl thigh-high boots and black hot pants. She was accompanied by a troupe of brightly dressed faux punk rock dancers and a dizzying set that featured shooting flames, Vegas-style neon signs and a massive video screen.\n\nIt was also performed by Spears at \"Britney Spears: In the Zone\", a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. The following day, she performed on the American music show \"TRL\" at Times Square, wearing a fedora and her signature half-shirt. \"Me Against the Music\" was also performed on American late-night show \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and American morning show \"Live with Regis and Kelly\" on November 17 and 24, 2003. She performed the song as the headliner of the Jingle Ball on December 8, 2003, at the Staples Center. The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix of \"Me Against the Music\" was performed as the encore number of 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour. It began with a system malfunction where a female voice counted down as the screens sketched Spears's outline, which then rose to reveal her at the top of a staircase. Spears wore a red ensemble, an ended the performance on the staircase where the screen is lowered. She made her exit as a shower of confetti was shot towards the audience. \"Me Against the Music\" was also performed on 2009's The Circus Starring Britney Spears, in a Bollywood-inspired group dancing routine which included mudras. Spears wore green and gold harem pants ensemble. Jim Farber of \"Daily News\" said, \"In a nod to trendiness, the shows included a mock-Bollywood dance sequence during 'Me Against The Music,' eagerly riding the 'Slumdog' gravy train.\" Spears performed the song during her Las Vegas residency show . During the performance, Spears is seen doing a dance routine with walls made of wood, which is a resemblance to the labyrinth scene from its music video.\n\nThe music video was parodied during the 2003 \"French & Saunders\" Christmas Special & on an episode of the American comedy show \"MADtv\". \"Me Against the Music\" was sampled by Justice on their tracks \"D.A.N.C.E.\" and \"Valentine\", from their debut album \"†\" (2007). The music video was recreated on the 2010 American series \"Glee\" episode \"Britney/Brittany\". The characters of Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) are put under general anesthesia during a trip to the dentist's office. They share an hallucination, in which Morris appears as Spears, whereas Rivera plays Madonna. Morris explained, \"The 'Me Against the Music' montage, it's literally copied exactly from the video, the shots and looks, but the choreography is made so much more for a dancer – none of it is from the video. [...] It's insane.\" At the end of the number, Spears replaces Santana and pins Brittany against the wall, announcing to her that she is in a fantasy. Spears applauded the cover, pointing out that it \"looks just like the original,\" and adding, \"Santana does a great Madonna impression.\" The song charted at number ninety-three in Australia, fifty-four in Canada and fifty-six in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"In the Zone\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The school is adjacent to Wakefield Elementary and Wakefield Middle schools.\n\nThe school year at Wakefield High School starts in late August and ends in early June. The class schedule, commonly referred to as \"block scheduling\", has four different classes each semester, each period being approximately ninety minutes long. This completes a course in one semester instead of one year, and provides four new classes in the second semester. Students take exams in mid January and again in early June.\n\nIn the 2009–2010, the school implemented a different type of lunch period, called \"SMART\" lunch. Instead of multiple 30 minute lunch periods, a single 55 minute period is established in which all students and staff eat lunch together. Many school clubs are held during the lunch period. Teacher-help is also implemented at this time. This \"SMART\" lunch was removed in 2016ndash;2017. This resulted in a large student uproar and dislike for the school's principal Malik Bazzell.\nDuring lunch, there is also a way for students to have \"free lunch.\" This is mostly for students who come from families of the lower class who cannot typically afford lunch every day. Although this is offered, only 18% of students at Wakefield High School take advantage of this, compared to other NC schools where there are 40% of students who utilize the free lunch program.\n\nWakefield High School offers numerous Advanced Placement (AP) courses.

(ΞΚ, also known as XK) is established as the first Asian-interest fraternity in the Southeast United States. Xi Kappa has grown to represent 4 collegiate schools in the U.S. and is still growing. Based at four institutions, Xi Kappa has become an example of how Asian Americans of different ethnicities and backgrounds can unite under the banner of brotherhood and become a positive force in today’s society.\n\nXi Kappa Fraternity, Inc. is committed to fostering individual growth through ensuring personal well-being, promoting scholarship, developing leadership skills, advocating cultural awareness, and instilling fellowship through unwavering Brotherhood.\n\nThe “Xi Kappa” tradition was created out of a desire for a difference within the Southern philosophy of “Dixie.” It began as a dream envisioned by Xi Kappa Founder, Jason Dunn, to pave a way to overcome the segregation within the Asian population as well as the American culture. As this journey began, he joined forces with 8 other Asian students at the University of Georgia in 1997, to start a Greek-based organization to break the mold for the average Asian student in the Southeast. Together, the “Xi Kappa Asian-Interest Fraternity”, was formed. These nine men, Jason Dunn, Christian Deguzman, Howard Hsu, Brian Le, Eliot Kim, Sam Kim, Phong Nguyen, Trung Pham, and Ben Wong set out to make a difference with a bond greater than just brotherhood.\n\nIn the beginning of 1998, these nine men set out to create this Asian-interest fraternity with an objective to promote the very Asian heritage that brought them together. Despite the differences of personalities and backgrounds, they bonded together to work for that common objective. These nine men challenged themselves to come together and form a brotherhood for students with the same Asian heritage and interest to bond and share their common cultural backgrounds.\n\nWith a family base of more than 30 brothers in less than 2 years, the future of Xi Kappa looked bright. Later, several brothers left to pursue their own organization with the intention of promoting the same ideals that all of the other brothers had shared. This moment in Xi Kappa history marked times with turmoil, confusion, anger, and sadness. But despite the time of low morale, the remaining brothers of Xi Kappa banned together to form a greater bond. This moment of the truth revealed the ultimate transformation, which is called “The Xi Kappa Order.” The Xi Kappa Order truly exemplifies the definition of brotherhood: Honor, Truth, Respect, Loyalty, of which even the Founders in the beginning strived for. So with a moment of turmoil, a moment of Reconstruction brought the best out of men. A true understanding of “integrity” is what the Xi Kappa Order strives to instill among all of its Brothers. So, the journey continues to bring the brotherhood to bond together in times of joy and also in times of turbulence. Enter the new beginning of Xi Kappa.\n\nXi Kappa Fraternity, Inc. strictly prohibits hazing in any form as a term or condition of membership in the organization. No chapter of Xi Kappa is allowed to partake in any form of hazing of its prospective members.\n\nHazing describes a practice that puts new members in unnecessary mental and physical harm. Regardless of the many definitions and standards of what is considered “hazing”, the National Board takes any hazing allegations very seriously, and will respond appropriately.\n\nThe Fraternal and Information Programming Group (FIPG) defines hazing as:\n\n\"Any action taken or situation created, intentionally, whether on or off fraternity premises, to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule. Such activities may include but are not limited to the following: use of alcohol, paddling in any form, creation of excessive fatigue, physical and psychological shocks, quests, treasure hunts, scavenger hunts, road trips or any other such activities carried on outside or inside of the confines of the chapter house; wearing of public apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste, engaging in public stunts and buffoonery, morally degrading or humiliating games and activities, and any other activities which are not consistent with academic achievement, fraternal law, ritual or policy or the regulations and policies of the educational institution or applicable state law.\"\n\nXi Kappa Fraternity, Inc. is proud to have The national Asian-American Pacific Islander Mental Health Association (NAAPIMHA) as our National Philanthropy. NAAPIMHA is the only national organization designed to specifically address the mental health needs of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI). NAAPIMHA’s mission is to promote the mental health and well-being of AANHPI communities. The organization advocates on behalf of AANHPI mental health issues as well as serves a forum for effective collaboration and networking between stakeholders of community-based organizations, consumers, family members, service providers, program developers, researchers, evaluators, and policy makers representing various ethnic and regional differences.

{"id": "1957211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957211", "title": "Abdul Hadi Palazzi", "text": "Abdul Hadi Palazzi\n\nAbdul Hadi Palazzi (), legally named Massimo Palazzi (born 24 January 1961) is the secretary general of the Italian Muslim Assembly, and the Khalifah for Europe of the Qadiri Sufi Order. Controversially in Muslim circles, , he not only supported Israel's right to exist but also encouraged Jews to re-settle in Hebron.\n\nPalazzi was born in Rome, Italy to an Italian Catholic father who converted to Sunni Islam and a Sunni Muslim mother of Syrian descent. After completing his secular and religious education in Rome and Cairo in 1987, he served as an Imam for the Italian Islamic Community. In addition to numerous master's degrees, Palazzi holds a Ph.D. in Islamic Sciences from the Institute for Islamic Studies and Research in Naples.\n\nHe was appointed a member of the board of directors of the Italian Muslim Association in 1989, and is now the secretary general of the Sunni Muslim Organization: Italian Muslim Assembly Since 1991, he is a director of the Cultural Institute of the Italian Islamic Community, with a program based on the development of Islamic education in Italy, refutation of fundamentalism and fanaticism, and deep involvement in inter-religious dialogue, especially with Jews and Christians, but also with Buddhists and others.\n\nIn 1997, Palazzi joined the International Council of the Root and Branch Association and his essay entitled \"\"The Jewish-Moslem Dialogue and the Question of Jerusalem\"\" was published by the Institute of the World Jewish Congress.\nHe has also been a lecturer in the Department of the History of Religion at the \"Università della Terza Età\" in Velletri, near Rome.\n\nIn 1998, Palazzi and Asher Eder (Jerusalem) co-founded the Islam-Israel Fellowship, promoting a positive Muslim attitude towards Jews and Israel based on what Palazzi believes are the authentic teachings of Muhammad as expressed in the Qur'an and the Hadith. Palazzi serves as Muslim co-chairman of the Fellowship. Eder serves as the Jewish co-chairman.\n\nIn December 2009, Palazzi visited Israel. He met with members of the Jewish community of Hebron including Noam Arnon and David Wilder and expressed sympathy for the Jewish residents. He stated that both Muslims and Jews are descendants of Abraham, who is buried at the Cave of Machpela in Hebron. He blamed \"an extremist interpretation of Islam\" as a source of conflict.\n\nPalazzi accepts Israel's sovereignty over the Holy Land, and says the Qur'an supports it as the will of God as a necessary prerequisite for the Final Judgment. He accepts Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem, if the rights of other religions are protected. He quotes the Qur'an to support Judaism's special connection to the Temple Mount. According to Palazzi, \"The most authoritative Islamic sources affirm the Temples,\". He adds that Jerusalem is sacred to Muslims because of its prior holiness to Jews and its standing as home to the biblical prophets and kings David and Solomon, all of whom he says are sacred figures also in Islam. He claims that the Qur'an \"expressly recognizes that Jerusalem plays the same role for Jews that Mecca has for Muslims\".\n\nWhen asked whether he see himself as a \"Muslim Zionist\", he replied: \"If one means a Muslim who supports the right of the Jewish people to have their own independent and sovereign State, who is solidly behind the State of Israel when it is attacked by terror and when its existence in menaced, who thinks that developing friendly relations between the Muslim nations and the State of Israel is in the interest of the Muslims and of human civilization in general, then I think that the label of Muslim Zionist is appropriate.\n\nWhen asked what the Qur'an says about the State of Israel, Palazzi replied:\n\"The Qur'an cannot deal with the State of Israel as we know it today, since that State came into existing in 1948 only, i.e., many centuries after the Qur'an itself was revealed. However, the Qur'an specifies that the Land of Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, that God Himself gave that Land to them as heritage and ordered them to live therein. It also announces that—before the end of the time—the Jewish people will come from many different countries to retake possession of that heritage of theirs. Whoever denies this actually denies the Qur'an itself. If he is not a scholar, and in good faith believes what other people say about this issue, he is an ignorant Muslim. If, on the contrary, he is informed about what the Qur'an says and openly opposes it, he ceases to be a Muslim.\n\nAccording to scholar Dina Lisnyansky, Palazzi \"created his own niche. Being born into an immigrant family, he combined the democratic rights of western Europe with a love for Islam,\" but added his Zionist mission. As a result, \"he is a radical too, but not on the radicals’ side. He is fighting everything that political Islam promotes.\" She explains, \"One of the reasons why he is not on some blacklist in Iran is the fact that he, unlike Rushdie, has never said a negative word about Islam. To extremist interpreters of the Qur’an he doesn’t say ‘you are wrong.’ He would only say: ‘You got something wrong.’ His mission, therefore, is clearly not about reinventing Islam; it is about correcting the perspective.\"\n\nPalazzi opposes the US-backed roadmap for peace on the grounds that it rewards Palestinian terrorism. He argues against calls for jihad against Israel and says there is no religious demand for Israel to give up control over Muslim holy places.\n\nIn Palazzi's view, Islam has been \"hijacked\" by the Salafist movement in Saudi Arabia, a \"radical\" reformist movement which denies the moderate understanding of the Qur'an and has taken control of Mecca and Medina. He says that oil money made a primitive and violent culture powerful on a global scale. And now, \"they are reshaping Islam in accordance with their political issues.\" \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1957218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957218", "title": "Héctor &amp; Tito", "text": "Héctor &amp; Tito\n\nHéctor & Tito were a Puerto Rican reggaeton duo famous for their song \"Ay Amor\", featuring salsa singer Víctor Manuelle, which was the group's only charted song in the United States. They are also known for their songs \"Gata Salvaje\" (featuring Daddy Yankee and Nicky Jam), \"Morena\" (featuring Glory and Don Omar) and \"Amor de Colegio\" (featuring Don Omar).\n\nHéctor & Tito started their career in the 1990s going by the name of \"Los Bambinos\" after singing with other reggaeton artists. Together, they released several albums and rose to fame in all Latin America.\n\nIn 2004, the duo announced they were separating. Since then, they have gone on with their careers separately. Although not really in a tiraera war, their friendship remained tense for a time though both have publicly reconciled in present time. The singers are now known as Héctor el Father and Tito El Bambino would go on to be two of the most successful solo acts in Latin music history. Héctor el Father retired in 2008 to become an evangelical pastor in Puerto Rico, while Tito El Bambino remains active in the music industry.\n\nEfrain Fines (Tito) and Hector Delgado were born in 1981 and 1979 respectively in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Both artists resided in the neighborhood of Parque Ecuestre and began their artistic pursuits in their teens. Hector El Father was part of the rap group \"Masters Of Funk\" alongside Rey and Julio Voltio, while Tito El Bambino recorded with various local DJs gaining an appearance in the famous reggaeton series \"The Noise vol. 5\" which was considered his big break into the music scene. Thanks to local DJs such as Chiclin and Estefano, Tito and Hector form a friendship which evolved into a duo when Hector separated from Masters Of Funk. After appearances on many compilations from local DJs and producers from Puerto Rico, the duo connect with DJ Goldy and sign to VI Music in order to prepare their first album \"Violencia Musical\". Violencia Musical was released in 1998 and became a huge commercial and critical success in Puerto Rico, selling over 100,000 copies at the time and turning the duo into one of the most popular music groups in the island.\n\nOver the course of time, the reggaeton genre gained prominence outside of Puerto Rico and despite Hector y Tito's temporary loss of popularity due to a Christian album which didn't sell well and rap battles against Rubio y Joel and Baby Rasta y Gringo which also affected their sales; by 2002 Hector y Tito won their lyrical battle against Rubio y Joel and regained their position as one of the most popular acts in Puerto Rico. This was good news for the company Universal Latino which entered in a partnership with VI Music to distribute Hector y Tito's much anticipated \"A La Reconquista\", which became one of the first widely distributed reggaeton albums during the genre's boom period of 2002-2006. Thanks to international hits such as \"Duele (Cuando El Amor Se Va)\", \"Gata Salvaje\" featuring Daddy Yankee and Nicky Jam and \"Felina\". The positive reception of these songs throughout Latin America and the United States made Hector y Tito protagonists in the expansion of the reggaeton culture alongside artists such as Don Omar, Tego Calderon and the hitmaking production duo Luny Tunes. \"A La Reconquista\" also served as a launching pad for the career of Don Omar whom was signed to Hector 'El Father' and VI Music leading to Omar writing many of the songs from the album including his featurings. \"A La Reconquista\" is recognized as one of the greatest reggaeton albums of all-time and was both a commercial and critical success winning a Billboard Latin Music Award for best Latin rap album. The live version of the album A La Reconquista \"La Historia: Live\" which includes additional live performances of some of the duo's earlier hits was certified Latin platinum by the RIAA in 2003.\n\nDue to unforeseen pressures from the unexpected success, tensions arose between the fellow artists and both decided to pursue solo ambitions amid an inamicable split. Hector changed his name from El Bambino to El Father evolving into a mafioso persona emulating his American hip hop influences such as Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur. Hector recorded many successful records and platinum albums such as \"Noches De Travesura\" feat. Divino, \"Mayor Que Yo\" featuring Varios, and his solo project \"The Bad Boy\" which was certified Latin platinum by the RIAA in 2006. Hector El Father also had partnerships for his record label \"Gold Star Music\" with Roc-A-Fella Records and Machete Music/Universal Latino recording a collaboration with Jay-Z \"Here We Go\" from \"Los Rompediscotecas\" distributed by Roc La Familia (Roc-A-Fella's Latino division). Hector El Father would retire from the music scene in 2008 to pursue his faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nTito El Bambino became one of the most popular acts in Latin music and is most well known for the pop-smash \"El Amor\" from 2009's platinum \"El Patron\" album. Tito would feature alongside many prominent Latin music acts such as Marc Anthony, Ednita Nazario, Zion y Lennox and Wisin y Yandel.\n\nTito El Bambino is currently active to present time and remains one of the most popular Latin acts in the music industry. Hector y Tito have publicly reconciled since their split in 2004.\n\n\n\n\nTito El Bambino (album discography)\n\nHector El Father (album discography)\n\nStudio albums\n\nLive albums\n\nCompilation albums\n\n"}

The Rockville Branch started at the Main Fish Market, and ran 17.5 miles (28.2 km) to Rockville, Connecticut. The branch line saw factory workers, tourists, and high school students. The interurban cars were more direct, and could hold more people than the few buses of the time. The line also serviced Piney Ridge, an amusement park located just between Broad Brook and East Windsor. Most trolley companies built parks — like Piney Ridge — to create revenue on the one day no one went to work, Sunday. Piney Ridge featured a large pipe organ, a dance floor on trolley springs, and a baseball field. The dance floor with trolley springs allowed people to ease their knees as they danced the night away. The baseball field hosted games to two major players, Babe Ruth, and Lou Gehrig. Unfortunately when the Hartford and Springfield faced financial debts, the company went out of business. Their streetcars were brought to Piney Ridge and scrapped. By 1926, the track was gone, and the Rockville Branch with it.\n\nIt would be 14 years until the Connecticut Electric Railway Association was formed and began restoring service on the line. Unlimited rides on cars are included in the admission for the day. A minimum of two different cars are run each day. Many times up to three or four cars will be rotated through during the day, giving visitors an opportunity to experience many different types of streetcars and interurbans.\n\nThe museum has a diverse collection of equipment to help tell the story of the trolley era and its impact on society. Most of the equipment is stored in one of four car barns, the Visitor Center, or the car shop. Although, there exists an outdoor storage track that is next to the car shop, it goes quite far into the woods.\n\nThe Connecticut Trolley Museum has one or more of the following cars operating for the public when the museum is open:\n\n\nIn addition, the museum is currently working on the following cars in the restoration shop:\n\n\nThe Main Hall of the Visitor Center is set up with an exhibit detailing the progression of the era and its impact on society.

Located north of Adams Morgan and west of Columbia Heights, the neighborhood was one of the most diverse in the nation, with a population of roughly equal proportions of black, Hispanic, and white residents, along with Vietnamese, Laotians, Indians, and South Korean ones.\n\nOn Sunday evening, May 5, 1991, following a Cinco de Mayo street celebration in nearby Adams Morgan, Angela Jewell, a rookie Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department police officer of African American descent tried to arrest a Salvadoran man, Daniel Enrique Gomez for disorderly conduct in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood. Witnesses disputed whether the drunken man came at her with a hunting knife, but the result was that she shot and wounded the man in the chest.\n\nA Salvadoran man was shot and left paralyzed. While he was handcuffed, crowds of youths, most in their teens and twenties, formed and started to attack the police. Around 400 youths fought running street battles with the police for several hours, late into the night. Police cars were torched and several stores looted. The District’s mayor, Sharon Pratt Dixon, told the police to hold back from making arrests for looting because she feared it would antagonize the crowd and lead to more violence. District law enforcement officials had problems massing enough riot police to control the riot because of a lack of communication equipment. Due to these problems, they had an uncoordinated response when the rioting first began. Because of this poor initial response, several police officers were left to fend for themselves as the rioters attacked them and had to wait for rescue by other officers. The violence continued until early in the morning, when the crowds began to break up because of rain.\n\nHoping to avoid a second night of rioting, city officials met with Hispanic community leaders the next day. But the meeting did little to stop the violence. By evening, even with 1,000 riot police on the streets, the rioting started again. Police fought with as many as 600 black and Hispanic youths, some with bandanas over their faces. The rioters pushed dumpsters into the streets to block traffic, looted and damaged stores, and attacked police vehicles and city transit buses, setting several on fire. Several instances of gunfire were also reported. The police responded by firing tear gas grenades at the groups of rioting youths and by making arrests. When it was obvious that the disturbance was not going to end, the mayor declared a state of emergency and put a curfew into effect. The curfew covered a four-square-mile area of the city and included not only Mount Pleasant but also the surrounding areas of Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights.\n\nBy Tuesday night, after two nights of rioting, the curfew reduced the disorder; only isolated incidents of violence and 33 arrests were reported on the third night of rioting. Hundreds of police officers descended onto the neighborhood to enforce the 7:00 pm curfew and curb violence. Although there were some reports of rock and bottle throwing, no stores were looted or fires set. Most people in the area stayed in their homes, afraid of being arrested for breaking the curfew. The riot was essentially over.\n\nBy the time the curfew was finally lifted on May 9, almost 230 people had been arrested, most of them for curfew violations. Fifty people had been injured, mostly police. Over 60 police vehicles had been either destroyed or damaged, along with 21 city transit buses. At least 31 businesses had been looted or damaged and losses to both city and private property totaled in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nMany of the new Latino immigrants to the Mount Pleasant area had come from Central America, fleeing violence and seeking work. While there had been some friction between the police and the local community due to language and cultural differences, there had been no major outbreaks of trouble. In the months leading up to the riot, increasing levels of street crime and drug-related violence had fueled racial tensions among black, Hispanic, and white residents, which the Mount Pleasant riot brought to the forefront of the city's attention.\n\nOnly 140 of the city's police officers were Hispanic, and the community's Hispanic population had perceived oppression from the police force for some time. In the time leading up to the riots, residents often complained that police were stopping Hispanics and asking them for immigration papers for petty offenses that were ignored when committed by whites. Hispanic residents cited these tensions as a major factor sparking the riots.\n\nIn the years leading up to the riots, a predominantly white group of homeowners had been pressing police to reduce public drunkenness, urination, littering, aggressive panhandling, and other quality-of-life issues in the neighborhood. At the same time the Mount Pleasant Advisory and Neighborhood Commission, a quasi-governmental neighborhood organization, blamed many of Mount Pleasant street's problems on the easy availability of alcohol and its sale to already inebriated customers. Some Black and Hispanic residents perceived these efforts to crack down on alcohol sales as an attempt to drive lower income people and the customers they served out of the neighborhood, further fueling tensions.\n\nAfter the riots, the city agreed to add more bilingual officers and 9-1-1 operators, and to station more Spanish-speaking officers in heavily Latino areas. They also agreed not to ask witnesses or crime victims about their immigration status, so that more people would feel safe in coming forward to cooperate with authorities to make the community more secure. \n\nThe United States Commission on Civil Rights transmitted a report in 1993 to the President and others based on the testimonials, research, and field investigations about the atmosphere after the riots and feelings of Latinos living in D.C. The \"Mt. Pleasant Report\" was the first volume in a series of Commission Reports on Racial and Ethnic Tensions in American Communities, Poverty, Inequality, and Discrimination. It analyzed reasons for Mt. Pleasant riots and assessed other riots, such as the 1992 Los Angeles riots, to see if there were any correlation between the two; both came from urban upheaval.\n\nThis 200-page report concluded three main issues that affected Latinos in Washington, D.C., during that time were:\n\n\nThe DC Mayor's Office of Latino Affairs since then has made some progress with the Latino community. The 2008 Performance Accountability Report showed that more Latino organizations were getting city funds, more Latino parents were taking a bigger role in the public schools, and the government was readily making information available in Spanish.\n\n"}

{"id": "1957284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957284", "title": "Toxic (song)", "text": "Toxic (song)\n\n\"Toxic\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her fourth studio album \"In the Zone\" (2003). It was written and produced by Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg (known collectively as Bloodshy & Avant), with additional writing from Cathy Dennis and Henrik Jonback. The song was released on January 13, 2004, by Jive Records, as the second single from \"In the Zone\". The song was initially offered to Kylie Minogue for her ninth studio album \"Body Language\" (2003), but she rejected it. After trying to choose between \"(I Got That) Boom Boom\" and \"Outrageous\" to be the second single from \"In the Zone\", Spears selected \"Toxic\" instead. A dance-pop and techno-pop song with elements of bhangra music, \"Toxic\" features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, and surf guitar. It is accompanied by high-pitched Bollywood strings, sampled from Lata Mangeshkar and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam's \"Tere Mere Beech Mein\" (1981), and breathy vocals. Its lyrics draw an extended metaphor of a lover as a dangerous yet addictive drug.\n\nThe song has received acclaim from music critics, deeming it the strongest track of \"In the Zone\", and praised its hook and chorus. \"Toxic\" won Spears her first Grammy Award at the 2005 ceremony in the category of Best Dance Recording. \"Toxic\" attained worldwide success, reaching the top-five in 15 countries, while topping the charts in Australia, Canada, Hungary, Ireland, Norway, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it became her fourth top-ten single, peaking at number 9. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn and features references to \"Blade Runner\", \"The Seven Year Itch\", and the films of John Woo. It portrays Spears as a secret agent in search of a vial of green liquid. After she steals it, she enters an apartment and poisons her boyfriend. The video also includes interspersed scenes of Spears naked with diamonds on her body. After Janet Jackson's Super Bowl incident, the video was considered too racy for MTV and was moved to late-night programming.\n\nSpears has performed \"Toxic\" in live appearances, including the 2004 NRJ Music Awards and three of her concert tours. It was the opening number of The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), where she sang atop a bus wearing a black catsuit; Spears also performed remixed versions of the song at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), the Femme Fatale Tour (2011) and (2013). \"Toxic\" has been covered by artists such as Mark Ronson, A Static Lullaby, Reece Mastin and Ingrid Michaelson, and in television series \"Glee\". The song has also appeared in feature films such as \"Knocked Up\", \"You Again\", and \" Pitch Perfect 3\" and television series \"Doctor Who\" and \"Chuck\". The song has been included in lists by Pitchfork, \"NME\", and \"Rolling Stone\" as one of the best songs of the decade. In June 2017, a demo for \"Toxic\" containing Spears' unedited vocals was leaked to YouTube.\n\n\"Toxic\" was written by Cathy Dennis, Henrik Jonback, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg, and Sameer Chhabra from production team Bloodshy & Avant, while produced by the latter two. The song was originally offered to Kylie Minogue for recording, but she rejected it. \"Toxic\" was recorded at Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Record Plant in Hollywood, California. The song was later mixed by Niklas Flyckt at Khabang Studios in Stockholm. In December 2003, it was announced by MTV News that after trying to choose between \"(I Got That) Boom Boom\" and \"Outrageous\" to be the second single from \"In the Zone\", Spears had selected \"Toxic\" instead. She described it as \"an upbeat song. It's really different, that's why I like it so much.\"\n\nOn June 5, 2017, Spears' demo for \"Toxic\" was leaked to YouTube. The demo contains the instrumental track, combined with Spears' original unedited vocals. Despite anticipation that the leak would confirm suspicion of Spears' natural vocals being sub-par, it received generally positive criticism.\n\n\"Toxic\" is a classic dance-pop and techno-pop song, featuring elements of bhangra music. It features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, violins, and high-pitched strings. It also contains surf guitar, that according to Caryn Ganz of \"Spin\", \"warps and struts like it's been fed into the Matrix.\" The music was also compared to the soundtracks of the \"James Bond\" film series. The hook of \"Toxic\" samples a portion of \"Tere Mere Beech Mein\", from the soundtrack of the 1981 Hindi film \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\". However, it is not lifted verbatim from the score and mixes two different sections of the piece for the introduction section; later in the song, the cut-up sample is dropped in favor of a re-recorded string arrangement to improve the quality of the melody as evidenced by the multitrack recordings available on the internet. Spears sings the song with breathy vocals. Some of the refrains were inspired by pieces of classical music, such as \"Flight of the Bumblebee\", \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\", and \"Dumky Trio\". \"NME\" described the song as presenting \"piercing strings, hip-hop beats, eastern flavour and a dangerous escapade with temptation.\"\n\nAccording to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, \"Toxic\" is composed in the key of C minor, with a tempo of 143 beats per minute. Spears's vocal range spans from the low note of F to the high note of G. Lyrically, \"Toxic\" talks about being addicted to a lover. Spears refers to her addiction in the lyrics and sings lines such as \"Too high / Can't come down / Losing my head / Spinning round and round\" in a falsetto. A reviewer from Popdust called the verse \"The most representative lyric of the song's delirious, disorienting charm.\" \"Toxic\" ends with an outro in which Spears sings the lines, \"Intoxicate me now / With your lovin' now / I think I'm ready now.\" Nick Southall of \"Stylus Magazine\" said the lyrics made Spears sound afraid of sex.\n\nThe song received widespread critical acclaim upon release. Heather Richels of \"The Paly Voice\" complimented its hook and catchiness while deeming it the most appealing song of the album. While reviewing The Onyx Hotel Tour, Pamela Sitt of \"The Seattle Times\" called it the album's strongest single. Eric Olsen of msnbc.com said the song could be the biggest hit of \"In the Zone\" while calling it \"powerfully addicting.\" Caryn Ganz of \"Spin\" commented, \"Spears hits pay dirt on 'Toxic'\". Christy Lemire of Associated Press said it was one of Spears' greatest hits and deemed it as \"insanely catchy\", saying that the chorus alone \"makes you want to forgive the \"Alias\" wannabe video that accompanies the song.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it along with \"Showdown\", \"irresistible ear candy in what is surely Britney's most ambitious, adventurous album to date\". In a separate review of Spears' greatest hits album \"\" (2004), Erlewine selected it as one of the \"track picks\" and described it as \"a delirious, intoxicating rush\". Jeffrey Epstein of \"Out\" compared the innovative sound of \"Toxic\" to Madonna's \"Vogue\".\n\nSal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that \"Toxic\" and \"(I Got That) Boom Boom\", \"find Britney dabbling in hip-hop, but it's clear her heart lies in the clubs.\" Jamie Gill of Yahoo! Music Radio commented, \"In the name of fairness, it will be noted that 'Toxic' and 'Showdown' could well have been good pop songs in the hands of any other singer than Spears.\" Joan Anderman of \"The Boston Globe\" named it \"a well-titled cascade of frantic, mechanized glissandos and dreadful canned strings that buries the album's coolest (only?) chorus under a joyless mass\". The song was ranked at number five in the 2004 Pazz & Jop poll by \"The Village Voice\". \"Toxic\" was nominated for Best Song at the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards, but lost to Outkast's \"Hey Ya!\". However, it won Best Dance Recording at the 2004 Grammy Awards, making it her first-ever won Grammy. It won Best Single at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards. Pitchfork listed the song at number three on their Top 50 Singles of 2004 list. Rob Mitchum commented that Spears \"finally, she just acted like an adult, rather than constantly reminding us she wasn't a girl anymore.\"\n\n\"Toxic\" entered at number 53 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the issue dated January 31, 2004. It became the week's \"Highest Debut\". On March 27, 2004, it peaked at number nine; it was her fourth single to reach the top-ten and became her first single to reach the top ten since \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" in 2000. \"Toxic\" also topped both the Pop Songs and Hot Dance Club Songs charts. On October 25, 2004, the song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 500,000 copies. As of March 2015, \"Toxic\" has sold 2.2 million digital downloads in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It is her fifth best-selling digital single in the country. The song also topped the Canadian Singles Chart. \"Toxic\" debuted at the top of the Australian charts on March 15, 2004, and stayed in the position for two weeks. The song received a gold certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments over 35,000 units.\n\nIn New Zealand, \"Toxic\" debuted at number 38 on the issue dated February 16, 2004, and peaked at number two on March 29, 2004. It stayed at the position the following week, held off from the top spot by Eamon's \"Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)\". On March 7, 2004, \"Toxic\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending date March 13, 2004, becoming her fourth number-one hit in the United Kingdom. In April 2004, it was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), with sales over 200,000 copies. According to The Official Charts Company, the song has sold 426,000 copies there. \"Toxic\" also peaked inside the top-ten in every country it charted. The song topped the charts in Hungary and Norway; reached the top five in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Portugal, Italy, France, Sweden and Switzerland; and the top ten in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Finland, and the Netherlands. “Toxic” is Spears' most streamed single in the US, with over 448 million streams as of May 2020.\n\nThe music video for \"Toxic\" was filmed on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was directed by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single \"Stronger\". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited \"Womanizer\" and \"Do Somethin'\". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, for which Kahn created a treatment. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops a drink on the passenger's lap. Spears said she wanted to join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the \"common man\" would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was \"not sure what I was thinking about when she told me about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it.\" The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different, strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger on whom Spears drops a drink was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut \"Torque\".\n\nFor the naked scenes, Spears cleared the set, leaving only Kahn, Blackburn, and Rushing with her to shoot the sequence. Spears also shot scenes in which she had to dance through a hallway of imaginary lasers in front of a green screen, something that Kahn deemed as \"incredible to watch\". The last few scenes of the video in which Spears murders her boyfriend, concerned Kahn, who thought they would be censored. He explained, \"the trick was to make it look pop at the same time\" and told Henderson, \"Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears?\". According to Kahn, the hint of a smile that appears on Henderson's face before Spears pours the poison into his mouth was what managed to get the shot past the censors. Although Spears was at first going to be involved in the editing process with Blackburn, she did not contact Kahn after the media scandal over her wedding in Las Vegas. \"Toxic\" was Spears's most expensive music video to that time, at the cost of $1 million.\nThe music video premiered exclusively on MTV's \"Making the Video\" on January 13, 2004. The following day, Spears appeared on \"TRL\" to premiere it on regular rotation. The video was first released on the \"In the Zone\" DVD. An alternate karaoke version featuring the diamonds scene was released on the .\n\nThe music video began with an open shot of an airplane flying and preceded by three menacing dark birds, referencing the works of Hong Kong director John Woo. Spears appears with blond hair dressed as a flight attendant, lifting the in-flight intercom as if on a phone call. After serving some of the passengers, she \"accidentally\" spills a drink into the lap of a seated male passenger; later beckoning the middle-aged, overweight, bespectacled male passenger to the bathroom and seduces him. She peels off the man's mask to reveal an attractive man (Matthew Felker) underneath it and steals a black pass from his pocket as they passionately kiss. Spears then appears, completely re-dressed, standing in a futuristic Paris, similar to the 1982 film \"Blade Runner\", and takes a ride on the back of a Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford). She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series \"Alias\". As they speed past a woman, the draft from the motorcycle lifts up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film \"The Seven Year Itch\". They also pass two women, erotically frolicking in a store window.\n\nThe video the action narrative is repeatedly inter-cut with scenes of Spears, on all fours on the floor, wearing a sheer bodysuit covered in diamonds. The look was compared to that of Kate Bush in the music video for her 1978 single, \"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\". Spears then enters Toxic Industries and gains access to a vault from which she steals a vial of green poison. As she leaves, she accidentally triggers a \"\"-style laser trap, which she evades with elaborate dance moves, including a back handspring. This scene is followed by scenes of Spears wearing a black superheroine outfit and black hair. She scales a building and enters an apartment, where her boyfriend (Henderson) is waiting. She kisses him just before pouring the poison into his mouth, killing him. Spears kisses him again and flies from the window balcony. She appears back on the plane as the flight attendant and winks to the camera. The video closes with a shot of the airplane flying off, through clouds, towards the sun, followed by five menacing screeching blackbirds, as seen at the beginning.\n\nJennifer Vineyard of MTV compared the video to Justin Timberlake's \"Cry Me a River\", saying that \"Where her real-life ex just stalked his cheating lover in his clip, [...] Spears takes a more lethal approach.\" On February 10, 2004, MTV announced that due to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy in which Janet Jackson's breast was exposed on live television, \"Toxic\" along with other five music videos would be moved from daytime to late-night programming from 10 p.m. until 6 a.m. A spokeswoman for MTV announced that \"given the particular sensitivity in the culture right now, we're erring on the side of caution for the immediate future.\" The video was nominated at the 2004 MuchMusic Video Awards in the category of Best International Artist Video, but lost to Beyoncé's \"Crazy in Love\". It was also nominated for four VMAs at the 2004 awards in the categories of Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year, but lost all of them (Rumors spread on internet forums claiming the other winners were rigged due to her non-presence that year). Corey Moss of MTV said that Spears \"remains the Susan Lucci of the VMAs.\" Visual effects supervisors Chris Watts and Bert Yukich won the category of Outstanding Visual Effects in a Music Video at the 3rd Annual Visual Effects Society Awards.\n\nIn September 2009, the music video for \"Toxic\" was voted by users of the music video website MUZU TV as the sexiest music video of all time. The video was also used on \"Life Is Pornography\", a 2005 video art by Jubal Brown. Amy Schriefer of NPR noted that in the video, Spears was no longer trying to break away from her 1990s teen pop image and style; she was comfortable and having fun, not trying to generate any type of calculated controversy. The anime music video for Spears's single \"Break the Ice\" (2008) was based on the secret agent character of \"Toxic\". The video for \"Womanizer\" (2008) was created by Spears as a sequel to \"Toxic\". In the 2010 \"Glee\" episode \"Britney/Brittany\", the character of Brittany Pierce danced in a diamond suit during a cover of \"I'm a Slave 4 U\". In a 2011 poll by \"Billboard\", the song's music video was voted the second-best music video of the 2000s, behind only Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" (2009). Jillian Mapes of \"Billboard\" wrote that Spears \"proved that she comes in every flavor [...] But the one role that stays constant through the dance-heavy clip: Sultry maneater.\" Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" music video pays homage to the red-haired look Spears sports in the \"Toxic\" music video. Many comparisons were made about the similarities.\n\nHer song \"Toxic\" is still widely credited for changing the face of dance-pop in the 2000s. It introduced an influx of electro-pop into the modern market, providing the blueprint for various smash hits. On April 15, 2020, the music video of \"Toxic\" reached 441 million views on YouTube.\n\n\"Toxic\" was performed by Spears at \"Britney Spears: In the Zone\", a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. She also performed \"Toxic\" as the headliner of the Jingle Ball on December 8, 2003, at Staples Center. It was the opening number of her set, and Spears appeared wearing a black top and a white fur cape. While the choreography was deemed as \"erotic\", Corey Moss of MTV commented that some of the effect was lost due to Spears's lip-synching and a stagehand fixing a prop during the song. On January 24, 2004, Spears opened the 2004 NRJ Music Awards with a performance of \"Toxic\". During the ceremony, she also presented the NRJ Award of Honor for the Career to Madonna. Spears performed \"Toxic\" as the opening number of 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour. Previous to the beginning of the tour, she deemed it as the song she was most excited to perform, along with \"Everytime\". After an introduction in which she briefly appeared on a large video screen, Spears took the stage standing on top of a hotel bus, wearing a tight black catsuit. She was surrounded by dancers dressed as employees and columns of LED lighting, suggesting the façade of a glitzy hotel on the Vegas Strip. MTV UK commented, \"OK, so she doesn't so much sing than mime along with Toxic, [...] But what do you expect when she's simultaneously performing a vigorous dance routine, ascending moving staircases and descending fireman poles?\".\n\n\"Toxic\" was also performed as the last song of the concert during The M+M's Tour. After \"Do Somethin'\", in which Spears wore a hot pink bra, a white fur coat, and a jean skirt, she ended the set with \"Toxic\", with four female dancers in a Shakira-like style. Following the performance, she thanked the audience and introduced her dancers. \"Toxic\" was also performed at 2009's The Circus Starring Britney Spears. Following an interlude in which the dancers showcased their individual moves, the stage was lit with green sci-fi effects, and Spears appeared over moving jungle gyms. Jerry Shriver of \"USA Today\" said that \"fan-favorite Toxic [...] succeeded because the focus was solely on the star.\" Jane Stevenson of the \"Toronto Sun\" named it one of the standout performances of the show, along with \"...Baby One More Time\" and \"Womanizer\". \"Screen\" commented, \"The high point of the show was the back to back performance of two of Britney's biggest hits, 'Toxic' and 'Baby One More Time' [\"sic\"], which had the crowd break out in wild applause.\"\n\nThe song was performed at 2011's Femme Fatale Tour. After a video intermission in which Spears finds and captures the stalker that follows her, the show continues with a martial arts-inspired remix of \"Toxic\", in which Spears wears a kimono and battles dancing ninjas. Keith Caufield of \"Billboard\" felt the performance was comparable to Madonna's \"Sky Fits Heaven\" at 2001's Drowned World Tour. Shirley Halperin of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated that \"[the] mid-tempo numbers [...] seemed to stall out quickly, where faster offerings like 'Womanizer,' 'I Wanna Go' and 'Toxic' had the sold-out crowd jumping in place and pumping their number twos in the air.\" August Brown of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"The set's only weak spots were sonic revisions of catalog staples – the Bollywood spy-flick vamp of 'Toxic' remains utterly groundbreaking and didn’t need an Ibiza-inspired revision.\". Spears performed the song during the last act from her 2013-17 Las Vegas residency . The number begins with a ballad version of \"Toxic\" and Spears is seen over a giant tree. Before the chorus begins, Spears jumps from the tree in a kind of bungee jump under a water curtain. As Spears lands in the stage, the first chords from the song starts and the performance keeps going on. In the 2016 \"Billboard\" Music Awards, it was performed as the closing song of a greatest hits medley by Spears, with brand new choreography. The song was also included in Spears's setlist for the iHeartRadio Music Festival on September 24, 2016. Spears performed the song as part of her Apple Music Festival performance in London on September 27, 2016. The song was also streamed live along with \"Work Bitch\" from Spears' final show date on December 31, 2017, on ABC's \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" to a record audience of 25.6 million. \n\n\"Toxic\" earned Spears her first Grammy at the 2005 ceremony in the category of Best Dance Recording and gained her credibility amongst critics. The song also won Most Performed Work at the 2004 Ivor Novello Awards. \"Toxic\" was ranked at number fourteen on \"Stylus Magazine\"s Top 50 Singles between 2000 and 2005. In a 2005 poll conducted by Sony Ericsson, \"Toxic\" was ranked as the world's second favorite song, only behind \"We Are the Champions\" by Queen. Over 700,000 people in 60 different countries cast their votes. The song was also included on The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born list by \"Blender\". Pitchfork listed the song on The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s. Jess Harvell commented that Spears had great pop instincts and that \"Toxic\" showed how \"Britney always had more individualist pep than her peers, important when you're dealing with steamroller productions from the mind of Max Martin.\"\n\nIn 2009, NPR included \"Toxic\" on their Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Amy Schriefer noted that the song's synths defined the sound of dance-pop for the rest of the decade while adding that it \"still sound[s] fresh and futuristic.\" \"Toxic\" was listed on several others end of the decade lists; at number forty-seven by \"NME\", forty-four by \"Rolling Stone\" and seventeen on \"The Daily Telegraph\". \"NME\" called it the soundtrack to all of the fun of the decade, from \"little girls at discos\" to \"gay clubs and hen nights.\" \"NME\" critics also ranked \"Toxic\" at number 92 on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, writing that the song \"reinvented popular dance music.\" In 2010, the song was voted in \"Rolling Stone\"'s end of the decade readers poll as the fourth-best single of the decade. \"Pitchfork\" listed the song at number three on their Top 50 Singles of 2000 list. Bill Lamb of About.com listed the song at number twenty-seven on the Top 40 Pop Songs of All Time. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters commented that \"Toxic\" is a rare kind of song that transcends genre boundaries, and added that Spears delivered the track that defined her legacy. In May 2010, Spears revealed through her Twitter account that \"Toxic\" is her favorite song from her catalogue.\n\nThe song was covered on the 2010 American series \"Glee\" episode \"Britney/Brittany\" by New Directions, in a Bob Fosse-inspired performance led by the character of Will Schuester. In the United States, their version debuted at number sixteen on the Hot 100 and sold 109,000 copies on its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It also charted at number thirty-seven in Australia, fifteen in Canada, and seventeen in Ireland. The song was covered again in \"Glee\" episode \"100\" by Dianna Agron, Heather Morris, and Naya Rivera.

On December 2, 2016, Madonna covered the song during a live concert broadcast through Facebook Live..\n\nThe song was also covered in 2019 by Scottish singer Nina Nesbitt and the Queercore band Dog Park Dissidents The song is also included in the \"Backstage Romance\" number of \"Moulin Rouge!\" (musical), where it is sung in a medley with \"Bad Romance\", \"Tainted Love\", \"Seven Nation Army\", and \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\".\n\nIn the 2005 episode \"The End of the World\" of the TV show \"Doctor Who\", the character of Cassandra unveils an ancient jukebox that reproduced \"Toxic\" as an example of \"a traditional ballad\" from about 5 billion years prior. \"NME\" stated that the inclusion of the song marked its cultural impact. In the 2007 film \"Knocked Up\", the song is played when Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd are driving to Las Vegas. Director Judd Apatow explained that he initially tried to use \"Toxic\" in the 2005 film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" in the scene where Leslie Mann is drunk driving. \"Toxic\" was also featured in the 2010 film \"You Again\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"In the Zone\".\n\nRecording and management\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n"}

The poem concerns the retirement of a well-traveled ship (referred to as a \"\"phaselus\"\", also sometimes cited as \"\"phasellus\"\", a variant spelling). Catullus draws a strong analogy with human aging, rendering the boat as a person that flies and speaks, with palms (the oars) and purpose.\n\nThe poem is complex, with numerous geographic references and elaborate litotic double negatives in a list-like manner. It borrows heavily from Ancient Greek vocabulary, and also uses Greek grammar in several sections. The meter of the poem is unusual — iambic trimeter, which was perhaps chosen to convey a sense of speed over the waves.\n\nScholars remain uncertain whether the story of the construction and voyages of this \"phasellus\" (ship, yacht, or pinnace), as described or implied in the poem, can be taken literally. Professor A. D. Hope in his posthumous book of translations from Catullus is one translator who takes it so. His introduction calls the phasellus “his yacht, in which he [Catullus] must have made the return voyage [from Bithynia]” and the translation ends \n\"Until she made landfall in this limpid lake.\" /\n\"But that was aforetime and she is laid up now . . .\" \nHowever Hope also left, in his final collection of poetry \"Aubade\", a much freer translation, adaptation, or erotic parody, in which the phasellus seems to be, in effect, a phallus. This version says that the phasellus\n\"claims that in his hey-day with mainsail and spanker\" / \"He outsailed all vessels\"; \nand the ending becomes:\n\"At his last landfall now, beyond all resurgence,\" / \n\"View him careened upon a final lee-shore;\" / \n\". . . Sing for the captain who will put to sea no more!\"\n\nAmong a number of other interpretations, Catullus 4 has also been interpreted as a parody of epic poetry, or the boat as a metaphor for the Ship of state.\n\n\n\n"}

They are overlaid by area code 917, which covers the entirety of New York City.\n\nUntil 1984, all of New York City had been served by area code 212 for 37 years. New York Telephone required a new area code to \"prevent an impending exhaustion of telephone numbers.\" On February 1, 1984, the New York Public Service Commission voted to create a new area code to serve Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, amidst protests and threats of legal action from local and state officials. Entering service on September 1, 1984, the new area code (718) was implemented so that the city's three million telephone numbers were split roughly in half. Permissive dialing of 212 continued across New York City until January 1, 1985.\n\nOn July 1, 1992, the Bronx and the neighborhood of Marble Hill, Manhattan were split from 212 and added to numbering plan area 718. A permissive dialing period for using either area code 212 or 718 in the affected area lasted until May 16, 1993.\n\nOn October 1, 1999, area code 347 was added as an overlay code to area code 718.\n\nOn December 16, 2009, the New York Public Service Commission approved an additional overlay code for the 718/347 numbering plan area. On January 22, 2010, NeuStar announced another overlay code (929) for the New York City 718 and 347 area codes of boroughs outside Manhattan. Area code 929 became effective on April 16, 2011. This had the effect of assigning 23.4 million numbers to an area of 6.7 million people.\n\nArea code 917 overlays area codes 718, 347, and 929, as well as area codes 212, 646 and 332 in Manhattan.\n\nThe 347/718/929 NPA is projected to be exhausted by 2029.\n\nDespite being legally a part of the borough of Manhattan, per the Greater New York Charter of 1897, the neighborhood Marble Hill is excluded from the Manhattan numbering plan areas 212, 646, and 332, but uses 718, 347, or 929 area codes. It used to be attached to Manhattan Island. After the Harlem River Ship Canal was built in 1895, Marble Hill was separated from Manhattan Island by water. Soon after, the Spuyten Duyvil Creek was filled in with landfill, physically connecting Marble Hill to the Bronx.\n\nWhen the 718 numbering plan area was extended to the Bronx, Marble Hill residents unsuccessfully fought to retain area code 212. Marble Hill was tributary to the Bronx central offices, and it would have been too expensive for New York Telephone to reroute the trunks to this neighborhood.\n\nThe 718 area code was celebrated in the 1998 2 Skinnee J's song \"718\", in which the rappers tell of people moving from Manhattan (212) to other boroughs (718) for lower rent.\n\nHip-hop group Theodore Unit (which includes Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah) released an album entitled \"718\", an homage to their home of Staten Island, which is contained within the 718 area code. Rapper/actor Mos Def refers to the 718 area code in his song \"Sunshine\", and in M.O.P.'s song \"Ante Up\", they mention \"repping 1–718 dangerously\".\n\n\"718\" is a track produced by DJ Premier from Jaz-O & Immobilarie album \"Kingz Kounty\".\n\nThe area code was briefly mentioned in the song \"Don't Be One\", which is part of the \"Felony\" album by American metalcore band Emmure.\n\nThe mixtape \"Return of the PLK\" contains the song titled \"718 Nigga\" by Rapper Lloyd Banks.\n\nThe FannyPack album \"See You Next Tuesday\" contains the song \"Seven One Eight\". This song was featured in the \"Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23\" episode \"Paris...\".\n\nThe area code was mentioned as part of Barney Stinson's citation of many New York area codes in the \"How I Met Your Mother\" episode \"No Tomorrow\".\n\nOn the episode of \"Seinfeld\" entitled \"The Maid,\" Elaine says that she used to be \"a 718\" which made her \"cry every night\".\n\n\"718\" was referred to in the \"Salon of the Dead\" episode of \"Gossip Girl\" as the \"slums\".\n\nIncluded in the 2001 song \"Area Codes\" as one of the many locations where rapper Ludacris has \"hoes\".\n\nA number from the +1-347 area code appears as \"Come forth and call 489-4608, and I'll be here\" in the lyrics of \"Diary\", a track on album \"The Diary of Alicia Keys\".\n\nIn \"Sex and the City\", when Carrie returns from Mexico and her personal assistant Louise procures a new cell phone number, Louise begins to tell Carrie her new phone number, beginning with the 347 area code. Carrie interrupts insisting she's a \"917 girl,\" to which Louise responds, \"Now you're a 347 girl.\"\n\nThe runner-up (but dastardly) dance group in the 2011 movie Honey 2 is called \"718\".\n\n"}

It received its charter in 1998. Part of the Grossmont Union High School District, it serves a mid-level socioeconomic community and has a student body of approximately 2,400 pupils. Helix serves parts of La Mesa, Lemon Grove, and Spring Valley; however, as a charter school, all high school students in the state of California are eligible to attend.\n\nHelix High School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and is a California Distinguished School in 2001 and 2009.\n\nHelix Charter High School opened as the second high school in the Grossmont Union High School District in September 1951, to relieve record enrollment of 3000 at Grossmont High School. In November 1950, East County voters overwhelmingly approved a local bond issue for $1.9 million that financed \"the University Avenue high school.\" Helix's first year of studies were held at Grossmont while the new campus was being built. The two schools operated on double sessions that year.\n\nHelix, receiving half of Grossmont High School's students, attended class in the afternoon. Grossmont's 1500 students attended in the morning. Because of rapid population growth in the area, Helix soon grew overcrowded itself. This resulted in plans to build and open El Cajon Valley High School four years after the opening of Helix. Helix is known for its amazing football program, which has prepared many NFL players, such as Reggie Bush, Levine Toilolo, and Alex Smith.\n\nSince the opening of the school, much of the campus and technology has deteriorated or become outdated. With voter approval of Proposition H in 2004 and Proposition U in 2008, Helix High School will undergo remodeling projects. These projects include a new administration building, a new science building, a new performing arts center, and remodeling of all standard classrooms.\n\nThe remodeling of the campus has already started, and has been completed for buildings 10, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 1100, 1140, 1200 the new science building (1800), the performing arts center (900) and the lecture hall (1300), which officially opened in January 2014. The remaining buildings to be remodeled include 1000 (Gym), and 1600 (cafeteria). Building 800 has been demolished, and the new Administration/Student Services Office is located in its old location. In addition to the renovation efforts of the campus buildings, all of the landscaping on the school grounds will be rehabilitated.\n\nHelix Charter's Scottish tradition is brought to life by the school's pipe and drum corps. The pipe band includes several pipers and a drum corps consisting of several snare drummers, tenor drummers, and one bass drummer. During autumn, the bagpipe band accompanies the Helix Highlander Band in parades, football games, and sometimes field competitions. Additionally, they march the varsity football team out onto the field before home games. During the rest of the year, the pipe band frequently performs at paid as well as volunteer gigs, and competes at various Scottish Highland Games in Southern California. The bagpipe band is funded by the Helix Instrumental Music Association.\n\nEvery year since the school's opening in 1951, Helix and Grossmont High School have competed against each other for this musket, given to the winner of the Grossmont vs. Helix varsity football game. Typically, this football game is one of the most attended of the season. This is just one of several weapon-themed rivalry games that Helix holds with the surrounding high schools.\n\nThe name for the special education students is, \"Super Scotties.\" The Super Scotties can have helpers with them in classes. The Super Scotties go around working with the janitorial staff to help empty classroom trash bins, specifically the bottle recycling. They use the bottles to help fund the Super Scottie's version of the Olympics which was developed by Veronica Berg as her Senior Project. The Super Scottie Olympics is a school-sized version of the Olympics. It consists of the Super Scotties competing in different events while parents and other students view or assist.\n\n\nIn 2004, two of the five finalists for the individual honor in college football, the Heisman Trophy, were Helix graduates quarterback Alex Smith and running back Reggie Bush. This was the first time ever that two graduates from the same high school achieved this. Bush went on to claim the 2005 Heisman—since vacated.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1957300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957300", "title": "Round (Theosophy)", "text": "Round (Theosophy)\n\nA round, in the esoteric cosmology of Theosophy, Anthroposophy and Rosicrucianism, is a cosmic cycle or sequence by which an evolving reincarnating being passes through the various stages of existence as the Earth, the Solar System or the Cosmos comes into and passes out of manifestation.\n\nIn Theosophy, the whole process is very simple. A round is a process in a planetary chain, according to which a life cycle or life-wave of souls or monads begins its evolutionary journey on the first and most subtle or spiritual of the series of seven globes; then finishing its evolution there, proceeds to the next, and so on, to the densest or most manifest globe (usually called globe D), which in our case is the gross, physical Earth. From there it proceeds on the ascending arc, through increasingly more ethereal globes. Each of these globes are in coadunition with the physical earth, though they are not in consubstantiation with it. Each of these stages is called a \"round\", and during this time the reincarnating life wave has passed through seven Root Races.\n\nWhen the life wave has gone through all seven globes of the planetary chain, it has completed one \"planetary round\" or \"globe manvantara\". This is followed by the dissolution of the planetary chain in a nirvana (which is not the same as what Buddhism calls nirvana because it is not permanent); this period between physical manifestation is called pralaya in Hinduism. Finally, a new round begins, in which consciousness is now more developed than in the preceding round.\n\nSeven such planetary rounds (or forty-nine globe rounds) represents one kalpa or \"manvantara\" or \"day of Brahma\". This is followed by a higher \"nirvana\" or pralaya, which is the pralaya of that planetary chain. This lasts until a new planetary chain forms with its various life waves.\n\nSeven such planetary chains and their pralayas constitute a solar manvantara, after which the solar system is dissolved in a cosmic pralaya, before the cycle begins anew.\n\nThis elaborate cosmology, first formulated by Blavatsky, was also taught by de Purucker, Leadbeater, and Alice Bailey.\n\nRudolf Steiner retained the basic concept of root races and sevenfold cycles within cycles, but his description is considerably simpler, concentrating only on the seven cycles of the present Solar System. Each of these cycles constitutes a coming into being and passing out of being of the solar system, and each is divided into seven rounds, upon which man passes through seven root races. Each of Steiner's seven rounds is related to a metamorphosis of the Earth:\nFor Steiner, the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms represent \"cast off\" elements of the human entity from previous rounds. These teachings have been incorporated into the Anthroposophical Society that Steiner founded.\n\nAccording to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings about the scheme of evolution, in the beginning of a \"Day of Manifestation\" a certain collective Great Being, God, limits Himself to a certain portion of space, in which He elects to create a Solar System for the evolution of added self-consciousness. In God there are contained hosts of glorious Hierarchies and lesser beings of every grade of intelligence and stage of consciousness, from omniscience to an unconsciousness deeper than that of the deepest trance condition.\nDuring the current period of manifestation these various grades of beings are working to acquire more experience than they possessed at the beginning of this period of existence. Those who, in previous manifestations, have attained to the highest degree of development work on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness.\n\nThe period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness and to the building of the vehicles through which the spirit in man manifests, is called \"Involution\". The succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops self-consciousness into divine omniscience, is called \"Evolution\". Every evolving being has within him a \"force\" within which makes evolution not to be a mere unfoldment of latent germinal possibilities but a process where each individual differ from that of every other. This force, called \"Epigenesis\" provides the element of originality and gives scope to the creative ability which the evolving being is to cultivate that he may become a God.\n\nHeindel states that in the Solar system, God's Habitation, there are seven Worlds differentiated by God, within Himself, one after another. These Worlds have each a different \"measure\" and rate of vibration and are not separated by space or distance, as is the earth from the other planets. They are states of matter, of varying density and vibration (as are the solids, liquids and gases of the physical Earth). These Worlds are not instantaneously created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation, nor do they last until the end. The evolutionary scheme is carried through five of these Worlds in seven great Periods of manifestation, during which the evolving virgin spirit becomes first human and, then, a God.\nThe highest Worlds are created first, and as involution is to slowly carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, the finer Worlds gradually condense and new Worlds are differentiated within God to furnish the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds which have consolidated. In due time the point of greatest density, the nadir of materiality, is reached. From that point the life begins to ascend into higher Worlds, as evolution proceeds. That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated, one by one. When the purpose has been served for which a particular World was created, God ends its existence, which has become superfluous, by ceasing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sustained that World. \n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Stanford. Atogwe has also played for the Washington Redskins.\n\nAtogwe attended high school at W.F. Herman Secondary School in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. While he was there he starred in football, soccer, basketball, and track and field. In basketball, he was a three-time All-City selection and was the league MVP as a senior. Atogwe was named All-Canada, All-Ontario and All-Academic. In football, he was a two-year starter at running back and cornerback and was named the league's Defensive MVP in 1999, under head coach Harry Lumley. He was also All-city as a running back.

It was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1997 as one of the most architecturally sophisticated lighthouses built in the United States in the 19th century.\n\nAlthough Congress appropriated $9,000 to build this light in 1856, the funds were used to build a new Block Island North Light after the old one was washed away in a storm. This light was finally built in 1874, with the lamp first lit on February 1, 1875. It is a sophisticated expression of the Gothic Revival executed in brick, and was a marked contrast to earlier lighthouses, which were generally more functional in appearance. The main tower is in height, with an octagonal granite foundation and brick exterior, which rises to a cast iron parapet and open gallery around the lantern chamber. This is topped by a sixteen-sided pyramidal copper roof with a ball ventilator and lightning rod. The original roof was cast iron, and was replaced in 1994.\n\nThe keeper's house is attached to the tower by a 1-1/2 story connecting wing. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure with identical projecting 1-1/2 story kitchen wings at its rear, and a steeply pitched gable roof with windows extending into the roofline. There are porches on either side of the connector, one for each of the two dwellings in the building, which were originally identical. That on the southwest side has retained original trim, which includes beveled, bracketed posts. The north wing was designated for the keeper, while the south wing was for his assistants. The only major alterations to the residences have been for the introduction of modern plumbing (in 1938) and the repair of storm-related damage. The roof was originally shingled, and since has been covered by a variety of materials, most recently slate shingles.\n\nThe original optic was a first order Fresnel lens standing about tall with four circular wicks burning lard (pig) oil. The lard oil was replaced by kerosene in the 1880s. The lens was modified in 1929 to rotate floating on a pool of mercury, at first driven by a clockwork mechanism, which was replaced by a small electric motor.\n\nIn 1990, the Coast Guard deactivated the light and replaced it with a nearby steel tower. Because of ongoing erosion of the bluffs, in 1993 the entire 2,000 ton structure was moved about back from the cliffs. After the move, the Coast Guard decided not to retain the rotating mercury float lens, but instead installed the first order fixed lens which had been removed in 1980 from the Cape Lookout Lighthouse. Ownership of the lighthouse was transferred in 1992 to the Southeast Lighthouse Foundation, which is dedicated to its preservation.\n\nThe light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997. The latter designation was made in recognition of the light's historic importance as an aid to navigation, and for its sophisticated architecture, which was only matched by the Cleveland Light, which was demolished in the early 20th century. As of its 1997 designation, it was one of only 12 lighthouses which used a first-order Fresnel lens.\n\nThe lighthouse has a small museum and gift shop in the base of the tower. The tower is open during the summer season offering guided tours to the top, for a fee of $10 as of September 2015. Proceeds from tours are used for restoration of the lighthouse.\n\n\n"}

It is served by Sydney Trains T9 Northern Line services.\n\nThe Main Northern line between Sydney and Newcastle was constructed in two distinct stages and in the earliest years, was worked as two separate railway systems.\n\nThe line between Sydney (actually the junction at Strathfield) and the Hawkesbury River was opened in April 1887, with the terminus being on the southern bank of the Hawkesbury River. The line between Newcastle and the northern bank of the Hawkesbury River (near present-day Wondabyne) was opened in January 1888.\n\nThe line was completed through between Sydney and Newcastle with the opening of the massive bridge over the Hawkesbury River in 1889.\n\nThe Strathfield to Hornsby section of the Northern line was opened for traffic on 17 September 1886. The line was constructed as a \"single line\" and Hornsby became the temporary terminus and remained so until the extension to Hawkesbury River was opened in 1887. At the time of the opening, stations were provided at Ryde, Dundas (later Eastwood), Field of Mars (now Epping), Beecroft, Thornleigh and Hornsby.\n\nThe approved plans for the opening of the line between Strathfield and Hornsby included platforms at Rhodes (and Meadow Bank and Pennant Hills) however, no arrangements had been made to bring them into service by the day of the opening. The precise date of their completion cannot be ascertained, but they were included in the timetable dated 5 April 1887. A single brick-faced platform was provided on the Down side of the single line near the present day location at the time of opening.\n\nThe line between Strathfield and Hornsby was duplicated in March 1892. With duplication, a new Up platform was provided at Rhodes, opposite the existing Down platform.\n\nSafeworking and interlocking came to Rhodes in October 1909 and a signal box was built on the Up platform. In 1912, the Down relief road was extended from Concord West passing behind the Down main platform, but no platform was provided for the relief line. A footbridge was added in 1915 to span all tracks and allow access to the platforms via steps.\n\nElectrification and automatic signalling was extended to Rhodes in 1928 and a platform was added to serve the Down relief line, in effect creating an island platform for the down lines.\n\nRhodes developed into a predominately industrial area, being the base for railway locomotive manufacturer Tulloch. A number of mill and industrial sidings, serving various undertakings were laid near Rhodes railway station over the years.\n\nTo the north of the station, the line crosses the Parramatta River via the John Whitton Bridge. This opened in May 1980 replacing the original iron lattice bridge.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s with the gated village/suburb of Liberty Grove (the luxury suburb opened in 1998) the area was redeveloped. It now includes residential apartments, commercial offices and the Rhodes Waterside shopping centre. In the 2000s, Rhodes station underwent a major redevelopment.\n\nBoth the Up platform and the Down island platform have been re-built using modern materials, the offices and buildings on the platforms have been replaced by a Booking Office on the overhead (new) footbridge between the platforms. Lifts have been provided between platforms and the overhead footbridge. The industrial sidings which were part of the Rhodes station arrangement were placed out of use and removed some years ago.\n\nIn June 2015, a southbound loop (track name: Up Relief) opened to the south of the station as part of the Northern Sydney Freight Corridor project.\n\nThe crossovers can be used to terminate northbound trains during trackwork.\n\nStand A, Concord Rd\nStand B, Concord Rd\nStand C, Walker St\nStand D, Walker St\n\nThe small, gable roofed, weatherboard, waiting shed building without an awning (type 14) on Platform 2/3, dating from 1887, is listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register. It is not in use. It is of poor integrity, as the context of the waiting shed has been compromised by loss of surrounding historic structures.\n\nThe waiting shed has significance for its rare example of a small 1880s timber waiting shed on platforms 2/3, the only remaining example in NSW. This is a rare example of a small early timber building to survive on a suburban line and is of high significance as it represents the form of many similar stations that have been removed or replaced with other buildings.\n\nRhodes railway station (Waiting shed) was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nRhodes Railway Station (Waiting shed) has significance for its rare example of a small 1880s timber waiting shed on platforms 2/3, the only remaining example in NSW.\n\n"}

Howe\n\nEdgar Watson Howe (May 3, 1853 – October 3, 1937), was an American novelist and newspaper and magazine editor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was perhaps best known for his magazine, \"E.W. Howe's Monthly\". Howe was well traveled and known for his sharp wit in his editorials.\n\nHowe was born May 3, 1853 in Wabash County, Indiana, in a community now known as Treaty. His father was Henry Howe, a farmer and Methodist circuit rider, and his mother Elizabeth Irwin Howe. Howe spent most of his childhood in Harrison County, Missouri, where his family moved when he was 3, first to Fairview, and then to Bethany around 1864.\n\nHowe's father was a vocal abolitionist, opposing slavery on religious grounds. When the Civil War broke out, Henry Howe joined to fight for the Union. Returning to Missouri before the end of the war, he purchased a newspaper in Bethany and informed his family of his intention of using it to advocate his cause.\n\nIn 1870, while working at the \"Nemaha Valley Journal\" in Falls City, Nebraska, he met Clara Frank. They were married in 1875, when Howe returned to Nebraska from Colorado. Howe had five children with Clara. Two of their children, Bessie and Ned, died young within a few days of each other in 1878. Two sons, James and Gene, eventually followed Howe in the news business, and daughter Mateel became a novelist. Howe and Clara divorced in 1901, and Howe never remarried.\n\nHowe began his journalistic career in March 1873 when, as a 19-year-old, he came to Golden, Colorado, from Falls City, Nebraska, and partnered with William F. Dorsey to acquire the \"Golden Eagle\" newspaper. Renaming it the \"Golden Globe\", it was the second main newspaper of Golden and served a Republican readership and political bent. Howe, who took over complete ownership by the end of the year, quickly gained a reputation as a sharp-witted editor in the community that would foreshadow his national fame.\n\nWithin a couple of years Howe sold the \"Globe\" to his brother A. J. Howe and partner William Grover Smith, and moved to Falls City, Nebraska in 1875, where he established a new \"Globe\" newspaper, affectionately called the \"Little Globe\". In 1875, he merged this with the \"Nemaha Valley Journal\" to create the \"Globe-Journal\".\n\nIn 1877 Howe established the Atchison, Kansas newspaper \"Globe\" (Atchison Daily Globe), which he continued to edit for twenty-five years before retiring in 1911. Having been raised Methodist, he described himself as identifying with Methodism but is essentially a cultural Christian, according to his writing.\n\nHowe's first novel, \"The Story of a Country Town\" (1883), was also his best-known. He had difficulty getting the book published and eventually printed it himself. He sent copies to Mark Twain and William Dean Howells by whom the work was well-received, thus attracting a publisher for the work. Howe's subsequent novels were neither critically nor popularly successful.\n\nA 1919 edition of his \"Ventures in Common Sense\" featured a foreword by celebrated American writer (and cynic) H. L. Mencken, to whom Howe has been compared. Mencken was a fan of \"E. W. Howe's Monthly\", which he called, \"one of the most curious as it is certainly one of the most entertaining of all the 25,000 periodicals now issuing in the United States.\"\n\nHowe died in 1937, at the age of 84, near Atchison.\n\n\n\n\n"}
